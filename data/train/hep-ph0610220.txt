    "although the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , of the strong and electroweak interactions describes correctly particle physics at energy ranges currently attainable , one of its basic ingredients , the scalar higgs sector , still remains untested . in the sm ,",
    "the higgs sector consists of a single @xmath15 doublet , and after spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) it remains a physical state , the higgs boson ( @xmath16 ) , whose mass is not predicted in the theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the sm is not expected to be the ultimate theoretical structure responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) @xcite .",
    "one of the most simple extensions of the sm is the so called two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "there are four classes of 2hdm which naturally avoid tree - level flavor - changing neutral currents that can be induced by higgs boson exchange @xcite .",
    "these models include a higgs sector with two scalar doublets , which give masses to the up and down - type fermions as well as the gauge bosons .",
    "model ii is particularly interesting , where one of the higgs scalar doublet couples to the up - components of isodoublets while the other to the down - components .",
    "model ii is that utilized in susy theories .",
    "the 2hdm(ii ) has a rich structure and predicts interesting phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the physical spectrum consists of two neutral cp - even states ( @xmath17 ) and one cp - odd ( @xmath18 ) , as well as a pair of charged scalar particles ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the advantage of such model is the fact that any higgs sector built only upon doublets preserves naturally the lowest - order electroweak relation @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , which has been tested with a good accuracy . on the phenomenological side ,",
    "an important aspect of the 2hdm is that the higgs sector may provide an additional source of cp violation @xcite .",
    "several experimental lower limits on the charged higgs boson mass in this model have been reported in the literature : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24    further , based on the discussions on @xmath2 given in refs . @xcite and @xcite , we restrict ourselves by taking the following upper limit on @xmath2 @xmath25    large - scale neutrino telescopes @xcite have as a main goal the detection of ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) cosmic neutrinos ( @xmath26 ev ) produced outside the atmosphere ( neutrinos produced by galactic cosmic rays interacting with interstellar gas , and extragalactic neutrinos ) @xcite .",
    "uhe neutrinos can be detected by observing long - range muons and tau - leptons decays produced in charged - current neutrino - nucleon interactions .",
    "uhe tau - neutrinos are generated through neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the detection of uhe neutrinos will provide us with the possibility to observe @xmath27-collisions with a neutrino energy in the range @xmath28 ev @xmath29 ev and a target nucleon at rest . an enlightening discussion on uhe neutrino interactions is given by r. gandhi _ et al .",

    "we discuss in this paper the cross section of the deep inelastic process @xmath30",
    "( @xmath31 an isoscalar nucleon ) , in the context of the sm and of the 2hdm(ii ) .",
    "we perform our numerical calculations using the parton model @xcite with the parton distribution functions reported by j. pumplin _",
    "we use the cteq pdfs provided in an @xmath32 active flavors scheme .",
    "our aim is to calculate how large can be the contribution of diagrams , in which a charged higgs boson is exchanged , to the total cross section of the mentioned inclusive process in the frame of the 2hdm(ii ) . in the 2hdm(ii )",
    "the couplings of the down - type quarks and charged leptons are proportional to @xmath33 .",

    "v , we discuss the contribution of charged higgs boson to the charged current cross section of the @xmath7 collision , the induced variation on the mean inelasticity @xmath37 and hence the effects on the possibility of detecting cosmic tau - neutrinos .",
    "finally , in section vi , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review the notation and the physical region for the parameters of the inclusive process @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 stand for the incoming neutrino , the target nucleon and the outgoing lepton @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we will denote the four - momenta of these particles by @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . in accordance with the kinematics for the collision of a neutrino on a target nucleon ,",
    "the following construction is chosen : @xmath45    as usual , we define the invariants @xcite : @xmath46 and the dimensionless variables : @xmath47 the physical region of these kinematical variables is obtained by requiring that the scalar products of any two particle four - momenta be positive and the determinant @xmath48 of the three independent four - momenta ( whenever possible we will neglect the fermion masses ) : @xmath49 \\delta_3(p , p',p_{\\cal n})= \\left| \\begin{array}{ccc } 0 & pp ' & pp_{\\cal n}\\\\ p'p & 0 & p'p_{\\cal n}\\\\ p_{\\cal n}p & p_{\\cal n}p ' & 0\\\\ \\end{array } \\right| \\nonumber\\\\[1mm]\\ ] ] be positive @xcite .    from the non - negative character of the scalar products we find : @xmath50 explicit evaluation of @xmath48 using ( [ invar ] ) , ( [ dimless ] ) and ( [ del3 ] )",
    "gives : @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "the condition @xmath53 does not lead to additional restrictions on the physical region .",
    "the expressions given in ( [ physreg1 ] ) , define the physical region for the dimensionless variables @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "we have taken all fermion masses to be zero , which implies that in the calculation of the total cross section the integration over the momentum transfer square extends up to zero .",
    "however , the parton distributions can be used only when @xmath56 is not too small . furthermore , in order to separate deep inelastic from elastic scattering , a cut on the invariant mass @xmath57 of the unobserved particles in the final state is required .",
    "therefore , besides the kinematical conditions ( [ physreg1 ] ) , we also have in general the following constraints : @xmath58 the cuts for @xmath56 and @xmath57 constrain further the physically allowed region for the process ( [ proc1 ] ) .",
    "the physical region can now be written in terms of the dimensionless variables as follows : @xmath59    the physically allowed region can also be expressed as @xmath60",
    "the differential cross section for the inclusive reaction @xmath63 where @xmath1 is an isoscalar nucleon , at the lowest order in @xmath64 in the frame of the sm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figsm ] ) is given as follows @xcite : @xmath65 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath56 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are defined in ( [ invar ] ) and ( [ dimless ] ) and @xmath66 stands for the nucleon mass .",
    "the quantities @xmath67 and @xmath68 are given as @xmath69 where the valence and sea parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , can be expressed as @xmath72 where the pdfs @xmath73 describe the quark @xmath74 content of the proton .",
    "in other words , the parton distribution functions @xmath73 give the probabilities to find a quark @xmath74 inside a proton with the fraction @xmath54 of the proton momentum : @xmath75 , in a scattering process with momentum transfer square @xmath56 .",
    "in the case of the standard model the couplings of the fermions to the @xmath9 boson are given by the lagrangian @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 stand for the up- and down - components of the fermion doublet .",

    "on the other side , taking the elements of the ckm - matrix @xmath89 , the couplings of the fermions to the @xmath14 boson are given by the lagrangian @xcite @xmath90     at the lowest order in @xmath64 in the 2hdm(ii ) ( @xmath79 stands for @xmath79- , @xmath80- and @xmath81-quark ; and @xmath82 stands for @xmath82- and @xmath83-quark ) . ]",
    "we present results for the case of unpolarized deep inelastic process @xmath62 with a neutrino energy in the range @xmath91 ev @xmath92 ev and the nucleon at rest , @xmath93 a target nucleon . we take @xmath91 ev @xmath94 which leads to a condition where all fermion masses become negligible with respect to the total energy @xmath95 , even the top quark mass .",
    "we take cuts of @xmath96 gev@xmath97 and 10 gev@xmath97 for @xmath56 and the invariant mass @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "these values for the cuts are suited for the parton distribution functions of j. pumplin _",
    "@xcite which we will use in our calculations .",
    "we have checked numerically that the total cross section rates do not depend on the choice of the cuts on the momentum transfer square @xmath56 , when they take on values of a few gev@xmath97 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the propagators involved in the calculation of the cross section are @xmath98 and @xmath99    we perform our numerical calculations taking for the quark masses : @xmath100 mev , @xmath101 mev , @xmath102 gev , @xmath103 mev , @xmath104 gev and @xmath105 gev .",
    "for the evaluation of the @xmath106 coupling we take @xmath107 and @xmath108 mev .",
    "also , we take @xmath109 gev for the mass of the charged boson @xmath9 @xcite    taking into account the constraints on @xmath110 given by ( [ bound2a ] ) and ( [ bound2b ] ) , we will present results for three different cases : ( i ) @xmath111 gev ; ( ii ) @xmath112 gev ; ( iii ) @xmath113 gev . in all these cases , the conditions ( [ bound1 ] ) and ( [ bound3 ] ) will be fulfilled .",
    "hence , we restrict our numerical analysis to the region @xmath114 and 90 gev@xmath115 gev .",
    "we display in our numerical results for the total cross section as a function of @xmath118 in the range @xmath91 ev @xmath119 ev , with @xmath120 in tables  [ tab : t1]-[tab : t3 ] . in the second column of these tables",
    "we give results for the sm .",
    "the numerical results for the 2hdm(ii ) are given in the third - sixth columns of table  [ tab : t1 ] ( case i ) , table  [ tab : t2 ] ( case ii ) , and table  [ tab : t3 ] ( case iii ) .",
    "tables [ tab : t1 ] , [ tab : t2 ] and [ tab : t3 ] show that the total cross section @xmath117 becomes larger as @xmath2 increases and/or as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "we present in our results for the ratio @xmath122 as a function of @xmath118 in the range @xmath91 ev @xmath119 ev , with @xmath120 , in table  [ tab : t4 ] ( case i ) , table  [ tab : t5 ] ( case ii ) , and table  [ tab : t6 ] ( case iii ) .",
    "we observe in tables [ tab : t4 ] , [ tab : t5 ] and [ tab : t6 ] that the ratio @xmath123 becomes larger as @xmath2 increases and/or as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "furthermore , we notice that @xmath123 depends on @xmath118 .",
    "we see that for @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the greater @xmath118 , the larger ratio @xmath123 becomes .",
    "finally , in table  [ tab : t7 ] we compare the contribution to @xmath13 from the different allowed initial quarks ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2hdm](b ) ) , taking @xmath126 gev and @xmath125 .",
    "we observe in this table that the contribution from the bottom quark dominates by far ( a similar behavior is obtained in the other cases ) .",
    "this fact implies that the contribution of the @xmath14 exchange diagrams to the total cross section of the @xmath127 scattering in the frame of the 2hdm(ii ) is the same regardless of whether the nucleon is a proton , a neutron or an isoscalar nucleon , because these particles have the same content of b - quark .",
    "we woul like to emphasize that the @xmath14 contribution practically always gives a top quark in the final state , resulting in a much larger values of the mass invariant @xmath57 and dimensionless parameter @xmath55 in the 2hdm with respect to the corresponding values in the case of the sm .",
    "such a large component of the cross section having a top quark event in the final state could have other recognizable features in the eas experiments , which may be worth looking into .",
    "cosmic neutrino fluxes can initiate air - showers through interaction in the atmosphere , or in the earth .",
    "neutrino trajectories will be going down in a nearly horizontal way in the former case , whereas in a earth - skimming manner in the latter case .",
    "thus , it is important to know the acceptance ( event rate / flux ) of proposed air shower experiments for detecting both types of neutrino -initiated events [ horizontal air - showers ( has ) and upgoing ( earth - skimming ) air - showers ( uas ) ] .",
    "these acceptances for fluorescence detectors have been calculated in @xcite for experiments as high resolution fly s eye detector ( hires ) @xcite , pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite , and the cosmic ray tau neutrino telescopes ( crtnt ) @xcite , which are anchored to the ground , and at experiments as extreme universe space observatory ( euso ) @xcite and orbiting wide angle light - collectors ( owl ) @xcite , which are proposed to orbit around the earth . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it is stated that the very different dependence on the cross section of the has ( linear ) and uas ( non linear ) acceptances will provide a practical method to measure the charged current cross section of the neutrino nucleon scattering @xmath128 .",
    "one simply has to exploit the ratio of uas to has event rates .",
    "however , one assumption made in ref.@xcite was taking that @xmath129 .",
    "this is valid in the sm , but it is no longer valid in the 2hdm(ii ) , because the @xmath130 could be twice larger than @xmath131 in this model .",
    "hence , the neutrino charged current interaction mean - free path ( introduced in ref.@xcite ) could be for @xmath132 one half of that for @xmath133 and @xmath134 , in the mentioned model .",
    "therefore , the existence of charged higgs bosons could imply a large deviation from the results for the acceptances for space based ( or ground based ) tau - neutrino detectors presented in fig .",
    "7 of ref.@xcite .",
    "further , it was already pointed out in ref.@xcite , that besides the obvious role of the neutrino cross section in the actual interaction that leads to the possible neutrino detection there are other more subtle effects .",
    "the @xmath55 distribution of the cross section also has an impact on the detection rate @xcite .",
    "it is clear from eq.([dcssm ] ) and eq.([dcs2hdmh ] ) that the @xmath55 distribution of the charged current interaction could change due to the effects of charged higgs bosons .",
    "in fact , in table  [ tab : t8 ] we show how the mean inelasticity @xmath12 would change in the thdm(ii ) ( we present only numerical results for the case i , in which the effects are maximal ) .",
    "our results obtained for @xmath37 in the frame of the sm are in good agreement with those reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "we observe in table  [ tab : t8 ] that @xmath135 for @xmath136 gev , @xmath125 and @xmath137 ev .",
    "such a drastic variation in @xmath12 could induce a large variation in the possibility of detecting ultra - high energy tau - neutrinos through inclined showers @xcite .",
    "we end this section saying that the possible effects of charged higgs bosons on the detection of cosmic tau - neutrinos deserve future detailed investigations .",
    "we have calculated the total cross section rates for the deep inelastic process @xmath62 , where @xmath1 is an isoscalar nucleon , in the frame of the sm and the 2hdm(ii ) . in the case of the 2hdm(ii ) we have taken into account the contribution of the diagrams in which a charged higgs boson is exchanged @xmath13 .",
    "we obtained our numerical results considering the nucleon at rest and according to the following conditions : taking @xmath138 gev , @xmath139 , a neutrino energy in the range @xmath91 ev @xmath92 ev and setting cuts of @xmath140 gev@xmath97 and 10 gev@xmath97 for the momentum transfer square @xmath56 and the invariant mass ( @xmath57 ) , respectively . we made use of the parton distribution functions of j. pumplin _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "those provided in an @xmath32 active flavors scheme . in order to take into account the experimental data",
    ", we restricted our numerical analysis to the region @xmath114 and 90 gev@xmath141 gev , with the additional constraint @xmath6 gev .",
    "we have shown that the most important contribution to @xmath13 comes from the @xmath14-exchange diagram with an initial b - quark ( and hence an outgoing t - quark ) .",
    "this fact implies that the contribution of the @xmath14 exchange diagrams to the total cross section of the @xmath127 scattering in the frame of the 2hdm(ii ) is the same regardless of whether the nucleon is a proton , a neutron or an isoscalar nucleon , because these particles have the same content of b - quark . on the other hand",
    ", we would like to stress that the @xmath14 contribution leads to a top quark in the final state and that such a large component of the cross section having a top quark event in the final state could have characteristic aspects in the eas experiments .",
    "we found that the ratio @xmath123 becomes larger as @xmath2 increases and/or as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "we also found that the ratio @xmath123 depends on @xmath118 .",
    "in particular , we obtain that for @xmath124 and @xmath125 : the greater @xmath118 , the larger ratio @xmath123 becomes .",
    "we showed that the contribution of the charged higgs boson exchange diagrams can lead to a sizeable enhancement with respect to the sm cross section rates for the charged current @xmath7 deep inelastic scattering .",
    "for the case of an ultrahigh energy tau - neutrino with @xmath142 ev colliding on a target nucleon such enhancement reached @xmath143 provided that @xmath125 and @xmath136 gev .",
    "besides , we obtain @xmath144 for the same values of @xmath118 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . this enhancement and the induced variation in the mean inelasticity",
    "@xmath12 could lead to sizeable effects in the acceptance of the cosmic tau - neutrino detectors at space based experiments such as the euso and owl proposals and at ground - based experiments such as pao , hires and the crtnt .",
