    "despite the tremendous effort that has led to the discovery of neutrino mass  @xcite the mechanism of neutrino mass generation will remain open for years to come ( a detailed analysis of the three ",
    "neutrino oscillation parameters can be found in  @xcite ) . the most popular mechanism to generate neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "although the seesaw fits naturally in so(10 ) unification models , we currently have no clear hints that uniquely point towards any unification scheme .",
    "therefore it may well be that neutrino masses arise from physics having nothing to do with unification , such as certain seesaw variants  @xcite , and models with radiative generation  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the specific case of low - energy supersymmetry with violation of r  parity , as the origin of neutrino mass .",
    "r  parity is defined as @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 denoting spin , baryon and lepton numbers , respectively  @xcite .    in these models",
    "r  parity can be broken either explicitly or spontaneously . in the first case we consider the bilinear r ",
    "parity violation model , the simplest effective description of r - parity violation  @xcite .",
    "the model not only accounts for the observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixing  @xcite , but also makes predictions for the decay branching ratios of the lightest supersymmetric particle  @xcite from the current measurements of neutrino mixing angles  @xcite . in the second case r ",
    "parity violation takes place `` a la higgs '' , i.e. , spontaneously , due to non - zero sneutrino vacuum expectation values ( vevs )  @xcite . in this case one of the neutral cp - odd scalars is identified with the majoron , @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast with the seesaw majoron , ours is characterized by a small scale ( tev - like ) and carries only one unit of lepton number . in previous studies",
    "@xcite it was noted that the spontaneously broken r  parity ( ` sbrp ` ) model leads to the possibility of invisibly decaying higgs bosons , provided there is an 1 singlet superfield @xmath5 coupling to the electroweak doublet higgses , the same that appears in the ` nmssm ` .",
    "we have reanalyzed @xcite this issue taking into account the small masses indicated by current neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "we have shown explicitly that the invisible higgs boson decay eq .",
    "( [ eq : hjj ] ) , @xmath6 can be the most important mode of higgs boson decay .",
    "this is remarkable , given the smallness of neutrino masses required to fit current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "since ` brpv ` has been discussed in the literature several times @xcite we will repeat only the main features of the model here . we will follow the notation of @xcite . the simplest bilinear model",
    "( we call it the ` mssm ` ) is characterized by the superpotential @xmath7 in this equation @xmath8 is the ordinary superpotential of the ` mssm ` , @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 are generation indices , @xmath11 are @xmath12 indices .",
    "we have three additional terms that break r - parity , @xmath13 these bilinear terms , together with the corresponding terms in the soft supersymmetric ( ` susy ` ) breaking part of the lagrangian , @xmath14 define the minimal model , which we will adopt throughout this paper .",
    "the appearance of the lepton number violating terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wrpv ] ) leads , in general , to non - zero vacuum expectation values for the scalar neutrinos @xmath15 , called @xmath16 in the rest of this paper , in addition to the vevs @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the ` mssm ` higgs fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "together with the bilinear parameters @xmath21 , the @xmath16 induce mixing between various particles which in the ` mssm ` are distinguished ( only ) by lepton number ( or r  parity ) .",
    "mixing between the neutrinos and the neutralinos of the ` mssm ` generates a non - zero mass for one specific linear superposition of the three neutrino flavor states of the model at tree - level while 1-loop corrections provide mass for the remaining two neutrino states  @xcite .      in the basis",
    "@xmath22 the neutral fermions mass terms in the lagrangian are given by @xmath23 where the neutralino / neutrino mass matrix is @xmath24\\ ] ] with @xmath25   \\quad ; \\quad m=\\left [    \\begin{array}{c } a_1 \\cr",
    "a_2 \\cr a_3   \\end{array }    \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath26 .",
    "this neutralino / neutrino mass matrix is diagonalized by @xmath27      if the parameters are small ( we will show below that this is indeed the case ) , then we can block - diagonalize @xmath28 approximately to the form diag(@xmath29 ) @xmath30 with @xmath31 the matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 diagonalize @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37    so we get at tree level only one massive neutrino , the two other eigenstates remaining massless",
    ". the tree level value will give the atmospheric mass scale , while the other states will get mass at one loop level .",
    "therefore the ` brpv ` model produces a hierarchical mass spectrum .",
    "we will show below how the one loop masses are generated .",
    "the self  energy for the neutralino / neutrino is  @xcite ,    @xmath38 -\\left [ p_l \\pi^l_{ij } + p_r \\pi^r_{ij } \\right]\\right\\}\\ ] ]    ( 0,0 ) ( -0.5,10 )    then the pole mass is , @xmath39 with @xmath40_{\\delta=0}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 an the parameter that appears in dimensional reduction is , @xmath42 explicit expressions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in ref.@xcite a complete analysis of the parameter space where this happens is presented .",
    "the ` brpv ` model is a simple extension of the ` mssm ` that leads to a very rich phenomenology .",
    "we have calculated the one  loop corrected masses and mixings for the neutrinos in a completely consistent way , including the rg equations and correctly minimizing the potential .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to get easily maximal mixing for the atmospheric neutrinos and large angle msw , as it is preferred by the present neutrino data .",
    "we have also obtained approximate formulas for the solar mass and solar mixing angle , that we found to be very good , precisely in the region of parameters favored by this data .",
    "we emphasize that the ` lsp ` decays inside the detectors , thus leading to a very different phenomenology than the ` mssm ` .",
    "no matter what supersymmetric particle is the ` lsp ` measurements of branching ratios at future accelerators will provide a definite test of the ` brpv ` model as a viable model for explaining the neutrino properties .",
    "we have also discussed the possibility of invisibly decaying higgs boson in the context of the ` sbrp ` model .",
    "one of the neutral cp - odd scalars in this model , is the nambu - goldstone boson associated to the breaking of lepton number , the majoron @xmath4 .",
    "neutrino masses and mixings can easily be explained .",
    "in contrast to the ` mssm ` , where the higgs boson can decay invisibly only to supersymmetric states , in our case the higgs boson can decay mainly invisibly through the decay @xmath43 . as a result , our analysis indicates that invisibly decaying higgs bosons should be an important topic in the agenda of future accelerators , such as the large hadron collider and the next linear collider .",
