    "thompson s groups serve as a wide range of interesting examples of unusual group - theoretic behavior .",
    "the family of thompson s groups includes the original groups described by thompson ( commonly denoted @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) as well as generalizations in many different directions .",
    "the bulk of these generalizations includes groups which can be regarded as self - maps of the unit interval .",
    "brin @xcite describes higher - dimensional groups @xmath0 , generalizations of thompson s group @xmath4 , which are described naturally in terms of dyadic self - maps of @xmath1-dimensional cubes .",
    "little is known about these groups aside from their simplicity .",
    "brin describes these elements geometrically in terms of dyadic interpolations of collections of dyadic blocks , and gives presentations for the group @xmath5 .",
    "we describe elements in higher - dimensional thompson s groups as being given by tree - pair diagrams .",
    "though tree - pair diagrams usually take advantage of the natural left - to - right ordering of subintervals of the unit interval , by using several types of carets , brin gives a a description of elements of @xmath0 via tree - pair diagrams .",
    "a natural question is how the size of these tree - pair diagrams corresponds to the word length of elements with respect to finite generating sets .",
    "we give upper and lower bounds for the word lengths of elements of higher - dimensional thompson s groups @xmath0 respect to finite generating sets , in terms of the size of tree - pair descriptions of elements .",
    "an element with a reduced tree - pair description of size @xmath6 has word length between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( up to the standard affine equivalences ) with respect to the standard finite generating set .",
    "this of course also thus holds for any finite generating set .",
    "the authors are grateful for helpful conversations with matt brin , melanie stein and claire wladis .",
    "brin @xcite describes higher - dimensional thompson s groups @xmath0 , giving presentations and showing that the group @xmath5 is simple .",
    "here we summarize the relevant properties of the the groups @xmath0 for use in this article .",
    "we denote the unit interval @xmath9 $ ] as @xmath10 , and correspondingly @xmath11 denotes the @xmath1-dimensional unit cube .",
    "an element of @xmath4 is given by two finite rooted binary trees with the same number of leaves and a permutation , which represents a bijection between the leaves of the two trees .",
    "hence an element of @xmath4 can be seen as a triple @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are trees with @xmath15 leaves , and @xmath16 .",
    "each binary tree can be seen as a way of subdividing the interval @xmath10 into dyadic subintervals of the type @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "a rooted binary tree gives instructions for successive halvings of subintervals to obtain a particular dyadic subdivision .",
    "given two binary trees with @xmath1 leaves , and a permutation in @xmath20 , an element in @xmath4 is represented as a left - continuous map of the interval into itself , sending each interval in the first subdivision to a corresponding interval in the second subdivision , as specified by the given permutation .",
    "for more details on the group @xmath4 , including presentations and a proof of its simplicity , see cannon , floyd and parry @xcite as well as brin @xcite .    to obtain an element in @xmath5 we will define a partition of @xmath21 into dyadic rectangles of the type @xmath22\\times \\left[\\frac{j}{2^s},\\frac{j+1}{2^s}\\right].\\ ] ] we can again regard such partitions as being obtained by a successive halving process , but now there are two possible halvings that can occur at each stage to a specified dyadic rectangle a horizontal or a vertical subdivision .",
    "we can obtain a refinement of any dyadic partition of @xmath21 via iterated horizontal and vertical subdivisions .",
    "this gives means of describing elements of @xmath5 as pairs of dyadic subdivisions , each with @xmath23 rectangles , and a permutation in @xmath24 giving the bijection between the rectangles .",
    "we can represent elements of @xmath5 also with pairs of binary trees .",
    "since there are two types of subdivisions , vertical and horizontal , we will consider binary trees which contain two types of carets ,  vertical \" and  horizontal \" carets , represented by  triangular \" and  square \" carets , respectively .    to fix a convention",
    ", we will represent a vertical subdivision with a traditional triangular caret , where the left and right leaves naturally represent the left and right rectangles .",
    "a horizontal subdivision will be represented by a square caret , and in it , the left leaf represents the bottom rectangle , and the right leaf represents the top rectangle , as shown in figure [ carets ]",
    ".     +    see figure [ tree - div ] for an example of a partition of @xmath21 and its corresponding binary tree .",
    "every dyadic partition of the unit square can be obtained with a binary tree with these two types of carets .    for the general groups @xmath0 , the partitions are divisions of the unit @xmath1-cube in @xmath1-rectangles of dyadic lengths , and the binary trees have @xmath1 types of carets . for simplicity , we state our results for @xmath5 , but all of the results below extend naturally to the cases for @xmath0 , with @xmath25 .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=576 ] +    the fact that we have vertical and horizontal subdivisions brings new relations to the group .",
    "these relations arise when both types of subdivisions are combined in different orders to obtain different descriptions of the same dyadic partition of @xmath21 .",
    "the obvious relation ( and the one from which all other relations are deducible ) is the combination of one subdivision of each type in the two possible orders , as illustrated in figure [ relation ] .",
    "+    subdividing in both the vertical and horizontal directions once , but in the two possible orders , gives the same dyadic partitions , but according to our convention the resulting rectangles are numbered in different way .",
    "this fact makes using tree diagrams to express the multiplication of elements tricky and quite unwieldy for large elements . even though the leaves of the two - caret - type tree diagrams are ordered in a natural way , this order is not apparent in the square , and it is not preserved when different diagrams represent the same partition .",
    "thus , there are diagrams representing the identity whose leaves are ordered in different ways an example is illustrated in figure [ weird - id ] .",
    "brin @xcite showed that these groups @xmath0 are finitely generated and gave several generating sets for @xmath5 .",
    "as it is common with groups of the thompson family , there is an infinite presentation , which is useful for its symmetry and regularity , which has a finite subpresentation . for the purposes of word length , we work with the standard finite generating set described by brin .",
    "we will next define the families of generators for @xmath5 . as it is customary in thompson s groups , see @xcite , the generators are built on a backbone of an all - right tree with only vertical carets .    1 .",
    "the generators @xmath26 involve only vertical subdivisions , and they are the traditional generators of thompson s group @xmath2 .",
    "the generators @xmath27 have the relevant caret replaced by a horizontal one .",
    "3 .   the generators @xmath28 have the last caret of the all - right tree of horizontal type , and they are used to build horizontal carets on the right - hand - side of the tree , as will be seen later .",
    "4 .   the generators @xmath29 and @xmath30 are permutations built on an all - right tree with only vertical carets .",
    "these generators are exactly equal to those for the subgroup @xmath4 appearing as the purely vertical elements .    , title=\"fig:\",width=307 ] +",
    "the families @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 generate @xmath5 .    _",
    "proof : _ since our proof is actually quite different from that of brin s , we will include it here , and use aspects of it later for metric considerations .",
    "an element of @xmath5 is now a triple @xmath31 ) , where the two trees are composed of the two types of carets .",
    "first , we subdivide a given element into three elements : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the all - right tree with @xmath15 leaves and only vertical carets .",
    "clearly @xmath33 is product of the permutation generators , as it is the case in @xmath4 already .    to obtain the element @xmath32 , we will concentrate first on the backbone of the tree @xmath13 ; that is , the sequence of carets in the right - hand - side . if this sequence of carets has horizontal carets in the positions @xmath36 , then the product of the generators @xmath37 produces exactly a backbone with horizontal carets in the desired positions .",
    "once the backbone is constructed , then each new caret is obtained by a generator of the type @xmath38 or @xmath39 . to attach a vertical caret from the leaf labelled @xmath40 , we only need to multiply by @xmath38 . similarly , to attach a horizontal caret to leaf @xmath40 , we multiply by @xmath39 . this multiplication process is shown in figure [ multi ] , with an example illustrated in figure [ word ] .",
    "-th leaf by multiplying by @xmath38 or @xmath39.,title=\"fig:\",width=480 ] +    this proves that the element @xmath32 is product of the generators @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath41 , and using inverses , we have that the entire group is generated by the full family of generators",
    ".     +    an element of the type @xmath32 is called a _ positive _ element of @xmath5 .",
    "positive elements can always be written as products of the generators @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath41 without using their inverses .",
    "in the process of proving brin s theorem , we have obtained the following result :    [ semi - normal form ] for an element of @xmath5 , with respect to the standard infinite generating set @xmath42 , we have :    * a positive element of @xmath5 always admits an expression of the type @xmath43 where the @xmath44 are words on the positive generators @xmath38 and @xmath39 and never their inverses , and also where @xmath45 * any element of @xmath5 always admits an expression @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are positive elements , and @xmath49 is a permutation on an all - right vertical tree , and thus a word in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this expression will be used as a semi - normal form for elements of @xmath5 .",
    "we will be interested of metric properties up to the standard affine equivalence , defined here .    given two functions @xmath52 we say that @xmath53 if there exists a constant @xmath54 such that for all @xmath55 , we have that @xmath56 . also , we say that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are equivalent , written @xmath59 if @xmath53 and @xmath60 .",
    "elements of thompson s groups admit representations as diagrams with binary trees in one form or another , perhaps with associated permutations or braids between the leaves . for several of these groups , the distance @xmath61 of an element @xmath62 to the identity",
    "is closely related with the number of carets @xmath63 of the minimal diagram indicating that the complexity of the minimal ( reduced ) diagram is a good indication of the size of the element .    in thompson",
    "s groups @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the two functions are equivalent , for both groups we have that @xmath64 , see @xcite and @xcite",
    ". this result can not hold in @xmath4 , merely for counting reasons .",
    "the number of elements of @xmath4 whose trees have @xmath6 carets is at least the order of @xmath65 ( due to the permutations ) , while the number of distinct elements of length @xmath6 can be at most exponential in @xmath6 in any group .",
    "the best possible bounds for the number of carets in terms of word length in the group @xmath4 is the following inequality proved by birget as theorem 3.8 @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath66 and these bounds are optimal , in a sense similar to that which will be made precise in section [ bounds ] .",
    "since the lower bounds on word length are linear in the number of carets in the case of @xmath4 we see that the standard inclusions @xmath67 are all quasi - isometric embeddings ; that is , @xmath2 is undistorted in @xmath3 , and @xmath3 is undistorted in @xmath4 .",
    "this property will be no longer true for inclusions in @xmath5 , as we will show in section [ distortion ] .    in this section we will prove the analog for @xmath5 to the inequality above :    [ logn - nlogn ] in the group @xmath5 , the word length of an element @xmath61 and number of carets @xmath63 in a minimal size tree - pair representative satisfy @xmath68 and the bounds can not be improved .",
    "_ proof : _ the upper bound is proven the standard way .",
    "we take a positive word @xmath47 , and according to proposition [ semi - normal form ] , write it as @xmath43 then , we rewrite each generator using the following relations : @xmath69 for all @xmath70 . since the conjugating element is always @xmath71 ,",
    "cancellations ensure that the length stays approximately the same .",
    "the bound @xmath72 appears because of the permutations , since @xmath72 is the diameter of @xmath73 with respect to the relevant transpositions .    for the lower bound",
    ", we note that if an element has @xmath15 carets , when it is multiplied by a generator , it is possible that the multiplication could have up to @xmath74 carets . if an element has , for instance , only horizontal subdivisions , when multiplied by @xmath75 , the number of subdivisions ( and hence the number of carets ) becomes @xmath74 , since each one of the previous subdivision is divided in four , as illustrated in figure [ log - bound ]     +    if each multiplication by a generator can multiply the number of carets by 4 , an element of length @xmath76 could have up to @xmath77 carets .",
    "other generators may increase word length by additive factors , but the worst case is exactly the increase by a factor of 4 .",
    "hence @xmath78 , so @xmath79 .",
    "first , we describe some properties of the lower bound for word length in terms of the number of carets .    the word length of an element of @xmath5 which is represented by a tree - pair diagram of depth @xmath1 is at least @xmath80    _ proof : _ right multiplying by a generator in the finite generating set can add most 3 levels to the tree - pair diagram .",
    "this happens in the case that we right - multiply an element @xmath81 with no right subtree in @xmath14 by any of @xmath82 or @xmath83 from the finite generating set .",
    "thus , any product of less than @xmath80 generators can not have depth @xmath1 .    from this",
    "it follows that the cyclic subgroups generated by any single generator from the @xmath26 or @xmath27 families are undistorted in @xmath5 , for example .",
    "as seen in the proof of theorem [ logn - nlogn ] , multiplying by a generator can increase the number of carets by a multiplicative factor .",
    "the powers of the element @xmath84 have exponentially many carets , in fact the minimal number of carets to represent @xmath85 is @xmath86 .",
    "we give further related specific examples later in section [ distortion ] .",
    "any of these examples show that the lower bound of theorem [ logn - nlogn ] is optimal .    to analyze the genericity of the upper bound in theorem [ logn - nlogn",
    "] , we use arguments analogous to those for @xmath4 .",
    "birget @xcite showed not only the @xmath87 upper bound on growth word length in @xmath4 with respect to the number of carets , but also that the fraction of elements close to this bound converges exponentially fast to 1 . in 2v , we note analogous behavior :    let @xmath88 be the set of elements of @xmath5 representable with @xmath1 carets and having no representatives with fewer than @xmath1 carets .",
    "the fraction of elements of @xmath88 which have word length greater than @xmath87 converges exponentially fast to 1 .",
    "_ proof : _ here we use a counting argument , analogous to that used by birget @xcite to count elements in @xmath4 . in @xmath5",
    ", we consider the subset of representatives of elements which have only horizontal subdivisions in the domain and only vertical subdivisions in the range .",
    "their tree - pair diagrams are guaranteed to be reduced and of minimal size by a straightforward argument .",
    "so to count the set of elements of this type of diagram size @xmath1 , we have @xmath28 choices ( where @xmath28 is the @xmath1-th catalan number ) for the first all - square tree of size @xmath1 and @xmath28 choices for the all - triangular tree of size @xmath1 , and @xmath89 choices for the permutation .",
    "this set of elements has size @xmath90 which is , by the stirling formula :    @xmath91    where the @xmath92 term goes to zero as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the number of elements of word length @xmath1 in any finitely generated group with respect to @xmath93 generators is no more than @xmath94 .",
    "thus we see that the ratio of elements that have word length less than @xmath95 out of elements that have tree - pair diagrams of size @xmath1 is less than @xmath96 which converges to 0 exponentially fast , as desired .",
    "so by complementing we have the result .",
    "elements of @xmath5 can be represented with pairs of binary trees , where the carets have been subdivided in two types .",
    "this fact makes it more difficult to multiply elements whose caret types disagree , illustrated already in theorem [ logn - nlogn ] , and the number of carets can grow faster because of this situation .",
    "this phenomenon has been described already by wladis in @xcite for the group @xmath97 , which has also carets of two types ( binary and ternary ) .",
    "this feature of @xmath5 implies now that the groups @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , when seen as subgroups of @xmath5 ( by doing only vertical subdivisions , for instance ) , are exponentially distorted .",
    "_ we consider the specific element @xmath98 , illustrated in figure [ expdist ] .",
    "this element lies in a copy of @xmath2 in @xmath5 obtained by putting @xmath2 into @xmath5 using only vertical subdivisions .",
    "the element @xmath85 has @xmath86 carets , as it is seen with an easy induction .",
    "its two trees are balanced trees of depth @xmath1 , one with only vertical subdivisions , and one with only horizontal subdivisions . by matching the horizontal subdivisions with the vertical ones in @xmath99 we obtain that the element @xmath98 has",
    "a number of carets of the order of @xmath86 , and all of them of vertical type , so the element is in @xmath2 .",
    "the element @xmath98 has length in @xmath4 no more than @xmath100 , but the number of carets is exponential in @xmath6 and thus its word length as an element of the vertical copy of @xmath2 in @xmath5 is also exponential ."
