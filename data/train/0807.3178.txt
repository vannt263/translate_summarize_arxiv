    "the classification of low dimensional complex associative algebras is one of the earliest classification theorems , dating to 1870 .",
    "the notion of deformations of associative algebras is more recent , and was thoroughly studied by murray gerstenhaber in the 1960 s .",
    "recently , the notion of moduli spaces of algebras of fixed dimension has appeared in the literature , which gives a new , more geometric view of the space of equivalence classes of algebras .",
    "the classification of the algebras refers only to the set of equivalence classes , and can be said to have been solved if representatives for all equivalence classes have been found and described in terms of some families and special elements .",
    "the main concern in the classification problem is to avoid duplicate listings .",
    "the moduli space problem is to give a description of these equivalence classes in terms of geometry .",
    "the set of all associative algebra structures is described by some homogenous quadratic polynomials on the structure constants , so these algebras determine an algebraic set .",
    "the group of automorphisms acts on the space of structure constants , and preserves this algebraic set .",
    "the moduli space is the quotient by this group action , and thus is not a variety , and as a topological space , is not hausdorff .    in this paper",
    ", we give a different interpretation of this moduli space , by decomposing the set of equivalence classes of associative algebras according to deformation theory .",
    "more specifically , the versal deformations of an element in this space give a picture of a local neighborhood of the element .",
    "from this local analysis , the authors were able to determine that for lie algebras at least up to dimension 4 ( see @xcite ) , a geometric picture emerges .",
    "even though the moduli space is not hausdorff , it has a stratification by orbifolds , which are connected by special types of deformations , called jump deformations , which capture all of the non - hausdorff behaviour of the moduli space .",
    "our primary aim in this paper was to examine whether the same phenomena applied to moduli spaces of associative algebras .",
    "as the results in this paper show , the moduli space of complex associative algebras of dimension 3 has a stratification of the same type observed for lie algebras .",
    "there are parallels and differences between the moduli spaces of complex lie algebras and associative algebras on a space of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for 2-dimensional spaces , all strata are singleton points , but in the case of associative algebras there are six such points , and there is only one complex lie algebra on a space of dimension 2 . in this paper",
    ", we shall show that on a 3-dimensional complex space , the moduli space of complex associative algebras consists of 22 different strata , of which 21 are singleton points , and one an orbifold modelled on the space @xmath1 . for the 3-dimensional lie algebra case , there were 4 strata , 3 of which were singleton points , and one given by the orbifold @xmath1 .",
    "complex associative algebras of dimension up to 5 were first classified by benjamin peirce as early as 1870 , originally in the form of a self - published text , which appeared later in @xcite .",
    "peirce s methodology was criticized by his son charles peirce , who pointed out that the quaternions can not be realized as a complex associative algebra , but are only a real algebra .",
    "it was charles peirce who first showed that the only division algebras over the reals are the real , complex and quaternionic algebras ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite , an analysis of peirce s method of construction of the complex asssociative algebras",
    "is given , and some of the problems with the presentation of the classification in @xcite are discussed .    since peirce",
    ", there are other classifications of 3 , 4 and 5 dimensional associative algebras , like of b.g .",
    "scorza , 1938 @xcite , p. gabriel @xcite and g. mazzola @xcite .",
    "they all use different from ours techniques , and we rather stayed at the original peirce s classification .",
    "the main issue , which we found to be problematic when we compared our classification with benjamin peirce s , is that he analyzes only those algebras which are called by him _ pure algebras _ , but does not give a definition of what he means by this concept .",
    "charles peirce , in footnotes added in publication , partially explains what is meant by a non - pure algebra ; more clarification is provided in @xcite .",
    "the fact remains that peirce did not classify the non - pure algebras , although we note that such a classification would not be difficult to achieve , so peirce s classification of the pure algebras does provide the key insight into the classification of complex associative algebras .",
    "the main technique introduced by benjamin peirce is his proof that every complex algebra either contains an idempotent element , defined as an element @xmath2 such that @xmath3 , or every element is nilpotent , that is @xmath4 , for some @xmath5 . from this observation alone , he obtains a classification of complex algebras up through dimension 5 , so it is a quite powerful tool .",
    "our approach to the classification problem is completely different from the existing approaches .",
    "we use versal deformations to analyze the moduli space , and decompose it into strata , determined by a decomposition in terms of smooth and jump deformations .",
    "this is a new approach to the study of moduli spaces of low dimensional algebras , which was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be a vector space over a field .",
    "then an associative algebra structure over  is given by a -linear map @xmath7 , in other words , an element of @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 is the space of @xmath10-cochains , then the space of cochains @xmath11 can be expressed as a direct product @xmath12 .    in @xcite ,",
    "a bracket operation , the _ gerstenhaber bracket _ on @xmath13 was introduced , which equips the space of cochains with the structure of a -graded lie algebra , where an element of @xmath14 is odd when @xmath10 is even and even otherwise .",
    "moreover @xmath15 is an element of @xmath16 , thus odd , and @xmath15 is an associative algebra structure precisely when @xmath17=0 $ ] .",
    "jim stasheff in @xcite realized that one could identify @xmath13 with the coderivations of the tensor coalgebra @xmath18 in a natural manner , and that the bracket of cochains corresponds to the usual bracket of coderivations .",
    "an odd coderivation @xmath15 satisfying @xmath17=0 $ ] is called a codifferential . thus associative algebra structures are simply codifferentials @xmath19 .",
    "two associative algebras , given by the codifferentials @xmath15 and @xmath20 , are isomorphic when the codifferentials are equivalent under the following action of @xmath21 on @xmath13 given as follows .",
    "any linear map @xmath22 induces a map @xmath23 by @xmath24 , which is bijective precisely when @xmath25 is invertible .",
    "then @xmath25 acts on @xmath26 by @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath20 are the two multiplication structures , then this definition of equivalence is the same as the usual notion of isomorphism , that is @xmath28 the set of equivalence classes of codifferentials in @xmath16 is called the moduli space of associative algebra structures on @xmath6 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the notion of _ hochschild cohomology _ of an associative algebra was defined .",
    "it is given by a map @xmath29 which maps @xmath14 to @xmath30 .",
    "gerstenhaber expressed this _",
    "hochschild coboundary operator _",
    "@xmath31 in terms of the gerstenhaber bracket , by @xmath32 $ ] . from this point of view",
    ", the fact that @xmath33 follows immediately from the codifferential property @xmath34=0 $ ] .    in a series of articles @xcite , gerstenhaber went on to use hochschild cohomology to study the deformation theory of associative algebras .",
    "a more general definition of deformation was given in @xcite , in terms of a base given by a local , augmented , commutative algebra @xmath35 .",
    "a local algebra is an algebra with a unique maximal ideal @xmath36 , and an augmentation is a morphism @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath35 is a local algebra with an augmentation , then the augmentation is unique , and is given by the map @xmath38 .",
    "we shall call the algebra @xmath35 infinitesimal if @xmath39=0 , and complete if @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath6 is a -vector space , then @xmath41 is a free @xmath35-module , the tensor coalgebra @xmath42 of @xmath43 over @xmath35 can be identified with @xmath44 , and the space of cochains @xmath45 can be identified with @xmath46 .",
    "( when @xmath35 is a complete local algebra , one uses @xmath47 and @xmath48 instead . ) note that the augmentation induces the structure of an @xmath35-module on any -vector space .",
    "a deformation of an associative algebra structure on @xmath6 with base @xmath35 is a codifferential @xmath49 on @xmath35-module @xmath50 , satisfying the following property .",
    "the map @xmath51 , given by @xmath52 must satisfy @xmath53 .",

    "if @xmath35 is infinitesimal , then the deformation is called an infinitesimal deformation , and if @xmath35 is complete , the deformation is called a formal deformation .",
    "this latter terminology comes from the fact that in the classical example of a 1-parameter formal deformation , the deformation is given as a formal power series in a parameter .",

    ", it was proven that there is a universal infinitesimal deformation for finite dimensional lie algebras , over a certain universal infinitesimal base .",
    "the proof for associative algebras is essentially the same .",
    "in general , there is no universal formal deformation , but there is a weaker notion of a versal deformation . in @xcite",
    "a general framework was established for proving the existence of a versal deformation , which was applied to lie algebras in @xcite .",
    "a construction of a versal deformation for lie algebras was given in @xcite , which carries over without any difficulties for associative algebras .",
    "a generalization of this construction to the case of infinity algebras appeared in @xcite .",
    "a versal deformation of an associative algebra given by the codifferential @xmath15 is a formal deformation @xmath49 of @xmath15 with base @xmath35 , such that if @xmath71 is a formal deformation of @xmath15 with base @xmath72 , then there is a morphism @xmath69 such that @xmath74 is _ formally equivalent _ to @xmath71 , where formal equivalence means equivalent as formal deformations with base @xmath72 . because the morphism @xmath75 is not in general , unique ,",
    "a versal deformation is not universal .",
    "the cohomology of a codifferential @xmath15 is @xmath76 , where @xmath31 is the hochschild coboundary operator determined by @xmath15 . since @xmath77",
    ", we have a natural stratification of the cohomology by spaces @xmath78 note that in deformation theory , we are only interested in calculating cohomology with coefficients in @xmath6 , so our notation refers to this notion .",
    "let @xmath79 be a prebasis of @xmath80 .",

    "in general , there will be second order terms in this bracket .",
    "however , it is easy to see that @xmath89 $ ] is a 3-cocycle , so if @xmath90 is a basis of @xmath91 and @xmath92 is a basis of the coboundaries @xmath93 , then @xmath94=a^{ij}_kt_it_j\\alpha^k+b^{ij}_kt_it_j\\beta^k.\\ ] ] now the @xmath95 for some 2-cochains @xmath96 , and if we consider the second order deformation @xmath97 , it is easy to see that in the bracket @xmath98 $ ] , the second order terms involving @xmath99 drop out , and third order terms are added to the bracket .",
    "the second order terms involving the @xmath100 do not drop out .",
    "therefore , we assume that the polynomials @xmath101 must be equal to zero , up to third order , so for a base of the second order deformation is given by @xmath102/(r^k,\\m^2)$ ] , where @xmath103 is the maximal ideal in @xmath102 $ ] . continuing in this fashion",
    ", we eventually arrive at an expression for the versal deformation @xmath104 where the @xmath105 are formal power series of order at least two in the parameters @xmath86 , and the @xmath106 are a prebasis of the 3-coboundaries , , a preimage in @xmath82 of a basis of @xmath107 . by order ,",
    "we mean the degree of the smallest term in the formal power series .",
    "we also obtain a series of relations @xmath108 , which are also given by formal power series of order at least two , one relation for each basis element in @xmath91 .",
    "thus the base of the formal deformations is @xmath102/(r_k)$ ] .",
    "note that the number of parameters @xmath105 is equal to the dimension of the 3-coboundaries , while the number of parameters @xmath86 is equal to the dimension of @xmath81 .",
    "this process of constructing the versal deformation order by order is quite tedious , although it often terminates rather quickly .",
    "however , the process may not terminate at all , so we have been using the following method of computing the versal deformation .",
    "we simply write the formula for the versal deformation above , with undetermined coefficients @xmath105 .",
    "consider the bracket @xmath89 $ ] , and project this to the space of 3-coboundaries .",
    "if the deformation is versal , this projection should be equal to zero .",
    "if @xmath109 , then we obtain @xmath110 quadratic polynomials in the @xmath110 variables @xmath105 , in terms of the parameters @xmath86 . in good cases",
    ", there should be a unique solution for the @xmath105 as functions of the parameters @xmath86 .",
    "next , the projection of @xmath89 $ ] onto @xmath91 , will give @xmath111 polynomials in the variables @xmath86 and @xmath105 , where @xmath112 . substituting the solutions for the @xmath105 into these polynomials",
    "give the @xmath111 relations on the base of the versal deformation .",
    "this gives the versal deformation and the relations on the base .",
    "note that the construction of the versal deformation depends on the choice of prebases for @xmath81 , @xmath91 , @xmath107 and @xmath113 as well as a choice of basis of @xmath107 .",
    "the relations on the base and the form of the versal deformation depend on these choices , so a lucky choice can greatly simplify the construction .",
    "now , how can we use the versal deformation to construct actual deformations , which are convergent formal power series ?",
    "if one is lucky , the relations will turn out to be rational functions of the parameters @xmath86 , and it will be possible to solve these relations to yield simple solutions .",
    "every such solution will determine a deformation of @xmath15 .",
    "some of the solutions are bounded away from the origin . in this case , we say that the solution is not local , because it is not defined for small values of the parameters . local solutions to the relations on the base determine how the codifferential deforms to other codifferentials .",
    "our method for constructing the moduli space as a geometric object is based on the idea that codifferentials which can be obtained by deformations with small parameters are `` close '' to each other . from the small deformations",
    ", we can construct 1-parameter families or even multi - parameter families , which are defined for small values of the parameter , except possibly when the parameters vanish .",
    "let us consider the 1-parameter case , since the multi - parameter case can be reduced to studying 1-parameter families .",
    "if @xmath60 is a one parameter family of deformations , then two things can occur .",
    "first , it may happen that for every small value of @xmath114 except zero @xmath60 is equivalent to a certain codifferential @xmath20 .",
    "then we say that @xmath60 is a jump deformation from @xmath15 to @xmath20 .",
    "it will never occur that @xmath20 is equivalent to @xmath15 , so there are no jump deformations from a codifferential to itself .",
    "otherwise , the codifferentials @xmath60 will all be nonequivalent if @xmath114 is small enough . in this case , we say that @xmath60 is a smooth deformation .    in @xcite",
    ", it was proved for lie algebras that if one has three codifferentials @xmath15 , @xmath20 and @xmath115 , and there are jump deformations from @xmath15 to @xmath20 and from @xmath20 to @xmath115 , then there is a jump deformation from @xmath15 to @xmath115 .",
    "similarly , if there is a jump deformation from @xmath15 to @xmath20 , and a family of smooth deformations @xmath116 , then there is a family @xmath60 of smooth deformations of @xmath15 , such that every deformation in the image of @xmath116 lies in the image of @xmath60 , for sufficiently small values of @xmath114 . in this case",
    ", we say that the smooth deformation of @xmath15 factors through the jump deformation to @xmath20 .    in the examples of complex moduli spaces of lie algebra which we have studied , it turns out that there is a natural stratification of the moduli space of @xmath0-dimensional lie algebras by orbifolds , where the codifferentials on a given strata are all connected by smooth deformations , which determine the local neighborhood structure .",
    "the strata are connected by jump deformations , in the sense that any smooth deformation from a codifferential on one strata to another strata factors through a jump deformation .",
    "moreover , all of the strata are given by projective orbifolds .",
    "in fact , in all the complex examples we have studied , the orbifolds either are single points , @xmath117 , @xmath118 or @xmath119 . for higher dimensional complex lie algebras ,",
    "we know that there are strata of the form @xmath120 in the moduli space of lie algebras of dimension @xmath121 .",
    "we do nt have any proof , but we conjecture that this pattern holds in general . in other words , we believe the following conjecture .    the moduli space of lie or associative algebras of a fixed finite dimension @xmath0 are stratified by projective orbifolds , with jump deformations and smooth deformations factoring through jump deformations providing the only deformations between the strata .",
    "extensions of algebraic structures have been studied and classified by many people , for example @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we gave a treatment of this old problem that is useful in constructing equivalence classes of extensions , because it uses cohomology as the primary tool in the construction , so is well adapted to our computational methods .",
    "we describe our approach to the extension problem below .",

    "generically , the dimension of @xmath91 is 3 , but for the special cases @xmath276 , @xmath277 , and @xmath267 the cohomology has dimension 5 , so these cases require separate treatment .",
