    ", there is an overall energy shift of the spectrum towards a hole doped state , but more importantly , the size of the energy gap also decreases .",
    "the reduced gap is a direct consequence of the impurity resonance from the potential scattering moving toward lower energies and effectively crowding out the gap .",
    "already for @xmath54 , a very realistic value for the potential scattering of a magnetic impurity atom ( see concluding remarks ) , there is a clear resonance peak visible in the low - energy spectrum and its tail has already started to fill up the energy gap .",
    "thus , we again see clearly how including a realistic potential scattering term lifts the magnetically induced gap and , as a consequence , the dos instead tends towards that of a potential impurity @xcite .",
    "this offers a simple explanation to recent experimental studies , which have found no significant difference between magnetic and non - magnetic surface impurities @xcite .",
    "we also note how the impurity resonance at intermediate @xmath3 values tends to split up in two peaks , a feature which has also been reported experimentally @xcite .",

    "[ fig - nk ] . ]",
    "the continuum model results demonstrate the importance of including the potential scattering contribution for magnetic impurities , since the resulting impurity resonance easily fills the magnetically induced gap .",
    "in fact , a realistic impurity can easily provide a potential scattering perturbation ( @xmath56  ev ) exceeding that of the bulk energy gap in a ti ( @xmath57  ev ) .",
    "this also raises the question if a continuum surface model , with an infinitely large bulk gap , accurately captures the low - energy properties of ti surface impurities .",
    "we therefore also study magnetic surface impurities with finite potential scattering in a full 3d lattice model .",
    "this lattice calculation excellently complements the continuum model , as it not only includes a finite bulk gap , but also captures the nonzero penetration of the surface states into the bulk of the ti .",
    "moreover , we only access the behavior of dirac delta impurities in the continuum model , whereas the lattice model naturally allows for non - singular impurities .",
    "more specifically , we use a simple tight - binding model of a ti , which consists of @xmath58-orbitals arranged on a diamond lattice @xcite : @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the annihilation operator on site @xmath61 in the lattice with spin - index @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the nearest neighbor hopping , @xmath64 is the spin - orbit coupling , @xmath65 is the cubic cell size , and @xmath66 are the two bond vectors connecting next - nearest neighbor sites @xmath61 and @xmath67 .",
    "this system becomes a strong ti with a single dirac surface cone when setting @xmath68 for one of the nearest neighbor directions not parallel to ( 111 ) @xcite . to access a surface ,",
    "we construct a slab in the ( 111 ) direction with abbcc ... aabbc stacking termination . to avoid a hybridization gap between the two slab surfaces , we use eight lateral unit cells , each consisting of six atomic layers . finally , we set @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which gives @xmath71 for the surface states , the same as in @xmath19 .",
    "( a ) and @xmath72 ( b ) . here",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 . ]    to study surface impurities , we create a rectangularly shaped surface supercell with @xmath75 sites in each direction , resulting in a surface area @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the unit of length .",
    "we then add @xmath78 to the hamiltonian , where @xmath79 is the total impurity scattering potential and @xmath80 is one specific surface lattice site within the supercell .",
    "we only consider single - site impurities , which model substitutional or on - top absorbed adatoms , as those most straightforwardly connects to the continuum model results .",
    "however , we do not expect any qualitative changes for extended defects .",
    "for the impurity , we include both potential and magnetic scattering : @xmath81 .",
    "the surface states in @xmath82 do not have as simple a spin structure as the continuum model @xmath19 , but we nonetheless find that a zeeman magnetic field along the @xmath83-direction develops a clear energy gap at the dirac point .",
    "we therefore use a total scattering potential @xmath84 to study the influence of potential scattering on the magnetic impurity induced gap .",
    "we solve @xmath85 in the supercell using exact diagonalization and use the eigenstates to calculate the local dos at each lattice site .",
    "we use a @xmath86 @xmath87-point grid to achieve a high energy resolution capable of accurately resolving small energy gaps and a 0.01 gaussian broadening to compensate for the finite system size .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : urun ] , we plot the local surface dos maximally away from a @xmath74 impurity in a @xmath73 supercell , corresponding to @xmath88 surface impurity concentration . at @xmath89 , we see a clear energy gap at the dirac point centered around the fermi level . slowly increasing @xmath3 moves the energy gap to slightly higher energies and , at the same time , very clear impurity resonance peaks start to appear at progressively lower energies .",
    "the latter causes the energy gap to shrink and it is completely filled already at @xmath90 . we especially note that the gap disappears already for small values of @xmath3 .",
    "this is very far from the unitary scattering limit , where the impurity resonance peak is firmly centered around the dirac point @xcite and then generates such a large amount of dos around the fermi level , that the system becomes prone to spontaneous magnetization through a stoner - like impurity mechanism @xcite .",
    "instead , the energy gap in fig .",
    "[ fig : urun ] disappears due to the tail of the impurity resonance peak adding spectral weight at the dirac point .",
    "we also note that the impurity resonance has a clear double - peak structure , which we here attribute to bonding and anti - bonding impurity bands . while we in fig .",
    "[ fig : urun ] plot the local dos far away from the impurity , the energy gap is a global property and does not change throughout the surface .",
    "the impurity resonances are naturally taller closer to the impurity , but we find that the peaks are non - dispersive , and thus their influence on the energy gap is the same both near and far away from the impurity .",
    "quite remarkably , all the results and trends with increasing strength of the potential scattering @xmath3 are very similar for the 3d lattice model in fig .",
    "[ fig : urun ] and the continuum surface model in fig .",
    "[ fig - nk ] .",
    "these include the energy gap shrinking and moving to higher energies , before finally disappearing for @xmath52 of the order of one , as well as the two - peaked impurity resonance structure .",
    "this is especially noteworthy since the lattice calculation has a bulk gap of only about @xmath91 and the impurity resonance state has been found to penetrate as deep as ten layers into the ti @xcite .    in order to explicitly track the influence of the potential scattering on the energy gap , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : extgap](a ) the extracted energy gap as function of @xmath3 for several different impurity concentrations and magnetic moments .     for supercell sizes @xmath75 and impurity magnetic moments @xmath92 . dashed line is for chemical potential @xmath93 . ]    clearly , the energy gap is larger for larger @xmath92 and higher impurity concentrations , as both generate an overall larger effective zeeman magnetic field .",
    "however , we find that the gap in all cases diminishes and is finally completely filled for very realistic strengths of the potential scattering associated with a magnetic impurity .",
    "this result is unaffected if we add a finite chemical potential @xmath94 to the hamiltonian @xmath82 ( dashed line ) .",
    "thus both intrinsic doping and local charge puddles @xcite will not affect the results , if anything , non - local effects from charge puddles have been proposed to further diminish the gap @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : extgap](b ) , we finally plot the position of the dirac point . there is a sub - linear increase in position of the dirac point with increasing @xmath3 , but , notably , the size of the magnetic moment does not influence the position of the dirac point . adding a finite @xmath94 simply shifts the dirac point an equivalent distance .",
    "finite concentration of magnetic impurities , where a zeeman magnetic field is produced as a collective effect @xcite , has been considered to be a promising pathway for gap opening and thus functionalizing the ti surface .",
    "we have here shown that by also including the potential scattering , present for all impurities , the magnetically induced gap can be completely filled .",
    "potential scattering in dirac materials is known to give rise to impurity resonances @xcite , and we find that the tail of their spectral weight easily fills up the energy gap .",
    "most strikingly , we find that the energy gap is completely filled for a ratio between the potential and magnetic scattering contributions as low as 1  10 , which is well within the range of expected values for the potential ( 1  10 ev ) and magnetic ( 0.1  1 ev ) scattering for magnetic dopants in tis .",
    "the remarkably close alignment between results from a continuum surface model and a 3d tight - binding lattice model makes it possible to rule out modeling deficiencies .",
    "our results therefore provide new crucial understanding and could offer to resolve the seemingly contradictory experimental situation as to if magnetic impurities induce an energy gap in the ti surface states ."
