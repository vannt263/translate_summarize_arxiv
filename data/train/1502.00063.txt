    "this work can be regarded as a continuation of some of the investigations initiated by the first author and saff in @xcite , where greedy energy sequences with respect to general kernels were introduced and many properties of these sequences were obtained .",
    "greedy energy sequences are defined in @xcite as follows .",

    "the function @xmath6 is referred to as the _ kernel_. given a compact set @xmath7 , a sequence @xmath8 is called a _ greedy @xmath6-energy sequence _ on @xmath9 if it is generated in the following way :    * the first point @xmath10 is selected arbitrarily on @xmath9 . * assuming that @xmath11 have been selected , @xmath12 is chosen to satisfy @xmath13 for every @xmath14 .",
    "the existence of a point @xmath12 satisfying follows from the lower semicontinuity of @xmath6 , but of course the choice of @xmath12 may not be unique in general . as in @xcite , we will use here the notation @xmath15 to denote the first @xmath1 points of the sequence @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 and we use the logarithmic kernel @xmath18 ( here and below @xmath19 indicates the euclidean distance between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , then the above algorithm generates the classical leja sequences on compact subsets of the complex plane . if @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the riesz @xmath0-kernel with parameter @xmath25 , then the sequences obtained are the greedy @xmath0-energy sequences on compact subsets of @xmath26 .",
    "the main interest for the study of greedy energy sequences in @xcite was to compare the asymptotic behavior of the configurations @xmath27 with the asymptotic behavior of optimal energy configurations .",
    "the study of the asymptotic properties of optimal energy configurations has been a leitmotif in the work of saff , and his efforts have produced a tremendous advancement in the theory of discrete minimal energy problems . in this work",
    "we will be referring frequently to optimal energy configurations and their asymptotic properties , so we define them next .    given a set @xmath28 of @xmath1 ( @xmath29 ) points in @xmath4 , not necessarily distinct , we write @xmath30 and we define the _ discrete energy _ of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath6 by @xmath32 now assume that @xmath7 is a compact set and @xmath29 is an integer .",

    "note that the existence of optimal energy configurations is guaranteed by the lower semicontinuity of @xmath6 .",
    "part of the results in @xcite were obtained in the context of the unit circle @xmath36 and the riesz @xmath0-kernel .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in terms of first - order asymptotics , there is a difference in the behavior of greedy @xmath0-energy sequences and optimal @xmath1-point configurations when @xmath37 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.6 ) ) which is not present in the case @xmath38 . moreover , this difference takes place in the more general context of rectifiable jordan arcs or curves , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "it was also shown in @xcite that on @xmath36 and in the case @xmath39 , the second - order asymptotic behavior of greedy @xmath0-energy sequences is no longer the same as that of optimal @xmath1-point configurations ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* propositions 2.4 and 2.7 ) ) .",
    "these differences will be explained in detail below .    in this paper",
    "we investigate more deeply the asymptotic behavior of leja sequences and greedy @xmath0-energy sequences on @xmath36 from the energy point of view .",
    "consequently we are able to refine some of the results in @xcite mentioned above .",
    "we first describe the results we obtain for leja sequences and later for greedy @xmath0-energy sequences .",
    "the results we obtain have also motivated some conjectures for general sequences on @xmath36 that we state in section  [ section : conjectures ] .",
    "recall that a leja sequence @xmath16 on an infinite compact set @xmath40 is a sequence that is constructed by choosing an arbitrary @xmath41 , and selecting each subsequent @xmath42 such that @xmath43 equivalently , for every @xmath14 , @xmath12 maximizes the product @xmath44 on @xmath45 .",
    "leja sequences are named after f. leja in recognition of his work @xcite , although they were first introduced by a. edrei in @xcite .",
    "these sequences have attracted some interest in recent years , especially concerning the study of their interpolation properties , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "not many works have been devoted to the study of the energy and distribution of leja sequences ; some of these are @xcite .    given a configuration @xmath28 of @xmath29 distinct points in the complex plane @xmath46",

    "firstly , it is clear that a rotation ( by multiplication with @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) will neither destroy the leja sequence property nor change the logarithmic energy of the configurations @xmath27 .",
