    "there are notoriously few fully analyzable models of non trivial ( interacting ) current carrying systems @xcite in non - equilibrium steady states ( ness ) .",
    "the few exceptions are almost all one dimensional lattice gases evolving according to stochatic jump processes and interacting via exclusions , in contact with particle reservoirs at different densities . among the simplest of such models",

    "the stationary state satisfies detailed balance . for reservoirs at unequal densities , say @xmath3 on the left and @xmath4 on the right ( @xmath5 ) , the matrix method gives a full microscopic description of the ness including the explicit form of the correlation functions @xmath6 @xcite and allows one to calculate the large deviation function ( ldf ) in the hydrodynamical scaling limit , @xmath7 , @xmath8 $ ] @xcite .",
    "one can also obtain , in this scaling limit ( with diffusively scaled time ) , the time evolution of the system in a non stationary state via a diffusion equation for typical density profiles as well as the ldf for time evolving densities and currents @xcite .    in attempts to further extend our understanding of such non - equilibrium systems ,",
    "we investigate here the stationary state of a system of @xmath9 particles on a ring of @xmath0 sites with exclusion .",
    "the jump rates to the right and left ( counter clockwise , clockwise ) for a particle at site @xmath10 are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "we shall be interested , as usual , in the case @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "we consider two types of situations :    1 .",
    "the `` battery '' case : the system evolves according to the ssep except that there is a `` battery '' at bond @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   the smooth asymmetric case ( wasep ) @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 a smooth field of period 1 .",
    "( combination of both cases can also be treated ) .    in the first case ,",
    "the microscopic `` battery '' at @xmath16 induces a ness with a particle current of magnitude proportional to @xmath27 and a concomitant linear density profile .",
    "this looks very similar to what happens in the open system and would suggest that the measures for the reservoirs and battery driven systems would be similar when @xmath14 , in the same spirit as the difference between `` canonical '' and `` grand - canonical '' nature of the two systems disappears in equilibrium , when @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this is indeed the case to the leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "local equilibrium holds in both models and implies that both steady state statistics are given locally by a product bernoulli measure .",
    "here , we will focus on the corrections to this local bernoulli measure and on the long range correlations .",
    "we will see that the two ness measures differ much more than the corresponding equilibrium ones .",
    "the complicated interplay between the non - equilibrium long - range correlations , the canonical constraint and the driving mechanism leads to two - point correlation functions with different structure for the reservoir and battery driven systems .",
    "in particular , the long range correlations are much more singular for the battery model than those in the open system .",
    "a variant of this model with a macroscopic battery was introduced in @xcite and a related dynamics with colliding hard spheres was also considered in @xcite .    in the second case , the macroscopic stationary density profile @xmath30 then satisfies the general equation for driven diffusive systems @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the stationary current which is independent of @xmath33 .",
    "equation corresponds to the stationary solution of the diffusion equation with a drift @xmath34 the first case can be thought of as a very singular limit of the second one when @xmath35 becomes a @xmath36-function localized at the origin .",
    "we will also consider the zero range process ( zrp ) driven by a `` battery '' .",
    "this microscopic dynamics is simpler than the ssep driven by a battery , as the ness of the zrp on the ring is a product measure constrained to having a fixed number of particles .",
    "there are no long range correlations in the non - equilibrium measure of the zrp with reservoirs @xcite and the long range correlations of the zrp driven by a battery are similar to those found for an equilibrium system with the constraint that the total particle number is fixed .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : the models ] , we define the microscopic models . by using a macroscopic approach ,",
    "the two - point correlation functions are computed for the battery model in section [ sec : macroscopic approach ] and for a slowly varying field in section [ sec : the macroscopic approach for the slowly varying field ] .",
    "these results are then compared , in section [ sec : comparison with the open system and with numerical simulations ] , to the two - point correlation functions of an open system in contact with reservoirs .",
    "finally the invariant measure of the zrp driven by a battery is computed in section [ sec : exactly solvable models ] .",
    "some technical details concerning the solution of the macroscopic equations are given in the appendices .",
    "we consider the ssep on the ring @xmath37 containing @xmath9 particles with jump rates @xmath2 to the left and to the right except at the bond @xmath16 where the jump rate from @xmath0 to @xmath2 is @xmath22 and from @xmath2 to @xmath0 is @xmath23 .",
    "these modified asymmetric rates act as a battery which forces a current of particles through the system .",
    "we assume that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    in the absence of the battery ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the stationary state is one in which all the @xmath41 configurations have equal weight . for @xmath7 , @xmath42 ,",
    "this corresponds locally to a product bernoulli measure with density @xmath43 . denoting by @xmath44 the bernoulli measure at site @xmath10 with density @xmath43 , the product measure @xmath45 is invariant wrt the ssep dynamics for any constant density @xmath43 .    for the ssep on @xmath46 with a battery at the bond @xmath47 ,",
    "the invariant measure remains a product but the density is discontinuous across the battery .",
    "the invariant measures on @xmath46 are @xmath48 where the densities @xmath49 ( at sites @xmath50 and @xmath2 ) satisfy the equation @xmath51 these measures satisfy detailed balance and there is no current flowing in the system .    on the ring",
    "when @xmath52 , the steady state measure is not known .",
    "taking averages with respect to the time evolving measure @xmath53 , we obtain @xmath54 it follows immediately that in the stationary state , the average density profile is linear @xmath55 where @xmath56 stands for the stationary measure and the mean density @xmath57 satisfies @xmath58 there is also a stationary average current @xmath59 of order @xmath27 @xmath60 and one has the identity @xmath61 for finite @xmath0 , the relations and do not allow to determine the average profile @xmath62 as involves the correlation between sites @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "if one assumes however that local equilibrium holds for large @xmath0 then the system will behave at the battery as if it was described by the measure .",
    "thus one expects that for large @xmath0 @xmath63 with @xmath64 satisfying @xmath65 where we used and .",
    "this implies that in terms of the macroscopic variable @xmath66 , that the steady state density @xmath30 is linear with a discontinuity at the battery @xmath67    the local equilibrium can be justified @xcite and one can prove that after space / time rescaling , the microscopic equations lead to a macroscopic description of the local density by the heat equation . the battery yields non - linear boundary conditions @xmath680,1 [ , \\qquad \\begin{cases } \\partial_t { \\rho}(t , x ) = \\partial_x^2 { \\rho}(t , x)\\\\ p \\ ; { \\rho}(t,1 ) \\big ( 1-{\\rho}(t,0 ) \\big ) = q \\ ; { \\rho}(t,0 ) \\big ( 1- { \\rho}(t,1 ) \\big)\\\\ \\partial_x { \\rho}(t,0 )   = \\partial_x { \\rho}(t,1 ) \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 stands for the local density at the macroscopic time @xmath70 and position @xmath33 .",

    "the effect of the battery should be understood as a force which maintains a fixed difference of chemical potentials across the origin .      in section [ sec : zero range process ] , we will study the invariant measure of a zrp driven by a battery .",
