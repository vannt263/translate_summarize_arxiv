    "magnetic fields are present in most astrophysical systems @xcite , but their origin is still unknown .",
    "spiral galaxies typically contain magnetic fields of about @xmath2 g that are aligned with the spiral density waves @xcite .",
    "a plausible explanation is that these fields have been produced from the exponential amplification of an initially weak field by a mean - field dynamo @xcite , in which a seed - field was amplified by the differential rotation of the galaxy in conjunction with magnetohydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "magnetic fields of comparable amplitude are also found on cluster scales @xcite .    the seed - field strength required at the time of completed galaxy formation for a galactic dynamo to produce the present magnetic field strength of a few @xmath3 g",
    "is usually quoted in the range @xmath4  @xcite . these estimates , though , are obtained by considering the dynamo amplification in a flat universe with zero cosmological constant for `` typical '' values of the parameters of the @xmath5dynamo . according to ref .",
    "@xcite these lower bounds can be relaxed to about @xmath6 g , for a universe with a dark energy component ( e.g. a cosmological constant or quintessence ) , which appears to be favored by recent results from high - redshift supernovae observations , cosmic microwave background experiments and large  scale structure data .    most proposed models of primordial seed - field generation either fail to meet these requirements or invoke non - standard coupling between the electromagnetic field and the inflaton scalar sector responsible for a primordial period of accelerated universe expansion ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the most economic and conservative physical mechanism for producing such a seed - field was proposed by harrison @xcite .",
    "the mechanism relies on the fact that weak magnetic fields are generated during the radiation era in regions that have non - vanishing vorticity .",
    "the main problem with harrison s mechanism is that the required vorticity of the plasma does not have any dynamical origin , but has to be put in by hand , as an initial condition . in this paper",
    "we show that rotational velocity of the plasma is unavoidably induced gravitationally by the nonlinear mode - mode coupling of primordial density perturbations generated during inflation , arising at second order in perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , we predict that a minimal seed magnetic field is generated by the differential rotational velocity of ions and electrons .",
    "the resulting magnetic field power - spectrum is fully determined by the amplitude and the spectral index @xmath7 of primordial scalar perturbations .",
    "the _ rms _ amplitude of the seed - field at recombination is @xmath8 g , on comoving scales @xmath9 mpc .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly recall harrison s mechanism and we show how the seed magnetic field is produced . in section iii",
    "we compute the power - spectrum of such a seed - field in terms of the power - spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations generated during inflation . finally , in section iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "let us first recall how harrison s mechanism @xcite works . consider a rotating region in the expanding early universe ( with scale factor @xmath10 ) , consisting of matter ( mostly protons ) with average energy density @xmath11 , electrons and photons with energy density @xmath12 .",
    "electrons and photons are tightly coupled and are considered as a single fluid in ref .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be their angular velocities . in absence of interactions ,",
    "their angular momenta , proportional respectively to @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , are separately conserved ( see also appendix [ kelvin ] ) .",
    "as the universe expands , they scale differently , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ". ions and the electron - photon fluid spin down at different rates and then currents and magnetic fields are generated .    a formal derivation of the resulting magnetic field strength in terms of the vorticity in the proton fluid including the electron - proton coupling can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to consider the evolution of the multicomponent fluid formed by photons , electrons and protons during the radiation era . at temperatures @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the electron mass ) ,",
    "the interactions between ions and electrons are strong due to copious lepton - pair production , and they are locked together .",
    "the interaction between electrons and photons is also very strong .",
    "this means that all the plasma has the same angular velocity at @xmath21 and no magnetic field can be generated .",
    "below this temperature , electrons and photons are still tightly coupled through thomson scattering . protons and electrons",
    "are tightly coupled through coulomb scattering ( scattering between photons and protons can be neglected as the coupling is weaker ) and so the photon fluid drags the protons in its motion .",
    "the difference in the strength of these interactions and in the mass of electrons and protons leads however to a small difference in the electron and proton fluid rotational velocities , that gives rise to non - vanishing currents and magnetic fields . in our case",
    "the rotational velocity of the plasma is sourced by the non - linear evolution of scalar ( density ) perturbations .",
    "the generation of the magnetic field ends at recombination , when electrons and protons combine to form neutral hydrogen and radiation decouples from matter .",
    "this means that the generation of the magnetic field starts around @xmath22 and ends when @xmath23 .",
    "dark energy and neutrinos can be ignored throughout the evolution . moreover , during the radiation era we can safely neglect the role of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) component , that is , we consider a plasma with only baryons ( protons ) , electrons and photons , and electromagnetic ( em ) fields .",
    "after matter - radiation equality , cdm plays the dominant gravitational role and it enters our equations determining the evolution of perturbations .    let us now go into the details of this mechanism . the momentum equation for the interacting components",
    "can be written using the total energy - momentum conservation equation @xmath24 the energy - momentum tensor of each component is not conserved independently and its divergence has a source term that takes into account the energy and momentum transfer among the components , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "we will describe the proton , electron and photon components as approximately perfect fluids , thus their energy momentum tensor can be written as @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we can expand the energy density and four velocity of each component as : @xmath30 in what follows we will neglect the electron and proton pressure , i.e. we set @xmath31 , while for the photons we have @xmath32 .",
    "the crucial step in our computation is that we have to include second - order terms in the metric and the matter perturbations @xcite , since rotational component of the velocity , and hence magnetic field , are only generated at second order .",
    "indeed linear vector modes are not generated during inflation and , by kelvin s circulation theorem vorticity is conserved for a perfect fluid .",
    "of course , this conservation holds at second order as well , and it applies to the vorticity of the fluid which generates the gravitational field . as explained in detail in appendix [ kelvin ] , this conservation law does not prevent the occurrence of a rotational velocity component of the charged particles , thus giving rise to a non - zero magnetic field .",
    "let us expand @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the superscripts @xmath35 and @xmath36 indicate first and second - order perturbation quantities .",
    "we will work in the poisson gauge , which is the generalization of the so - called longitudinal ( or newtonian ) gauge when vector and tensor modes are allowed .",

    "the vector perturbation is @xmath39 , and we will assume that it is not generated at first order @xmath40 .",
    "we will also neglect primordial tensor modes .",
    "although first order primordial vector and tensor modes are absent , the non - linear evolution of the primordial scalar perturbations gives rise to non - vanishing vector and tensor perturbations ( and corrections to the scalar perturbations ) at second order , @xmath41 and @xmath42@xcite .",
    "let us consider the momentum continuity equation for each fluid component ( whose general expression up to second order in perturbation theory is reported in appendix [ kelvin ] ) .",
    "the contribution of the electromagnetic field can be included in the source of the charged fluid components , as @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , where we have assumed charge neutrality ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the momentum equation for photons up to second order can be written as @xmath46 and for protons @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the expansion rate in conformal time .",
    "the momentum equation for electrons is similar to that for protons , but it has the opposite sign in the righ - hand side terms and an additional source , @xmath49 , due to the momentum transfer between the electron and photon fluids .",
    "this momentum transfer is due to thomson scattering and is given by @xmath50 , where the differential optical depth is @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the thomson cross section .",
    "the momentum transfer between electrons and protons is due to coulomb scattering and can be written as @xmath53 , where the collision time between electrons and protons is @xmath54 in terms of the conductivity of the plasma @xmath55 .    during the whole period we are interested in , up to the time of hydrogen recombination ,",
    "the collision time between electrons and photons ( @xmath56 ) and the electron - proton one are much shorter than the universe expansion time , thus momentum transfer is very efficient .",
    "a tight coupling expansion of the momentum equations gives , to lowest order , @xmath57 .",
    "we can obtain an equation for the vorticity of the proton fluid by taking the curl of eq .",

    "note also that in the case of pure matter it is possible to show that the conserved vorticity vector is @xmath168 ( see ref .",

    "we may consider first , as an illustration , the case of a non - interacting matter component .",
