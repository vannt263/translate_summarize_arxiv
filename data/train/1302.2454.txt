    "quasi - one dimensional organic salts formed from tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene ( tmttf ) molecules - also known as fabre charge - transfer ( ct ) salts - have been intensively investigated in the last two decades since they exhibit a rich variety of phases like antiferromagnetism , superconductivity , charge ordering , spin - density wave ordering or spin - peierls behavior .",
    "@xcite such phases can be driven both by external ( physical ) pressure as well as by chemical pressure ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediagram ] ) . even though a few successful models have been proposed for the description of these systems ,",
    "constructing a consistent microscopic picture of the relationships between the various phases remains a challenge.@xcite    clo@xmath2 is not well known . in the phase",
    "diagram its approximate position has been indicated with a dashed arrow .",
    "the possible phases are charge ordered ( co ) , mott insulating ( mi ) , antiferromagnetic ( af ) , spin peierls ( sp ) , spin density wave ( sdw ) , superconducting ( sc ) and 1d , 2d or 3d metal . ]",
    "the primary avenue of the present work is to understand the microscopic origin of the close competition between the different phases in these compounds as a function of chemical and external pressure as well as temperature .",
    "for that , we performed _",
    "ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite and model hamiltonian calculations for several fabre ct salts whose crystal structures were determined at different temperatures and pressure and investigated variations of their electronic properties with temperature and pressure.[multiblock footnote omitted ] by computing the real - space overlaps of wannier orbitals for the bands near the fermi level , we parametrize a two - band tight - binding hamiltonian model for the various systems and examine the differences in their electronic hopping parameters . in this way , we can connect structural and chemical modifications with changes in the electronic properties .",
    "furthermore , in order to analyze some of the preferred orderings we consider a description of the fabre ct salts in terms of an extended hubbard hamiltonian including on - site and inter - site coulomb interaction terms .",
    "the kinetic part of this model is given by the computed hopping parameters for the various compounds .",
    "we discuss spin - spin and charge - charge correlation properties by diagonalizing the model .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "sections  [ secii ] and [ seciii ] are dedicated to the description of the computational details as well as the crystal structure of the fabre ct salts . in sections",
    "[ seciv ] , [ secv ] and [ secvi ] we present , respectively , our results on the electronic structure , tight - binding models as well as extended hubbard models for a few members of fabre ct salts .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in sections  [ secvii ] and [ secviii ] .",
    "the electronic structure calculations presented here were performed in an all - electron full - potential local orbital basis using the fplo package.@xcite the densities were converged on an @xmath3 @xmath4 mesh , using a generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functional.@xcite    for materials without published hydrogen coordinates , hydrogen atoms were placed according to the expected bond lengths and angles of a methyl group ( c  h distance 1.1  , c  c  h angle 109@xmath5 ) . with the bond length and angle fixed , one has the freedom to choose the rotation angle of the set of hydrogen atoms on each methyl group around the c  c bond .",
    "we chose this angle such that one hydrogen is as far out of the plane of the molecule as possible .",
    "we tested the effect of this choice on the band structure and found no contribution to the bands of interest near the fermi level since in this energy region only tmttf bands of @xmath6 origin are involved .",
    "some of the structures had suspicious bond lengths and angles , therefore the atomic coordinates were relaxed with dft using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp , version 5.2.11 ) ,  @xcite with a projector - augmented wave basis .",
    "@xcite we used the gga functional,@xcite and included van der waals corrections  @xcite for the relaxations .",
    "we performed two kinds of relaxations ; in one relaxation we kept sulfur and the heavy anion atoms coordinates fixed , and in the other relaxation all atom positions were relaxed .",
    "the differences between the two relaxed structures were minimal .",
    "the atomic coordinates were converged to an energy difference of 1 mev on a @xmath7 @xmath4-mesh , with a plane wave cutoff energy of 500 ev .",
    "the tight - binding parameters were obtained by constructing wannier orbitals for the tmttf bands at the fermi level and computing real - space overlaps , as implemented in fplo .",
    "another way to generate these parameters is to fit the band structure of the model hamiltonian to the dft bands .",
    "the latter method can become difficult when many hopping parameters need to be fitted ; there can be a number of solutions which reproduce the dft bands equally well , but differ in physical details ( such as relative strengths of certain bonds ) . by using wannier orbital overlaps we can be sure that our parameter values have a clear physical interpretation .",
    "the exact diagonalization of the extended hubbard model was performed by considering system sizes of @xmath8 tmttf sites with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the fabre ct salts consist of alternate layers of tmttf molecules ( cations ) and monovalent anions , stacked in the @xmath9 direction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tmttfcrystal ] ) . in between the cation layers ,",
    "the planar tmttf molecules form @xmath6-stacked one dimensional chains in the @xmath10 direction with a slight ` zig - zag ' arrangement .",
    "there is a charge transfer of one electron from each ( tmttf)@xmath0 dimer to each anion , _",
    "i.e. _ the tmttf molecules carry half a hole on average .",
    "there are two classes of anions : those that conform to the @xmath11 symmetry of the tmttf part of the crystal ( such as pf@xmath1 ) , and those that break that symmetry ( such as clo@xmath2 ) . also , the anion species influence the proportions of the unit cell , as well as the intra- and inter - chain hopping strengths .",
    "the inter - chain hopping strengths are not only determined by the distance between the tmttf molecules , but also by changes in their zig - zag arrangement ( that is to say , how far away from a perfectly aligned stack they are , and in what direction ) .     plane .",
    "the organic molecules form @xmath6-stacked 1d chains along the crystal @xmath10 direction ( with a slight zig - zag pattern ) , and form layers parallel to the @xmath12 plane .",
    "these organic layers alternate with anion layers ( with the anions centered on the pink as sites ) stacked in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "grey atoms are carbon , yellow are sulfur , while hydrogen atoms are shown in white . ]",
    "tmttf molecules within a chain show a slight dimerization along the chain .",
    "we can quantify this structural dimerization as the difference between the larger dimerization distance of adjacent tmttf molecules , @xmath13 , and the shorter dimerization distance , @xmath14 , normalized by the sum of the two distances : @xmath15 these distances are defined as the distances between the centres of mass of the c and s atoms in each tmttf molecule .",
    "table  [ tab : properties ] shows the structural dimerization of the materials investigated in this work .",
    "this table also includes the electronic dimerization , which is introduced in sec .",
    "v. in general , the structural dimerization increases slightly with increasing temperature .",
    "cooling from room temperature to t = 4 k , ( tmttf)@xmath0asf@xmath1 and ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 both show charge ordering phase transitions and spin - peierls transitions .",
    "these ordering transitions are not visible in the crystal structures ; there are no significant changes in the structural dimerization from t= 300 k to t= 4 k. ( tmttf)@xmath0sbf@xmath1 shows similar changes in the structural dimerization between 100 k and room temperature , and does not go through any ordering transitions in this range .",
    ".structural and electronic dimerization of the fabre ct salts considered in the present work .",
    "the structural dimerization of the tmttf molecules is defined in eq .  , and the electronic dimerization is defined in eq .   in sec",
    ". v. references marked with * have no ( or unrealistic ) published hydrogen coordinates .",
    "note that clo@xmath2 and bf@xmath2 are tetrahedral anions , and so do not conform to the reported @xmath11 symmetry ( the anions do not have the required inversion symmetry ) .",
    "the anion ordering transition only occurs in these systems where the anion does not have inversion symmetry .",
    "the change in sign of @xmath16 indicates that the shorter bond has the smaller @xmath17 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
