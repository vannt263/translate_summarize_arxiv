    "both the astronomy department and the planetary sciences department at the university of arizona , known as steward observatory ( so ) and the lunar and planetary laboratory ( lpl ) respectively , have enjoyed scientific success over the past @xmath0 years . in more recent times however , so has experienced a serious decline in the quality of its graduate students and their education , thus leading to the inevitable conclusion that lpl is the far greater institution for the production of scientifically useful dotoral candidates .",
    "a competitive volleyball tournament was held during 2001 between graduate participants from both lpl and so .",
    "the match terminated in a rout of epic proportion .",
    "steward graduate students were so humiliated so as not to ever return to the game of volleyball .",
    "we quit cuz we got bored .        _",
    "_ d__epartmental coolness as a function of time over the last decade for both lpl and steward observatory .",
    "the y - axis is measured in coolombs .",
    "particularly note the divergence in coolness values between the two institutions in 1998  this is believed to be the result of the defection of terry hurford from so to lpl at that time .",
    "in addition , the above facts are buttressed by the extreme and total humiliation that astronomy department graduate students suffered at the hands of the planetary science grads on april 1 , 2001 ( bieging , private communication ) .",
    "on that date the steward observatory email list was informed of the impending annexation of their department by the lunar and planetary laboratory due to budget constraints , and signs attesting to this new status were emplaced around the building .",
    "so infinitessimal are / were the intellectual and technical capabilities of so graduate students that not only did one of these signs remain in position for over 1 week , but that in fact no counter - pranks have been executed for the past 1 year .",
    "we argue that these events imply the complete subordination of so grads to the will of the lpl graduate population ."
