    "the discovery of the top quark in @xmath5 collisions @xcite was a milestone for the standard model . the next steps beyond that milestone will be to improve the measurement of the top mass , and to test our understanding of qcd further by studying the details of its production and decay .",
    "we focus here on the `` single - lepton '' channel defined by @xmath6 with one top decaying hadronically ( @xmath7 , or its charge conjugate ) and the other decaying leptonically ( @xmath8 , or its charge conjugate , with @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) .",
    "this channel is experimentally favorable because the high @xmath11 lepton and large missing @xmath11 due to the neutrino provide a clean event signature that naturally discriminates against backgrounds .",
    "we will concentrate on the hadronically decaying top , since the treatment of the leptonically decaying one is complicated by errors in the measurement of the transverse momentum of the neutrino , via missing @xmath11 , and by ambiguity in its longitudinal momentum .",
    "we will not deal here with the question of how @xmath4 events are to be identified @xcite .",
    "rather we will concentrate on the problem of measuring @xmath12 once the events have been isolated .",
    "the mass determination relies on measuring the energies and directions of jets , and inferring from them the energies and directions of the original quarks .",
    "in addition to instrumental calibrations , this requires corrections for the hard - scale branching of partons , and for non - perturbative hadronization effects .",
    "these hard and soft qcd effects can be modeled by event generators such as herwig @xcite , which have been shown to describe the appropriate physics in @xmath13 decay at the @xmath14 collider lep @xcite , where the original @xmath15 energy is precisely known .",
    "part of the top quark analysis involves measuring the mass of the hadronically decaying @xmath2 boson .",
    "an eventual goal of the analysis should be to confirm the qcd effects in @xmath2 decay that are similar to those seen in great detail for @xmath13 decay . in the meantime",
    ", we can assume that the qcd effects are understood , and use the @xmath2 mass for help in determining the correct jet assignments in @xmath4 events .",
    "the decay @xmath16 is also a potentially useful tool to calibrate the detector , since the decay jets probe the detector at a wide range of angles and jet transverse momenta , and the @xmath2 mass is accurately known @xcite .",
    "this calibration is unavailable outside of top quark events , because hadronic @xmath2 decays are generally obscured by large qcd backgrounds @xcite .",
    "we will investigate two ideas that might improve the mass resolution .",
    "the first idea , examined in sect .",
    "[ sec : cones ] , is to use fixed cones in the rest frames of the decaying @xmath1 and @xmath2 to define the jets , in place of the usual cones defined in the rest frame of the detector .",
    "the second idea , examined in sect .",
    "[ sec : angles ] , is to use the angles between jets in the @xmath1 rest frame to measure @xmath3 directly .",
    "the first idea that we will investigate can be understood most clearly by considering the @xmath2 mass measurement . since the @xmath2 is color neutral , its decay products have nothing to do with other jets present in the final state . in the rest frame of the @xmath2",
    ", the decays will look very similar to the @xmath13 decays studied at lep .",
    "they will almost always appear as back - to - back jets that can be defined by two fixed cones of half - angle @xmath17 oriented in opposite directions .",
    "reasonable cone sizes are on the order of @xmath18 .",
    "cones of this size are large enough to contain a good fraction of the energies of the jets , which are broadened by the collinear radiation singularity of qcd ; while they are small enough to leave a large fraction @xmath19 of the full @xmath20 of solid angle outside the two cones , so not too much `` background '' is included in them .",
    "although cone algorithms are not the traditional jet definitions in @xmath14 physics , they have been shown to work there , and even to provide superior resolution in jet angle and energy @xcite .",
    "this proposal to try fixed cones in the @xmath2 rest frame is quite different from the current experimental procedure for top analysis , where jets are defined by cones @xmath21 in the lego variables of the detector .",
    "those variables , @xmath22 pseudorapidity and @xmath23 azimuthal angle , are lorentz invariant only under boosts along the beam direction . meanwhile",
    ", the @xmath2 can have a rather large component of boost transverse to the beam .",
    "for example , in @xmath4 events with typical acceptance cuts , the middle @xmath24 of the @xmath2 transverse momentum distribution extends from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , so @xmath27 is not small compared to @xmath28 .",
    "lego - defined jet cones therefore correspond to a wide variety of sizes and shapes of `` cone '' in the @xmath2 rest frame , depending on the boost and hence depending on details that have nothing to do with the @xmath2 decay .",
    "similarly , the jet cone for the @xmath29-quark jet from @xmath30 is most reasonably defined by a fixed angle in the @xmath1 rest frame .",
    "since the @xmath29 carries color , the argument for a cylindrically symmetric cone in this frame is weaker than in the case of the @xmath2 decay .",
    "but the @xmath1 rest frame is nevertheless at least more logical than using the rest frame of the detector",
    ".    it would similarly be reasonable to define the jet cone for the other @xmath29-jet , from the semileptonically decaying top , in the rest frame of that top .",
    "that should be done when this method is applied to real data .",
    "but we ignore it for the moment , in order to avoid bringing in the issue of how to estimate the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino , which is needed to find that frame .",
    "the idea of using fixed cones in the decay rest frames to define the jets is easy to implement as a follow - on to the traditional top quark analysis with `` kinematic reconstruction '' @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , with explicit matching of the observed jets to decay partons .",
    "the procedure for each event is :    1 .",
    "identify the four - momenta of the jets corresponding to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 come from @xmath2 decay and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are @xmath29-quark jets , by the usual procedures of cdf or d .",
    "@xmath37-jet tagging is helpful for this , but not essential .",
    "there may of course be additional jets observed in the event .",
    "2 .   define @xmath38 and @xmath39 to be four - momenta directed in the forward and backward beam directions : @xmath40 and @xmath41 for beams in the @xmath42-direction .",
    "3 .   redefine the 4-momentum of @xmath33 as the sum of the 4-momenta observed in the calorimeter detector in all cells ( `` towers '' ) that lie within @xmath17 of the old @xmath33 in the rest frame of the old @xmath43 .",
    "however , do not include cells that lie closer in angle to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath38 , or @xmath39 than to @xmath33 .",
    "+ similarly redefine the 4-momentum of @xmath34 as the sum of the 4-momenta of all cells that lie within @xmath17 of the old @xmath34 in the rest frame of the old @xmath43 , and are not closer in angle to @xmath33 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath38 , or @xmath39 .",
    "+ similarly redefine the 4-momentum of @xmath35 as the sum of the 4-momenta in cells that lie within @xmath17 of the old @xmath35 in the rest frame of the old @xmath44 , and are not closer in angle to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 , @xmath38 , or @xmath39 .",
    "4 .   replace the old jet 4-momentum estimates by the new ones and repeat step 3 a few times .",
    "this iteration converges completely for @xmath45 of events .",
    "a maximum of 10 iterations is sufficient , since the momenta stop changing before that for @xmath46 of events .",
    "the major new work is in step 3 , which is very easy to implement in the following way .",
    "treat the energy in every cell of the detector that receives energy above its noise level as if it came from a zero - mass particle .",
    "there will typically be a few hundred such cells in each event .",
    "make a list of their four - momenta .",
    "the appropriate elements of this list to be added in the various parts of step 3 can be found without making explicit lorentz transformations , using the exact formula for the angle @xmath47 between @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the rest frame of @xmath50 @xmath51 \\ , [ ( q \\ ! \\cdot \\ !",
    "r)^2 - q^2 \\ , r^2 ] } } \\ ; , \\label{eq : costhe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which holds for any four - vectors @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath50 .",
    "to test the idea , herwig 5.7 @xcite was used to simulate the single - leptonic top channel at the tevatron energy @xmath54 .",
    "typical experimental cuts were approximated by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the four hadron jets were required , at the partonic level , to have @xmath58 and to be isolated in lego from the lepton by @xmath59 and from each other by @xmath60 .",
    "the detector was simulated by an array of @xmath61 cells in @xmath62 , covering the region @xmath63 .",
    "gaussian energy resolutions with @xmath64 for charged hadrons and @xmath65 for leptons and photons were assumed ( in @xmath66 units ) .",
    "a small amount of shower spreading was also included : the energy of each final hadron was spread over a disk of radius @xmath67 in the @xmath62 plane , before being deposited in the appropriate calorimeter cells .",
    "a cone - type jet finding algorithm described previously @xcite was used to search for jets in the simulated calorimeter .",
    "a small cone size @xmath68 was used , as is standard practice in top quark analysis ( cdf uses @xmath69 ) to reduce the loss of events from overlapping jets , since one is asking for 4 jets within a rather small area in lego  _",
    "e.g. _ , all four decay jets lie within some strip of width @xmath70 in @xmath71 in @xmath72 of the events .",
    "a minimum observed jet @xmath11 of @xmath73 was required .",
    "a feature of my jet - finder @xcite is that it finishes with an iteration in which each cell of the detector that lies within @xmath74 of at least one jet axis is assigned to the nearest jet axis .",
    "the jet momenta are then recomputed and this procedure is repeated .",
    "this feature tends to improve the mass resolution for objects decaying into jets .",
    "it is similar to the procedure being tried here , except that the nearest jets are now to be defined by angles in the appropriate rest frames .    to obtain a sample that could be cleanly interpreted ,",
    "the `` observed '' jets in the simulation were matched to their original quark partons , using a criterion based on the agreement in lego variables @xmath71 and @xmath75 , along with a contribution from the agreement in @xmath11 .",
    "a good match was obtained for @xmath76 of the events , upon which fig .  1 and fig .",
    "2 are based .",
    "1 shows the histogram of the mass observed for @xmath77 .",
    "the _ dotted curve _ is for jets defined by @xmath78 in the lego variables of the detector .",
    "note that the center of the peak is well below the actual @xmath79 assumed in the simulation , and that the peak is very asymmetrical , with a tail toward lower @xmath80 masses .",
    "this skewing of the mass distribution toward low mass is a direct result of gluon radiation falling outside the cone , which is characteristic of qcd , and which has been verified at lep .",
    "it demonstrates that making qcd corrections is a very important part of the top quark mass measurement , especially if a cone size as small as @xmath81 is used .",
    "the _ solid curve _ in fig .  1 shows the result of redefining the jets using a larger cone size @xmath82 .",
    "this included an iteration in which each calorimeter cell that lies within @xmath74 of at least one of the 3 jet axes from hadronic @xmath1 decay is reassigned to the jet with the nearest of those axes .",
    "this iteration is crucial to obtaining the improvement in mass resolution shown .",
    "note that the qualitative qcd feature of skewing toward lower mass is still visible , but much less pronounced . also , the center of the peak is at a higher mass , closer to the true partonic mass .",
    "the cone size @xmath83 is about optimal .",
    "if the width of the mass peak is defined by the range @xmath84 that contains the middle @xmath85 of the probability distribution , then @xmath86 goes from @xmath87 to @xmath88 to @xmath89 as @xmath74 is increased from @xmath81 to @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "the _ dashed curve _ in fig .  1 shows the result of redefining the jets in the appropriate decay rest frames by the steps enumerated above .",
    "the curve shown is for @xmath18 , which is about optimal .",
    "one sees that the mass resolution obtained this way is quite good ( @xmath92 ) , but not as good as the @xmath83 curve .",
    "provide as good or slightly better resolution , as shown here . ]",
    "2 shows a similar histogram of the mass observed for @xmath93 .",
    "one again sees qcd skewing of the peak toward lower masses , relative to the value @xmath94 assumed in the simulation .",
    "this mass shift includes a contribution of @xmath95 from losses in observed jet energy due to neutrinos .",
    "one again sees a dramatic reduction in skewing and improvement in the resolution , when the cone size is increased from @xmath96 ( _ dotted curve _ ) to @xmath97 ( _ solid curve _ ) . we emphasize that to obtain this improvement ,",
    "it is essential to use the iterative procedure whereby each calorimeter cell is assigned to the nearest decay jet axis .",
    "the cone size @xmath83 is again about optimal . defining as before the width of the peak by the range @xmath84 that contains the middle @xmath85 of the probability distribution",
    ", @xmath86 goes from @xmath98 to @xmath99 to @xmath100 as @xmath74 is increased from @xmath81 to @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "the suggestion to define the jets using a fixed cone angle in the rest frame of the @xmath1 for the @xmath29-jet , and in the rest frame of the @xmath2 for its decay jets , which was proposed in this section , leads to the _ dashed curve _ in fig .  2 .",
    "one sees that , as in fig .  1 , this plausible idea does not in fact improve the mass resolution ( @xmath101 ) , compared to @xmath97 cones  although it is not much worse , either .",
    "so far , we have computed the observed masses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 directly from the 4-momenta of the jets into which they decay , as simply the invariant mass of the sum of those jet momenta .",
    "the estimated 4-momentum of each jet is obtained by adding the 4-momenta detected by the calorimeter cells inside its jet cone .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are thus formally treated as decaying into a large number of zero - mass particles that represent the energies deposited in the detector .",
    "defined in this way , the individual jets have sizeable invariant masses  often on the order of @xmath102 or higher .    a possible alternative method to determine the top mass in each event would be to use only the _ directions _ of the jets in the top rest frame , treating the jets as zero - mass objects . to do this , let @xmath103 and @xmath104 be the angles between the @xmath29-jet and the two jets from @xmath2 decay in that frame .",
    "then @xmath105 is the angle between the @xmath2 decay jets . according to zero - mass kinematics , @xmath106",
    "the angles needed in this formula can be obtained from the measured jet 4-momenta in any frame using eq .",
    "( [ eq : costhe ] ) . at the partonic level ,",
    "the use of zero - mass kinematics is promising since , _",
    "e.g. _ , the energy of the @xmath29-quark is @xmath107 , so the influence of its mass @xmath108 is very small .",
    "an advantage of this technique is that it measures the top quark mass in units of @xmath28 , which is independently known @xcite . because a dimensionless ratio is measured ,",
    "the result for @xmath12 is insensitive to any constant overall scale factor in the energy measurements .    for comparison with the results of sect .",
    "[ sec : cones ] , the mass distribution obtained using this jet angle method are plotted as the _ dot - dash curve _ in fig .  2 , by scaling with the value of @xmath28 assumed in the simulation . _ the mass distribution is narrower than the best previous result by about @xmath109 . _",
    "in addition to improved mass resolution , the curve is seen to be nearly symmetrical , and the center of the peak is very close to the mass value @xmath110 assumed in the simulation .",
    "the shift in the peak value due to the non - detection of neutrinos in the jets is also somewhat smaller when the jet angle method is used .",
    "when the simulation is repeated using @xmath111 , the center of the peak in @xmath112 determined by the jet angle method again comes out within @xmath113 of the input @xmath114 , so the good features found above are not specific to the assumed mass value .",
    "the nearly exact agreement with the input mass is of course partly accidental  _",
    "e.g. _ , the output mass would shift upward by @xmath115 if the calorimeter were able to detect neutrinos .",
    "the important result is that the output mass is close to the input one , and tracks it proportionally .",
    "the curve shown is for jets defined by @xmath97 , which is approximately optimal ; but a further advantage of the jet angle method is that it is found to be less sensitive to the choice of @xmath74 than is the traditional invariant mass method . defining the jets using fixed cones in the rest frames as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : cones ] , and then using the angle method to compute @xmath116 also works , but not quite as well as simply using the lego definition with @xmath117 .",
    "so far , we have explicitly used the original parton momenta , which are known in the simulation program , to determine the correct assignments of the observed jets . in real life , of course , that luxury is unavailable , so one faces a combinatoric problem in analyzing semileptonic @xmath4 events .",
    "there are 12 ways to assign 4 observed jets to the @xmath29-jet from semileptonic @xmath1 decay , the @xmath29-jet from hadronic @xmath1 decay , and the two jets from hadronic @xmath2 decay",
    ". there may be fewer combinations to try if one or both of the @xmath29-jets has been tagged ; but there may be many more , since frequently there are additional jets , _",
    "e.g. _ , from initial state radiation .",
    "hence mass histograms like figs .  1 and 2 will be contaminated by a background from events in which the jets are misassigned .    in order to test our methods directly ,",
    "the herwig events and calorimeter simulation described above were used without making parton level cuts , and without using any of the partonic information to determine the correct jet assignments , in the following simplified event analysis :    1 .",
    "jets with observed @xmath118 are found using @xmath119 cones in @xmath62 space .",
    "if fewer than 4 jets are found , the event is rejected .",
    "2 .   if more than 4 jets are found , only those with the 4 largest values of @xmath11 are kept .",
    "we ignore @xmath29-tagging here , so all 12 ways of assigning the jets to the 4 expected jets are examined .",
    "( by trying all possible subsets of 4 jets , it would be possible to reclaim an additional @xmath120 of good events ; but the combinatoric and non - top backgrounds to those events would be considerably larger , and the mass resolution not quite as good , so this will be of doubtful value even in the final data analysis . )",
    "an iteration similar to that described in sect .",
    "[ sec : cones ] is carried out , so that each calorimeter cell within @xmath97 of any one of the 4 significant jet axes is associated with the nearest of those axes .",
    "the transverse momentum of the neutrino is estimated as usual as the negative of the total observed @xmath121 .",
    "its longitudinal momentum is estimated by requiring @xmath122 to equal the @xmath2 mass used in the simulation .",

    "( [ eq : massellnu ] ) has no solution ( because @xmath128 ) , we take @xmath129 @xcite ; or reject the event if there is no solution with @xmath130",
    "we reject some candidate jet assignments immediately on the basis of very loose cuts : we require @xmath131 for the leptonically decaying top and @xmath132 for the hadronically decaying @xmath2 .",
    "( broad cuts on the hadronic top mass , or on the minimum non-@xmath2 dijet mass in the hadronic top might also be useful at this point @xcite . )",
    "6 .   to select the correct jet assignment according to the best fit to the leptonic top and hadronic @xmath2 masses , we define a measure of fit by @xmath133 the parameters @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 in @xmath66 units were found using the previous simulation , by making the range @xmath138 correspond to the middle @xmath24 of the probability distribution for @xmath139 for the correct jet assignment , while @xmath140 corresponds similarly to the middle @xmath24 of the @xmath141 distribution for @xmath2 decay . the cubic ( @xmath142 ) and quadratic ( @xmath143 ) forms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d1d2 ] ) were chosen because these quantities have more symmetrical probability distributions than the qcd - skewed masses themselves .",

    "+ when it comes time to analyze real data , the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d1d2 ] ) can be tuned using monte carlo events .",
    "also , the parameters in @xmath146 should be adjusted to be self - consistent with @xmath12 as measured by the hadronic @xmath1 decays .",
    "actually , the analysis could no doubt be improved by allowing for differences in the expected range for the observed @xmath139 , based on the configuration of @xmath147 and @xmath148 momenta .",
    "additional contributions to the measure of fit for each possible jet assignment could also be included , _",
    "e.g. _ , based upon the transverse and longitudinal momenta of the @xmath1 and @xmath149 .",
    "the jet assignment that gives the lowest value of @xmath150 is assumed to be the correct one .",

    "otherwise , the corresponding mass for @xmath155 is entered into a histogram to create fig .",
    "note that we adopt the idea advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath1 mass measurement should be based on the hadronically decaying top .",
    "the mass of the leptonically decaying one contributes only to choosing the correct set of jet assignments .",
    "this avoids a number of possibilities for systematic errors due to uncertainties in the neutrino momentum measurement .",
    "only the central value assumed for the leptonic decay mass needs to be tuned to match the final average @xmath12 found in the experiment .",
    "if the assumed value is incorrect , it will reduce the signal rate , but should not change the measured hadronic top mass .",
    "3 shows the @xmath112 distributions for @xmath156 .",
    "the _ dotted curve _ shows the invariant mass given by the original @xmath119 cones .",
    "the _ solid curve _ shows the invariant mass given by @xmath97 cones , including the iteration that assigns calorimeter cells to the nearest decay jet axis .",
    "note that going from @xmath119 to @xmath97 yields a dramatic improvement in the sharpness of the peak , and considerably reduces the downward shift in mass relative to the @xmath157 input to the simulation .",
    "the benefits of going to @xmath97 cones is actually even greater than what is shown here , because the larger cones were used to infer the correct jet assignments for both curves .",
    "the _ dot - dashed curve _ shows the result of calculating @xmath112 by the jet angle method of sect .",
    "[ sec : angles ] .",
    "it shows a clear peak that is more symmetrical and is centered closer to the input value of @xmath12 , confirming the results of sect .",
    "[ sec : angles ] .",
    "the peak is not quite as high as the @xmath97 result , which may be due to the fact that the ordinary cone method is somewhat less affected by misassigned jets , since the value it gives for @xmath112 is independent of which of the three dijet pairs is identified as the hadronically decaying @xmath2 .    the jet angle method and the ordinary invariant mass offer two largely independent measurements of @xmath112 in each event .",
    "we can combine the two measurements to obtain an average that has smaller errors than either measurement by itself . to allow for the fact that the two measurements contain different systematic mass shifts , it is seems appropriate to combine them by taking their geometric mean @xmath158 , although the distribution of their simple average is almost identical .",
    "the resulting mass histogram , shown as the _ dashed curve _ in fig .",
    "3 , displays the best peak of all .",
    "this mass variable is therefore most promising for future analyses of @xmath4 data .",
    "in summary , we have seen that    1 .   to obtain the best mass resolution for hadronic top decays ,",
    "it is essential to use a sufficiently large cone size @xmath159 in the lego variables @xmath160 , @xmath161 of the detector , and to include an iteration whereby final particles within each of the four jet cones @xmath21 of the @xmath4 final state are self - consistently assigned to the nearest axis .",
    "quantitatively , going from @xmath68 to @xmath162 reduces the width of the top mass peak by a factor @xmath163 . going on from @xmath162 to @xmath83 reduces it by a further factor @xmath164 .",
    "2 .   a suggestion to define the jets by cones of fixed angle in the rest frames of the decaying @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "was argued to be plausible and shown to be simple to carry out , but did not in fact improve the mass resolution .",
    "instead , it gave results similar to @xmath117 .",
    "3 .   a suggestion to compute the top mass in each event on the basis of the jet angles in the measured @xmath1 rest frame , using the zero - mass kinematical formula eq .  ( [ eq : angles ] ) , was shown to make a significant improvement in the measurement of @xmath12 .",
    "it reduces the width of the top mass peak slightly , and makes the peak more symmetrical and less sensitive to the choice of @xmath74 .",
    "this jet angle method is very easy to apply , since the necessary angles are easily computed from the jet four - momentum estimates using eq .",
    "( [ eq : costhe ] ) . a further advantage of this method is that it measures @xmath12 as a ratio to the known @xmath28 , and is thus insensitive to the absolute calibration for jet energy measurements .",
    "an even better measure of @xmath12 in each event can be obtained using the geometric mean @xmath165 of the two measures of @xmath112 given by the ordinary lorentz - invariant mass of the three - jet system , and the jet angle method .",
    "these conclusions have been confirmed by the simulation of sect .",
    "[ sec : direct ] , which is a simplified version of the essence of actual @xmath4 data analysis .    to clarify the point regarding cone size ,",
    "let us examine the standard experimental practice of `` correcting '' the jet @xmath11 measured in a small cone , by a factor that is determined from monte carlo simulation , or experimentally , _",
    "e.g. _ , by studying the @xmath11 balance of hard scattering in events with a direct photon and a jet .",
    "this correction factor could in general be a function of @xmath11 and @xmath71 .",
    "however , no such `` out - of - cone correction '' can improve the trijet mass resolution on a par with actually _ using _ larger cones , since when the latter is done , the revisions in @xmath11 are found to vary widely from case to case as a direct result of the qcd collinear radiation singularity .",

    "quantitatively , the middle @xmath167 of the probability distribution extends from @xmath168 to @xmath169 for the @xmath29-jets , and from @xmath170 to @xmath171 for the jets from @xmath2 decay",

    "the jet angle method has been shown to have significant advantages .",
    "although the rest - frame cone method was found to be no better than the standard procedure , it should still be pursued on the grounds that its systematic errors might be different from the conventional analysis .",
    "most importantly , the mass variable @xmath172 , defined as the geometric mean of the two estimates of @xmath12 using @xmath97 cones , should be tried since it produced the best mass resolution of all methods examined here .",
    "the improved resolution should help to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the location of the mass peak , which will arise from the rather small number of events ( @xmath173 ) expected in each experiment by the end of the current tevatron running period .",
    "this technique should therefore improve the accuracy of the top quark mass measurement .",
    "the next steps , which can only be carried out by the experimenters of cdf and d , must be to try these procedures using full detector simulations , and then real data .",

    "<S> two possible ways to improve the mass resolution for observing hadronic top quark decay @xmath0 are studied : ( 1 ) using fixed cones in the rest frames of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 to define the decay jets , instead of the traditional cones in the rest frame of the detector ; and ( 2 ) using the jet angles in the top rest frame to measure @xmath3 . by monte carlo simulation , </S>",
    "<S> the second method is found to give a useful improvement in the mass resolution . </S>",
    "<S> it can be combined with the usual invariant mass method to get an even better mass measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the improved resolution can be used to make a more accurate determination of the top quark mass , and to improve the discrimination between @xmath4 events and background for studies of the production mechanism . </S>"
