    "the rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( including milky way ) show that this type of galaxies have dark halo structure @xcite .",
    "one of the candidates for the dark matter in the galactic halo may be massive compact halo objects ( machos ) .",
    "paczyski ( 1986 ) proposed a gravitational microlensing technique as an indirect way of detecting machos . since his proposal , many groups began monitoring millions of stars of the milky way in the directions of the spiral arms , the galactic bulge and the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc & smc ) and detected hundreds of microlensing candidates @xcite . looking in the direction of the lmc and smc ( which are the most important for estimating galactic halo mahcos ) , exprience de recherche dobjets sombres ( eros ) and macho observers found only a dozen of microlensing candidates @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of lmc and smc events is based on the statistical analysis of the distribution of the duration of the events .",
    "the result of this analysis attribute a mean mass to machos and their mass contribution in the galactic halo . with the standard halo model , the mean mass of lenses",
    "is evaluated to be about half of that of the solar mass with a 20 per cent contribution in the galactic halo mass .",
    "+ the results obtained by the analysis of lmc microlensing events , however , do not agree with other observations @xcite .",
    "studying the kinematics of white dwarfs that have been discovered @xcite has shown that halo white dwarfs corresponds to @xmath0 per cent of the halo mass .",
    "recent re - analysis of the same data @xcite shows that this fraction is an order of magnitude smaller than the value derived in oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if there were as many white dwarfs in the halo as suggested by the microlensing experiments , they would increase the abundance of heavy metals via the evolution of white dwarfs and type i supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "the other problem is that for the mass of the machos to be in the range proposed by microlensing observations , the initial mass function ( imf ) of macho progenitors of the galactic halo should be different from those of the disc @xcite , otherwise we should observe at the tail of mass function ( mf ) a large number of luminous stars and heavy star explosions in the galactic halos .",
    "+ in this study we use the hypothesis of a spatially varying mf ( instead of uniform dirac - delta mf for the halo machos ) to interpret the lmc microlensing candidates ( kerins & evans 1998 , hereafter ke ) .",
    "the physical motivation for the hypothesis of spatially varying mfs of machos comes from baryonic cluster formation theories @xcite .",
    "these models predict the spatial variation of mf in the galactic halo in such a way that the the inner halo comprises partly visible stars , in association with the globular cluster population , while the outer halo comprises mostly low - mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "+ we extend the work of ke by ( i ) using spatially varying mf model in the power - law halo model @xcite , including the contribution disc , spheroid and lmc for comparison with the latest ( 5 yr ) lmc microlensing data ( alcock et al . 2000 ) ; ( ii ) using a statistical approach applied by green & jedamzik ( 2002 ) and rahvar ( 2004 ) to compare the distribution of the duration of the observed events with the galactic models ; and ( iii ) performing a likelihood analysis to find the best parameters of the inhomogeneous mf model .",
    "+ the advantage of using spatially varying mf models is that the active mean mass of lenses as the mean mass of observed lenses is always larger than mean mass of overall lenses .",
    "this effect is shown by a monte - carlo simulation , and taking it into account may resolve the problems with interpreting microlensing data . + this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief account of the hypothesis of spatially varying mfs and the galactic models used in our analysis . in section 3",
    "we perform a numerical simulation to generate the expected distribution of events , taking into account the observational efficiency of the macho experiment . in section 4",
    "we compare the theoretical distribution of the duration of the events with the observation .",
    "we also perform a likelihood analysis to find the best parameters of the mf for compatibility with the observed data .",
    "the results are discussed in section 5 .",
    "spiral galaxies have three components : the halo , the disc and the bulge .",
    "we can combine these components to build various galactic models @xcite . in this section",
    "we give a brief account on the power - law halo and disc models which can contribute to the lmc microlensing events .",
    "in the second part we discuss about mfs of machos and our physical motivation for considering spatially varying mfs .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with this procedure we obtain the distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for three categories of ( i ) dirac - delta mf ; ( ii ) a spatially varying mf ; and ( iii ) a spatially varying mf with the optimized parameters compatible with the data , resulting from the likelihood analysis",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] compare the distributions of the observed @xmath1 and @xmath2 with three mf models used in eight power - law galactic models . comparing the observed value , indicated by cross in figs [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , with the theoretical distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , shows that for dirac - delta mf , some of the galactic models such as a , c and e are in agreement with the observations while for the ke model non of them are compatible with the data .",
    "+ to find the spatially varying mf model that is compatible with the observations , we perform a likelihood analysis to obtain the best upper limit of the macho mass and the size of the halo in the ke model .",
    "the results of analysis in the power - law galactic models are shown in table [ 3 ] with the corresponding distribution of the duration of events in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show that the standard model and models a , b , c and d using this mf are in good agreement with the data .",
    "+ in addition to the hypothesis of a spatially varying mf , there are other hypothesis , such as self - lensing , that need to be confirmed using sufficient statistics of microlensing events .",
    "recent microlensing surveys such as optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) and supermacho are monitoring lmc stars and will provide more microlensing candidates over the coming years . to use the results of our analysis in the mentioned experiments",
    ", we obtained the theoretical distribution of events in each model without applying any observational efficiency ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the expected distribution of events in each experiment can be obtained by multiplying the observational efficiencies to these theoretical models .",
    "+ it is worth to mention that our statistical analysis is sensitive to our estimation of the duration of the microlensing candidates .",
    "the correction with the blending effect can alter our result .",
    "the blending effect makes a source star to be brighter than its actual brightness , and the lensing duration appears shorter . the duration of a microlensing event can be determined from a light curve fit in which the brightness of the source star is included as a fitting parameter .",
    "the main problem with this standard method is the degeneracy caused by the fitting .",
    "high - resolution images by the _",
    "hst _ have been used to resolve blending by random field stars in eight lmc microlensing events @xcite .",
    "the macho group also used another procedure where each event is fitted with a light curve that assumes no blending and then a correction is applied to the time - scale to account for the fact that blending tends to make the time scales appear shorter .",
    "this correction was determined from the efficiency of a monte carlo simulation , and it is a function of the time - scale of the measured event . the procedure is designed to give the correct average event time - scale , but it does not preserve the width of the time - scale distribution @xcite .",
    "green & jedamzik ( 2002 ) and rahvar ( 2004 ) showed that the width of duration of events derived from this method is narrower than the theoretical expectations .",
    "in this work we extended the hypothesis of a spatially varying mf proposed by ke as a possible solution resolving discrepancies between microlensing results and other observations .",
    "the main point of this is to investigate the contradiction where microlensing experiments predict large numbers of white dwarfs which have not been observed .",
    "+ the advantage of using a spatially varying mf is that we can modify our interpretation of microlensing data .",
    "we showed that in this model , in contrast to the dirac - delta mf , massive machos contribute in the microlensing events more frequently than the low - mass ones do . to quantify our argument we defined two mass scales , the active mean mass of machos as the mean mass of lenses that can be observed by the gravitational microlensing experiment and the passive mean mass of machos as the overall mean mass of them .",
    "we showed that the active mean mass of machos is always larger than the passive mean mass , except in the case of a uniform dirac delta mf where they are equal .",
    "+ to test the compatibility of this model with the observed microlensing events , we compared the duration distribution of the events in this model with the lmc candidates of macho experiment .",
    "we used two statistical parameters - the mean and the width of the duration of events - to compare the observed data with the theoretical models .",
    "we showed that amongst power - low halo models some of them with a dirac - delta mf are compatible with the data , while in the case ke model , almost none of them are compatible with the data .",
    "the best parameters for the ke model were obtained with likelihood analysis . in the spatially",
    "varying mf using the new parameters , some galactic models ( such as standard model and models a , b , c and d ) were compatible with the data .",
    "the hypothesis of a spatially varying mf of machos may be tested by measuring the proper motions of white dwarfs in the galactic halo @xcite .",
