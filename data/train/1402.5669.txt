    "a useful and very accurate technique for obtaining the final transition probabilities is the dykhne - davis - pechukas method , or ddp method , first introduced by dykhne and given a rigorous mathematical formulation later by davis and pechukas @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the ddp method is that , in the adiabatic limit , the two - state coupling is universal , independent of a given model , and the contributions to the t transition probability @xmath40 between the adiabatic states are given by the complex plane zeros of the adiabatic eigenenergies , in the form of an exponential .",

    "the contributions from the farther zeroes are exponentially small compared to the dominant ones and may therefore be neglected .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that dykhne - davis - pechukas ( ddp ) method davis76 can be used to examine  the adiabatic limit of population transfer in two - level models driven by a chirped laser field .",
    "in @xcite the final population transfer for different trajectories in the parameter space in the adiabatic limit is analyzed .",

    "_ @xcite have used the ddp method to optimize the adiabatic passage between two states , assuming that the probability for nonadiabatic losses could be determined by the brhaviour of the transition points @xmath77 .",
    "they have proposed to suppress the nonadiabatic losses altogether by choosing the rabi frequency @xmath18 and the detuning @xmath19 such that there are _ no transition points_. this condition is obviously fulfilled if the quasienergy splitting is _ constant _ , @xmath78the later condition also manifests the choice of a detuning and rabi frequency defined with eqs .",

    "do not have transition points and lead to vanishing nonadiabatic corrections .",
    "the optimization based on ddp is not exact in the sense that it is performed by using approximate technique .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the corrections to this ddp optimization .",
    "although we are able to design models that yield according to the ddp , vanishing nonadiabatic corrections there is no way to calculate the transition probability for these models again using ddp method in the diabatic basis .",
    "ddp approximation comprise nonadiabatic corrections not only from the first - order perturbation theory in the adiabatic basis but adding the contributions from all orders via correct prefactor .",
    "even so , using ddp not in the diabatic but in the first adiabatic basis is instructive .",
    "this is also a way to calculate the deviation form the ddp optimization and to reveal the nature of the oscillation behavior for the transition probability for models that are designed to minimize the nonadiabatic corrections  @xcite .",
    "we note that the the probability of transition in the adiabatic basis @xmath38 is equal to the probability of no transition in the diabatic basis and the both are related via ( [ pp ] ) . using the parametrization ( [ omega - delta ] ) for the schrdinger equation in the adiabatic basis , the transformed hamiltonian up to phase transformation",

    "this means that applying a ddp method in the first adiabatic basis instead of the diabatic one , one could analyze the nonadiabatic corrections of the optimized adiabatic passage .      as a particular example we will consider a level crossing model ,    @xmath82 , \\qquad \\omega ( t)=\\omega _ { 0}\\cos \\left [ \\frac{\\pi } { 2}\\text{erf}(t / t)% \\right ] .   \\label{erf}\\ ] ]    this model in the adiabatic basis",

    "we will briefly review details of such calculation , but the reader could find a similar calculation in more details in @xcite .      for the gaussian model ( [ model ] ) , there are infinitely many transition points in the upper half - plane . in terms of the dimensionless time @xmath84 ,",
    "they are given by    [ transition points ] @xmath85where @xmath86 and    @xmath87    for @xmath88 , we have    [ transition points small ] @xmath89hence , as @xmath90 decreases , the transition points approach the imaginary axis and in the limit @xmath91 coalesce ( logarithmically ) with their counterparts in the second quadrant .    as we have mentioned the transition probability for the models choosen to satisfy the ddp optimization condition ( [ trajectory ] ) show oscillating behavior , although they should  yield optimized addiabatic passage .",
    "this is due to the fact that ddp is approximate method .",
    "a particular model without transition points in the diabatic basis , generally has a transition point in the first adiabatic basis .",
    "as in the gaussian model the contributions from this transition points lead to oscilations , according to ddp formula ( dp - n ) .",
    "it is important to note the relation between the asymptotic bahaviour of the transition points for @xmath88 and the adiabatic limit . from the definition of the model ( [ erf ] ) is clear that the limit @xmath92 can be seen as the adiabatic limit , so @xmath93 play role of the adiabatic parameter . from the definition ( [ alpha ] )",
    "we see that @xmath94 is proportional to the adiabatic parameter and the limit @xmath95 is the adiabatic limit .",
    "according to the asymptotic behavior of the transition points , the transition point from the first quadrant logarithmically coalesce with their counterpart in the second quadrant.and approach the imaginary axis . since in the limit @xmath91 , which is perfect adiabatic regime , we do not have a coherent contribution to the ddp formula ( [ dp - n ] ) from two transition points , no oscillations will be seen .",
    "this simple analysis shows that even in the first adiabatic basis , the correct asymptotic behaviors of the optimized adiabatic passage is achieved .      because for the gaussian model ( [ model ] ) there are infinitely many transition points , the most accurate transition probability is expected to be given by the generalized ddp formula ( [ dp - n ] ) . the dominant contributions to the sum in this formula originate from the two transition points closest to the real axis , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . for simplicity",
