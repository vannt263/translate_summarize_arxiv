    "we present an approach that allows the determination of gas uptake in crystalline porous materials considering only geometrical constraints for the crystal and its interaction energy with the guest molecule .",
    "the derivation of this general equation for the uptake of crystalline porous frameworks was validated with experimentally available data for metal - organic frameworks ( mof ) .",
    "we applied this general equation to calculate the net storage capacity of molecular hydrogen storage ( h@xmath1 ) in mofs . in this work",
    "we propose the ideal interaction energy and the ideal linker length for metal - organic frameworks ( mof ) given a topology ( or crystalline lattice figure [ fig : topology ] ) , however , in principle , this approach can be extended to any crystalline porous material .",
    "currently there are not simple guidelines for the optimal design of the linker length and the storage capacity of porous frameworks .",
    "these results will serve to design materials that maximize net gas storage capacity .",
    "this paper is organized into several sections . in subsections",
    "iia and iib , we derive the general equation for adsorption in any framework , given its geometric properties ( i.e. void volume , pore volume , surface area and pore size ) and enthalpy of adsorption with the guest molecule ( i.e. interaction energy with the surface ) .",
    "we also describe an approach to find the effective number of layers in the more realistic restricted multilayer theory ( rmt ) .",
    "frameworks with several types of topologies ( cells ) are also considered . in subsection iiia",
    ", we compare our predictions of adsorption isotherm to experimental measurements for system temperatures @xmath2  k. in subsection iiib we derive the optimal enthalpy of adsorption and linker - length / void - volume for the highest net gas storage capacity between atmospheric pressure and the maximum pressure a tank can achieve .",
    "the derivation of the general formula for the adsorption process is solely restricted to the topology of the framework .",
    "we define the topology of a framework as the connectivity in all directions to make a periodic structure .",
    "a simple example is shown in figure  [ fig : topology ] .",
    "this topology is going to determine the number of absorption sites available for our system .",
    "the first set of theories available to estimate the adsorption properties of surfaces were the langmuir theory , published in 1916 , followed by the brunauer - emmett - teller ( bet ) theory , published in 1938 @xcite .",
    "however these two theories , though very useful , have limited application to crystalline porous materials .",
    "the langmuir theory assumes that only one layer of sorbate molecules can be formed on the surface , whereas the bet theory assumes that an infinite number of layers can exist .",
    "both assumption are unphysical for a crystalline porous material , which can usually host more than one layer , but not an infinite number .",
    "thus , a more appropriate approach is needed to treat the case of adsorption in crystalline porous materials , which we call restricted multilayer theory ( rmt ) in this work .",
    "the derivation of the langmuir and bet theories can be found in the suplementary information ( section [ sup_info : sorptionderivation ] ) or elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we will show below that the equation for a restricted number of multilayers is a more general equation that gives the langmuir and the bet theory as solutions .",

    "we assume that there are only three types of interactions in the system , which are + 1 .",
    "those between the surface ( @xmath5 = 0 ) and first layer molecules ( @xmath5 = 1 ) , with partition function @xmath6 + 2 .",
    "those between first layer molecules ( @xmath5 = 1 ) and second layer molecules ( @xmath5 = 2 ) , with partition function @xmath7 , and + 3 . those between @xmath8 ( @xmath5 @xmath9 1 ) layer molecules and @xmath10 layer molecules , with partition function @xmath11 . +",
    "this creates a columnar structure of bound molecules .",
    "additionally , we assume that there are no interactions between molecules of neighboring columns and the partition function @xmath7 is equal to @xmath11 .",
    "given the total number of molecules , @xmath4 , then @xmath12 of them are in the first layer and @xmath13 are in higher layers .",
    "from these set of assumptions , we can derive the adsorption behavior for a restricted number of multilayers ( @xmath5 layers ) .    using the grand canonical partition function",

    "similar results were obtained earlier @xcite , however in these treatments , the topology of the framework , along with other geometrical constraints and the specific gas properties were not taken into account .",
    "we do this in the following section .      here",
    "we derive a general equation for the uptake , @xmath27 , defined as the total mass of gas that can be incorporated per unit volume of porous framework ( in units of g / l ) .",
    "this equation applies for any framework based on the rmt of adsorption and the geometric constraints of the framework .",
    "given that the molar mass of hydrogen @xmath28",
    "g / mol , the uptake per @xmath29 equals    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the volume of a pore , @xmath3 is the number of sites per pore , @xmath4 is a number of adsorbed hydrogen molecules per 1 l of adsorbent and @xmath32 is the avogadro constant .",
    "the factor @xmath33 corresponds to the fraction of free ( or void ) volume for the framework , i.e. void volume @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is the effective number of layers ( supl .",
    "section [ section : derivationofeffectivelayers ] ) .",
    "we also consider @xmath36 as the effective diameter of the absorbed molecule which equals @xmath37 for hydrogen ( see sup . info . ) . using this model it is possible to estimate the number of adsorption sites @xmath3 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a surface area of one cell .    strictly speaking we should also consider edge effects when one hydrogen molecule occupies two or more different sites .",
    "these considerations will be accounted for elsewhere .",
    "however , we should note that edge effects are significant only for nets for which the linker length is nearly the same as the diameter of guest gas molecule .",
    "most known synthesized frameworks have linker lengths that are significantly larger than the hydrogen molecule diameter , thus the edge effects should be negligible for current synthesized materials .    finally , we obtain the equation for uptake , which can be applied to any type of framework with only one type of conventional unit cell .",
    "@xmath40    @xmath41 and @xmath31 in equation   are pore surface area and pore volume , respectively .",
    "the occupancy ratio @xmath42 is defined using the rmt   by assuming that @xmath6 and @xmath11 are linked with enthalpies of adsorption on the first @xmath43 layer and higher layers @xmath44 as follows ( for more details see supp .",
    "info vi b ) .",
    "@xmath45    let us derive a more general equation for frameworks which have @xmath46 types of the conventional unit cells with volumes and surface areas @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "we also introduce factors @xmath49 for the fraction of volume occupied by every type of the cell . @xmath50 applying equation   to every type of cell separately , we get the total uptake    @xmath51    this equation is very general .",
    "in fact , it can be used for the challenging problem of predicting the uptake of multivariate metal - organic frameworks ( mtv - mofs ) where the pore volume changes due to the different functionalities of its linkers @xcite , thus generating a supercell of different types of cells where the uptake is not the average , but a more complex relationship .",
    "the application of this equation to the different mtv - mofs is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "in order to validate our results , we compared our predictions to experimental data for different mofs at @xmath53  k. we took 6 reported frameworks , namely mof-5 , mof-177 , mof-14 , snu-77h and mof-200 for this comparison .",

    "the agreement is fairly good , however there are some discrepancies in the pressure range of 5 - 30 bar .",
    "this can be explained by the slight decrease of adsorption enthalpy reported in  @xcite , thus suggesting that an effective @xmath54 should be used rather that the one at low coverage as reported in experiments ( see sup .",
