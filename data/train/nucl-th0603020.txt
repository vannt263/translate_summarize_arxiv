    "effective hadronic lagrangians are widely used the description of the interactions of hadrons . in this method a distinct quantum field is introduced for each relevant hadronic species , and interactions are assumed for these fields that are consistent with known symmetries and conservation laws . although a more physically justified description of hadron scattering amplitudes would employ momentum - dependent coupling constants ( form factors ) , it often suffices near threshold to assume pointlike  hard \" hadronic vertices with fixed coupling constants .",
    "this approximation may be relaxed by incorporating hadronic form factors as a power series of gradient interactions .",
    "unfortunately , this typically leads to nonrenormalizable ultraviolet divergences , which requires the determination of many coupling constants from experiment .",
    "when using effective lagrangians one typically ignores the existence of hadronic substructure ( quarks and gluons ) , and determines each coupling constant in the effective lagrangian from experiment .",
    "although this procedure is feasible in experimentally highly constrained problems such as the nn interaction , in other processes with little data the coupling constants are simply assigned plausible values . in such cases",
    "it would be very useful to have numerical estimates of the coupling constants .",
    "since these coupling constants and form factors are determined by the underlying qcd degrees of freedom , one may evaluate them directly in terms of the interactions of quarks and gluons and the substructure of the hadronic bound states .",
    "in this letter we will investigate this relation between effective lagrangian couplings and quark model bound state hadron wavefunctions .",
    "the specific cases we consider are the meson - nucleon couplings , which are usually fitted to data in meson exchange models of the nn force .",
    "these nn@xmath0 vertices are chosen as our initial examples in part because they are among the most important hadronic couplings for nuclear physics applications , and also because the nn@xmath5 coupling constant @xmath6 is the best determined strong coupling in hadron physics .",
    "it is clearly of interest to determine whether this experimental coupling constant is consistent with the value predicted using quark model hadron wavefunctions .",
    "we regard this computation as the first step in an attempt to compute the strong interactions of nucleons at all separations from microscopic quark - based models . in this approach",
    "the short ranged nn interactions are dominated by the quark - gluon forces encountered by overlapping nucleon quark wavefunctions , and the long ranged nn interactions are mediated by @xmath7-channel meson exchange .",
    "the meson - nucleon couplings in @xmath7-channel meson exchange , which we compute here , are themselves determined by the overlap of meson and nucleon quark wavefunctions .",
    "our method for defining effective hadronic coupling constants and form factors is to equate specific hadron emission amplitudes predicted by the effective hadron lagrangian to the corresponding decay amplitude in the quark model .",
    "applied to nn@xmath0 couplings in particular , we require that nm |h_eff|",

    "_ @xcite .",
    "ideally one would impose this relation using a relativistic quark model , in which case there would be no difficulty in identifying the effective lagrangian matrix element with the quark model result . as the nonrelativistic quark model formalism is much better established , we will instead use nonrelativistic quark model wavefunctions , and apply our defining relation eq.([eq : h_identity ] ) between matrix elements near threshold .",
    "since the quark model wavefunctions we use are nonrelativistic , the form factors we extract by equating quark model and ( relativistic ) field theory matrix elements have an ambiguity in how we relate results in different frames . in this initial study we will simply assume a particular frame , the  decay frame \" of a rest initial hadron , as in the earlier work of the orsay group @xcite .",
    "the complication of implicit frame dependence will be investigated in detail a subsequent study .",
    "it is important to note that these frame ambiguities are resolved in the weak binding and nonrelativistic limits , in which the quark model states approach the transformation properties specified by the lorentz group .",
    "thus our quark model predictions of form factors are best justified at zero three - momentum , where we define the coupling constants .",
    "of course the model assumption is that the predicted form factors remain useful estimates at moderate nonzero momentum .",
