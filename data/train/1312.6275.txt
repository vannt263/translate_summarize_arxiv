    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section states the natural conjecture about the martin boundary of random walk , killed when leaving a two - dimensional convex cone .",

    "the first significant work on the martin boundary of random walks in euclidean lattices is @xcite , where the authors show that every positive harmonic function @xmath46 for the random walk can be expressed as @xmath47 here @xmath14 is a positive borel measure on some suitable set @xmath48 .",
    "these types of functions and the types considered in remark [ remk : rmk1 ] of the next section are not harmonic for killed random walk on the quadrant .",
    "to `` make '' them harmonic , one has to consider the correction term .",
    "therefore the form of the functions in proposition [ prop : harmq ] .",
    "the main contribution of @xcite is to show that these functions are the whole martin boundary for the case of the positive quadrant ( see theorem 1 there).judging from the analogy between proposition [ prop : harm ] and [ prop : harmq ] , one can conjecture the following ( stated analoguously to theorem 1 in @xcite ) .",

    "this assumption seems to be neccessary , if one wants to work with the communication condition and is fulfilled in the positive quadrant setting due to irreducibility .",
    "the actual obstacle for generalizing the proof in the case of the positive quadrant is the lack of markov - additivity for local processes for the general case .",
