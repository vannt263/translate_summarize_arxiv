    "one of the important tasks of quantum mechanics is to find exact solutions of the wave equations ( nonrelativistic and relativistic ) for certain type of potentials of physical interest since they contain all the necessary information regarding the quantum system under consideration .",
    "for example , the exact solutions of these wave equations are only possible in a few simple cases such as the coulomb , the harmonic oscillator , pseudoharmonic and mie - type potentials [ 1 - 8 ] . for an arbitrary @xmath0-state",

    "some semiclassical and/or numerical solutions have been obtained by using pekeris approximation [ 9 - 13 ] . in recent years , many authors have studied the nonrelativistic and relativistic wave equations with certain potentials for the @xmath4- and @xmath0-waves .",
    "the exact and approximate solutions of these models have been obtained analytically [ 10 - 14 ] .",
    "many exponential - type potentials have been solved like the morse potential [ 12,13,15 ] , the hulthn potential [ 16 - 19 ] , the pschl - teller [ 20 ] , the woods - saxon potential [ 21 - 23 ] , the kratzer - type potentials [ 12,14,24 - 27 ] , the rosen - morse - type potentials [ 28,29 ] , the manning - rosen potential [ 30 - 33 ] , generalized morse potential [ 34 ] and other multiparameter exponential - type potentials [ 35 ] .",
    "various methods are used to obtain the exact solutions of the wave equations for this type of exponential potentials .",
    "these methods include the supersymmetric ( susy ) and shape invariant method [ 19,36 ] , the variational [ 37 ] , the path integral approach [ 31 ] , the standard methods [ 32,33 ] , the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) [ 38 ] , the exact quantization rule ( eqr ) [ 13,39,40 ] , the hypervirial perturbation [ 41 ] , the shifted @xmath5 expansion ( se ) [ 42 ] and the modified shifted @xmath5 expansion ( mse ) [ 43 ] , series method [ 44 ] , smooth transformation [ 45 ] , the algebraic approach [ 46 ] , the perturbative treatment [ 47,48 ] and the nikiforov - uvarov ( nu ) method [ 16,17,2026,49 - 51 ] and others .",
    "the nu method [ 51 ] is based on solving the second - order linear differential equation by reducing to a generalized equation of hypergeometric type .",

    "the nu method has shown its power in calculating the exact energy levels of all bound states for some solvable quantum systems .",
    "motivated by the considerable interest in exponential - type potentials [ 12 - 35 ] , we attempt to study the quantum properties of another exponential - type potential proposed by manning and rosen ( mr ) [ 29 - 33]@xmath6where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two - dimensionless parameters but the screening parameter @xmath9 has dimension of length and corresponds to the potential range [ 33 ] .",

    "unfortunately , for an arbitrary @xmath0-states ( @xmath17 in which the schrdinger equation does not admit an exact analytic solution . in such a case , the schrdinger equation is solved numerically [ 54 ] or approximately using approximation schemes [ 18,50,55,56,57 ] .",

    "we note that it is possible to recover the yukawa potential by letting @xmath156 and @xmath157 the hulthn potential behaves like the coulomb potential near the origin ( i.e. , @xmath182 ) @xmath183 but decreases exponentially in the asymptotic region when @xmath184 so its capacity for bound states is smaller than the coulomb potential [ 16 ] . obviously , the results are in good agreement with those obtained by other methods for short potential range , small @xmath8 and @xmath185 we have also studied two special cases for @xmath186 @xmath149 and hulthn potential .",

    "we have also found that the criteria for the choice of parameter @xmath7 requires that @xmath7 satisfies the inequality @xmath187 this means that for real bound state solutions @xmath7 should be chosen properly in our numerical calculations .",
    "a slight difference in the approximations of the numerical energy spectrum of schrdinger - mr problem is found in refs .",
    "[ 55,56 ] and present work since the approximation schemes are different by a small shift @xmath188 in our recent work [ 17 ] , we have found that the physical quantities like the energy spectrum are critically dependent on the behavior of the system near the singularity ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "that is why , for example , the energy spectrum depends strongly on the angular momentum @xmath0 , which results from the @xmath33 singularity of the orbital term , even for high excited states .",
    "it is found that the @xmath190 orbital term is too singular , then the validity of all such approximations is limited only to very few of the lowest energy states . in this case , to extend accuracy to higher energy states one may attempt to utilize the full advantage of the unique features of schrdinger equation .",
    "therefore , it is more fruitful to perform the analytic approximation of the less singularity @xmath191 rather than the too singular term @xmath33 which makes it possible to extend the validity of the results to higher excitation levels giving better analytic approximation for a wider energy spectrum [ 69 ] .",
