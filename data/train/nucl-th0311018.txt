    "<S> the total photoabsorption cross sections of the six - body nuclei are calculated including complete final state interaction via the lorentz integral transform method . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of nucleon - nucleon central p - wave forces is investigated . comparing to results with central potentials containing s - wave forces only , </S>",
    "<S> one finds considerably more strength in the low - energy cross sections and a rather strong improvement in comparison with experimental data , in particular for @xmath0li .    in a recent paper @xcite we carried out the first microscopic calculation of total photoabsorption cross sections for @xmath1 nuclei </S>",
    "<S> . semi - realistic central s - wave forces were taken as nn interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained cross sections were not in good agreement with the low - energy data . since @xmath0he and @xmath0li are p - shell nuclei we suspected in @xcite that this observable could show a sensitivity to the p - wave nn interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present work is to check this conjecture . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we use the recently published av4 potential @xcite , which includes s- and p - waves forces .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculation proceeds in the same way as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we summarize the main steps . </S>",
    "<S> the total photoabsorption cross section in unretarded dipole approximation is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fine structure constant , @xmath4 the photon energy , and @xmath5 the response function ; wave functions and energies of ground and final state are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , while @xmath8 is the unretarded dipole operator . here @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the third component of the isospin operator and of the spatial coordinate of the @xmath11-th particle in the center of mass frame , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method @xcite one obtains @xmath12 from the inversion of an integral transform with a lorentzian kernel @xmath13    where the `` lorentz state '' @xmath14 is the unique solution of an inhomogeneous `` schrdinger - like '' equation @xmath15 with asymptotic boundary conditions similar to a bound state . </S>",
    "<S> thus one can apply bound - state techniques for its solution . </S>",
    "<S> we expand @xmath16 and @xmath17 in terms of the six - body symmetrized hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion is performed up to maximal values of the hh grand - angular momentum quantum number @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we improve the convergence of the hh expansion using the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonics ( eihh ) approach @xcite , where the bare potential is replaced by an effective potential constructed via the lee - suzuki method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when convergence is reached , however , the same results are obtained as with the bare potential ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    as in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the lit calculating the quantity @xmath21 directly via the lanczos algorithm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we study the convergence of the lit as a function of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> our procedure consists in increasing @xmath18 until convergence of the ground state is reached and then studying the behavior of the lit with growing @xmath22 . in case of the av4 potential a sufficiently convergent result for the bound state is reached with @xmath23 ( yielding binding energies @xmath24 mev for @xmath0he and @xmath25 mev for @xmath0li ) . since @xmath26 depends on @xmath19 we also check whether the norm @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 , converges for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the transforms @xmath30 mev ) obtained with @xmath29 and 14 at fixed @xmath22 differ by less than @xmath31 . in case of a central s - wave interactions only , as for mti - iii @xcite and mn @xcite potentials , convergence is already reached at @xmath32 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we show the convergence of the lit for @xmath0li for the av4 and the mti - iii potentials . in the upper panel the two lit results obtained with the highest considered @xmath20 are presented , while in the two lower panels we show the relative error @xmath33 in percentage , for the two potentials separately . the quantity @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 one can clearly see a rather nice convergence pattern with increasing @xmath22 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we present an analogous picture for @xmath0he with the av4 and the mn potentials . </S>",
    "<S> one finds rather satisfactory results , but compared to @xmath0li the av4 case exhibits a slower convergence , e.g. , in the lower @xmath36 range , where mainly strength from the threshold region is sampled , one has @xmath37 in case of @xmath0li and @xmath38 in case of @xmath0he . </S>",
    "<S> figures 1 and 2 also illustrate that the convergence is better for pure s - wave potentials . </S>",
    "<S> thus an addition of p - wave interaction seems to lead to a slightly weaker convergence of the hh expansion . </S>",
    "<S> in fact performing lit calculations with a modified av4 potential , namely with switched off p - wave interaction , we get a convergence pattern similar to those of mn or mti - iii potentials .    in the following we want to describe in some more detail the lit calculation with @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> in table i we list the number @xmath40 of @xmath0li - hh basis states as a function of @xmath20 . for the total number of basis functions one has to multiply @xmath40 by the number @xmath41 of hyperradial states ( @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total number of states becomes quite high and it is desirable to discard hh states which give only negligible contributions to the lit . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we study the importance of the hh states according to their spatial symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> we find that quite a few of them can be safely neglected beyond given @xmath20 values ( see table ii ) . in this way for @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> we accomplish a reduction from @xmath43 to @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see in table ii , the symmetries labelled [ 111111],[21111 ] and [ 3111 ] are not included at all and others , namely [ 2211 ] and [ 321 ] , are considered only up to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked the quality of our approximation , performing full calculations without cuts for lower @xmath22 values and comparing the obtained lit results with those of a truncated calculation . when differences are negligible we conclude that omitted states have no influence also in calculations with higher @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the omission of the k=13 states of symmetry [ 321 ] could not be checked in such a way , but already its k=11 contribution is almost negligible and thus its k=13 contribution should be of no importance . </S>",
    "<S> in an analogous way we carry out the calculation of the lit for @xmath0he . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to mention that for this nucleus one has two separate hh expansions for @xmath14 , namely for the two isospin channels with t=1 and 2  ( see also @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> after having discussed the convergence of the lit we turn to the photodisintegration . in order to obtain </S>",
    "<S> the total photoabsorption cross section @xmath47 one has to invert the lit of ( 4 ) ( for details see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the response function @xmath12 and thus to @xmath47 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we show the results for the total photoabsorption cross section of @xmath0li and @xmath0he with the av4 potential . in comparison </S>",
    "<S> we also present our previous results from @xcite with mn and mti - iii potentials . </S>",
    "<S> one notes that the general structure of the cross section is similar for the various potential models , in particular the presence of two peaks for @xmath0he , but one also finds potential dependent results for peak positions and peak heights . the double peak structure of @xmath0he can be interpreted as a response of a _ halo _ nucleus , where the low - energy peak is due to the _ halo_@xmath3 core oscillation ( soft dipole response ) and the peak at higher energies due to the neutron - proton spheres oscillation ( gamow - teller mode or hard dipole response ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we show the theoretical results together with available experimental data . here </S>",
    "<S> we would like to mention that the data of @xcite have been taken via a semi - inclusive ( @xmath48 measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results correspond to the inclusive cross section up to an energy of about @xmath49 mev , where additional channels open up . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section due to those additional channels have been measured in further experiments @xcite . in order to have an estimate for the total cross section we have simply summed the @xmath50 data of @xcite to the cross sections of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] cited as @xcite are these sums .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4 ] shows that for the av4 potential one finds an enhancement of strength in the threshold region compared to the s - wave potentials . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the inclusion of the p - wave interaction improves the agreement with experimental data considerably . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly the case for @xmath0li . </S>",
    "<S> in fact with the av4 potential one has a rather good agreement with experimental data up to about 12 mev . in case of @xmath0he the increase of low - energy strength </S>",
    "<S> is not sufficient , there is still some discrepancy with data . </S>",
    "<S> probably , in order to describe the _ halo _ structure of this nucleus in more detail additional potential parts are needed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the spin - orbit component of the nn potential could play a role in the determination of the soft dipole resonance . </S>",
    "<S> in fact in a single particle picture of @xmath0he the two _ halo _ neutrons will mainly stay in a p - state and can interact with one of the core nucleons via the nn ls - force . </S>",
    "<S> another reason for the discrepancy could be the convergence . as already pointed out , our hh convergence is quite satisfactory for @xmath0li , whereas it is still not yet fully complete in case of @xmath0he . </S>",
    "<S> the pronounced _ halo _ structure of this nucleus could make the hh expansion more difficult . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless we would like to emphasize again that for all three potential models a typical @xmath0he _ halo _ response appears automatically from a microscopic six - body calculation , while other details of the response are very sensitive to the interaction model .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we can say that the p - wave interaction has an important impact on the low - energy total photoabsorption cross section of the six - body nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> it enhances the low - energy strength quite significantly . </S>",
    "<S> it also leads to a considerable improvement in the comparison of theoretical and experimental results , even if a fully satisfactory agreement is not yet reached . </S>",
    "<S> further investigations , both in theory and experiment , are needed . as already pointed out in @xcite experimental data </S>",
    "<S> are too few ( @xmath0he ) or do not present a clear picture ( @xmath0li ) . on the other hand , from the theoretical point of view , </S>",
    "<S> more effort has to be addressed to the inclusion of additional parts in the nn potentials . </S>",
    "<S> such future studies should lead to a better understanding which nn potential parts are relevant in the six - nucleon photodisintegration . </S>"
