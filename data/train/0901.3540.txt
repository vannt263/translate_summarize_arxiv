    "galaxy stellar mass ( gsm ) and galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) has been the main topics of numerous works in recent years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far a downsizing scenario has emerged : most massive galaxies ( @xmath2 ) had faster evolution at high redshift , with about 50% of their mass already assembled at @xmath3 ; instead , the mass assembly in less massive galaxies continues up to low redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these analysis use multicolor catalogs , and the gsm estimates are inferred from the comparison between spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and libraries of synthetic spectra .",
    "assumptions and systematics affect these estimates and the derived gsmf . among the others ,",
    "systematics originate from the assumed ingredients in the building of the library of synthetic spectra ( e.g. stellar population models , initial mass function ( imf ) , sfr histories , reddening ) . furthermore",
    ", as the @xmath4 ratio depends from the spectral type , the selection band could affect the gsmf determination ( for a detailed description of this problem see the related section and @xcite ) .    to discuss the impact of these uncertainties",
    ", we use the latest version of the goods  music multi - wavelength catalog , covering 14 bands from u to @xmath5 band ( santini et al .",
    "submitted ) .",
    "we show how the assumptions on the stellar population models and imf affect the results . using a 4.5@xmath0-selected sample ( @xmath6 )",
    ", we also show a comparison between gsmfs obtained using different selection bands ( @xmath7 and 4.5@xmath0 ) .",
    "the procedure adopted to obtain the gsms is described in detail in @xcite . in this section",
    "we show how the inferred masses change adopting the same initial conditions ( salpeter imf @xcite , metallicity and age grids , etc ... ) but different simple stellar population tracks . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we show the comparison between masses obtained using the bruzual & charlot 2003 , maraston 2005 @xcite and charlot & bruzual 2007 @xcite models ( elsewhere bc03 , mr05 and cb07 ) .",
    "the continuos lines of different colors indicate isodensity contours ( 0.01,0.1,0.3,0.7 of the maximal density ) .",
    "as expected , the masses obtained with mr05 and cb07 are on average lower than those obtained with bc03 @xcite . however , as it is shown in the redshift bin 0.4 - 0.8 , the ratio between cb07 and bc03 shows a dependence with the mass itself .",
    "masses obtained from bc03 models are higher than the cb07 ones of 0.3 dex at @xmath8 , and of 0.05 dex at @xmath2 .",
    "instead , the mr05 model gives masses in average lower than those from bc03 of a constant amount ( @xmath9 dex ) with the exception of a small group of objects at @xmath2 .",
    "in the higher redshift bins the mass range covered is smaller , and this makes the effect described above less evident . these systematic in the mass estimates cause different shapes in gsmfs and affect their slopes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the result is a shallower gsmf for the cb07 models and a steeper one for mr05 with respect to the determination obtained using the bc03 models .",
    "however , the general trend of fast evolution at high redshift for the most massive galaxies ( @xmath2 ) is observed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .     .",
    "bottom : comparison of the gsmf obtained with a chabrir imf ( blue continuos curve and points ) and with a salpeter one ( red dashed line and points ) . ]",
    "we also tested how the gsmf changes under different assumptions of the imf .",
    "in particular we adopt the chabrier @xcite and the salpeter imfs , the former being steeper at low stellar masses than the latter .",
    "this different shape causes a systematic in the gsms as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . here , in the upper panels , we compare masses obtained with our standard recipes and cb07 libraries , but with the two different choice of imf .",
    "the masses obtained using a chabrier imf are in average 0.24 dex lower than those obtained adopting a salpeter imf , and this effect is totally independent from the range of redshift and mass probed . as a consequence",
    "the gsmfs have the same shape , but the one obtained with a chabrier imf is shifted at lower masses of the same amount above mentioned , as is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the effects described in the previous section depend on different assumptions of the library ingredients . here , we focus on the selection effects of our sample .",
    "the use of a magnitude limited sample does not translate into a well defined , sharp limit in stellar mass , as the m / l ratio depends from the galaxy spectral type . in the case of a @xmath7-magnitude limited catalog , the sample can be complete for early type galaxies and moderately obscured star - forming ones , while it could miss very dusty star - forming galaxies , as widely discussed in @xcite . as result , the @xmath7-selected goods",
    " music sample could be affected by this kind of incompleteness over redshift @xmath10 ( see fig . 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "this problem could be alleviated by a 4.5 @xmath0-selection , which probes longer wavelengths less affected by dust extinction at these redshifts .",
    "adding the objects selected in the @xmath11 m band , but fainter in @xmath12 , we find a population of highly absorbed , dusty galaxies at @xmath13 of relatively low masses .",
    "the effect on gsmf is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , showing the comparison of the gsmf obtained from @xmath7 ( blue dotted - lines and empty circle points ) and 4.5 @xmath0 ( red dashed - lines and empty triangular points ) sample .",
    "we find that this new selection does not increase the gsmf at higher masses and that very dusty galaxies do not give a relevant contribution to the amount of stellar mass at all redshift considered here . at lower masses , in the redshift bins between 1.6 and 3",
    ", it improves the statistics , and although it does not change the results , it helps given a more solid constraint to the determination of @xmath14 parameter of the schechter function .",
    "this contribution becomes essential in the determination of the @xmath14 parameter in the higher redshift bin .",
