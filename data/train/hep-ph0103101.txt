    "the meson spectroscopy as the theory of bound states of quarks , and the phenomenology of the regge trajectories ( rts ) are important and interdependent subjects of investigation in particle physics @xcite .    at the present time",
    ", qcd is commonly considered the true theory of the strong interaction describing all processes in the hadron world , including the mesonic spectroscopy @xcite . however , being a nonlinear theory with local colour gauge symmetry , qcd is quite complicated from the computational point of view and corresponding methods of calculations require great efforts in additional assumptions and ideas .",
    "in contrast to qed , simple and reliable methods of calculations are still missing in qcd . from our point of view , the main puzzle is that any acceptable and well established description of quarks and gluons explaining the hadronization on large distances , where the confinement of quarks and gluons takes place , has not been found yet . on the other hand",
    ", one may expect that a theoretical description of colorless hadrons considered as bound states of quarks and gluons , when the confinement is taken into account and the averaging over all non - observable color degrees of freedom is performed , can lead to a physical picture , where the quarks and gluons are realized in the form of some phenomenological `` bricks '' .",
    "we suppose that a successful guess of the structure of these `` bricks '' in the confinement region can result , particularly , in a qualitatively correct description of the basic features of the meson spectrum .",
    "our guess is that the analytic confinement realizes these `` bricks '' .",
    "following this idea , in the present paper we consider the meson spectroscopy within the theory of bound states of quarks and gluons .",
    "our aim is to show within a simple relativistic quantum field model that the basic features of experimentally observed meson spectrum ( see , e.g. @xcite ) can be qualitatively explained by the analytic confinement of quarks and gluons .",
    "the basic dynamic characteristics of spectrum of all mesons considered bound states of quarks and gluons ( in contrast to the relations of the @xmath0 flavor symmetry ) can be listed as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - quarks and gluons are confined ;    - glueballs are bound states of massless gluons , i.e. they are completely relativistic systems ;    - the masses of mesons are larger than the sum of masses of the constituent quarks ;    - the rts of different families of mesonic orbital excitations are quite close to linear and their slopes practically coincide .",
    "it means that the slope is an universal parameter which is defined by the general nature of quark - gluon interaction . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    obviously , these characteristics can not be obtained in the framework of any local quantum field theory , where the constituent particles , quarks and gluons , are described by standard dirac and klein - gordon equations . from the common point of view",
    "the confinement plays the first role in understanding and explaining of this picture .",
    "the point is how to realize mathematically the conception of confinement in specific theoretical formalism ?",
    "the standard theoretical calculations leading to linear rts of mesonic bound states of quarks and gluons are based on the following assumptions .",
    "first , the quarks are accepted as ordinary fermions interacting by means of gluons .",
    "some argumentations including lattice calculations of the nonlinear qcd gluon dynamics are given to get a particular infrared behavior of the gluon propagator ( @xmath1 for @xmath2 ) which results in a linear increasing potential between quarks in three - dimensional space @xmath3 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "exactly this infrared behavior is interpreted as the quark confinement .",
    "second , one of three - dimensional reductions of the relativistic bethe - salpeter equation is used . for this purpose",
    "it is necessary to overcome some mathematical problems caused by the singularity of the gluon kernel and an ambigously defined choice of particular reduction of the relativistic two - body bethe - salpeter equation ( see , for example , @xcite ) . as a result",
    "a relativized scrdinger equation is obtained in @xmath4-space to estimate the meson masses including higher orbital excitations . hereby , the kinetic energy of the quarks looks like @xmath5 and the potential energy increases linearly .",
    "the most essential part of the two - body hamiltonian takes the form @xmath6    in the present paper we demonstrate another possible mechanism explaining the above mentioned characteristics of mesonic spectrum , including the origin of linear rts . in doing so , we use a simple relativistic quantum - field model of two scalar particles ( the prototypes of constituent `` quarks '' and intermediate `` gluons '' ) with the analytic confinement .",
    "our approach is based on the following assumptions :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - the analytic confinement takes place , it means that propagators of `` quarks '' and `` gluons '' are entire analytic functions of the first order on the complex momentum @xmath7-plane ;    - the interaction is described by the yukawa type lagrangian ;    - the coupling constant binding the `` quarks '' with `` gluons '' is small ;    - final bound states of `` quarks '' are described by the relativistic bethe - salpeter equation in one-``gluon '' exchange without using any three - dimensional reduction .",

    "particularly , the self - dual homogeneous vacuum gluon field in qcd results in the analytic confinement of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "the model of induced quark currents based on this vacuum gluon field describes correctly the experimental data @xcite .",
    "this paper is aimed to demonstrate the mathematical sketch of calculations of the two - body bound - state spectrum within the bethe - salpeter equation within simple qft models , when the analytic confinement takes place in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "these simple relativistic models are based on physically transparent hypotheses and can be treated by simple analytic methods .",
    "we claim that the analytic confinement is the basic underlying `` brick '' leading to the qualitatively correct description of main characteristics of the meson spectra . in any case",
    "we believe that our models represent certain theoretical interest because they clarify the underlying physical principles of the meson spectrum .    for simplicity",
    ", we deal with two possible versions of the analytic confinement . in the first model the propagators of `` quarks '' and `` gluons '' are pure gaussian exponents , i.e. @xmath8 , where the parameter @xmath9 represents the `` radius '' of confinement . from physical point of view",
    "this model is important because the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the relativistic bethe - salpeter equation within one - particle exchange approximation can be found explicitly and the obtained rts are purely linear .",
    "one can say that this model can be considered a `` relativistic oscillator '' , i.e. it is a relativistic generalization of the quantum nonrelativistic oscillator with equidistant spectra .",
    "the second model comes from a natural physical picture of standard particles with a relevant scale of mass @xmath10 .",
    "it is supposed that the analytic confinement characterized by the scale @xmath11 makes the propagators of particles ( `` quarks '' and `` gluons '' ) entire analytic functions . as a result",
    "there are two physical parameters : the scale of confinement @xmath11 and the mass of quark @xmath10 .",
    "an interesting problem is to investigate the dependence of the meson spectrum on the relative parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we shall show that this model describes qualitatively well all above listed dynamical characteristics of meson spectra .",
    "we consider the yukawa model of two interacting scalar fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 described by the following lagrangian in the euclidean space - time as follows @xmath15 the coupling constant @xmath16 is supposed to be sufficiently small .",
    "we postulate that the analytic confinement takes place here .",
    "it means , that propagators @xmath17 and @xmath18 of confined particles @xmath19 and @xmath20 are entire analytic functions in the complex @xmath7-plane so that the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 have no zeros at any finite complex @xmath23 . as a result",
    "the equations for free fields @xmath24 result only in the unique trivial solutions @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we call this property _ analytic confinement _ , i.e. the corresponding particles exist only in virtual states , so @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the _ virton fields _ ( see @xcite ) . one can say that these fields describe constituent particles , e.g. @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent scalar `` quarks '' and scalar `` gluons '' , correspondingly .",
    "as mentioned above , we deal with two simple versions of the analytic confinement .",

    "can be considered a relativistic `` oscillator '' because the corresponding bethe - salpeter equation can be solved exactly and the exact solution gives linear rts .",
    "we call this case _ the virton model_.    the second model implies that there exists a certain physical mechanism which generates analytic confinement of standard particles with the initial masses @xmath10 and @xmath29 .",
    "then , their propagators are given in more realistic forms @xmath30 the confinement region is characterized by the parameter @xmath11 . in the deconfinement limit @xmath31 one obtains the standard propagators of massive and massless scalar particles . within this model",
    "we want to analyze the influence of the parameter @xmath32 on the behavior of the meson spectrum .",
    "we call this case _ the scalar confinement model_.    `` two - quark '' bound states can be found in the following way .",
