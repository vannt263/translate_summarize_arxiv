    "the spatiotemporal patterns and transport of magnetic field in the photosphere are driven by the turbulent plasma flows in the solar convection zone .",
    "solar magnetic fields are observed in complex and hierarchical structures covering a wide range of scales that emerge and vanish on the time - scales of turbulent convective patterns .",
    "traditionally , they are classified by size and lifetime as patterns of granulation ( 1 mm , 0.2 h ) , mesogranulation ( 5 - 10 mm , 5 h ) and supergranulation ( 15 - 35 mm , 24 h ) .",
    "recently , the idea is emerging that meso and supergranulation are signatures of a collective interaction of granular cells @xcite .",
    "the continuous restructuring of surface magnetic fields by photospheric turbulent flows plays a key role in determining the topology and evolution of chromospheric and coronal magnetic fields , and may influence the triggering of eruptive solar events such as flares , coronal mass ejections or sudden disappearance of filaments @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite used space and ground observations to show that large - scale horizontal photospheric flows below and around a filament influence the formation and evolution of filaments , leading to destabilization of the coronal magnetic field .",
    "spectral line observations of the sun with high spatial resolution show small - scale bright points , with widths @xmath0 mm , located in the intergranular lanes .",
    "bright points are associated with localized regions of strong magnetic field and correspond to magnetic flux tubes of kilogauss field strength that stand nearly vertically in the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "some bright points exhibit the proper motions of convectively driven vortical flows created at the downdrafts where the plasma follows spiral paths and returns to the solar interior after cooling down @xcite .",
    "recent balloon - borne sunrise observations show @xmath1 vortices mm@xmath2 min@xmath3 , with a mean lifetime of 7.9 min and a standard deviation of 3.2 min @xcite .",
    "these magnetized vortex tubes have been predicted by the theory of magnetoconvection @xcite and observed in 3d radiative / compressible mhd simulations @xcite .",
    "photospheric vortex structures with high concentration of magnetic field provide an important path for energy and momentum transfer from the convection zone into the chromosphere @xcite and may be relevant for chromospheric - coronal heating @xcite .",
    "a number of observational and theoretical works have applied the lagrangian approach to trace the flow of bright points and the pattern of the magnetic network .",
    "@xcite measured the horizontal flow field on the solar surface using the technique of local correlation tracking ( lct ) on a 28 min time sequence of white - light images of the solar optical universal polarimeter instrument onboard the spacelab2 .",
    "they showed that insight into the relationship between flows and magnetic fields is acquired by calculating the flow of passive test particles , called `` corks '' , that are originally distributed uniformly in the flow field .",
    "the cork paths , representing the lagrangian tracers of the pathlines of the flow , congregate at the same locations of the magnetic network .",
    "a simplified kinematic model of convection at the solar surface was developed by @xcite to interpret observations and predict the evolution of magnetic fields .",
    "they compared the cork patterns of the simulated flow with the cork patterns of the observed magnetic network , and discussed the extent to which magnetic flux tubes can be regarded as moving passively with the large - scale photospheric flow .",
    "@xcite used the g - band images of the swedish vacuum solar telescope to show that bright points are arranged in linear structures , called `` filigrees '' , located in the lanes between neighboring granule cells and to measure the motion of bright points using an object tracking technique ; comparison with a 2d simulation of horizontal motions of magnetic flux elements in response to solar granulation flows shows that the observed velocities and spatial distribution of the bright points are consistent with passive advection of corks by the solar granulation flow .",
    "@xcite reconstructed the 3d velocity field of a single supergranular cell from the spectrometer data of the interferometric bidimensional spectrometer , and used the tracking of corks to show that a divergence structure is created by a compact region of constant up - flow close to the cell centre , and isolated regions of strong convergent down - flow are nearby or cospatial with extended clusters of bright caii wing features forming the knots of the magnetic network .",
    "@xcite applied the coherent structure tracking ( cst ) algorithm to track granules and analyze large - scale photospheric flows related to an extended filament in the active region ar 11106 using the @xmath4 image of the themis telescope and the euv imager ( aia ) of solar dynamic observatory .",
    "they showed that diverging flows inside the supergranules may be similar in and out of the filament channel .",
    "in addition , they identify converging flows , corresponding to accumulation of corks , around the footpoints or barbs located at the edges of the euv filament .",
    "the frequent euv brightenings suggest the occurrence of reconnections of the magnetic field lines of the flux tube with the environment at the convergence points at the edges of the euv filament channel .",
    "there is observational evidence of anomalous transport and turbulence in photospheric flows and magnetic fields . @xcite and @xcite applied the percolation theory to report sub - diffusion of magnetic elements in the photosphere .",
    "@xcite used a 70 min sequence of g - band image of the swedish vacuum solar telescope on 5-october-1995 to show that the transport of bright points near the disk center is subdiffusive due to the trapping of walkers at the stagnation points in the fractal intercellular pattern ; the distribution of waiting times at the trap sites obeys a lvy ( power - law ) distribution .",
    "@xcite applied subsonic filtering to the data of @xcite to report super - diffusion and show that the spatiotemporal scaling of the bright point dynamics indeed indicates the presence of turbulence in the intergranular lanes .",
    "@xcite used a 32 min sequence of g - band and ca ii k - line intensity measurements of the dunn solar telescope on 28-may-2009 , at the disk center of size 32 mm @xmath5 32 mm , to investigate high - frequency fluctuations in both photosphere and chromosphere ; their noise - corrected g - band spectrum for @xmath6 mhz shows a power law with exponent @xmath7 , consistent with the presence of turbulent motions .",
    "moreover , they showed that the g - band spectral power in the 25 - 100 mhz range is concentrated at the locations of magnetic bright points in the intergranular lanes and is highly intermittent in time , being characterized by a positive kurtosis , which implies that the fluctuations have non - gaussian probability distribution functions ( pdf ) with broad tails indicative of turbulence .",
    "@xcite showed that the noise - filtered power spectrum of the hinode / sot data with a sequence of 80 min on 5-march-2007 , in the internetwork near the sun center of size 20 mm @xmath5 20 mm , presents a scaling range of @xmath8 mhz with characteristic power law exponents of -1.56 for g - band and of -4.00 for h - line , confirming the presence of turbulent fluctuations . by integrating the hinode / sot g - band spectra in the range 32 - 53 mhz , they identified the sites of increased g - band power with the location of g - band bright points .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used the images of new solar telescope of big bear solar observatory to report super - diffusion and turbulent pair dispersion of bright points in active region plage , quiet - sun , and coronal hole .",
    "the aim of this paper is to apply eulerian and lagrangian tools to detect coherent structures in images of photospheric turbulent flows .",
    "first , we apply the eulerian approach to compute the q - criterion and distinguish regions of the plasma flow dominated by the deformation and vortical coherent structures @xcite .",
    "next , we apply the tool of lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) to determine the repelling and attracting material lines that organize the transport of plasma flow .",
    "the term `` lagrangian '' refers to flows defined by the fluid motion instead of an instantaneous snapshot ( eulerian ) ; the term `` coherent '' refers to the distinguished stability of these structures compared to other nearby material lines / surfaces .",
    "there is a growing interest to adopt the lcs approach @xcite to improve the understanding of transport in complex flows such as planetary atmosphere @xcite , oceans @xcite , and cardiovascular system @xcite .",
    "a number of papers have studied lcs in complex plasma flows for thermonuclear applications @xcite and astrophysical applications @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply the backward finite - time lyapunov exponents ( b - ftle ) to study the attracting lcs of the photospheric turbulence .",
    "we show that , like the `` corks '' , the b - ftle is able to trace the patterns of the magnetic network .",
    "moreover , it gives a quantitative measure of the local rate of contraction / expansion of the photospheric flow .",
    "our study is based on a 12 h high - resolution sequence of velocity images ( cadence @xmath9 ) of photospheric flow derived from the hinode - sot magnetograms , from 12-dec-2006 14:24 ut to 13-dec-2006 02:24 ut , by selecting a unipolar plage area of size 12.4 mm @xmath5 12.4 mm ( @xmath10 ) near the active region ar 10930 ( yeates et al .",

    "it is worth pointing out that there are uncertainties in the correlation tracking that do not fully resolve the velocity fields in either space or time .",
    "the detailed description of the data reduction procedure is given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the flct method involves a number of optimum parameters which are determined by an autocorrelation analysis in order to maximize frame - to - frame correlations and ensure robustness in the velocity estimate . in view of the reduction of noise by averaging in the tracking procedure",
    ", the actual velocity patterns of the photospheric flow might be more complicated than the `` proxy '' .",
    "@xcite showed that the build - up of magnetic gradients in solar corona can be inferred directly from the photospheric velocity data , without recourse to magnetic field extrapolation .",
    "they established the correspondence of the network of quasi - separatrix layers @xcite to the repelling lcs in the photospheric velocity . in this paper , we extend the analysis of @xcite to establish the correspondence of the network of high magnetic flux concentration to the attracting lcs in the photospheric velocity .",

    "the vorticity tensor @xmath14 is the anti - symmetric part of @xmath18 .",
    "for example , the deformation calculated using the ulysses data shows that the magnetic tension causes local stretching of solar wind plasma elements mostly along the direction of the average magnetic field , whereas the solar wind vorticity tends to become perpendicular to the mean radial direction at large heliospheric distances @xcite .",

    "note that the pdf of the q - criterion shows a strong asymmetry skewed towards negative values , which indicates that in the plage region under study the photospheric turbulent flow is dominated by the strain - rate field .",
    "this situation is similar to a laboratory experiment of the turbulence - flame interaction , where the flame surface straining is dominated by the deformation whereas the role of the vorticity is to curve the flame surface creating wrinkles @xcite .",
    "the mean values of eulerian coherent structures for four instances are summarized in table 1 .",

    "a material line is a smooth curve of fluid particles advected by the velocity field @xcite . these attracting and repelling material lines are the analogous of stable and unstable manifolds of time - independent fields @xcite .",

    "two particles are said to straddle a manifold if the line segment connecting them crosses the manifold .",
    "the maximum ftle typically has high values on the stable manifold in forward - time , since nearby trajectories straddling the manifold will experience exponential divergence when they approach the saddle point . similarly , the ftle field exhibits a local maximizing curve ( ridge ) along the unstable manifold in backward - time dynamics , since trajectories straddling the unstable manifold diverge exponentially when they approach the saddle point in reversed - time .",
    "thus , ridges in the forward - time ftle field mark the stable manifolds of hyperbolic points and ridges in the backward - time ftle field mark the unstable manifolds .",
    "analogously , for a time - dependent velocity field , regions of maximum material stretching generate ridges in the ftle field .",
    "thus , the repelling material lines ( finite - time stable manifolds ) produce ridges in the maximum ftle field in the forward - time system and attracting material lines ( finite - time unstable manifolds ) produce ridges in the backward - time system , as seen in figures [ fig lcs ] and [ fig lcs2 ] .",
    "in this paper , we showed that eulerian coherent structures and lagrangian coherent structures give very different information of the dynamics and structure of astrophysical plasma flows .",
    "eulerian coherent structures give instantaneous information of plasma dynamics and structure at a given time , whereas lagrangian coherent structures account for the integrated effect of plasma dynamics and structure in a finite - time interval .",
    "arguably , instantaneous quantities may be considered inappropriate to understand inherently transient phenomenon since such quantities may not properly convey the integrated behavior of constantly changing flow .",
    "lcs typically account for such integrated behavior more naturally by considering the integrated fluid motion to reveal organizing flow features .    in the context of photospheric turbulence , we showed in figure [ fig euler ] that the eulerian analysis is able to differentiate two types of coherent structures arising from either deformation or vorticity .",

    ", we extended the observational study by @xcite of lagrangian coherent structures in the photospheric velocity to show that in addition to the correspondence of the network of quasi - separatrix layers in the repelling lcs demonstrated by @xcite , there is a correspondence of the network of high magnetic flux concentration to the attracting lcs in the photospheric flows , confirmed by both observations and numerical simulations .",
    "hence , the repelling and attracting lcs of the photospheric velocity provide complementary informations of the local dynamics and topology of solar magnetic fields .",
    "although the corks coincide with the network of magnetic flux , they are not the best way to find the transport barriers and the directions of the flow convergence .",
    "we showed that the attracting lcs are more suitable for these tasks because they trace continuous curves ( material lines ) that are the explicit structures potentially responsible for observed physical patterns and at the same time measure the local rate of contraction / expansion in the flow .",
    "while eulerian coherent structures provide useful insights of the snapshot of the photospheric flows , they fail to reveal the fine structures of the transport barriers and the local dynamics of the flows that are readily provided by the repelling and attracting lagrangian coherent structures .",
