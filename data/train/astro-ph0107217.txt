    "if a central source of hard x - rays and soft gamma rays is surrounded by thomson - thick scattering clouds , then the electrons in the cloud will be heated to the compton temperature of the incident radiation , and hard x - rays will be backscattered .",
    "radiation that passes through these hot scattering clouds will have their soft x rays scattered to higher energies @xcite .",
    "soft gamma - rays that pass through the cloud will be subject to pair - production through @xmath0 interactions @xcite .",
    "these pairs can annihilate to form a broadened 0.511 mev line within the hot relativistic plasma , or will diffuse into the interstellar medium to produce sites of localized annihilation radiation .",
    "the compton - scattered radiation is detected later at lower flux levels @xcite .",
    "such systems provide potential targets for _",
    "integral_.    a simple generalization of standard compactness arguments @xcite for an illuminated cloud characterizes the condition when backscattered pair - production interactions must be considered . the process of @xmath2 pair production attenuation begins to be important when @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number density of @xmath5-ray photons with energies @xmath6 mev , @xmath7 is the @xmath8-ray luminosity , @xmath9 is the radius of the cloud , and @xmath10 is the pair production cross section . because @xmath11 near threshold , a system is compact when @xmath12 ergs s@xmath13 cm@xmath13 .",
    "we generalize this result to determine when a cloud , illuminated by a @xmath8-ray source a distance @xmath15 from the cloud , becomes compact .",
    "the compactness condition depends on the width @xmath16 of the illuminating photon front . if @xmath17 , then the number density of the scattered radiation field is @xmath18 , whereas if @xmath19 , then @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , an illuminated cloud with @xmath21 is compact if @xmath22 for grbs which produce photon fronts @xmath23 - 100 lt - s , thomson - thick clouds with radii @xmath24 cm located @xmath25 cm away from the grb source will be compact when @xmath26 ergs s@xmath13 .",
    "smaller gamma - ray powers are required for persistent sources . in this paper",
    ", we focus on grb / cloud interactions , in view of evidence @xcite that such sources have highly metal enriched clouds with large column densities in their vicinity .",
    "a wave of photons impinging on a cloud located @xmath27 cm from the grb source will photoionize and compton - scatter the ambient electrons to energies characteristic of the incident @xmath5 rays @xcite . for a plasma cloud with a width of @xmath28 lt - s , radiation effects must be treated locally .",
    "besides making pairs through @xmath0 attenuation with backscattered photons , the nonthermal electrons and pairs will compton scatter successive waves of photons , thereby modifying the incident spectrum .",
    "grbs produce a temporally - evolving spectrum of nonthermal synchrotron photons with energy @xmath29 that can be parameterized by the equation @xmath30\\ ;    \\label{phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the photon energy of the peak of the @xmath32 spectrum , @xmath33 is the peak spectral power , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the @xmath32 spectral indices at energies @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively . the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend upon time @xmath40 , and @xmath41 during the prompt @xmath5-ray luminous phase of a grb . as nonthermal synchrotron photons from a grb impinge on the atoms in the cloud , electrons will be compton - scattered by the high - energy radiation .",
    "the time scale for an electron to be compton - scattered by a photon is @xmath42 , assuming that all compton scattering events occur in the thomson limit .",
    "the klein - nishina decline in the compton cross section will increase this estimate by a factor of @xmath43 - 3 , depending on the incident spectrum .",
    "most of the electrons in the cloud will therefore be scattered to high energies during a very luminous ( @xmath44 ) grb , or when the cloud is located at @xmath45 .",
    "electrons are compton - scattered on the thomson time scale to form a hard spectrum that turns over at kinetic energies of @xmath46min(@xmath47 ) kev . for a grb with @xmath41 , most of the kinetic energy is therefore carried by nonthermal electrons with energies of @xmath48 kev .",
    "successive waves of photons that pass through this plasma will continue to compton - scatter the nonthermal electrons . only the lowest energy photons ,",
    "however , will be strongly affected by the radiative transfer because both the compton scattering cross section and energy change per scattering is largest for the lowest energy photons .     and",
    "@xmath49 , are shown by the thin and thick curves for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the nonthermal electrons are approximated by a thermal distribution with temperatures of 100 kev ( thin histograms ) and 300 kev ( thick histograms ) , and thomson depths @xmath52 @xmath53 as labeled .",
    "photon spectral indices @xmath54 calculated at 50 kev are 0.54 ( @xmath55 kev , @xmath56 ) , 0.45 ( @xmath57 kev , @xmath56 ) , 0.28 ( @xmath55 kev , @xmath53 ) , and 0.16 ( @xmath57 kev , @xmath53 ) .",

    ", we approximate the hard nonthermal electron spectrum by a thermal distribution with temperatures of 100 and 300  kev , and neglect pair production processes . the electron temperature is chosen so that the mean electron kinetic energy is less than the compton temperature of the incident radiation .",
    "these calculations show that the lowest energy photons of the primary synchrotron spectrum are most strongly scattered , and that the  line - of - death \" problem of the synchrotron shock model of grbs @xcite can be solved by radiation transfer effects through a hot scattering cloud with @xmath58 1 - 2 .",
    "radiation transfer effects by intervening clouds may likewise harden the intrinsic spectrum of other hard x - ray and gamma - ray sources .",
    "following the initial wave of photons , successive photon fronts also encounter the back - scattered radiation , which will lead to @xmath0 attenuation and pair production @xcite . here",
    "we use the analytic model of @xcite , eq .  ( [ phi ] ) , for the spectral and temporal evolution of the grb spectrum .",

    "we calculate the space- and time - dependent @xmath0 opacity due to radiation backscattered by the cloud into the path of the prompt radiation , and the corresponding rate of pair production . for this purpose ,",
    "we assume that the cloud material is ionized instantly at the onset of the grb , and that the grb radiation instantly heats the free electrons to the compton equilibrium temperature .",
    "the formalism used to calculate the @xmath0 opacity is largely analogous to the calculation of @xcite for the case of @xmath0 attenuation in blazars .",
    "the effect of compton scattering on the transmitted grb radiation is evaluated using an appropriate average of the effective compton scattering cross section over the thermal distribution of electrons and pairs at any given radius .    , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",

    "[ fig2 ] shows an example of such a calculation with typical grb parameters @xcite .",
    "the efficiency for making pairs in this example ( defined as the fraction of incident radiation energy transformed into pairs ) is 0.43 % .",
    "this pair efficiency is large enough that grbs could make a substantial contribution to the annihilation glow of the milky way , which would be concentrated near sites of an earlier grb .",
    "[ fig2 ] indicates that although the actual pair efficiency and the relative number of pairs versus background thermal electrons ( @xmath72  @xmath62 ) may be rather low , both the effects of @xmath0 attenuation of high - energy photons and compton upscattering of low - energy photons can become quite significant .",
    "here we outline a derivation of pulse scattering and echo effects that occur when a photon front passes through a scattering cloud , with thomson depth @xmath73 @xcite , that lies along the line - of - sight to the observer .",
    "photons that are scattered by an intervening cloud will be detected later at a reduced flux .",
    "following the treatment of @xcite , let @xmath74 represent the differential number of photons with dimensionless photon energy @xmath75 between @xmath75 and @xmath76 that are directed into solid angle interval @xmath77 in the direction @xmath78 at time @xmath79 is the frame of the emitter .",

    "the basic features of these calculations can be understood by noting that the scattered flux persists for a time @xmath104 and that the ratio of the scattered flux to the direct flux is @xmath105 for @xmath73 .",
    "an interesting implication is that the scattered flux is comparable in intensity to the direct flux only when the scattering clouds are within a distance @xmath106 of the central source .",
    "when the clouds are extremely optically thick with @xmath107 , the central source is strongly attenuated and the scattered radiation will make a larger contribution .",
    "we have considered three potentially observable effects of gamma - ray sources that illuminate nearby thomson - thick clouds :    1 .",
    "spectral hardening of radiation that passes through compton - heated gas ; 2 .",
    "formation of pairs when @xmath5 rays interact with backscattered photons ; and 3 .   scattered flux that is detected at later times .",
    "we @xcite have proposed that the first effect could account for unusually hard spectra detected in @xmath108 - 10% of grbs , thereby explaining exceptions to the nonthermal synchrotron shock model of grbs . _ integral _ could observe such effects in serendipitous grbs . given a full sky grb rate of @xmath109 yr@xmath13",

    "searches for this effect can be made through spectral analyses of these grbs .",
    "production of e@xmath112-e@xmath113 pairs through the second effect will occur in the vicinity of compact @xmath5-ray sources that have large amounts of gas surrounding them .",

    "given the additional @xmath117% efficiency for converting the kinetic energy of grbs into @xmath5 rays , we see that grb sources produce a time - averaged injection rate of @xmath118-@xmath119 e@xmath112 s@xmath13 into the milky way that could contribute substantially to the galactic 0.511 mev intensity of the galaxy ( dermer & murphy , these proceedings ) . because of the rarity and energy of grbs , these would most likely be detected as localized hot spots of annihilation radiation surrounded by a hypernova remnant signaling an earlier grb .",
    "compton echoes from distant scattering clouds may be detectable in the afterglow phase of grbs @xcite , and reverberation effects due to thomson scattering in heavily obscured seyfert 2 galaxies could be observable with _ integral_. as we have seen , scattered fluxes from short pulses of high - energy radiation would be difficult to detect from clouds in the vicinity of grb sources unless @xmath120 .",
