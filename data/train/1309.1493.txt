    "the structure and behavior of materials at the nanoscale are both of fundamental and technological importance and are particularly relevant to the understanding of supported nanoscale catalysts .",
    "this challenging problem is complicated by the fact that nano - scale properties differ from those of condensed systems , especially at high temperature .",
    "their unusual thermodynamic properties have been widely recognized at the structural,@xcite catalytic,@xcite and spectroscopic@xcite level .",
    "they differ from the bulk since the thermodynamic limit does not apply for small @xmath0 , where @xmath0 refers to the number of atoms in the nanocluster .",
    "for example , cluster surface effects of @xmath1 are crucial and thus nano - scale systems are necessarily inhomogeneous . moreover ,",
    "statistical physics arguments imply that nano - scale systems exhibit substantial @xmath2 fluctuations in extensive physical quantities like total energy and charge , and hence @xmath3 fluctuations in local temperature .",
    "in addition supported nano - scale catalysts exhibit an intrinsic fluctuating , inhomogeneous structure referred to as dynamic structural disorder ( dsd).@xcite thus , in contrast to bulk materials , they have no well - defined  equilibrium structure , \" particularly at high temperatures .",
    "the presence of these intrinsic fluctuations suggest that it would be useful to examine their behavior from a dynamical perspective .",
    "this approach is in contrast to conventional surface science approaches typically based on time - independent structural properties .",
    "indeed , there has been a growing interest in such real - time approaches in recent years.@xcite dynamic effects have also been postulated to play a role in other treatments of catalysis , ranging from heterogeneous catalysis@xcite at surfaces and in the catalytic activity in biostructures .",
    "@xcite the difference in the treatment here is the emphasis on the effects of nano - scale dynamics on catalytic properties which are investigated using nudged - elastic - band ( neb ) transition state theory ( tst ) calculations .    our approach for modelling the effects of dsd is based on a concept dubbed picturesquely as  shake - rattle - and - roll \" ( srr ) .",
    "this approach was inspired by observations of unusual behavior in nanoscale supported pt and pt - alloy catalysts : in particular , x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) studies showed that small pt nano - clusters exhibit negative thermal expansion , anomalously large disorder , and temperature dependent shifts in xas threshold energies.@xcite these anomalous properties were subsequently explained by finite - temperature dft / md calculations , which showed that they are dynamical in origin , involving multiple time - scales.@xcite they include 1 ) fast bond vibrations ( i.e. , _ shaking _ ) 2 ) soft anharmonic or fluxional modes , particularly involving the nano - particle surface atoms ; and 3 ) librational motion of the center of mass ( cm ) , which is due to the thermal contact of the nano - clusters tethered to the support bonding sites .",
    "as discussed below , these cm dynamics are analogous to hindered 2-dimensional brownian motion . when combined with the stochastic thermal coupling to the support",
    ", these low - frequency modes induce a _",
    "rattle-_like motion in the system , typically at sub - thz frequencies . at longer time scales ( tens of ps for supported pt clusters on @xmath4-alumina at high temperatures ) , bonding to the support is transient . when those bonds break , the nano - clusters can then _ roll _ or slide to new positions on the support .",
    "the combined motion of many such clusters eventually leads to sintering , which typically reduces catalytic activity .",
    "this rattle - like motion has recently been interpreted as dynamic structural disorder , in contrast to static bond distortions or substitutional disorder typical in condensed systems . instead , the dsd is  non - equilibrium \" in character , in the sense that the system exhibits fluctuations from from mechanical and thermal equilibrium , even though , of course , the full system ( cluster plus support ) is in overall  thermal - equilibrium , \" with a well defined global temperature @xmath5 .",
    "thus the geometric structure of nano - clusters is amorphous and fluctuating , rather like that in a partly - melted solid .",
    "indeed , dsd affects the nano - cluster behavior through stochastic fluctuations in structure , cluster charge and center of mass position .",
    "these remarkable observations have motivated us to reinvestigate the structure and catalytic behavior of supported nanoscale catalysts in terms of their dynamic structure . to this end",
    ", we introduce the srr concept based on a combination of statistical mechanics , transient coupled - oscillator models , and real - time dft / md simulations .",
    "as discussed below , srr can explain the anomalous properties observed for supported nano - clusters , including both dsd and charge fluctuations . as an illustration we have applied this approach to calculations of both the interaction between the supported nanocatalysts and prototypical molecules , and their dissociation reaction paths .",
    "these show that the dsd provides a mechanism for increasing reaction rates .",
    "although still preliminary , the srr model offers tantalizing insights into dynamic mechanisms that contribute to catalytic processes .",
    "as noted in the introduction , thermal properties of nano - structures with relatively small @xmath0 differ substantially from those in macroscopic condensed matter due to finite - size effects enhanced by their poor thermal coupling to the support .",
    "in contrast to bulk systems , their mean energy @xmath6 is not sharply defined , but exhibits substantial energy fluctuations of order @xmath7 , @xcite leading to fluctuations in the local temperature ( or energy per particle ) of order @xmath8 .",
    "this effect is not immediately obvious since the global temperature @xmath5 is a constant throughout the system . to understand these results , we recount the classical arguments of statistical thermodynamics .",
    "we consider a nano - cluster with @xmath0 atoms weakly bound to a support at fixed temperature @xmath5 , which serves as a heat - bath .",
    "for simplicity of argument the cluster volume @xmath9 , charge @xmath10 , and composition can be regarded as fixed , but these contraints are not essential and will be relaxed below . due to contact with the support , which is in continuous thermal and vibrational motion , energy will fluctuate between the cluster and the support , with a probability distribution @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the net cluster entropy due to distinguishable configurations @xmath14 of the nano - cluster at energy @xmath15 .",
    "thermal equilibrium corresponds to the maximum probability or , equivalently , @xmath16 , i.e. , the helmholtz free energy .",
    "the mean total cluster energy @xmath6 is then fixed by the relation @xmath17 , and hence both the nano - cluster and the support have the same equilibrium temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the cluster entropy @xmath18 is additive in terms of the independent @xmath19 degrees of freedom in the cluster dynamics .",
    "in addition to the @xmath20 internal vibrational modes ( including both potential and kinetic degrees of freedom ) , the dynamics includes four additional degrees of freedom from the 2-d librational modes of the cm parallel to the support , and additional modes binding the cluster to it .",
    "the distribution @xmath21 is sharply peaked for large @xmath0 and approximately gaussian near the peak at @xmath6 .",
    "the mean square fluctuations @xmath22 are obtained from the 2nd derivative of the entropy @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is clearly @xmath24 since both the total energy @xmath15 and entropy @xmath18 of the cluster are extensive . at high temperatures , where equipartition is valid , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . thus the energy fluctuations are given by @xmath27 and similarly since @xmath28 ,",
    "fluctuations in the internal temperature of the cluster are @xmath29 .",
    "the effect is rather like that of a fluctuating thermostat for which any non - linear effects ( e.g. , reaction rates ) on temperature do not cancel .",
    "consequently , one may expect substantial dsd effects on reaction rates .",
    "for example , for @xmath0=20 at 600 k , @xmath6 is distributed within a few tenths of an ev of the mean @xmath30 3 ev , and @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , the thermal fluctuations of the substrate itself are negligible .",
    "this statistical argument suggests why finite temperature dft / md approaches may be more efficient than full canonical ensemble sampling for calculating the physical properties of nanoclusters , since they naturally probe the range of accessible phase space within a few @xmath32 of @xmath6 over a time - scale comparable to the periods of vibrational and librational motion .",
    "the above arguments can be generalized for other conserved physical quantities , for example total volume @xmath33 , net electronic charge @xmath34 , chemical composition , etc .",
    ", where the subscript @xmath35 refers to the support .",
    "to this end one must generalize the calculations of accessible states in terms of @xmath36 with varying @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc .",
    "these additional physical quantities are stabilized by those from the support bath , so that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pressure , @xmath39 the chemical potential , @xmath40 is the number of electrons in the cluster , and @xmath41 the number of atoms of species @xmath42 .",
    "since quantities like @xmath9 and @xmath10 are extensive , one also expects their fluctuations to be of order @xmath43 . the charge ( and hence chemical potential )",
    "fluctuations , are important to explain the variation of the fermi energy with temperature in the xas studies .",
    "due to the strength of coulomb forces and the importance of oxidation states in many catalytic reactions , these charge fluctuations may play a key role in controlling nano - scale properties and chemical reaction rates .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of tethered pt nano - clusters can be understood in terms of a  transient coupled oscillator model . \"",
    "that is , we consider the internal vibrations with respect to fluctuating instantaneous - equilibrium structures , which is presumably valid over a ps time - scale long compared to the vibrational periods .",
    "the dominant modes of the system coupled to the support thus consist of : i ) vibrational modes ; ii ) soft and fluxional modes , particularly close to the cluster surface ; and iii ) cm librational modes , i.e. , soft modes about which the cluster center of mass fluctuates . for pt ,",
    "the vibrational modes are of thz scale , while the soft and librational modes are sub - thz .",
    "the model is transient , since anharmonicity and bond - breaking can be substantial , and hence the characteristic modes of oscillation fluctuate .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities of interest can be obtained from the free energy e.g. , @xmath44 averaged over several such models , each of which can be calculated over sufficiently short ( e.g. , ps time - scale ) time - intervals within a quasi - harmonic approximation using the relation,@xcite @xmath45.\\ ] ] here @xmath46 is the total density of modes per unit frequency and @xmath47 is the electronic energy at the transient mean atomic positions .",
    "the thermodynamic average @xmath48 is given by the same expression with @xmath47 replaced by @xmath49 and @xmath46 by @xmath50 .",
    "this approach is efficient , since despite the fluctuations in structure , the average spectrum @xmath51 is relatively stable .",
    "the term @xmath52 is important since it contains the transient effects of charge fluctuations and affects changes in potential energy that dominate the reaction paths .",
    "the support provides both a heat bath and charge reservoir at fixed @xmath5 which give rise to stochastic cm motion and dsd .",
    "since we are primarily interested in catalytic behavior at high - temperatures , we focus our discussion here to the classical limit with mean phonon occupations @xmath53 . at 600",
    "k this limit is a reasonable approximation for pt which has a debye - temperature of @xmath54 k and an equivalent debye frequency of 5.2 thz . in this limit @xmath55 this statistical approach can also be directly compared to experiment , since observed physical properties are usually defined as averages over a statistical ensemble , and are equivalent to time - averages over a long time interval sufficient to cover the accessible phase space .",
    "low frequency modes are important since @xmath56 varies inversely with @xmath57 .",
    "however , the effect of breathing modes is expected to be small since for a 3-d system @xmath58 at long - wavelengths . from the identity @xmath59",
    ", we obtain a mean energy @xmath25 at high temperatures , consistent with the equipartition theorem .",
    "this energy includes contributions from the 2-d librational motion in the @xmath60 plane , which can be approximated by low frequency ( sub thz ) vibrational modes of the cm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vibdis ] ) .",
    "thus the mean stochastic librational kinetic energy @xmath61 .",
    "this result is the analog of brownian motion , the difference being that such motion is hindered and 2-dimensional in character in nanoparticles tethered to the support .",
    "this stochastic cm motion is crucial to the origin of dsd and drives non - equlibrium fluctuations in the internal structure .",

    "our analysis suggests that it may be important to treat the behavior of reactant molecules on the dynamically fluctuating surface of a nano - cluster , e.g. , with our srr model , rather than on selected static structures .",
    "thus , the slow fluctuating modes of both the cluster and the reactant molecules can couple , resulting in an statistical ensemble of reaction barriers and reaction rates .",
