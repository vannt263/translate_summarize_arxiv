    "the seminal work by ebbesen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the study of extraordinary transmission phenomena through sub - wavelength apertures has emerged during the last decade as one of the most fascinating research areas in electromagnetics and optics , with a wealth of subtle physical aspects and potentially disruptive application perspectives to data storage , imaging , sensing , and lithography technologies . the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite ( and references therein ) for recent tutorials and reviews of the well - established physical aspects and the as yet unsettled issues .    for",
    "the slit geometries of direct interest for the present investigation , most of the available results @xcite , @xcite pertain to the transverse - magnetic ( tm ) polarization ( i.e. , magnetic field directed along the slits ) , for which the enhanced transmission is mediated by a _ propagating _ waveguide mode ( with no cut - off frequency ) supported by the slits . comparatively much less effort ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) has been devoted to the transverse - electric ( te ) case ( i.e. , electric field directed along the slits ) , for which the slit waveguide mode does instead exhibit a nonzero cut - off frequency , below which only _ evanescent _ coupling is possible .",
    "in particular , substantial ( nearly 800-fold ) transmission enhancements of te fields were observed in @xcite by placing a metallic cut - wire array ( with the wires centered on the slits and parallel to them ) on a thin dielectric substrate at the side of the screen that is directly illuminated .",
    "such phenomenon was shown to be attributable to the excitation of an electric ( dipole - like ) resonance in the cut wires , whose strong field localization near the input aperture of the slit allows effective coupling of the illuminating plane - wave with the evanescent spectrum , and thus its `` squeezing '' through the slits @xcite . building up on these results , in this letter , we show that richer effects ( and moderately higher transmission enhancements ) can be attained by pairing a second cut - wire array at the other side of the screen .",
    "cut - wire pairs have recently elicited attention as building blocks for ( magnetic or negative - index ) metamaterials ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) . for the scenario of interest , we show that such structures can induce te enhanced transmission phenomena via a richer phenomenology , whose underlying mechanisms can be tuned , by acting on the structure parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) , thereby providing new degrees of freedom for engineering the enhanced transmission phenomena .",
    "the geometry of interest , obtained via two - dimensional ( 2-d ) replication of the unit cell ( of periods @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , is constituted by a metallic screen with infinitely long ( in the @xmath2 direction ) slits of subwavelength width @xmath3 [ fig . [ figure1](b ) ] separated by a distance @xmath1 [ fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) ] . generalizing the scenario in @xcite , in our configuration , the screen ( of thickness @xmath4 )",
    "is embedded in a dielectric slab of relative permittivity @xmath5 and thickness @xmath6 [ fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) ] , with a 1-d array of metallic wires ( of length @xmath7 , width @xmath8 , and thickness @xmath9 ) laid at each side of the slab along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the arrays are located at the center of each slit , with period @xmath0 ( i.e. , longitudinal gap @xmath10 ) , and a possible longitudinal displacement @xmath11 [ fig . [ figure1](c ) ] .",
    "we study the time - harmonic response , under te - polarized ( @xmath12directed electric field ) plane - wave excitation , via the finite - integration commercial software package cst microwave studio @xcite . in our simulations",
    "below , we assume an aluminum ( electrical conductivity @xmath13 s / m ) screen , copper ( @xmath14 s / m ) wires , and a lossless dielectric , unless otherwise stated . the 3-d unit cell in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] is terminated via periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath15 plane and with open - boundary ( matched ) conditions along @xmath16 ( with a 10 mm air layer at each side of the slab ) , and is discretized using an adaptive hexahedral mesh ( resulting , within the parametric range of interest , in about @xmath17 cells ) .     with @xmath1=30 mm , @xmath3=5.5 mm , @xmath4=0.5 mm , @xmath8=1.6 mm , @xmath9=0.2 mm , @xmath7=24 mm , @xmath18=6 mm ( i.e. , @xmath19=30 mm ) , @xmath11=0 , @xmath5=3 ( loss - tangent=0 ) , and @xmath6=1.5 mm . as a reference ,",
    "also shown ( black dashed curve , magnified by a factor 50 for visualization purposes ) is the response of the slitted screen alone .",
    "the two insets illustrate the longitudinal surface current ( real part ) distributions on the top ( blue dotted ) and bottom ( magenta dash - dotted ) wires , at the two resonances .",
    "( b ) , ( c ) electric field magnitude maps ( in the @xmath20 plane at the center of the wire gap , with the metallic - screen and dielectric slab regions overlaid as solid and dashed lines , respectively ) at the two resonances ( 3.916 and 4.230 ghz , respectively).,width=332 ]",
    "figure [ figure2](a ) illustrates a representative normal - incidence transmittance ( @xmath21 ) spectrum , for a configuration featuring a lossless dielectric and longitudinally symmetric [ i.e. , @xmath22 in fig . [ figure1](c ) ] cut - wire pairs , over a frequency range ( 210 ghz ) well below the cutoff frequency of the slit ( 15.75 ghz , taking into account the presence of the dielectric ) .",
    "two sharp resonances are clearly visible at frequencies of 3.916 ghz and 4.230 ghz , with transmittance peak values which turn out to be over three orders of magnitude ( 1230- and 1533-times , respectively ) stronger than the response attainable in the presence of the slitted screen only ( also shown as a reference ) . a deeper insight in the underlying mechanisms",
    "can be gained by looking at the surface current distributions on a cut - wire pair shown in the insets .",
    "in particular , the higher - frequency resonance is found to be associated with a _",
    "symmetric _ half - wavelength current mode , which previous studies on cut - wire - pair metamaterials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have identified as representative of _ electric - type _ resonance phenomena .",
    "conversely , the lower - frequency one is found to be associated to an _ anti - symmetric _ current mode , representative of _ magnetic - type _ resonance phenomena @xcite . figures [ figure2](b ) and [ figure2](c ) show the electric field intensity distributions in the @xmath23 plane ( at the center of the wire gap ) , from which it is fairly evident the strong localization effect that allows the field `` squeezing '' through the slit , as also observed in @xcite . consistently with previous observations in the literature @xcite , the two field distributions are rather different , with the localization most pronounced in the slit region for the electric resonance [ fig .",
    "[ figure2](c ) ] , and around the wire ends for the magnetic resonance [ fig . [ figure2](b ) ] .",
    "we note that the presence of two transmission resonances was also observed in @xcite for a configuration based only on a slit array embedded in a dielectric slab ( i.e. , without cut wires ) , and was attributed to the symmetric and anti - symmetric coupling of the surface waves supported by the slab .    , but varying the incidence angle ( a , b ) , the dielectric loss - tangent ( c , d ) , and the ( wire and screen ) metal conductivity ( e , f).,width=302 ]    besides the moderately higher transmission enhancement , by comparison with @xcite , the proposed scenario features a _ richer _ phenomenology , which involves both electric- and magnetic - type resonances , typical of cut - wire - pair structures , thereby endowing further degrees of freedom in the engineering of enhanced transmission .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore the robustness of these resonances and the possibilities of _ tuning _ them by acting on the structure parameters .",
    "in this framework , figs . [ figure3][figure8 ] compactly summarize the salient results from a comprehensive parametric study . specifically , fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] shows the resonant frequencies and transmittances observed for _ oblique _ incidence ( maintaining the te polarization ) , as well as in the presence of losses ( up to loss - tangent=0.01 ) in the dielectric substrate , and for various values of the electrical conductivity of the screen and wires .",
    "interestingly , the resonances turn out to be rather robust up to near - grazing incidence angles and moderate values of the dielectric losses , and maintain the clear - cut electric ( empty markers ) or magnetic ( full markers ) hallmarks illustrated above .",
    "a breakdown was observed for stronger loss levels ( loss - tangent=0.1 , not displayed ) , with the merging of the two resonances into a rather wide and low - transmittance peak .",
    "on the other hand , the metal conductivity appears to yield stronger effects in the peak transmittance , going from a practically _ unit _ value ( for both electric and magnetic resonances ) in the ideal perfectly electric conducting ( pec ) case , to values over twice smaller for the magnetic resonance in the presence of _ finite _ but relatively high conductivity values ( @xmath24 s / m ) .",

    "[ figure2 ] . within the parametric ranges",
    "considered , the response is still characterized by two clear - cut electric- and magnetic - type resonances , with the frequency and transmittance values pertaining to the magnetic resonances always lower than their electric counterparts .",
    "moreover , it can be observed that both resonant frequencies are mostly sensitive to the wire length [ fig . [ figure4](a ) ] , and very weakly dependent on the other parameters [ figs .",
    "[ figure4](c ) , [ figure4](e ) , and [ figure4](g ) ] . in connection with the transmittance values [ figs .",
    "[ figure4](b ) , [ figure4](d ) , [ figure4](f ) , and [ figure4](h ) ] , little variations are observed for the electric resonance , while a moderate sensitivity ( especially to the wire width and thickness ) is observed for the magnetic one .",
    "qualitatively similar considerations can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , which illustrates the effects of varying some other structural parameters ( dielectric relative permittivity @xmath5 , slit width @xmath3 , screen thickness @xmath4 , and @xmath25period @xmath1 ) . in this case , the only parameter that turns out to yield sensible variations in the resonant frequencies is the dielectric relative permittivity [ fig . [ figure5](a ) ] , while all parameters seem to affect ( in mild to moderate forms ) the transmittance values [ figs .",
    "[ figure5](b ) , [ figure5](d ) , [ figure5](f ) , and [ figure5](h ) ] .",
    "more complex are the effects induced by varying the wire longitudinal displacement @xmath11 and the dielectric slab thickness @xmath6 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] . in these cases ,",
    "the clear - cut electric or magnetic hallmarks are not always preserved , and some _ hybrid _ forms ( indicated as half - empty markers ) show up in certain parametric ranges . in particular , by increasing the dielectric slab thickness ( and , hence ,",
    "the electrical spacing between the arrays ) , the two resonances tend to _ merge _ into a hybrid form in which only the top wire is significantly excited , with progressively lower transmittance values [ figs . [",
    "figure6](c ) and [ figure6](d ) ] .",
    "in such regime , the behavior is not very different from the _ single _ wire structure in @xcite , and the progressively lower transmittance values can be easily explained taking into account that increasing the slab thickness results in a weaker evanescent coupling .",
    "conversely , by varying the wire longitudinal displacement @xcite , an interesting _ crossing _ phenomenon is observed [ figs .",
    "[ figure6](a ) and [ figure6](b ) ] , i.e. , a _ merging _ followed by an inversion in the frequency locations of the electric and magnetic resonances , with a transition region characterized by hybrid resonances ( some of which with relatively low transmittances ) .",
    "such behavior is generally much more complex than the one illustrated above , and also includes situations where the current amplitudes on the wire pair are moderately different ( for which a prevailing electric or magnetic behavior could still be attributed ) .",
    "as a representative example , fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] shows the transmittance spectrum and resonant features pertaining to a longitudinal displacement @xmath26 mm . in the transmittance response ,",
    "one can still observe two peaks with significantly different amplitudes . from the current distributions on the wires ( shown in the insets ) and the field maps [ figs .",
    "[ figure7](b ) and [ figure7](c ) ] , it can be observed that the lower - amplitude resonance is associated with a weak ( and anti - symmetric ) excitation of both wires , which results in a rather inefficient coupling , whereas the much more efficient coupling of the other resonance is mainly attributable to the strong excitation of the top wire .    ,",

    "[ figure8 ] .",
    "as it can be observed , such _ doubly - tuned _ design exhibits a relative bandwidth ( @xmath31% ) over four times larger than typical values attainable via a _ singly - tuned _ design based on the same structure featuring only the top cut - wire array ( i.e. , only one resonance , as in @xcite ) , whose typical response is also shown as a reference .",

    ". transverse wire displacement may also be used as a design parameter , but typically results in a less effective coupling @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated the potentials of paired cut - wire arrays in enhancing the transmission of te fields through subwavelength slits in a thin metallic screen .",
    "we have shown that such enhanced transmission phenomena originate from the excitation of electric- and magnetic - type resonances supported by the cut - wire pairs .",
    "the associated resonance frequencies can be tuned by acting on the structure parameters ( mainly , the wire length and longitudinal displacement , and the dielectric substrate electrical thickness ) , and their distance can be adjusted over a moderately wide bandwidth ( nearly 10% in the examples above ) . besides the inherent basic interest in the additional mechanisms attainable ,",
    "we have shown the possibility of ( jointly or separately ) tuning the electric- and magnetic - type resonances , with possible application to pass - band - type designs , which may open up new perspectives in the engineering of enhanced transmission phenomena .",
