    "within the standard model ( sm ) , the flavour non - diagonal couplings in the weak charged - current interactions are described by the unitary cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix@xcite .",
    "the sm has been considered as the complete description of the weak interactions .",
    "however , it is widely believed that there must be physics beyond the sm .",
    "the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) is one of the simplest extensions in new physics .",
    "currently , @xmath4 factories at slac and kek have started to measure the @xmath0 violating asymmetries in the decays of @xmath4 mesons and provide a test of the sm explanation of @xmath0 violation .",
    "the goal of this paper is to examine the possible effects of a right handed boson @xmath11 on the determinations of @xmath0 violating decay asymmetries .",
    "the @xmath12 structure of the weak charged currents was established after the discovery of parity violation@xcite .",
    "this is manifested in the standard model by having only the left - handed fermions transform under the @xmath13 group .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether or not the right - handed fermions take part in charged - current weak interactions , and if they do , with what strength .",
    "charged - current interactions for the right - handed fermions can easily be introduced by extending the gauge group@xcite .",
    "the simplest example is the @xmath14 model , where the left - handed fermions transform as doublets under @xmath15 and as singlet under @xmath16 , with the situation reversed for the right - handed fermions@xcite .",
    "the addition of a new @xmath17 to the gauge group implies the existence of three new weakly interacting gauge bosons : two are charged and one is neutral .    the charged right - handed gauge bosons ( denoted by @xmath18 ) and a neutral gauge boson @xmath19 acquire masses , which are proportional to a vacuum expectation value , and which become much heavier than those of the usual left - handed @xmath20 and @xmath21 bosons .",
    "the charged current weak interactions can be written as ( suppressing the generation mixing ) @xmath22 where the gauge coupling for left and right handed currents is assumed to have the same strength @xmath23 , and a @xmath24 mixing term is neglected since it is highly suppressed by the experimental data@xcite .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath25 , the charged current weak interactions will appear almost maximally parity - violating at low energies .",
    "any deviation from the pure left - handed ( or @xmath12 ) structure of the charged weak current will constitute evidence for a right - handed current and therefore a left - right symmetric structure of weak interactions .    within the @xmath26 model",
    ", we denote the left- and right- handed quark mixing matrices by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the form of @xmath27 is parametrized by@xcite @xmath29 on the other hand , the choice of the manifest left - right symmetry , i.e. , @xmath30 , would yield a very strigent bound @xmath31 tev from the constraint of the kaon mass difference@xcite .",
    "the limits from @xmath32 for arbitary @xmath33 were first considered by olness and ebel@xcite and followed by langacker and sankar@xcite .",
    "they showed that the lower limit of the @xmath3 mass could be reduced by taking either of the following two general forms of @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , along with the unitarity condition @xmath37 .",
    "the former type will be called the case of st - coupling ( @xmath38 ) and the latter that of dt - coupling ( @xmath39 ) in the paper .",
    "there is the possibility of having an overall phase factor @xmath40 multiplying both matrices , but in all relevant processes considered here , the @xmath3 is not mixed but reabsorbed , so these phase factors are always cancelled by their complex conjugates and are not independent variables for statistical purposes .",
    "we therefore take @xmath41 to be zero for simplicity .",
    "a general parametrization of @xmath42 will involve six phases@xcite .",
    "there is not enough data to constrain this many variables . as shown below",
    ", the contributions to @xmath43 from @xmath33 from @xmath44 and/or @xmath45 quarks in the inner box could be a thousand times the standard model , unless products of @xmath33 matrix elements were one part per thousand .",
    "since the error on @xmath46 is only 10% to 15% from @xmath47 , these matrix elements would have to be small and finely tuned to contribute .",
    "so it is more natural to assume that they are essentially zero for our calculations .",
    "this means that the @xmath45 and @xmath44 elements of the @xmath48 or @xmath49 columns are taken to vanish , as in the cases of st- and dt - coupling , respectively , in equation ( 3 ) .    for our purposes of showing the effects of lrsm in @xmath4 physics @xmath0 violating experiments",
    ", we use the above cases as starting points .",
    "they will each be shown to bring in only one independent right hand phase .",
    "the cp violation parameter @xmath1 in @xmath2 decays , which is proportional to the imaginary part of the box diagrams mediated by two @xmath50 , or two @xmath11 or a @xmath24 pair , is given as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the hamiltonian from the box diagrams named above .",
    "the @xmath53 contribution gives@xcite @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and the inami - lim functions [ 7 ] are @xmath56          -{3 \\over 2 } ( { x \\over 1-x } ) ^{3 } \\ln{x},\\ ] ] @xmath57,\\ ] ] with @xmath58 the factors @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are qcd corrections@xcite .    the two @xmath3 exchange part , @xmath61 , gives no contribution due to the factor @xmath62 vanishing for both cases of @xmath28 as shown in eq .",
    "@xmath63 .",

    "their values are @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for @xmath76 tev and @xmath77 gev at the scale @xmath78 gev .",
    "the contribution to @xmath1 from @xmath65 only comes from the following combinations of quark mixing elements surviving in @xmath79 : for the case of st - coupling @xmath80 ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for the case of dt - coupling @xmath81 again , the contributions to @xmath43 would be of the same order as in the sm in the case of st - coupling , or 10 to 100 times as large in that of dt - coupling , unless some of the parameters were very small or if a cancelation occured .",
    "so we will adjust the parameters in @xmath28 so that no contribution to @xmath1 will come from @xmath65 .",
    "this is accomplished by various conditions@xcite in the two cases .",
    "for the case of st - coupling ( @xmath39 ) , the lrsm model needs effectively : @xmath82 from the geometry of the unitarity triangle in the @xmath83 plane , we see that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the unitarity triangle angle at @xmath86 . in this case , using the unitarity relation also , we have remaining two @xmath38 variables to vary : @xmath49 and @xmath87 . for the case of dt - coupling",
    "the lrsm model effectively needs @xmath88 in this case we have only the variable @xmath87 in @xmath39 to vary .",
    "there are other solutions to suppress @xmath1 .",
    "however , we use the above cases since they give the most significant effects on @xmath0 violation in @xmath4 decay by @xmath11 . in summary",
    "then , the right handed mixing matrices have become : @xmath89 just as in the left handed ckm matrix where there is one somewhat sizeable parameter ( @xmath90 ) mixing the lightest generations , while the other matrix elements are rather small , a similar behavior is seen in the right hand matrix . in the case of st - coupling ( @xmath38 ) , it is the heavier generations that mix more than the lightest one , and in the case of dt - coupling ( @xmath39 ) it is the light s and d quarks whose mixing elements switch roles .",
    "once the disappearance of the lr contribution to @xmath43 is arranged , which comes from the imaginary part of the @xmath91 matrix element , we also find that the contribution of the real part , which gives @xmath32 , is also very small : there is no contribution in the case of dt - coupling , and in the case of st - coupling , the contributions are only from @xmath92 and @xmath93 intermediate quarks .",
    "these contributions have the same orders of @xmath90 as in the sm , but are suppressed by @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "recently , some detailed analyses of @xmath11 effects on @xmath1 have been made@xcite in the lrsm models in which the third generation was not dominant .",
    "the large @xmath96 expansion and chiral perturbation theory were applied to estimate the left - right hadronic matrix elements @xmath97 and their uncertainties .",
    "the models considered here have dominant third generation effects and are complementary to the other models .",
    "what we find here is that even with the mixing matrices @xmath42 in both cases that avoid the @xmath43 and @xmath32 constraints , the other experiments still give a lower bound of @xmath98 tev in the case of dt - coupling , at 95% cl . in this case , even though @xmath99 in @xmath3 production , the experimental d0 limit from fermilab@xcite is @xmath100 gev at 95% cl ( see fig . 3 of ref . 13 .",
