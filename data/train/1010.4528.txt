    "the dramatic progress in laser technology has enabled a novel area of studies exploring laser - matter interactions at ultra - high intensity @xcite .",
    "the intensity level of @xmath0 has recently been achieved @xcite and two projects @xcite aiming at intensity levels up to @xmath1 have been supported and are under way .",
    "furthermore , several original proposals have been suggested e.g. @xcite , which reach even higher intensities with almost the present level of technology .",
    "one of the key phenomena of laser - matter interactions , that probably dominates at ultra - high intensities of our interest , is the occurrence of qed cascades @xcite .",
    "these cascades ( also called avalanches , or showers ) are caused by successive events of hard photon emissions and electron - positron pair photoproduction by hard photons .",
    "as predicted in @xcite based on qualitative estimations , the cascades may arise as soon as the laser field strength exceeds the threshold value of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fine structure constant and @xmath4 is the characteristic qed field .",
    "such a field strength corresponds to an intensity of @xmath5 .",
    "previously qed cascades have been observed and studied as a part of extensive air showers ( eas ) in the context of the passage of ultra - high energy particles , that originate from cosmic rays , through the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "however , similar processes can be observed in the external electromagnetic field as well . in this case , bremsstrahlung is replaced by the non - linear compton scattering and bethe - heitler process is replaced by the non - linear breit - wheeler process .",
    "the latter processes are well studied both theoretically @xcite and in laser experiments @xcite and are probably of great importance for astrophysics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an important novel distinctive feature of the cascades in the ultra - strong laser field , compared to situations ever studied previously , is that the laser field is not only able to be a target for ultra - relativistic electrons and hard photons , but can also accelerate the charged particles to ultra - relativistic energies .    as a result",
    ", the cascades can be produced even by initially slow electrons or positrons , if they were somehow injected into the strong field region .",
    "moreover , the mean energy of the particles is no longer decreasing in the course of the cascade development due to its redistribution among the permanently growing number of the created particles , but rather is restoring at the expense of the energy extracted from the laser field .",
    "this must lead to a vast increase of the cascade yield , as compared to the cascades in media or in strong magnetic fields .",
    "in this case the cascade multiplicity would be restricted either by the duration of stay of the particles in the focal region of the laser field , or even , under more extreme conditions , by the total energy stored in the laser field . in the latter case",
    "the focused laser pulses would be depleted by cascade production .    as it will be explained in more details below",
    ", the restoration mechanism works if the particles can be accelerated transversely to the field .",
    "it was conjectured @xcite on the basis of qualitative analysis for the model of a uniformly rotating electric fields , that this may be indeed the case .    in the eas theory , the 1d approximation is often used because spreading in transverse direction is inessential for ultrarelativistic particles and has no significance for that problem .",
    "besides , the cascade equations can be solved in this case analytically within the ultra - relativistic approximation by means of the mellin transform @xcite .",
    "the results of such analytic theory are in good agreement with both experiments @xcite and direct monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the attempts to treat the cascades in strong magnetic fields on similar grounds are also known @xcite . however , though the @xmath6 approximation remains valid , the cascade equations can not be simplified via the mellin transform unless some further approximation is made . according to monte - carlo simulations @xcite , the resulting analytical approach works much worse here than in the case of 1d approximation for eas . in our case of cascades arising in a laser field , the structure of the cascade equations ( see appendix [ sec : cascade_eqs ] )",
    "is the same as for the magnetic field , but it is impossible to incorporate restoration mechanism within the 1d approximation in momentum space .",
    "this means that our problem is essentially two- or three dimensional .    in this work we report on the first results of the monte - carlo simulations of cascades produced by initially slow electrons in a uniformly rotating homogeneous electric field .",
    "such a field can be obtained practically at the antinodes of a standing electromagnetic wave . the choice of the field model is uniquely specified by the existence of reasonable qualitative estimations for scaling of the basic cascade characteristics for this particular case @xcite .",
    "our goal was to prove explicitly the existence of the restoration mechanism and to test the estimations @xcite by direct numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , which can be considered as a technical introduction , we review and collect the known information on the elementary quantum processes : single photon emission by electrons and pair creation by hard photons in strong fields of arbitrary configuration . though this information is not completely new , it is of essential importance for our presentation and is spread among the literature on the subject .",
    "after that , in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we present the reasoning in favor of the energy restoration mechanism for cascades in electromagnetic fields . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we formulate the assumptions of our model , present the details of our monte - carlo routine and discuss the results obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "these results are compared to the known estimations .",
    "summary and discussion is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] . finally , in appendix",
    "[ sec : cascade_eqs ] , we discuss the cascade equations for our problem and explicitly demonstrate that , contrary to the recent doubts @xcite , the approach we use takes proper account of radiation friction by ultrarelativistic electrons .",
    "general properties of radiation of ultrarelativistic particles are well known @xcite . due to the relativistic aberration effect the momenta of the products of any decay of an ultrarelativistic particle",
    "are directed within the narrow angle @xmath7 with its momentum , where @xmath8 .",
    "thus , radiation of a charged ultrarelativistic particle is visible at a point of observation only for a short period of time @xmath9 during which its momentum turns through the angle of the order @xmath10 .",
    "the momentum turning angle can be estimated by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the characteristic value of the transverse component of the field .",
    "thus , @xmath13 .",
    "the characteristic frequency @xmath14 of classical radiation can be most simply estimated in the proper reference frame of the particle , by transition to which the duration @xmath9 transforms into @xmath15 .",
    "thus , @xmath16 . in the laboratory frame ,",
    "due to the doppler up - shift , we would thus have @xmath17 .",
    "such a scaling with @xmath18 is typical for congeneric problems and arises e.g. in the theory of synchrotron radiation .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 @xcite , being the ratio of the classically estimated mean energy of an emitted photon to the energy of the radiating particle , determines whether the process of radiation is controlled by classical electrodynamics or qed .",
    "namely , if @xmath20 , then quantum recoil is inessential and radiation is classical , whereas if @xmath21 then it must be quantum .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is lorentz and gauge invariant and is precisely defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the strength tensor of the field and @xmath25 is the @xmath26-momentum of a particle . in what follows , we assume that @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "we assume that the field is of relativistic strength in the sense that the dimensionless field amplitude @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the 4-vector of the field potential .",
    "the latter means , in particular , that it varies on the scale that exceeds @xmath9 and thus can be considered constant with respect to the decay processes .",
    "two different theoretical approaches have been developed in order to study photon emission by ultrarelativistic ( @xmath30 ) charged particles in electromagnetic fields of ultrarelativistic ( @xmath31 , @xmath21 ) but still subcritical ( @xmath27 ) intensities .",
    "nikishov and ritus ( nr ) have calculated the appropriate quantum amplitudes in terms of volkov solutions in a constant _ crossed _ field ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) of arbitrary strength @xcite .",
    "their results can be applied directly to our problem because , as they have pointed out especially , under the abovementioned conditions _ any _ field looks locally as constant and crossed , the latter in the sense that both field invariants @xmath34 and @xmath35 are much less than @xmath36 .",
    "the other approach by baier and katkov ( bk ) @xcite is based on the observation that the motion of a particle in between two acts of photon emission ( which corresponds to free lines of feynman diagrams ) can be considered classically if @xmath27 , so that all the relevant quantum corrections are reduced to quantum recoil and , possibly , to field - spin interactions . in a sense ,",
    "the bk approach is equivalent to the replacement of the aforementioned volkov solutions by the localized wave packets moving along the classically prescribed trajectories .",
    "both approaches are based essentially on the same approximations and provide the same results for the energy spectra of emitted photons .",
    "the energy distribution of the probability rate for photon emission by ultrarelativistic electrons in an electromagnetic field is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the airy function , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the energies of the emitted photon and the initial electron , respectively .",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 are the dimensionless quantum parameters for the electron before and after emission , and for the emitted photon , respectively . in terms of the field strengths ,",
    "this parameter is represented as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the energy and the momentum of the corresponding particle .",
    "note that expression ( [ phot_emiss ] ) suffers from the infrared singularity at @xmath49 .",
    "however , in our constant field approximation this singularity @xmath50 is weaker than the usual @xmath51 scaling of the infrared behavior of perturbative qed @xcite .",
    "in particular , the total radiation probability rate is infrared convergent in our approximation . the infrared sector , however , is not important for the parameters considered in our paper , because most of the emitted radiation are found to have much larger frequencies than the frequency of the driving field .",
    "the energy distribution of the probability rate for direct pair creation by hard photons ( @xmath52 ) is given by @xcite @xmath53 where the indices `` @xmath18 '' and `` @xmath54 '' this time refer to the initial photon and to the created electron , respectively . for the created positron ,",
    "we have @xmath55 @xmath45 . formula ( [ pair_cr ] ) is completely symmetric with respect to electron and positron remaining unchanged under the replacement @xmath56 .",
    "similarity between formulas ( [ phot_emiss ] ) and ( [ pair_cr ] ) is explained by the fact that these two processes are related by the cross - symmetry @xcite .     the sign of @xmath57 along the particle trajectory at @xmath58 in different zones of the @xmath59 plane .",
    "the shaded zones correspond to acceleration ( increase of @xmath42 ) of positrons and deceleration ( decrease of @xmath42 ) of electrons .",
    "the non - shaded zones correspond to the vice - versa situation.,width=245 ]    the total probability rates for both processes @xmath60 can not be written in terms of known special functions and should be obtained by numerical integrations .",
    "however , they allow simple asymptotic expressions in the limits of small and large @xmath42 , @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "namely , we have    [ wrad ] @xmath61 @xmath62    and    [ wcr ] @xmath63 @xmath64    eqs .",
    "( [ wrad_small_chi ] ) , ( [ wcr_small_chi ] ) in these formulas describe the quasiclassical regime . for small values of the quantum parameter @xmath44 ,",
    "the probability rate for pair photoproduction @xmath65 is suppressed exponentially , in accordance with the essentially quantum nature of this process . at the same time",
    ", @xmath66 remains @xmath67 , thus providing a finite classical limit for the mean radiated intensity @xmath68 .",
    "as for the limit of large @xmath22 , both rates ( [ wrad_large_chi ] ) and ( [ wcr_large_chi ] ) differ only by a numerical factor of the order of unity",
    ".    given the energy and the momentum of the electron before emission , eq .",
    "( [ phot_emiss ] ) determines the probability distribution for the energy @xmath40 of the emitted photon . under our assumption @xmath69 , the momentum of this photon",
    "is given by @xmath70 .",
    "the energy and the momentum of the electron after emission should be determined from the conservation laws . in the electromagnetic background",
    ", they are of the form @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the four - momentum extracted from the field . the exact value of this @xmath72 essentially depends on the global structure of the field .",
    "this is because the whole spacetime contributes to the integrals in the qed matrix element that yield delta - functions expressing the conservation laws .",
    "for example , in a crossed constant field with the poynting vector directed along the @xmath73-axis the conserved quantities are @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in a constant electric field ,",
    "the canonical momentum is conserved . in a constant magnetic field ,",
    "directed along the @xmath73 axis and with symmetric gauge , the conserved quantities are the number of the landau level , the angular momentum , and @xmath77 .",
    "nevertheless , for ultrarelativistic particles there is actually no difference between these possibilities , and either of them can be adopted with the accuracy of our approximation .",
    "the reason is that @xmath78 .",
    "in particular , we can assume @xmath79 .",
    "the same argument can be applied to pair creation by hard photons as well .",
    "in addition to one - photon emission and direct pair photoproduction reviewed above , there exist more complicated higher - order processes , such as e.g. the two - photon emission @xmath80 or the trident process @xmath81 .",
    "their specific feature is that the intermediate particle is off the mass shell , i.e. is virtual .",
    "however , in strong field situations of our interest the two - step processes dominate @xcite . for this reason",
    ", we do not consider higher - order processes in the sequel .",

    "the hard photons which have created pairs during the simulation time are shown as the dashed lines .",
    "the trajectory of the primary positron ignoring any qed processes is plotted as the thick light gray curve.,width=325 ]    since there is no difference whether an electron or a positron initiates a cascade , we assume in this section that our cascade is initiated by a positron ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "consider a positron in a homogeneous , uniformly rotating electric field @xmath85 the equation of motion @xmath86 with the initial condition @xmath87 , can be easily solved : @xmath88 here , @xmath89 is the dimensionless field amplitude .",
    "let us assume first that the positron is at rest ( @xmath90 ) initially ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "equations  ( [ e(t ) ] ) and  ( [ newton_sol ] ) show that the energy and the quantum parameter @xmath22 of the positron for this case depend on time as    @xmath92    @xmath93    both quantities are increasing initially .",
    "they are oscillating with the period @xmath94 of the rotation of the field .",
    "the amplitudes of these oscillations , @xmath95 , @xmath96 are proportional to @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively , and are quite large under our basic assumptions .",
    "for example , @xmath99 approaches unity already at @xmath100 for an optical rotation frequency of @xmath83 .",
    "this corresponds to the field strength @xmath101 and the intensity @xmath102 .",
    "since @xmath103 under such conditions , the positron , according to the preceding section , is able to emit a hard photon with @xmath104 , which , in turn , can create an electron - positron pair .",
    "however , at such intensities a new generation of pairs is typically produced on the time scale @xmath105 , and the whole pair generation process may be rather sensitive to peculiarities of the field model . as we discuss below",
    ", stable cascade formation is expected at higher intensity levels .",
    "the formulas ( [ eps(t ) ] ) and ( [ chi(t ) ] ) become especially simple for stronger fields @xmath106 , because in this case the value @xmath107 is being reached within just a small fraction @xmath108 of the rotation period .",
    "namely , we have    @xmath109    @xmath110    eq .",
    "( [ eps(t)1 ] ) is easy to understand , because initially the positron is accelerating almost along the field . in order to understand eq .",
    "( [ chi(t)1 ] ) better , let us note that in the case @xmath111 , according to eqs .  ( [ e(t ) ] ) and ( [ newton_sol ] ) ,",
    "the momentum of the positron constitutes exactly the angle @xmath112 with both the instant direction of the field and the @xmath113-axis .",
    "intuitively , this is because due to its inertia the particle does not follow the rotation of the field precisely . as a consequence , the transverse component of the field with respect to momentum of the particle increases as @xmath114 . since @xmath115",

    "the parameter @xmath122 is related to the commonly accepted parameter @xmath97 by @xmath123 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the cascades can be caused by initially slow particles if @xmath124 .",

    "although propagation of the resulting hard photon is not affected by the field , nevertheless its @xmath44 continues to increase after emission just due to rotation of the field .    in order to understand better what must happen after the first hard photon emission , let us come back to eq .",
    "( [ newton_sol ] ) and consider the general initial condition .",
    "it is easy to see that in the case @xmath129 the sign of the derivative of the quantity ( [ chi ] ) is determined completely by the expression @xmath130 .",

    "@xmath42 can be expected to increase for some time .",
    "the time @xmath133 can be identified with the creation time of a new pair .",
    "since the momentum of a primary positron is confined to the shaded region to the right , and the new secondary particles are created with momenta parallel to the momentum of parental particle in our approximation , we see that momenta of the secondary particles also lie in the shaded sector .",
    "thus , the newly created positrons are accelerating with @xmath134 , while the newly created electrons are initially decelerating ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "however , they are quickly turned back by the field and also get accelerated . the same will be true for successive pair creation processes as well .    in spite of the complexity of the picture of the cascade development ( see fig .  [ cascade_devel ] )",
    ", some general estimations for it can nevertheless be obtained @xcite in the high - field limit @xmath136 .",
    "the idea is that , due to similarity of the rates ( [ wrad_large_chi ] ) and ( [ wcr_large_chi ] ) , and also because the variation of the angles between the momenta of all particles ( positrons , electrons , and photons ) and the field is determined by the same temporal scale @xmath137 , there is actually no need to distinguish between all three sorts of particles .",
    "so , an order of magnitude estimation can be provided within the model of a simple doubling chain process .",
    "let us denote by @xmath138 the typical lifetime for electrons and positrons with respect to hard photon emission .",

    "for example , the growth rates extracted from the curves 1 - 3 at fig .  [ chi_n(t ) ] are @xmath183 and @xmath184 , respectively .",
    "we have studied the averages of the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath41 and @xmath185 over the cascade .",
    "for example , temporal evolution of the mean value @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the instant number of present electrons and @xmath188 is the instant value of the quantum dynamical parameter for the @xmath189-th electron , as depicted in the left plot of fig .",

    "one can see that at later times the random fluctuations are smoothed out and the quantity ( [ av_chi ] ) stabilizes acquiring some definite constant value which is independent of the simulation run .",

    ", the mean energies of electrons and positrons coincide as is expected from symmetry consideration , whereas the mean photon energy typically remains smaller . at the same time , the energy spectrum of created electrons and positrons is wider than the photon spectrum ( see fig .  [ spectr ] ) .",
    "both features are explained naturally by the fact that in our setup the hard photons ( @xmath145 ) are quickly converted into pairs which survive , whereas soft photons ( @xmath192 ) are stable with respect to pair photoproduction and hence are accumulated .",
    "in the high energy region , all the spectra are likely to show exponential decay .",
    "the energy spectra for different components of the cascade at @xmath193 for @xmath194 and @xmath195.,width=302 ]    one of our main tasks was the investigation of the validity of estimations ( [ estimations ] ) and ( [ n(t ) ] ) which were suggested previously in ref .",
    "@xcite and are of crucial importance . in particular , eq .  ( [ n(t ) ] ) was serving as an argument for the estimation of the maximal value of the intensity attainable with focused laser fields . in order to test these estimations",
    "we have performed parametric studies of the stabilized values of the quantities @xmath196 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 and of the increment @xmath182 .",
    "these results are presented in fig .",
    "[ param ] .",
    "the left plot demonstrates the dependence of the ratios of the quantities obtained by simulations to their estimations ( [ estimations ] ) on @xmath122 for fixed rotation frequency @xmath83 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that for large values of @xmath122 each ratio acquires some definite limit of the order of unity . according to our results",
    "the formulas ( [ estimations ] ) are valid up to some numerical coefficients of the order of unity , which vary no more than twice in the whole range @xmath197 .",

    "( [ n(t ) ] ) for two different rotation frequencies",

    "one can see that for large values of @xmath122 the estimation ( [ n(t ) ] ) is justified with good accuracy even without any correction factor . for @xmath199 formula ( [ n(t ) ] ) overestimates @xmath182 but not more than by half of an order of magnitude .",
    "this may be nevertheless crucial for the estimation of the total cascade yield due to its exponential dependence on @xmath182 .",
    "for the particular value @xmath200 , which was exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite , formula ( [ n(t ) ] ) overestimates @xmath182 by approximately a factor of @xmath201 .",
    "this , however , can be compensated in principle by simultaneous underestimation of the escape time in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in order to apply the results of our simulations to estimate the cascade yield by a realistic focused laser field , we assume that the appearing electrons and positrons are pushed away as a whole from the focus by the ponderomotive potential in radial direction with almost the speed of light . assuming the gaussian profile of the focused beam we can write @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the value of the parameter @xmath122 at the center of the focus and @xmath204 is the focal radius . then the total number of pairs produced by the cascade can be estimated to the @xmath205 the remaining integral defines the effective time of escape from the focus and equals @xmath206 , i.e. is @xmath207 times larger than it was assumed in ref .",
    "this correction almost totally cancels the overestimation of @xmath182 by formula ( [ n(t ) ] ) at @xmath200 that we have observed in our simulations .",
    "thus , we hope that the quantitative predictions in ref .  @xcite must remain unaffected by our corrections .",
    "one can see that we are currently neglecting the complicating details in our code such as , e.g. the elastic collisions , the compton scattering , and the annihilation processes . such phenomena must become important only at later times , when the plasma is dense enough . though successive collisions and annihilations of the electron and positron from the same created pair may be important @xcite , we are currently ignoring these effects for simplicity .",
    "of hard photons emission which destroys the spatial coherence of field - driven oscillations of electron and positron .",
    "] we ignore the higher - order processes , such as two - photon creation and the trident processes as well ( see the remark at the end of sec .  [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "all these assumptions are natural and commonly accepted in the present cascade theory @xcite , even though they may be revised in future studies .",
    "due to limitations of computer power , we currently stop our simulations after the creation of around @xmath208 pairs .",
    "this was shown to be enough to estimate the growth rate @xmath182 , as well as to average the characteristics of a cascade over the ensemble of pairs with reasonable accuracy . in the time interval of simulation these pairs occupy a volume of the order @xmath209 , where @xmath210 .",
    "this corresponds to the pair density @xmath211 .",
    "typical values of the @xmath18-factor for electrons and positrons are @xmath212 , see fig .",
    "[ spectr ] .",
    "this corresponds to their energies @xmath213 .",
    "assuming the temperature @xmath214 , we can estimate the debye screening radius @xmath215 .",
    "the relativistic plasma frequency @xmath216 remains about five orders of magnitude smaller than the optical frequency .",
    "for these reasons we have completely neglected coulomb interaction between electrons and positrons and all the accompanying collective plasma effects in the present simulations . however , the density of pairs is growing exponentially , @xmath217 , and hence @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "after a relatively short period of time @xmath220 , when the number of pairs becomes macroscopic ( @xmath221 ) , the quantities @xmath222 and @xmath223 attain the values @xmath224 and @xmath225 , respectively , and the collective plasma effects may come into play . within our approximation of a homogeneous field ,",
    "the total number of created pairs would be restricted by the screening of the external field by the self - field of arising plasma .",
    "let us note , that despite some doubts in the literature @xcite , the radiation friction is taken into account properly in our version of the algorithm by the recoils happening at the times of photon emission ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and the appendix [ sec : cascade_eqs ] in our paper ) .",
    "hence , there is no need to include an additional radiation friction force in the equations of motion ( [ newton ] ) for electrons and positrons , otherwise this would cause double counting .",
    "moreover , our approach transfers the concept of classical radiation friction into the quantum domain in a correct fashion .",
    "it can be asked how the classical continuously acting radiation friction can be recovered from the sudden jumps of momentum similar to those in fig .",
    "[ chi_n(t ) ] .",
    "in fact this happens on the average with respect to the ensemble of monte - carlo realizations , since the moments of successive photon emissions are distributed randomly . at later times ,",
    "when the number of created pairs becomes large , the cascade forms a representative ensemble itself and there is in principle no need for taking the average over independent realizations .",
    "in this paper we have presented the first results of numerical simulations of the formation and development of electron - positron - photon cascades by initially slow electrons in a uniformly rotating homogeneous electric field .",
    "in such a situation the cascades reveal a principally new feature , i.e. the restoration of the energy and the dynamical quantum parameter due to the acceleration of electrons and positrons by the field .",
    "this feature may be of crucial importance for the whole physics of laser - matter interactions in the strong field domain , as it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "we have explicitly identified this restoration mechanism in the course of our simulations .",
    "also , our simulations clearly confirm the qualitative analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , including the basic scalings ( [ estimations ] ) and the estimation ( [ n(t ) ] ) for the cascade yield .",
    "so , they can be used to fix the remaining numerical correction factors in eqs .",
    "( [ estimations ] ) and ( [ n(t ) ] ) , which turn out to be of the order of unity .",
    "the numerical approach that we adopt is based on monte - carlo simulations of the cascade equations .",
    "we have shown explicitly that contrary to some recent doubts in literature @xcite such an approach incorporates radiation friction acting on individual electrons and positrons and , moreover , is doing this in a manner which is consistent with intense field qed .    the codes designed for our task can be readily adopted for simulating cascades in the laser fields with more realistic configurations , such as tightly focused gaussian beams and pulses .",
    "this is required in order to make more definite predictions on the impact of cascade production for possible future experiments , as well as for further corrections of the maximal value of intensity that can be attained with optical lasers @xcite .",
    "simulation of cascades in a focused laser field will be presented in a separate publication .",
    "however , let us make several brief comments about cascades in focused laser fields , possible experimental scenarios , and some yet unresolved technical problems that may require further studies .",
    "the restoration mechanism arises due to the curvature of the trajectories of the charged particles across the field and may be sensitive to its polarization .",
    "although we expect that this mechanism must work for generic field configurations ( e.g. , for generic tightly focused laser fields ) , there may exist several particular configurations for which the restoration mechanism does not work .",
    "for example , in an arbitrary constant electromagnetic field or a circularly polarized propagating plane electromagnetic wave the dynamical quantum parameter @xmath42 is conserved exactly in the course of motion . in the case of a generic propagating plane wave the amplitude of oscillations of the parameter @xmath42 for an initially slow electron does not exceed @xmath226 , i.e. , always remains smaller than unity .",
    "another example is a linearly polarized oscillating electric field @xcite , since in this case the initially slow particles are accelerated strictly along the field and hence the growth of the transverse component of the field is absent . in some intermediate cases ,",
    "e.g. for elliptical polarization or a weakly focused gaussian beam , restoration of @xmath42 must exist but may be less effective than in the case of circular polarization .",
    "however , in all the cases at least the usual cascades would be caused by external high - energy electrons or hard photons passing through the high - field region transverse to the field . in this case , the cascade yield remains microscopic and would be determined by both the initial energy of an external energetic particle and the laser field strength .    in order to initiate a cascade in a tightly focused laser field ,",
    "it is required to inject a primary particle into the center of a focal region .",
    "this task may be not trivial because the focal region is surrounded by a ponderomotive potential wall of the characteristic height @xmath227 .",
    "the external high - energy electrons will be most likely deflected rather than penetrate inside .",
    "the most direct and elegant scenario is based on the exploration of pairs that are created spontaneously from vacuum by the laser field itself @xcite , since they are appearing exactly at the center of the focus as required .",
    "however , this possibility implies high intensities @xmath228 .",
    "another possible resolution would be the initiation of cascades by energetic @xmath18-quanta . in our opinion",
    ", the final conclusion whether or not cascades _ with macroscopic yield _ can arise in _",
    "generic _ real experiments exploring laser - matter interaction at intensities lower than @xmath229 requires further studies .",
    "we note that for cascades that arise in the course of the interaction of high - intensity laser radiation with material targets it may be necessary to take the impact of ordinary cascades in matter into account as well @xcite .",
    "if the cascade yield attains macroscopic values ( @xmath230 ) , the self - field of the electron - positron plasma becomes comparable to the guiding field . in this regime screening of the external field and its absorption by the electron - positron plasma self - field",
    "will restrict further pair production .",
    "such a regime can be simulated by combining our codes with the particle - in - cell ( pic ) method @xcite .",
