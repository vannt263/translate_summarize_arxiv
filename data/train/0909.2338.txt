    "recently , a number of experiments have shown evidence of unusual properties above the superconducting transition temperature in under - doped cuprate superconductors .",

    "diamagnetic response above t@xmath4 has also been observed in under - doped bi - sr - ca - cu - o @xcite .",
    "these properties have been generally interpreted in terms of a superconducting state with non - zero superfluid density but dominated by strong phase fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "such a state should have interesting nonlinear response characterized by persistence of superconducting nonlinearities above t@xmath4 , as reported before with scalar nonlinearity measurements @xcite .",
    "the present study extends these results by measuring the complex harmonic voltage developed by under - doped cuprate superconductors when temperature is varied through the transition temperature .",
    "traditionally , the microwave nonlinear response of superconductors has been investigated by using resonator techniques where the superconducting sample is subject to high microwave magnetic fields , thus making the nonlinear effects measurable @xcite .",
    "the experimental data have been interpreted by using various time - dependent versions of the ginzbug - landau theory to estimate the order parameter relaxation time in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of high - t@xmath4 superconductors , the prospect of using these materials in microwave filters for the wireless industry has renewed interest in the microwave nonlinear response . in the more recent treatments ,",
    "the nonlinear effects are introduced as corrections to the complex conductivity and are evaluated by using a microscopic approach in the zero - frequency limit @xcite .",
    "the dc treatment is legitimate for the range of temperatures typical for the operation of high - t@xmath4 superconducting filters ( below t@xmath4 ) where the superconducting order parameter reacts almost instantaneously ( compared to the period of the microwave excitation ) to the applied field and the field screening is provided by the superfluid .",
    "the resulting field ( or current density)-dependent conductivity is used as an input parameter for calculations of circuit elements in lumped - element approximations of the superconducting transmission lines and resonators @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies addressing the operation of high - t@xmath4 superconducting resonators have shown that for temperatures significantly below t@xmath4 , the dominant nonlinear mechanism in these devices has an inductive origin due to the suppression of superfluid density by the current ( or applied magnetic field ) @xcite .",
    "resonator techniques have provided experimental support for the nonlinear meissner effect ( nlme ) at low temperatures in d - wave superconductors @xcite ( enhanced by the presence of nodes of the order parameter on the fermi surface as shown in the theoretical works of xu , yip and sauls @xcite and dahm and scalapino @xcite ) as well as close to t@xmath4 where the superfluid density is very sensitive to external perturbations @xcite . despite their success , the resonator techniques measure parts of the sample that are often less than ideal , such as patterned edges , or natural edges and corners of single crystals . such experiments do not provide information about the local properties of the samples and also usually do not provide phase information of the nonlinear response .",
    "this issue is relevant especially for high - t@xmath4 materials whose properties may vary on very short length scales due to their short coherence lengths .    to overcome this limitation , a nonresonant local near - field microwave technique has been created to make spatially - resolved studies of nonlinear response of superconductors @xcite .",
    "this experimental approach is highly sensitive to nonlinear effects close to t@xmath4 and provides a high spatial resolution dictated by the geometrical dimensions of the sensing element , as demonstrated in harmonic measurements above an artificially - created grain boundary @xcite .",

    "the harmonic data measured at t@xmath4 on yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) thin films has been interpreted in the framework of a ginzburg - landau - type model where the nonlinear source is the magnetic field(current)-dependent superfluid density n@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the current - suppressed superfluid density leads to an enhancement of the penetration depth @xmath16 , and consequently of the kinetic inductance , which in turn , leads to odd higher - order harmonics of inductive origin .",
    "the proposed model describes accurately the measured data ( temperature - dependent third - order harmonic scalar power p@xmath17(t ) ) in optimally - doped samples .",
    "this approach also largely avoids issues of nonlocality that are exacerbated by current build - up at patterned edges @xcite .",
    "however , in underdoped samples the current - dependent superfluid density n@xmath15 acting alone as an inductive nonlinear source can not explain the observed harmonic data .",
    "more specifically , the measured harmonic response p@xmath18 does not turn off at temperatures above the independently determined t@xmath4 as expected from the model , but exhibits a tail extending significantly above t@xmath4 in the pseudogap regime @xcite .",
    "it is this high - temperature behavior of p@xmath18 , including its origin and doping dependence , that prompted the present study .",
    "in addition , many theoretical predictions of interesting electrodynamic properties of the pseudogap exist in the literature @xcite , and should be investigated . by employing a novel experimental technique ,",
    "the harmonic response of cuprate thin films has been investigated at temperatures close to t@xmath4 , where not only the magnitude of the complex harmonic voltage / power is measured , as in previous work , but also its harmonic phase .",
    "this new experimental capability also motivates a new field - based , finite - frequency model to explain novel features observed mainly in the harmonic phase experimental data .",

    "the objective of the experiment ( shown in fig .  [ vna_fom_setup ] ) is to locally stimulate a homogeneous superconducting thin film with microwave currents and measure the resulting nonlinear response .",
    "the microwave excitation is provided by the internal source of a vector network analyzer , vna , ( agilent model number e8364b ) on port 1 at a fixed frequency @xmath21 ghz in the continuous - wave mode , low pass filtered ( to eliminate harmonics ) and coupled to the sample by means of a magnetic loop probe .",
    "the probe is built by using commercially - available coaxial cable ( ut034 ) where the inner conductor has been soldered to the outer one @xcite .",
    "this results in a semicircular loop with inner radius of roughly @xmath22 and an outer one of @xmath23 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ vna_fom_setup ] ) .",
    "the loop has been further mechanically polished at the outer radius in order to bring the microwave current , flowing in a thickness dictated by the skin depth at the inner radius of the loop , closer to the sample ( @xmath24 m ) , thus improving the loop - to - sample coupling and allowing the operation of the apparatus at lower input power levels .",
    "the signal originating from the sample comes back through the probe , is high - pass filtered to suppress the microwave power at the fundamental frequency @xmath12 and examined with the vna in the frequency - offset mode ( vna - fom ) by tuning the receiver on port 2 in a narrow frequency range ( 1 hz ) centered on the harmonic of interest ( @xmath14 in this case ) .",
    "the sample is placed in a cryogenic environment whose temperature is controlled between 78 and 100 k with an accuracy of 0.1 k and for each temperature a trace is acquired from the vna - fom and stored on a computer for further analysis .",

    "since during an experiment the reference path and most of the microwave circuit are at room temperature ( only about 10 cm of coaxial cable is inside the cryostat , however not in physical contact with the cold plate ) , it is legitimate to attribute the temperature dependence of the measured relative harmonic voltage @xmath35 entirely to the temperature - dependent nonlinear effects in the sample .",
    "since the microwave circuit is operated at low microwave power ( @xmath36 to @xmath37 dbm at vna port 1 ) , the background noise at @xmath14 is dominated by the intrinsic noise of the vna ( @xmath38 dbm when @xmath31 is measured without an input on vna port 2 ) .",

    "the maximum of the harmonic voltage magnitude occurs at a temperature lower than @xmath9 , thus in the superconducting state , but the harmonic response extends above @xmath9 into the pseudogap phase .",

    "an analytical finite - frequency field - based model of the nonlinear microwave response of superconducting thin films in a near - field microwave experimental configuration is presented .",
    "the interplay of inductive and resistive nonlinear effects arises naturally in the model , being an improvement with respect to previous models from the literature , which treat the two types of nonlinear behavior separately .",
