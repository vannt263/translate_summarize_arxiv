    "in the recent years the application range of gems ( gas electron multipliers ) @xcite in detector development has been widened up . besides the operation in detectors at high energy projects like hera - b @xcite , compass @xcite or dirac @xcite the gem is also used in gaseous photomultiplier development @xcite or x - ray imaging detectors @xcite .",
    "thereby , the gem is usually combined with other micro pattern devices like msgcs @xcite , mgcs @xcite , micromegas @xcite or microcat @xcite .",
    "also the cascade of multiple gems has been tested extensively @xcite .    a triple - gem cascade working as a detector for solar neutrino and dark matter search has been tested at high pressure of pure noble gases @xcite .",
    "high pressure is also desired in photon detection to increase quantum efficiency .",
    "if pure noble gases are not explicitly needed it is helpful to add a quench gas fraction of up to some @xmath2 to the noble gases .",
    "this leads normally to smaller charge diffusion , shorter signal lengths and the possibility to obtain higher gas gains .",
    "examinations of the gas gaining behaviour of alternative micro pattern devices like msgcs @xcite or the behaviour of a single gem / msgc - combination @xcite in noble gas / quench gas environments show that the maximum gain drops with pressure .",
    "the aim of our investigations is to test the performance of a triple - gem detector at higher pressures of noble gas / quench gas mixtures to increase the quantum efficiency for photon detection in the energy range of @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "we investigate the gas gain behaviour at different pressures and quench gas fractions .",
    "we examine the signal lengths which mainly affect the dead time .",
    "besides space charge effects the dead time limits the rate capability .",
    "the schematic setup of the triple - gem detector is shown in fig .",

    "the individual gem foils with dimensions of @xmath5 are glued under slight tension to a @xmath6 thick ceramic frame .",
    "the gem type is characterised by a hole pitch of @xmath7 and an optical transparency of @xmath8 ; the hole shape is double - conical with an inner diameter of about @xmath9 and an outer diameter of about @xmath10 .",
    "the holes are hexagonally arranged ; the thickness of the gem amounts to @xmath11 including two copper layers of @xmath12 each and a kapton thickness of @xmath9 .",
    "we have set the distance between the gems to @xmath13 .",
    "the lowermost gem is mounted at a distance of @xmath6 above the readout structure .",

    "in the following section we present results of gas gain measurements in the triple - gem configuration . the effective gain @xmath25 is experimentally determined by the quotient of the measured current at the anode @xmath26 and the `` incoming '' current @xmath27 : @xmath28 the current @xmath29 is determined by the conversion rate @xmath30 of the x - ray photons in counting mode of the detector , by the photon energy @xmath31 and by the average energy required to produce one electron - ion pair in the gas @xmath32 ; @xmath33 denotes the elementary charge .",
    "in fact , the incoming current @xmath27 is overestimated  at least at small drift fields and high gas pressures  because of charge losses due to recombination and attachment in the conversion region .",

    "the transfer fields have been chosen to @xmath34 , and we have applied an induction field of @xmath35 to avoid full discharge propagation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have set the gem voltages such , that the uppermost gem voltage is @xmath2 higher than the voltage of the middle gem ; the lowermost gem is set to an operation voltage @xmath2 smaller than the `` reference '' voltage of the middle gem @xmath40 .",
    "this setting assures minimum discharge rates @xcite .",
    "the sum of all applied gem voltages always amounts to @xmath41 .    for illumination with x - ray photons we have used a @xmath42 source , emitting photons with an energy of @xmath43 and with a rate of @xmath44 collimated to about @xmath45 . during all measurements",
    "the gas gain was found to decrease as a function of illumination time and photon rate most likely due to charging of the insulating kapton in the gem .",
    "the charging is dependent on illumination time and position , photon flux and dryness of the kapton surface .",
    "we can not explain why in our setup the gain decreased as a function of time , whereas gain increased in measurements of other groups ( i.e. @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the problem of charging of the kapton and hence of the time and rate dependent gas gaining behaviour may be solved by using carbon coated gas electron multipliers @xcite . in our case , however , all data has been taken after an equilibrium state had been reached .",
    "the gas gain measurements were limited by sparks .",
    "we stopped the measurements at spark rates @xmath46 , which is rather an arbitrary limit .",
    "important , however , is the stable detector operation at slightly lower voltages and hence lower gas gains .",
    "although quantum efficiency in argon mixtures for photon detection in the higher energy range is small compared to krypton or xenon mixtures we have carried out gas gain measurements in @xmath16 ( 70/30 ) to compare the results to those achieved with kr- and xe - mixtures . the measured effective gain , shown in fig .",

    "the effective gain exceeds @xmath49 up to pressures of @xmath36 . nevertheless , a quench gas fraction of @xmath51 is not well suited for operation at pressures @xmath52 where we obtained a strong decrease in gas gain to about @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast to that still large gas gains in the order of @xmath54 are possible with a carbon dioxide fraction of @xmath2 .",
    "the use of xe - based gas mixtures offers the largest quantum efficiency for photon detection in the energy range between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "gain variations of up to @xmath59 become obvious .",
    "these local variations are mainly due to two aspects : first , the gems , themselves , produce intrinsic gain inhomogeneities because of geometry variations .",
    "furthermore , the distances between the individual gems and the distance between undermost gem and anode are not constant over all the detector area , which leads to transfer and induction field inhomogeneities und finally to variations in the charge transfer behaviour and in the effective gas gain of the gems @xcite .",
    "we have measured the gas gain behaviour at different pressures of argon , krypton and xenon with additions of @xmath2 and @xmath51 of carbon dioxide .",
    "a strong influence of the quench gas fraction on the gas gain behaviour becomes obvious .",
    "it is definitely a non - trivial task to optimise the fraction of quencher at a given pressure with respect to a maximum achievable gain due to a complicated interplay of these parameters .",
    "generally , the maximum gas gain of the triple - gem achievable in slightly quenched noble gas mixtures is higher than in pure noble gases ( compare to refs .",
    "@xcite ) . at standard pressure",
    "the krypton and xenon gas mixtures with @xmath2 @xmath50 behave relatively similarly to the mixtures with @xmath51 @xmath50 . increasing gas pressure leads to a larger deviation in maximum achievable gas gain .",
    "higher pressure demands obviously for smaller quench gas fractions .    the strong influence of the quencher fraction indicates , that a stable avalanche process is not only based on electron - induced ionization of gas atoms .",
    "the uv - photons which are produced in the avalanche development may contribute noticeably to the multiplication procedure .",
    "with increasing pressure and constant ( or even larger ) quench gas fraction the mean free path of the uv - photons is decreasing .",
    "for instance , the deterioration in energy resolution in a mwpc is stopped when a very small quench gas fraction of only @xmath60 at very high pressures ( up to @xmath61 ) is added to argon @xcite . however ,",
    "still smaller fractions of quenching gas lead to an unsafe operation of the detector .",
    "we suppose , that the triple - gem detector shows a comparable behaviour . it should be considered to use very small quench gas fractions of a few percent for really high pressure operation .",
    "a good choice for photon detection with the triple - gem is the use of @xmath17 or @xmath18 ( 90/10 ) , depending on the energy range , at pressures between @xmath0 and @xmath36 .",
    "gas gains of @xmath62 can be easily reached without sparking .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the anode signal shape on gem voltage , induction field , transfer field and drift field for all gas mixtures and several pressures since the dead time behaviour of the detector is mainly determined by the signals lengths .",
    "the copper readout anode for these measurements has a size of @xmath63 .",
    "the integrating preamplifier and the shaper including a pole - zero filter to cancel the pole of the integrating first stage are in - house developments .",
    "the gaussian - like @xmath64-response of this amplification system has a width of @xmath65 ( fwhm ) due to bandwidth limitations .",
    "basically , the anode signal shape is determined by two aspects :    1 .",
    "a spatially @xmath64-like distributed electron cluster moving from the bottom side of the undermost gem towards the readout structure induces a box - shaped current at both involved electrodes if the electric field and therefore the electron drift velocity in the region of interest is assumed to be constant @xcite .",
    "the copper - clad bottom side of the gem shields all currents induced by charge movements appearing above this electrode ; especially the slow ions do not contribute to the signal shape , which is , however , the case for micromegas or microcat detectors @xcite .",
    "the crucial parameters for the width @xmath66 of the box - shaped current are the electron drift velocity @xmath67 in the electric field of the induction region and the distance @xmath68 between the bottom side of the gem and the anode which amounts to @xmath6 in our case : @xmath69 2 .",
    "the longitudinal diffusion @xmath70 of the primary produced electrons ( photoelectron plus subsequently produced about 300 electrons for @xmath71 photons in argon ) in the conversion region leads to a temporal gaussian smearing of the above mentioned box function , mathematically expressed by a convolution of box and gauss function .",
    "the width of the gaussian @xmath72 is determined by the longitudinal diffusion coefficient @xmath73 and the electron drift velocity @xmath67 in the applied drift field and gas mixture used and finally by the mean drift path @xmath74 of the primary produced electrons , which is dependent on photon energy , conversion gap and photoelectric absorption coefficient of the gas . additionally , the longitudinal electron diffusion in the two transfer regions between the gems and in the induction region between undermost gem and anode contribute to the temporal smearing @xmath75 . in our simulation",
    "this contribution has also been taken into account .",
    "for most gas mixtures and pressures in our detector setup the temporal diffusion spreading ( compare to eq .",
    "( [ eq_width ] ) ) is the main contribution which leads to a very much gaussian - like signal shape .",
    "[ fig_ssxe90ed1000 ]     in @xmath20 @xmath18 ( 90/10).,width=283 ]    shows a typical signal obtained at a high drift field of @xmath37 at standard pressure . at smaller drift fields the signal shape looks differently ( s. fig .",

    "the measured signal shape is not gaussian ( which means that the main contribution of the signal is due to the electron induced box - shaped current , which is true for very small induction fields ( s. section [ sec_induction ] ) ) eq .",
    "( [ eq_deconv ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "but in this case the measured signal width is very much larger than the width of the @xmath64-response ( @xmath78 ) and therefore the real signal width can be determined to be @xmath79 .    despite most gas properties",
    "are @xmath80-dependent all measurements have been performed with a constant transfer field of @xmath34 and a constant induction field of @xmath35 even at high pressure if not noted otherwise , since these electric fields ensure maximum electron transparency of the gem .",

    "the range of the investigated gem voltages was limited by the dynamic range of the preamplifier .",
    "anyway , the setting of the gem voltage is determined by the desired gas gain and is therefore no freely adjustable parameter for optimisation of the signal lengths .",

    "this effect is some relict due to the very high electric field in the holes . to determine the width of the electron induced box - shaped current we have used a parametrisation of the electron drift velocity , calculated by the magboltz programm @xcite , up to electric fields of @xmath85 .",

    "result in a slight increase of the signal width which can be explained by smaller electron drift velocities in the transfer regions and hence a larger diffusion spreading ( compare to eq .",

    "[ fig_ssxe90ed200 ] ) .",

    "the fastest signals with a signal length of @xmath94 ( fwhm ) are produced in the argon mixture at standard pressure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_slar70 ] ) .",
    "larger pressure always increases the signal width due to decreasing drift velocities in induction and conversion region and thus an increasing temporal smearing .",

    "the drift field has the most crucial influence on the signal length although for smaller conversion regions this parameter becomes less important due to smaller longitudinal electron diffusion .",
    "the drift field should be chosen as large as allowed by the detector setup .",
    "however , the drift field should not be too high ( @xmath97 ) because the uppermost gem loses transparency for too large drift fields @xcite .",

    "the measured signal lengths at high drift fields in all gas mixtures and pressures investigated are smaller than about @xmath100 ( fwhm ) .",
    "if transfer and induction fields exceed @xmath101 the signal widths get to minimum .",

    "<S> we investigate the gas gain behaviour of a triple - gem configuration in gas mixtures of argon , krypton and xenon with ten and thirty percent of carbon dioxide at pressures between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . since the signal widths affect the dead time behaviour of the detector we present signal length measurements to evaluate the use of the triple - gem in time - resolved x - ray imaging . </S>",
