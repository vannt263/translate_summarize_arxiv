    "the theoretical description of the electron structure of the magnetoexcitons and of the excitonic spectra in the gan - based quantum wells in wide range of the perpendicular magnetic fields up to 60 t was proposed in refs [ 2 - 4 ] , where the built - in strain and perpendicular electric field were taken into account .",
    "the pressure leads to the reordering of the topmost valence subbands having different symmetries .",
    "the exciton binding energies at different valence subbands give rise to the reordering of the corresponding optical transitions in the emission and absorption spectra .",
    "the reordering in the light - and heavy - hole valence subbands takes place also in dependence on the qw width .",
    "the latter is an important feature of the gan - type semiconductor and it leads also to a stepwise dependence of the excitonic g - factor .",
    "the electric field is perpendicular to the layer surface .",
    "it was taken into account together with the size quantization .",
    "the landau orbitals in refs [ 2 , 3 ] were generated by the ladder operators constructed using the lamb gauge transformation [ 5 ] .",
    "they concern only to the states with zero center - of - mass momentum , depend on coordinates of the relative electron - hole motion and act on the wave function of the ground state with the same coordinate dependence .",
    "contrary to the model of refs.[2 - 4 ] , below we will consider the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron - hole ( e - h ) system in a gaas - type structure with only one heavy - hole valence subband with infinitesimal qw width without any reference to the excited levels of the size quantization .",
    "we will consider the multilateral phenomena related with landau quantization accompanied by the rashba spin - orbit coupling , zeeman splitting and non - parabolicity of the heavy - hole dispersion law .",
    "all of them are induced in the 2d e - h system by the influence of the strong perpendicular magnetic and electric fields .",
    "we have followed the rashba basic paper [ 1 ] using the rising and the lowering operators in the space of the single - particle landau levels . in our case",
    "they depend exclusively on the electron and hole coordinates , avoiding their expressing through the relative and center - of - mass coordinates of the e - h pair .",
    "the corresponding functions were determined by the exact solutions [ 6 , 7 ] .",
    "the magnetoexciton wave function in coordinate representation when the electron and hole are situated on the lowest landau levels was obtained in refs [ 8 , 9 ] .",
    "it reflects the interdependence of the translational and relative motion of electron and hole in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "recently much attention was attracted to the influence of the magnetic field on the microcavity polaritons [ 10 - 14 ] . among many different nonlinear effects induced by the magnetic field",
    "one can mention the suppression of the polariton superfluidity and the density dependent zeeman splitting [ 12 , 14 ] .",
    "the transverse electric - tranverse magnetic ( te - tm ) splitting of the cavity modes , the faraday rotation of the plane polarization of the light passing through the microcavity , and the zeeman splitting of the exciton eigenstates were observed experimentally in refs [ 10 , 11 ] .",
    "the magnetic field was used as a tuning parameter for exciton and photon resonances [ 15 ] . in this way the change of the exciton energy , of the oscillator strength , of the polariton line width and the redistribution of the polariton density along the dispersion curve owning to the magnetically induced detuning were obtained .",
    "the increase of the exciton oscillator strength in dependence of the magnetic field strength @xmath14 observed experimentally [ 15 ] qualitativly agrees with the theoretical result of the ref [ 16 ] ( formula ( 12 ) ) , where the rabi frequency @xmath12 of the magnetoexciton polariton is inverse proportional to the magnetic length @xmath18 as @xmath19 .",
    "it means that the oscillator strength in this case is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "the evolution of the circularly polarized nonequilibrium bose - einstein condensates of the spinor - polaritons in different spinor states [ 13 ] , as well as the influence of the magnetic field on a spinor exciton polariton condensate in rectangular gaas microcavity pillars were investigated in [ 17 ] . the zeeman splitting and the diamagnetic shift of the exciton - polariton energy spectrum in an external magnetic field for different trap diameters have been studied in ref.[18 ] .",
    "the new hopefield [ 19 ] coefficients in the presence of the magnetic field and its influence of the relative weights of the photonic and excitonic components in the structure of the polariton branches were determined in ref .",
    "the combined exciton - cyclotron resonance in gaas - type qws was revealed experimentally in ref .",
    "[ 21 ] and explained theoretically in ref.[22 ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the wave functions and the eigenenergies of the 2d electron and heavy holes(hh ) undergoing the landau quantization ( lq ) , rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) and zeeeman splitting(zs )",
    "effects were reviewed .",
    "the main results in this field , in general forms were obtained in our previous papers cited below , but their detailed presentation needed for the subsequent applications is given in the present paper . at the same time in this section new results related with the dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction(dsoi ) were included .",
    "in the section 3 on the base of the above mentioned wave functions the hamiltonian describing in the second quantization representation the electron - electron coulomb interaction was deduced .",
    "the energy spectrum of the 2d magnetoexcitons arising in these conditions was determined .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the electron - radiation interaction , to the magnetoexciton - photon coupling and to the magnetoexciton - polariton formation .",
    "the sections 3 and 4 contain the main original results of our paper .",
    "their novelity is determined by the simultaneous taking into account of four important events such as the lq , rsoc , zs and the nonparabolicity of the hh dispersion law .",

    "<S> we consider the energy spectrum of the two - dimensional cavity polaritons under the influence of a strong magnetic and electric fields perpendicular to the surface of the gaas - type quantum wells ( qws ) with p - type valence band embedded into the resonators . as the first step in this direction </S>",
    "<S> the landau quantization ( lq ) of the electrons and heavy - holes ( hh ) was investigated taking into account the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) with third - order chirality terms for hh and with nonparabolicity terms in their dispersion low including as well the zeeman splitting ( zs ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> the nonparabolicity term is proportional to the strength of the electric field and was introduced to avoid the collapse of the semiconductor energy gap under the influence of the third order chirality terms . </S>",
    "<S> the exact solutions for the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies were obtained using the rashba method [ 1 ] . on the second step </S>",
    "<S> we derive in the second quantization representation the hamiltonians describing the coulomb electron - electron and the electron - radiation interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this allow us to determine the magnetoexciton energy branches and to deduce the hamiltonian of the magnetoexciton - photon interaction . on the third step the fifth order dispersion equation describing the energy spectrum of the cavity magnetoexciton - polariton is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it takes into account the interaction of the cavity photons with two dipole - active and with two quadrupole - active 2d magnetoexciton energy branches . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity photons have the circular polarizations @xmath0 oriented along their wave vectors @xmath1 , which has the quantized longitudinal component @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the resonator length and another small transverse component @xmath4 oriented in the plane of the qw . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d magnetoexcitons are characterized by the in - plane wave vectors @xmath5 and by circular polarizations @xmath6 arising in the p - type valence band with magnetic momentum projection @xmath7 on the direction of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the selection rules of the exciton - photon interaction have two origins . the first one , of geometrical - type , is expressed through the scalar products of the two - types circular polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> they depend on the in - plane wave vectors @xmath5 even in the case of dipole - active transitions , because the cavity photons have an oblique incidence to the surface of the qw . </S>",
    "<S> another origin is related with the numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the lq levels of electrons and heavy - holes taking part in the magnetoexciton formation . </S>",
    "<S> so , the dipole - active transitions take place for the condition @xmath10 , whereas in the quadrupole - active transitions the relation is @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the rabi frequency @xmath12 of the polariton branches and the magnetoexciton oscillator strength @xmath13 increase in dependence on the magnetic field strength @xmath14 as @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical gyrotropy effects may be revealed if changing the sign of the photon circular polarization at a given sign of the wave vector longitudinal projection @xmath17 or equivalently changing the sign of the longitudinal projection @xmath17 at the same selected light circular polarization . </S>"
