    "various different levels of description have been employed in order to study mixtures of colloidal particles and non - adsorbing globular polymers @xcite . while colloid - colloid interactions are reasonably well described by those of hard spheres , the effective interactions between colloids and polymers , as well as that between the centers of two polymers , are more delicate .",
    "the model due to asakura and oosawa @xcite and vrij @xcite ( aov ) , taking the colloids to be hard spheres and the polymer - polymer interactions to vanish , is arguably the most simple description of real colloid - polymer mixtures .",
    "its appeal clearly lies in its simplicity , rather than in very close resemblance of experimental colloid - polymer systems , enabling detailed simulation @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of bulk @xcite and interfacial @xcite properties .",
    "more realistic effective interactions between the constituent particles can be systematically obtained by starting at the polymer segment level , and integrating out the microscopic degrees of freedom of the polymers @xcite .",
    "the resulting colloid - polymer interaction is a smoothly varying function of distance , and excluded volume between polymer segments leads to a soft gaussian - like polymer - polymer repulsion .",
    "such effective interactions have been used to calculate bulk phase behavior @xcite .    in order to retain most of the simplicity of the aov model , but still to capture polymer non - ideality , the aov model was extended using a repulsive stepfunction pair potential between polymers in .",
    "the colloid - polymer interaction was kept as that of hard spheres .",
    "this introduces one additional model parameter , namely the ratio of stepheight and thermal energy , interpolating between the aov case when this quantity vanishes , and the additive binary hard sphere mixture when it becomes infinite . following the hard sphere @xcite and aov cases @xcite , the well - defined particle shapes of this model allowed to obtain a geometry - based density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite specifically tailored for this model @xcite .",
    "the theory can , in principle , be applied to arbitrary inhomogeneous situations , which constitutes an _ a posteriori _",
    "justification for using these model interactions .",
    "the trends found for the fluid - fluid demixing transition into a colloidal liquid phase ( that is rich in colloids and poor in polymers ) and a colloidal gas phase ( that is poor in colloids and rich in polymers ) , upon increasing the polymer - polymer interaction strength , demonstrated improved accordance with the experimental findings of , as compared to the aov case @xcite , where the dft predicts the same phase diagram as the free volume theory @xcite . furthermore the extended aov model was used in the study of the `` floating liquid phase '' that was found in sedimentation - diffusion equilibrium @xcite .",
    "further discussion of the model and its relation to the aov prescription is given in .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we want to assess in detail the accuracy of the dft of by comparing to results from direct simulations of the extended aov model .",
    "while phase - coexistence is often studied in the gibbs ensemble @xcite , we instead choose to take advantage of recently developed methods @xcite that rely on the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "benefits are accurate estimates of the interfacial tension @xcite and access to the critical region @xcite .",
    "the binodal we obtain in the simulations is compared to that from dft , and good agreement between both is found .",
    "this result strongly supports the original claim @xcite that a straightforward perturbation theory , taking the aov system as the reference state and adding polymer - polymer interactions in a mean - field like manner , will fail , as the bulk fluid - fluid binodal from this approach differs markedly from that of the geometry - based dft , as discussed in detail in .",
    "instead , even to lowest order in strength of the polymer - polymer interaction , a non - trivial coupling to the colloid density field needs to be taken into account ; the dft of does this intrinsically .",
    "our second aim is to study the interfacial tension between demixed colloidal gas and liquid phases , which is known from experiments @xcite , theory @xcite and simulation @xcite to be orders of magnitude smaller than that of atomic substances .",
    "while much work has been devoted to the case of non - interacting polymers @xcite , only quite recent studies addressed the effect of polymer non - ideality @xcite .",
    "aarts _ et al . _",
    "@xcite use a square gradient approach based on the free energy of a free volume theory , to include polymer interactions @xcite , and the mean spherical approximation for the direct correlation function .",
    "they find the gas - liquid interfacial tension to decrease as compared to the case of non - interacting polymers , when plotted as a function of the density difference in the coexisting phases .",
    "similar findings were reported by moncho - jord _",
    "et al._@xcite , who also used a square gradient approach , but based on an effective colloid - colloid depletion potential that reproduces simulation results accurately @xcite .",
    "our present study goes beyond refs .  , and also beyond the very recent , as we employ a non - perturbative dft treating the full two - component mixture of colloids and interacting polymers .",
    "we compare results for the interfacial tension to our data from direct simulation of the binary mixture . besides its intrinsic interest , the interfacial tension is moreover relevant for the occurrence of capillary condensation in confined systems @xcite as is apparent from a treatment based on the kelvin equation @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secmodel ] we define the extended aov model taking into account polymer - polymer repulsion . in sec .",
    "[ secmethods ] we briefly sketch the theoretical and simulation techniques . in sec .",
    "[ secresults ] results for fluid - fluid phase behavior and the interfacial tension are presented , and we conclude in sec .  [ secconclusions ] .",
    "we consider a mixture of hard sphere colloids ( species c ) of diameter @xmath0 , and effective polymer spheres ( species p ) of diameter @xmath1 , that interact via pairwise potentials @xmath2 with @xmath3 , as function of the center - to - center distance @xmath4 between two particles , given as @xmath5 particle numbers are denoted by @xmath6 , and as bulk thermodynamic parameters we use the packing fractions @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the system volume . as an alternative to @xmath9",
    ", we use the packing fraction @xmath10 in a reservoir of pure polymers , interacting via @xmath11 as given above , that is in chemical equilibrium with the system , with @xmath12 being the polymer number density in the reservoir .",
    "the model is characterized by two dimensionless control parameters , namely the polymer - to - colloid size ratio @xmath13 , and the scaled strength of polymer - polymer repulsion @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , @xmath16 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath17 the absolute temperature . as limiting cases",
    ", the present model possesses the aov model for @xmath18 , where polymer - polymer interactions are ideal , and the binary additive hard sphere mixture in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "one can use the parameter @xmath14 to match to a real system at a given thermodynamic statepoint , polymer type and solvent , by imposing equality of the second ( polymer - polymer ) virial coefficients . see for an in - depth discussion of this procedure .",
    "to investigate bulk and interfacial properties of the present model , we use the geometrically - based dft of that has its roots in generalizations of rosenfeld s fundamental - measure theory for additive hard sphere mixtures @xcite , namely the treatment of the `` penetrable sphere model '' @xcite ( equivalent to the present polymer particles ) and the dft genuinely developed for the aov model @xcite .",
    "the minimization of the grand potential is carried out with a simple iteration technique .",
    "we refer the reader directly to for all details about the ( approximate ) helmholtz free energy functional .",
    "the simulations are carried out in the grand canonical ensemble , where the fugacities @xmath20 and @xmath21 , of colloids and polymers , respectively , and the total volume @xmath8 are fixed , while the numbers of particles , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are allowed to fluctuate .",
    "we use a rectangular box of dimensions @xmath24 , with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions , and simulate the full mixture as defined by the pair potentials given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : potcc])-([eq : potpp ] ) , i.e.  the positional degrees of freedom of both colloids and polymers are explicitly taken into account .",
    "note that _ asymmetric _ binary mixtures are in general difficult to simulate , and prone to long equilibration times . to alleviate this problem ,",
    "we rely on a recently developed cluster move  @xcite , that has already been applied successfully to the standard aov model @xcite . here",
    "we perform the generalization to @xmath25 which is straightforward .    during the simulation",
    ", we measure the probability @xmath26 of finding a certain colloid packing fraction @xmath27 . at phase coexistence ,",
    "the distribution @xmath26 becomes bimodal , with two peaks of equal area , one located at small values of @xmath27 corresponding to the colloidal gas phase , and one located at high values of @xmath27 corresponding to the colloidal liquid phase .",
    "typical coexistence distributions for the standard aov model can be found in , and our present results display similar behavior . the equal area rule @xcite implies that @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the average of the full distribution @xmath30 , where we assume that @xmath26 has been normalized to unity @xmath31 .",
    "the packing fraction of the colloidal gas @xmath32 now follows trivially from the average of @xmath26 in first peak @xmath33 , and similarly for the colloidal liquid @xmath34 , where the factors of 2 are a consequence of the normalization of @xmath26 .",
    "the interfacial tension @xmath35 is extracted from the logarithm of the probability distribution note that @xmath36 corresponds to the free energy of the system .",
    "therefore , the height @xmath37 of the peaks in @xmath38 , measured with respect to the minimum in between the peaks , equals the free energy barrier separating the colloidal gas from the colloidal liquid @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 may be related to the interfacial tension @xmath35 by noting that , at colloid packing fractions between the peaks @xmath39 , the system consists of a colloidal liquid in coexistence with its vapor . a snapshot of the system in this regime ,",
    "would reveal a so - called slab geometry , with one region dense in colloids , and one region poor in colloids , separated by an interface ( because of periodic boundary conditions , two such interfaces are actually present ) .",
    "if an elongated simulation box with @xmath40 is used , rather than a cubic box with @xmath41 , the interfaces will be oriented perpendicular to the elongated direction , since this minimizes the interfacial area , and hence the free energy of the system .",
    "the total interfacial area in the system thus equals @xmath42 and , following , @xmath43 .",
    "an additional advantage of using an elongated simulation box is that interactions between the interfaces are suppressed .",
    "this enhances a flat region in @xmath38 between the peaks , which is required for an accurate estimate of the interfacial tension . in this work , an elongated box of dimensions @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "is used .",
    "close to the critical point the simulation moves back and forth easily between the gas and liquid phases , while further away from the critical point , i.e.  at higher polymer fugacity , the free energy barrier between the two phases increases .",
    "hence transitions from one to the other phase become less likely , and the simulation spends most of the time in only one of the two phases . a crucial ingredient in our simulation",
    "is therefore the use of a biased sampling technique .",
    "we employ successive umbrella sampling , as was recently developed by virnau and mller @xcite , to enable accurate sampling in regions of @xmath27 where @xmath26 , due to the free energy barrier separating the phases , is very small . in this approach , states ( or windows ) are sampled successively . in the first window",
    ", the number of colloids is allowed to vary between 0 and 1 , in the second window between 1 and 2 , and so forth .",
    "the number of polymers is allowed to fluctuate freely in each window .",
    "our sampling scheme is thus strictly one - dimensional : the bias is put on the colloid density only .",
    "note that this becomes problematic for very large systems because of droplet formation .",
    "an additional free energy barrier , which grows with the size of the simulation box , must be crossed before the transition from the droplet state , to the slab geometry occurs ( which is required if the interfacial tension is to be determined ) . as pointed out in refs .  ,",
    "this additional barrier is not one in colloid density , but rather in the energy - like parameter , which for our system would be the polymer density .",
    "hence , for very large systems , a naive one - dimensional biasing scheme such as described above , is prone to severe sampling difficulties ( more appropriate in this case would be a two - dimensional sampling scheme in both the colloid _ and _ the polymer density ) .",
    "for the system size used by us , however , no problems in obtaining the slab geometry were encountered .    in this work ,",
    "we simulate up to a colloid packing fraction of @xmath46 , corresponding to a maximum of around 1000 colloidal particles .",
    "the maximum number of polymers is obtained at low @xmath27 .",
    "while the precise number depends on @xmath47 and @xmath14 , a value of 3000 is typical . in each window , @xmath48 grand canonical cluster moves are attempted , of which @xmath49 are accepted at low @xmath27 , and @xmath50 at high @xmath27 ( the grand canonical cluster move thus becomes less efficient with increasing colloid packing fraction ) .",
    "the typical cpu time investment to obtain a single distribution @xmath26 is 48  hours on a moderate computer .",
    "in fig .  [ figpdsystem ] we plot results for the bulk fluid - fluid demixing binodal as obtained from theory and simulation in the @xmath51-plane , i.e.  the `` system representation '' . for the aov case ( recovered for @xmath18 )",
    ", the dft predicts the same bulk free energy for fluid states , and hence the same demixing binodal , as free volume theory @xcite .",
    "the result is known to compare overall reasonably well with simulation results for a variety of size ratios @xmath52 , but to deviate close to the critical point @xcite . for increasing strength of the polymer - polymer repulsion , the theoretical critical point shifts toward higher values of @xmath27 , and very slightly to lower values of @xmath9 . the accompanying shift of the binodal leads to a growth of the one - fluid region in the phase diagram , hence polymer - polymer repulsion tends to promote mixing .",
    "the simulation results indicate the same trend , but show a quantitatively larger shift of the binodal toward higher values of @xmath27 upon increasing @xmath14 .",
    "note also the pronounced finite - size deviations of the simulation data in the vicinity of the critical point . as a result ,",
    "the slight decrease in the critical value of @xmath9 with increasing @xmath14 , as predicted by dft , can not be identified in the simulation data .",
    "to better access the critical region , a finite size scaling analysis @xcite would be required .",
    "while such an investigation has been carried out for the standard aov model @xcite , it would require extensive additional simulations for the extended model , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "when plotted in the @xmath53-plane or `` reservoir representation '' , the theoretical results display a similar shift of the binodal toward larger values of @xmath27 , and considerable broadening of the coexistence region , see fig .",
    "[ figpdreservoir ] .",
    "this implies that at a given value of @xmath47 above the critical point , increasing the polymer - polymer repulsion leads to a larger density difference between the coexisting phases .",
    "the broadening of the coexistence region is strikingly confirmed by the simulation data .",
    "we again observe an overall shift of the binodals toward higher values of @xmath27 . in accordance with findings for the standard aov model @xcite , the critical value of @xmath47 obtained by dft underestimates the simulation value .",
    "this is related to the universality class of the aov model , which is that of the 3d ising model @xcite , and hence , close to criticality , deviations from a mean - field treatment like the present dft are to be expected .    in fig .",
    "[ figgammadeltaeta ] , we show results for the gas - liquid interfacial tension , @xmath35 , plotted as a function of the difference between the colloid packing fraction in the coexisting phases , @xmath54 . both dft and simulation indicate that the interfacial tension decreases markedly upon increasing @xmath14 , in accordance with square - gradient treatments @xcite .",
    "note that this change is not due to interfacial contributions alone , but also to the pronounced changes in the location of the bulk demixing binodal discussed above .",
    "the decrease might seem reasonable based on the profound increase in the density of the coexisting liquid upon increasing @xmath14 , see again the phase diagram in reservoir representation ( fig .",
    "[ figpdreservoir ] ) . as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ figpdreservoir ] , a given value of @xmath55 corresponds to a reduction of @xmath47 at coexistence upon increasing @xmath14 .",
    "we believe that this decrease induces the observed decrease in @xmath35 .",
    "alternatively , comparing the interfacial tension as a function of @xmath47 thus reveals an _ increase _ with increasing @xmath14 , see the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figgammareservoir ] which shows the dft result .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ figgammareservoir ] shows the corresponding simulation data .",
    "the increase in the interfacial tension with increasing @xmath14 is confirmed up to @xmath56 , but not for @xmath57 .",
    "the simulation data for the latter case , however , should be treated with some care , as in grand canonical simulations , the quantity @xmath47 does not play the role of a direct control parameter , which rather the polymer fugacity , @xmath21 , does .",
    "consequently , conversion to the reservoir representation requires an additional step , namely the determination of @xmath47 as a function of @xmath21 . with the exception of @xmath18 , in which case @xmath58 holds",
    "trivially , this conversion introduces an additional statistical uncertainty . fig .",
    "[ figpdreservoir ] shows that , for @xmath57 , the binodal has become very flat , so even small uncertainties in @xmath47 imply rather large uncertainties in @xmath55 .",
    "hence , for very flat binodals , the reservoir representation is not convenient in simulations ( more reliable in this case is the system representation , see fig .",
    "[ figgammadeltaeta ] , which , as a benefit , is experimentally more relevant ) .",
    "a second point is that the monte carlo cluster move becomes less efficient with increasing @xmath27 and @xmath14 ( see ref .  ) and this will also adversely affect the data ( especially for @xmath57 , since then both @xmath14 and @xmath59 are substantial ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the shift of the simulation data for @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ figgammareservoir ] most likely reflects a simulation artifact .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the effect of polymer - polymer repulsion on the fluid - fluid demixing phase behavior and on the ( colloidal ) liquid - gas interface of a model colloid - polymer mixture .",
    "we have used a simplistic pair potential between polymers , given by a repulsive stepfunction , to extend the standard aov model to cases of interacting polymers .",
    "grand canonical monte carlo simulations of the full mixture demonstrate the reasonable accuracy of the theory , with a tendency to quantitatively underestimate the shifts in the bulk fluid - fluid demixing binodal , and the gas - liquid interfacial tension , upon increasing strength of the polymer - polymer repulsion .",
    "the present study demonstrates the usefulness of the model as such , as it clearly displays previously found features due to polymer non - ideality .",
    "this offers ways to study further interesting inhomogeneous situations , like the wetting properties at substrates .",
    "such investigations could test the robustness of the results obtained for the surface phase behavior at a hard wall using ideal polymers @xcite .",
