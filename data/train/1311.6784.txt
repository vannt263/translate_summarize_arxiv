    "quantum correlations are in the heart of a number of quantum effects such as quantum nonlocality @xcite , the speedup @xcite , and unambiguous state discrimination @xcite . even more , quantum correlations are the key ingredient for implementing processes between distant particles , for instance , the teleportation of unknown state @xcite and the remote state preparation @xcite . thus , quantum correlations become fundamental resources for attaining novel quantum effects . in this context , quantum correlations have been well characterized hitherto by the so - called entanglement and quantum discord @xcite .",
    "the discord can be generated by starting from a separable classical state and using local operations and classical communication @xcite ; whereas the preparation of a bipartite entangled state requires a direct interaction of the particles at their common past .",
    "the entanglement - swapping @xcite procedure does not infringe the above statement since it simply redistributes quantum correlation between different parts of two composed systems .",
    "the advantage of this process lies in the fact that two factorized parts can acquire entanglement even though they are away from each other and from the other parts .",
    "numerous are the experimental realizations reported in the literature which account for some application of the entanglement - swapping process @xcite ; recently it has been demonstrated that entanglement can be swapped to timelike separated quantum systems @xcite .    in this work",
    "we propose a generalization of the basic entanglement - swapping scheme by considering two pairs of qubits being initially correlated via @xmath0-states instead of pure ones .",
    "we start by showing that the basic entanglement - swapping process redistributes the entanglement when we consider pure and partially entangled states . in this case ,",
    "two of the four outcome states are maximally entangled and the other two have entanglement smaller than the input one .",
    "this motivates us to study the process by considering two pairs of qubits prepared initially in mixed states , specifically the @xmath0-types for which there is an analytical expression for the concurrence @xcite .",
    "we focus with special interest on analyzing the entanglement redistribution accomplished in this process .",
    "further and major motivations for studying @xmath0-states stem from the fact that they are usually encountered in different areas ; for instance , some decoherence mechanisms can take two qubits to an @xmath0-state @xcite , two two - level atoms in the tavis - cummings model can reach a dynamics @xmath0-state @xcite , the states with minimum and the states with maximum discord for a fixed entanglement value are @xmath0-states @xcite , in condensed matter the ground state of two @xmath1-symmetry sites of a lattice is represented by an @xmath0-state as well @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec . [ pure state ]",
    "we expose the principal aspects of the entanglement - swapping process with pure states . in sec .",
    "[ x - state ] we describe the main properties of an @xmath0-state . in sec .",
    "[ 2xstate ] we address the entanglement - swapping scheme starting with two different @xmath0-states . in sec .",

    "[ rhodifferent ] where the entanglement is partially redistributed .",
    "finally , in the last section we summarize our results .",
    "in this section we describe the principal aspects of the entanglement - swapping schemes with pure states .",
    "let us consider the simplest case of two pairs of qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 prepared in the bell states @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure0 ] .",
    "the entanglement - swapping protocol can readily be read out of the identity @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the bell states of the systems @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the eigenstates of the pauli operator @xmath12 of the respective system . from ( [ swapingpure ] )",
    "we realize that by implementing a measurement process , which projects the qubits @xmath13 and @xmath14 onto one of their bell states , then the pair of qubits @xmath15 are projected also onto one of their bell states .",
    "each one of the four results has the same probability @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , by projecting onto the bell basis of the qubits @xmath17 the entanglement contained in the two pairs @xmath2 and @xmath3 is redistributed to the pair @xmath15 , even though there is no interaction between them .    when the two pairs of qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 initially are in partially entangled pure states the identity ( [ swapingpure ] ) becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "note that by projecting the qubits @xmath13 and @xmath14 onto one of the bell states @xmath21 the pair @xmath15 is projected as well onto one of the bell states @xmath22 with probability @xmath23 , otherwise when the pair @xmath17 is projected onto one of the bell states @xmath24 the composed system @xmath15 also is projected onto one of the partially entangled states @xmath25 with probability @xmath26 . thus , even though the initial entanglement @xmath27 is not maximal , there are two possible outcome states maximally entangled",
    ". however , the other two resulting states have amount of entanglement @xmath28 smaller than the initial ; even more , the average outcome entanglement @xmath29 is smaller than the initial one @xmath27 .",
    "we illustrate that behavior of the redistributed entanglement in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , as functions of @xmath30 .",
    "we note that the four outcome states are maximally entangled only for @xmath31 , which is the case of the identity ( [ swapingpure ] ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing three affairs ; i ) the outcome entanglement is maximal with probability @xmath32 , which vanishes only at the end values @xmath33",
    ", @xmath34 where there is no input entanglement , ii ) the probability of increasing the entanglement is always smaller than the one for decreasing it , since @xmath35 , iii ) for having entangled outcome states it is required to have initial entanglement different from zero only . finally , we want to emphasize that there is an asymmetry in the distribution of the entanglement over the four outcome states , which in the identity ( [ swapingpure2 ] ) looks with favor on the @xmath22 outcome bell states .",

    "here we review succinctly the properties of a general @xmath0-state @xmath39 of two qubits @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in the logic basis",
    "@xmath42 the state is represented by the matrix @xmath43 in order for ( [ xstate ] ) to describe a quantum state , the matrix elements must satisfy the normalization @xmath44 and the positivity conditions , @xmath45 in what follows we consider _ fixed diagonal elements _ and we do the analysis in terms of the off - diagonal elements .",
    "the off - diagonal elements account for the coherence degree inside two orthogonal subspaces , say , @xmath46 spanned by the basis @xmath47 and @xmath48 spanned by @xmath49 . for instance , when @xmath50 there is absolute decoherence into @xmath46 , while for @xmath51 there is a pure state into @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath52 element has similar meaning in the subspace @xmath48 .",
    "accordingly , depending on the moduli @xmath53 and @xmath54 the @xmath0-state ( [ xstate ] ) goes from an incoherent superposition of the four factorized logic states to an incoherent superposition of two partially entangled pure states .",
    "there are two special features of an @xmath0-state : i ) the @xmath0 form in itself which arises because it populates the two subspaces @xmath46 and @xmath48 without having off - diagonal terms between the elements of those subspaces , ii ) the entanglement between the two involved systems",
    ".    the entanglement can be evaluated by the concurrence @xcite , which for the ( [ xstate ] ) state is given by @xcite , @xmath55 thus , there is nonzero entanglement when one of the two following inequalities is satisfied : @xmath56 otherwise entanglement is absent . complementing inequalities ( [ rhooverrho ] ) with those for positivity ( [ positivity ] ) , leads to the following two inequations for having entanglement :    @xmath57    clearly only one or none of them can be fulfilled .",
    "we extract in the following three sentences what the inequalities ( [ eqfore ] ) are saying to us :    * for @xmath58 it is necessary that @xmath59 .",
    "* for @xmath58 it is necessary and sufficient to have a certain nonzero coherence degree inside only one subspace @xmath46 or @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "* the coherence degree into the other subspaces , @xmath62 , does not contribute to @xmath63 ; even more , @xmath62 can be zero and even then it does not affect the amount of entanglement of the @xmath0-state . *",
    "the entanglement dies just when the @xmath64 .",
    "we stress that , for fixed diagonal elements , the maximum amount of entanglement is reached by satisfying condition i ) and having total coherence into only one subspace @xmath46 or @xmath48 in agreement with condition ii ) .",
    "the inequations ( [ eqfore ] ) define , in the composed hilbert space , the border between the entangled and the separable @xmath0-states .",
    "let us consider two pairs of qubits @xmath36,@xmath13 and @xmath37,@xmath14 .",
    "the qubits @xmath13 and @xmath14 are in the same laboratory , in this way local and joint operations can be applied on them .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 qubits are spatially remote from each other and from qubits @xmath13 and @xmath14 , accordingly , it is not possible to perform joint operations onto @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure0 ] .",
    "we assume that , at the common past , both pairs of qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 were prepared in the @xmath0-states @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which we call input states . in the respective logic bases @xmath67 and @xmath68 the input states are represented by the matrices @xmath69 now we consider that a projective measurement is performed over the qubits @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "specifically , onto the factorized state @xmath70 is applied a von neumann measurement , which projects the pair @xmath17 onto one of the four bell states    @xmath71    consequently the pair @xmath15 also experiments a projection onto one of the states @xmath72 or @xmath73 , which we call outcome states . in the logic basis",
    "@xmath74 the outcome states are represented by the matrices    @xmath75    @xmath76    [ xrhoab ]    where we have defined the normalization constants , @xmath77 the probabilities of obtaining each one of the four possible outcomes ( [ xrhoab ] ) are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we can note that the four possible outcomes , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are @xmath0-states as well .",
    "this means that the @xmath0-feature of the input states of pairs @xmath2 and @xmath3 is swapped to the state of the pair @xmath15 .",
    "the diagonal elements of the outcomes ( [ xrhoab ] ) depend only on the diagonal elements of the input state , and the off - diagonal elements of ( [ xrhoab ] ) depend on the off - diagonal elements of the input states .",
    "thus , both terms @xmath80 and @xmath52 affect and contribute to the coherence into both subspaces @xmath46 and @xmath48 of the pair @xmath15 .",
    "the two states @xmath81 and @xmath82 are equivalent by means of local unitary operators , say , @xmath83 or @xmath84 ; this means that they have equal amounts of quantum correlation .",
    "similarly , the states @xmath85 and @xmath86 are equivalent with the same local unitary operators",
    ". however , the two states @xmath87 , in general , are not local - unitarily equivalent to the two @xmath88 states .",
    "therefore , in this process the entanglement is distributed probabilistically with concurrence @xmath89 in the two outcomes @xmath87 and with @xmath90 in both states @xmath88 , which , in general , are different .",
    "this asymmetric distribution is reminiscent of the case exposed in sec .",
    "[ pure state ] for pure states .    from eqs .",
    "( [ xrhoab ] ) we realize that the matrix elements of @xmath65 are transferred to the outcome states of pair @xmath15 when the state @xmath91 . in this particular case ,",
    "the states @xmath87 are local - unitarily equivalent with the @xmath88 states respectively by means of the local unitary transformation @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "this means that in this process , all the features of the @xmath0-state @xmath65 are transferred to the state of the two remote qubits @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in order to simplify the analysis and to shed some light on the principal aspects and the scope of this scheme , in the next sections we restring it to the case with elements of the matrices ( [ xstates ] ) equal , i.e. , @xmath94",
    "in what follows we analyze the entanglement redistribution from @xmath2 and @xmath3 pairs to the @xmath15 system , when both initial @xmath0-states ( [ xstates ] ) are alike , i.e. , @xmath94 . in this case , the concurrences of the respective outcome states ( [ rhoabphi ] ) and ( [ rhoabpsi ] ) become    @xmath95    [ cabs ]    where we have defined the function @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 being the phase of the off - diagonal elements , i.e. , @xmath99 .    the concurrence @xmath100 does not depend on the phases @xmath98 and it is higher than @xmath101 for all values of @xmath102 . in addition to having asymmetrically distributed the entanglement over the outcomes , the probability @xmath103 of having @xmath100 is smaller than the one @xmath104 of having @xmath101 .",
    "the concurrence @xmath101 reaches its maximal value at @xmath105 and the minimum for @xmath106 . taking into account that the relative phases @xmath98 can be managed by properly choosing the axes on the bloch sphere of the qubits",
    ", we can assume @xmath107 , which leads to @xmath105 .",
    "in this case the concurrences ( [ cabs ] ) become    @xmath108    [ cpshi0 ]    from these expressions we find that the four outcome states ( [ xrhoab ] ) are entangled if the matrix elements of the input states satisfy the inequality @xmath109 whereas the entanglement is present only in two outcome states ( [ rhoabpsi ] ) if the following inequalities hold : @xmath110 otherwise the four outcomes states are separable .    by making a detailed analysis of the inequalities ( [ positivity ] ) , ( [ rhooverrho ] ) , ( [ eqfore ] ) , ( [ ineinf ] ) , and ( [ algo ] ) we can asseverate what follows :    * if the input states @xmath65 and @xmath66 are not entangled then @xmath111 and @xmath112 . the suitably multiplication of the respective terms of these inequalities with those for positivity @xmath113 and @xmath114 leads to @xmath115 and @xmath116 . adding them we obtain that @xmath117 , which means that the right hand side inequality of expression ( [ ineinf ] ) is not fulfilled .",
    "this means that , if the input states lack entanglement , then the four outcome states are separable .",
    "+ additionally , the fact that the concurrence @xmath63 of the input states is different from zero does not guarantee that the outcomes states are entangled . specifically , by considering that @xmath118 , we find that : * only the two outcome states @xmath119 have entanglement different from zero if @xmath120 * the entanglement is present in the four outcome states @xmath119 and @xmath121 if @xmath122    the two threshold concurrence values are @xmath123    these threshold values are decreasing functions of the off - diagonal element @xmath124 , which does not affect the amount of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we can realize that , when the input states have entanglement , the off - diagonal term @xmath124 now plays an important roll for achieving the task of having entanglement in the outcomes .",
    "in fact , it allows to decrease the threshold values and to increase the outcomes entanglement . in other words",
    ", the coherence degree inside the respective subspace helps to increase the entanglement of the outcome states , when the input states have entanglement , of course .",
    "consequently , the outcome concurrence ( [ cpshi0 ] ) reaches the maximum value when there is maximal coherence inside both subspaces @xmath46 and @xmath48 , namely @xmath51 and @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , in this case and for fixed diagonal elements , the highest outcome concurrence is @xmath126 and the smallest outcome concurrence becomes @xmath127 here , we easily note that @xmath128 is higher and @xmath129 is smaller than the input one @xmath63 .",
    "note that ( [ cmax3 ] ) is different from zero when @xmath130 and @xmath131 or @xmath132 and @xmath133 , which are conditions for having initial entanglement , in agreement with inequality ( [ algo ] ) evaluated for maximal coherence .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , in order to get in the process maximal outcome entanglement , it is required to manipulate the initial states ( [ xstates ] ) in such a way that @xmath107 .",
    "this can be done by applying the local unitary operation @xmath134 to the @xmath13 and the @xmath14 qubits , before performing the measurement procedure .",
    "here we have found two threshold concurrence values , conditions for which this scheme allows redistributing entanglement onto two remote qubits .",
    "the entanglement is distributed asymmetrically onto four possible outcomes , thus having probabilities different from zero of increasing and decreasing it with respect to the initial entanglement .",
    "moreover , the probability of increasing it is smaller than the one for decreasing it .",
    "we show two examples which illustrate the effect produced by the smallest module of the off - diagonal term of the input states on the outcome entanglement . in the cases with werner states and with @xmath135-states the module @xmath136 ; consequently the outcomes demand input states with finite entanglement . in the case with input @xmath137-states the module @xmath138 ; accordingly the outcome entanglement arises for all @xmath139 similarly to the input state .",
    "the relation between discord , entanglement of formation ( eof ) , and linear entropy was addressed in ref .",
    "a. al - qasimi and d.f.v .",
    "james found the states for which discord takes extreme values for a given entropy or given entanglement .",
    "the upper bound of entanglement - discord relation is given by the @xmath135-state for @xmath140eof@xmath141 .",
    "the lower bound of that relation is satisfied by the @xmath137-state for @xmath140eof@xmath142 .",
    "thus , in this section we analyze the outcome states ( [ xstates ] ) when input states are both @xmath135 or both @xmath137 .    before developing these examples",

    "<S> the basic entanglement - swapping scheme can be seen as a process which allows to redistribute the bell states properties between different pairs of a four qubits system . </S>",
    "<S> achieving the task requires performing a von neumann measurement , which projects a pair of factorized qubits randomly onto one of the four bell states . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we propose a similar scheme , by performing the same bell - von neumann measurement over two local qubits , each one initially being correlated through an @xmath0-state with a spatially distant qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this process swaps the @xmath0-feature without conditions , whereas the input entanglement is partially distributed in the four possible outcome states under certain conditions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we obtain two threshold values for the input entanglement in order for the outcome states to be nonseparable . besides </S>",
    "<S> , we find that there are two possible amounts of outcome entanglement , one is greater and the other less than the input entanglement ; the probability of obtaining the greatest outcome entanglement is smaller than the probability of achieving the least one . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we illustrate the distribution of the entanglement for some particular and interesting initial @xmath0-states . </S>"
