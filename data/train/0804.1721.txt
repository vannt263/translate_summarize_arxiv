    "for several decades it has been now possible to use adaptive optic ( ao ) systems to actively correct the distortions affecting an incident wavefront propagating through a turbulent medium .",
    "a particularly interesting application of this technique is in the field of astronomical ground - based imaging .",
    "the idea behind ao systems is to generate a corrected wavefront as close as possible to the genuine incident plane wavefront thanks to a deformable mirror ( dm ) .",
    "an ao system is also composed of a wavefront sensor measuring the resulting distortion of the collected wavefront after correction by the dm . based on these measured signals , the voltage applied to the piezoelectric actuators is computed in order to reshape the mirror .",
    "the tilts ( first order modes ) of the wavefront are corrected by a first mirror .",
    "then , the dm is part of the control - loop for the correction of higher - order modes of the wave front .",
    "different types of sensors ( curvature sensor , pyramid wavefront sensor ) may be used to estimate the distortions affecting the incoming wave - front but the most common encountered in existing applications is the shack - hartmann ( sh ) sensor .",
    "there also exists different type of deformable mirrors and we choose to study the case of the most common one . for additional details on basic principles of adaptive optics ,",
    "see @xcite , e.g ..        this paper is devoted to the design of control laws for an adaptive optics system formed by a bimorph mirror and a shack - hartmann sensor ( see figure [ principe ] ) . most often , the existing adaptive optics systems use static models and very basic control algorithms based on frequent measurements of the influence of each actuator of the mirror to each output of the sh .",
    "this allows the computation of an interaction matrix gathering the corresponding influence functions . here",
    ", our goal is to consider the design of an adaptive optics system control loop from a modern automatic control point of view as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this means first that dynamics of the different elements involved in the control - loop have to be taken into account .",
    "in particular , a specific dynamic model for the dm is proposed for control purpose ( as already presented in @xcite and see also @xcite ) . secondly",
    ", a state - space model of the turbulent phase , built from its frequency domain characteristics , is defined @xcite .",
    "the main contribution concerns the infinite dimension setting introduced in this paper .",
    "more precisely , while in the literature , only static finite dimensional models are considered , a model based on a particular partial differential equation ( pde ) is used for the dm .",
    "we believe that our point of view matches well with the reduction of the size of the actuators and the significant augmentation of their numbers in many devices , as in ao for very large telescopes .    in reference",
    "@xcite , a thin elastic plate model of a deformable bimorph mirror is derived .",
    "this model is based on a periodic distribution of embedded piezoelectric patches that may be used as sensors or actuators .",
    "the idea is then to elaborate a robust control strategy based on modern control tools for distributed parameter systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , we do not need to compute any interaction matrix modelling the relation between the input on the piezoelectric patches attached to the mirror and the output given by the shack - hartmann sensor .",
    "the interaction matrix can be seen as a static model of the mirror whereas a more general dynamical model of the mirror is used here . + for the sake of clarity of this study , we emphasize here the main informations about the frame we choose for our modeling of robust control of an ao system .",
    "we consider a continuous time state - space model of an ao loop ( as in @xcite and instead of a discrete one in @xcite and @xcite ) and without delay . in practice",
    "an ao system uses discrete wavefront sensing data with inherent temporal delays and of course it is possible to derive a discrete time extension of our model but it is not our point here , even if we recognize that the performance will somehow be affected .",
    "our contribution relies mainly on the new pde model of the dm and we aim at using the @xmath1  control theory for infinite dimension setting in order to recover at least similar performance as the one of lqg control for a standard model of the dm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one should notice that our model depends only on a few physical parameters ( such as the density , the stiffness ... see the _ bimorph mirror model _",
    "subsection below for more details ) , parameters that could be considered as uncertain quantities the control law should take into account .",
    "therefore , we do not need either to compute an interaction matrix ( which is more and more complicate to compute when the number of the sensors and of the actuators increases as for very large telescopes ) , or the inverse of this interaction matrix @xcite . + the control problem is solved using an @xmath1  control setting .",
    "the first motivation is that @xmath1  control theory provides intrinsic properties of robustness while optimizing on the worst - case performance .",
    "another motivation is the multivariable nature of the control problem involved in adaptive optics system design @xcite .",
    "current adaptive optics control systems use decoupling modal control to rewrite the original problem as several decoupled single input single output control problems .",
    "because @xmath1  control framework may easily handle a multivariable dynamic model of the bimorph dm in the synthesis process , the obtained robust controller outperforms usual static control approaches of the literature .",
    "in addition , the use of hinfinity controllers induces , in general , some robustness properties of the closed - loop while @xmath2/@xmath3 controllers ( privileged in general , see @xcite ) lead to improvement of the performance but with no robustness guarantee ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so far , we do not claim to have solved the complete problem of aos synthesis ( with delays and limitations of performance introduced by sampling ) but we think that this new setting will probably address fundamental issues encountered in the very large telescopes context .",
    "this work is meant to illustrate the realizability of such an approach on realistic instances of aos design .",
    "+ the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "first , the adaptive optics control system is described ( see section [ 2 ] ) through the presentation of the models of the bimorph mirror and the turbulent phase .",
    "the third section is dedicated to the robust @xmath1  control setting in the infinite dimension framework and its formulation in our particular case .",
    "the last section contains the description of the truncated model and the numerical results .",
    "the bimorph mirror is composed of a purely elastic and reflective plate equipped with piezoelectric actuators ( in order to deform the shape of the mirror ) and piezoelectric sensors ( to measure the effective deformation ) . a shack - hartmann sensor then analyzes the resulting phase @xmath4 of the wavefront , after reflection in the deformable mirror of the turbulent phase @xmath5 . + different types of disturbances have to be faced with : @xmath6 represents unstructured uncertainty ( neglected dynamics ) affecting the model , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are noise signals respectively attached to piezoelectric and shack - hartmann sensors . finally , @xmath5 is the turbulent phase of the wavefront introduced by the atmospheric perturbation .",
    "+ we denote by @xmath9 the transverse displacement of the circular mirror at point of polar coordinates @xmath10 and time @xmath11 , while @xmath12 is the light wavelength . the corrected phase produced by @xmath13 is then given by @xmath14 leading to a resulting phase : @xmath15 the optic sensor s output , computed by shack - hartmann sensor is : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a modelling parameter of the perturbation .",
    "+ finally , we note that the control input is the voltage @xmath18 applied to the piezoelectric actuators and the corresponding piezoelectric output is the voltage @xmath19 measured with the piezoelectric inclusions used as sensors ( see equations ( [ plate ] ) and ( [ piezooutput ] ) below ) .",
    "indeed , in comparison with many other devices , where the only information used to compute the voltage @xmath18 comes from the wavefront analyzer , the additional possibility of measuring the deflection of the mirror through a layer of piezoelectric sensors ( see figure [ principe ] ) is considered here .",
    "it is recalled that the goal of the adaptive optics control system is to minimize the resulting phase of the wavefront using shack - hartmann measurements .      to obtain the model of a bimorph mirror ( see an outline in @xcite ) , we consider three different layers .",
    "one is purely elastic and reflective , the second one is equipped with piezoelectric inclusions used as actuators , the third one is equipped with piezoelectric inclusions used as sensors . the heterogeneities are periodically distributed . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors derive the following dynamical model of the mirror ( a partial differential equation with respect to @xmath20 ) : @xmath21 with the initial conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the voltage @xmath19 computed by the piezoelectric sensors is given by @xmath24 the following notations are defined :    * @xmath10 are the spatial coordinates of a point of the disk @xmath25 of radius @xmath26 and @xmath11 is the time ; * @xmath27 is the laplacian operator and for a general function @xmath28 in polar coordinates @xmath29 * @xmath18 is the voltage applied to the inclusions of the actuator layer ; * @xmath30 is the surface density , @xmath31 is the poisson ratio of the mirror s material , @xmath32 is the stiffness coefficient and @xmath33 is a correction coefficient ; * @xmath34 and @xmath35 are proportional to the piezoelectric tensor coefficient @xmath36 ( for more physical details see @xcite ) ; * @xmath37 and @xmath38 are linear applications on appropriate spaces ; * @xmath6 and @xmath39 are unknown perturbations modelling the model errors of the plate equation and the measurement noise of the piezoelectric output .",
    "the boundary conditions are those of the free edges case ( vlt and the experimental device sesame , see subsection  [ numerical ] ) : @xmath40      in order to complete our optics system model , we need to develop a model of the turbulence phase .",
    "a usual representation of atmospheric phase distortion is made through the orthogonal basis of zernike polynomials because the first zernike modes correspond to the main optical aberrations .",
    "an infinite number of zernike functions is required to characterize the wavefront , but a truncated basis is used in general for implementation purpose .",
    "note that a 14-th order approximation contains 92% of the phase information , without taking into account the piston mode which represents the average phase distortion @xcite .",
    "the tip / tilt modes are not part of our modelling of the turbulent phase because of their correction by a dedicated mirror .",
    "we will therefore work with the @xmath41 first modes of zernike given in reference @xcite and recalled here ( see table [ zernike ] ) , excluding the three first ones .    .",
    "first 15 zernike functions [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we simulate only the @xmath41 modes which follow the tip / tilt .",
    "the performance of the control system is evaluated by considering the spatial norm @xmath42 of @xmath4 compared to @xmath43 : @xmath44 for identical random initial conditions and taking the respective weights of the disturbance signals such that @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 for all @xmath48 , we obtain the results represented in figure [ turbulence ] .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath49 ( dashed line),width=340 ]    using monte carlo simulations , the ratio between temporal average of @xmath43 and @xmath49 is near to 1.91 which represents a phase distortion attenuation of the reflected wavefront of @xmath50 .",
    "in addition one should recall that this result does not take into account the tip / tilt correction . even if these results are of the same order of magnitude as those presented in @xcite , which can not be considered as completely satisfactory when considering usual results on real experiments , they clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach .",
    "the possible degradation of such a performance induced by the delay in the loop and the discretization of the control law for implementation purpose could darken the picture .",
    "it must be recalled that this apparent loss of performance is mainly due to the tuning of the trade - off between robustness and performance that is inherently encountered in closed - loop feedback design .",
    "numerous improvements have still to be considered as presented in the next conclusion .",
    "in this paper , a new framework to deal with the problem of adaptive optics is proposed .",
    "it is mainly based on an infinite - dimensional model of the deformable mirror associated with the definition of a standard model on which robust control techniques may be applied .",
    "the preliminary numerical experiments show a performance level comparable with the results of reference @xcite . the main advantage of the approach suggested in this paper is that no interaction matrix is required to control the system .",
    "we do not pretend to outperform already existing ao systems but rather to pave the way for future major improvements in terms of robustness and efficiency of the proposed control strategies .",
    "the authors are planing to take into account a model for the shack - hartmann wavefront sensor including a time delay associated with processing measurements .",
    "this will be covered in a next study .",
