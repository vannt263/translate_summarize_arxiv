    "the transfer of quantum state between two distant quantum registers is an essential task of quantum information processing ( qip)@xcite .",
    "while long - range quantum communication can be realized by the use of photons@xcite , coupled solid - state systems can act as quantum data buses to connect two separated registers for short - range communication , e.g. , within a computer .",
    "such data buses have been explored in the context of various quantum systems ranging from trapped ions@xcite and super - conducting flux qubits@xcite to cavity arrays@xcite and nanoelectromechanical oscillators@xcite . due to the ability to provide an alternative to either direct register interactions or an interface between stationary and flying qubits ,",
    "quantum spin chains have attracted much attention in recent years @xcite . in the original scheme@xcite , s. bose studied a uniform spin chain of heisenberg coupling , and quantum information can be efficiently transferred between two ends of the spin channel via natural evolution . moreover ,",
    "many strategies aiming to achieve the perfect quantum state transfer ( qst ) over arbitrary distance have emerged , such as engineering the coupling strength in a way dependent of the chain length@xcite , implementing local measurements of individual spins@xcite and designing some special configurations of spin chains@xcite .",
    "alternatively , coherent quantum coupling has been widely used to achieve high - fidelity qst by tuning the registers to interact weakly with the channel@xcite .",
    "compared to two - dimensional systems working as qubits , high - dimensional systems as qudits also deserve to explore because they can carry large capacity and lead to a further insight into our understanding of quantum physics . until now",
    ", many proposals of quantum computation@xcite and quantum communication , e.g. quantum cloning@xcite , quantum teleportation@xcite , quantum key distribution@xcite and quantum correlation@xcite have been extended to high - dimensional versions . indeed , with some notable exceptions@xcite , where perfect high - dimensional state transfer over long distance has been implemented by utilizing a repeated measurement procedure or a free spin wave approximation , prior work on perfect qst in coupled - spin systems has primarily focused upon qubits@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we devote our attention to a perfect transfer of high - dimensional quantum state through an @xmath0-heisenberg coupling spin chain of arbitrary length in an inhomogeneous magnetic field . on employing the holstein - primakoff transformation and the free spin wave approximation , the hamiltonian takes the form of free bosons and can be diagonalized through an orthogonal transformation . tuning the register - bus coupling in the @xmath2 plane to be much smaller than that within the data bus enables a special data bus collective eigenmode resonating with the two end registers . as a consequence ,",
    "unitary evolution results in a perfect swap operation between the two registers in the optimal time , and numerical simulations are performed to confirm it .",
    "moreover , we observe that increasing either the strong @xmath1-directional coupling or high quantum spin number is capable of protecting quantum information from the thermal noises .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the analysis of the model and give the hamiltonian . in section 3 , we show that a high fidelity qst and the thermal effects . finally , we summarize the whole mechanism and draw our conclusions in the section 4 .",

    "( c ) on maintaining @xmath7 , there is a special data bus collective mode being resonantly coupled to the two registers , and off - resonant coupling can be neglected .",

    "[ f4](a ) , it should be noted that the @xmath1-directional coupling contains the spin - wave interaction found in nonlinear terms of the hp transformation , and such coupling can lead to the leakage of quantum information , specially at very low temperature range .",

    "when the quantum data bus is in the thermal equilibrium state , the effects of the temperature on the state transfer protocol have also been numerically studied .",
    "in contrast to previous work on @xmath109 coupling spin chains , an additional @xmath1-directional coupling can depress the thermal excitations and partly counteract the thermal effects to ensure the feasibility of the present method . with its scalability and robustness , this protocol may be applicable in a high - dimensional solid device for quantum information processing .",
