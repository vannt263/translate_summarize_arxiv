    "soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are a class of compact objects that show interesting observational properties see e.g. mereghetti ( 2008)@xcite : rotational periods in the range @xmath0@xmath1 s , a narrow range with respect to the wide range of ordinary pulsars @xmath2@xmath3 s ; spin - down rates @xmath4@xmath5 , larger than ordinary pulsars @xmath6 ; strong outburst of energies @xmath7@xmath8 erg , and for the case of sgrs , giant flares of even large energies @xmath9@xmath10 erg , not observed in ordinary pulsars .",

    "al.(2010)@xcite , and an x - ray luminosity of @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 can be considered as the rosetta stone for alternative models of sgrs and axps .    the magnetar model , based on a neutron star of fiducial parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 km and a moment of inertia @xmath17 g @xmath18 , needs a magnetic field larger than the critical field for vacuum polarization @xmath19 g in order to explain the observed x - ray luminosity in terms of the release of magnetic energy see @xcite for details .",
    "the inferred upper limit of the surface magnetic field of sgr 0418 + 5729 @xmath20 g describing it as a neutron star see rea et .",
    "al.@xcite for details , is well below the critical field , which has challenged the power mechanism based on magnetic field decay in the magnetar scenario .",
    "alternatively , it has been recently pointed out how the pioneering works of morini et .",
    "al.@xcite and paczynski@xcite on the description of 1e 2259 + 586 as a white dwarf ( wd ) can be indeed extended to all sgrs and axps .",
    "these wds were assumed to have fiducial parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 km , @xmath23 g @xmath18 , and magnetic fields @xmath24 g see @xcite for details inferred from the observed rotation periods and spin - down rates .",
    "the energetics of sgrs and axps including their steady emission , glitches , and their subsequent outburst activities have been shown to be powered by the rotational energy of the wd @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of a glitch , the associated sudden shortening of the period , as well as the corresponding gain of rotational energy , can be explained by the release of gravitational energy associated with a sudden contraction and decrease of the moment of inertia of the uniformly rotating wd , consistent with the conservation of their angular momentum .    by describing sgr 0418 + 5729 as a wd , we calculated @xcite an upper limit for the magnetic field @xmath25 g and",
    "show that the x - ray luminosity observed from sgr 0418 + 5729 can be well explained as originating from the loss of rotational energy of the wd leading to a theoretical prediction for the spin - down rate @xmath26 where the lower limit was established by assuming that the observed x - ray luminosity of sgr 0418 + 5729 coincides with the rotational energy loss of the wd .",
    "as we will show below , these predictions can be still improved by considering realistic wd parameters @xcite instead of fiducial ones .",
    "the situation has become even more striking considering the recent x - ray timing monitoring with swift , rxte , suzaku , and xmm - newton satellites of the recently discovered sgr swift j1822.31606 @xcite .",
    "the rotation period @xmath27 s , and the spin - down rate @xmath28 have been obtained . assuming a ns of fiducial parameters , a magnetic field @xmath29 g is inferred , which is again in contradiction with a magnetar explanation for this source .",
    "we have recently computed in @xcite general relativistic configurations of uniformly rotating white dwarfs within hartle s formalism @xcite .",
    "we have used the relativistic feynman - metropolis - teller equation of state @xcite for wd matter , which we have shown generalizes the traditionally used equation of state of salpeter@xcite .",
    "it has been there shown that rotating wds can be stable up to rotation periods of @xmath30 s ( see @xcite and sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] for details ) .",
    "this range of stable rotation periods for wds amply covers the observed rotation rates of sgrs and axps @xmath0@xmath1 s.    the aim of this article is to describe one of the so - called _ low magnetic field magnetars _ , sgr 0418 + 5729 as a massive fast rotating highly magnetized wd . in doing",

    "the loss of rotational energy associated with the spin - down of the wd is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the moment of inertia of the wd in units of @xmath33 g @xmath18 .",
    "this rotational energy loss amply justifies the steady x - ray emission of all sgrs and axps see @xcite for details .",
    "the upper limit on the magnetic field see e.g. @xcite obtained by requesting that the rotational energy loss due to the dipole field be smaller than the electromagnetic emission of the magnetic dipole , is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mean radius of the wd in units of @xmath36 cm . the mean radius",
    "is given by @xmath37 see e.g. @xcite with @xmath38 and @xmath39 the equatorial and polar radius of the star .",
    "it is clear that the specific values of the rotational energy loss and the magnetic field depend on observed parameters , such as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as well as on model parameters , such as the mass , moment of inertia , and mean radius of the rotating wd .",
    "the rotational stability of fast rotating wds was implicitly assumed by malheiro et .",
    "al.@xcite . the crucial question of whether rotating wds can or can not attain rotation periods as short as the ones observed in sgrs and axps has been recently addressed by boshkayev et .",
    "the properties of uniformly rotating wds were computed within the framework of general relativity through hartle s formalism @xcite .",
    "the equation of state for cold wd matter is based on the relativistic feynman - metropolis - teller treatment @xcite , which generalizes the equation of state of salpeter@xcite .",
    "the stability of rotating wds was analyzed taking into account the mass - shedding limit , inverse @xmath42-decay instability , and secular axisymmetric instability , with the latter determined by the turning point method of friedman et .",

    "the gray - shaded region is the stability region of rotating white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the numbers show the period @xmath40 in seconds . ]",
    "the minimum rotation period @xmath45 of wds is obtained for a configuration rotating along the keplerian ( the mass shedding ) sequence , at the critical inverse @xmath42-decay density , namely this is the configuration lying at the crossing point between the mass - shedding and inverse @xmath42-decay boundaries .",
    "the numerical values of the minimum rotation period @xmath46 s and the maximum masses @xmath47 were found for helium ( he ) , carbon ( c ) , oxygen ( o ) , and iron ( fe ) wds , respectively ( see boshkayev et .",
    "al.@xcite , for details ) . as a byproduct ,",
    "these values show that indeed all sgrs and axps can be described as rotating wds because their rotation periods are in the range @xmath48 s.    the relatively long minimum period of rotating fe wds , @xmath49 s , lying just at the lower edge of the observed range of rotation periods of sgrs and axps , reveals crucial information on the chemical composition of sgrs and axps , namely they are very likely made of elements lighter than fe , such as c or o.    it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : consomj ] that every @xmath44=constant or equivalently @xmath40=constant sequence intersects the stability region of general relativistic uniformly rotating wds ( @xmath50-@xmath38 curves inside the shaded region of fig .",
    "[ fig : consomj ] ) in two points .",
    "these two points determine the minimum(maximum ) and maximum(minimum ) @xmath51(@xmath52 ) , respectively , for the stability of a wd with the given rotation angular velocity @xmath53 .",
    "associated with the boundary values @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we can obtain the corresponding bounds for the moment of inertia of the wd , @xmath54 , respectively .",
