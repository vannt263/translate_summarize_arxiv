    "polymer solutions are very interesting soft - matter systems , showing a wide variety of behaviors , depending on density , temperature , architecture , etc.@xcite due to the large number of atoms belonging to a single macromolecule , simulations of polymer systems are quite challenging .",
    "for this reason , during the years many attempts have been made to develop coarse - grained ( cg ) models in which only some _ relevant _ degrees of freedom are retained , in such a way to reproduce some large - scale structural properties and the thermodynamic behavior .",
    "@xcite in the simplest approach one maps polymer chains onto point particles interacting by means of the pairwise potential of mean force between the centers of mass of two _ isolated _ polymers .",
    "@xcite since the potentials are computed in the limit of zero polymer density , this approach is limited to the dilute regime , in which many - body interactions @xcite can be neglected .",
    "this limitation was overcome ten years ago,@xcite by introducing pair potentials depending on the polymer density , thus allowing the model to reproduce exactly the thermodynamics at any given density .",
    "this work has paved the way to the use of soft effective particles to represent polymer coils in complex situations such as in modelling colloid - polymer mixtures.@xcite however , deriving density - dependent potentials requires full - monomer simulations at finite polymer density , which is what one would like to avoid by using cg models .",
    "moreover , care is needed to derive the correct thermodynamics @xcite and to compute free energies and phase diagrams.@xcite    these limitations can be overcome by switching to a model at a lower level of coarse graining , i.e. by mapping a long linear polymer to a short linear chain of soft effective blobs .",
    "@xcite quite recently , extending an older phenomenological approach,@xcite ref .   proposed a multiblob model .",
    "as in the models proposed in refs .  , the potentials do not depend on polymer density and are fixed by using structural data obtained in the limit of zero polymer density .",
    "however , at variance with the other approaches , the radius of each blob , which should be identified with its radius of gyration , is not fixed but is allowed to fluctuate .",
    "the idea is very appealing and the model is , in principle , more realistic , since blobs are compressible : when the density increases , the average blob radius of gyration decreases as it does in the original polymer model .",
    "therefore , this model should provide a more accurate description of the structural properties of the polymers . however , its practical implementation is by no means straightforward .",
    "a phenomenological approach was proposed in ref .  ,",
    "in which intermolecular and intramolecular potentials appropriate for polymers under good - solvent conditions were determined by combining exact results for ideal chains and some approximate predictions for good - solvent polymers that allowed the inclusion of the local self - repulsion .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to test the approach of ref .   for polymers under good - solvent conditions .",
    "we consider a single - blob system and carefully compare the results obtained for the model with radii - dependent potentials with those obtained for the simpler model in which the blob size is fixed .",
    "the simplicity of the cg single - blob model allows us to compute the pair potentials from full - monomer simulations of two isolated chains , avoiding any approximation , thus allowing us to distinguish between the merits / demerits of the method from those of the approximations which are needed to implement it .",
    "moreover , we can discuss two different approaches to the coarse graining : in the first one each polymer is represented by a soft  compressible \" sphere located in the polymer center of mass ( this is the most common approach when dealing with linear polymers ) ; in the second one the position of the sphere coincides with that of the central monomer ( star - polymer studies favor this second option ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.2 ] we define the models we investigate . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we present our results : in sec .  [ sec.3.1 ] we discuss the third virial coefficient and the zero - density three - body forces , while in sec .",
    "[ sec.3.2 ] we compare the results for the compressibility factor , the center - of - mass ( or polymer midpoint ) pair distribution function , and the distribution of the radius of gyration in the semidilute regime . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec.4 ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this paper polymers are represented as  compressible \" soft spheres of radius @xmath0 : two spheres of radii @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , interact by means of the pair potential @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the relative distance .",
    "the radius of each sphere is allowed to fluctuate .",
    "we assume that the normalized radius distribution for an isolated sphere is given by the function @xmath5 . for a system of @xmath6 spheres in a volume @xmath7",

    "more specifically , we consider a polymer model , in which each polymer consists of @xmath14 monomers located in @xmath15 . as usual",
    "we define the radius of gyration of the chain as @xmath16 and its average over all polymer configurations as @xmath17 .",
    "we indicate zero - density averages with a hat , so that @xmath18 is the average radius of gyration of a single isolated polymer . it is a function of @xmath14 and for @xmath19 ( scaling limit ) it scales as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath4 are model - dependent constants and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are universal exponents . for good - solvent polymers",
    "they are known quite precisely:@xcite @xmath24 , @xmath25 . to define @xmath5 we consider the distribution of the radius of gyration of an isolated polymer , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the statistical average over all the conformations of an isolated polymer made of @xmath14 monomers . in the scaling limit @xmath28 ,",
    "the adimensional quantity @xmath29 is a universal function of @xmath30 , which we identify with @xmath5 : @xmath31 scaling corrections decay as @xmath32 , where @xmath23 is the same universal correction - to - scaling exponent appearing in eq .  ( [ hatrg ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath5 satisfies @xmath33 the second equation being a direct consequence of the definition of @xmath34 . to define the potential , we first consider the model in which the cg spheres are located in the centers of mass of the polymers .",

    ", the polymer center - of - mass pair distribution function in the limit of zero polymer density is the same as the zero - density pair distribution function between the centers of the spheres .",
    "hence , the polymer thermodynamics is correctly reproduced in the low - density limit by the effective model .",
    "cc    it is important to stress that the quantities @xmath5 and @xmath3 are _ universal _ ,",
    "i.e. the same result is obtained by using any model that is appropriate to describe polymers under good - solvent conditions .",
    "one could use the well - known lattice self - avoiding walk model or any off - lattice model appropriate to describe good - solvent polymers , for instance the bead - rod model of ref .  .",
    "we will use the lattice domb - joyce model with @xmath47 ( see ref .   for details on the model ) . in the scaling limit @xmath19",
    "such a model describes polymers under good - solvent conditions .",
    "morever , for our particular choice of the parameter @xmath48 , the scaling corrections proportional to @xmath32 that appear in eqs .",
    "( [ defp ] ) and ( [ v - def ] ) are very small , so that we can obtain the asymptotic ( scaling ) functions @xmath5 and @xmath3 from simulations of chains of moderate length .",
    "the results we shall present are obtained by using chains with @xmath49 .",
    "we have also performed simulations with @xmath50 : the corresponding results are fully compatible with those obtained using @xmath49 , indicating the absence of relevant finite - length effects . in practice , we simulate two independent domb - joyce chains using the highly - efficient pivot algorithm @xcite ( we perform @xmath51 pivot trial moves on each of them ) and determine numerically @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "then , we define @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 ( analogous relations hold for @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) and @xmath59",

    "[ fig : potcm ] .",

    "this is of course expected , since the smaller @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , the more compact the two walks become .",
    "hence repulsion should increase .",
    "for the same reasons , the range of the potentials decreases as the radii decrease .    in ref .",
    ", on the basis of a heuristic argument , it was suggested that the pair potentials could be approximately written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a constant independent of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "the results are then compared with the phenomenological expression @xmath73 , obtained using potential ( [ vvbk ] ) .",
    "we observe reasonable agreement for @xmath74 , while significant discrepancies are observed for @xmath75 . however , this is exactly the region which does not contribute significantly to @xmath76 , hence to the thermodynamics .",
    "c +    up to now we have characterized the polymer position by using its center of mass : in definition ( [ v - def ] ) @xmath4 represents the distance between the two centers of mass , expressed in units of @xmath34 : @xmath46 .",
    "this is the usual choice for cg models of linear polymers . on the other hand , when considering star polymers , it is much more common to consider cg models in which the star position is identified with the position of the ramification point , the center of the star.@xcite if we view linear polymers as two - arm star polymers , it is natural to define the cg model using the central monomer as polymer position . in an exact mapping",
    "this choice would be ininfluential for the thermodynamics.@xcite however , since all @xmath77-polymer interactions with @xmath78 are neglected in the cg model , different choices of the point associated with the polymer position give rise to cg models with different thermodynamic behavior .",
    "it makes therefore sense to study the different possibilities , with the purpose of understanding which is the optimal one .",
    "we thus also study two different cg models in which the polymer position is given by the central monomer @xmath79 .",
    "we consider a model in which polymers are represented by identical spheres interacting by means of the potential of mean force @xmath80 where now the average is over all isolated polymer pairs such that the central monomers ( midpoints , mp ) are in the origin and in @xmath81 , respectively , and @xmath46 .",

    "in this section we compare the thermodynamic behavior of the models we have introduced in the previous section :    * the standard cg model in which polymers are identical soft spheres interacting with a potential which only depends on distance .",

    "second , the cg model which uses the center of mass as reference point appears to be more accurate than that using the central monomer . for @xmath92 , which is the expected boundary of applicability of single - blob models , models m1a and m2a predict @xmath90 with an error of 9% , while model m2b underestimates @xmath90 by 14% .",

    "this should not be considered as a problem of the method , but rather as consequence of the single - blob model , which is only expected to work in the dilute regime . to perform a more quantitative comparison we consider the ratio @xmath100 where the average is performed at polymer volume fraction @xmath101 .",

    "[ dist - rg - phi ] , but this is not surprising for a single - blob model .",
    "in this paper we have performed a detailed study of single - blob models @xcite which are characterized by a fluctuating sphere radius and by density - independent potentials which are such to reproduce the radius - of - gyration distribution for an isolated polymer and the center - of - mass ( or midpoint ) polymer distribution function in the limit of zero polymer density .",
    "the results have been compared with those obtained in simpler single - blob models with fixed blob radius with the purpose of understanding if cg models based on compressible blobs provide a more accurate description of the thermodynamic behavior than fixed - radius cg models .",
    "since we use single - blob models , this comparison can only be made in the dilute regime @xmath104 , in which polymer overlaps are rare .",
    "as far as the thermodynamics and the intermolecular structure are concerned , we find that cg models that use the radii - dependent potentials behave no better than those in which polymers are represented by fixed - size spheres .",
    "however , the models with compressible soft spheres allow one to reproduce correctly ( at least in the dilute regime in which single - blob models are expected to be predictive ) the density dependence of the radius of gyration . for this quantity , the midpoint representation gives more accurate results .",
    "the fact that models with fluctuating sphere size and models with fixed sphere size have the same thermodynamic behavior is probably related to the fact that the radius of gyration is not the relevant length scale at finite density .",
    "if one wishes to improve the accuracy of the model , one should take into account overlaps which are characterized by a different length scale , the de gennes - pincus correlation length @xmath105 , which scales as @xmath106 with @xmath107 in the semidilute limit.@xcite to describe the semidilute regime , only multiblob approaches appear to be viable coarse - graining methods . in this respect , on the basis of the present results , we do not expect the approach of vettorel _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to be more accurate for the thermodynamics than the more straightforward approach of refs .  : considering compressible soft blobs should not provide a model which gives a more accurate description of the polymer thermodynamics than those in which the blob size is fixed .",
    "indeed , both representations equally fail to take into account blob overlaps .",
    "of course , a compressible soft - blob model would reproduce better the density dependence of some structural properties , like the average radius of gyration and the form factor .",
    "one of the difficulties of multiblob approaches is the determination of the intra- and inter - molecular potentials.@xcite for models with compressible blobs , a direct numerical determination appears unfeasible , hence phenomenological approaches must be used . ref .",
