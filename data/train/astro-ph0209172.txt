    "in this paper we continue determining orbital periods @xmath0 for su - uma type dwarf novae and candidate su uma stars .",
    "the su uma stars are dwarf novae , generally with @xmath2 h , which occasionally undergo bright and long - duration eruptions , called superoutbursts . during superoutburst",
    "they show quasi - periodic photometric oscillations , called superhumps , which have periods a few per cent _ longer _ than @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite gives an excellent discussion of these stars ( and cataclysmic binaries in general ) . at this time",
    "the most compelling explanation of the superhump clock invokes precession of an eccentric accretion disk @xcite .",
    "such disks are expected to develop in high mass ratio ( hence short - period ) cataclysmic binaries .",
    "the stars reported on here all prove to have @xmath1 h , yet to our knowledge none of them have well - observed superhumps or superoutbursts .",
    "most of the stars in this sample should show superhumps in the future .",
    "the superhump periods can then be combined with the independently determined orbital periods to compute the superhump period excess @xmath3 , which in turn appears to correlate well with the mass ratio @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the time - resolved spectra are from the mdm observatory 2.4-m hiltner telescope at kitt peak .",
    "table 1 gives a journal of the observations .",
    "we used the modular spectrograph , a 600 line mm@xmath5 grating , and a @xmath6 thinned tektronix ccd as the detector .",
    "the spectra covered from 4200 to 7500   at almost exactly 2   pixel@xmath5 , with a slightly undersampled spectral resolution of @xmath7   fwhm .",
    "individual exposures were generally @xmath8 minutes to avoid phase smearing at short orbital periods , and frequent comparison exposures maintained the wavelength calibration .",
    "observations of flux standard stars yielded a relative flux scale , but an unmeasurable and variable fraction of the light was lost at the @xmath9 spectrograph slit , and the sky was not always photometric , so the accuracy of the absolute flux calibration is probably @xmath10 per cent .",
    "the time - averaged , flux - calibrated spectra appear in fig .  1 , and table 2 gives measurements of the emission lines .    we used convolution methods @xcite to measure velocities of the h@xmath11 emission lines ( table 3 , available in the electronic edition ) .",
    "the velocity uncertainties in table 3 were computed by propagating the counting - statistics estimates of the errors in each spectrum channel through the convolution .",
    "2 shows results of period searches on these velocities , computed using the ` residual - gram ' method described in @xcite .",
    "table 4 gives parameters of sine fits of the form @xmath12\\ ] ] and the rms scatter @xmath13 around the best fits . in cases where they can be checked",
    ", cataclysmic binary emission lines seldom reflect the velocity amplitude of the white dwarf accurately , so we caution against using these parameters to compute masses .",
    "note that zero phase occurs at apparent inferior conjunction of the emission - line source .",
    "2 also shows the velocities folded on the adopted periods with the best - fitting sinusoids superposed .    for ft cam",
    "we also obtained differential time - series photometry with the mdm mcgraw - hill 1.3 m telescope . a schott bg38 filter and",
    "a thinned site ccd yielded a nonstandard broad blue - visual passband .",
    "each image had 256@xmath14 binned ( @xmath15 ) pixels , with an image scale of @xmath16 per binned pixel .",
    "we obtained 223 exposures of 30 s each , spanning 135 min .",
    "the reduced images were measured using the iraf implementation of daophot , and the instrumental magnitudes from individual exposures were adjusted to correct for transparency variations .",
    "no absolute calibration was attempted .",
    "an automated routine matched star images in the pictures to objects in the usno a2.0 catalog @xcite and generated astrometric plate solutions accurate to @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite obtained a spectrum of kx aql showing strong , broad emission lines . the large outburst amplitude",
    "( 12.5 to fainter than 18 ) , emission - line morphology , and absence of a secondary absorption spectrum led them to suggest that kx aql is a short period , su uma - type system .",
    "@xcite list it as a candidate wz sge - type star .",
    "the period we find , 86.91(3 ) min , is rather longer than wz sge and its ilk . also , there is not any clear sign of absorption around h@xmath18 from the underlying white dwarf , as is found in wz sge and gw lib at minimum light @xcite .",
    "ft cam was discovered by @xcite who designated it var 64 cam , and found a range from 14.0 to fainter than 17.6 in b. definite variations were noted around minimum light .",
    "@xcite reported photometry through an outburst , pointed out that the known outbursts have all been rare and short in duration , and derived a proper motion of @xmath19 arcsec yr@xmath5 .",
    "superoutbursts and superhumps have not been detected .",
    "the line spectrum appears typical for a dwarf nova , with a slight doubling of the emission lines ; the peaks of h@xmath11 are separated by @xmath20 km s@xmath5 . in the mean spectrum the violet peaks of the lines are stronger than the red peaks , which may be an artifact of uneven phase coverage .",
    "the continuum level implies @xmath21 .",
    "our data are from two observing runs ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the more extensive 2002 january data yield @xmath22 d , but the number of cycle counts between this and the 2002 february run is ambiguous .",
    "periods within 5 standard deviations of the best january period are given by @xmath23 / n$ ] , where @xmath24 is an integer .",
    "figure 3 shows the time - series photometry of ft cam .",
    "very strong flickering is present , amounting to almost 1 magnitude peak - to - peak , but no eclipse is evident .",
    "the flickering is strong enough that a shallow eclipse might escape detection .    comparing our direct images with the usno a2.0 yields a barely significant displacement of ft cam corresponding to @xmath25 mas yr@xmath5 in position angle 353@xmath26 , corroborating the proper motion found by @xcite .",
    "pu cma is the optical counterpart of the rosat source 1rxs j064047.8@xmath27242305 .",
    "several outbursts have been seen , and in one outburst kato and uemura ( vsnet alter number 3980 ) suspected an oscillation which might have been the beginnings of a superhump . .",
    "the emission lines are only slightly double - peaked in the average spectrum , indicating a rather low orbital inclination .",
    "the observed continuum implies @xmath28 , quite bright for a relatively unstudied object .",
    "the radial velocity data span a 6.8-h range in hour angle , despite the unfavorable declination of @xmath29 ; this and the good signal - to - noise resulted in an unambiguous period determination .",
    "the period , 81.63(6 ) min , is the shortest in the present sample and is essentially equal to that of wz sge .",
    "the low velocity amplitude @xmath30 ( table 3 ) also suggests a relatively low inclination .    as with ft cam ,",
    "the data set spans two observing runs , creating ambiguity in the long - term cycle count .",
    "the more extensive 2002 january data yield @xmath31 d. including the 2002 february data constrains the period to @xmath32 / n$ ] , where the integer @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite obtained photometry during an outburst which reached @xmath34 ; at minimum the magnitude is _ estimated _ as 19 , so the amplitude is approximately 5 mag .",
    "a spectrum obtained by @xcite appears normal for a dwarf nova near minimum light . our spectrum ( fig .",
    "1 ) appears similar , with single - peaked balmer lines which suggest a relatively low orbital inclination .",
    "the continuum indicates @xmath35 .",
    "the period , 112.60(12 ) min , is the longest in the present sample .",
    "the emission lines are single - peaked , indicative of a low orbital inclination . dm lyr is the only star in this sample for which we are aware of a superhump period , namely 0.066 d listed by @xcite in their table 1 .",
    "however , the details of this determination remain unpublished , and the quoted accuracy is insufficient to compute an accurate superhump period excess @xmath36 . our spectroscopy is from two observing runs separated by two years , which yielded a weighted mean @xmath37 d. precise periods which fit both runs lying within four standard deviations of the weighted mean are given by @xmath38 / n$ ] , where the integer @xmath39 .",
    "none of these five stars appears particularly unusual . they all prove to have periods in the range occupied by the su uma stars .",
    "superhumps are evidently detected ( but not well measured ) in dm lyr , and presumably they have not yet turned up in the other four stars only because the objects have not been observed long or intensively enough . if one or more of the other four objects proves after extensive monitoring _ not _ to be an su uma star , it will present an interesting anomaly .    _",
