    "the most probable reason of the very good coincidence is the existence of the phase island with the good qsaa at @xmath258 , just when the atmosphere is at a standstill ; consequently , ( [ 1.102 ] ) is a good approximation because of @xmath259 .",
    "the values @xmath260  pc , @xmath261 given by @xcite are very close to the present ones . however , some caution is appropriate because of the underestimated uncertainties in their derivation .",
    "their @xmath6 originates from using ( [ 1.102 ] ) , i.e. @xmath106 , the uaa corresponding to line 3 in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "furthermore , because of the uncertain value of @xmath229 , @xmath262 is well possible .    in the bw method",
    ", the propagation of the error @xmath263 can be estimated from ( [ 2.202 ] ) as follows .",
    "typical radius changes of an rr star are @xmath264  km within @xmath265 .",
    "the error of the radius change is @xmath266  km , i.e.  @xmath267 .",
    "by @xmath268 , the final error will be @xmath269 .",
    "this considerably exceeds the error originating from the projection factor ( e.g. @xcite ) converting the observed radial velocity to pulsation velocity .",
    "furthermore , by ( [ 2.202 ] ) and ( [ 1.102 ] ) , the error @xmath269 propagates to an error @xmath270 .    the lower limit of the magnitude averaged visual absolute brightness is @xmath271  mag if @xmath272  pc , while @xmath273  mag belong to the improbable values @xmath274  pc , respectively .",
    "observed colours and magnitudes of a spherically pulsating star have been compared with those of static kurucz model atmospheres to determine fundamental parameters of the star in the frame of the qsaa .",
    "photometric and hydrodynamic conditions have been formulated for the validity qsaa in spherically pulsating stars .    *",
    "the qsaa has been generalized for a non - uniform , compressible atmosphere with radial velocity gradient .",
    "this is a step forward because the hitherto available uaa described the motion of the atmosphere by effective gravity and differentiating the sole parameter radius @xmath18 of optical depth zero with respect to time . *",
    "our combined photometric and hydrodynamic method uses the variation of effective gravity , angular radius , velocity , acceleration in the euler equation .",
    "the complete input of the euler equation has been derived from photometry and theoretical model atmospheres .",
    "spectroscopic and radial velocity observations were used neither explicitly nor implicitly .",
    "this is a definite advantage in comparison with the bw method , because less observational efforts are needed to get the fundamental parameters and the problematic conversion of observed radial velocities to pulsation velocities is not necessary . * concerning the interpretation of multicolour photometry , the inputs are identical with those of the bw method .",
    "the present refinements are the quantitative conditions whether photometry can or can not be interpreted by static model atmospheres .",
    "* first , the phases have been selected by the photometric conditions when the qsaa is valid .",
    "secondly , in a number of these phases , the laws of mass and momentum conservation have been applied in the euler formalism of hydrodynamics to determine the mass and distance of the star from the motion of the atmospheric layers in the neighbourhood of zero optical depth .",
    "afterwards , it was checked whether the hydrodynamic condition of the qsaa was satisfied in the used phases ; i.e. phases that satisfied the photometric condition but violated the hydrodynamic condition had to be excluded .",
    "_ atmospheric dynamical mass _ seems to be an appropriate term to indicate that the mass has been derived by a method which is completely different from a mass derived by pulsation or evolution theories @xcite .",
    "* as a by - product , a variation procedure has been given for estimating atmospheric metallicity and interstellar reddening toward a star from @xmath7 photometry .",
    "this method was successfully applied for the non - variable comparison star bd + 67 708 , giving @xmath8=-0.77\\pm .03 $ ] , @xmath275 , @xmath220  rad , @xmath276 , @xmath222  k. * using the @xmath7 photometry of the high amplitude rrab star su dra , the following fundamental parameters have been found : @xmath277=-1.60\\pm .10,\\ ] ] @xmath278 @xmath279 @xmath280 @xmath281 @xmath282 @xmath283 @xmath216 and @xmath248 are approximate values , since they originate from averaging over the whole pulsation cycle containing phases in which the qsaa is merely a first approximation . * the internal motions of the atmosphere with respect to zero optical depth",
    "have been found to be significant in comparison with velocities and accelerations derived from the uaa . from the internal motions of the atmosphere , some constraints have been sketched for converting observed radial velocities to pulsation and centre of mass velocities .",
