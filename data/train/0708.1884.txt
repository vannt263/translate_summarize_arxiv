    "in this paper we will study a system of one - dimensional ( 1d ) conductors arranged in a square lattice and coupled weakly in the transverse direction .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show that in a rather general situation such quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) electron liquid with purely repulsive electron - electron interaction is either a superconductor , or an insulator with spin or charge density order .",
    "this is demonstrated with the help of a certain variational wave function which adequately captures 1d many - body effects .",
    "the major issue in the description of the q1d metal is the phenomenon of dimensional crossover . at high energy",
    "the system can be viewed as a collection of the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquids .",
    "however the tl liquid can not support a physical electron as an elementary excitation .",
    "thus , at low energy , where transverse single - electron hopping becomes important , it is necessary to abandon the tl notions and use the fermi - liquid approach instead .",
    "therefore , one is to stitch two different descriptions together to obtain complete picture .    from the technical point of view the source of the trouble is the conflict between the many - body tl correlations and transverse single - electron hopping , which is extremely difficult to handle within the framework of the 1d tl liquid @xcite .",
    "a simple method for the crossover description was proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the latter method is based on a variational wave function , whose generalized version we will use in this paper .    to provide an intuitive introduction to the approach of @xcite",
    "we briefly explain the structure of the variational wave function .",
    "consider a 1d conductor described by the tomonaga - luttinger hamiltonian .",
    "the ground state of this system is the ground state of all tl bosons , with every possible momenta @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the cutoff of the theory )",
    ". let s turn the transverse hopping on and couple @xmath5 of these conductors into three - dimensional array .",
    "in this situation the system will attempt to lower its ground state energy even further by taking advantage of the transverse hopping energy .",
    "however , in order to participate in hopping the bosons have to form many - body fermion - like excitations , which have finite overlap with the physical fermion .",
    "to accommodate for the possibility of having two types of excitations , bosonic and fermionic , we device our variational state in the following fashion .",
    "we introduce intermediate cutoff @xmath6 .",
    "all tl bosons , whose energy and momenta are high ( @xmath7 ) , remain in their ground states .",
    "the small momenta bosons ( @xmath8 ) form fermion - like excitations , which are delocalized in transverse direction . to distinguish between the physical electrons and these fermionic excitations",
    "we will refer to the latter as quasiparticles .",
    "in other words , the wave function can be factorized into two parts .",
    "the high - energy part corresponds to the ground state of @xmath7 tomonaga - luttinger bosons , the low - energy part corresponds to the three - dimensional anisotropic fermi liquid composed of the quasiparticles .",
    "the variational energy is minimized by adjusting @xmath9 .",
    "the energy of the quasiparticle transverse hopping is decreasing function of @xmath9 . at the same time , the in - chain energy grows when @xmath10 grows .",
    "the trade - off between the transverse kinetic energy and the in - chain potential energy determines the value of @xmath9 .",
    "if the optimal value of @xmath9 is non - zero , the low - energy excitations of the system are the quasiparticles .",
    "properties of the fermionic quasiparticle state depend on quasiparticle effective hamiltonian .",
    "it arises naturally after high - energy bosons are ` integrated out ' . in this effective hamiltonian",
    "the anisotropy is insignificant . due to this circumstance ,",
    "a standard mean field theory can be used to map out the quasiparticle phase diagram .",
    "since the physical electron and the quasiparticle have finite overlap , there is a direct correspondence between broken symmetry phases of the effective hamiltonian and the physical system .",
    "we already mentioned that the possible phases of the system are spin - density wave ( sdw ) , charge - density wave ( cdw ) , and superconductivity .",
    "the mean - field treatment of the effective hamiltonian was used in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to demonstrate the stability of the superconductivity in q1d metals .",
    "it is remarkable that the superconductivity is stable in the system with no attraction .",
    "superconductivity can not be found if one apply mean - field approximation to the bare hamiltonian . to discover the existence of the superconducting ground state the high - energy degrees of freedom",
    "must be properly accounted for .",
    "our mechanism is related to that of kohn and luttinger .",
    "it is known that classical kohn - luttinger mechanism gives extremely low transition temperature .",
    "our system does not share this property .",
    "due to q1d nature of the system the superconducting coupling constant is not as minuscule as kohn - luttinger coupling constant . consequently , the transition temperature in our model does not have to be unobservable small .",
    "we will see that the phase diagram of our model is similar to the phase diagram of the organic superconductors : _",
    "( i ) _ when the nesting of the fermi surface is good , the ground state is either sdw or cdw ; _ ( ii ) _ under increased pressure the nesting is spoiled , the density wave becomes unstable , and it is replaced by the unconventional superconductivity ; _ ( iii ) _ under even higher pressure the superconducting transition temperature vanishes , and the system shows no sign of the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this similarity suggests that the proposed mechanism may be relevant for these materials .",
    "yet , the purpose of this paper is not to model real - life systems .",
    "indeed , assumptions made about hamiltonian s parameters may be too extreme for a real material .",
    "rather , we want to demonstrate in a controllable way that the superconductivity in q1d metals is a rather generic phenomena .",
    "once this is done , the qualitative understanding developed in a specialized model may be applied to a more complicated situation , where analytical treatment is problematic .",

    "( [ dw_coupling ] ) , which is always satisfied for bare coupling constants , is not necessary fulfilled when the effective constants are compared . therefore , depending on the microscopic details , the density wave phase could be of either nature . to be specific , we will study sdw below .",

    "sdw in q1d metal was thoroughly analyzed at the mean - field level in ref .",
    "we will follow this reference .    as we know , the stability of sdw depends crucially on the nesting of the fermi surface .",
    "shape of the fermi surface is determined by the effective transverse hopping amplitudes @xmath185 .",
    "if one assume that the only non - zero hopping amplitude is the nearest neighbor amplitude @xmath186 , then the resultant fermi surface nests perfectly . in order to describe the fermi surface with non - ideal nesting it is necessary to include at least the next - to - nearest neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath187",

    "this bound will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ accuracy ] in connection with the method s dependability .",
    "the final question is the type of the superconducting order realized in our system .",

    "both have the same coupling constant of @xmath199 .",
    "this degeneracy can not be lifted within our approach for we must include subtler effects into our consideration .",
    "we will argue below ( sect .",
    "[ symmetry_subsection ] ) that the answer is sensitive to microscopic details of the system .",
    "therefore , in real materials either type of the superconductivity can be , in principle , realized .",
    "in this subsection we construct the global phase diagram of the system on the pressure - temperature plane .",
    "the effect of the pressure on our hamiltonian is twofold .",
    "first , it increases the next - to - nearest neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath206 .",
    "thus , the growth of the pressure spoils the nesting of the fermi surface .",
    "second , it makes the system less anisotropic .",
    "this , in turn , leads to the reduction of the 1d renormalization of @xmath172 under increasing pressure .",
    "therefore , one can say that @xmath172 is decreasing functions of pressure .",
    "consequently , at low pressure the nesting is good and the ground state is the density wave phase with the highest transition temperature possible : @xmath207 . under growing pressure",
    "the nesting property of the fermi surface deteriorates and @xmath208 becomes smaller .",
    "the density wave transition temperature decays until some critical pressure @xmath209 at which it quickly goes to zero . at @xmath210",
    "the subleading order , the superconductivity , is stabilized .",
    "the characteristic superconducting critical temperature is smaller than @xmath211 for the density wave coupling constant is higher than that of the superconductivity .",
    "this is so because the density wave order benefits from the in - chain interaction @xmath212 while the superconductivity can not do this .",
    "the superconducting order parameter is either triplet ( @xmath0-wave ) or singlet ( @xmath1-wave ) .",
    "the superconducting gap vanishes at four nodal lines on the fermi surface .    under",
    "even higher pressure @xmath213 for the system becomes less anisotropic and inequality ( [ tilde_g ] ) becomes invalid .",
    "the schematic diagram is shown on fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this section is divided into four subsections . in subsection",
    "a we discuss the accuracy of our method .    in subsection",
    "b we speculate under what condition @xmath214-wave superconductivity may be stabilized .    in subsection c",
    "we compare our approach with other theoretical methods available in the literature .    in subsection",
    "d our theoretical results are compared against published experimental data .    in subsection",
    "e we give our conclusions .",
    "in general , variational approach is an uncontrollable approximation , and one may doubt our conclusions .",
    "fortunately , the presented variational scheme is only a front for the tree - level rg transformation ( see fig .",
    "[ diag ] ) . using rg notions ,",
    "it is possible to prove rigorously that the superconductivity is stable at least in a certain parameter range .",
    "since the stability of the superconducting phase depends on effective inter - chain interactions , we must show that the tree - level rg is enough to capture them adequately .",
    "first , we must establish the structure of the tree - level rg flow . as implied by eq.([hier ] ) , our model is near the tomonaga - luttinger fixed point ( @xmath215 , @xmath126 ) .",
    "the fixed point hamiltonian is perturbed by two relevant operators , @xmath99 and @xmath216 , and one marginal , @xmath89 .",
    "we assume that the transverse hopping is the most relevant operator : at the dimensional crossover ( @xmath217 ) inequality ( [ geff_small ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this tree - level picture disregards several corrections .",
    "the most well - known is @xmath218 contribution to the rg equation for @xmath89 .",
    "this term is of little immediate interest to us since it does not affect the inter - chain interactions .",
    "we identify three terms , which amend the rg equations for inter - chain interaction constants .",
    "first , the backscattering contributes to the anomalous dimension of @xmath219 : the term proportional to @xmath220 enters the rg equation for @xmath219 .",
    "this correction may be neglected since the anomalous dimension is proportional to @xmath221 , which is much larger than @xmath89 [ see ( [ hier ] ) ] .",
    "second , the in - chain interactions combined with the transverse hopping contribute a term of order @xmath222 .",
    "this term corrects inter - chain couplings by the amount : @xmath223 ^ 2       }       {      v_{\\rm f}^3 \\lambda^2(\\ell )       } \\sim \\frac {      ( g_{2,4})^2       }       {      v_{\\rm f }        } , \\\\ t ( \\ell ) = t { \\rm e}^{- \\theta \\ell},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath224 denotes the scaling variable : @xmath225 .",
    "the dimensional crossover occurs , and our our rg stops when @xmath224 reaches the value @xmath226 . at the crossover it is true : @xmath227   =   \\tilde t / [ v_{\\rm f } \\tilde \\lambda ] \\sim 1 $ ] .",
    "third , the inter - chain interactions may contribute to the scaling equations additional terms of order @xmath228 .",
    "such term corrects inter - chain coupling constants by the amount : @xmath229 ^ 2       }       {      v_{\\rm f }        } \\sim \\frac {      ( \\tilde g^\\perp_{2 k_{\\rm f}})^2        }       {      g_{2 }       } , \\\\ g^\\perp_{2 k_{\\rm f } } ( \\ell )   =   g^\\perp_{2 k_{\\rm f } } { \\rm e}^ { - ( 1 - { \\cal k}_c ) \\ell } , \\quad 1 - { \\cal k}_c",
    "\\sim g_2/v_{\\rm f}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the corrections to @xmath199 beyond the tree - level may be disregarded if @xmath230 is much bigger than @xmath231 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to : @xmath232 we already derived inequalities binding @xmath230 [ see eq.([geff_small ] ) and eq.([tilde_g ] ) ] .",
    "since @xmath233 is bigger than @xmath221 , eq.([geff_small ] ) gives less restrictive upper bound on @xmath230 than eq.([tilde_g2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if we want an assurance that our method does not lead us astray , we must abolish eq.([geff_small ] ) and use eq.([tilde_g2 ] ) instead .    the situation with eq.([tilde_g ] )",
    "is somewhat more complicated : it is impossible to know , which quantity , @xmath234 or @xmath235 , is smaller .",
    "we define : @xmath236 and rewrite eq.([tilde_g2 ] ) in the form : @xmath237 this inequality is self - consistent in the sense that @xmath238 [ see eq.([hier ] ) ] .",
    "it is convenient to cast eq .",
    "( [ tilde_g3 ] ) and eq.([small_t ] ) as a constraint on the bare hopping amplitude : @xmath239 if this inequality is satisfied , then the model s phase diagram has a superconducting phase , and the superconductivity is not an artifact of the variational method .",
    "it is likely that some deviations from the constraints imposed by eqs.([hier ] ) and ( [ t < > ] ) are not deadly for superconductivity .",
    "yet , they may affect the order parameter symmetry .",
    "this issue is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we have seen that the symmetry of the order parameter can not be unambiguously determined within the framework of our approximation : as eq.([sc_eff ] ) suggests , both @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave states have similar energies .",
    "our method capture only gross features of the model , it is not delicate enough to calculate the superconducting coupling constant with higher accuracy .",
    "we can identify at least two mechanisms , which could lift the order parameter degeneracy .",
    "they work in opposite direction .",
    "thus , the final outcome depends crucially on the minutiae of the microscopic model .    the mechanism promoting @xmath0-wave increases the coupling constant for this order parameter and decreases the @xmath1-wave coupling constant .",
    "it operates in the following manner .",
    "the rg flow applied to our system generates a new spin - dependent transverse interaction : @xmath240 at the dimensional crossover ( @xmath241 ) one has : @xmath242 .",
    "this estimate can be found in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite [ see first row , second column of table i where @xmath243 .",
    "the new term can be cast as : @xmath244 \\\\ + 2 \\tilde j_{2k_{\\rm f}}^\\perp \\left [      \\tilde \\mathbf{d}_{ij}^a          \\cdot      ( \\tilde \\mathbf{d}_{ij}^a)^{\\dagger }           -3      \\tilde \\delta_{ij}^{s }      ( \\tilde \\delta_{ij}^{s})^\\dagger   \\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the @xmath0-wave coupling constant grows by @xmath245 , and the @xmath1-wave coupling constant decreases by @xmath246 .    a factor in favor of the @xmath1-wave superconductivity is the susceptibility .",
    "one can calculate two susceptibilities , @xmath247 and @xmath248 , for two order parameters : @xmath249 where @xmath250 are the non - universal constants .",
    "in other words , the divergent parts of both susceptibilities are identical , but the non - singular parts depend on the order parameter symmetry and the band structure .",
    "this happens because our two orders have different orbital structure ( @xmath0-wave is symmetric with respect to inversion of the transverse coordinate , while @xmath1-wave is antisymmetric ) .    within the framework of our model ( linear dispersion along the @xmath251-axis , square lattice , small @xmath187 ) we have @xmath252 .",
    "thus , the susceptibility of @xmath253-wave is higher .",
    "the above analysis demonstrates that the symmetry of the order parameter is a non - universal property very sensitive to the microscopic details .",
    "it is reasonable to ask if one can stabilize either of the remaining superconducting orders , @xmath254 or @xmath255 , by modification of the model s hamiltonian .",
    "we can speculate that this might be possible provided that the spin - spin interaction is enhanced .",
    "indeed , by examining eq .",
    "( [ sc_eff ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ sc_couplingss ] ) one concludes that @xmath255 ( @xmath256-wave ) could be non - zero if : @xmath257 such situation may be realized in a system with sufficiently large @xmath89 ( to suppress cdw fluctuations ) and sufficiently small bare values of @xmath258 .    as for @xmath254 , it is always zero : the constants in front of @xmath254 are strictly positive in both eq.([sc_eff ] ) and eq.([sc_couplingss ] ) .",
    "thus , we demonstrate that the q1d metal allows for a broad class of superconducting orders .",
    "the choice between these orders depends on both the band structure and the interaction constants .",
    "the root of the superconductivity in the real - life q1d materials remains an unresolved issue .",
    "it is often suggested that the superconductivity in these compounds is not of phonon but rather of electron origin .",
    "there have been many attempts to construct a mechanism in line with this suggestion .",
    "the theoretical literature on the subject can be split into two groups according to tools used .",
    "the studies employing the random phase approximation ( rpa ) or the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) @xcite constitute the first group .",
    "the second group is made of the papers where rg @xcite is employed .",
    "we have mentioned that our method is closely related to the rg transformation .",
    "clearly , it will be interesting to compare our conclusions with the conclusions of other researchers who use similar strategies .",
    "in ref.@xcite the zero - temperature phase diagram of the q1d metal was mapped with the help of a numerical implementation of the one - loop rg flow .",
    "the authors of the latter papers were found that , if the bare transverse interactions are zero or extremely small , the system undergoes a transition from the sdw phase to the superconducting phase with the order parameter @xmath259 ( @xmath256-wave ) .",
    "furthermore , it was determined that , if the bare constants @xmath260 are sufficiently big , the transition is from the cdw phase into the superconducting phase with the @xmath0-wave order parameter @xmath205 .",
    "the results of these papers can be understood within the framework of our approach . in the limit where the only non - zero inter - chain term is the transverse hopping ( @xmath128 , @xcite ) , the rg flow generates both @xmath230 and @xmath261 .",
    "these constants satisfy the relation eq.([j > g ] ) .",
    "the mechanism behind this is described in the previous subsection .",
    "as we pointed out , when eq.([j > g ] ) is valid , the most stable order parameter is @xmath259 ( @xmath256-wave ) .",
    "thus , our conclusions agrees with findings of ref.@xcite .",
    "the limit studied in @xcite is not compatible with our eq.([hier ] ) . in the latter reference",
    "it was assumed that the in - chain backscattering is of the order of the in - chain forward scattering .",
    "thus , we can not apply our approach straightforwardly , but certain qualitative conclusions may be reached .    when bare @xmath260 is large , the effective coupling @xmath262 is small , and the effective coupling @xmath172 is large .",
    "the ground state of the system with good nesting is cdw .",
    "the destruction of the cdw phase takes place when the nesting becomes sufficiently poor .",
    "once the cdw is gone , we find ourselves in a familiar situation where the stable superconducting order parameter is either @xmath263 ( @xmath0-wave ) or @xmath264 ( @xmath1-wave ) , consistent with @xmath0-wave found in @xcite .    if we lower @xmath260 sufficiently , the stability of sdw state may be restored @xcite .",
    "the in - chain backscattering suppresses @xmath265 and promotes @xmath261 , ultimately leading to inequality ( [ j > g ] ) .",
    "in such a regime the most stable order parameter is @xmath259 ( @xmath256-wave ) , which agrees with @xcite .",
    "the above argumentation lends additional support to the notion that the mechanism proposed in this paper is not an artifact of the variational approximation .",
    "it is also a convenient feature of our method that it is analytical and the results of other approaches can be understood within its framework .",
    "besides rg several authors use rpa or flex to determine the superconducting properties in the anisotropic fermi systems @xcite . these approximations resemble the classical bcs scheme in which the phonons are replaced by boson - like excitations of some other kind . in the quoted papers the excitations mediating the attractive interaction between the electrons are spin - density and charge - density fluctuations .",
    "the frameworks laid out by the rpa and flex schemes are very appealing and intuitive .",
    "they both predict that under certain condition the q1d metal is an unconventional superconductor .",
    "there is , however , a weak point : both methods are unable to account for the peculiarities specific for 1d electron liquid . such weakness artificially narrows the region of the parameter space where the superconductivity is stable .",
    "finally , the author recently developed a canonical transformation approach for 1d electron systems @xcite .",
    "this method may be viewed as a generalization of the one discussed in this paper .",
    "the application of the canonical transformation method to the q1d systems is in progress .",
    "the question remains if the model and the mechanism discussed above are of relevance to the q1d superconductors , such as tmtsf and tmttf @xcite .",
    "of cause , the latter compounds have very complicated crystallographic structure : orthorhombic lattice , possibility of anion ordering , dimerization @xcite .",
    "yet , one can hope that these difficulties are not of paramount importance as far as the superconducting mechanism is concerned .",
    "if this hope is justified should be assessed by the mechanism s ability to reproduce main features of the experimental data , at least qualitatively .",
    "we can look at the presented model with a good degree of optimism for it captures two most salient properties of the superconductivity in tmtsf / tmttf .",
    "the first of these two features is the common boundary shared by the superconducting and the sdw phases on the pressure - temperature phase diagram : the diagram of fig.[fig1 ] is similar to the high - pressure part of the ` universal ' phase diagram of the tmtsf / tmttf compounds @xcite .",
    "the second is the non - trivial orbital structure of the order parameter in the q1d superconductors .",
    "there are numerous pieces of evidence in favor of the order parameter with zeros on the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "( however , there is a thermal transport measurement @xcite which contradicts to this picture . )",
    "the order parameters @xmath205 and @xmath266 are of this kind .",
    "therefore , the predictions of our model is in qualitative agreement with the experiment .",
    "we proposed the superconducting mechanism for the strongly anisotropic electron model without attractive interaction .",
    "we have shown that there is a region in the parameter space where the superconductivity is stable and shares a common boundary with sdw .",
    "the model supports two types of unconventional superconducting order parameter .",
    "our mechanism may be relevant for the organic superconductors .",
