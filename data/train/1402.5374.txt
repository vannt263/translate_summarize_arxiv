    "recently there was a renewed interest in the theoretical studies of the multiparton interactions ( mpi ) in which at least two partons of one of the colliding particles are involved in the proton - nucleus collisions@xcite .",
    "to large extent this is due to the first experimental studies of @xmath5 collisions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that mpi would be easier to observe experimentally in @xmath5 collisions than in @xmath6 collisions since they are parametrically enhanced in the @xmath5 case by a factor @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "general formulae for this cross section were derived in @xcite within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) in the impulse approximation ( that is neglecting deviations of the nuclear parton distribution functions ( pdf ) from the additive sum of the nucleon pdfs ) .",
    "the analysis demonstrated connection of the pqcd treatment with the parton model calculation of @xcite for the large @xmath8 limit and uncorrelated nucleon distribution in the nucleus .",
    "the calculation of @xcite employed the formalism developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the use of the generalized double parton distributions in momentum space introduced in ref .",
    "the calculation was done explicitly in the impulse approximation .",
    "it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , that the impulse approximation is not a complete answer and one must include also the so called interference diagrams , although no explicit estimates of their relative strength was performed . in ref .",
    "@xcite the arguments were presented that interference diagrams become important for small x due to the leading twist ( lt ) nuclear shadowing phenomenon .",
    "the main aim of the paper is to calculate explicitly the interference corrections to the impulse approximation due to the nuclear shadowing for the case of proton - deuteron scattering based on the theory of the leading twist shadowing phenomena ( for a recent review see @xcite ) which successfully predicted gluon shadowing for the coherent photoproduction of @xmath9 recently observed at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the limit when one of partons in the deuteron has small enough @xmath10 , so that nuclear shadowing is present for the deuteron pdf while the second parton is probed in the kinematics where shadowing effects are absent .",
    "we will demonstrate that in this limit nuclear shadowing induced interference is present already on the level of diagrams where one of the nucleons is active in the amplitude and two in the conjugated amplitude ( or vise versa ) , and that it has the same magnitude as the enhancement of mpi due to the interaction with two nucleons in the impulse approximation . in our analysis",
    "we will neglect a small effect of antishadowing in the deuteron pdfs at @xmath11 which is present due to the momentum sum rule , see discussion in @xcite .",
    "we also consider the interference for the case when just one parton of proton is interchanged with one parton of neutron and argue that this interference effect is much smaller than the leading twist shadowing interference .",
    "while the actual experiments are done with the heavy nuclei , we believe that the deuteron case provides a simple `` laboratory '' for the studying possible mechanisms of shadowing in four jet production processes . in the case of heavy nuclei combinatorics of the shadowing diagrams",
    "is much more complicated .",
    "it will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the shadowing in the multijet production differs significantly from the lt shadowing for nuclear pdfs since the two partons belonging to the projectile proton are typically located in a very small transverse area of the radius @xmath12 . as a result",
    "they scatter off two different but very close in the impact parameter space nucleons that may be rather strongly correlated .",
    "this is especially true for the case of scattering off the deuteron which is a highly correlated system .",
    "hence the analysis presented here can serve as the stepping stone to a discussion of similar effects for mpi with heavy nuclei .    in the current experimental studies one usually starts with a trigger on a hard process of large virtuality - say dijet with @xmath13 s larger than 50 @xmath14 100 gev and one",
    "next looks for a second hard subprocess in the underlying event .",
    "since the lt nuclear shadowing for @xmath15 100 gev / c is very small we will focus here on consideration of the mpi in which one of the subprocesses has large enough x or large virtuality so that the leading twist nuclear shadowing can be neglected in this case .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in section 2",
    "we apply the general expressions relating double hard four jet cross section for the collision of hadrons @xmath8 and @xmath16 in terms of @xmath17gpds ( eq .  [ 1 ] ) to obtain a compact expression for the double parton antishadowing contribution ( dpa ) taking into account the finite transverse size of the gluon gpd in the nucleon . in section 3",
    "we summarize first the theory of the lt shadowing for the deuteron pdfs and next use it to calculate the shadowing correction to the mpi rate for the case when x of one of the partons of the deuteron participating in collision is large and another is small .",
    "we demonstrate that the shadowing in the case of mpi is a factor of two stronger than in the case of the deuteron pdfs . at the same time",
    "an additional contribution to mpi due to the pqcd evolution induced correlations in the proton wave function reduces this enhancement . in section 4",
    "we present the numerical results .",
    "we find that shadowing effect is smaller but of the same magnitude as dpa for modest virtualities ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we show explicitly that the double parton shadowing is negligible when both of the partons have large @xmath10 , confirming the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . in section 5",
    "we estimate the contribution of the interference diagrams corresponding to the situation when a parton `` 1 '' ( `` 2 '' ) in the amplitude belongs to the proton ( neutron ) and in the conjugated amplitude to the neutron ( proton ) . we argue that these contributions are small",
    "compared to shadowing mechanisms .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 6 . in the appendix we consider correspondence of the glauber series for the inelastic @xmath5 scattering and combinatorics of mpi .",

    "it is easy to see that the shadowing originates from configurations where two nucleons are roughly behind each other . for these configurations shadowing",

    "it is worth emphasizing that the expressions for shadowing contribution to the the deuteron pdfs can be derived both using pretty cumbersome approach of the original paper of gribov @xcite or using abramovski , gribov kancheli ( agk ) cutting rules @xcite in combination with the the qcd factorization theorems for diffraction scattering and for inclusive scattering @xcite .",

    "for such two nucleon configuration lt nuclear shadowing is large since the effective cross section of the rescattering interaction is large .",

    "as usual only the diagrams with elastic @xmath74 vertex contribute , since we work in conventional two nucleon approximation for the deuteron when all other components of the deuteron wave function are neglected .",

    "it is straightforward to see that the integration over the momenta of nucleons in the initial and final states leads to the factor @xmath140 , where @xmath93 is the deuteron body form factor defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : rho_d ] , and @xmath141 is the 3d momentum transfer to the nucleon of the deuteron calculated in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "hence in the limit we consider when one @xmath10 is small and second is far away from the shadowing region there exists a range of @xmath0 x_1 ~0.1 , where interference is very strongly suppressed by the deuteron form factor independent of the details of the dynamics .",
    "let us now discuss the interference contribution for smaller @xmath0 and compare it to the dpa contribution .",
    "first , there are generic small factors which are related the dominance of the two nucleon configurations in the deuteron wave function ( accuracy of this approximation is discussed below ) .",
    "consider now the dynamical overlap in the final state .",
    "let us now demonstrate that the overlap integral calculated neglecting color and spin effects is similar to the case of double nucleon interaction .",
    "we consider for simplicity the case when @xmath0 is small and the effect of suppression due to the longitudinal momentum transfer can be neglected .",

    "choosing a more realistic scale @xmath153 will lead to a significant reduction of @xmath151 .",
    "the @xmath154 evolution to the scale @xmath155 leads to an additional suppression which will be discussed below .",
    "hence account of the spacial overlap leads to suppression of interference , so it will be at most of the order of dpa contribution .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that for the contributions involving the parton interchange are suppressed in generic hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the reason is that , if there is a parton interchange in the projectile / target or both , the large logarithm is lost , which is due to the integration over transverse momenta . as a result such diagrams are not double collinear enhanced and do not contribute in the lla ( the authors of @xcite call this type of diagrams the ladder cross talk ) .",
    "the physical reason is that in order to get a large logarithm from the integration over transverse momenta in the ladder the partons in the initial and final states must be at the same impact parameter .",
    "while this occurs automatically for diagonal pairing , this generally does not happen for pairing of arbitrary partons .",
    "there is an additional small factor due to the longitudinal color delocalization in such exchange as the color interchange creates a color dipole of length comparable to the nucleon size and hence carrying a significant excitation energy @xcite .    the only way to avoid loosing transverse",

    "the interference for the @xmath54 processes was studied recently by gaunt @xcite , in this case two partons which interact with the deuteron are created in the split of a single parton of the projectile nucleon .",
    "they are located at the same impact parameter . hence such interference diagrams contributing in the lla ( double collinearly enhanced ) .",
    "however the contribution of this mechanism may become sizable only at very small x , near the black disk regime limit .",
    "indeed , the contribution of @xmath54 mechanism to the dpa is is small in the discussed x - range .",

    "the interference is negligible relative to the full @xmath54 contribution@xcite .",
    "hence the overall upper limit on the interference based on these considerations is much smaller than the shadowing effect which we calculated above .    at the same time it follows from analysis in @xcite that significant contribution of interference to @xmath54 can appear potentially , even for symmetric kinematics for very small @xmath10 , since they are effectively defined by values of @xmath10 where the split occurs .",
    "only then it can become comparable to shadowing .",
    "this case needs further study , in particular a more detailed analysis of the ladder cross talk effect @xcite is desirable .",
    "we explained above that the interference contributions are small in the lla .",
    "here we shall show that there are additional suppression mechanisms that will reduce interference further , even beyond the lla .",
    "let us now show that the interchange of two partons between neutron and proton in the deuteron , in the case when no exchange occurs in the projectile proton , leads to the color suppression by a factor @xmath158 , where @xmath158 is the dimension of su(3 ) irreducible representation to which the parton belongs .",
    "such a suppression is a reflection of the well known property of the suppression of nonplanar diagrams as compared to planar ones . for simplicity we shall consider the interaction of two partons of the deuteron with two partons of the projectile due to single gluon exchanges in t - channel",
    "indeed , consider for example the case of two baryons , @xmath159 .",
    "their wave functions in the color space are @xmath160 for the first nucleon and @xmath161 for the second one .",
    "consider the color factor from the projectile nucleon .",
    "for simplicity assume that two dijets originate from quark quark scattering .",
    "the color factor that we obtain from contracting the same quark in the amplitude and the conjugated amplitude is @xmath162 , where we sum over final jet indices .",
    "the color factor from the projectile nucleon gives @xmath163 .",

[ tup1 ]    the corresponding factor in the conjugated amplitude in the diagonal case is t^a_siq_2jq_3k ... ^ijk ... t^b_s_1pq_(n_c+2)qq_(n_c+3)r ... ^pqr ..... [ tup2 ] taking the product we obtain ( t^at^a)(t^bt^b)=^aa^bb.

    "quarks `` 1 '' and `` @xmath164 '' are interchanged between two nucleons in the conjugated amplitude , while having the same initial state ( here for simplicity we consider two nucleons consisting of @xmath165 quarks with @xmath165 flavors ) .",
    "hence the nucleon wave functions in the conjugated amplitude are @xmath166 for the first nucleon and @xmath167 for the second one .",
    "then the color factor originating from the deuteron block is t^a_siq_(n_c+2)jq_(n_c+3)k^ijk ... t^b_s_1pq_2qq_3r .... ^pqr ..... calculating the product we obtain ( t^at^b)_ss_1 ( t^bt^a)_s_1 s . taking the trace over indices of the final jets we obtain ( t^at^bt^bt^a ) . combining with the color factor coming from the proton block we obtain ( t^at^bt^bt^a)=c_f^2n_c=(n^2_c-1)^2 , which is @xmath168 smaller than in the diagonal case .",
    "the same calculation can be done for two dijets originating from the scattering off two gluons . for simplicity",
    "let us take the gluon part of the first nucleon wave function as a color singlet @xmath169 , where gluon @xmath170 participates in the scattering process and the second one is a spectator , while the second nucleon has wave function @xmath171.repeating the same calculation as for the quark case , we find that the factor originating from the projectile nucleon is @xmath172 .",
    "for the deuteron contribution for the diagonal case we get @xmath173 , where the matrices @xmath174 are generators in the adjoint representation . combining the factors coming from the projectile nucleon and the target deuteron we obtain for diagonal case n^4_c(n^2_c-1)^2 . in the same way for the interference contribution we obtain @xmath175 , and after combining with the upper block of the diagram we get c_v^2n_c^2(n_c^2 - 1)=n^4_c(n_c^2 - 1 ) , which corresponds to the @xmath176 suppression . from these two examples",
    "it is clear that if we interchange the partons in the conjugated amplitude , the interchanged parton being in irreducible representation of @xmath177 with dimension @xmath158 , we obtain the @xmath178 suppression .",
    "the similar arguments for spin variables for the chiral states give suppression @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is a number of spin states .",
    "so altogether we obtain a factor of 1/6 suppression for quark , and a factor of 1/16 suppression for gluon interference .",
    "consider now double interference , in this case using the same arguments we see that if we interchange the partons both in the nuclear part ( between two nucleons ) and in the upper part of the diagram , we get the product of two traces , i.e. for quark case we obtain ( t^at^bt^bt^a)(t^at^bt^bt^a)~(t^at^bt^bt^at^bt^b ) .",
    "where the last equality is in the large @xmath165 limit .",
    "it is easy to see that in this limit the trace is @xmath181 , and thus the double interchange increases the color suppression to @xmath182 , in the notations of the previous subsection .",
    "note finally that such color suppressions were included in the estimate of the interference in lla discussed in subsection b.      finally , we assumed above that the deuteron in both initial and conjugated amplitudes consists of two nucleons .",
    "since the deuteron block for @xmath183 corresponds to the intermediate state for the deuteron wave function which is not a two - nucleon state we can use the information about the deuteron structure to estimate the probability of the non - nucleonic ( exotic ) component of the deuteron wave function , @xmath184 as well .",
    "the exotic components are expected to have a small probability since the @xmath185 configurations are suppressed by the chiral nature of the pion @xcite , while the lowest mass two baryon intermediate state is @xmath186 , which has a mass gap of @xmath187 with the ground state . as a result one expects that the probability of the non - nucleonic component in the deuteron is @xmath188@xcite .",
    "the experimental limit on the probability of the non - nucleonic components in the short - range correlations ( src ) in nuclei coming from the jlab and bnl experiments is @xmath189 , for a review see @xcite .",
    "since the structure of src in the deuteron and heavier nuclei is found to be very similar and the probability of src in the deuteron is @xmath190 the current data lead to the upper limit for the exotic admixture @xmath191 .",
    "note here that a likely candidate for the dominant exotic component for the deuteron wave function , the lightest baryon intermediate state ",
    "@xmath186 can not be generated via interchange of two gluons .",
    "complementary way to look at the problem is to consider the singularities in the t - channel for the parton interchange - in the case of the two gluon interchange the closest singularity is presumably a gluonium state which has a mass @xmath192 1.5 gev and hence corresponds to exceedingly small inter nucleon distances which occur in the deuteron with probability on the scale of @xmath193 .",
    "note also that this argument does not include a small factor due to the requirement the both nucleons after interchange of partons remain nucleons rather than some excited states since typically the color is delocalized in such exchanges at the distance scale of the order on the nucleon size .",
    "overall we see that the interference mechanism contribution is negligible in the leading twist lla approximation , unless we consider kinematics region close to the black disk regime , where the interference effects may be significant , but this region is clearly beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in addition , we have seen that there are additional suppression mechanisms , like color / spin suppression , overlap of momentum flows ( subsection a ) that likely diminish the interference mechanism in an independent way .",
    "more studies are necessary for @xmath194 range for near the black disk limit .",
    "going beyond the lla is also highly desirable both for @xmath6 and @xmath5 scattering .",
    "the case of large a will be considered elsewhere .",
    "we calculated the contributions of dpa and the nucleon shadowing to the four jet mpi cross section in the proton - deuteron collisions in the limit when one of the probes has small @xmath10 and another has @xmath195 in the range where shadowing is small .",
    "we have demonstrated that shadowing increases with the decrease of @xmath10 , and decreases rapidly with the increase of hard scale . for large @xmath13 of one of the probes corresponding to a typical jet trigger in @xmath5 collisions at the lhc and small @xmath13 of the other probe we obtain correction of the order of @xmath196 .",
    "this contribution is not reduced to the substitution of the deuteron pdf instead of nucleon pdf in the impulse approximation formula ",
    "it is twice as large as a such naive guess .",
    "there is a reduction by the factor @xmath197 that may be of order 1/2 , depending on kinematics , due to a completely different mechanism of @xmath54 enhancement of the four jet cross section .",
    "we also provided arguments for the dominance of the leading twist shadowing one nucleon - two nucleon interference mechanism over the contribution due to the interchange of partons between two nucleons in the kinematics discussed ( @xmath198 few gev@xmath58 ) .",
    "in particular we demonstrated that in the lla used in our analysis the interference diagrams are strongly suppressed .",
    "further studies of interference beyond lla and in different kinematic domains are desirable .",
    "this is especially true in the region of small @xmath154 and @xmath10 , in proximity to the black disk regime .",
    "our analysis will serve as a starting point to a more complicated calculation of shadowing in the case of heavy nuclei for the similar kinematics .",
    "further studies will be necessary for calculations of the shadowing in the kinematics when both @xmath199 of the partons from the nucleus are small and hence more complicated diagrams contribute to the the nuclear shadowing .",
    "we thank cern theory division for hospitality during the time this work has started , and yu .",
    "dokshitzer , l.  frankfurt , d.  treleani and u.  wiedemann for useful discussions .",
    "it is easy to see that the structure of the double scattering term is very close to that for the double scattering term for the total cross section of @xmath5 scattering in the glauber model .",
    "this similarity holds for any nuclear wave functions as the two - body form factor which enters in both cases is the same .",
    "since the relevant expressions for the heavy nucleus case were derived before in @xcite it is convenient to check the correspondence taking the limit of large a , and neglecting nucleon - nucleon correlations .    the ratio of the double and single scattering terms in the glauber series for the total cross section of @xmath200 scattering : @xmath201 this expression differs from the ratio of the cross section of production of four jets in the interaction with two and one nucleons ( eqs .",

    "it is straightforward to find the expressions for the double interaction contribution if the expression for the shadowing for the total cross section is known ( including the effects of nucleon - nucleon correlations )    for example , in the case of the scattering off the deuteron contribution of the diagram 2 to @xmath204 is given by ( for the discussion of proton - deuteron four jet production in the coordinate space representation see @xcite . )",
