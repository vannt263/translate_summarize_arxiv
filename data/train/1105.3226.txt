    "the first measurement of elliptic flow in pb+pb collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has just been reported @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath3 characterizes the momentum anisotropy of final particle emission in non - central heavy - ion collisions relative to the event - plane , defined by the beam direction and the minor axis of the nuclear overlap region in the collision .",
    "it describes the efficiency of the medium generated in the collision to generate from an initial spatial deformation of its density distribution an asymmetry in the final momentum distribution , through interactions of the medium constituents .",
    "this efficiency increases with the coupling strength between those constituents and becomes maximal for an infinitely strongly coupled medium . in this limit the mean free path of the constituents becomes as small as allowed by the uncertainty relation @xcite , and the medium reaches very quickly a state of approximate local thermal equilibrium which allows to describe its evolution with fluid dynamics . for given initial spatial deformation of the collision fireball , ideal fluid dynamics ( which assumes zero mean free path ) is expected to generate the largest possible elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "shear viscosity , a consequence of non - zero mean free paths and limited from below by quantum mechanics @xcite , will lead to a suppression of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "compelling evidence for fluid dynamical behavior of the collision fireballs created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions , with a very small ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density , @xmath2 , has been found in heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "the new data from the lhc confirm this picture @xcite and agree , at least qualitatively , with hydrodynamic predictions of elliptic flow for pb+pb collisions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to explore how good this agreement is quantitatively , and to what extent the present and future lhc elliptic flow data can tell us novel facts about the transport behavior of hot qcd matter at temperatures that exceed those accessible at rhic but are within reach at the lhc .",
    "similar to the analyses in @xcite , but different from recent hybrid model studies in @xcite , we base our analysis on a purely hydrodynamic approach .",
    "while this ignores the fact that the late dilute hadronic stage of the expansion is very dissipative and not well described by fluid dynamics ( neither ideal @xcite nor viscous @xcite ) , the importance of the hadronic phase for the development of elliptic flow is expected to be much reduced at the lhc relative to rhic @xcite . as in refs .",

    "our fitted value @xmath4 ( for cgc initial conditions , see below ) is 25% larger than that used by luzum and romatschke @xcite but agrees well with the value for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) viscosity @xmath5 recently extracted from rhic data by using a hybrid viscous hydrodynamic + boltzmann approach ( vishnu  @xcite ) .",

    "the ability of the mc - kln model to describe the centrality dependence of charged hadron production without additional parameters is the main reason for choosing it over the mc - glauber model as our basis for extrapolation from rhic to lhc energies .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that this centrality dependence is robust against running coupling corrections @xcite in the balitsky - kovchegov evolution ( on which the kln model is based ) which were found to hardly affect its shape .",
    "they do , however , modify the collision energy dependence of particle production , with the lhc pb+pb data being better described if running coupling corrections are included @xcite .",
    "our version of the mc - kln model does not include running coupling corrections , and we must normalize the initial entropy density profile for pb+pb collisions at the lhc separately from au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "without such an independent renormalization , we overpredict the measured charged multiplicity from central @xmath25tev pb+pb collisions @xcite by about 10% .",

    "since the entropy production rate is given by @xmath82 this effect is stronger for navier - stokes initial conditions ( where @xmath78 is proportional to the velocity shear tensor @xmath83 which at early times diverges like @xmath84 ) than for zero initial shear stress ( where @xmath78 starts from zero and approaches its navier - stokes value @xmath85 only after several relaxation times @xmath86 when , due to its @xmath84 decay , it has already decreased to much smaller values ) . that are generated by viscous heating during the hydrodynamic expansion : constant @xmath30 : @xmath87 ( @xmath24 ) and 33% ( @xmath44 ) ;",

    "[ f12 ] would exclude a temperature dependence of @xmath2 as given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) for naver - stokes initial conditions . while we are not prepared to make such a statement on the basis of fig .",
    "[ f12 ] alone , we believe that it is important to point out this relatively strong sensitivity of the centrality dependence of @xmath23 to the transport properties of the expanding fireball medium and to emphasize the constraints it thus places on possible models for the qgp shear viscosity .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the influence of a possible temperature dependence of @xmath2 on the charged hadron @xmath11-spectra and elliptic flow .",
    "figure  [ f13 ] shows lhc predictions for @xmath25tev pb+pb collisions of @xmath92 centrality . to ensure comparability of the different cases studied in this figure we simply normalized the initial entropy density profile such that we always obtain @xmath93 , i.e. the same value that we had obtained before for constant @xmath30 at this centrality .",
    "we first note that for constant @xmath30 , we do nt observe any significant difference in the charged hadron spectra and elliptic flow between zero and navier - stokes initialization for @xmath78 .",
    "turning to the temperature - dependent parametrizations @xmath94 , we note that for zero initialization of @xmath78 ( solid lines ) our results agree with those reported in @xcite : an increase of @xmath2 at higher qgp temperatures leads to somewhat harder charged hadron @xmath11-spectra ( i.e. somewhat stronger radial flow , caused by the larger tranverse effective pressure gradients at early times ) and a suppression of the differential elliptic flow ( due to an increase of the time - averaged effective shear viscosity of the fluid ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe the hierarchy of the curves in fig .",
    "[ f13 ] corresponding to the three parametrizations ( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) : for the @xmath11-spectra , all three @xmath95-dependent viscosities lead to almost identical hardening effects on the spectral slope , while for the differential elliptic flow @xmath50 the curves are ordered not according to the @xmath2-values at the initial central fireball temperature ( see table  [ t1 ] ) , but according to their hierarchy in the @xmath96mev range . in fact",
    ", the observed magnitudes of the viscous @xmath3 suppression for the three @xmath97 functions suggest that , at this beam energy and collision centrality , the buildup of elliptic flow is dominated by the qgp transport properties at @xmath98mev .",
    "( at rhic energies , the transport properties for @xmath99mev dominate the generation of @xmath3 @xcite . )    cccc @xmath2 model & @xmath100 & @xmath101(@xmath102 ) & @xmath103(mev ) + @xmath30 &    .initial central entropy densities @xmath101 and temperatures @xmath103 for the viscous hydrodynamic simulations of @xmath92 centrality pb+pb collisions at the lhc ( @xmath48tev ) shown in fig .",
    "the different models for the @xmath95-dependence of @xmath2 are defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) .",
    "`` 0 '' stands for @xmath104 at @xmath12 , `` ns '' stands for navier - stokes initialization of the shear stress tensor , @xmath105 at @xmath12 .",
    "[ t1 ] [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      +    for navier - stokes initial conditions ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ f13 ] ) , the increase in radial flow caused by an increase of @xmath2 at high temperature is stronger and the viscous @xmath3 suppression is weaker than for zero initial @xmath78 .",
    "this is caused by the much larger initial shear stress tensor components in the ns case , compared to the case of @xmath104 where @xmath78 approaches its ( by that time already much smaller ) navier - stokes limit only after several relaxation times @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath2 with temperature generates a steeper initial transverse effective pressure gradient ( since @xmath78 grows faster than the entropy density @xmath106 when @xmath2 increases with temperature ) , and this generates stronger radial flow .",
    "it also causes a larger spatial eccentricity of the initial effective pressure profile which ( when compared to the case of @xmath104 ) generates stronger elliptic flow .",
    "in fact , we found that for earlier starting times @xmath12 ( where the navier - stokes values for @xmath78 are even larger ) , the quadratic parametrization @xmath107 with ns initial conditions can lead to _ more _ elliptic flow than a constant @xmath30 , in spite of the larger mean viscosity of the fluid .",
    "we conclude from this exercise that a firm determination whether or not the alice data point towards a temperature - dependent growth of @xmath2 with increasing @xmath95 , as expected from perturbative qcd @xcite and ( perhaps ) from lattice qcd @xcite , is not possible without a better understanding of the initial conditions for the energy momentum tensor ( in particular the shear stress components ) at the beginning of the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "whereas generically larger viscosities cause a suppression of the elliptic flow , temperature - dependent viscosities can influence the initial effective pressure profile and its eccentricity in a way that counteracts this tendency and , for some models such as navier - stokes initial conditions , can even overcompensate it .",
    "based on an successful global fit of soft hadron production data in @xmath7gev au+au collisions at rhic with a pure viscous hydrodynamic model with cooper - frye freeze - out , presented in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we generated hydrodynamic predictions for the @xmath11-spectra and differential elliptic flow of unidentified charged hadrons and identified pions and protons for pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "where available , these predictions were compared with available experimental data from the alice collaboration . our extrapolation from rhic to lhc energies",
    "was based on the assumption that the qgp shear viscosity @xmath2 does not change with increasing fireball temperature and stays fixed at the value @xmath30 extracted from the rhic data , assuming mc - kln initial conditions .",
    "the start time @xmath12 for the hydrodynamic evolution and the freeze - out temperature @xmath18 were held fixed , too .",
    "we found that , using the beam energy scaling implicit in the mc - kln model , such an extrapolation gives a good description of the centrality dependence of charged hadron production and the charged hadron @xmath11-spectra in central pb - pb collisions , but overpredicts the slope of the @xmath11-differential elliptic flow and the value of its @xmath11-integrated value by about @xmath49 in mid - central to mid - peripheral collisions . in the most peripheral collisions ,",
    "the predicted charged hadron @xmath11-spectra are too flat , and the integrated elliptic flow is too small compared to the experimental data .",
    "a preliminary study of possible temperature dependent variations of @xmath2 in the high - temperature region explored for the first time at the lhc remained unconclusive but pointed to a clear need for better theoretical control over the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic energy - momentum tensor , in particular its shear stress components . the development of detailed dynamical models for the pre - thermal evolution of the collision fireball and their matching to the viscous hydrodynamic stage is a matter of priority for continued progress towards quantifying the transport properties of the quark - gluon plasma at different temperatures and densities .",
