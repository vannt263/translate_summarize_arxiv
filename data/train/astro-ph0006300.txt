    "in the last few years , a new reference model of structure formation has emerged , one in which 70% or so of the total matter content of the universe is in a form of dark energy .",
    "the main evidence for such a component is the supernovae ia observations of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , which can be explained by assuming an accelerated expansion due either to a cosmological constant or to a new matter component with equation of state @xmath3 with @xmath4 @xcite@xcite .",
    "this new component can also be modeled as a light scalar field with a potential that allows for a potential - dominated epoch @xcite @xcite as , e.g. , an exponential potential or an inverse power law .",
    "the evidence for the new component , sometimes denoted dark energy or  quintessence ",
    "@xcite , has been reinforced by the recent boomerang cmb observations that show a preference for a flat universe @xcite@xcite .",
    "in fact , since a cdm density of @xmath5 is in agreement with a host of independent observations , from cluster abundance to cluster x - ray temperature , lensing , velocity fields etc . , we can conclude that a conspicuous fraction of the total energy density has to be unclustered ( or weakly clustered ) and with negative pressure @xcite , although the direct constraint on the amount of dark energy from cmb alone is weak    the nature of this extra component is so far completely unknown .",
    "the simplest explanation , the cosmological constant , runs against the argument that , from a dimensional point of view , its value should be more than a hundred orders of magnitude smaller than expected , and tuned with astonishing precision in order to become dominant just today .",
    "the hypothesis of some fundamental scalar field has at least the advantage that one may hope to build a theory that explains the coincidence as a consequence of some fundamental principle .",
    "for instance , the inclusion of a coupling between dark matter and dark energy , as will be done in this paper , might explain why the two energy densities are comparable .",
    "another motivation for considering a scalar field lies in the fact that it is premature to be too specific about the dark energy properties : a general scalar field includes as a limiting case the cosmological constant , but allows also to investigate less extreme effective equations of state .    in the same spirit of generality ,",
    "i investigate the effect of an additional degree of freedom , represented by the coupling of the scalar field to ordinary matter .",
    "such a coupling has been proposed and investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , and is equivalent , up to a conformal rescaling , to the classical brans - dicke coupling to gravity ( for gravity coupling in the context of quintessence see refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) . if the dark energy is coupled to dark matter alone ( and not to baryons ) , the present constraints on the coupling are rather weak @xcite@xcite@xcite ; as a consequence , in @xcite it was shown that the effects on the cmb turn out to be at the level of detectability already with the present data set .",
    "aim of this paper is to use the most recent cmb data , the boomerang power spectrum @xcite , along with the cobe data ( as reduced in @xcite ) , to further constrain the coupled dark energy model .",
    "as particular cases , we will derive constraints on the pure cosmological constant model and on the uncoupled dark energy .",
    "a comparison of boomerang with a different model of uncoupled dark energy is in @xcite .",
    "in all the calculations of this paper a flat universe is assumed .",
    "this is of course a severe limitation , but the number of free parameters is already large enough to be at the limits of computational capabilities .",
    "moreover , the hypothesis of quintessence has always been formulated in the context of flat models , in order to be consistent with the inflationary expectations .",
    "while the work was almost completed the results of the maxima experiment @xcite@xcite@xcite have been published .",
    "they seem to confirm the results of boomerang , but have not been included in the present paper .",
    "the model of coupled quintessence or dark energy has already been studied in detail in @xcite . here",
    "i limit myself to a summary of its properties .",
    "consider three components , a scalar field @xmath6 , baryons and cdm , described by the energy - momentum tensors @xmath7 @xmath8and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "general covariance requires the conservation of their sum , so that it is possible to consider a coupling such that @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the coupling constants .",
    "this particular coupling is indeed obtained by conformally transforming a non - minimally coupled gravity theory or , following @xcite , by the lagrangian ( in units @xmath12 ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 and where @xmath15 denote the lagrangian of the dark matter and baryonic fields .",
    "notice that our constant @xmath16 corresponds to the invisible coupling constant @xmath17 of @xcite .",
    "the radiation field ( subscript @xmath18 ) remains uncoupled , since @xmath19 we derive the background equations in the flat conformal frw metric @xmath20 assuming the exponential potential @xmath21 as proposed e.g. in @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "as anticipated , we will couple the dark energy scalar field to the dark matter only , putting @xmath22 .",
    "we call this choice dark - dark coupling",
    ". generalizing @xcite we introduce the following variables ( putting @xmath23 ) @xmath24 adopting the @xmath25-folding time @xmath26 we can write the field , baryon and radiation conservation equation as a system in the four variables @xmath27 that depends on the parameters @xmath28 @xmath29 where the prime denotes derivation with respect to @xmath30 , and where @xmath31 the  coupling constant @xmath0 can therefore be regarded as the ratio of the dark energy coupling strength to the gravitational strength .",
    "the dark - dark coupling @xmath0 is unconstrained by local experiments or by @xmath32 measurements @xcite .",
    "constraints can be derived only by global effects on the cosmological dynamics : for instance , from the requirement of a universe older than 10 gyr ref .",
    "@xcite found @xmath33 in the following we show that boomerang puts a much more stringent constraint on the dark - dark coupling .    neglecting the baryons",
    ", the system has a transient attractor ( properly speaking , a saddle point ) at the point @xmath34 on which the scale factor expands as @xmath35 ( here @xmath36 is the ordinary time defined as @xmath37 ) , that is , slower than in a ordinary mde . during this stage ,",
    "first found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and denoted @xmath6mde in @xcite , the scalar field kinetic energy and the dark matter have a constant density ratio . when the universe leaves the saddle , it reaches a global attractor if @xmath38 , at the point @xmath39 and the universe expansion follows the law @xmath40 mimicking a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .",
    "the expansion is accelerated only if @xmath43 .",
    "as long as the baryon component is small with respect to the cdm , the phase space of the system remains qualitatively the same .",
    "it can be noticed that the @xmath6mde depends only on @xmath44 , while the subsequent @xmath45-dominated epoch depends only on @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , as shown in @xcite , the possibility to set constraints on the coupling @xmath44 depends on the existence of the @xmath6mde .",
    "this epoch is actually quite more general than appears from the discussion above : it exists infact for any potential such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 go asymptotically to zero , as for instance when @xmath49 is an inverse power law .",
    "the coupled quintessence with exponential potential contains the case of pure cosmological constant ( @xmath50 ) , of uncoupled quintessence ( @xmath51 ) and is asymptotically equivalent to a perfect fluid with a constant equation of state @xmath42 .",
    "the model is conformally equivalent to a non - minimal gravity theory with lagrangian term @xmath52 and potential @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "therefore , a bound on @xmath0 amounts to constraining the non - minimal gravity coupling @xmath1 .",
    "notice that in the case we study here , in which the dark energy couples differently to baryons and to dark matter , there are two conformally related metrics in the jordan frame ( the frame in which gravity is coupled to the scalar field ) : the constant @xmath1 couples the scalar field to the ricci scalar expressed in the metric in which the dark matter , rather than the baryons , follow the geodetics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the perturbation equations , derived in @xcite , are integrated by the use of a purposedly modified cmbfast code @xcite .",
    "in addition to the scalar field , baryons , cdm and radiation , the code includes also massless neutrinos .",
    "i choose adiabatic initial conditions , as suggested by inflation .",
    "the initial conditions for the background equations are found for each set of parameters by trial and error so as to give today @xmath56 and @xmath57 as requested .",
    "this procedure is so time consuming with respect to the code without coupled scalar field that the assumption of flat space and a further reduction in the parameter space explained below turned out to be necessary .",
    "our theoretical model depends on two scalar field parameters and four cosmological parameters : @xmath58 the remaining input parameters requested by the cmbfast code are set as follows : @xmath59 @xmath60 the latter quantity specifies the optical depth to thomson scattering , and is a measure of reionization . in the analysis of @xcite this parameter was also included in the general likelihood and , in the flat case , was found to be compatible with zero at slightly more than 1@xmath61 . moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is found that fixing @xmath62 has only a minor effect on the other parameters . therefore here , to further reduce the parameter space ,",
    "i assume @xmath63 to vanish .",
    "two other approximations with respect to @xcite have been necessary : first , i did not include the cross - correlation between bandpowers because it is not available .",
    "second , an offset log - normal approximation to the band - power likelihood has been advocated by @xcite and adopted by @xcite , but the @xmath64-quantity necessary for its evaluation is not available .",
    "since the offset log - normal reduces to a log - normal in the limit of small noise i evaluated the log - normal likelihood @xmath65 ^{2}}{\\sigma _ { \\ell } ^{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , the subscripts @xmath36 and @xmath67 refer to the theoretical quantity and to the real data , @xmath68 are the spectra binned over some interval of multipoles centered on @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the experimental errors on @xmath71 , and the parameters are denoted collectively as @xmath72 .",
    "a 10% calibration error is added to the experimental errors @xcite .",
    "i also evaluated for comparison a likelihood gaussian in the variables @xmath73 , and found that the results do not change appreciably up to 2@xmath74 from the peak .    among the parameters that refer to the scalar field , we have already shown in @xcite that @xmath75 has a negligible effect on the background solution at @xmath76 , since the equivalence time does not depend on it and ,",
    "although @xmath75 sets the speed of the present accelerated expansion , this has only a minor effect on the perturbation spectrum at decoupling .",
    "this will be confirmed below .",
    "also , in @xcite we have shown that the dynamics of the system is insensitive to the sign of @xmath0 , since both the @xmath6mde and the final accelerated epoch do not depend on it .",
    "we will consider only @xmath77 .    in order to compare with the boomerang analysis i assume uniform priors as in @xcite , with the parameters confined in the range @xmath78 @xmath79  @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82  @xmath83 with the further weak big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) constraint @xmath84 ( and of course the condition @xmath85 ) .",
    "i evaluate the likelihood also using the most up - to - date bbn limit @xcite@xcite , assuming a gaussian prior for @xmath86 with mean @xmath87 and 1@xmath88 error @xmath89 ( i refer to this as the strong bbn prior ) .",
    "the range of @xmath75 includes all the values for which there is acceleration at the present .",
    "a further parameter , the logarithm of the absolute normalization of the @xmath90 spectrum , is integrated out analytically with uniform prior . the same age constraints ( @xmath91 gyr ) used in @xcite",
    "is adopted here .",
    "note that here we do not have the problem of near - degeneracy of parameters that is considered in ref .",
    "in fact , the degeneracy that exists for those values of @xmath92 and @xmath0 that give an identical angular - diameter distance to the decoupling surface is completely removed by the combined constraints of flatness , bbn and the allowed range of @xmath93 and @xmath75 .",
    "we also checked that the limits on @xmath94 and @xmath0 are broad enough to contain the bulk of likelihood .",
    "a grid of @xmath95 multipole cmb spectra @xmath90 is used as a database over which i interpolate to produce the likelihood function . since both the cobe and the boomerang data are in fact binned over intervals of multipoles , i average in the same bandpowers the theoretical spectra for a correct comparison .",
    "three cases will be distinguished : pure @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) ; dark energy ( @xmath98 ) ; coupled dark energy . in fig .",
    "1 i report examples of multipole spectra obtained varying @xmath75 and @xmath0 and fixing the other parameters : @xmath99 .",
    "the quantity plotted is actually @xmath100k as customary . the strong decrease in amplitude of the acoustic peaks",
    "as @xmath0 gets larger than 0.1 depends on the fact that for these values the onset of the @xmath6mde occurs before the decoupling . during the @xmath6mde the fluctuations smaller than the horizon grow less than during mde , so that the fluctuations on the acoustic scales are depressed relative to the larger scales .",
    "moreover , the addition of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect at small multipoles decreases the normalization of the intrinsic fluctuations at decoupling @xcite@xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 ( panels @xmath101 , solid lines ) i plot the likelihood function for the parameters @xmath102 @xmath103 ( marginalizing over all the other parameters ) in the case of pure @xmath96 and weak bbn prior .",
    "they are reasonably well in agreement with the analysis of @xcite ( their case p10 ) .",
    "the means and variances for the pure @xmath96 model are @xmath104 while the best estimates ( peaks ) are @xmath105 in agreement with @xcite ( notice that ref .",
    "@xcite quotes the likelihood maximum for clear detections , e.g. for @xmath106 and @xmath94 , and the mean in the other cases ) . for the case of uncoupled dark energy , i plot in fig .",
    "2 the likelihood functions in short dashed lines , plus in the panel @xmath25 the new parameter @xmath75 .",
    "as expected , there is almost complete degeneracy in the direction of @xmath75 , and the results of pure @xmath96 remain very similar . if the boomerang errorbars were reduced to one third , the likelihood would begin to show some preference for higher values of @xmath75 , as shown in the same panel @xmath25 ( dotted line ) . the problem of a high baryon content from boomerang ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) is not alleviated by this model of dark energy .",
    "the likelihood functions for the coupled dark energy case are plotted in fig .",
    "2 as long - dashed lines . due to the degeneracy along",
    "@xmath75 we can simplify the analysis fixing this parameter to any value in the relevant range ; we put @xmath107 .",
    "it turns out that the previous results are quite robust also with respect to the coupling , except for a shift of @xmath94 toward smaller values ( @xmath108 ) . in the panel @xmath109",
    "i plot the coupling @xmath0 : at the 96.8% c.l .",
    "we obtain @xmath110    assuming the strong bbn prior we obtain the likelihood functions shown as dot - dashed lines in the same fig .",
    "2 ( shown only for the coupled dark energy case for clarity ; the other cases are similar ) .",
    "as expected , smaller @xmath111 and smaller @xmath93 than before are now acceptable .",
    "also , @xmath112 moves to smaller values , in order not to decrease excessively the first peak .",
    "this effect , along with the decrease of @xmath94 in panel @xmath113 , is observed also in @xcite when the strong bbn is imposed .",
    "the likelihood for the exponential slope @xmath75 ( not shown ) becomes quite flatter with the strong bbn .",
    "interestingly , @xmath0 now peaks around 0.05 , because this value raises somewhat the first peak , compensating for the low baryon content .",
    "the limit ( [ lim ] ) remains valid .",
    "the most interesting conclusion that can be drawn from our analysis is that the coupling @xmath0 between dark matter and dark energy has to be smaller than 0.1 , an order of magnitude better than previously @xcite , independently of the bbn constraint .",
    "although i derived this limit in the particular case of an exponential potential , it extends to a much larger class of theories since the @xmath6mde is dominated by the kinetic , rather than potential , energy of the scalar field , as will be shown in another paper ,        the potential parameter @xmath46 , which sets the effective equation of state of the dark energy at the present , is not well constrained by the present cmb , since its effect is very recent on the cosmological time scale .",
    "it is of course possible to add further constraints from large - scale structure , supernovae ia and from other cmb experiments . in @xcite",
    "a constraint similar to ( [ lim ] ) was found from cluster abundance , for a particular choice of the other parameters .",
    "future data , especially high - resolution , high - coverage experiments on cmb , have the potential to strenghten the limit by at least another order of magnitude ."
