    "the top - heavy imf models include a significantly larger number of more massive stars , leading to a much faster heating of the stellar disk , as also observed in the simple models considered by @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : imf_rms ] , the nsc can further contribute to the disk heating , leading to @xmath157 higher rms eccentricity , but its contribution becomes negligible in the top - heavy imf cases , where the heating is dominated by the massive stars in the disk .    in order to compare these results with the measured rms eccentricity of the o - stars in the gc we now consider only the rms eccentricity of 3 - 40 m@xmath151 stars , more comparable to the o / b stars observed in the disk today .",
    "for an age of @xmath158 myrs for the gc stellar disk we expect an rms eccentricity of the order of 0.14 , significantly lower than the measured @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "evolution of the rms eccentricity of stars in the mass range @xmath159 corresponding to ob stars currently observed in the gc disk . ]      fig .",
    "[ fig : long_term_top ] shows the long term ( 100 myr ) evolution of the stellar populations in disks with continuous ( salpeter or top heavy ) imfs , where simplified stellar evolutionary mass loss is considered ( see section [ sub : stellar - evolution ] ) .",
    "as each of the modeled disks evolve , progressively more massive stars end their life and become lower mass stellar remnants .",
    "these ( now ) lower - mass remnants can then be heated much more effectively through mass - segregation processes .",
    "once the more massive stars evolve the role of the cusp heating becomes more significant , as be seen from the comparison between the no - nsc and cuspy nsc models .",
    "moreover , with the absence of high mass stars intermediate mass populations begin to cool , when no cusp exists ; but these same populations continue to heat up when a cusp population do exist .",
    "in this work we studied the evolution of a stellar disk around a mbh .",
    "we followed previous analytic models developed by @xcite , which considered two - body relaxation and mass segregation processes , and extended the models to include the effect of binary heating , and role of the nuclear cluster interactions with the disk , using several plausible models for the nsc .",
    "we also studied realistic mass function models for the disk stellar populations , and included simplified models for the stellar evolution of the stars .",
    "finally , we also explored the long term ( 100 myrs ) evolution of such disks . in the following we discuss our results and their implications for the role played by the different processes and components in sculpting the disk evolution .",
    "similar to the results of @xcite , we confirm that for isolated stellar disks , the disk heating is dominated by dynamical friction /mass - segregation processes in which the more massive stars heat the low mass stars .",
    "correspondingly , the more massive stars are cooled by the interaction with the low - mass stars , but two - body relaxation of the massive stars by themselves still keeps heating them .",
    "models with top - heavy mass function include a larger fraction of massive stars , and therefore allow for more rapid heating of the disk , producing larger rms eccentricities .    our models considered detailed mass - functions for the stars in the disk , allowing us to estimate the evolution of different stellar populations . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : imf ] , the disks develop mass stratification where higher mass stellar populations are expected to have significantly lower disk height scale and more circular orbits compared with the low mass stars in the disk .",
    "the existence , or lack of such mass stratification in the gc stellar disk could therefore be an important tool in assessing the processes involved in the evolution of the gc disk and its initial conditions .",
    "the effect of the nsc on the evolution of the stellar disk was not considers before in analytic models .",
    "the nsc stellar population has a high velocity dispersion , i.e. it is an effectively `` hotter '' population than the `` cool '' stellar disk population .",
    "the nsc can therefore potentially heat the stellar disk , even when it is composed of low - mass stars .",
    "our results suggest that a dense cuspy nsc can play a non - negligible , though limited role in heating the stellar disk .",
    "when the disk contains a large population of massive stars , these dominate the disk heating and evolution , and the nsc plays a relatively minor role .",
    "nevertheless , even young disks in which massive stars still exist are affected by the nsc , with top - heavy imf disks being relatively little affects , but salpeter - imf disks showing non - negligible heating up to @xmath157 higher rms eccentricities .",
    "the nsc effects are more prominent in cases where the disk is dominated by low mass stars . these include unrealistic cases of disks composed of low single - mass stars , but they also relevant for the long term evolution of stellar disks with realistic imfs . in the latter case stellar evolution leads to the transformation of massive stars into low mass stellar remnants over time . the effective mass - function of such evolving stellar disks therefore becomes progressively centered around lower mass stars and stellar remnants which replace the previously existing massive stars .",
    "correspondingly , the nsc heating of the cusp plays a progressively more dominant role in the disk evolution as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : long_term_top ] .",
    "in this study we extended the analytic study of stellar disk evolution to include binary heating processes . in principle",
    "the binding energy stored in binaries is significant ; however , the rate of energy exchange between the binaries and the single stars in the disk is slow .",
    "therefore , binary heating is inefficient in heating the stellar disk , compared with two - body relaxation and mass - segregation processes .",
    "these results are consistent with n - body simulation results which included binaries done by @xcite .",
    "note that we consider the overall averaged evolution of the stellar disk population ; atypical single - binary encounters with short - period massive binaries can lead to strong kicks ejecting stars at high velocities , even beyond the escape velocity from the nsc @xcite .",
    "such encounters may produce a small number of outlying stars at highly eccentric / inclined orbits , but are not likely to significantly affect the overall evolution of the disk and its averaged properties ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the disk evolution over times as long as 100 myrs is slow .",
    "two - body relaxation is too inefficient for the disk to assimilate into the nuclear cluster on such timescales .",
    "the disk structure is expected to keep its coherency , and be observed as a relatively thin disk even at 100 myrs .",
    "this suggests that the existence of older disks formed before the one currently observed in the gc might still be inferred from the stellar kinematics of older , lower mass stars , which may still show a disk - like struture , unless destroyed / smeared by other non - two - body relaxation processes .",
    "our analytic approach considered the role of two - body relaxation and binary heating , and included realistic disk and nsc components . however ,",
    "secular processes and possible collective effects are beyond the scope of such a model ; we briefly review studies of these processes .",
    "resonant relaxation processes @xcite could potentially lead to fast evolution of disk stars inclinations through the vector resonant relaxation ( and slower evolution of the eccentricities ) , especially in the inner parts of the disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that resonant relaxation can produce significant effects , however they assumed an unrealistic effective mass of nsc stars , which is 5 - 10 times larger than expected in the gc ( even when including stellar black holes ) .",
    "further study of this effect under realistic conditions could shed more light on this issue .",
    "fast two - body relaxation as well as secular evolution of disk stars could also be induced by massive coherent components , massive perturbers @xcite such as molecular clouds , stellar clusters , intermediate black hole or a second stellar disk @xcite .",
    "whether such objects exist / had existed in such configurations as to influence the evolution of the stellar disk is still actively studied .",
    "@xcite considered the collective eccentric disk instability effect .",
    "such effect could lead to rapid change in the distribution of eccentricities in the disk , but it requires initially highly eccentric disk ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such a process may give rise to a significant population of highly eccentric stars in the disk ; which are not seen in most recent studies @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that by their nature , most of the collective and secular effects mentioned above affect both low mass and high mass stars in a similar manner , leading to similar eccentricity distribution . discerning the kinematic properties of low mass vs. high mass stars is therefore highly important in order to understand the roles of such processes compared with stellar two - body relaxation processes that lead to mass stratification , as shown here in details .",
    "in particular , non - dependence of the stellar kinematics on the stellar masses would strongly suggest collective effects dominate the stellar disk evolution .",
    "the observed eccentricity of o - stars in the stellar disk in the gc , @xmath121 @xcite , is higher than that obtained in the realistic models considered here .",
    "this suggest either initial conditions with significantly higher eccentricities for the disk stars , or that other processes besides two - body relaxation play an important role in the disk evolution .",
    "detailed studies of the eccentricity / inclination distribution of disk stars as a function of mass is not currently available , ( but see @xcite for important global statistical trends ) . moreover ,",
    "lower mass b - stars in these regions may have a different origin than the disk , and may have been captured following a binary disruption @xcite ; such stars would have high eccentricities @xcite and may mask the real distribution of the disk stars eccentricities .",
    "nevertheless , a focused study on stars most likely related to the disk , and their eccentricity - mass relation is highly desirable to asses the existence of possible mass stratification in the stellar disk .    finally , two body relaxation processes suggest a factor of two ratio between the eccentricities and inclination of stars in the disk , while different relation might be expected from other processes ( e.g. secular kozai - like evolution induced by an inclined massive structure ) . a good handle on",
    "the eccentricity vs. inclination from observation could give additional clues on the dynamical processes involved .",
    "in this study we analyzed the evolution of a stellar disk around a massive black hole due to two - body relaxation processes and binary heating .",
    "we explored realistic mass functions for the disk stars , and included the effects of two - body relaxation by the nuclear cluster stellar population in which the disk is embedded .",
    "we also considered the effects of stellar evolution and studied the long term evolution of such disks .",
    "the disk evolution is dominated by dynamical friction from the massive stars in the disk , while binary heating plays only a negligible role in the disk evolution .",
    "the nuclear cluster plays a minor role in the disk evolution as long as a large population of massive stars exist , as in the case of a young disk with a top - heavy mass function ; it can play a more significant , though still modest role in heating a disk with a salpeter mass function . due to stellar evolution",
    "the effective mass - function of the disk becomes progressively centered around lower mass stars and stellar remnants which replace the previously existing massive stars .",
    "correspondingly , disk heating by the nuclear cluster plays a progressively more dominant role in the disk evolution .",
    "we find that significant mass stratification arises from mass - segregation processes in the disk .",
    "this could serve as a signature for two - body relaxation dominating the disk evolution .",
    "in contrast , collective and secular effects are typically insensitive to the masses of individual stars in the disk , and would not produce mass stratification .",
    "the observed rms eccentricity of the o - stars in the stellar disk in the galactic center ( @xmath160 ) is larger than obtained in any of our models with realistic conditions , suggesting either an initially hot and/or eccentric disk or that other secular / collective effects play an important role in the disk evolution .",
