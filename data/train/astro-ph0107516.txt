    "much astronomical effort has been expended to investigate the structure of the universe on ever larger scales .",
    "surveys of galaxies in emission , studies of intergalactic gas clouds in absorption , and searches for anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background indicate a universe approaching homogeneity on scales larger than a few hundred mpc ( e.g. , peebles 1993 ) .",
    "velocity and density variations , smoothed over increasingly larger volumes , decrease steadily , in agreement with current cosmological n - body and hydro - simulations .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate how the density and velocity fluctuations behave on the _ smallest _ scales . even limiting ourselves to randomly chosen regions ( which have densities far short of those encountered in stars and",
    "other highly collapsed objects ) the answer is complex and must depend strongly on the local mean density .",
    "large density fluctuations on very small ( parsec ) scales occur in the _ interstellar _ medium .",
    "the _ intergalactic _ medium ( igm ) , at least as observed at high redshifts , occupies an intermediate range between large scale homogeneity and small scale fragmentation . the combination of low density and photo - ionization heating by the meta - galactic uv background conspire to prevent catastrophic collapse and cooling . in the absence of discrete sources of momentum , heat , or ionization ,",
    "any small scale structure below the jeans mass should be smoothed out by the thermal pressure of the intergalactic gas .",
    "the nature of small scale structure in the igm has received renewed interest with the advent of high resolution gasdynamic simulations of structure formation .",
    "it is possible to measure various cosmological and astrophysical quantities by comparing hydro - simulations of the general baryon distribution with observations of ly@xmath0  forest absorption lines ( e.g. , cen et al .",
    "1994 ; petitjean , muecket , & kates 1995 ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ; miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 ; wadsley & bond 1996 ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 ; croft et al 1997 ; theuns et al .",
    "1998 ; bryan et al 1999 ; dav et al 1999 ) . in spite of the successes of the models in reproducing the observed ly@xmath0 forest absorption",
    ", there is some concern that the finite mass resolution may limit quantitative conclusions as to the thermodynamics and ionization state of the gas .",
    "for example , the optical depth of an absorption line for a given value of the background density is approximately proportional to the clumpiness of the gas .",
    "consequently , a locally denser gas could , to some degree , mimic a universe with a a larger baryon density and still satisfy the observational constraints ( see rauch et al 1997 ; weinberg et al .",
    "thus , estimates of the baryon density in the intergalactic medium depend on either the simulations properly resolving those low- to intermediate column density structures in the igm that contain most of the baryons , or on the absence of any significant small scale structure . since the jeans mass @xmath8 varies proportional to @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "there is always a redshift where the mimimum resolved mass exceeds @xmath8 , so small scale structure present at high redshift could pose a problem .",
    "there are good reasons for concern that such structure may exist at some level .",
    "velocity gradients of several kms@xmath3 , or appreciable density differences over distances of a few hundred parsecs in _ low column density _ gas , might imply that already at high redshift much of the matter is trapped in unresolved , small potential wells ; alternatively , the gas may have been stirred by non - gravitational agents such as galactic winds and explosions ( e.g. , couchman & rees 1986 ) .",
    "the widespread metal enrichment in the intergalactic medium shows that such galactic outflows must have occured .",
    "there have been several theoretical attempts trying to understand this result ( e.g. , ferrara , pettini , & shchekinov 2000 ; theuns , mo & schaye 2001 , ; cen & bryan 2001 ; madau , ferrara , & rees 2001 ; aguirre et al 2001 ) , but little is known about the hydrodynamical consequences of these ancient winds for the igm .",
    "finally , it has been argued that even at high redshift many ly@xmath0 forest absorption lines are formed in extended galactic halos ( chen et al 2000 ) , in which case one should expect to see small scale hydro - dynamic disturbances in the gas caused by stellar feedback .    the only way to test for the possibility of hidden small scale structure and of a universe grainier than envisaged by the simulations is to _ measure _ by how much the universal density and velocity fields fluctuate on a given spatial scale .",
    "differences in the absorption pattern of the ly@xmath0 forest in closely spaced lines of sight to gravitationally lensed qsos can be used to measure the clumpiness of the igm on sub - kpc scales , about an order of magnitude smaller than can currently be resolved by cosmological simulations .",
    "such observations have been used to establish lower limits on the sizes of the ly@xmath0 forest clouds ( e.g. , young et al . , 1981 ; weymann & foltz 1983 ; foltz et al . 1984 ; smette et al .",
    "1993,1995 ; bechtold & yee 1995 ; petry et al 1998 ) .",
    "most of the above investigations have shown the difference between the lines of sight to be small . in the previous paper ( rauch , sargent , & barlow 2001 , paper ii ) , the second in a series of papers on the small scale properties of various gaseous environments at high redshift , we found that the metal enriched gas observed in civ absorption systems , apparently produced in extended regions around redshift galaxies , shows signs of having been disturbed hydrodynamically on time - scales similar to those relevant for recurrent star - formation .",
    "this is consistent with the civ gas clouds being the result of ancient galactic outflows .",
    "the civ absorbing gas is mostly related to strong saturated ly@xmath0 forest systems , and the question remained open as to how far the lower density igm ( causing the much more frequent , unsaturated ly@xmath0 forest systems ) has been affected . in the present paper",
    ", we use the keck hires spectrograph ( vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) to investigate the fabric of the ly@xmath0 forest proper on sub - kpc scales at high signal - to - noise ratio and with a velocity resolution sufficient to resolve the width of the lyman lines and detect velocity gradients of a few hundred ms@xmath3 .",
    "the most suitable object known for this sort of study is the ultrabright , quadruple , gravitationally lensed qso q1422 + 231 ( @xmath11 ; patnaik et al 1992 ) .",
    "this object has been observed for similar purposes previously at low resolution .",
    "bechtold & yee ( 1995 ) concluded from ground - based spectra that there are differences of typically about 50%  in hi column density for beam separations on the order of 100 parsec .",
    "in contrast , petry , impey & foltz ( 1998 ) , from hst fos spectra found very little difference both in column density and velocity between the various lines of sight . in section 2 we describe keck hires ( vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) spectra of the a and c images of q1422 + 231 .",
    "the properties of this lens system are summarized on the castles web site ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/castles/b1422.html ) .",
    "the observations of images a and c of q1422 + 231 and the methods used to reduce the data are discussed in section 2 .",
    "section 3 contains an account of the measurement of the differences in the lyman @xmath0 lines in the spectra of the two images .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "q1422 + 231 consists of four images .",
    "images a ( g= 16.92 magn . ) , b ( 16.77 magn . ) and c ( 17.44 magn . ) are almost along a line with c separated by 1.64 `` from a and 0.76 '' from b. image d ( 20.56 magn . )",
    "is well separated from the rest .",
    "we chose to obtain hires spectra of a and c , using a 0.56 \" slit and only observing in conditions of excellent seeing .",
    "much of the guiding was done manually and the position angle of the slit was chosen so as to keep image b out of the slit . in some exposures we guided on the outer edge of the image in order to ensure minimal contamination from b. the dataset is the same as described in papers i ( rauch , sargent & barlow 1999 ) and ii ( rauch , sargent & barlow 2001 ) . the spectra were reduced as described in barlow & sargent ( 1996 ) .",
    "the individual a and c exposures were matched in flux to a template produced by adding up all a spectra , using polynomial fits typically of 8th order per echelle order .",
    "care was taken to include only points with flux levels close to the continuum in the fitting regions , and to avoid absorption lines .",
    "this way , the large scale features in the spectra become identical ( the information on large scale differences between the qso continua is lost ) but features on scales up to @xmath12 300 - 400 kms@xmath3 are retained .",
    "thus , differences among individual absorption line profiles up to that velocity scale survive our matching procedure and remain unaffected .",
    "the resulting spectra were normalized to a unit continuum using spline functions .",
    "voigt profiles were fitted to the absorption lines using the fitting routine vpfit ( carswell et al .",
    "1991 , see http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/  rfc / vpfit.html ) , until the fit exceeded a minimum probability ( 1% ) to produce by chance a @xmath13 as high as the one attained .",
    "we departed here from previous such analyses in that the whole spectrum was fitted ( in continuous pieces ) , without selecting significant absorption features by eye .",
    "we thus do not have to assign significance thresholds to individual lines , a procedure which is most meaningful for single unblended , strong absorption components , but which becomes uncertain in more complicated situations .",
    "another problem , peculiar to relatively high signal - to - noise ratio spectra such as those obtained with hires , is that it is hard to obtain satisfactory fits merely by superimposing voigt profiles , even if voigt profiles are a good physical model .",
    "when s / n ratios exceed a few tens , the errors in the fit are invariably dominated by systematic uncertainties in the placement of the continuum level .",
    "therefore , it was decided to treat the continuum in every fitting region ( average length 28  ) as a free parameter .",
    "this resulted in a mean drop of the continuum level over the region [ 4747 , 5630 ] (i.e .",
    ", between ly@xmath14 and ly@xmath0 emission , where the ly@xmath0  analysis in the present paper was performed ) to 99.3 % of the original level , with a standard deviation of 2.7% of the original continuum level , i.e. , the total continuum level remained virtually unaffected by introducing locally free continua , but the local continua were adjusted typically by 2.7% up or down , to obtain an optimal fit .    since the a and c images are so close to b we have to be concerned that blending of the spectrum of an image with light from the other images might have reduced the differences seen between the spectra",
    "however , our spectra show strong column density differences between the a and c images in some low ionization metal lines in the lyman @xmath0 forest ( see paper i ) which would have been significantly reduced if spillover of light from different images had been a serious problem forest lines in um673a , b is consistent within the errors with the very small differences found in the present paper . ] .",
    "our technique of matching the two spectra to a common template as described earlier _ does _ take out the large scale fluctuations but not those among individual lines .",
    "again , the differences seen in metal line systems suggest that this is not a problem . finally , while they may affect the measured _ column densities _ , none of these effects could conspire to reduce any actual intrinsic _ velocity _ differences between the lines of sight to values as tiny as those found here .",
    "the lowest redshift covered by the selected spectral region , @xmath15 , corresponds to a transverse separation @xmath16 pc . throughout the paper beam separations",
    "are computed for @xmath17 kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 and @xmath18 .",
    "the redshift of the lens is taken to be z = 0.338 ( kundic et al .",
    "here we describe three main approaches to measuring differences between the ly@xmath0  forests in the two adjacent lines of sight : a global cross - correlation analysis ; a search for column density and velocity differences among individual absorption lines ; and a pixel by pixel measurement of relative fluctuations in the optical depth between the lines of sight .",
    "we can study global differences in the ly@xmath0  forest region by measuring the cross - correlation function , @xmath19 , over the total , useable length of both spectra .",
    "we define this quantity by @xmath20    here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the pixel flux values of the two spectra , separated by @xmath23 on the plane of the sky .",
    "the velocity coordinate along the line of sight is @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 is the velocity lag .",
    "the averages are taken over the whole velocity extent of the spectrum . for @xmath27 =",
    "0 we get the usual auto - correlation function @xmath28 , while for @xmath26 = 0 we have the cross - correlation as a function of transverse separation only .",
    "the function is defined so as to satisfy @xmath29 . with large scale velocity correlations ( @xmath30 1000 kms@xmath3 ) expected to be absent or weak ( sargent et al . 1980 ) , the autocorrelation function ( on scales @xmath12 100 kms@xmath3 )",
    "mostly measures the ly@xmath0  line width and the weak small scale clustering of ly@xmath0  forest systems ( e.g. , webb 1987 , rauch et al .",
    "we apply the correlation analysis to most of the spectral region between lyman @xmath14 and lyman @xmath0 emission , [ 4737 , 5630 ]  .",
    "only regions [ 4747 , 4875 ] , [ 4895,4997 ] , [ 5003,5221 ] , [ 5227,5409 ] , [ 5419,5473 ] , and [ 5480,5630 ]   were used in the analysis in order to avoid contamination by known metal systems .",
    "these regions are shown in fig . 1 ; the hatched parts were excluded .",
    "the resulting mean redshift @xmath31 = 3.26036 of the remaining sample corresponds to a mean beam separation @xmath32 ( = 119 h@xmath33pc ) . a small portion of the spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "the spectrum of image c ( dotted line ) is overplotted on that of a ( solid line ) , to illustrate how closely the spectra resemble each other .",
    "the function @xmath34 is shown in fig .",
    "in particular , we obtain the `` zero - lag '' cross - correlation function : @xmath35 thus , over a mean transverse distance of 120 pc the appearance of the ly@xmath0  forest changes very little , and even the small difference observed may be due to noise or systematic errors .",
    "we next investigate how properties of individual absorption systems change with the separation on the plane of the sky .",
    "we can quantify differences @xmath36 in any physical property @xmath37 of absorption systems common to both lines of sight 1 and 2 by means of the distribution function of @xmath38 .",
    "( for example , consider the difference between the redshifts of the lines , @xmath39 ) . in an isotropic universe ,",
    "the mean , @xmath40 , vanishes , so the information is contained in the shape of the distribution of differences , as characterised , for example , by the _ observed _ scatter of the distribution , @xmath41 .",
    "the width of the _ intrinsic _ distribution , @xmath42 , differs from the _ observed _ one due to the combined measurement errors , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and any systematic error @xmath45 resulting from the occasional erroneous pairing of two unrelated absorption components .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 = @xmath47 is then a strict _ upper limit _ on the intrinsic scatter , @xmath42 .",
    "here we concentrate on the distribution of _ velocity _ and _ column density _ differences , @xmath26 and @xmath48 .",
    "inspection by eye shows that there are only minute difference between the spectra of the a and c images .",
    "accordingly , it is legitimate to associate each lyman @xmath0 forest line in the spectrum of component a with a corresponding line in c. thus , after profile - fitting the spectra , we suppose that an absorption component in spectrum c belongs to the same underlying physical structure as a line in a if its redshift and column density fall within a given redshift and column density window centered on a similar component in the a spectrum .",
    "we make the assignments totally automatically in order to preclude human prejudice . in order to avoid too many random associations we restrict the allowed range of column density differences when measuring the relative velocity distribution , and restrict the allowed range of velocity differences when comparing the column densities . specifically , the redshifts had to agree to within @xmath49 30 kms@xmath3 ( there is no real prejudice as this is much larger than the actual scatter ) , while column density differences @xmath50logn@xmath51 ",
    "logn@xmath52 @xmath53 1 were deemed acceptable . in order to avoid including ill - constrained measurements and spurious cross - identifications , all lines included",
    "were required to have relative doppler parameter errors , @xmath54 @xmath533 and column density errors @xmath55@xmath533 .",
    "doppler parameter values had to fall in the interval [ 5 , 300 ] kms@xmath3 to exclude spuriously low values due to noise spikes and high values due to unresolved blends .",
    "all error estimates given below are 1-sigma deviations derived from the output of the line profile fitting program .",
    "finally , to get rid of obvious mis - associations , one iteration of a 4-@xmath56 clipping algorithm was performed .",
    "column density differences larger than 4 standard deviations of the mean of the distribution of column density differences where rejected .",
    "the analysis was limited to column densities 12@xmath57 , the lower bound being close to the detection limit , whereas the upper limit ( 14.13 ) corresponds to a residual flux of about 2.4 % ( for a doppler parameter of 28 kms@xmath3 , typical of an unsaturated @xmath58 ly@xmath0 forest line ) , a value just at the top of the linear part of the curve of growth , but far enough away from saturation to permit us to see significant differences between the central optical depths .",
    "this column density regime is most relevant for the study of gravitational structure formation since the selected absorption lines probe gas overdensities still close to the linear regime of gravitational instability ( @xmath59 ) on the scale of individual galaxies ( e.g. , miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "4 shows the observed histogram of velocity differences , @xmath60 .",
    "this shift amounts to slightly less than half a pixel or a quarter of the slit width .",
    "its size and the circumstances of the observations make it most likely that it was caused by systematic variations in the position of the target on the slit : the targets were only observed in exceptional seeing to minimize contamination of the desired image by the light from other images .",
    "consequently , the seeing may often have been better than the 0.574 \" slit width , leading to a dependence of the wavelength zero point on the actual position of the target in the slit .",
    "this uncertainty may have been turned into a systematic shift by our attempts to avoid spillover .",
    "for the analysis below and for all the plots from fig . 4 on , the above shift was subtracted from the velocities of the c spectrum . ] . the top plot of fig .",
    "5 shows the observed standard deviations of the distribution of velocity differences between the two lines of sight ( solid dots ) , versus the largest measurement error in redshift for lines remaining in the sample .",
    "the open diamonds show the predicted width of the distribution of velocity differences expected from statistical measurement errors alone .",
    "it was computed as the quadratic sum of the @xmath61 error estimates produced by the voigt profile fitting routine . to search for intrinsic scatter we discard those velocity differences with large errors .",
    "as the most uncertain points are eliminated , the observed width of the distribution should decrease , and any intrinsic scatter should emerge .",
    "we see that , the further one goes to the left along the abscissa , the line pairs remaining in the sample have smaller and smaller maximum ( and mean ) redshift errors and the more well defined are the measurements . in other words , if the bulk of the scatter is caused by measurement error , we should expect to see the observed total scatter @xmath62 decreasing in step with , and closely tracking , the measurement errors as increasingly stringent error limits are applied and more and more data points are discarded from the distribution . aside from a certain scatter ( probably caused by mis - matched components )",
    "this behaviour is indeed observed in fig.5 .",
    "( the discrepancy at large values of the abscissa between the width of the predicted distribution based on measurement errors alone , and the observed distribution , is an artifact of the range of parameters we imposed earlier .",
    "it is caused by our admitting only velocity differences @xmath63 kms@xmath3 into the sample .",
    "this is perfectly justified given the range of the large majority of values in figure 4 , but it does get rid of some large outliers which result from automatic mis - identifications of line pairs . )    to demonstrate the sensitivity of this method , we plot ( for illustrative purposes ) the observed @xmath62 a second time ( dashed line in the top panel of fig .",
    "5 ) , but now with an additional random , gaussian velocity jitter of @xmath56=1.5 kms@xmath3 imposed on each line pair , i.e. , the distribution of pair velocity differences has now a width of @xmath64 . on the left half of the diagram this jitter clearly dominates the observed width , demonstrating that any intrinsic velocity differences of that size would have been seen easily and that any actual differences must be considerably less than 1.5 kms@xmath3 .",
    "there are 259 line pairs with individual redshift errors @xmath65@xmath53 4@xmath6610@xmath67 with an _ observed _ total @xmath68 = 1.7 kms@xmath3 , and still 83 pairs in the bin with the smallest errors , @xmath65@xmath69 ( @xmath68 = 0.6 kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "the upper limits @xmath70 on the _ intrinsic _ @xmath71 ( where the measurement errors have been subtracted in quadrature from the observed width ) are formally 0.4 and 0.2 kms@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "given the scatter between the measurement errors and total @xmath62 visible in the plot , the intrinsic distribution is probably consistent with zero width .",
    "we can compare these values with the velocity differences expected from the hubble expansion alone .",
    "if ly@xmath0 clouds expand with the hubble flow the projected velocity differences between two lines of sight , ( modelling the geometry by an expanding slab intersecting both lines of sight at an angle @xmath0 ) , would be on the order of @xmath72 , where @xmath73 kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 was adopted as the hubble constant at the mean observed redshift .",
    "this is well below our detection threshold and our null result is consistent with the clouds following the hubble flow .",
    "it is tempting to try using the measurement of @xmath62 to get a rough idea of the energy deposited in the gas in the form of turbulence . in paper",
    "ii we had applied the kolmogorov relation between the structure function @xmath74 , and the energy input rate @xmath75 at scale @xmath76 , @xmath77 ^ 2}\\   \\approx   \\ ( \\epsilon\\ r)^{2/3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "( e.g. , kaplan & pikelner 1970 ; here @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the velocities along the line of sight , and @xmath76 is the spatial separation between the lines of sight , and the average is taken over all absorption line pairs with mean transverse separation @xmath76 ) to get an approximate estimate of the energy input rate @xmath75 in civ absorbing clouds .",
    "these gas clouds correspond to strong , usually saturated ly@xmath0 forest systems and overdensities higher than a few tens .",
    "this approach could be justified then as we had indeed observed turbulent energy on a wide range of scales and had found a rise of @xmath74 with @xmath76 ; moreover the relevant time scales for energy dissipation were short , so turbulent energy must have been propagating down over a range of scales close to the epoch of observation .",
    "now we are applying this scheme to the lower density gas giving rise to unsaturated low column density ly@xmath0 lines , which has densities within a factor of 10  15 of the mean density of the universe , and , at average , must be situated much further away from sources of stellar energy . here",
    "it is more likely that any energy injection by stellar feedback is intermittent or happened only once long ago so a steady state ( one of the conditions for the validity of the kolmogorov law ) may not exist ( or no longer exists ) .    with this warning in mind",
    "we proceed to calculate @xmath75 for our present low column density ly@xmath0 forest sample .",
    "the quantity @xmath75 is still a measure of the energy flow on a given scale , but is not necessarily related to the current primary energy input on larger scales ( e.g. , by explosions or winds ) .",
    "if we identify our measured variance @xmath80 with @xmath74 , we can solve for the energy transfer rate .",
    "] at scale @xmath76 :    @xmath81    adopting the above value @xmath82kms@xmath3 , and @xmath83 pc , @xmath84 thus the intergalactic medium giving rise to the unsaturated parts ( i.e. , most ) of the ly@xmath0 forest at z=3.26 is experiencing energy transfer at a rate three to four orders of magnitude less than the gas giving rise to the civ absorption systems dealt with in paper ii , and six to seven orders of magnitude less than the values in the orion nebula , for example .      a scatter plot of the column densities in a and c is given in fig .",
    "the scatter is larger in the c image because of the lower signal - to - noise ratio there .",
    "some of the outliers may come from the ambiguity of the voigt profile models ( which occasionally may lead to similar absorption complexes being modelled automatically by two rather different sets of voigt profile components ) , while others may be genuine differences due to unidentified metal lines .",
    "the distribution of column density differences is shown in fig.7 .",
    "two components were considered to correspond to each other , when they were nearest neighbors , lay within 30 kms@xmath3 of each other , and had column densities differing by less than 1.0 dex .",
    "8 shows the scatter versus measurement error diagram for column densities , similar to figure 5 . for the best defined samples ( those with measurement errors around 5@xmath6610@xmath85 in @xmath86 ) the corrected upper limit to the intrinsic scatter",
    "is @xmath87@xmath12 @xmath88 .",
    "we note that it makes sense to discuss an ` optimum sample ' because discarding those data points with the largest measurement error leaves better measurements but also reduces the sample size and thus the statistical significance . initially throwing away the points with the worst error",
    "will improve the precision with which sample mean and variance are known , but the precision of these statistical values decreases with the square root of the number of data points , @xmath89 and if enough points have been lost the penalty gets larger than the gain . in the appendix",
    "we have defined a function of merit , @xmath90 , which is positive as long as it is beneficial to discard data points , and crosses zero towards negative values if the sample becomes to small .",
    "the bottom panels of figures 5 and 8 show this function .",
    "for example , from the column density case ( fig .",
    "8) we find that the sample has been cut down to optimal size by retaining only data points with a maximum column density error @xmath91 .",
    "most interesting from an astrophysical point of view is whether we can put limits on the total baryon density fluctuations on the scale of the transverse separations of the two lines of sight .",
    "the relation between the hi column density n(hi ) and the baryon density for jeans - smoothed igm regions can be written as @xmath92 with @xmath0 = 1.37  1.5 ( schaye 2001 ) .",
    "for this power law the distribution of _ column density _",
    "differences @xmath48 (= @xmath93  @xmath94 ) can be transformed by simple scaling with 1/@xmath0 = 0.73 ( we use the smaller value @xmath95 to establish the most conservative upper limit ) into a distribution of _ density _ differences , and the variance of the logarithmic baryon density becomes @xmath96 adopting ( conservatively ) the pair sample with mean column density measurement errors below 0.05 dex ( 153 lines ; see fig .",
    "8) we arrive at a value of @xmath97 for the corrected `` intrinsic '' scatter and @xmath98 for the uncorrected , observed scatter in @xmath48 . as the figures show , other choices of sample size give similar values .",
    "then we get @xmath99 for the typical logarithmic change in density on a scale of 0.110 h@xmath100 kpc , i.e. , the rms fluctuation in the baryon density is less than about 3.1 percent . from the close agreement between the width of the observed distribution and the expected width from measurement errors alone ,",
    "it is clear that the fluctuations are dominated by the measurement errors and that the intrinsic fluctuations are consistent with being zero at our level of precision .",
    "here we address the question as to how much of the universe ( by volume ) is hydrodynamically disturbed , for example by supernova explosions or galactic winds along the two lines of sight .",
    "we consider a region in space at a given redshift @xmath101 as disturbed , if the optical depth @xmath102 for hi ly@xmath0 absorption differs by more than a certain amount between the two lines of sight .",
    "this is easy to measure unless the lines are saturated .",
    "many of the saturated systems are associated with multi - component metal absorption systems .",
    "these systems exhibit substantial variations in the absorption pattern across multiple , close lines of sight ( e.g. lopez et al 1998 ; paper ii ) , but the component structure and any differences in the column densities are almost always completely obscured in the strong , saturated hi ly@xmath0 absorption blends .",
    "thus , to get a conservative upper limit on the fraction of disturbed regions we assume that saturated regions in the ly@xmath0 forest are always disturbed , i.e. , we treat them as if they had infinite optical depth differences .",

    "the four different histograms show the results for various column density ranges . ] ( the column density in spectrum a was used to determine whether a pixel pair fell into a certain range ) : the solid line is for the whole spectrum , the dashed one for weak lines with @xmath106 , the dash - dotted one for @xmath107 , and the dotted one for stronger , but still unsaturated , lines .",
    "( a column density @xmath108 corresponds to a residual flux of 2.4% for the center of an absorption line with a typical doppler parameter @xmath109 kms@xmath3 ) . in the first histogram ( solid line )",
    ", saturated pixels ( for practical purposes those with @xmath110 ) , did not provide any information and were assumed to have infinite optical depth differences @xmath111 ; thus they do not appear in this histogram in the lower bins .",
    "the relative proportions of the spectra in those four column ranges was 100% , 36.6% , 36.4% , and 17.4% , respectively . to reduce contributions to the optical depth differences from noise ,",
    "both spectra were smoothed with a box filter on the scale of typical line broadening ( 28 kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "we found that 76.8% , 98.7% , 74.7% , and 46.7% , respectively , of all the pixels in the four column bins had their optical depths differ between the two lines of sight by less than @xmath112 ( i.e. , they contribute only to the first bin of fig .",
    "it is remarkable that of the 36.6% of all pixels which are in the column density range @xmath113 ,  98.7% agree to within @xmath114 .",
    "apparently , the low column density ly@xmath0 forest is virtually undisturbed by any effects capable of producing differences in density over a couple of hundred parsecs .",
    "the differences in optical depth increase with increasing column density as one would expect if higher column density gas is more closely associated with galaxies , which are the likely origin of any hydrodynamic disturbances .",
    "the overall fraction of the ly@xmath0 forest with @xmath115 irrespective of column density is @xmath116% .",
    "since we have counted regions close to or beyond saturation as having infinite @xmath117 ( see above ) , @xmath118 is a strict upper limit on the line - of - sight filling factor of the ly@xmath0 forest with absorption from processed gas capable of producing a disturbance of that magnitude .",
    "the upper limit @xmath119 on the fraction of disturbed pixels in the ly@xmath0 forest can be used in a crude way to estimate the number density and volume filling factor of galactic outflows from their effect on the density field of the igm , in sofar as such variations appear as differences between the hi column densities ( ly@xmath0 forest opacities ) between two close lines of sight .",
    "the principle will be illustrated here for a model of windbubbles expanding into the intergalactic medium ( fig .",
    "we assume that dense shells of swept up material occasionally cross the double lines of sight to a lensed background qso .",
    "it can be shown ( see appendix b ) that even under unfavorable conditions the shells should have hi column densities high enough to be seen in absorption in a high signal to noise ratio qso spectrum like the one of q1422 + 231 discussed here ( n(hi)@xmath120cm@xmath85 ) .",
    "the passage of the shell is very likely to disturb the resemblance between the absorption lines in the two lines of sight ( fig .",
    "ideally , the shell should produce two absorption systems at its two points of intersection with the lines of sight .",
    "we assume that there will be measurable differences in the absorption lines between the lines of sight as long as new shell material keeps crossing the lines of sight faster than the differences can be smoothed out by pressure waves travelling at the sound speed . or in other words , a shell is no longer detectable for when the speed of sound @xmath122 exceeds the transverse velocity of the shell across the lines of sight : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the impact parameter of the lines of sight relative to the center of the shell , and @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the radius and expanding velocity of the shell .    to convert the line - of - sight filling factor into a volume filling factor a particular model for the disturbance and its observational signature is needed . for illustrative purposes we adopt the supershell model of maclow & mccray ( 1988 ) , i.e.",
    ", we assume that the disturbances are wind - blown shells escaping from high redshift galaxies . for a given line - of - sight filling factor , the radius @xmath125 , velocity of the shell @xmath126 ,",
    "volume filling factor @xmath127 , and the space density @xmath128 of galaxies with a wind escaping into the igm can be written in terms of the mechanical luminosity @xmath129 ( in units of @xmath130 ergs / s ) , the density of the ambient medium @xmath131 ( in units of @xmath132 @xmath133 ) , and the age of the wind bubble @xmath134 ( in units of @xmath135 years ) .",
    "these relations are given in appendix @xmath136 .",
    "figures 11 and 12 show the dependence of the upper limits on @xmath128 and @xmath127 for winds of various strengths ( i.e. , with the ratio @xmath137 as the distinguishing parameter ) corresponding to the upper limit @xmath119 on the fraction of disturbed pixels in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the model is highly oversimplified in that it assumes spherical bubbles with a single age and a single combination of l@xmath138 and @xmath128 , propagating through a homogeneous medium ( and the expansion of the universe is not taken into account ) , but it contains several features likely to be relevant to more realistic future models ( figs .",
    "11 and 12 ) :    \\1 .",
    "the number of galaxies with winds originating close to the epoch of observation ( @xmath139 ) is essentially unconstrained by an observation of the line of sight filling factor ( fig.11 ) .",
    "this is because the shell radii are so small that even a large number of galaxies with winds would produce a negligible total absorption cross section .",
    "weak winds ( low luminosity and / or large density of ambient medium , i.e. , @xmath140 ) , because of their limited lifetime , escape detection if they originated early ( e.g. , before @xmath141 for a @xmath142 shell , or before @xmath143 for a @xmath144 shell ; fig .",
    "strong winds ( @xmath145 ) remain detectable even if they started a hubble time ago ( fig .",
    "11 ) , and the upper limit on their numbers becomes stronger with increasing redshift @xmath146 .",
    "the volume filling factor ( fig .",
    "12 ) is most tightly constrained for recent rather than old winds , independent of strength .",
    "our observation can not exclude that the universe is filled with ancient , weak wind bubbles because they would no longer be detectable with the present method by redshift @xmath147 ( see item 2 above ) .",
    "since these weak winds do not reach far out from galaxies and galaxies are not distributed randomly it is very unlikely that such bubbles could fill a substantial fraction of the voids . strong winds ( @xmath145 ) are much better constrained because of their long lifetimes : if winds of strength @xmath148 started as early as @xmath149 , they could be filling up to about 40% of the volume of the universe by redshift z = 3.26 .",
    "if such strong winds arose at @xmath150 they may fill up to 18% .",
    "we have applied various methods to search for and measure density and velocity structure on 100 pc scales in the intergalactic medium at @xmath5 .",
    "the smallness of the differences in column density and velocity between the lines of sight confirm and extend the results of smette et al ( 1992,1995 ) , and petry , impey & foltz ( 1998 ) . in the unsaturated regions of the ly@xmath0 forest rms differences between the projected line of sight velocities over 120 pc",
    "do not exceed a few hundred meters per second .",
    "the rms total density differences are inferred to be less that 3% , and are basically below the detection limit .",
    "visible differences between the lines of sight do occur occasionally but are localized and seem to be mostly limited to high column density gas .",
    "strong differences are known to occur from studies of the higher column density metal absorption lines ( papers i and ii ) , but these differences rarely show up in the ly@xmath0 region proper because of saturation .",
    "our results appear broadly consistent with predictions by theuns , mo & schaye ( 2001 ) who model the impact of stellar feedback on the appearance of the ly@xmath0 forest and find that stellar feedback will mostly affect the higher column density , lyman limit absorption systems .",
    "the suggestion ( chen et al 2000 ) that most absorption lines with a rest frame equivalent width @xmath151 ( corresponding to n(hi)@xmath152 cm @xmath85 for a doppler parameter @xmath153kms@xmath3 ) are related to galactic halos ( where we might expect to see hydrodynamic disturbances ) is not contradicted by our results because close to 90% of the ly@xmath0 forest lines above our chosen column density threshold ( @xmath154 cm@xmath85 ) have lower column densities .",
    "our results are consistent with unsaturated ly@xmath0 systems being mostly featureless at the few percent level on scales smaller by an order of magnitude than state - of - the art cosmological hydro - simulations can currently resolve .",
    "apparently , the finite resolution of the simulations does not lead to a significant underestimate of the clumpiness of the baryon distribution , for densities typical of the unsaturated ly@xmath0 forest , i.e. , overdensities up to a factor 10 - 15 .",
    "however , our observations only provide a snapshot of the properties of the ly@xmath0 forest at @xmath155 and can not exclude the existence of earlier non - gravitational processes in the igm if , by the time of observation , their hydrodynamical traces have been obliterated ( see also below ) .",
    "notwithstanding doubts about the applicability of the kolmogorov law to the low density igm , we have tentatively derived the rate of turbulent energy input into the low density igm .",
    "the turbulent energy in the unsaturated low column density ly@xmath0 clouds ( @xmath156 ) appears to be lower by 34 orders of magnitude than that in the stronger , civ absorbing clouds dealt with in paper ii .",
    "apparently , the civ gas has been affected more recently ( and thus more frequently , given it is unlikely that there is a sharply defined `` epoch '' of star formation ) by stellar feedback than the general ly@xmath0 forest .    the fraction of the spectra that differ by more than 5% in optical depth with respect to the other line of sight , considering all saturated regions as being disturbed , was measured for various column density ranges .",
    "the results imply a limit on the relative importance of hydrodynamic disturbances in the presence of the restoring effects of gas pressure . from the upper limit to the line of sight filling factor ( @xmath157 ) we find upper limits to the _ volume _ filling factor and space density of wind - producing galaxies as a function of the mechanical wind luminosity , the density of the ambient igm , and the starting redshift of the wind .",
    "the presence of short lived , weak winds ( low luminosity or high ambient density ) is only poorly constrained .",
    "the other extreme , long - lived superwinds with @xmath148 arising as early as redshift 10 , could fill up to 40% of the volume of the universe by redshift 3.3 , but not more than 18% if starting at redshift 4 .",
    "currently there is no observational evidence for the existence of @xmath158 superwinds , but closer to the epoch of our observations strong outflows have been seen in high redshift galaxies ( franx et al .",
    "1997 ; pettini et al 2001 ) , so there is the possibility that a significant fraction of the volume of the universe may have been stirred by winds ; our results appear to show that it is not a dominant one .",

    "this appendix addresses two questions : ( 1 ) would a superbubble or wind blowing into the igm at high redshift produce detectable hi absorption , and ( 2 ) can we produce limits on the volume filling factor of extragalactic wind bubbles from the fraction of the ly@xmath0 forest spectrum disturbed by such events ?",

    "the actual absorption is likely to be stronger ( the bubble certainly sweeps up material with higher than average density ( @xmath182 at @xmath58 ) in the vicinity of the galaxy from which it originates",
    ".      a dense shell crossing two adjacent lines of sight separated by a distance @xmath23 will produce differences in the column densities as long as the time it takes the shell to traverse the lines of sight is shorter than the sound crossing time @xmath183 ( @xmath184 yr , in the present case ) . from simple geometric arguments , @xmath185 where @xmath124 is the impact parameter of the lines of sight relative to the center of the shell .",
