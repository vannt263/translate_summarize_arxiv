    "in the last years we have computed several sequences of agb models of intermediate mass stars with the purpose to investigate the evolutionary properties and the related nucleosynthesis of these class of objects . in this paper we have collected all these models in order to summarize our main findings . in table 1",
    "we report a list of the computed sequences .",
    "some features of the models are reported too .",
    "let us remind that the models presented here have been obtained with the same version of the franec code used in our previous computation of low mass agb stars ( straniero et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "1 *    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the ten rows in table 1 report respectively : the initial mass ( zams mass ) of each sequence , the initial metallicity , the initial helium , the adopted mass loss rate ( `` no '' means no mass loss , while numbers indicates the value of the @xmath1 parameter in the reimers formula ) , the numbers of computed thermal pulses , the final ( last computed ) mass , the final ( last computed ) carbon over oxygen ratio , the maximum temperature ( in @xmath2 k ) at the base of the convective envelope ( generally it coincides with the one obtained in the last computed interpulse except in the case of the 5 m@xmath3 @xmath4 ) , the maximum temperature ( in @xmath2 k ) at the base of the he convective shell and , finally , the last computed value of the amount of mass ( in @xmath0 ) dredged from the he - core . note that all the sequences ( except the one of the 5 @xmath0 with @xmath5 ) were arbitrarily stopped after about 40 - 50 tps . the case of the 5 @xmath0 with @xmath5 will be discussed below .",
    "at variance with low mass stars , the iii dredge - up ( tdu ) occurs rather early in our thermally pulsing intermediate mass models . for z=0.02 , the first evident episode",
    "is found after the 4th , the 5th and the 7th thermal pulse in the 5 , 6 and 7 @xmath0 respectively , whereas at z=0.001 the 5 @xmath0 experiences a tdu just after 3 tps .",
    "the positions of the h and he burning shells as well as the position of the base of the convective envelope are reported in figure 1 , for the 5 @xmath0 z=0.001 .",
    "we found that the penetration of the convective envelope into the he core decreases when the mass increases ( see the last row in table 1 ) .",
    "in addition the extension ( in mass ) of the region between the two burning shells is lower for the more massive models .",
    "these occurrences are probably due to the connection between the strength of the pulse and the efficiency of the hydrogen burning shell ( hbs ) . in fact",
    "the ignition point of the he burning shell ( hebs ) in the temperature / density plane depends on the h burning rate .",
    "the larger this rate the lower the density and the larger the temperature of the he shell at the moment of the re - ignition .",
    "then , less work must be done by the he burning to expand the lighter layers above it and , in turn , a weaker pulse and a smaller tdu occur . in the last computed pulse of the 5",
    "@xmath0 the 3@xmath6 luminosity peak exceeds @xmath7 @xmath8 , but it drops to @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath8 in the 6 and 7 @xmath0 models , respectively ( see also figure 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the more massive models have a more efficient hbs because of the larger core mass and the deeper penetration of the h rich convective envelope into the burning region ( see next section ) .",
    "we have tested such a connection between h burning efficiency , pulse strength and tdu , by artificially reducing ( or increasing ) the rate of the @xmath11n(p,@xmath12)@xmath13o ) , which is the bottleneck of the cno cycle .",
    "this test confirms our hypothesis and allow us to conclude that any input physics , which could alter the rate of the h burning , have a direct influence on the features of the thermal pulse , in particular its strength and dredge - up .",
    "the evolution of the temperature at the bottom of the convective envelope ( tbce ) for our 7 @xmath0 model of solar chemical composition is reported in figure 4 .",
    "we can see that this temperature rapidly approaches @xmath14 k. similar values were obtained by blcker ( 1995 ) for a 7 @xmath0 and by lattanzio et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for a 6 @xmath0 .",
    "as shown in figure 5 these temperatures are so large that most of the carbon dredged up from the he shell by the tdu is converted into nitrogen during the interpulse .",
    "a similar situation is found for the 6 @xmath0 , although the maximum tbce is slightly lower ( about @xmath15 k ) . however , the @xmath16c(p,@xmath17)@xmath18n reaction is almost inactive at the base of the convective envelope in the 5 @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the maximum tbce never exceeds @xmath19",
    "k.    as already noted by lattanzio et al .",
    "( 1996 ) hbb is strongly limited by mass loss . in the extreme case of the 5 @xmath0 @xmath5 the maximum tbce",
    "does never reach @xmath10 k.    at lower metallicity , the thickness of the hbs is larger and the penetration of the convective envelope into the region of the cno burning is favored by a less steep entropy barrier . in our 5 @xmath0 z=0.001",
    ", we found a bottom temperature as large as @xmath20 k and a significant hbb .",
    "( see figure 6 and 7 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the result of lattanzio & forestini ( 1999 ) .",
    "as firstly found by blcker & schnberner ( 1991 ) in numerical computations of agb stars , the classical core mass / luminosity relation ( paczynski , 1975 , iben & renzini 1983 ) can not apply to stars which experience hbb .",
    "although we found a certain deviation from the classical relation , the luminosity of our more massive models , which are close to @xmath21 ( i.e. the minimum mass for the degenerate carbon ignition ) , never exceeds the observed magnitude of the agb tip ( @xmath22 , see e.g. wood et al .",
    "1992 ) .    in figure 8",
    "we report the luminosity versus the core mass for our model of 7 @xmath0 .",
    "note how the luminosity of these models asymptotically approaches the observed agb limit .",
    "at the time of the tdu , if a certain amount of protons are diffused below the convective envelope into the top layer of the helium / carbon rich region , a tiny @xmath18c pocket forms .",
    "later on , as already found for low mass stars ( straniero et al .",
    "1995 , straniero et al .",
    "1997 , herwig et al .",
    "1997 ) , when the temperature in that pocket rises up to 90 - 100 @xmath2 k , the @xmath18c is fully destroyed by @xmath6 capture during the interpulse .",
    "so neutrons are released and the heavy _",
    "s_-elements production can take place .",
    "in such a case the typical neutron density is of the order of @xmath23 @xmath24 . in our models with @xmath25 @xmath0 ,",
    "a further neutron source operates during the convective thermal pulse .",
    "in fact , as shown in table 1 , the temperature at the base of the he convective shell reaches @xmath26 k. in such condition , the substantial activation of the @xmath27ne(@xmath6,n)@xmath28 mg reaction provides an important contribution to the _ s_-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "this confirms the old prescription of iben ( 1975a , b ) .",
    "the neutron density during the tp is definitely greater than in the case of the @xmath18c burning .",
    "we found @xmath29 @xmath24 .",
    "some details of the nucleosynthesis in intermediate mass stars can be found in vaglio et al .",
    "the search of the physical mechanism responsible for the formation of a planetary nebula is a longstanding problem in modern astrophysics .",
    "this subject is obviously related to the comprehension of the final stage of the agb evolution . in model computations",
    "it is currently assumed that , at a certain point along the agb , mass loss abruptly grows ( up to @xmath30 ) , so that an envelope ejection is simulated ( see e.g. vassiliadis & wood , 1993 ; blcker , 1995 ; forestini & charbonnel , 1997 ) .",
    "however , the correct evaluation of the masses of planetary nebulae and those of their nuclei , as well as the description of the agb termination will depend on the particular parameterization of this superwind regime .    in a recent paper sweigart ( 1998 ) found that in mass losing models the ratio ( @xmath31 ) of the radiation pressure to the gas pressure drops abruptly in a region located just above the h / he discontinuity .",
    "this occurs just after each thermal pulse .",
    "when the envelope mass is reduced enough ( how much is depending on the core mass and metallicity ) , @xmath31 becomes practically 0 and the local stellar luminosity exceeds the eddington luminosity .",
    "then , an instability , which could drive the envelope ejection , settles on .",
    "something similar was also reported by wood & faulkner ( 1986 ) .",
    "we confirm the sweigart s finding . in our 5 @xmath0 @xmath5 the minimum value of @xmath31",
    "is attained during the tdu . at the beginning of the tp - agb phase ,",
    "the value of this minimum is about 0.3 - 0.4 , but it decreases from one pulse to the next as the envelope mass is reduced by the mass loss .",
    "after 23 thermal pulses , when the residual total mass is 2.48 @xmath0 and the core mass is 0.89 @xmath0 , @xmath31 goes to 0 and our hydrostatic code can not go ahead ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "we found the same situation in a 2.5 @xmath0 , z=0.006 and @xmath32 .",
    "in such a case the final ( last computed ) mass is 0.81 @xmath0 and the core mass is 0.67 @xmath0 .",
    "such an occurrence have a quite simple explanation . as a consequence of the thermal pulse , an expansion",
    ", starting from the he shell , propagates toward the surface .",
    "when this expansion reaches the base of h rich envelope , the local temperature decreases below @xmath2 k. then the drop of @xmath31 is determined by the well known bump in the metal opacity around log _ t_=5.3 ( see e.g. iglesias , roger , wilson , 1992 ) . which implies a decrease of the local eddington luminosity .",
    "thus a sort of void forms between the core and the envelope ( see figure 9 ) . in this thin layer",
    "the stellar structure can not react , as usually occurs , to an increase of the local temperature by expanding the gas and reducing the local pressure .",
    "then , any small perturbation will inevitably grow .",
    "we can not say if this instability can indefinitely grow , but we believe that this phenomenon could play a pivotal role in the agb termination .",
    "this problem deserves a further investigation , possibly by means of an hydrodynamic code .",
    "let us finally note that the tdu increases the metal content of the envelope , and , in turn , the opacity bump will increase .",
    "so the larger the dredge - up the deeper the @xmath31 drop is . in the present computations the final c / o ratio in the envelope of the 5 @xmath0 is 0.6 ,",
    "whereas in the case of the 2.5 @xmath0 we obtain a carbon star well before the end of the sequence .",
