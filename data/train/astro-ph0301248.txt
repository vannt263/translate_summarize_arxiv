    "for many years after their introduction as one of the hubble types , elliptical galaxies ( e s ) were generally thought of as  boring dynamical systems `` , that is oblate spheroids supported by rotation .",
    "unduly slow rotations however , were measured in a number of objects ( bertola & capaccioli 1975 ; illingworth 1977 ) . _ the anisotropy of the velocity field was then invoked to explain the flattening of ellipticals_. on the other hand a paper entitled  a numerical model for a triaxial stellar system in dynamical equilibrium '' was published by schwarzschild ( 1979 ) : it aimed at explaining the correlated radial variations in isophotes axis - ratios and orientations .",
    "although these properties had already been well - documented in the sixties , the interest was renewed from both the theoretical and observational points of view ( williams & schwarzschild 1979a , 1979b ; leach 1981 ) .",
    "_ triaxiality became fashionable _ , and it was realized that ellipticals were quite exciting dynamical systems after all !",
    "a few years later , the presence of disks in e s was advocated ( michard 1984 , 1985 ) , on the basis of the ellipticity radial profiles of e s as compared to s0 and the pointed forms of isophotes .",
    "a key result was published by bender ( 1988 ) , who found a correlation between isophotal geometry and kinematics : objects with pointed , or ",
    "disky `` , isophotes are fast rotators and largely supported by rotation . objects with  boxy '' isophotes rotate quite slowly , and can only be supported by  thermal \" motions ,",
    "i.e. a stochastic system of stellar orbits . on average",
    "the fainter objects are disky ( @xmath0e ) , while giant e s are often boxy ( @xmath1e ) . a face - on disk can not be readily detected , but is still present ( rix & white 1990 ) , hence the sub - class @xmath2e .",
    "although most e - galaxies have a disk , this component is only a minor ornament , compared to the powerful rotating disks of spirals : in these galaxies the disks eventually dominates the morphology , photometry and kinematics .",
    "spirals ( s ) have plenty of interstellar matter ( ism ) , including `` cold gas '' ( atomic and molecular ) , dust and are accordingly still able to form new stars .",
    "spirals are supported by rotation , including their central spheroidal bulge , often considered as a small e - galaxy  grafted `` upon the disk . in contrast , ellipticals have little ism and their stars are normally quite old .",
    "they have however the rather unique property to contain significant amounts of  hot gas '' at some @xmath3 k and therefore to emit x - rays .",
    "rotation plays only a minor role in their dynamical support .",
    "finally , radio - galaxies with extended lobes seem to be giant e s : is it a way to recognize these at large @xmath4 ?    of special interest are the lenticulars or s0 galaxies , intermediate between spirals and ellipticals : they have disks of various importance , between those of e and s objects , and are largely supported by rotation .",
    "no spiral structure appears but bar instability is current . on the other hand",
    "their stellar populations resemble those of ellipticals , while their amount of ism varies very much from one object to the other : eventually as low as for e s , it may become quite noticeable , without allowing star formation .",
    "it is a challenge for astrophysicists to understand the origin and evolution of all these three major types of bright galaxies ( not counting the various classes of dwarfs which will not be discussed in this review ) . among the usual constraints are the relative populations of e / s0/s as a function of @xmath4 and in various environments , i.e. the field , small groups and clusters of diverse richness .",
    "we are nevertheless justified in considering separately the problem of ellipticals , because of a number of systematic properties , in their photometry and kinematics , or in their stellar population content .",
    "these supply adequate guidance in deriving theoretical models , and precious tests of their success .",
    "the origin of cosmic structures , including galaxies of all types , is currently described through the gravitational dissipationless collapse in a universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) , with a suitable mix of primeval gas and photons .",
    "the existence of large amounts of dissipationless dm in the universe , clustered hierarchically as numerical simulations indicate , may induce the infall of gas into the potential wells of pre - existing halos and form the `` luminous '' galaxies . note that the presently popular version of the cdm scenario , i.e. the @xmath5cdm ( bahcall et al . 1999 ) agrees with observations , such as the residual fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) or the distribution of galaxy clusters and superclusters .",
    "it is of course unfortunate that the physical nature of cdm remains unknown , while the presence of dm halos around galaxies is still questioned from time to time , even for spirals which seemed to present the most robust dynamical proofs .",
    "starting from preexisting dm halos ( or protogalaxies ) it is possible to model the formation of galaxies , using simulations which take into account the dynamics of dm and gas , star formation , radiative cooling and gas loss from galactic winds .",
    "two main families of models may be recognized :    1 .",
    "the _ monolithic scenario _ , developed since the early work by larson ( 1975 ) , is characterized by an important star formation activity and a consequent chemical enrichment /em at very early phases of the galaxy history , followed by a long period of quiescent evolution .",
    "episodes of star formation may occur later in the lifetime of the galaxy , stimulated by gas accreted from the surrounding ambient or by interactions with neighbors ( bertola et al .",
    "2 .   in the so called _ hierarchical scenario _",
    ", ellipticals are formed from different merging episodes through the hubble time , which trigger the star formation activity and the chemical enrichment of the system ( white & rees 1978 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "massive ellipticals form at relatively low redshifts ( @xmath6 ) through the merging of spiral galaxies ( toomre 1977 ; baugh et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .    as emphasized by peebles ( 2002 ) ,",
    "the distinction between the two scenarios is more of historical than physical significance .",
    "large objects may be formed by interaction and merging of a hierarchy of primeval `` lumps '' in a protogalaxy : this is practically equivalent to a monolithic scenario . on the other hand",
    ", there is no doubt that galaxies do interact , with sometimes spectacular effects , and have perhaps interacted still more at large z. the central problem is rather to find out when the bulk of the stars were formed and if this population evolved passively , or was modified , and to what extent , by interactions .",
    "another important problem is the morphology : were e s formed with their present form , symmetry and lack of fast rotation ( at least in the bright baryon dominated region ) , or did successive mergers transfer outwards the angular momentum of merging disks ? other relevant questions may result from the consideration of central super massive black holes ( smbh ) , now believed to be present in all stellar spheroids , and this from the `` old days '' of peak quasar activity .",
    "the necessary constraints , or part of these , are given by the recognition of e s at larger and larger @xmath4 and their statistics in comparison with other hubble types ( if traceable ) .",
    "if formed at relatively low redshifts ( say @xmath6 ) , following a succession of mergers , e s should be rare or absent at distinctly larger @xmath4 values .",
    "in contrast , the  monolithic scenario predicts that massive ellipticals , completed at @xmath7 after a brief and intense star formation period , are evolving passively , implying a constant comoving number density .",
    "a large body of observations show that ellipticals were already formed at @xmath8 in about the same proportion as today , and have since then evolved passively .",
    "this results from studies of the fundamental plane , of the @xmath4 evolution of the color - luminosity relation or the mg@xmath9 relation .",
    "only minor events of  recent \" stellar formation are allowed for perhaps 20% of e s , but less in rich clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "the oldest known galaxy is at @xmath10 ( hu et al . , 2002 ) , and a few have been discovered at @xmath11 .",
    "quasars are known at similar @xmath4 .",
    "this leaves a large gap of @xmath4 space to explore , for further progresses in the evolution of galaxies , including e s .",
    "in section 2 we review recent photometric and spectroscopic data leading to an improved picture of the rather complex dynamical structure of ellipticals .",
    "we present briefly the 3d observations from integral field spectrographs which are expected to bring major progresses when fully analyzed .",
    "we discuss the scaling relations such as the size - luminosity ( or kormendy s ) relation and the fundamental plane , the color - luminosity or the mg@xmath9 relations , which all have important impacts upon the problems of the evolution of e s .",
    "the empirical evidence for smbh is also presented in this section .    section 3 introduces the evidence for the presence of dark matter halos around ellipticals , and then summarizes the cdm theory of the formation of cosmic structures , including protogalactic halos , leading to the birth of galaxies through gas concentration , stellar formation and feed - back to the gas from massive stars evolution .",
    "gas dynamics and galaxy formation are discussed in section 4 .    in section 5 , we discuss different population synthesis models ( single - burst and evolutionary models ) used to interpret the integrated properties of stellar populations , and to derive mean metallicities and ages at different redshifts , thus testing the formation and evolutionary scenarios of e s , with the help of the precious clock , namely , the [ mg / fe ] ratio , provided by the theory of stellar evolution .",
    "finally , in section 6 we will summarize the relevant observational and theoretical aspects concerning elliptical galaxies discussed in the present paper .",
    "the essential parameters describing a galaxy are its mass m , its total luminosity l and a suitably defined  radius `` @xmath12 .",
    "natural '' definition of @xmath12 is the so - called _ effective radius , or de vaucouleurs radius _ , defined from the two axis @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the ( nearly elliptical ) isophote encircling half the total light as @xmath15 .",
    "a related quantity of interest is the average surface brightness @xmath16 within the effective radius .",
    "the total magnitudes @xmath17 , in one or the other of the usual pass - bands , are substitute to the luminosity .",
    "photometric measurements need to be corrected for extinction by the interstellar milky way material .",
    "the corrections have long been derived from the hi line optical depth .",
    "new dust extinction maps have recently been produced from far ir satellite data ( schlegel et al . 1998 ) .",
    "so - called k - corrections are needed to take care of the changes of the filter pass - band in the rest spectrum of the red - shifted objects .",
    "cosmological corrections have to be introduced in the study of distant galaxies , beginning with @xmath16 which decreases as @xmath18 .",
    "for the so - called giant and intermediate ellipticals treated here , orders of magnitude are -22.8 to -18.6 for @xmath17 in b light , 25 to 1.5 kpc for @xmath12 , @xmath19",
    "l@xmath20 to @xmath21 l@xmath20 for l ( in b light ) and @xmath22 to @xmath23 m@xmath20 for m.    distances are needed for the physical interpretation of photometric data .",
    "clusters provide precious collections of galaxies at the same distance . in recent years",
    "tremendous progresses have been made in the evaluation of the distances of e s , with the fundamental plane ( see section 2.6 ) and the technique of surface brightness fluctuations ( tonry & schneider , 1988 ; tonry et al . ,",
    "the results of both method are compared by blakeslee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "it has long been known that the essential global photometric parameters , i.e. @xmath17 and @xmath12 ( or @xmath24 ) are intercorrelated ( kormendy 1977 ; michard 1979 ) , suggesting some standard design of these systems .",
    "the name of  kormendy relation \" recently appeared in the literature .",
    "this question has been revisited by capaccioli et al .",
    "these statistics clearly indicate that dwarf ellipticals ( de ) are not structurally similar to normal e.    the study of the radial surface - brightness profiles of e - galaxies is of great interest for a discussion of their evolution , because it shows rather surprising regularities , which have been known for half a century ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) .",
    "the isophotal surface - brightness @xmath25 ( in magnitude ) follows closely the law @xmath26 $ ] , called de vaucouleurs law , and this in a large range of @xmath27 , more than 10 magnitudes according to de vaucouleurs & capaccioli ( 1979 ) .",
    "a substitute to the de vaucouleurs law , but of straightforward theoretical significance , has been given by hernquist ( 1990 ) .",
    "systematic deviations from the de vaucouleurs law have been noted .",
    "kormendy ( 1977 ) introduced the concept of  tidal halos `` around large ellipticals with close neighbors , a paradoxical feature of brightest cluster members ( or cd galaxies ) .",
    "it has been also known that giant ellipticals often have an enhanced envelope above the @xmath28 law valid for their inner regions .",
    "small ellipticals , seemingly satellites to much larger neighbors , show @xmath27 profiles  truncated '' outwards below the law valid for their inner regions .",
    "altogether the deviations from the de vaucouleurs law correlate with luminosities .",
    "these deviations have prompted a search for other representations of the @xmath27 profiles .",
    "a review is due to cappaccioli ( 1988 ) .",
    "systematic deviations from the @xmath28 law may be lessened by replacing the @xmath29 exponent by @xmath30 ( srsic 1968 ) with @xmath31 between 1 ( exponential profile ) and up to 10 or more .",
    "applications of srsic s formula can be found in caon et al .",
    "as expected , the residuals are strongly reduced by adding one more free parameter in the fit !",
    "there is some correlation between the optimal @xmath30 values and the luminosity of the galaxies .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath28 law is a remarkable property of _ bona fide _ ellipticals , but one can not expect these products of nature to comply rigidly with the rule !",
    "systematic deviations exist , function of the luminosity .",
    "local perturbations may result from the presence of embedded disks in the dominant @xmath28 spheroid .",
    "a variety of @xmath27 profiles are presented in figure 3 .",
    "they have been obtained by merging hst ( high resolution ) and ground based ( low resolution ) data . since the chosen abscissae scale is @xmath32 , where @xmath12 is the measured de vaucouleurs radius , the graphs for various galaxies following the @xmath28 law would be parallel straight lines .",
    "one can appreciate from figure 3 the robustness of this law and the importance of the deviations from it .",
    "these are particularly noticeable towards the center ( see below ) .",
    "nieto et al . ( 1991 ) already proposed to sort out e s into two subclasses according to their central photometric profiles : one group has relatively flat and broad _ cores _",
    ", easily resolved from high resolution ground based observations .",
    "the other displays sharp peaked profiles , remaining unresolved under the same conditions . in the first group one finds _",
    "bright objects _ of the @xmath1e class ( or @xmath2e ) while the second contains the fainter @xmath0e objects , plus a variety of _ not bright _ @xmath1e .",
    "these findings have been amply confirmed by the hst observations , already in its post - launching state ( jaffe et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al . 1995 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 ) , and later after installation of the correcting system ( carollo et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b , rest et al .",
    "the terminology of  core - like `` and  power - law '' profiles respectively are adopted here from lauer et al .",
    "the hst profiles have been described by an ad hoc analytical law (  nuker law \" ) with no less than 5 parameters ( byun et al .",
    "they have been de - projected to give the corresponding density profiles : the distinction between the two types is emphasized by the de - projection ( gebhardt et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in figure 3 ,",
    "the two classes of central profiles are documented in the @xmath32 systems of abscissae .",
    "the differences are striking : the  power - law `` profiles are cusped above the @xmath28 law , while the  core - like '' profiles present a truncated @xmath28 law .    the correlations between the two classes of nuclei and other galaxies properties ( i.e. luminosity , disky / boxyness and rotation velocity ) and their origins are discussed by faber et al .",
    "most explanations of the two kind of profiles invoke central black - holes ( see sect .",
    "silva & wise ( 1996 ) proposed however , that core - like nuclei could be  flattened \" by a central concentration of dust .",
    "this should produce a strong maximum of reddening , which is not present ( carollo et al .",
    "1997a ; michard 1998c ) .",
    "it is rather the power - law nuclei which show a central red peak , of uncertain origin : dust concentration , or sharp metallicity increases or both .",
    "another interesting feature disclosed by hst images is the presence of an unresolved spike at the center of the",
    " flat \" cores of several ( but not all ! ) giant e s ( forbes et al .",
    "1995 ; bower et al . 1997 ; bower 1999 ) .",
    "an important review paper on the  kinematical properties of early - type galaxies \" is available ( capaccioli & longo 1994 ) , giving precious details about the relations between the observable quantities and the actual kinematics of complex unresolved stellar systems , and also discussing the methods of data analysis .",
    "the emergent spectrum is the sum of the spectra of the stars along the line - of - sight : it may be approximated by the convolution of the spectrum of a star(s ) , so selected as to represent the dominant population ( in terms of light output ) , by the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) .",
    "the problem is then to recover the losvd and to compare it with the one of suitable physical models of galaxy structure and dynamics .    representing the losvd by a gaussian , one obtains its width , interpreted as a  velocity dispersion \" @xmath33 , and its position in wavelength , which results from the line - of - sight velocity of the galaxy as a whole , plus local velocities , eventually consistent with a rotation @xmath34 of the object .",
    "recently , the representation of the losvd by more than two parameters became feasible for observations of improved s / n ratio : two gauss - hermite functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 of order 3 and 4 are added to the gaussian ( van der marel & franx 1993 ; bender et al .",
    "the term in @xmath35 describes an asymmetry of the losvd , expected for instance if two components with different velocities are superposed along the line - of - sight .",
    "the term in @xmath36 sharpens or flattens the losvd against the gaussian .",
    "their comparison with the calculated parameters from dynamical models reinforce significantly the observational constraints on the theory of galaxy structures .",
    "classical results may be summarized as follows :    \\a ) the central velocity dispersions of e s are rather well correlated with their luminosity : this is the faber - jackson relation which provided the first reliable estimator of the luminosities and distances of these objects ( faber & jackson 1976 ) .",
    "it is now superseded by the fundamental plane ( see sect , 2.6 ) , of which it is a projection .",
    "the central values of @xmath33 are often used as substitute for the mass of e s .",
    "\\b ) again rotations are know for many e classified objects although much less than for the @xmath33 parameter .",
    "when extending in a large enough range of @xmath37 , the rotation velocities reach a plateau , and ",
    "flat \" circular velocities may be derived ( kronawitter et al .",

    "2001 ) .",
    "following binney ( 1978 ) , the kinematics of a galaxy is roughly described by the anisotropy parameter @xmath39 .",
    "there @xmath40 is the mean velocity dispersion within @xmath41 and @xmath42 the mean ellipticity .",
    "this gives the ratio @xmath43 normalized to its value for an oblate spheroid of ellipticity @xmath42 supported by rotation .",
    "the striking correlations of @xmath44 with the morphological subclass , i.e. @xmath0e , @xmath1e , @xmath2e , are described by bender ( 1992 ) or in the review by de zeeuw & franx ( 1991 ) .",

    "\\a ) minor axis rotation    after the discovery in the seventies of the surprisingly slow rotation of several ellipticals , the eighties brought two developments who made ever more  exciting \" the kinematics , hence the dynamics , of such objects .",
    "the first was the detection of a large rotational velocity along the _ minor axis _ of ngc4261 ( franx & illingworth 1988 ; davies & birkinshaw 1988 ) , instead of the usual major axis rotation of disks or oblate spheroids .",
    "other cases of kinematical misalignments were soon found and interpreted as a sure evidence of triaxiality of the systems .",
    "a discussion of the then available data is due to franx et al .",
    "the misalignment angle @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the apparent velocities along the two axis .",
    "it is generally near zero , as for an oblate spheroid , but cases with large @xmath46 values are not infrequent , exclusively among @xmath1e or similar @xmath2e objects ( see sauron data in copin et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "\\b ) kinematically decoupled cores    the second surprise was the finding of  kinematically decoupled cores \" ( kdc ) ( illingworth & franx 1988 ) .",
    "these are small components , near the galaxy center , which do not share the apparent rotation of its main body .",
    "they are considered as resulting from the accretion of a minor outside galaxy .",
    "a remarkable example is ngc4365 , a favored target to several observers .",

    "the study of e s does not afford opportunities to estimate in a compelling way the densities of their mdos .",

    "a beautiful summary of the relations of these domains of research is in richstone et al .",
    "the following essential conclusions are quoted from this paper : 1 ) smbhs are a normal feature of the central regions of bright galaxies , particularly those with spheroids .",
    "2 ) their masses scale in rough proportion to host - galaxy spheroid mass .",
    "3 ) the total mass density in smbh is broadly consistent with the mass - equivalent energy density in the quasar light background .",
    "the association of smbhs and spheroidal stellar systems suggests parent formation processes , probably in dense regions which collapsed early .",
    "on the other hand the  broad consistency `` in global energetics strongly suggests that present day smbhs are indeed relics of the powerful agns of the  quasar era '' around @xmath63 to 3 .",
    "there remain discrepancies with the numbers however , the number of relics being too large compared to the number of parent quasars , possibly because statistics of ancient quasars select the brightest , while the statistics of the actual smbh select those close to our terrestrial observatories . according to the quoted authors ,",
    "one way out of these difficulties is to assume a progressive  fattening \" of black holes during and after the quasar era , so that many minor ancient agns were too faint to enter our quasar catalogues .",
    "the discovery of smbh candidates in many spheroidal galaxies may further complicate the problem of the origin and evolution of these objects . on the other hand it offers a way to explain the nuclear profiles ,  core `` against  power - law '' , described above .",
    "van der marel ( 1999 ) shows that these various profiles may result from the adiabatic growth of black holes into pre - existing isothermal cores , following a scenario first analyzed by young ( 1980 ) .",
    "this simple scenario is criticized by merritt ( 1998 ) on theoretical grounds : he notes that the isothermal core is not favored by the theories of galaxy formation , either through hierarchical clustering or collapse .",
    "the end products of these processes are adequate nests to grow a black hole and develop a steep power - law nucleus ( quinlan et al .",
    "1995 , merritt & quinlan 1998 ) .",
    "for the much less abrupt core - like profiles of giant ellipticals , the coalescence of two smbhs following a merger of their host galaxies ( ebisuzaki et al .",

    "1997 ) .",
    "since the luminosity was known to be correlated with @xmath16 and with @xmath64 ( faber - jackson relation ) , it is not surprising that a better correlation was found by using both observables simultaneously .",
    "the bivariate relation may be written as @xmath65 or @xmath66 expressing the radius or luminosity in terms of observables .",
    "similar relations have been published simultaneously by dressler et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and djorgovski & davis ( 1987 ) .",
    "any one of these two relations define the so - called fundamental plane ( fp ) of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the fp theoretical basis is obtained from the virial theorem which gives m@xmath67 , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 are suitable definitions of the radius and mean internal velocity , and g the constant of gravitation .",

    "note that the exponents in these equations can be expressed in terms of the slope @xmath52 . as the m / l ratio varies with the colour",
    ", these exponents also vary .",
    "the value of the two - parameter relation , and the justification for the use of such a majestic vocable as fundamental plane , is the high quality of the fit : this might slightly be improved , by taking into account the role of rotation in the theoretical or empirical derivation of the fp ( prugniel & simien , 1994 ; bender et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "as it is , the fp has many applications and physical interpretations .",
    "thus it offers the possibility to estimate the distances of e s with an accuracy of about 15% . for this particular application , it is often replaced by the @xmath73-@xmath74 relation ( dressler et al .",

    "the quality of the fp relation implies that the m / l ratio of e s has only a smooth variation with l. on the other hand , the structure parameter @xmath71 in eq .",
    "3 should be nearly constant .",
    "these questions have been studied first by consideration of the fp in the near ir ( pahre et al .",
    "1995 , 1998a ) and later by comparisons of the fp from the u ( 0.35 @xmath75 m ) to the k ( 2.2 @xmath75 m ) spectral bands ( pahre et al .",

    "the effects of stellar populations explain only half of the apparent variations of m / l , i. e. the exponent @xmath52 above .",
    "the rest of the tilt of the fp should be explained by some dependence of the rotational support and of the spatial structure on the luminosity .",
    "the authors  conclude to a constancy of the dynamical - to - stellar mass ratio \" .",
    "various attempts have been made to find eventual differences in the fp for galaxies in different environments : poor clusters such as virgo and rich clusters such as coma ; central core and outskirts of coma ( lucey et al . 1991 ) ; field and cluster ellipticals ( de carvalho & djorgovsky 1992 ) ; cluster to cluster differences ( j@xmath76rgensen et al .",

    "the discrepancy between theory and simulation can be due to the assumption that objects collapse spherically in the press - schechter theory .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that this discrepancy reduces substantially if bound structures are assumed to form from an ellipsoidal , rather than a spherical , collapse ( sheth et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it is generally believed that galaxy rotation curves depends on the density profile of dark matter halos .",
    "analytic evaluation of the halo density profile goes back to the work of gott ( 1975 ) and gunn ( 1977 ) who established that gravitational collapse could lead to the formation of virialized systems with almost isothermal density profile ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "their work was based on the assumption that halos form by accretion or secondary infall of matter onto an initially overdense perturbation .",
    "if infall produces density profile as shallow as @xmath130 , then the flat rotation curves of disk galaxies and the related observation of increasing @xmath86 on large scales might thereby be explained .",
    "a somewhat steeper @xmath131 profile resulting from infall also explain the hubble law light profile of elliptical galaxies ( gott 1975 ) .",
    "further refinement was made ( bertschinger 1985 ) and it was shown analytically that the secondary infall approaches a self - similar form , whose exact behavior depends on the central boundary conditions and on the kind of gas ; if there is no central black hole , the form proposed by gott & gunn prevails , otherwise the density profile has the power - law form @xmath132 .    that the halo profile should vary from one cosmological model to another was proposed later on ( hoffman & shaham 1985 ) .",
    "approximately flat circular velocities were then obtained for @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( where @xmath31 is the spectral index , see section above expression ( 12 ) .",
    "this provided a strong support for the then fashionable cdm model where at the galactic scale the index of the power - spectrum was @xmath135 ( blumenthal et al .",
    "it therefore became customary to model virialized halos by isothermal spheres characterized by two parameters ; a velocity dispersion and a core radius . later on , in a high resolution simulation of a galaxy - sized cdm halo , surprisingly , it was found that the density profile could be singular even at very small scales ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ) and well - approximated by the model proposed for the elliptical galaxies ( hernquist 1990 ) for which @xmath136 in the inner parts , down to the smallest resolved scale , @xmath137 kpc .",
    "further on , it was shown ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) that the spherically - averaged equilibrium density profiles of cdm halos of all masses can be fitted by the formula ( r)=_s",
    "( r / r_s)^(1+r / r_s)^3- [ nfw ] where is this case @xmath138 , @xmath139 is a scale radius where the profile changes shape and @xmath140 is a characteristic density . although , this profile was originally found for a standard cdm model , it turned out that ( 14 ) provides an excellent fit to halo density profile from other cosmological models ( cole & lacey 1996 ) .",
    "expression ( 14 ) is now assumed to be a universal two - parameter function describing the profile of dark matter halos which is independent of the halo mass , redshift , the initial density fluctuation spectrum and the values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore , at small radii , the results of numerical simulations indicate that the density profile ( 14 ) might be cuspy without the presence of a central core .",
    "although an isothermal profile at large radii agrees with the galaxy rotation curves , there are controversies as whether a cuspy profile near the centre is in accordance with various observations such as the rotation - curve of well - studied gas - rich dwarf spirals ( flores & primack 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , it has been argued that the radial arcs , require a flat core in the cluster density profile , in apparent contradiction with a singular density profile ( mellier et al .",
    "subsequent independent higher - resolution simulations ( fukushige & makino 1997 ; moore et al .",
    "1998 ) have confirmed the presence of a central cusp , but a shallower density profile ( @xmath141 ) has been obtained at small radii which might resolve some of the aforementioned problems .",
    "galaxy formation is a complex process in which not only gravity , discussed in the previous sections , but also gas dynamics , chemistry and turbulence play crucial rles . we still do not have a clear understanding of galaxy formation and the reason for this predicament is that we do not yet have a fundamental theory of star formation .",
    "most theoretical studies in this field are based on phenomenological arguments and numerical simulations . among the different processes involved in galaxy formation are those responsible for heat balance of the gas : shock heating and radiative cooling within collapsing dark matter halos , the subsequent transformation of cold gas into stars and the regulation of star formation by feedback from stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "application of cdm theory at the galaxy scale is rather difficult and most results are based on numerical studies which are mainly either direct simulations or semi - analytic modelings of galaxy formation . in the first approach the gravitational and hydrodynamical equations are solved explicitly using various types of numerical codes ( _ e.g. _  katz et al .",
    "1992 ) . in the second approach",
    ", the evolution of baryonic gas is calculated using simple analytic models while the evolution of dark matter is evaluated using numerical n - body simulations ( white & frenk 1991 ) or a monte carlo techniques in which one studies the merger tree of dark matter halos ( cole et al . 1994 ) .      during the collapse of a dark matter halo ,",
    "the baryonic gas is supposed to be shock - heated , or undergo adiabatic compression depending on the halo mass , to the virial temperature @xmath142 of the host halo , given by t_gas=25gmm_hk r_vir where @xmath113 is the total mass contained inside the virial radius @xmath143 which is usually taken to be half of the initial turn - around radius , @xmath75 is the molecular mass and @xmath144 is the mass of hydrogen atom .",
    "typically @xmath145 , where @xmath146 and @xmath147 .    to form stars the gas has to cool .",
    "the characteristic cooling time , defined as the ratio of the thermal energy density to the cooling rate per unit volume @xmath148 , is _",
    "cool= 32m_hkt_gas _ gas ( t_gas , z_gas ) where @xmath149 is the density of the gas , @xmath150 is the metallicity and @xmath151 is the cooling function , normally taken from tabulated values ( _ e.g. _  sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "a second constraint on star formation is imposed by the dynamical time , @xmath152 which has to be longer than the characteristic cooling time . if we suppose that the gas has a primordial chemical composition , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath153 , then the cooling process is essentially due to bremsstrahlung and the cooling function is proportional to @xmath154 . in this case , equating both timescales one obtains a critical density @xmath155 which for the above example gives a temperature of @xmath156 or @xmath157 g",
    ".    if we assume , in a first approximation , that baryon distribution follows the dark matter distribution , then @xmath159 which gives a critical baryon mass of m_crit^b=43_crit r_dm^3 ~610 ^ 9 m_corresponding to a dynamical time of @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the hubble constant .",
    "thus , only fragments heavier than the above mass can cool fast enough to fragment and form stars during gravitational collapse .",
    "star formation converts gas into luminous matter and at the same time affects the physical state of surrounding gas , since supernova explosion and young stars inject energy and metals out of the galactic disc in the form of a hot wind .",
    "the latter acts as a feedback process which regulates the star formation rate . in addition , the injected metals enrichen both the cold star - forming gas and the surrounding diffuse hot halo gas .",
    "thus , the later evolution of galaxies depends strongly on when the first stars form because they can reionize the intergalactic medium ( at @xmath162 ) and enrichen it with metals , affecting the cooling - heating balance .",
    "metals increase the cooling efficiency , decreasing the gas cooling time and increasing the star formation rate . in the hierarchical approach ,",
    "small objects form first and , if constituted only of primordial material , the cooling timescale may be longer than the hubble timescale , being one of the problems in this scenario .",
    "apart from the clear difference in their stellar populations , the other difference between spiral disks and ellipsoids is that the former are supported against gravity by rotation , whereas for the latter it is primarily the _ pressure _ of the anisotropic stellar orbits that is responsible .",
    "the significance of rotation may be quantified by a dimensionless _ spin parameter _ which is the ratio between the observed angular velocity and the angular velocity which would be required to support the galaxy by rotation alone : = je^1/2 g m^5/2 where @xmath163 is the binding energy and @xmath164 is the angular momentum .",
    "the spin parameter can be as high as @xmath165 for spirals and only @xmath166 for ellipticals .",
    "a physical explanation of these values remains a major unresolved problem .",
    "recent n - body simulations show that in the absence of star formation , protogalactic gas loses much of its angular momentum as it cools into pregalactic fragments that subsequently merge , producing disks that rotate much too slowly ( navarro et al . 1995 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) which is a difficulty concerning the possible formation of s0 s and e s from the merger of spirals .    a possible but poorly - understood solution is feedback , briefly discussed previously , which can prevent the gas from cooling into dense fragments .",
    "furthermore , the kelvin circulation theorem guarantees that in the absence of dissipation , an initially irrotational velocity field remains irrotational .",
    "earlier on we have seen that on large scales motions of self - gravitating particles are in the form of a potential - flow which has zero vorticity .",
    "a possible origin for the rotation of galaxies was suggested , for the first time , by hoyle ( hoyle 1949 ) . in his model",
    "the acquisition of angular momentum is attributed to the tidal action of protogalactic objects around it , at the epoch when the protogalaxy is just about to form a galaxy .",
    "one assumes that the initial density field consists of non - spherical lumps with mass @xmath113 and density contrast @xmath167 .",
    "the total torque , @xmath168 , produced on a clumps , which is roughly taken as a dipole , from another one at a distance of @xmath68 is @xmath169 where as before @xmath13 is the scale factor . in the linear regime @xmath170 and",
    "hence the torque remains constant and the angular momentum grows linearly with time ( @xmath171 ) . to obtain the binding energy once again",
    "we invoke our simple spherical model .",
    "we know the density contrast at the time of collapse is @xmath172 .",
    "since the mass of the object is @xmath173 , this gives the proper radius of the object at turn around in terms of which the binding energy can be written @xmath174 .",
    "let us assume that the object has an overdensity @xmath110 then we obtain for the dimensionless spin parameter ~_c40~0.04 which is in very good agreement with that of ellipticals but is too low to account for the angular momentum spiral galaxies .",
    "but how can one account such morphological segregation ?",
    "a possible explanation is that ellipticals formed earlier when the universe was denser and angular momentum smaller .",
    "an alternative explanation frequently used in cdm hierarchical scenario , is that spirals formed first and ellipticals formed from mergings of the spirals .",
    "this might seem to be plausible given that ellipticals are usually observed in the dense regions , but as we shall see later , there are severe observational evidences disfavoring this picture .",
    "it is worth commenting that dissipative effects , neglected in the tidal picture , might be important factors in the explanation of the origin of the angular momentum and its morphological dependence .",
    "however , dissipative mechanisms are complex processes and so far rather poorly understood .",
    "although , angular momentum is approximately conserved during baryon infall and disk accretion , the numerical simulations ( with cdm model ) show that most of the angular momentum is actually lost to the dark matter halo .",
    "the clumpiness ( existence of substructure ) induces strong angular momentum transfer via tidal torquing and dynamical friction from the dissipating baryons to energy - conserving collisionless dark matter .",
    "the resulting disk therefore has very little specific angular momentum ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) .",
    "a possible solution is feedback by supernova explosion which would inject angular momentum into infalling baryons , which however , leads to significant delay in the formation of disks .",
    "we have already discussed that during their evolution dark matter halos merge and form larger halos with masses which can host the galaxies .",
    "however , there is a second important merger event and that is the merger of the galaxies themselves . in hierarchical models of galaxy formation",
    ", it is normally assumed that when dark matter halos merge , the most massive galaxy automatically becomes the central galaxy in the new halo while the other galaxies become satellite galaxies orbiting within dark matter halo .",
    "the orbits of these satellite galaxies will gradually decay as energy and angular momentum are lost via dynamical friction to halo material .",
    "thus eventually the satellite galaxies will spiral in and merge with the central galaxy .    in these models ,",
    "the galaxy morphologies are ascribed to the particular merger history and accretion events that galaxies experience during their assembly in the universe . in this model ,",
    "disks are envisioned to form as the result of gas accreted smoothly from the intergalactic medium ( katz & gunn 1991 ) whereas the primary route by which elliptical galaxies and the bulge components of spiral galaxies form is through major merger events where disks are thrown together and mixed violently on a short timescale ( toomre 1977 ) .",
    "some numerical n - body simulations have shown that merger of galaxies of comparable masses ( major mergers ) result in the formation of elliptical galaxies ( barnes 1988 ) .",
    "we comment that one can have a monolithic scenario of galaxy formation which accommodates the merger of halos but not that of the galaxies . for this",
    ", collisions between halos must not be head - on and the dynamical friction timescale between baryonic and dark matter should be larger than hubble time .",
    "the epoch of formation of a galaxy is usually defined as the redshift by when more than half of its present mass had been assembled within a sphere of radius @xmath175 kpc .    as we have mentioned earlier ,",
    "the main competing beliefs for the epoch of galaxy formation are monolithic ( high - redshift formation time ) and hierarchical ( low - redshift formation time ) .",
    "the simplest possibility for star formation epoch is that the baryonic gas turned into star at the very early stage of the collapse of dark matter .",
    "there would then be no segregation between stars and dark matter , since stars would behave as collisionless particles .",
    "it was then argued that metal - poor stars in the solar neighborhood have very eccentric orbits and hence must have formed in a time short compared to the collapse time , such that their orbits mixed collisionlessly ( eggen et al .",
    "this is one simple description of the monolithic scenario .",
    "application of cdm theory at the galaxy scale is rather difficult and most results are based on numerical studies which are mainly either direct simulations or semi - analytic modelings of galaxy formation . in the first approach the gravitational and hydrodynamical equations are solved explicitly using various types of numerical codes ( _ e.g. _  katz et al .",

    "a tight upper - bound on the formation redshift of galaxies can be obtained by using again our simple spherical model for a protogalaxy of radius @xmath37 .",
    "a protogalaxy can only be formed when its mean average density , @xmath90 , is higher than the mean background density @xmath176 .",
    "dynamical relaxation after formation increases the internal energy of the stars in the protogalaxy .",
    "thus a reasonable bound on the circular velocity , @xmath177 , ( in the case of a disk system ) or on the dispersion velocity , @xmath78 , ( in the case of a ellipsoidal system ) is the present value for the bright galaxies . using @xmath178",
    ", we get the ratio = 2 v_c^2 _",
    "m(h_0 r)^2(1+z_f)^3 which has to be larger than unity at the formation time . for a spherical model",
    "this ratio can be estimated easily .",
    "the proper radius @xmath179 of the spherical shell containing mass @xmath113 has the parametric form ( peebles 1980 ) r(t)=a(1-cos);t = b(-sin ) where @xmath180 .",
    "the spherical shell initially expands with the background while decelerating more due to its higher density , until it reaches the maximum radius at @xmath181 and turns around and collapses . in einstein de - sitter universe",
    "the background density falls as @xmath182 , and hence at the time of maximum expansion the ratio = 9 ^ 216=5.6 is obtained . equating this ratio with ( 20 ) and for a circular ( dispersion ) velocity of @xmath183 and @xmath184 kpc we obtain z10_m ^-1/3 .",
    "thus , for @xmath185 universe , bright spheroids of galaxies could be in place at redshift of about @xmath186 .",
    "thus , arguments such as above admit the possibility that galaxy formation could occur relatively early at redshifts up to @xmath187 .",
    "however , in cdm models galaxies are expected to form at redshifts much lower than this .",
    "one reason for this is that the clustering pattern of galaxies , as measured by two - point correlation evolves rapidly with time in einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "if galaxies were to form at @xmath188 then one would expect a drastic steepening of the slope of the correlation function which is incompatible with observations .",
    "an important point should be emphasized : the interpretation of the integrated colors or line indices of complex stellar populations , requires necessarily the use of models .",
    "two main `` schools '' have been practicing this exercise in the past years : the first use single stellar population ( ssp ) models , the second evolutionary models .",
    "ssp models are straightforward applications of the theory of stellar evolution . given an initial mass function ( imf ) and chemical composition , the theory allows to calculate the time evolution of such a population and the corresponding spectral properties are obtained from the available stellar  library \" ( theoretical or empirical ) .",
    "the uncertainties in such models were discussed by charlot et al .",
    "the comparison with the observed indices ( color or lines ) give constraints on the input parameters ( age and metallicity in the simplest case ) .",

    "the population mix is calculated , as a function of time , by summing the ssp models representative of successive stellar generations : these are controlled by the amount of residual gas available for star formation , while their chemical composition results from the progressive enrichment of the ism in  metals \" by gas loss from stars , notably supernovae .",

    "( 2000b ) models are fitted , through an iterative procedure , to the color - magnitude diagram ( u - v ) versus @xmath190 of ellipticals in the coma and virgo clusters .",
    "the required star formation efficiency should then be an increasing function of the galactic mass , and the slope of the imf should be slightly flatter in brighter objects .    with the advent of fast computers and powerful simulation techniques ,",
    "there has been considerable progress in describing the growth of structures and in reproducing some of the basic properties of galaxies and their evolution . in the case of e s ,",
    "codes including smooth particle hydrodynamics and n - body tree , have been used to explore whether the formation of e - galaxies inside non - rotating virialized dm halos leads to results compatible with actual data .",
    "models along these lines , including heating and cooling ( see section 4.1 ) , energy feedback and chemical evolution have been developed ( chiosi & carraro 2002 ) , indicating that they can reproduce the basic observed properties of e - galaxies as the color - magnitude relation or the @xmath86 ratio versus central velocity dispersion .",
    "these simulations suggest that massive e s form the bulk of the stars in a short timescale , whereas low - mass e s have a complex star formation history : in other words , star formation is early and `` monolithic '' in high initial density systems , irregular and intermittent in low initial density ones . with the models by kawata ( 2001 ) , the low @xmath191 ratio observed in bright ellipticals as well as their brightness profile ( the @xmath28 law ) , can be reproduced adequately by simulations considering the clustering of subclumps caused by initial small - scale density fluctuations .",
    "this phenomenon leads to angular momentum transfer from the baryon component to the dm , resulting in a nearly spherical system supported by random motions .",
    "on the other hand , n - body / sph simulations eventually predict that the morphology ( see section 4.2 ) is a `` transient '' phenomenon within the lifetime of a galaxy and is determined basically by the mode of gas accretion ( steinmetz & navarro 2002 ) .",
    "disks arise from the smooth deposition of cold gas at the center of dm halos while spheroids result from the stirring of preexisting disks during mergers .",
    "age and metallicity effects can be disentangled using ssp models if different indices ( colors or / and spectral ) are used and if the considered stellar system is _ really single _ ( de freitas pacheco 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies are certainly not single systems . if , on the one hand the age range of the population mix constituting the galaxy is probably quite narrow ( 3 - 4 gyr ) , a reason invoked to justify the use of ssp models , on the other hand the build up of chemical elements requires successive stellar generations , producing a metallicity spread adequately described by population mix models .    nevertheless , ssp models have been successfully used to get insight in the chemistry of ellipticals .",
    "a summary of analysis made on different mean elemental abundances in e s can be found in worthey ( 1998 ) .",
    "in the last decade many studies suggested that the mean [ mg / fe ] ratio in bright ellipticals , derived from the comparison between observed and synthetic indices , are non - solar ( worthey et al . 1992 ; carollo & danziger 1994 ; de freitas pacheco 1996a ) .",
    "the resulting enhanced [ mg / fe ] ratio could simply be the consequence of a short period of star formation activity , where the bulk of the stellar population is formed , with successive stellar generations being enriched mainly by the ejecta of type ii supernovae ( snii ) .",

    "relation suggests that the bulk of stars of luminous ellipticals must be rather old , and formed in a short time interval of the order of @xmath221 gyr . in the evolutionary models by idiart et al .",
    "( 2002b ) , the more massive galaxies have a higher star formation efficiency and therefore the slope of the relation mg@xmath62 - @xmath78 increases slightly with the redshift . in fig .",
    "10 the plot of this relation for different redshifts clearly demonstrates this effect .",
    "mg@xmath51 indices of e s in three clusters at intermediate redshifts ( z @xmath208 0.37 ) were compared to those in nearby ( z @xmath208 0 ) clusters by ziegler & bender ( 1997 ) .",
    "these authors found a mean difference @xmath222    between both samples , compatible with a `` passive '' evolution .",
    "in fact , using their data on the velocity dispersion and theoretical mg@xmath62 - @xmath78 relations , the predicted mean difference @xmath223 is 0.34 (mg@xmath224 ) , consistent with observations . moreover",

    "( 1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "the results are again explained by the passive evolution of a population formed at @xmath226 .",
    "van dokkum et al . (",
    "2000 ) have obtained extensive color data for e s in a cluster at @xmath227 , concluding by a passive evolution of a population mix older than @xmath215 .",
    "the rle played by the @xmath200-elements , represented mainly by magnesium , in the evolution of early - type galaxies was recently reviewed by thomas et al .",
    "they use ssp models with variable [ @xmath200/fe ] ratios to analyze line - indices in a sample of 126 field and cluster local e - galaxies , and find a correlation between the @xmath228 $ ] ratio and the velocity dispersion ( see also de freitas pacheco 1996 ) , and also between this ratio and the estimated mean population age .",
    "they conclude that the more massive the galaxy , the shorter is its star formation scale , and the higher is the redshift of the bulk of the star formation .",
    "these findings are not compatible with the predictions of hierarchical models of galaxy formation .",
    "these conclusions are in line with evolutionary models as presented by idiart et al ( 2000b ) .",
    "the morphological classification of galaxies , extended to large @xmath4 from hst images , leads to rather ambiguous results .",
    "this is in part due to the intrinsic difficulty of this exercise , with different observers obtaining divergent results from the same data ( fabricant et al . 2000 ) .",
    "dressler et al . ( 1997 ) found a relative high fraction of spirals accompanied by a low fraction of s0 s in clusters within the redshift range @xmath229 , concluding that the former classes transform into the later morphological types .",
    "other authors ( see , for instance , andreon et al .",
    "1997 ) find a much `` milder '' evolution of the s / s0 ratio .",
    "van dokkum et al . ( 2000 ) studied the rich cluster ms1054 - 03 at @xmath230 and found a deficit in the population of early - type galaxies , reaching a factor of 2 from @xmath231 to @xmath232 .",
    "moreover , they have estimated that the fraction of very close binary ( or interacting ) galaxies , probably future mergers , is 17% , which could support the idea that ellipticals are  merged \" spirals .    in conclusion ,",
    "the stars in ellipticals ( or most of them by mass and light ) are no doubt old from their spectral properties and the corresponding @xmath4 variations .",
    "but they may have been reassembled much later into their present nice spheroidal systems : franx & van dokkum ( 2001 ) have proposed a mechanism to reconcile these conflicting indications , at least as far as cluster galaxies are concerned .",
    "the recent high quality imaging and kinematical data on ellipticals have shown that besides tri - axiallity , these galaxies have a complex structure including the presence of inner disks , cores and cuspy light profiles .",
    "the tri - axiallity inferred from radial variations of the axial ratios was further supported by new data , suggesting substantial rotation along the minor axis . moreover",
    ", such high quality data demonstrated the existence of small central components not sharing the rotation of the main body , which are interpreted as the result of capture of a small nearby galaxy .",
    "there is presently strong evidences that most ( if not all ) ellipticals host in their centers a massive black hole able to modify the profile of the very central matter distribution ( baryonic and non - baryonic ) .",
    "these smbh form perhaps contemporaneously with all stellar spheroids , a picture supported by the observed correlation between the smbh mass and the central velocity dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "the dynamical evidence for the presence of dark matter in the central regions either of spirals or ellipticals is not conclusive , since the predicted `` cuspy '' profiles from numerical simulations are not seen in rotation curves , and stars can provide the required gravitational field inside the optical radius to explain kinematical data .",
    "however , at larger distances , the confinement of the hot gas seen in x - rays implies the existence of a substantial amount of dark matter in halos , also supported by recent kinematic data on planetary nebulae and globular clusters , in the outskirts of giant ellipticals .",
    "the extensive numerical simulations performed by several authors indicate that the density distribution inside dark matter halos , formed through successive merging episodes , can be represented by an `` universal '' profile , independent of the parameters defining the cosmological model , the mass of the halo or the redshift .",
    "the understanding of the heating and cooling of the baryon component is an essential key in the process of galaxy formation , since it permits the definition of a critical mass ( for a given dark halo mass ) above which star formation is triggered .",
    "however many problems still remain unsolved , as the origin of the angular momentum and its relation with the galactic morphology . in the hierarchical scenario ,",
    "the morphology is the consequence of a particular merger and accretion history that galaxies experience during their assembly .",
    "disks are the result of gas accreted smoothly from the intergalactic medium , while spheroids would be formed through major merger events where disks are mixed and relaxed violently .",
    "the bulk of the stellar populations of e s is quite old ( 12 - 13 gyr ) , according to the interpretation of the integrated colors and the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "however , based mainly on the h@xmath52 and @xmath192 indices , some authors found galaxies with stellar populations substantially younger , sometimes in contradiction with the observed colors .",
    "it should be emphasize that other effects than age or emission may affect the @xmath233 index as , for instance , the horizontal branch morphology ( de freitas pacheco & barbuy 1995 ; de freitas pacheco 1998 ) .",
    "recent star formation episodes triggered by accretion of intergalactic material or small nearby galaxies can not be excluded , and appears prominent in several local objects .",
    "a further indication of an initial and intense star formation period is provided by the relative abundance of the @xmath200-elements , which is a `` clock '' suggesting that the majority of the stars were formed in a timescale of 2 - 3 gyr .",
    "most of the e s have mean metallicities near solar , which is an indication of a population mix , constituted of different generations required to the build up of the chemical elements .    the colors , the color - magnitude diagram ( most probably a metallicity - mass diagram ) and the relative abundance of the @xmath200-elements favors an evolutive scenario where the star formation activity begins after the assembly of a critical mass of gas , according to the description given previously .",
    "after the triggering , most of the stars are formed in a relatively short timescale ( 2 - 3 gyr ) and then evolve `` passively '' .",
    "these conclusions , as seen in section 5.2 , are reinforced by the small scatter in the m / l ratio derived from the fundamental plane and its decrease with redshift , equivalent to a brightening of the galaxies with @xmath4 .",
    "the evolution of the luminosity function of `` red '' galaxies also points in such a direction , as well as the evolution of the mg@xmath51 - @xmath78 relation , although the available data on the latter can not be considered as conclusive . on the other hand ,",
    "the main argument in favor of an assembly of spirals to form ellipticals is the possible decrease of the fraction of the latter at higher redshifts , an evidence criticized by some authors on the basis of the difficulties to distinguish morphological types at high @xmath4 .",
    "the two scenarii ,  monolithic `` versus  hierarchical '' , sketched in our introductory section to describe the origin and evolution of ellipticals , will probably be no more tenable in a near future , at least in their simplistic forms .",
    "recently observers and theoreticians have made great strides towards a synthesis .",
    "the epochs of major stellar formation have been identified from very deep multi - wave - length surveys ( steidel , 1999 ) and from the analysis of the cosmic ir background ( gispert et al .",
    "the stellar formation rate strongly declined after @xmath216 and was possibly maximal near @xmath234 .",
    "the brightest galaxies detected at such epochs ( lyman break galaxies ) seem to be analogous to the local luminous ir galaxies with intense star formation behind an heavy dust  curtain \" .",
