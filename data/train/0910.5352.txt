    "long time ago dyakonov and perel predicted , that in some systems transverse spin current and spin accumulation may be induced by electric current  @xcite .",
    "this effect , known as spin hall effect ( she ) , is currently extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite ( see also review papers  @xcite ) .",
    "the effect may appear in semiconductors as well as in metals , and originates from spin - orbit interaction .",
    "generally , such an interaction may be of intrinsic or extrinsic origin .",
    "the extrinsic she is associated with scattering mechanisms , like skew scattering and side jump in the presence of impurities . in turn , the intrinsic mechanism of she is a consequence of an unusual trajectory of the charge carriers in the momentum space , which may be described by the berry phase formalism  @xcite .",
    "this contribution will be referred to as the topological one .",
    "in this paper we consider the topological contribution to spin hall conductivity in a system of dirac fermions with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "generally , the form of spin - orbit interaction depends on the symmetry and structure of the system .",
    "the dirac model turned out to be useful not only in the relativistic field theory , but also in condensed matter physics to describe some features of electronic spectrum ( at least in a certain energy range ) .",
    "one of such systems is two - dimensional graphene , and in this paper we consider dirac fermions with the spin - orbit interaction taken in the form appropriate for graphene and including both intrinsic and rashba terms .",
    "we believe , that the results derived here will shed some light on the spin hall effect in graphene .",
    "graphene is a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms , with two nonequivalent sublattices .",
    "the low - energy electron states near the k and k points at opposite corners of the brillouine zone can be approximated by the conical energy spectrum . as a result ,",
    "charge carriers are described by the dirac equation  @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface in a neutral graphene consists of the nonequivalent points k and k , at which the valence and conduction bands touch each other",
    ". however , when the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction is included , an energy gap opens at these points .",
    "unfortunately , it is now believed that the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling in graphene is rather weak so the gap is also small .",
    "since the graphene layer is usually on a substrate , one also can expect spin - orbit interaction of rashba type @xcite .",
    "moreover , the corresponding coupling parameter can be tuned externally by a gate voltage .",
    "indeed , a large rashba spin - orbit interaction has been reported in a recent experiment  @xcite .",
    "kane and mele  @xcite have shown that the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction opens an energy gap at the dirac points , and also have predicted a quantized value of the spin hall conductivity when the fermi level is in the gap .",
    "the quantized spin hall conductivity at the dirac points was also confirmed by later analytical and numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of rashba spin - orbit interaction reduces the gap , and when the rashba interaction is stronger than the intrinsic one , the gap becomes closed . since the magnitude of intrinsic spin - orbit interaction seems to be significantly smaller than that assumed originally  @xcite , it is possible to reach the limit opposite to that considered by kane and mele , i.e. the limit where the rashba coupling dominates while intrinsic spin - orbit interaction is negligible . to our knowledge ,",
    "spin hall effect in this limit has not been considered analytically so far .",
    "therefore , in this paper we present analytical and numerical results obtained within the linear response theory and green functions technique , assuming both intrinsic and rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we focus on the topological contribution to the effect assuming perfect crystal lattice and ignoring impurities and defects , which however may influence the magnitude of spin hall effect in real systems @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the model and present a general formula for the spin hall conductivity .",
    "the case of pure intrinsic spin - orbit interaction is presented in section 3 , while the case of rasba interaction is described and discussed in section 4 .",
    "the general case , where both interactions are present , is described in section 5 , while summary and final conclusions are in section 6 .",
    "including both intrinsic and rashba spin - orbit coupling , the effective mass hamiltonian  @xcite of graphene can be written in the form @xmath0 the first term , @xmath1 , describes the low - energy electronic states around the dirac points k and k in the brillouin zone , and has the form @xmath2 where the upper and lower signs correspond to the points k and k , respectively , and @xmath3 is a parameter describing the conical energy spectrum , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 denoting the electron fermi velocity . the second term in eq.(1 )",
    "describes the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction in graphene , @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the relevant parameter ( @xmath8 is the gap created by the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling in the dirac points ) .",
    "finally , the last term in eq.(1 ) stands for the rashba spin - orbit term , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the corresponding coupling parameter . as in eq.(2 ) , the upper and lower signs in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) correspond to the two inequivalent points k and k of the brillouin zone , respectively .    to obtain spin hall conductivity",
    "we introduce first the spin current density operator , @xmath11_{+},\\ ] ] where @xmath12_+=ab + ba$ ] denotes the anticommutator of any operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the velocity operator ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 is the @xmath18-th component ( @xmath19 ) of the spin operator . taking into account the exact form of",
    "hamiltonian @xmath20 one finds @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the @xmath24 unit matrix .    in the linear response theory ,",
    "the dc spin hall conductivity is given by the formula  @xcite , @xmath25_{+}g_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\varepsilon + \\omega)v_{y}g_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\varepsilon),\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the causal green function corresponding to the hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "this formula will be used in the following to calculate spin hall conductivity in some specific cases as well as in a general situation .",
    "we will consider first the special case , when the rashba coupling vanishes , while the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction is nonzero , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "such a situation has been already considered analytically in the clean limit@xcite , and also studied numerically in the presence of impurities@xcite .",

    "the contribution @xmath33 takes the form @xmath34 where the upper sign refers to the situation when the fermi level is in the valence band , while the lower one when the fermi level is in the conduction band . in turn",

    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]    thus , from eqs ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) follows that the whole spin hall conductivity can be written as @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the above result coincides with the ones obtained by kane and mele@xcite and sinitsyn et al  @xcite .",
    "the other two component of the spin hall conductivity , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 vanish , as one could expect .",
    "the corresponding numerical results are shown in fig.1 for three different values of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "additional factor of 2 has been taken into account in order to include the two dirac points k and k. the spin hall conductivity is shown there as a function of the chemical potential measured from the middle of the gap .",
    "when the fermi level is in the energy gap , the hall conductivity is constant and quantized .",
    "when , in turn , the fermi level is either in the valence or conduction bands , the absolute value of conductivity decreases , and disappears for @xmath46 .",
