    "the tachocline , which is believed to exist near the base of the solar convection zone @xcite , has become a subject of rapidly growing scientific interest in the last years @xcite .",
    "the existence of the tachocline is important for two main reasons .",
    "first , it may prevent the spread of the solar angular momentum from the convection zone to the interior @xcite , thus retaining the inferred solid body rotation in the radiative zone ; second , the processes of solar magnetic field generation and global magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instabilities , which are crucial for solar activity , may take place there @xcite .",
    "mhd waves and oscillations in the tachocline may play a significant role in both cases : they may redistribute the angular momentum in the horizontal direction and some of them may become unstable due to the differential rotation , leading to magnetic flux emergence at the solar surface . therefore , to study the complete spectrum of possible wave modes in this system is of vital importance .",
    "the tachocline is very thin compared to the solar radius , therefore the ordinary shallow water approximation modified by the presence of a horizontal large - scale magnetic field can be easily applied @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of various shorter scale shallow water mhd waves has been recently studied in cartesian coordinates by @xcite .",
    "however , global wave modes , those with a wavelength comparable to the solar radius , must be considered in spherical coordinates .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the spherical shallow water mhd waves in the simplest case , in which the high frequency branch i.e. magnetic poincar waves ( or magneto - gravity waves ) and the influence of the tachocline thickness on the wave dynamics have been ignored ( that is , when the surface gravity speed is much higher than the surface rotation speed ) . this approximation has enabled us to study the dynamics of global magnetic rossby waves in the lower , strongly stable part of the tachocline , but it fails in the upper , weakly stable overshoot region , where a negative buoyancy due to the subadiabatic stratification strongly reduces the gravity speed @xcite .    in this letter , we present the analytical spectrum of global linear shallow water mhd waves for both parts of the tachocline in the absence of differential rotation .",
    "we use the linearized shallow water mhd equations in the rotating spherical coordinate system ( @xmath0 ) , where @xmath1 is the radial coordinate , @xmath2 is the co - latitude , and @xmath3 is the longitude @xcite .",
    "we also assume the unperturbed toroidal magnetic field to be @xmath4 , where @xmath5 may have an arbitrary profile with latitude , which can be chosen later .",
    "then a normal mode analysis of the form @xmath6 gives the equation @xcite",
    "@xmath7\\right \\}{\\hat u}_{\\theta } -(\\lambda^2 -\\mu^2){\\hat u}_{\\theta } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ s^2\\alpha^2{\\hat u}_{\\theta } + 2\\alpha^2\\mu d{\\hat u}_{\\theta } + \\mu s { \\alpha^2\\over \\lambda}(d+2\\mu){\\hat u}_{\\theta}+\\mu d(\\alpha^2 ) { \\hat u}_{\\theta}=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the poloidal velocity component , @xmath10 is the reduced gravity in the tachocline , @xmath11 is the medium density , @xmath12 is the angular velocity , @xmath13 is the distance from the solar center to the tachocline , and @xmath14 is the tachocline thickness .",
    "this is the general equation for the linear dynamics of the shallow water mhd system , which contains various kinds of waves ( magnetic poincar and magnetic rossby waves ) .",
    "when @xmath15 and @xmath16 , this equation transforms into the associated legendre equation and governs the dynamics of fast and slow magnetic rossby waves @xcite .",
    "this approximation neglects magnetic poincar waves and the influence of the tachocline thickness on the dynamics of magnetic rossby waves .",
    "therefore , equation ( 1 ) must be solved with @xmath17 in order to give the complete spectrum of waves .",
    "the subadiabatic stratification in the tachocline provides negative buoyancy , which leads to a reduced gravity and consequently an increased value of @xmath18 . in the lower strongly stable part of the tachocline",
    "@xmath18 still is much smaller than unity , but in upper overshoot layer @xmath18 becomes much greater than unity .",
    "therefore , the solution of equation ( 1 ) for the two extreme cases @xmath19 and @xmath20 covers both parts of the tachocline . here",
    "we use a magnetic field profile typical of the sun , namely @xmath21 which has opposite signs in the northern and southern hemispheres @xcite . the magnetic field profile ( 2 )",
    "leads to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . in the next subsections we will give analytical solutions and dispersion relations of global shallow water mhd waves for each case separately .",
    "reduced gravity in the strongly stable radiative part of the tachocline can be estimated as 5001.5 @xmath24 10@xmath25 cm@xmath24s@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "then , for the layer thickness @xmath14=10@xmath28 cm we get @xmath29 4.5 @xmath24 10@xmath30  0.13 ( where @xmath12=2.6 @xmath24 10@xmath31 s@xmath32 , @xmath13=5@xmath24 10@xmath33 cm have been used ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 is a good approximation in the radiative part of the tachocline .    in this approximation and using the weak magnetic field limit , i.e. @xmath34 , equation ( 1 ) leads to the spheroidal wave equation ( second order terms with @xmath18 and @xmath35 are neglected ) , whose typical solutions are the spheroidal wave functions @xmath36 @xcite , where @xmath37 plays the role of the poloidal wavenumber .",
    "the approximate solution can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the amplitude and @xmath40 note that @xmath37 is integer for the solutions , which vanish at the poles ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the dispersion relation is found to be @xmath42    the dispersion relation can be split into high ( magnetic poincar ) and low ( magnetic rossby ) frequency branches . for the magnetic poincar waves we have @xmath43",
    "this is the dispersion relation of ordinary surface gravity waves and we can recover it for the high @xmath44 harmonics @xcite .    for the magnetic rossby waves we have approximately @xmath45    it is clear from equation ( 6 ) that the magnetic field causes the splitting of ordinary rossby waves into fast and slow modes @xcite . for @xmath46",
    "the dispersion relations for the fast and slow magnetic rossby modes can be approximated as @xmath47 we see that the fast magnetic rossby mode has a dispersion relation similar to that of the ordinary rossby waves but slightly modified by the magnetic field .",
    "slow magnetic rossby waves , however , are new wave modes as their dispersion relation is different from rossby and alfvn wave dispersion relations ( the dispersion relation of alfvn waves should be @xmath48 ) .",
    "there is a significant difference between the frequencies of fast and slow magnetic rossby modes for sufficiently small @xmath49 .",
    "the dispersion diagram for the @xmath50 harmonics of shallow water mhd waves according to eq .",
    "( [ dr_small_eps ] ) is shown in fig 1 . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the frequencies of magnetic poincar waves ( solid lines ) are much higher than the rotational frequency , @xmath12 , and they increase with increasing @xmath37 .",
    "for example , the frequency of the @xmath53 harmonics is @xmath54 , which corresponds to oscillations with period @xmath55 13 hours . on the other hand ,",
    "the frequencies of magnetic rossby waves are in general much lower than the rotational frequency .",
    "the absolute value of the frequency of fast magnetic rossby waves ( dotted line in the zoom ) decreases with increasing @xmath37 , such as happens with the hd rossby wave .",
    "2 shows the dependence of the @xmath56 and @xmath57 harmonics on @xmath18 and @xmath49 ( i.e. the magnetic field strength ) .",
    "the frequency ( in absolute value ) of fast ( dotted ) and slow ( dashed ) magnetic rossby modes significantly increases when the magnetic field is increased .",
    "we also see that the frequency difference between the @xmath58 harmonics of fast magnetic rossby waves is almost independent of @xmath49 . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath58 harmonics of slow magnetic rossby waves diverge when the magnetic field is increased .",
    "it turns out that the frequencies of magnetic rossby waves have almost no dependence on @xmath18 , therefore they are not shown in the top panel . on the other hand ,",
    "the frequency of magnetic poincar waves depends on @xmath18 ( lower panel ) and significantly decreases with increasing @xmath18 . however , these frequencies have almost no dependence on @xmath49 , therefore magnetic poincar waves are only slightly affected by the magnetic field .      in the weakly stable overshoot region ( or say upper tachocline ) reduced gravity is much smaller , being 0.055 cm@xmath24s@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "then , for the thickness @xmath14=5",
    "@xmath24 10@xmath59 cm we get @xmath29 27  2.7 @xmath24 10@xmath60 . therefore , @xmath61 is a good approximation in the overshoot region .    in this case , we follow the calculation of @xcite ( this paper considers spherical hydrodynamic shallow water waves in the earth context ) , and introduce a new function @xmath62 and also consider that @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is of order unity .",
    "then after some algebra and keeping only large terms equation ( 1 ) leads to the weber ( parabolic cylinder ) equation , whose solutions finite at @xmath66 can be expressed in terms of hermite polynomials @xmath67 of order @xmath68 , where @xmath68 satisfies @xmath69 and the solution is proportional to @xmath70 therefore the function @xmath71 is exponentially small beyond the turning points @xmath72 . due to the large @xmath18 ,",
    "the co - latitude @xmath2 satisfying this condition is close to @xmath73 , therefore the solution is confined to the neighborhood of the equator .",
    "equation ( 8) yields the wave dispersion relation as @xmath74 in the non - magnetic case this equation transforms into equation ( 8.11 ) of @xcite .",
    "this is a fourth order equation and it describes magnetic poincar and magnetic rossby waves . for large values of @xmath18 , the solutions can be written separately for both types of waves .    the solutions for poincar waves can be written approximately as @xmath75 it turns out that the magnetic field has almost no influence on the dynamics of poincar waves and the dispersion relation is the same as for the nonmagnetic case @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation for the magnetic rossby waves can be written as @xmath76 the magnetic field causes the splitting of ordinary rossby waves into fast and slow magnetic rossby waves as in the @xmath19 case . if @xmath77 , then we can write @xmath78 fast magnetic rossby waves are similar to hydrodynamic rossby waves modified by the magnetic field .",
    "slow magnetic rossby waves have a similar dispersion relation as in the @xmath19 case .",
    "the dispersion diagram for the @xmath50 harmonics of magnetic poincar and magnetic rossby waves according to eq .",
    "( 10 ) is shown in fig 3 . here",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath52 .",
    "the behaviour of fast magnetic rossby waves ( dotted line ) is similar to the small @xmath18 case : the absolute value of their frequency significantly decreases with increasing @xmath68 ( which now plays the role of the poloidal wave number ) .",
    "however , we immediately note that the frequency now is much smaller than that of the @xmath80 case .",
    "this is also true for magnetic poincar waves ( solid lines ) : their frequency is significantly small compared to the case of small @xmath18 , now being even smaller than the rotational frequency .",
    "the frequency of slow magnetic rossby waves only slightly depends on @xmath68 , but now it decreases with increasing @xmath68 , contrary to @xmath80 case .    fig .",
    "4 shows the dependence of the @xmath81 and @xmath82 harmonics on @xmath18 and @xmath49 .",
    "the frequency of magnetic rossby mode harmonics significantly depends on @xmath49 ; the frequencies of both fast and slow magnetic rossby modes increase with increasing @xmath49 . on the other hand , it turns out that the frequencies of magnetic poincar waves have almost no dependence on @xmath49 .",
    "however , they are significantly reduced with increasing @xmath18 , becoming smaller than the rotational frequency for @xmath83 .",
    "fast magnetic rossby waves also depend on @xmath18 , their frequency significantly decreasing when this parameter is increased .",
    "slow magnetic rossby waves have almost no dependence on @xmath18 as it is suggested from eq .",
    "( [ approx_fs_large_eps ] ) .",
    "thus increasing @xmath18 , which is equivalent to reducing @xmath10 , generally leads to a decrease of the wave frequencies .",
    "the numerical solution of the dispersion relation ( 10 ) shows that the frequency of the magnetic rossby wave harmonic with @xmath84 becomes complex for sufficiently large @xmath49 , i.e. large magnetic field .",
    "this may point to some kind of instabilities similar to the polar kink instability found by cally ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , the value of @xmath49 for which the frequency becomes complex is significantly outside the range for which eq . (",
    "10 ) is valid ( note that @xmath49 should be proportional to @xmath85 ) .",
    "therefore , the complex solution can be spurious and may not reflect a real instability .",
    "we have derived analytical solutions and dispersion relations of global shallow water mhd waves for the solar tachocline in a rotating spherical coordinate system .",
    "the solutions and dispersion relations are obtained for weakly and strongly stable stratifications separately .",
    "the weakly stable stratification is valid in the upper overshoot part of tachocline , while the strongly stable stratification is valid for the radiative part of tachocline .",
    "the solutions include the poincar and rossby waves modified by the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "here we use a realistic latitudinal profile of the toroidal magnetic field @xmath86 that changes sign at the equator .",
    "similar to the @xmath15 case @xcite , the magnetic field leads to the splitting of hydrodynamic rossby waves into fast and slow magnetic rossby modes .    in the case of strongly stable stratification ,",
    "the dispersion relation of magnetic poincar waves is similar to that of the hydrodynamic case @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation of magnetic rossby waves @xcite is slightly modified by the thickness of the layer . in the case of weakly stable stratification , both magnetic poincar and magnetic rossby waves",
    "are concentrated near the equator , thus leading to equatorially trapped waves .",
    "another remarkable feature is that the frequencies of all waves are significantly reduced in the large @xmath18 case compared to the @xmath80 one .",
    "this means that the upper overshoot part of the tachocline supports oscillations with smaller frequency than the lower radiative part of the tachocline .",
    "the solutions have been obtained without taking into account the differential rotation which is present in the tachocline .",
    "the future inclusion of differential rotation probably will lead to the instability of some modes , which was found by simulations in the inertial frame ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
