    "a distinctive feature of snia spectra near maximum light is the presence of intermediate - mass elements from si to ca moving at velocities 10000 - 16000 km.s@xmath5 . in particular the presence or not of the siii absorption feature at @xmath6   is basic to identify a type i supernovae as snia . according to observations about 0.2 - 0.4 m@xmath4 of ime",
    "have to be synthesized during the explosion .",
    "an amount of ime larger than 0.2m@xmath4  is also needed to explain the observed abundances of these elements in the solar neighborhood @xcite . therefore , any attempt to build a satisfactory theoretical model of these explosions has to give the right amount of intermediate - mass elements .    in this respect",
    "the underproduction of intermediate - mass elements found in current pure deflagration models of type ia supernovae is a long standing problem of theoretical modelization of these explosions . on fundamental basis",
    "we know that these elements have to be synthesized below densities @xmath7  in an expanding medium .",
    "nevertheless the resolution achieved by the best multidimensional models carried out to date is far from adequate to solve unambigously this problem . in this work",
    "we have taken another route to address this issue .",
    "instead of performing a multidimensional calculation incorporating the unresolved scales as a subgrid we have simulated the evolution of an expanding nuclear flame in planar aproximation with very good resolution .",
    "we have then used the results to put limits to the amount of ime synthesized in a deflagration .",
    "the usefulness of our approximation requires that the synthesis of elements within the mass range @xmath8a@xmath9   takes place , for the most part , during the flamelet regime .",
    "in such a regime the flame , although highly wrinkled and distorted , still preserves its identity .",
    "unfortunately the precise value of the minimum density at which the flamelet hypothesis still holds is not known .",
    "there are indications that transition from the flamelet to the distributive regime in the combustion diagram could begin around @xmath10  @xcite , and we can take it as a reference .    keeping that constraint in mind",
    "we have proceeded in the following way .",
    "first , the detailed structure and evolution of a nuclear flame propagating through an expanding background has been solved for a reasonable set of characteristic expansion times and the nucleosynthetic yields calculated using a simplified @xmath11-network of 14 nuclei , @xmath12 . with that information we provide in @xmath13   a rough calculation of the total amount of ime synthesized in a typical deflagration of a white dwarf as a function of the effective surface of heat exchange between ashes and fuel at the densities of interest , the turbulence intensity and the characteristic expansion time .",
    "according to our results a subsonic deflagration is able to produce more than 0.2m@xmath4  of ime although only in a limited region of parameter space .",
    "this point is discussed in the chapter devoted to the conclusions , @xmath14 , as well as possibles issues and limitations of our work .",
    "from the nucleosynthetic point of view ime are the main product of incomplete si burning at @xmath15   followed by @xmath11-rich freeze - out until the quenching of nuclear reactions . during the explosion of a massive white dwarf",
    "such combustion regime is attained when the density ahead the flame drops below @xmath16  g.@xmath17  in a medium which is rapidly expanding . as density decreases ,",
    "the laminar velocity of the flame goes down , its width enlarges and the nucleosynthetic products are enriched first in ime and later in @xmath18 mg  and @xmath19o . finally the flame becomes a thermal wave and no more nuclear combustion takes place : _ the flame dies_. even though the thickness of the zone where ime are synthesized in the planar case is already really narrow , around half kilometer ( see below ) , the surface of the flame in a real situation is so distorted by hydrodynamical instabilities that the effective volume might be enough to account for the observed amount of ime .",
    "one important consequence is that , once developed , the hydrodynamical instabilities make the effective burning velocity independent of the laminar velocity of the flame (   3 ) .",
    "we have devised a numerical experiment to investigate whether or not the adequate amount of ime can be produced by the above mechanism .",
    "first of all we have made an estimation of the total amount of chemical species generated by a planar flame moving through a rapidly expanding media .",
    "although in the end the effective turbulent burning velocity will become independent of the laminar value such calculation is worthwhile because : 1 ) it provides the mass fraction of the isotopes of interest to be used in the next section when turbulence effects are taken into account , 2 ) it shows the futility of trying the synthesis of ime in a real explosion when the flame only moves at its laminar speed , and 3 ) knowing the physics of an expanding planar nuclear flame is an interesting topic by itself as it represents a natural extension of the work by timmes & woosley ( 1992 ) ( tw afterwards ) .",
    "the ouptut of the expanding planar flame calculation gives a fundamental quantity : @xmath20 , the mass of ime synthesized in a column with 1 @xmath21  section .",
    "for a given amount of burnt material @xmath22  we compute the mass fraction of ime , x@xmath2  synthesized below a fixed starting density @xmath23  for different expansion rates .",
    "later on (   3 )   we make use of x@xmath2  to get an estimation of the total amount of ime ejected during a typical type ia supernova event .",
    "the quantity @xmath20  was calculated by following the propagation of the nuclear flame in planar geometry as explained in cabezn et al .",
    "basically the integration scheme uses an @xmath11-network with 14 nuclei and _ implicit thermal coupling _ with the energy equation to follow the combustion under isobaric conditions .",
    "the resulting method is robust and stable , allowing to properly handle the rear tail of the flame where most of the elements of interest were synthesized .",
    "in addition an exponential reduction in density ahead the flame , with a characteristic time @xmath24 , is imposed .",
    "the resulting set of equations are :    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27\\ ] ]    @xmath28    where @xmath29  stands for particle reaction rates , @xmath30   is for photodisintegrations and the rest of the symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath31  was taken from appendix 1 in khokhlov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and we have taken an uniform initial density of the fuel @xmath32  . the precise value of @xmath23  is irrelevant for the results as long as it is larger than the density at which ime begin to be produced . at each step",
    "we enforce the temperature of the unburnt material , located far enough from the flame front , to evolve adiabatically .",
    "the instantaneous value of t and @xmath33 far ahead the flame sets the value of p@xmath34  in equation ( 4 ) . across the flame",
    "the evolution is governed by heat difussion and binary @xmath35  reaction , whereas in the burned zone far from the flame front the incinerated material relaxes to either fe - peak elements or to ime if density becomes low enough .",
    "the integration scheme is a standard lagrangian code with enough mass - shells to resolve the structure of the flame . at the beginning of the calculation",
    "a small group of shells were put into nuclear statistical equilibrium at constant pressure . very soon a steady nuclear flame developed and propagated through the cold fuel ( composed by equal parts of carbon and oxygen ) .",
    "as the flame progressed we kept a constant number of mass - shells ahead the flame ( around 100 ) in order to save computer time .",
    "finally the calculation was stopped when the temperature in the burned zone dropped below two billion degrees and all nuclear reactions virtually quenched . at the end of the calculation",
    "there were typically between @xmath36  to @xmath37  shells in combustion , depending on the characteristic expansion time @xmath24 .",
    "it was necessary to calculate several millions of time steps in order to follow the whole process .    in figure 1",
    "it is shown a snapshot of the mass fraction profile at t=0.1523 s , which is the time at which total ime abundance freezes in our reference model with @xmath38  s. as we can see @xmath39si as well as other ime with higher atomic mass were synthesized in a tiny layer , lesser than 0.3 km , which is more than one order of magnitude below the resolution of the best three - dimensional simulations carried out so far .",
    "moreover because during the explosion the flame is shattered by turbulence that length represents an upper limit of the size of pockets of ashes made of elements belonging to the silicon family .",
    "elements lighter than silicon such as magnesium and neon were produced at lower density in a very narrow region behind the flame edge . in figure 2",
    "we depict the evolution of the total synthesized mass of elements between @xmath39si  to @xmath40ca for @xmath41  s as a function of the fuel density . from these figures",
    "it is clear that for plausible expansion times the ime are synthesized in the density range @xmath42  , as it was recognized many years ago . in particular",
    ", we see that 95% of ime were already synthesized at densities higher than @xmath10   .",
    "in fact , more than a half of their final mass was produced when the density of the fuel was still above @xmath43  .",
    "this is an interesting feature because it suggests that important nuclei for snia spectroscopy , such as silicon and calcium , are probably synthesized during the so - called flamelet regime of turbulent combustion , much more easier to handle than the distributive regime .",
    "below @xmath44  we found an increase of direct carbon and oxygen combustion products , neon and magnesium in our network , in a region of size @xmath45  km .",
    "however in a real physical situation the final abundance of elements below silicon might be altered if combustion enters the distributive regime .",
    "the velocities of the flame , fitted using the total amount of burnt fuel ( see eq.7 below ) , are in reasonable agreement with those obtained by tw at different densities .",
    "we obtain slightly lower values because the limited nuclear network used to carry out the calculations .",
    "for example , we obtained v=0.14 , 0.23 , and 0.33 km.s@xmath5  at @xmath46=2 , 3 and 4 respectively , to be compared to those calculated by tw , v@xmath47=0.19 , 0.32 , 0.46 km.s@xmath5  at the same densities .",
    "the instantaneous width of the flame was also consistent with tw calculation .",
    "the detailed final yields of the 14 nuclei for several characteristic expansion times are shown in table 1 .",
    "as we can see , there is a monotonic increase of the final mass of the most abundant species with the expansion time @xmath24 . for @xmath48",
    "s we got @xmath49",
    "g.@xmath50   of silicon whereas for @xmath51  s the synthesized mass was @xmath52  g.@xmath50 .",
    "the same trend is true for the size of the region where these elements are significatively produced : @xmath53  km ( @xmath48  s ) to @xmath54  km ( @xmath51  s ) . even in the last case",
    "the width of the ime layer is much smaller than the size of the burned region , typically 2000 km .",
    "thus in the lagrangian one - dimensional picture it can be regarded as a very thin layer on top of a volume made basically of fe - peak elements .",
    "the mass of fuel consumed during the propagation of an expanding planar flame starting at an initial density @xmath23  can be found analytically because the density dependence of the laminar velocity is known ( tw ) :    @xmath55    from our results @xmath56  km.s@xmath5  at @xmath32  , and @xmath57 .",
    "using equation 3 the mass of burned fuel per unit surface in an elapsed time @xmath58  is :    @xmath59}~dt=\\\\ \\nonumber \\rho_0~v_0~\\frac{\\tau_c}{(1+n)}\\left[1-\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(1+n)\\delta t}{\\tau_c}\\right)}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    taking @xmath60  in equation 6 gives a good approximation to the the total burnt mass per unit surface :    @xmath61    hence the amount of consumed fuel below the starting density @xmath23  in the expanding background is simply proportional to the product of the laminar velocity and the characteristic expansion time .",
    "the laminar velocity of the flame is rather well known within , at most , a factor two uncertainity .",
    "the value of the characteristic expansion time @xmath24  is probably dependent of the particular explosion dynamics .",
    "a rough lower limit for @xmath24  is the characteristic hydrodynamical time scale @xmath62  s at @xmath63  which matches well also the behaviour of a particular deflagrative one - dimensional model @xcite as shown in figure 3 .",
    "a reasonable range for @xmath24  is @xmath64  once the flame has reached densities below @xmath65  , although higher values , nearing 0.5 seconds , can not be totally discarded . in table 2 there is shown the total amount of burned mass as well as the masses of ime and nickel synthesized below @xmath23  as a function of @xmath24 . as we can see the burnt mass scales linearly with @xmath24 , as suggested by equation 7",
    "however , the amount of synthesized ime is not proportional to the characteristic expansion time because a longer value of @xmath24  leads to the formation of more iron as the nuclear system has more room to relax .",
    "a simple fitting formulae to the values of @xmath20  given in table 2 that can be also used to extrapolate @xmath20  beyond 0.3 s , until @xmath66  s if necessary , is :    @xmath67    as mentioned before , the mass of ime given by equation 8 is independent of the particular value chosen for @xmath23  in equation 3 provided it is high enough to resolve the region where intermediate - mass elements are synthesized .",
    "however their mass fraction , x@xmath2 , within the burnt material is a function of the starting density @xmath23  in the exponential expansion . for @xmath32",
    "it can be fitted using :    @xmath68",
    "another remarkable feature shown in table 2 is that the production of @xmath69ni is no longer negligible , especially for @xmath3  s. at the longest expansion time considered here , @xmath51",
    "s , the amount of @xmath69ni is practically equal to that of ime .",
    "a quantitative estimation of the total amount of ime ejected in a snia explosion may be done provided the effective flame surface at densities @xmath70  is somehow known .",
    "however , this is a difficult task that will have to be addressed in the future through high resolution multidimensional simulations . for the time being we give only a qualitative discussion about this point taking advantage of the self - similar behaviour of the main physical agents responsible for the corrugation of the flame .",
    "there has been shown @xcite , that a large increase in flame surface can only be attributed to two physical mechanisms : the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability and turbulence .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that both are self - similar phenomena that can be approximately described using three parameters : the maximum and minimum scale - lengths , @xmath71  and the average fractal dimension d of the corrugated flame surface . in this approximation",
    "the incinerated mass is given by :    @xmath72    where @xmath73  is the average radius of the flame and @xmath74  stems for its laminar velocity . even though in the supernova the nuclear flame becomes highly distorted and shattered by turbulence and hydrodynamical instabilities the amout of fuel consumed per unit area given by the integral part of equation 10 should not be very different from @xmath22  given by equation 7 corresponding to the planar case analyzed in the previous section .",
    "however many experiments in combustion chambers as well as numerical simulations dealing with turbulent combustion suggest that @xmath75  is no longer an independent quantity @xcite .",
    "its local value self - adapts so that the effective burning rate is set by the integral length @xmath76  and the characteristic velocity , v , at the integral length - scale .",
    "such interesting behaviour relies in the existence of an universal scaling law for velocity spectrum of the type :    @xmath77    which for d=7/3 becomes the popular kolmogorov scaling - law for turbulence . adopting the scaling relationship given by equation 11 , both m@xmath78   as well as",
    "the mass of the k - isotope , m@xmath79  become independent of @xmath74 .",
    "the ejected mass of the k - isotope can therefore be calculated using the value of x@xmath79  computed in the previous section :    @xmath80    where @xmath81  is the elapsed time until the abundance of the respective nuclei freezes .",
    "for example , as stated in ",
    "2 the nuclear combustion is unable to synthesize nuclei beyond magnesium once the density has gone down @xmath82  . within our model of exponential density reduction",
    "this occurs once @xmath83 .",
    "admittedly , the above discussion is a little artificial , but necessary to develop the formalism , because finally neither v@xmath84  nor d appears in equation 12 . according to that equation the progression of the flame can be envisaged as a spherical flame front of radius @xmath85  moving not at the laminar speed but at velocity v. as v is expected to be many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath74  the synthesized mass of nickel as well as the released nuclear energy are sufficient to account for the supernova light curve and energetics .",
    "nevertheless a variation of the geometrical approach given by equation 12 could be more fruitful to address the particular problem of the synthesis of ime @xcite . in this regard",
    "it might be more physical to interpret @xmath85  as the average radius of the ashes , made basically of nuclear - statistical equilibrium elements ( nsee ) .",
    "the intermediate - mass elements are then produced in a tiny shell , almost a surface , on top of the huge volume defined by the underlying ashes , over a length given by the product v  @xmath86 . unlike the synthesis of nsee , which as bounded to a volume",
    "are reasonably given by equation 12 , surface effects are important to properly model the synthesis of ime . assuming that the effective surface of nsee behaves as a fractal in which those scale - lengths below the current thickness of the ime layer itself do not appreciably contribute to m@xmath2 , we can write :    @xmath87    which either for d=2 or for ( v  @xmath88  reduces to equation 12 . here",
    ", the fractal dimension @xmath89 is intended to describe the geometrical properties of the nsee external surface in between the integral length - scale and the radius of the front , and has not to be the same as the dimension @xmath90 characterizing the front at lower length - scales . finally , to compute m@xmath2  from equation 13",
    "it is more convenient to use the mass of the ashes made of nsee , @xmath91 , instead their average radius @xmath85 .",
    "then , solving for the integral , taking x@xmath2  from equation ( 9 ) and using @xmath83  the resulting expression is :    @xmath92    where @xmath93  is the average density of the ashes in @xmath94  g@xmath95@xmath17 and v@xmath96  the average velocity of the effective flame velocity in @xmath97  cm@xmath95s@xmath5 .",
    "the main results of a parametric exploration of equation 14 are depicted in figure 4 . in this figure",
    "there is shown the synthesized mass of elements between silicon to calcium as a function of the values adopted by the set \\{v@xmath96 , d , @xmath24}. in computing figure 4 we have taken a fixed mass of ashes @xmath99   and @xmath100 , a density which is slightly higher than the starting density during the exponential expansion",
    ". such combination of m@xmath101  and @xmath102  leads to an average radius of the ashes @xmath103  cm , in fair agreement to detailed hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "for instance , model w7 @xcite gives approximately @xmath104  at @xmath105   similar as the one adopted in this work .",
    "going to multidimensional models rpke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) give an average radius of the burnt zone also close to @xmath106  in their model c3_3d .",
    "first of all note that the case d=2 in figure 4 almost always leads to an underproduction of ime .",
    "thus it becomes clear why those one - dimensional models which assumed a spherical burning front moving at the largest turbulent speed , v , did not succeed in synthesizing large amounts of ime @xcite .",
    "also , there is not a sufficient abundance of ime neither for @xmath107  nor for @xmath108  s. the mass of these elements smoothly rises as d , v or @xmath24  increases , as expected .",
    "according to equation 14 the most influencial parameter affecting the nucleosynthesis of silicon family is the fractal dimension of the underlying iron core , followed by the propagation velocity and the characteristic expansion time respectively .",
    "there are , however , some limitations which could prevent a large production of ime during the explosion .",
    "first , the fractal dimension defining the ashes s surface is thought to be closer to 2.3 than to 2.5 because it is highly probable for turbulence to be of kolmogorov type .",
    "actually , one can expect that the flame behaves as a multifractal , so the effective fractal dimension would be somehow between 2.33 ( characteristic of lower scale - lengths ) and d=2.5 ( characteristic of large scale - lenghts ) .",
    "on the other hand the local sound speed puts an upper limit to the largest turbulent velocity v. at the densities of interest the sound speed is @xmath109  cm.s@xmath5  thus v@xmath1102 is almost a half of the sound speed . in that case the induction of a detonation because of the cumulative effect of pressure waves can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "maybe more interesting are the constraints related to the dominant combustion regime : flamelet or distributed . taking @xmath111  cm ,",
    "@xmath112  cm ( approximately the flame thickness at these densities ) , @xmath113  cm.s@xmath5   and d=7/3 in equation 11 the corresponding turbulent velocity is v@xmath114  cm.s@xmath5 . with that choice of parameters",
    "turbulent combustion will stay in the flamelet regime as long as the velocity of the largest eddy is lower than @xmath115  cm.s@xmath5 .",
    "were this the case an inspection of figure 4 reveals that , even in the most favourable case with @xmath51  s , the production of ime hardly arrives to 0.2m@xmath4 .",
    "considering stronger turbulent intensities would move the more plausible region for producing ime just to the poorly known distributive regime .",
    "the influence of the characteristic expansion time @xmath24  is not as strong as that of v@xmath96  owing to the inverse dependence of x@xmath2  with @xmath24  ( eq .",
    "moreover , one - dimensional simulations indicate that the characteristic expansion time at the time combustion arrives to layers with @xmath116  are probably not much larger than 0.2 s ( see for example fig .",
    "even though @xmath24  should be relatively model independent , owing the strong sensitivity of the degenerate matter against perturbations , its precise value is set by the central density at the moment of the explosion and by the nuclear combustion dynamics itself .",
    "equation 14 suggests that m@xmath2  and m@xmath101  are not independent quantities , m@xmath117  . on the other hand some mass of fe - peak elements",
    "are also produced simultaneously to silicon during the expansion .",
    "thus , the final quantity of fe - peak , @xmath118   is slightly higher than @xmath91 . assuming that after freezing is @xmath119  in the ime layer it is easy to show that the total mass of the iron group is :    @xmath120    a plot of @xmath121  versus @xmath118  for several characteristic expansion times at constant d=7/3 and v@xmath96=1.5 is given in figure 5 . as we can see the relationship between @xmath121  and @xmath118  is close to linear with increasing slope as @xmath24  rises . as a general rule",
    "we expect that deflagrations with large luminosities ( i.e a large mass of @xmath69ni ) will also show a large production of ime .",
    "nevertheless some attention has to be paid to the influence of the characteristic expansion time .",
    "for example , according to figure 5 , 0.2m@xmath4  of ime can be synthesized in combination to 0.7m@xmath4  of fe - peak elements at @xmath51  s or to 0.95m@xmath4  at @xmath38  s. hence explosions with different maximum luminosities and global energetics could lead to similar amounts of ime .",
    "moreover , it is reasonable to think that @xmath24  and m@xmath101   are inversely correlated : a large amount of m@xmath101  means a big deal of released nuclear energy thus leading to shorter characteristic expansion times .",
    "such correlation suggest that some self - regulating mechanism could be at work reducing the dispersion in the production of ime .",
    "finally , note that our assumption that ashes are enterily composed of nsee has not to be necessarily true . even though there is a current debate concerning this point ,",
    "recent multidimensional simulations indicate that some unburnt carbon and oxygen could remain mixed with the incinerated material , @xcite . in that case the correlation between the mass of ime and fe - peak elements will be different to that shown in figure 5 .",
    "the amount of intermediate - mass elements ejected in a snia explosion is an important diagnosing tool to discriminate between a variety of theoretical models attempting to explain the nature of such explosions .",
    "one of the most popular models is the deflagration model , rooted in the subsonic propagation of a nuclear flame through the white dwarf interior .",
    "however , with very few exceptions , neither the one - dimensional simulations nor modern three - dimensional calculations of this model have been able to give the right quantity of ime .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations always stubbornly give a too low production .",
    "this fact is currently attributed to the low resolution achieved in multidimensional calculations .    in the first part of this paper",
    "we have analyzed the synthesis of elements from helium to zinc during the propagation of a nuclear flame in an expanding background .",
    "the simulation was carried out in the planar aproximation , thus the resolution was enough to resolve the detailed structure of the flame . in this sense",
    "our work represents a continuation of that by timmes & woosley ( 1992 ) . as a result",
    "we were able to get an idea of the size of the region where the ime were for the most part synthesized : between 0.15 km to 0.75 km depending on the characteristic expansion time .",
    "this width is hardly reachable by today multidimensional hydrocodes .",
    "it was also possible to give the amount of elements from silicon to calcium cooked behind the flame ( table 1 ) .",
    "this information can be used by snia modelers to improve the nucleosynthesis output of their hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "an interesting result is that ime are massively produced in the range @xmath122  .",
    "in fact , according to our calculations 80% of the ime were already produced before the density declined below @xmath123  ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . this could have important consequences because the usefulness of our results strongly relies in the basic hypothesis that the flame does not enter the distributive regime above 2 - 3@xmath124  .",
    "finally useful fitting formulae giving the mass of ime synthesized during the expansion as well as to their mass fraction , x@xmath2 , as a function of the characteristic expansion time @xmath24  were also given ( eqs .",
    "8,9 ) .    in ",
    "3 we did use the information given in table 1 to estimate the quantity of ime ejected during the deflagration of a white dwarf taking advantage of the self - similar properties of the thermonuclear combustion in snia .",
    "we have taken a geometrical approach to address this problem in which the narrow region where the si - peak nuclei are typically produced was treated as a tiny shell wrapping around a deformed surface on top of a volume made of fe - peak elements .",
    "that approach holds as long as the ashes form a well defined and not too dispersed pack limited by an irregular surface . within our simple model the total amount of elements from silicon to calcium",
    "can be obtained from an analytical expression ( eq .",
    "14 ) which uses four parameters : the ratio between the mass and average density of the nse - ashes , the fractal dimension of their surface , the velocity of the turbulent combustion at the largest scales , and the characteristic expansion time . in consequence we have tried to delimitate the regions in parameter space able to give the amount of ime compatible with observations ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    as a general conclusion",
    "we state the difficulty of pure deflagration models to produce more than 0.2m@xmath4  of intermediate - mass elements . in this sense",
    "our phenomenological approach may help to understand why the underproduction of si - peak elements has traditionally been a long standing problem of all sort of hydrodynamical simulations concerning type ia supernovae assuming the deflagrative paradigma .",
    "still there remains a significant area in space parameter showing a rich production of ime .",
    "in particular the region defined by the unequalities @xmath3  s , @xmath125  and @xmath126  seems to be well suited for that purpose .",
    "the above lower limit in the fractal dimension of the ahes s surface does not pose a problem as experiments dealing with turbulent combustion indicates a favoured value of d close to 2.3 .",
    "as an aside , 1d simulations that always assume @xmath127 on the resolved length - scales lead unavoidably to an underproduction of ime .",
    "perhaps more demanding is the limitation imposed by the characteristic expansion time . even though @xmath24  should not be too different from the hydrodynamical time scale , @xmath128  s at the densities of interest , its particular value is model dependent .",
    "hence expansion times with @xmath129  s are probably not unrealistic .",
    "turbulent intensities characterized by @xmath126  are also reachable during the explosion because the rising velocity of the larger floating blobs of incinerated material is of the order , or even greater , than that velocity .",
    "nevertheless , the turbulent cascade generated by these fast moving blobs could fragment the flame in very small pieces , shorter than the flame thickness , invalidating our hypothesis that combustion always takes place in the flamelet regime .",
    "thus , although our main goal was to highlight the favoured regions in parameter space to synthesize a good deal of ime , the presented results also underline the potential importance of the distributed regime for deflagration models , if they were to represent the main channel to normal type ia supernovae .",
    "even if a large mass of ime were attained in deflagration models of snia , our study still suggests another potential problem : the production of ime seems to increase monothonically with that of fe - peak elements .",
    "hence , it would be seemingly difficult for deflagrations to explain peculiar low - luminosity but energetic events like sn1991bg or sn1998de @xcite .    this work was funded by spanish dgicyt grant aya2002 - 04094 and also supported by dursi of the generalitat de catalunya .",

    "<S> we have built a simple geometrical approach to model the region where ime are thought to be produced . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that a healthy production of ime involves the combination of not too short expansion times , @xmath3  s , and high turbulent intensities . according to our results </S>",
    "<S> it could be difficult to produce much more than 0.2 m@xmath4  of intermediate - mass elements within the deflagrative paradigma . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations also suggest that the mass of ime scales with the mass of fe - peak elements , making it difficult to conciliate energetic explosions with low ejected nickel masses , as in the well observed sn1991bg or in sn1998de . </S>",
    "<S> thus a large production of si - peak elements , especially in combination with a low or a moderate production of iron , could be better addressed by either the delayed detonation route in standard chandrasekhar - mass models or , perhaps , by the off - center helium detonation in the sub chandrasekhar - mass scenario . </S>"
