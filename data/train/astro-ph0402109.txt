    "in 1998 , some results based on supernovae ( sne ) type ia observations published independently by two different groups , drastically changed our view about the present state of the universe @xcite . in brief , the hubble - sandage diagram describing the observed brightness of these objects as a function of the redshift lead to unexpected and landmark conclusion : the expansion of the universe is speeding up not slowing down as believed during many decades .",
    "implicitly , such sne type ia observations suggest that the bulk of the energy density in the universe is repulsive and appears like a dark energy component ; an unknown form of energy with negative pressure [ in addition to the ordinary dark matter ] which is probably of primordial origin .",
    "0.05 in    in a more historical perspective , as the one shown in the chronological scheme above , one may say that contemporary cosmology started with the sne  experiments \" .",
    "the current expectation is that important clues to the emerging dark energy paradigm will be provided by the next generation of sne projects with advancing technology @xcite , as well as by a large set of complementary cosmological observations .",
    "the existence of an extra component filling the universe has also indirectly been suggested by independent studies based on fluctuations of the 3k relic radiation @xcite , large scale structure @xcite , age estimates of globular clusters or old high redshift objects @xcite , as well as by the x - ray data from galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "actually , the angular power spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) favors a model with total density parameter @xmath3 , a value originally predicted by inflation , whereas the density parameter associated with cold dark matter ( cdm ) is @xmath4 , a value independently required by the power spectrum of the large scale structure ( lss ) and x - ray data from galaxy clusters ( see scheme above ) .",
    "the difference @xmath5 is the density parameter of the dark energy component .",
    "such a picture has recently been confirmed with even more precision by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite , and all these ingredients together reinforce what is usually referred to as the standard concordance model of cosmology @xcite .",
    "0.1 in    although considering that dark energy changed the traditional view of the universe , the absence of natural guidance from particle physics theory about its nature gave origin to an intense debate , as well as to many theoretical speculations .",
    "in particular , a cosmological constant ( @xmath6 )  the oldest and by far the most natural candidate  is the simplest from a mathematical viewpoint but not the unique possibility .",
    "the @xmath6 term was originally introduced by einstein in 1917 to obtain a static world model .",
    "it is a time independent and spatially uniform dark component , which may classically be interpreted as a relativistic perfect simple fluid obeying the equation of state @xmath7 . in the framework of quantum field theory",
    "the presence of @xmath6 is due to the zero - point energy of all particles and fields filling the universe which manifests itself in several quantum phenomena like the lamb shift and casimir effect @xcite .",
    "however , there is a fundamental problem related to such a theoretically favored candidate which is usually called the cosmological constant problem .",
    "shortly , it is puzzling that the present cosmological upper bound ( @xmath8 ) differs from natural theoretical expectations ( @xmath9 ) by more than 100 orders of magnitude .",
    "this puzzle at the interface of astrophysics , cosmology , and quantum field theory has been considered by some authors as the greatest crisis of modern physics @xcite , and , as such , it acts like a damocles sword on the cosmological constant solution for the present accelerating stage of the universe .    nowadays",
    ", there are many other candidates appearing in the literature , among them :    \\(i ) a @xmath10-term , or a decaying vacuum energy density .",
    "\\(ii ) a relic scalar field ( sf ) slowly rolling down its potential .",
    "\\(iii )  x - matter \" , an extra component characterized by an equation of state @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "\\(iv ) a chaplygin - type gas whose equation of state is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a positive constant and @xmath15 .",
    "the list is by no means as exhaustive as one may think at first sight . since the basic condition for an accelerating universe is a dominant component with negative pressure , there are other possibilities which have occasionally been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "note also that the model dominated by cosmological constant ( @xmath16 ) is a limiting case of the x - matter parametrization ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the last three candidates above ( sf , x - matter , and chaplygin gas ) share an additional physical property , namely , the effective equation of state parameter ( @xmath18 ) may be a function of the redshift .",
    "in particular , this means that many different models may explain the same set of data .",
    "therefore , in order to improve our understanding of the nature of dark energy , an important task nowadays in cosmology is to find new methods or to revive old ones that could directly or indirectly quantify the amount of dark energy present in the universe , as well as determine its effective equation of state parameter .",
    "in other words , by learning more about the cosmic acceleration at low and high redshifts , one may expect to discriminate among the existing theories of dark energy by better determining @xmath19 and its time dependence .    in this short review",
    "we present a simplified picture of the main results and discuss briefly some difficulties of the emerging dark energy paradigm .",
    "since the consequences of a cosmological constant and a rolling scalar field ( usually considered the best candidates ) have already been extensively discussed in recent review papers @xcite , in the present work we emphasize only the main results related to the remaining dark energy candidates .",
    "in what follows we restrict our attention to the class of spacetimes described by the frw flat line element ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21   , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the scale factor .",
    "such a background is favored by the cosmic concordance model since it is a direct consequence of the recent cmb results ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "now , let us discuss the cosmic dynamics and some observational consequences for alternative dark energy candidates .",
    "* a. time - varying @xmath10-term *    decaying vacuum cosmologies or @xmath10 models @xcite are described in terms of a two - fluid mixture : a decaying vacuum medium ( @xmath23 ) plus a fluid component (  decaying vacuum products \" ) which are characterized by their energy density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 . historically , the idea of a time varying @xmath10-term was first advanced in the paper of bronstein @xcite .",
    "different from einstein s cosmological constant , such a possibility somewhat missed in the literature for many decades , and , probably , it was not important to the recent development initiated by ozer and taha at the late eighties @xcite .",
    "the einstein field equations ( efe ) and the energy conservation law ( ecl ) for @xmath10 models are :    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    where a dot means time derivative .",
    "it should be noticed that the ecl ( [ eq : ecl ] ) may be rewritten to yield an expression for the rate of entropy production in this model as @xmath29 showing that @xmath6 must decrease in the course of time , while the energy is transferred from the decaying vacuum to the material component ( for more details see @xcite ) .    at this point , we stress the difference between models with cosmological constant and a decaying vacuum energy density . in the later case , it is usually argued that the vacuum energy density is a time - dependent quantity because of its coupling with the other matter fields of the universe . by virtue of the expansion",
    ", one may suppose that the cosmological constant is relaxing to its natural value ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "broadly speaking , the main goal of such models is to determine how the energy that drove inflation at early stages , and accelerates the universe at present is related to the current small value of @xmath6 .",
    "sometimes the decaying vacuum energy density is assumed to be an explicit time decreasing function .",
    "however , in the majority of the papers , it depends only implicitly on the cosmological time through the scale factor ( @xmath31 ) or the hubble parameter ( @xmath32 , or even a combination of them @xcite .",
    "an extensive list of phenomenological @xmath6-decay laws can be seen in the paper by overduin and cooperstock @xcite .",
    "all these models have the same achilles heel : there is no lagrangian description including the coupling term ( nor any physical mechanism ) governing the energy change between the decaying vacuum and other matter fields .",
    "the expression defining @xmath10 is obtained either using dimensional arguments or in a completely ad hoc way . however , although essentially phenomenological , such an approach may indicate promising ways to solve the cosmological constant problem by establishing the effective regime to be provided by fundamental physics .",
    "certainly , one of the simplest possibilities for a decaying vacuum energy density is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the vacuum energy density , @xmath35 is the total energy density , and @xmath36 $ ] is a dimensionless parameter of order unity @xcite . by combining such a condition with the first efe equation one obtains the scaling law @xmath37 , a natural result from dimensional arguments . in this scenario ,",
    "the expansion may be accelerated as required by sne observations , and unlike the model proposed by ozer and taha @xcite and chen & wu @xcite for which @xmath31 , it solves the age problem at @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "0.1 in    from the observational viewpoint , @xmath10cdm models possess an interesting characteristic that may distinguish them from @xmath6cdm models . due to the possibility of an adiabatic photon production",
    "the standard temperature - redshift relation may be slightly modified . for a large class of models",
    "the temperature is given by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the temperature of cmb at @xmath41 .",
    "this expression implies that for a given redshift @xmath42 , the temperature of the universe is lower than in the standard photon - conserved scenario .",
    "although some recent determinations of @xmath43 ( based upon the @xmath44 , 1 , and 2 ground state fine - structure levels of ci ) have obtained values roughly consistent with the standard prediction , it is well known that such measurements must be taken as upper limits once many other excitations mechanisms may have contributed to the observed level populations . in particular , by considering collisional excitations , molaro _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found a temperature for the cmb of @xmath45 k at @xmath46 .",
    "this result implies @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "more stringent constraints are furnished by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "initially , birkel and sarkar @xcite obtained @xmath49 , whereas a slightly greater upper bound , @xmath50 , was further derived by lima et al .",
    "@xcite . in such analyzes",
    ", it was assumed that the @xmath51 parameter has the same value during the vacuum - radiation and vacuum - matter dominated epochs .",
    "probably , if one relaxes this hypothesis it will be much easier to satisfy the nucleosynthesis constraints and solve other cosmological problems .",
    "constraints from sne observations , angular diameter versus redshift relation , gravitational lensing and other kinematic tests ( assuming a constant @xmath51 parameter ) have been discussed by many authors @xcite .",
    "* b. x - matter *    in the cosmological scenarios driven by x - matter plus cold dark matter ( sometimes called xcdm parametrization ) both fluid components are separately conserved @xcite .",
    "the equation of state of the dark energy component is @xmath52 . unlike to what happens with scalar field",
    "motivated models where @xmath53 is derived from the field description @xcite , the expression of @xmath53 for xcdm scenarios must be assumed a priori .",
    "usually , it varies with some power of the redshift , say , @xmath54 .",
    "models with constant @xmath55 are the simplest ones and their free parameters can easily be constrained from the main cosmological tests .",
    "more recently , in order to detect the possibility of bias in the parameter determination due to the imposition @xmath56 , some authors have studied models with constant @xmath55 by considering two different cases : the standard xcdm ( @xmath12 ) and the _ extended _ xcdm ( also named `` phantom '' energy @xcite ) in which the @xmath19 parameter violates the null energy condition and may assume values @xmath57 . in the case of x - ray data from galaxy clusters , for instance , a good agreement between theory and observations for @xmath58 is possible if @xmath59 ( @xmath60 c.l . ) and @xmath61 @xcite .",

    "@xcite whereas for @xmath111 , the model behaves as @xmath6cdm .",
    "the idea of a unified dark - matter - energy ( udme ) scenario inspired by an equation of state like ( [ eq7 ] ) comes from the fact that the chaplygin type gas can naturally interpolate between non - relativistic matter and negative - pressure dark energy regimes @xcite . since in this approach",
    "there is only one dark component beside baryons , photons and neutrinos , some authors have termed this udme scenario as a quartessence cosmology @xcite .    motivated by these possibilities ,",
    "there has been growing interest in exploring the theoretical and observational consequences of the chaplygin gas , not only as a possibility for unification of the dark sector ( dark matter / dark energy ) but also as a new candidate for dark energy only .",

    "the search for cosmologies driven by dark energy is presently in vogue .",
    "the leitmotiv is the observational support for an accelerated universe provided by the type ia supernovae ( sne ) experiments at intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "this short review focused on some alternative candidates to dark energy .",
    "this ubiquitous component plus the dark matter are responsible for nearly 95% of the matter - energy content filling the universe .",
    "however , different from dark matter , the extra dark ( energy ) component is intrinsically relativistic and its negative pressure is required by the present accelerating stage of the universe .",
    "its tiny density and weak interaction presumably preclude the possibility of identification in the terrestrial laboratory . unfortunately , even considering that we are in the golden age of empirical cosmology , the existing data are still unable to discriminate among the different dark energy candidates , thereby signaling that we need better observations in order to test the basic predictions .",
    "this means that the determination of cosmological parameters will continue to be a central goal in the near future .",
    "the fundamental aim is to shed some light on the nature of the dark energy , but it is not clear if it can be revealed using background tests with basis only in a different equation of state . another possibility is to add some hypothesis concerning the nature itself ( is it formed by massive or massless particles ? ) , and to follow examining its consequences .",
    "it is also worth notice that the energy of this relativistic dark component grows in the course of an adiabatic expansion .",
    "macroscopically , the energy increases on account of the thermodynamic work done on the system ( negative pressure ) .",
    "this intriguing behavior is in marked contrast to what happens to any component with positive or null pressure .",
    "naturally , a possible microscopic explanation for such a fact is of great interest because it depends on the intrinsic nature of the dark energy , and may also have important consequences to the ultimate fate of the universe .    on the other hand , since the current models are more complicated than the einstein - de sitter universe , such a situation is somewhat uncomfortable either from theoretical or observational viewpoints .",
    "it has also to be admitted that none dark energy model has been successful enough to deserve the status of a  standard model \" .",
    "however , the present time for many cosmologists is very exciting because although preserving some aspects of the basic physical picture , the new invisible actor ( dark energy ) which has not been predicted by the standard model of particle physics , and is responsible for repulsive gravity , may alter profoundly the traditional view of space - time and matter .",

    "<S> a large number of recent observational data strongly suggest that we live in a flat , accelerating universe composed of @xmath0 1/3 of matter ( baryonic + dark ) and @xmath0 2/3 of an exotic component with large negative pressure , usually named * dark energy * or * quintessence*. the basic set of experiments includes : observations from sne ia , cmb anisotropies , large scale structure , x - ray data from galaxy clusters , age estimates of globular clusters and old high redshift galaxies ( ohrg s ) . </S>",
    "<S> such results seem to provide the remaining piece of information connecting the inflationary flatness prediction ( @xmath1 ) with astronomical observations . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , they have also stimulated the current interest for more general models containing an extra component describing this unknown dark energy , and simultaneously accounting for the present accelerating stage of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> an overlook in the literature shows that at least five dark energy candidates have been proposed in the context of general relativistic models . </S>",
    "<S> since the cosmological constant and rolling scalar field models have already been extensively discussed , in this short review we focus our attention to the three remaining candidates , namely : a decaying vacuum energy density ( or @xmath2 * models * ) , the * x - matter * , and the so - called * chaplygin - type gas*. a summary of their main results is given and some difficulties underlying the emerging dark energy paradigm are also briefly examined . </S>"
