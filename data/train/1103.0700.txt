    "the method of the generalized alignment indices ( galis ) was originally introduced in @xcite as an efficient chaos detection method . to date , the gali method has been successfully applied to a wide variety of conservative dynamical systems for the discrimination between regular and chaotic motion , as well as for the detection of regular motion on low dimensional tori @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we extend and complete the study of the gali method , focusing on its behavior for the special case of periodic orbits and their neighborhood in conservative dynamical systems .",
    "the detection of periodic orbits and the determination of their stability are fundamental approaches for the study of nonlinear dynamical systems , since they provide valuable information for the structure of their phase space .",
    "in particular , stable periodic orbits are associated with regular motion , since they are surrounded by tori of quasiperiodic motion , while in the vicinity of unstable periodic orbits chaotic motion occurs .    the gali method is related to the evolution of several deviation vectors from the studied orbit , and therefore is influenced by the characteristics of the system s tangent space .",
    "the main goal of the paper is to determine the usefulness of the method for probing the local dynamics of periodic orbits with different stability types .",
    "we manage to achieve this goal by deriving theoretical predictions for the behavior of galis for stable and unstable periodic orbits .",
    "we also verify numerically the validity of these predictions , by studying the evolution of galis for periodic orbits of several hamiltonian flows and symplectic maps , clarifying also the connections of such dynamical systems . in addition",
    ", we show how the properties of the index can be used to locate stable periodic orbits , and to understand the dynamics in the vicinity of unstable ones .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first two introductory sections we recall the definition of the gali , describing also its behavior for regular and chaotic orbits ( sect .",
    "[ sec : gali ] ) , and report the several stability types of periodic orbits in conservative systems ( sect .",
    "[ sec : stability ] ) . in sect .",
    "[ sec : g_po ] we first study theoretically the behavior of the index for stable and unstable orbits , and then present applications of the gali to particular orbits of hamiltonian flows and symplectic maps .",
    "[ sec : near ] is devoted to the dynamics in the neighborhood of periodic orbits , while sect .",
    "[ sect : perp_dev_vec ] is dedicated to the relation between the galis of stable periodic orbits for flows and maps . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize our results .",
    "let us briefly recall the definition of the galis and their behavior for regular and chaotic motion in conservative dynamical systems . consider an autonomous hamiltonian system of @xmath0 degrees of freedom ( @xmath0dof ) , described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the generalized coordinates and conjugate momenta respectively .",
    "an orbit in the @xmath5-dimensional phase space @xmath6 of this system is defined by a vector @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath4 .",
    "the time evolution of this orbit is governed by hamilton s equations of motion @xmath10 while the time evolution of an initial deviation vector @xmath11 from the @xmath12 solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hameq ] ) , obeys the variational equations @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the jacobian matrix of @xmath15 .",
    "let us also consider a discrete time @xmath16 conservative dynamical system defined by a @xmath5-dimensional ( @xmath5d ) symplectic map @xmath17 .",
    "the evolution of an orbit in the @xmath5-dimensional space @xmath6 of the map is governed by the difference equation @xmath18 in this case , the evolution of a deviation vector @xmath19 , with respect to a reference orbit @xmath20 , is given by the corresponding _ tangent map _",
    "@xmath21    for @xmath0dof hamiltonian flows and @xmath5d maps the generalized alignment index of order @xmath22 ( gali@xmath23 ) , @xmath24 , is determined through the evolution of @xmath22 initially linearly independent deviation vectors @xmath25 . to avoid overflow problems , the resulting deviation vectors @xmath26 are continually normalized , but their directions are kept intact .",
    "then , according to @xcite gali@xmath23 is defined as the volume of the @xmath22-parallelogram having as edges the @xmath22 unit deviation vectors @xmath27 , @xmath28 , determined through the wedge product of these vectors as @xmath29 with @xmath30 denoting the usual norm . from this definition",
    "it is evident that if at least two of the deviation vectors become linearly dependent , the wedge product in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gali ] ) becomes zero and the gali@xmath23 vanishes .    in the @xmath5-dimensional phase space @xmath6 of an @xmath0dof hamiltonian flow or a @xmath5d map , regular orbits lie on @xmath31-dimensional tori , with @xmath32 for hamiltonian flows , and @xmath33 for maps .",
    "for such orbits , all deviation vectors tend to fall on the @xmath31-dimensional tangent space of the torus on which the motion lies .",
    "thus , if we start with @xmath34 general deviation vectors , these will remain linearly independent on the @xmath31-dimensional tangent space of the torus , since there is no particular reason for them to become linearly dependent . as a consequence gali@xmath23 remains practically constant and different from zero for @xmath34 . on the other hand",
    ", gali@xmath23 tends to zero for @xmath35 , since some deviation vectors will eventually have to become linearly dependent . in particular , the generic behavior of gali@xmath23 for regular orbits lying on @xmath31-dimensional tori is given by @xcite @xmath36 note that these estimations are valid only when the conditions stated above are exactly satisfied .",
    "for example , in the case of 2d maps , where the only possible torus is an @xmath37-dimensional invariant curve , the tangent space is @xmath38-dimensional .",
    "thus , the behavior of gali@xmath39 ( which is the only possible index in this case ) is given by the third branch of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gali_order_all ] ) , i.e.  gali@xmath40 , since the first two cases of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gali_order_all ] ) are not applicable . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gali_order_all ] ) we deduce that , for the usual case of regular orbits lying on an @xmath0-dimensional torus , the behavior of gali@xmath23 is given by @xmath41    on the other hand , for a chaotic orbit all deviation vectors tend to become linearly _ dependent _ , aligning themselves in the direction defined by the maximum lyapunov characteristic exponent ( mlce ) and hence , in that case , gali@xmath42 tends to zero _ exponentially _ following the law @xcite @xmath43 t } , \\label{eq : gali_chaos}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 are the first @xmath22 largest lyapunov characteristic exponents ( lces ) of the orbit .",
    "the gali is a generalization of a similar indicator called the smaller alignment index ( sali ) @xcite , which has been used successfully for the detection of chaos in several dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the generalization consists in the fact that the galis use information of _ more than two _ deviation vectors from the reference orbit , leading to a faster and clearer distinction between regular and chaotic motion compared with sali . in practice , sali is equivalent to gali@xmath39 since @xmath45 ( see appendix b of @xcite for more details ) .    for the numerical computation of galis",
    "we consider the @xmath46 matrix @xmath47 having as rows the coordinates @xmath48 of the unit deviation vectors @xmath49 , @xmath28 , @xmath50 , with respect to the usual orthonormal basis @xmath51 , @xmath52 , ... , @xmath53 of the @xmath5-dimensional phase space @xmath6 .",
    "thus , gali@xmath54 can be evaluated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the determinants of all possible @xmath55 submatrices of @xmath56 @xcite @xmath57 here the sum is performed over all possible combinations of @xmath22 indices out of @xmath5 , @xmath58 denotes the determinant , and the explicit dependence of all quantities on the time @xmath59 is omitted for simplicity .",
    "equation ( [ eq : norm ] ) is ideal for the theoretical determination of the asymptotic behavior of galis for chaotic and regular orbits .",
    "it has been used in @xcite for the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gali_order_all ] ) and ( [ eq : gali_chaos ] ) , and will be applied later on in sect .",
    "[ sec : theory ] for the determination of galis behavior for periodic orbits .",
    "however , from a practical point of view the application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) for the numerical evaluation of gali@xmath23 is not very efficient as it might require the computation of a large number of determinants . in @xcite",
    "a more efficient numerical technique for the computation of gali@xmath23 , which is based on the singular value decomposition of matrix @xmath47 was presented . in particular , it has been shown that gali@xmath23 is equal to the product of the singular values @xmath60 , @xmath28 of @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the transpose matrix .",
    "now , consider a @xmath64-periodic orbit ( i.e.  an orbit satisfying @xmath65 ) of an @xmath0dof hamiltonian flow or of a @xmath5d symplectic map .",
    "its linear stability is determined by the eigenvalues of the so - called monodromy matrix @xmath66 , which is obtained from the solution of the variational equations for one period @xmath64 ( see for example @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.3)@xcite ( * ? ?",

    "\\label{eq : w_ham_t}\\ ] ]    due to the symplectic nature of the monodromy matrix and the fact that its elements are real , the eigenvalues of @xmath66 have the following property : if @xmath74 is an eigenvalue then @xmath75 and the complex conjugate @xmath76 are also eigenvalues .",
    "this property shows that the eigenvalues @xmath77 and @xmath78 come in pairs and that complex eigenvalues with modulus not equal to 1 always appear in quartets .",
    "when all eigenvalues are on the unit circle the corresponding periodic orbit is said to be _",
    "stable_. if there exist eigenvalues off the unit circle the periodic orbit is _",
    "unstable_.    a few remarks on the connection of hamiltonian systems with symplectic maps are necessary at this point .",
    "since autonomous hamiltonian systems are conservative , the constancy of the hamiltonian function introduces a constraint which fixes an eigenvalue of the monodromy matrix to be equal to 1 and so , by the symplectic property , there must be a second eigenvalue equal to 1 .",
    "thus , for an @xmath0dof hamiltonian system there are only @xmath79 a priori unknown eigenvalues , and so we can reduce our study to a @xmath79-dimensional subspace of phase space @xmath6 .",
    "this subspace is obtained by the well - known method of the poincar surface of section ( pss ) ( e.g.  @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 , 3.2 ) ) .",
    "the corresponding monodromy matrix of the periodic orbit is also symplectic .",
    "thus , in this sense , an @xmath0dof hamiltonian system is dynamically equivalent to @xmath79d symplectic map .",
    "the different stability types of a periodic orbit in hamiltonian systems of 2dof and 3dof ( or equivalently in 2d and 4d maps ) have been studied in detail in @xcite , while the stability of periodic orbits in higher dimensional conservative systems was considered in @xcite . following the terminology introduced in @xcite , the general stability type of a periodic orbit of an @xmath0dof hamiltonian system , or equivalently a @xmath79d map ,",
    "is denoted by @xmath80 which means that @xmath81 couples of eigenvalues are on the unit circle , @xmath82 couples are on the real axis and @xmath83 quartets are on the complex plane but off the unit circle and the real axis .",
    "we conclude that a periodic orbit is stable only when its stability type is @xmath84 . in all other cases",
    "the orbit is unstable since there exist eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix off the unit circle .",
    "for example , in the case of a 3dof hamiltonian system or a 4d map a periodic orbit can be linearly stable ( @xmath85 ) or have three different types of instability : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( often called simple unstable , double unstable and complex unstable respectively , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "unstable periodic orbits of non - integrable hamiltonian systems and symplectic maps are located inside chaotic domains .",

    "[ ham_neighupo ] we show two such examples . in particular , we consider a chaotic orbit of the 2dof hamiltonian system ( [ 2dhh ] ) , whose initial condition is located close to an unstable periodic orbit of period 7 with initial condition @xmath268 ( fig .  [ ham_neighupo](a ) ) , and an orbit of the 3dof system ( [ 3dham ] ) whose initial condition is near the @xmath86 periodic orbit presented in sect .",

    "[ ham_neighupo ] we observe an oscillatory behavior of gali@xmath39 , similar to the one shown in fig .  [ neighupo](a ) .",

    "in sect .  [ sec : stability ] we discussed the dynamical equivalence between @xmath0dof hamiltonian systems and @xmath79d maps , as the latter can be interpreted as appropriate psss of the former .",
    "we have also seen that galis behave differently for flows and maps . in particular , as was shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : g_po ] , they remain constant for stable periodic orbits of maps ( see eq .",

    "the fact that maps can be considered as pss of flows , however , is the key to understanding this difference .",
    "so , computing the restriction of the galis on the pss of a hamiltonian system , or more generally on spaces perpendicular to the flow , should lead to behaviors of the indices similar to the ones obtained for maps .",

    "we explained how , the fact that galis attain larger values _ near _ stable periodic orbits than _ on _ the periodic orbits themselves , can be used to identify the location of these orbits .",
    "we also observed a remarkable oscillatory behavior of the galis associated with the dynamics close to unstable periodic orbits and explained it in terms of the stable and unstable manifolds of the periodic orbit , showing how the influence of these manifolds can lead to large variations of the gali values by many orders of magnitude .",
