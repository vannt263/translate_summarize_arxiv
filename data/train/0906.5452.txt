    "an important step in our proof is lemma  [ l:2chains ] , essentially implying that if the distance between @xmath19 and the farthest point of a convex chain from @xmath19 is `` large '' , then the chain can not be too long .",
    "conditioning on the location of this farthest point would allow an elegant conditional expectation argument .",
    "however , fixing the farthest point modifies the underlying probability space and therefore the estimate coming from lemma  [ l:2chains ] is no longer valid . to eliminate this difficulty , we chose to define finitely many subcases and",
    "estimate them separately , which can also be considered as a finite approximation of the continuous conditional expectation .",
    "in the final section we summarize the observations obtained by computer simulations .",
    "the search for the longest convex chains can be accomplished by an algorithm which has running time @xmath539 .",
    "this algorithm works as follows .",
    "we order the points by increasing @xmath186 coordinate , and then recursively create a list at each point . the @xmath142th element on the list at point",
    "@xmath487 contains the minimal slope of the last segment of chains starting at @xmath10 and ending at @xmath487 whose length is exactly @xmath142 , and a pointer to the other endpoint of this last segment . for creating the list at the next point @xmath487",
    ", we have to search the points before @xmath487 , and see if @xmath487 can be added to the chains while preserving convexity .",
    "this algorithm can be speeded up with some ( not fully justified but useful ) tricks .",
    "first of all , theorem  [ limsh ] guarantees that we have to search only among the points close to @xmath19 .",
    "the simulations show that most longest convex chains are located in a small neighbourhood of @xmath19 , whose radius is in fact of order approximately @xmath540 , much smaller than the width of order @xmath541 given by theorem  [ limsh ]",
    ". therefore the search can be restricted to a subset of the points with cardinality of order @xmath542 .",
    "second , when looking for the longest chain , we have to search only points relatively close to @xmath487 , and chains which are already relatively long , thus reducing memory demands .",
