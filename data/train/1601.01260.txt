    "the global properties of our universe are very well described by a @xmath0 model with a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric within the context of the general theory of relativity . to explain structure formation after decoupling of matter and radiation in this model , one has to assume that before decoupling cold dark matter ( cdm ) has already contracted to form seeds into which the baryons ( i.e. , ordinary matter ) could fall after decoupling . in this article",
    "it will be shown that cdm did not contract faster than baryons before decoupling and that structure formation started off successfully only after decoupling .    in the companion article",
    "refer to sections and equations in the companion article  @xcite . ]",
    "it has been shown that there are two unique gauge - invariant quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are the real , measurable , perturbations to the energy density and the particle number density , respectively .",
    "evolution equations for the corresponding contrast functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 have been derived for closed , flat and open flrw universes . in this article",
    "these evolution equations will be applied to a flat flrw universe in its three main phases , namely the radiation - dominated era , the plasma era , and the epoch after decoupling of matter and radiation . in the derivation of the evolution equations , an equation of state for the pressure of the form",
    "@xmath5 has been taken into account , as is required by thermodynamics . as a consequence , in addition to a usual second - order evolution equation ( [ sec - ord ] ) for density perturbations , a first - order evolution equation ( [ fir - ord ] ) for entropy perturbations follows also from the perturbed einstein equations .",
    "this entropy evolution equation is absent in former treatments of the subject .",
    "therefore , the system ( [ subeq : final ] ) leads to further reaching conclusions than is possible from treatments in the literature .",
    "analytic expressions for the fluctuations in the energy density @xmath3 and the particle number density @xmath4 in the radiation - dominated era and the epoch after decoupling will be determined .",
    "it is shown that the evolution equations ( [ subeq : final ] ) corroborate the standard perturbation theory in both eras in the limiting case of _",
    "infinite_-scale perturbations . for _ finite _ scales , however , the differences are conspicuous . therefore , only finite - scale perturbations are considered in detail .",
    "a first result is that in the radiation - dominated era oscillating density perturbations with an _ increasing _ amplitude proportional to @xmath6 are found , whereas the standard perturbation equation ( [ eq : delta - standard ] ) yields oscillating density perturbations with a _ constant _ amplitude .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that in the perturbation equations ( [ subeq : final ] ) the divergence @xmath7 of the spatial part of the fluid four - velocity is taken into account , whereas @xmath7 is missing in the standard equation . in the appendix",
    "it is made clear why @xmath7 is important .    in the radiation - dominated era and the plasma era baryons",
    "were tightly coupled to radiation via thomson scattering until decoupling .",
    "a second result is that cdm was also tightly coupled to radiation , not through thomson scattering , but through _",
    "gravitation_. this implies that before decoupling perturbations in cdm have contracted as fast as perturbations in the baryon density . as a consequence , cdm",
    "could not have triggered structure formation after decoupling .",
    "this result follows from the entropy evolution equation ( [ fir - ord ] ) since @xmath8 , ( [ eq : part - p ] ) , throughout the history of the universe as will be shown in section  [ sec : analytic - sol ] .    from observations  @xcite of the cosmic microwave background",
    "it follows that perturbations were adiabatic at the moment of decoupling , and density fluctuations @xmath3 and @xmath4 were of the order of @xmath9 or less .",
    "since the growth rate of _ adiabatic _ perturbations in the era after decoupling was too small to explain structure in the universe , there must have been , in addition to gravitation , some other mechanism which has enhanced the growth rate sufficiently to form the first stars from small density perturbations . a final result of the present study is that it has been demonstrated that after decoupling such a mechanism did indeed exist in the early universe .    at the moment of decoupling of matter and radiation , photons could not ionize matter any more and the two constituents fell out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "as a consequence , the pressure dropped from a very high radiation pressure just before decoupling to a very low gas pressure after decoupling .",
    "this fast and chaotic transition from a high pressure epoch to a very low pressure era may have resulted in large relative _ diabatic _ pressure perturbations due to very small fluctuations in the kinetic energy density .",
    "it is found that the growth of a density perturbation has not only been governed by gravitation , but also by heat exchange of a perturbation with its environment .",
    "the growth rate depended strongly on the scale of a perturbation . for perturbations with a scale of @xmath10 ( see the peak value in figure  [ fig : collapse ] ) gravity and heat exchange worked perfectly together , resulting in a fast growth rate .",
    "perturbations larger than this scale reached , despite their stronger gravitational field , their non - linear phase at a later time since heat exchange was low due to their larger scales . on the other hand , for perturbations with scales smaller than @xmath11 gravity was too weak and heat exchange was not sufficient to let perturbations grow .",
    "therefore , density perturbations with scales smaller than @xmath11 did not reach the non - linear regime within @xmath12 , the age of the universe .",
    "since there was a sharp decline in growth rate below a scale of @xmath11 , this scale will be called the _ relativistic jeans",
    "scale_.    the conclusion of the present article is that the @xmath0 model of the universe and its evolution equations for density perturbations ( [ subeq : final ] ) explain the so - called ( hypothetical ) population  iii stars and larger structures in the universe , which came into existence several hundreds of million years after the big bang  @xcite .",

    "it is generally assumed that if the energy density is dominated by non - relativistic particles , so that @xmath102 , and if the linear scales involved are small compared with the characteristic scale @xmath295 of the universe , then one may safely use the newtonian theory of gravity to study the evolution of density perturbations .",
    "the perturbation equations of the ( newtonian ) jeans theory adapted to an expanding universe after decoupling are given by weinberg  @xcite , equations ( 15.9.12)(15.9.16 ) .",
    "substituting @xmath296 , @xmath297 and @xmath298 in these equations and taking the divergence of ( 15.9.13 ) , one arrives at the newtonian equations in the notation used in the present article :    [ subeq : mukhanov - textbook ] @xmath299    where the energy conservation law ( [ frw2 ] ) with @xmath102 has been used . differentiating ( [ muk1 ] ) with respect to time and eliminating @xmath300 with the help of ( [ muk2 ] ) and , subsequently , eliminating @xmath7 and @xmath301 with the help of ( [ muk1 ] ) and ( [ muk3 ] ) , respectively , yields @xmath302     \\delta = 0,\\ ] ] which is precisely the standard equation ( [ eq : delta - standard ] ) for @xmath102 and @xmath108 .    since the newtonian theory of gravity is invariant under the gauge transformation ( [ eq : gauge - trans - newt ] )",
    ", one has @xmath303 , just as in the relativistic case ( [ subeq : algemene - vergelijkingen - mat - dom ] ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath281 is a physical quantity . from equation ( [ muk1 ] ) it follows that @xmath243 is also a physical quantity .",
    "therefore , one is tempted to conclude that the standard equation ( [ eq : delta - standard - dust ] ) is free from spurious gauge modes , so that @xmath237 would describe the evolution of density perturbations correctly .",
    "this would imply that @xmath283 is a _ physical _ solution of the newtonian equation ( [ eq : delta - standard - dust ] ) , notwithstanding the occurrence of the gauge constant @xmath280 .",
    "this discrepancy will be discussed in the next section .      in section  [ app : gtr ]",
    "it has been shown that the left - hand side of the standard equation ( [ eq : delta - standard ] ) follows from the general theory of relativity . in section  [ app : newton ] the newtonian theory of gravity has been used to derive the standard equation for @xmath102 and @xmath228 given by ( [ coef - nu1 ] ) .    in the radiation - dominated phase of the universe , the energy density and pressure of the universe is described by relativistic equations of state ( [ eq : state - rad ] ) .",
    "consequently , ( [ eq : delta - standard ] ) is in this case a relativistic equation which has no newtonian equivalent .",
    "therefore , its general solution is of the form ( [ eq : mode - mix ] ) with @xmath285 , ( [ eq : gauge - modes - standard ] ) , the non - physical gauge mode .",
    "after decoupling of matter and radiation the matter content of the universe can be described by non - relativistic equations of state ( [ state - mat ] ) . in this case , the velocities of the particles are low and the scale of a perturbation is small . according to the literature , it would , therefore , be feasible to derive an evolution equation for density perturbations using the newtonian theory of gravity , if one takes the expansion of the universe into account .",
    "the result is equation ( [ eq : delta - standard - dust ] ) .",
    "again , the general solution of ( [ eq : delta - standard - dust ] ) is of the form ( [ eq : mode - mix ] ) .",
    "since there is no gauge problem in the newtonian theory , the solution @xmath283 would be a _ physical _ solution .",
    "however , equation ( [ eq : delta - standard - dust ] ) can also be derived from the general theory of relativity , as follows from the derivation of ( [ subeq : algemene - vergelijkingen - mat - dom ] ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath283 is a gauge mode which has no physical significance whatsoever . as a consequence , the newtonian perturbation equation ( [ eq : delta - standard - dust ] ) contradicts the relativistic perturbation equation ( [ eq : alg - mat - dom - delta ] ) .",
    "however , the general theory of relativity is superior to the newtonian theory of gravity",
    ". therefore , @xmath285 is indeed a gauge mode , as will now be explained . in the non - relativistic limit",
    "the _ relativistic _ gauge transformation @xmath304 reduces to the _ newtonian _ gauge transformation ( [ eq : gauge - trans - newt ] ) .",
    "this implies that the general solution @xmath243 of the homogeneous part of the relativistic equation ( [ eq : alg - mat - dom - delta ] ) is gauge - dependent also in the newtonian theory of gravity .",
    "consequently , the newtonian equation ( [ eq : delta - standard - dust ] ) has a non - physical gauge mode as solution . in other words ,",
    "the fact that @xmath243 is gauge - dependent in the general theory of relativity implies that @xmath243 is also gauge - dependent in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "that is why the gauge - invariant quantities  ( 40a@xmath18 ) @xmath305 which are shown  @xcite to be the unique , real and measurable energy density perturbation and particle number density perturbation , can _ not _ become equal to the gauge - dependent quantities @xmath113 and @xmath234 in the non - relativistic limit , since the latter two quantities are still gauge - dependent in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "as has been shown in section  4@xmath18 , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 become equal to their newtonian counterparts in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "this demonstrates that there is indeed no gauge problem in the newtonian theory of gravity , since @xmath1 and @xmath2 are invariant under the gauge transformation ( [ eq : gauge - trans - newt ] ) of the newtonian theory .    since the jeans perturbation theory adapted to a non - static universe yields non - physical solutions",
    ", it should be concluded that the newtonian theory of gravity is inadequate to study the evolution of density perturbations in a _ non - static _ universe .",

    "<S> firstly , in the radiation - dominated era small - scale perturbations grew proportional to the square root of time . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , perturbations in the cold dark matter particle number density were , due to gravitation , coupled to perturbations in the total energy density . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that structure formation could have begun successfully only after decoupling of matter and radiation . finally , after decoupling density perturbations evolved diabatically , i.e. , they exchanged heat with their environment . </S>",
