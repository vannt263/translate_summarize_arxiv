    "the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are a small group of isolated , young neutron stars having x - ray luminosities greater than their rotational energy loss rates .",
    "they are believed to be magnetars , neutron stars possessing @xmath410@xmath5 g magnetic fields , with x - ray emission powered by the decay of their superstrong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the magnetar nature of axps has been strongly supported by their high spin - down rates and similar radiative properties to soft gamma repeaters , including short x - ray bursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bursting activity likely reflects structural changes in the surface magnetic field of a magnetar .    as the brightest and nearest among the currently known axps , 4u",
    "0142@xmath061   has been well studied over wavelength ranges from the x - ray to mid - infrared ( mir ) .",
    "its x - ray emission in the 0.510 kev range can be well described by a blackbody ( @xmath6= 0.5 kev ) plus power law ( photon index @xmath7 = 3.4 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , which is believed to arise from the surface and magnetosphere of the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "its optical emission is pulsed at the 8.7-s spin period ( @xcite ) and appears to have a power - law  like spectrum @xcite , likely also originating from the magnetosphere ( although no apparent connection can be established between the optical and x - ray spectra ) .",
    "a surprise came from the detection of the source in the mir ( 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m ) , which revealed a rising spectrum from the near - ir ( nir ) to mir @xcite .",
    "the detection can be interpreted as a surrounding debris disk @xcite .",
    "the putative disk , presumably formed from fallback material after the supernova explosion , is irradiated by the x - rays from the central pulsar and emits mainly in the mir .",
    "the existence and appearance of such a disk has been predicted ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , optical / nir flux variability from 4u  0142@xmath061  has been reported @xcite . in a total of only 9 observations ,",
    "significant flux variations were detected , suggesting such variability is very common .",
    "this variability is intriguing , since no such flux changes have been detected in x - rays , even though x - ray observations of the source have been made much more frequently than the optical / nir observations .",
    "an obvious question is whether there is similar variability in the mir .",
    "rapid variability in the mir would be very hard to understand in the disk model in the absence of x - ray variability .",
    "on 2007 february 7 , a large fast - rise x - ray burst was detected during the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) monitoring observations of 4u  0142@xmath061  @xcite .",
    "the peak flux of the burst was more than two orders of magnitude larger than that in the source s quiescent state .",
    "this event provided an opportunity to test the fallback disk model , since a mir flux increase is expected from an x - ray irradiated disk when the input x - ray flux is increased ( see figure [ fig : disk ] ) .",
    "for the purposes of searching for variability and testing the fallback disk model , we observed 4u  0142@xmath061   with the _ spitzer space telescope_. in this paper , we report on the results of the observations .",
    "we observed 4u  0142@xmath061   four times in 2007 february 1421 with _ spitzer _ , following the february 7 burst . to catch flux variations from the source and possibly constrain their time scale ,",
    "the observations were scheduled to be on days 2 , 4 , and 7 after the first observation .",
    "the exact observation dates are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the imaging instrument used was the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) .",
    "it operates in four channels at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m , while two adjacent fields are simultaneously imaged in pairs ( 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath1 m ; 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "we observed our target in the 4.5 ( bandwidth 1.0 @xmath1 m ) and 8.0 @xmath1 m ( bandwidth 2.9 @xmath1 m ) channels .",
    "the detectors at the short and long wavelength bands are insb and si : as devices , respectively , with 256@xmath8256 pixels and a plate scale of 12 .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) is 52@xmath852 .",
    "the frame time was 100 s , with 96.8 and 93.6 s effective exposure time per frame for the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m data , respectively .",
    "the total exposure times in each observation were 19.4 min at 4.5 @xmath1 m and 18.7 min at 8.0 @xmath1 m .",
    "we also obtained the previous _",
    "spitzer _",
    "irac data of 4u  0142@xmath061   from the _ spitzer _  archive .",
    "the observation was made on 2005 january 17 at the same wavelength bands as ours .",
    "the effective exposure times were 77.4 and 74.9 min in the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "the results from this observation were previously reported by @xcite .",
    "the raw image data were processed through the irac data pipelines ( version s15.3.0 ) at the _",
    "spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) . in the basic calibrated data ( bcd )",
    "pipeline , standard imaging data reductions , such as removal of the electronic bias , dark sky subtraction , flat - fielding , and linearization , are performed and individual flux - calibrated bcd frames are produced . in the post - bcd ( pbcd ) pipeline , radiation hits in bcd images are detected and excluded , and bcd frames are then combined into final pbcd mosaics . the detailed data reductions in the pipelines can be found in the irac data handbook ( version 3.0 ; @xcite ) . for our 2007 data , the target s nearby region in the 4.5 @xmath1 m images suffered the  column pull - down \" effect , an artifact in which a column of the detector array has a reduced intensity when a place in the column reaches a level of approximately 35000 digital numbers ( dns ) due to a bright star or cosmic rays .",
    "we corrected the bcd images for the artifact by using the tool cosmetic.pl .",
    "the artifact - corrected bcd images were then combined into pbcd mosaics by using the tool mosaic.pl .",
    "both tools are provided by ssc in the mopex package . in our pbcd data processing , the latest june 2006 permanently damaged pixels mask ( pmask ) image , provided by ssc , was used .",
    "the target field in the 4.5 @xmath1 m pbcd images is crowded .",
    "we used dophot @xcite , a point - spread function ( psf ) fitting program , for photometry .",
    "for the 8.0 @xmath1 m images , in which the sky background dominates in brightness and varies substantially over the source field region , we found that aperture photometry provided more consistent measurements ( this was also suggested by the _ spitzer _",
    "helpdesk ) .",
    "the program phot in the iraf package apphot was used for photometry .",
    "the aperture radius was 3 pixels and background annulus radii were 37 pixels .",
    "the dophot results were also corrected to this aperture set @xcite .",
    "the correction factor was derived by comparing the brightnesses resulting from the psf - fitting photometry to those from the aperture photometry of a few well exposed , isolated stars in the source field .",
    "in addition , to eliminate systematic variations among the pbcd images that might be caused by changes such as in the instrument , observing conditions , or data reduction , we applied a differential photometry technique : we calibrated the brightness of our target with those of an ensemble of bright , non - variable stars in the images .",
    "the base images were the 2005 data , which have longer exposure times and thus higher signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the flux density measurements are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "as can be seen , the flux densities are consistent with being a constant within the uncertainties .",
    "no significant variations were detected from our observations . compared to the 2005 flux densities , the upper limits ( 90% confidence ) on the flux density changes are 13% at 4.5 @xmath1 m and 38% at 8.0 @xmath1 m .",
    "we note that the flux densities in table  [ tab : obs ] for the 2005 observation are slightly lower than those previously reported , 36.3@xmath23.6 and 51.9@xmath25.2 @xmath1jy at 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m , respectively @xcite .",
    "for the 4.5 @xmath1 m results , the difference is mainly caused by blending with nearby stars .",
    "a few photons from nearby stars appear within 23 pixels radii from the center of our target . when aperture photometry was used ( in @xcite ) , the extra photons were included as the target counts .",
    "this can be verified by comparing the measurements from aperture photometry to those from psf - fitting .",
    "for example , when an aperture radius of 3 pixels is used , the ratio between the fluxes from the first and latter photometry is 1.42@xmath20.09 for our target , while the average ratio is 1.214@xmath20.008 for a few non - blended test stars in the field . when the aperture radius is changed to 2 pixels , the flux ratios for our target and the test stars are equal ( 1.07@xmath20.07 for the target versus 1.070@xmath20.008 for the test stars ) .",
    "for the 8.0 @xmath1 m results , the difference , which is well within the uncertainties , is probably due to the different irac data pipelines [ version s11.0 in @xcite versus s15.3.0 in this work ] .",
    "we average the four 2007 4.5 @xmath1 m fluxes , weighted by the flux uncertainties , and find a mean of 32.1@xmath21.2 @xmath1jy .",
    "this value is exactly the same as the 2005 result ( note that the total exposure time in each wavelength band of the 2007 observations is approximately the same as that of the 2005 observation ) . adding a 5% absolute calibration uncertainty in quadrature ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we obtain 32.1@xmath22.0 @xmath1jy .",
    "the 8.0 @xmath1 m flux densities , as shown in table  [ tab : obs ] , have similar uncertainties , even though the exposure time of the 2005 observation is four times that of one 2007 observation .",
    "this is because the flux density uncertainties are dominated by the sky noise ( e.g. , @xcite ) and there were intrinsic intensity variations within the sky annulus in the aperture photometry .",
    "therefore , the longer 2005 exposure time did not effectively reduce the sky noise .",
    "we average the four flux densities and find an average of 59.8@xmath28.5 @xmath1jy , where we use the uncertainty 8.0 @xmath1jy ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) and add the 5% absolute calibration uncertainty to it in quadrature .",
    "there are a total of 11 reported @xmath9-band observations of 4u  0142@xmath061  in the past 9 years , and three of them were with simultaneous @xmath10 observations @xcite . in the observations , the axp exhibited large and rapid flux variations in the @xmath9 band , and",
    "the @xmath10 fluxes correlated with the @xmath9 but varied less .",
    "assuming that the @xmath9-band variations are sufficiently sampled , the probability of seeing a @xmath1115% flux change would be 60% .",
    "in one extreme case , a 40% @xmath9 flux decrease occured within one day .",
    "our _ spitzer _",
    "observations were planned so that such strong variability would have been detected .",
    "correlated flux changes between the mir and @xmath9 bands are expected in the proposed dust disk model for 4u  0142@xmath061  ( figure  [ fig : disk ] ; @xcite ) , if x - ray flux changes are considered as the primary cause of the variability .",
    "we did not detect the @xmath9-like flux variations in our mir observations .",
    "spitzer_/irac fluxes were consistent with being a constant within the uncertainties . given that the upper limit on the mir 4.5 @xmath1 m flux variations was @xmath12% , the mir emission variability was similar to the nir @xmath10 bands and less variable than in the @xmath9 band .",
    "we note that in a @xmath9-band observation made one day prior to our first _",
    "spitzer _",
    "observation , the source had @xmath13 mag @xcite , approximately the average @xmath9 magnitude of 4u  0142@xmath061 . because the time scale of the @xmath9 flux variations is not determined",
    ", this could suggest that the source was in a stable state in the nir during our observations , which could be a reason for the absence of mir variability . to further constrain the relation between the mir and nir emission , frequent",
    ", simultaneous observations are needed .",
    "if the mir emission is truly less variable , the restricted @xmath9-band variability would demand explanation .",
    "interestingly , similar nir variability is seen in a few dust disk systems around young stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in those systems ,",
    "the variability has been suggested to be caused by structural changes of the inner disk . if this is the case for 4u  0142@xmath061 , the properties in the source s ir variability might be explainable . since emission in the @xmath9 band",
    "would mainly arise from the inner edge of the disk and thus be more sensitive to inner disk changes , it would vary more strongly than emission in the @xmath10 and _ spitzer _  mir bands .",
    "it is not clear what would be the cause of the structural changes in the disk in 4u  0142@xmath061 .",
    "one possibility is variable x - ray heating , such as due to burst - related x - ray brightening .",
    "however , no significant short - term flux variations have been found in the x - ray observations of the source @xcite , and thus far only a few bursts have been found in bi - weekly _ rxte _ x - ray monitoring observations @xcite , indicating infrequency of the burst events .",
    "thus in the absence of x - ray variability , the @xmath9-band variability challenges the dust disk model @xcite .",
    "in addition , we did not detect any significant mir flux changes from 4u  0142@xmath061   in our _ spitzer _  irac observations following the large x - ray burst .",
    "the 4.5/8.0 @xmath1 m fluxes were nearly the same as those obtained in 2005 .",
    "as demonstrated by x - ray observations of the source that were made several days prior to our first _ spitzer _",
    "observation ( gonzalez et al . 2007 ) , the axp unfortunately had already returned to quiescence during our observations .",
    "also as shown in the long - term x - ray monitoring observations , the quiescent x - ray flux of 4u  0142@xmath061   has been nearly constant and stable over the past decade ( @xcite ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore",
    ", our non - detection is consistent with the source s state at x - ray energies at the time .",
    "we thank the _ spitzer _ science center for granting us the observations and the helpdesk at _ spitzer _ science center for help with data reduction and analysis .",
