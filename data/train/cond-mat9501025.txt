    "<S> we consider the problem of the statistics of the scattering matrix @xmath0 of a chaotic cavity ( quantum dot ) , which is coupled to the outside world by non - ideal leads containing @xmath1 scattering channels . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath2 of the quantum dot is assumed to be an @xmath3 hermitian matrix with probability distribution @xmath4^{-(\\beta m + 2 - \\beta)/2}$ ] , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are arbitrary coefficients and @xmath7 depending on the presence or absence of time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this `` lorentzian ensemble '' agrees with microscopic theory for an ensemble of disordered metal particles in the limit @xmath8 , and that for any @xmath9 it implies @xmath10 is the ensemble average of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this `` poisson kernel '' generalizes dyson s circular ensemble to the case @xmath11 and was previously obtained from a maximum entropy approach . </S>",
    "<S> the present work gives a microscopic justification for the case that the chaotic motion in the quantum dot is due to impurity scattering . </S>"
