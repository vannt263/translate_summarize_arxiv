    "due to the ever growing quantity of high resolution data , in the last few years great interest has been focused on the central region of galaxies where various phenomena co - exist .",
    "thanks to the high resolution images provided by the hubble space telescope , it is clear , nowadays , that the nuclei of the majority of both elliptical and early type spiral galaxies ( @xmath2m@xmath1 ) harbour massive or supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , whose masses , @xmath3 , range in the @xmath4m@xmath1 interval and may be up to @xmath5 m@xmath1 as in the case of the smbh in ngc1277 @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the central smbh is surrounded by a massive , very compact , star cluster commonly referred as nuclear star cluster ( nsc ) .",
    "nscs are observed in galaxies of every type of the hubble sequence @xcite and their modes of formation and evolution are still under debate . in the case of elliptical galaxy hosts ,",
    "the nuclear clusters are also referred to as resolved stellar nuclei. for the sake of this paper we will refer to nscs or resolved stellar nuclei indifferently .",
    "nscs are sited at the photometric and kinematic centre of the host galaxy , i.e. at the bottom of the potential well @xcite .",
    "this is likely connected to a peculiar formation history . as a matter of fact",
    ", all nscs contain an old stellar population ( @xmath6 gyr ) and most of them show , also , the presence of a young population , with ages below @xmath7 myr @xcite .",
    "nscs are bright ( about 4 mag brighter than ordinary globular clusters ) , massive objects ( @xmath8 m@xmath1 ) , very dense and with a half - light radius of @xmath9 pc .",
    "their small sizes and large masses make them the densest stellar systems in the universe @xcite .",
    "the relation between nscs and smbhs is poorly known ; they seem to be two faces of the same coin , constituting central massive objects ( cmos ) whose actual presence depends on the host mass : galaxies with mass above @xmath10 m@xmath1 usually host an smbh while lighter galaxies have , instead , a well resolved central star cluster ( an nsc ) .",
    "moreover , a transition region exists for galaxies with mass between @xmath11 and @xmath10 m@xmath1 in which both the objects co - exist @xcite .    with regard to the lack of evidence of nscs in high mass ( @xmath12 m@xmath1 ) galaxies",
    ", one possible explanation is the formation of giant ellipticals through merging of smaller galaxies @xcite .",
    "quantitatively speaking , @xcite simulations showed that if the two colliding galaxies host mbhs , a black hole binary ( bhb ) could form which heats up the resulting stellar nucleus causing its progressive evaporation .",
    "this process can destroy the super cluster , shaping significantly the density profile of the merger product and leaving behind a bhb that shrinks due to gravitational wave emission leading eventually to a smbh .",
    "another possibility is that in the early phase of the galaxy life , an initial nsc could be the seed for the bh birth as suggested first by @xcite and later by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of researchers studied the existence of scaling relations between nscs and their galactic hosts ; similar studies have already been done , seeking for scaling relations between smbhs and their hosts .",
    "however , it is still unclear the robustness of the nsc - galaxy relations and whether these relations are linked to those between smbhs and the hosts .    for instance",
    ", @xcite showed that the nsc mass ( @xmath13 ) vs galaxy velocity dispersion ( @xmath14 ) relation is roughly the same of that observed for smbhs .",
    "on the other hand , more recent studies @xcite claim that the @xmath15 relation is shallower than for smbhs , @xmath16 . moreover , it has been shown that while smbh masses correlate with the galaxy mass , the nsc masses correlate better with the bulge mass @xcite .",
    "at present , two are the most credited frameworks for the nsc formation .",
    "one scenario refers to the so called ( dissipational ) in - situ model @xcite .    according to this model , an injection of gas in the central region of a galaxy hosting a seed black hole could lead to the formation of a nsc if the typical crossing time of the parental galaxy is shorter than the so - called salpeter time , which is the time - scale over which the central bh can grow by accretion @xcite .",
    "another ( dissipationless ) scenario invokes the action of the dynamical friction process which makes massive globular clusters ( gcs ) sink toward the centre of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "their subsequent merging leads to a super star cluster with characteristics indistinguishable from those of an nsc @xcite .",
    "this scenario is often referred to as infall - merger scenario or migratory - merger model .",
    "both the theories above encounter some troubles in explaining completely the nsc formation . according to some qualitative considerations",
    ", the in situ model would predict too massive nscs , while a possible problem for the gcs infall model is that it would give lighter nscs than observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite say that mergers of star clusters are able to produce a wide variety of observed properties , including densities , structural scaling relations , shapes ( including the presence of young discs ) and even rapid rotation , nonetheless claim that some kinematical properties of observed nscs are hardly compatible with merger models .",
    "they suggest the need of a 50@xmath17 of gas in the overall scheme .",
    "@xcite referring to their fornax acs survey and to some speculative considerations conclude that , for galaxies and nuclei in their sample , the infall formation mechanism is the more likely for low to intermediate mass galaxies while for more massive ones accretion triggered by mergers , accretions , and tidal torques is likely to dominate .",
    "the two mechanisms smoothly vanish their efficiency on the intermediate mass galactic range , and they indeed provide some evidence of `` hybrid nuclei '' which could be the result of parallelly acting formation mechanisms .    while the in - situ model has remained , so far , almost speculative and difficult to constrain to available observations , several authors provided detailed numerical tests for the gc merger scenario starting from the original idea in @xcite .",
    "the first simulations were done by @xcite and @xcite in galaxy models without massive black holes and stellar discs ; @xcite studied the role of stellar discs and @xcite the role of a central galactic mbh .",
    "in particular , @xcite made a full @xmath18-body simulation of the decay and merging of 12 gcs in a milky way model accounting for the presence of the sgr a * @xmath19 m@xmath1 central black hole , obtaining an nsc that has global properties fully consistent with those observed in the nucleus of our galaxy .",
    "one recent work by @xcite presents the same merger simulations performed in @xcite with the inclusion of different stellar populations in the various infalling globular clusters , and shows that infalling clusters can produce thick flattened structures with varied orientations , possibly related to disky structures that are observed in galactic nuclei and clusters ( see @xcite for a discussion of the evolution of such discs ) .    on another side , @xcite ,",
    "by mean of a semyanalytical model , made some comparisons among the expexcted result of a merger scenario for the nsc formation and some scaling laws .",
    "the aim of this paper is to check in a more complete and extensive way the reliability of the infall - merger model for the nsc formation .",
    "to reach this aim we build theoretical scaling laws connecting nsc properties with those of the galactic hosts in a synthetic modelization of the global evolution of a globular cluster system ( gcs ) in a galaxy , considering the dynamical friction and tidal disruption as evolutionary engines .",
    "these scaling laws are to be compared with those observationally obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ dynfri ] the role of dynamical friction is discussed as well as the way we modeled galaxies and their gcs ; in the same section the sample of data used for the comparison with observation is presented ; section [ appro ] presents two different theoretical modelizations of the nsc growth in galaxies ; in section [ laws ] we provide a set of theoretical scaling laws which connect nscs with their hosts and compare them with the observed laws ; in section [ tid ] , instead , we take into account the effect of tidal disruption of gcs on the resulting nsc mass .",
    "finally , section [ end ] is devoted to a summary of the main results , providing some general remarks such to draw conclusions .",
    "the formation of a compact nucleus in the centre of a galaxy through the orbital decay of globular clusters has been discussed , first , by @xcite . working on a model of the m31 galaxy",
    ", they demonstrated that the efficiency of the dynamical friction mechanism could provide an amount of matter sufficient to form a compact nucleus of @xmath20m@xmath1 in the centre of this galaxy .",
    "@xcite turned out the importance of considering the tidal disruption of the clusters as a competitive process that tunes the effect of dynamical friction . before",
    "approaching in a deeper way the theme , we now give a relevant analytical support to the idea that a nsc can grow in the centre of a galaxy by mean of gc decay in the innermost region via dynamical friction braking .      a direct and easy way to obtain a scaling between the mass accumulated to the galactic centre and the background velocity dispersion",
    "is based on the assumption that the galaxy has the mass density of a singular isothermal sphere    ( r)= ,    where @xmath21 is the gravitational constant , @xmath22 is the galactocentric distance and @xmath23 is the circular velocity , constant with radius and related to the velocity dispersion , @xmath14 , by @xmath24 .",
    "approximating the motion of the test mass , @xmath25 , as a decreasing energy sequence of circular motions , the evolution equation of the modulus of the orbital angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath26 , is    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the absolute value of the dynamical friction force exerted by the galaxy on the test object , which , using the chandrasekhar s formula in its local approximation , is given by    @xmath29    with    @xmath30    where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 for a singular isothermal sphere ) , @xmath33 is the usual error function and @xmath34 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "the time evolution of the radius @xmath35 of the nearly circular orbit of the test mass under the previous assumptions is thus governed by the differential equation    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , which , with the initial condition @xmath38 , is easily integrated to give    @xmath39    and leads to @xmath40 as fully decay time ( @xmath41 ) of the object of mass @xmath25 initially moving on the circular orbit of radius @xmath42 ..    given , for the gc population , a density distribution in the form of a power - law    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is an a priori free parameter and @xmath45 is a normalization constant constrained to give the total mass of the gcs , @xmath46 :    @xmath47    assuming the total gcs mass to be a fraction @xmath48 of the galactic mass @xmath49 ,    @xmath50    @xmath45 turns out to be a function of the galactic velocity dispersion and radius    @xmath51    if the gcs dynamically decayed to the galactic centre go to grow a nucleus therein , the value of the nucleus mass at any age , @xmath52 , of the galaxy can be obtained by mean of @xmath53 , which is the maximum radius of the gc circular orbit decayed to the centre within time @xmath52 .",
    "consequently , @xmath54 , is simply    @xmath55    for @xmath56 , while @xmath54 saturates to @xmath46 at @xmath57 .    note",
    "that equation [ mnt ] is independent of the galactic radius @xmath58 and reduces to the @xmath59 relation obtained by @xcite in the case of @xmath60 , i.e. for gc distributed the same way as the galactic isothermal background .",
    "this is the only case where the dependence on @xmath58 cancels out . if , instead , @xmath61 the dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath14 becomes , in the assumption of a virial relation between galactic @xmath58 and @xmath49 ( @xmath62 )    @xmath63    which corresponds , assuming a constant @xmath64 , to a slope in the range from @xmath65 of the steeper ( @xmath66 ) gcs radial distribution to @xmath67 of the flat ( @xmath68 ) distribution .",
    "the relevant result here is that the slope of the @xmath69 relation in the regime of dynamical friction dominated infall process is expected to have an upper bound in any case smaller than that of the @xmath70 relation .",
    "the aim of this work is to show that the dry merger scenario can reproduce the correlations of observed nscs with their hosts in a wide range of galaxy masses . to reach this aim ,",
    "we need three important ingredients : i ) a robust data base to compare our results with real observations of nscs and their hosts , ii ) a reliable treatment of the dynamical friction and tidal disruption processes and iii ) a detailed model for the host galaxies to reproduce the environment in which gcs evolve .",
    "the data base for the purposes of this work has been extracted from three different papers .",
    "the first ( @xcite , hereafter eg12 ) , combines data coming from different works covering galaxies of the hubble types s0-sm ; on another side , @xcite ( hereafter lkb12 ) provide data for @xmath71 early type galaxies in the advanced camera virgo cluster survey @xcite ; finally , we considered data given in @xcite ( hereafter sg13 ) which is a collection of data from earlier works .    at the end",
    ", we gathered a total sample of @xmath72 galaxies covering a wide range of hubble types which contains several structural parameters of each galaxy such as mass , effective radius , velocity dispersion , and of the nsc masses .    to evaluate reliably the dynamical friction braking of gcs in their host galaxies",
    ", we have to assume galactic density profiles . as first approximation , we modeled galaxies as spherically symmetric distributions in the form of dehnen s spheres",
    "whose density is :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is linked by    @xmath76    to the total mass of the galaxy , @xmath49 and to its length scale , @xmath77 .    generally , galaxies fainter than @xmath78 show steep surface luminosity profiles @xmath79 with slope @xmath80 ( power - law galaxies ) , while brighter galaxies show less pronounced cusps ( core galaxies with @xmath81 ) @xcite .",
    "the two slopes , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , are linked by the relation @xmath84 in the case @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "consequently , for each galaxy mass @xmath49 , the @xmath83 exponent is randomly chosen in the range @xmath86 for @xmath87 m@xmath1 , and in the range @xmath88 for @xmath89 m@xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , since the slope of the @xmath90 depends critically on the surface brightness profile and may vary from different kind of galaxies , we allowed also the @xmath83 parameter to vary in a more general way , i.e. extracting it randomly between @xmath91 for each galaxy model , finding not significant changes in our results .",
    "for this reason , we decide to choose @xmath83 in the two ranges explained above , in agreement with the fact that brighter galaxies seems to have flatter surface brightness profiles .",
    "it is relevant noting that the validity of true cuspidal density profile models to describe the matter distribution of galaxies has been questioned by many authors that claim that the core - srsic profiles are better suited to describe the innermost ( @xmath92 to @xmath93 arcsecs ) regions of early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that power - law and core galaxies show more or less the same steepness of the density profiles in their outer regions , with small changes of the slope of the surface brightness profiles .",
    "since we are interested in the study of the dynamics of stellar clusters on a relatively large scale of the galaxy and not in its innermost region , where the investigation required a specific , more accurate modelling which is out of our scopes , we consider the simple @xmath83 density profiles as appropriate for our purposes .",
    "this choice allows us to use the results on dynamical friction recently obtained for cuspy dehnen s profile @xcite .",
    "actually , dehnen s profiles have a central cusp , and it has been demonstrated that the in density cusps the classical chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula fails ( see for instance @xcite ) . in particular , both @xcite and @xcite found that dynamical friction braking is reduced in the vicinity of a mbh . to overcome this problem , @xcite provided a formulation for the dynamical friction process which is valid in cuspy galaxies , giving a useful fitting expression for the dynamical friction timescale ( @xcite , equation 21 ) :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the orbital eccentricity of the text object of mass @xmath25 and @xmath96 is a normalization factor whose value is given by :    @xmath97    where @xmath77 ( in @xmath98 ) is the scale radius and @xmath99 the total mass of the @xmath83 model galaxy in unit of @xmath100 . equation [ tdf ]",
    "gives the dynamical friction decay time for a gc of mass @xmath25 initially moving on an orbit of eccentricity @xmath101 in a spherical galaxy of mass @xmath49 and length scale @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath102 depends , other than on @xmath95 , on @xmath49 , @xmath77 and @xmath83 , to a good estimate of the dynamical friction time reliable values of these three parameters are needed . in other words , it is important providing reliable models of the parent galaxy to ensure that the environment where dynamical friction acts is well reproduced .",
    "the simplest way to produce such model environments is via linking the parameters needed to establish the theoretical model to the observable quantities .",
    "as example , the lkb12 data sample contains the mass , @xmath49 , and effective radius , @xmath103 , which is the radius containing half of the total light .",
    "this parameter is important because it can be connected with the scale radius of the theoretical @xmath83 model , @xmath77 .",
    "however , the data sample contains a limited number of galaxies in the range @xmath104m@xmath1 and does not provide data for heavier galaxies , hence only a small fraction of the total range of galaxy masses could be investigated and , moreover , not always both the @xmath64 and @xmath105 values are available .",
    "to overcome these limitations , we need to extend with some proper extrapolations to a range of galaxies covering a wider , @xmath106m@xmath1 , mass interval . to this aim , we used data in lkb12 to correlate the galaxy mass with the effective radius and found a good fitting formula linking these two quantities as :    @xmath107    where @xmath49 is in units of @xmath108m@xmath1 .",
    "then , given the galaxy mass we can evaluate its own effective radius , which is an astrophysical observable , and , finally , we get the scale length @xmath109 by mean of these two relations @xcite :    @xmath110    @xmath111}.      \\label{rh}\\ ] ]    the first one being valid in the range of @xmath83 considered in this paper .",
    "finally , the scale length @xmath109 is related to @xmath83 and @xmath64 by this relation    @xmath112    in figure [ mre ] the above @xmath113 curve is drawn together with observed data taken from lbk12 .     estimated with equation [ effec].,width=321 ]    on the other hand , to give an estimate of the total radius of the galaxy we developed the following relation :    @xmath114    which allows us to obtain total radii for our galaxy models going from few @xmath98 for dwarf galaxies to several @xmath98 for giant ellipticals , and give us an estimate of the maximum distance from the galactic centre allowed as initial position for the clusters .",
    "as example , for a galaxy mass @xmath115m@xmath1 we obtain a radius @xmath116 , that is a reasonable value for such galaxies ( the supergiant elliptical galaxy m87 has a radius @xmath117 , comparable to this value ) .",
    "the other important parameter that we used to compare our galaxy models with real galaxies is the velocity dispersion , @xmath118 .    following lbk12 , to evaluate @xmath118 we used the formula given in @xcite : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the baryonic mass fraction assumed @xmath121 as in lbk12 .",
    "again , for any given galaxy mass , we selected randomly the parameter @xmath83 in the ranges explained above .",
    "the comparison between @xmath118 vs @xmath49 in lbk12 with our estimate is shown in figure [ msig ] .",
    "figures [ mre ] and [ msig ] convince us that we modeled the hosts sufficiently well to obtain reliable estimation of df times and , as a consequence , reliable values of the nsc masses .",
    "several authors had pointed out that the correlation between the bulge and the nsc mass is more dispersed than the @xmath122 relation @xcite .",
    "this is also related to the fact that many galaxies are actually bulgeless systems .",
    "since the sample of galaxies we used as reference contains also early and late - type spirals , we decided to evaluate the bulge mass for our systems by using the correlation bulge - host given in eg12 : @xmath123 this allows us to sample bulges in good agreement with the observed values for spiral galaxies , as it is shown in figure [ bulga ] , and it is still coherent to describe the mass of the stellar spheroid in ellipticals and dwarf spheroidal galaxies , where the spheroid mass is indistinguishable from the whole galaxy mass .",
    "another fundamental ingredient in this framework is the globular cluster system ( gcs ) total mass .",
    "a lower limit to the gcs mass can be obtained considering that the ratio between the gcs mass and the galaxy mass goes from @xmath124 for small galaxies ( @xmath125 m@xmath1 ) , up to @xmath126 for the largest ( @xmath49 up to @xmath127 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "this suggests a weak correlation between the gcs initial mass and the galaxy mass ; a good fit formula to this correlation is :    @xmath128    @xcite pointed out that the number of gcs in a given galaxy correlates with the galaxy mass through the relation : @xmath129 this relation can be rewritten properly to describe the relation between the galaxy mass and the gcs mass : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the mean value of the gc mass in the galaxy . allowing a mean value of @xmath132m@xmath1 for the gc masses , we recover a similar expression to equation [ mgcs1 ] .",
    "due to that smaller galaxies host light globulars ( @xmath133 m@xmath1 ) , while in heavier galaxies the globulars masses range in the @xmath134 m@xmath1 interval @xcite , we set the minimum and maximum value of the gc mass as a function of the galaxy mass :    @xmath135    as we will show in section [ stat ] , this choice gives mean gc masses in good agreement with observations .",
    "a sufficiently accurate estimate of the nsc mass accumulated to the centre of the galaxy in the merger scenario may be given by means of the following considerations .",
    "letting @xmath136 be the ( infinitesimal ) number of gcs with mass in the @xmath137 $ ] range and in the volume @xmath138 centred at @xmath139 , the total mass of the gcs is :    @xmath140    where @xmath141 and @xmath142 indicate , respectively , the lower and upper value for the gc mass and @xmath143 is the volume occupied by all the gcs . keeping a sufficient level of generality",
    ", we can assume @xmath144 in the form of the product of a function of @xmath25 and a function of @xmath22 :    @xmath145    where @xmath146 is a normalization constant given by    @xmath147    with @xmath148 the total number of clusters in the galaxy .",
    "a suitable expression for the mass function , @xmath149 , is a ( truncated ) power - law ( see for instance @xcite ) : @xmath150    on the other hand , the distribution of radial positions is , in principle , arbitrary .",
    "the simple inversion of equation [ tdf ] yields the maximum radius , @xmath151 , which contains all the clusters with mass @xmath152 and with initial eccentricity @xmath153 that have been confined around the galactic centre in a time @xmath154 :    @xmath155    with @xmath156 .",
    "consequently , an estimate of the nsc mass as a result of the accumulation of gcs to the galactic centre , caused by dynamical friction , is :    @xmath157    with @xmath158 given by : @xmath159    let us now consider two different radial distributions for the gc population : a generic power - law distribution , @xmath160 , and a @xmath83 model density law ( equation [ dhn ] )",
    ".    in the first case , equation [ mgcsmax ] reduces to : @xmath161 with @xmath18 the total number of clusters in the galaxy .    by substitution of this relation into equation [ mnsct ]",
    "we obtain :    @xmath162    with @xmath163 .    where @xmath164 and @xmath165 is a function of @xmath166 and @xmath52 whose explicit expression is : @xmath167    after integration , equation [ mnsc ] yields @xmath168    looking at equation [ tan ] , it is evident now the dependence of the nsc mass from the @xmath169 parameter , i.e. from the steepness of the density profile .",
    "the more general case in which we consider a @xmath83 density law , instead , will be discussed in the appendix .      allowing @xmath170 to vary in equation [ tan ]",
    "we estimate the mass of the nscs for different values of the slope of the gcs mass function @xmath171 at varying the galaxy mass in the range @xmath172$]m@xmath1 .",
    "equation [ tan ] allows us to see how the nsc mass increase as a function of time .",
    "figure [ growth ] shows the nsc growth as a function of time in the case @xmath173 for two extreme values of the galaxy mass ( @xmath174 and @xmath127 m@xmath1 ) and three values of @xmath171 considering the mass function in equation [ imf ] , i.e. @xmath175 with @xmath141 and @xmath142 as defined by equation [ m2 ] .",

    "we refer to the model @xmath178 as the combination ( @xmath193 ) .    in this context , it is relevant noting that the mass distribution of young luminous clusters ( often referred to as ylcs ) in many galaxies is a power - law with a spectral index ranging between @xmath195 and @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "assuming such power - law as initial mass function for a gcs , @xcite showed that the evolution of such a system in a model of our galaxy , leads to a final mass function for the gcs in agreement with the actual mass function of the milky way gcs , giving us some confirmation about the choices made to model gcss .",

    "the idea behind this statistical approach is sampling the initial gcs of a given galaxy , and evaluate how many gcs sink toward the galactic centre within a hubble time . a statistical estimate of the expected nsc mass is thus obtained by making @xmath196 realizations of the gcs of a galaxy , in order to give constraints to the error .",
    "each galaxy was modeled as explained in section [ model ] , while , for each cluster , we sampled its initial radial position , @xmath42 , and orbital eccentricity , @xmath95 , from a random , flat distribution .    from this gcs sampling",
    "we infer two relevant parameters to compare with observations .",
    "the first is the mean value of the gc mass for any given host mass , that can be compared with data given in lkb12 ; the second parameter is the number of survived clusters , which goes from few ( @xmath197 ) gcs for small galaxies ( @xmath198m@xmath1 ) , to few hundreds in intermediate mass galaxies , and up to @xmath199 in giant ellipticals .",
    "the relatively strong dependence of the df braking time on the individual gc mass ( see equation [ tdf ] ) deserves a careful treatment in the gc sampling , as explained in detail here below .",
    "as mentioned above , in this section we give estimate of the expected nsc mass for a given galaxy mass , sampling the whole gcs of the galaxy and looking at which clusters can sink toward the galactic centre within a hubble time . since initial position , eccentricity of the orbits and mass of each cluster are fundamental parameters in the evaluation of the decay time ( see equation [ tdf ] ) , we vary the sampling method for the gcs , changing spatial distribution and mass function of the clusters as explained in the following .",
    "this model ( referred to as pls model ) is characterized by a flat spatial distribution of gcs within the radial range @xmath200 $ ] , with @xmath58 the maximum distance defined in equation [ rtot ] ; their eccentricities are sampled randomly between @xmath65 and @xmath201 .",
    "gc masses are distributed according to a power - law distribution , @xmath202 .",
    "pls is , actually , the statistical version of the analytical treatment ( see section [ ana ] ) . when @xmath203 ( flat mass distribution ) we refer to as the random sampling model , called rnd .      in the gss model",

    ", we truncated the gaussian at a low mass @xmath206m@xmath1 and at a high mass @xmath207m@xmath1 .      there is no compelling evidence that the gcs and stars of the parent galaxy followed , initially , different density profiles , so we found worth examining the case where the initial gcs density profile is the same @xmath209 profile of the parent galaxy .",
    "the quality of our gc sampling can be tested by a comparison of the gcs mean masses obtained , @xmath210 , with data given in lkb12 .",
    "looking at figures [ mgc ] , we see that gss and rho models give a decent agreement with observations in the whole range of masses covered by the data available ; on the other hand , the rnd model seems to overestimate the mean gc mass , while the pls model gives an underestimate for host masses above @xmath211 .",
    "+       another relevant quantity obtainable with this approach is the number of survived \" clusters , which can be compared with the actually observed clusters . in figure [ srv ] the fraction of decayed clusters as a function of the hosting galaxy mass",
    "moreover , figure [ srv2 ] shows also the number of decayed clusters .",
    "it should not surprise that for sufficiently massive galaxies ( @xmath89m@xmath1 ) the number of survived gcs can exceed @xmath199 .",
    "many massive galaxies actually host such large populations of clusters .",
    "as example , the giant elliptical galaxy m87 ( also known as virgo a , with a mass @xmath212 m@xmath1 @xcite hosts about @xmath213 clusters , in agreement with our prediction .    on the other hand , the small number of gc expected in galaxies with @xmath214m@xmath1 , could provide a possible explanation for the lack of nucleated region in dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "in fact in such small galaxies , only few clusters are expected to form , this would imply that the formation of a nsc , at least in the framework of the dry - merger scenario , depends strongly on the initial conditions of each cluster of the galaxy .",
    "fluctuations in this low number statistics , together with the low mass of gcs in these environments ( and so long dynamical friction times ) make the probability of finding nscs in the center of these small hosts very low .",
    "figures [ tdfdist ] show the ratio between the df decay time and the hubble time for gcs belonging to a galaxy of mass @xmath215m@xmath1 whose gcs is sampled with the pls , rnd , gss and rho models .",

    "as we said in the introduction , the existence of correlations and scaling relations between the central compact object and the galactic host parameters may be an important clue to the understanding of the actual mechanisms of cmo formation .",

    "however , it is still unclear what , if any , the two different types of cmos have in common , so to imply an intimate link between central galactic bhs and nscs growth and evolution . actually , differences in scaling relations of bhs respect to nscs are being presently debated . as an example",
    ", @xcite claimed that nscs follow the same mass - sigma relation of massive central bhs , which is a power law with an exponent between @xmath219 and @xmath220 . on the other side , @xcite and @xcite",
    "find a significantly shallower relation for the mass-@xmath14 relation of nscs , with the exponent in the range @xmath221 to @xmath92 .    at this regard",
    ", while the in situ `` model is compatible with the steeper relation found in @xcite ( see for example @xcite ) , the dry merger '' scenario , instead , fits well with the @xcite and @xcite relations , as we have seen in section [ teo ] of this work ( see also @xcite ) .    by means of both the statistical and the analytical approaches presented above we can draw various correlations , including @xmath122 as well as @xmath222 and @xmath223 relations . at this scope , in figure [ mnscsig ] and figure [ mnscmb ] we report , respectively , the nsc masses as functions of the host galaxy velocity dispersion and bulge mass of our models compared with observed data .",
    "note that due to the somewhat ill definition of the bulge , the relation @xmath13 vs @xmath224 is not very reliable .",
    "it has been shown that the nsc mass correlates better with the total galaxy mass , while the correlation with the bulge is not statistically very significant @xcite .",

    ", we note that the fig .",
    "16 of @xcite paper shows a relevant feature that nsc formation model should interpret .",
    "on one side it gives evidence that much of the mass of nsc is in old stars ( thing straightforwardly compatible with the merger model ) ; on the other side , it seems to indicate the presence of older star population in more massive nscs .",
    "this is not at odd with the merger model .",
    "actually , there is evidence of the presence of a certain fraction of young stars in nscs ( see for instance the milky way nsc ) and this implies that some star formation occurred there in relatively recent imes from some gas there present . given this ,",
    "if we assume that the quantity of newly born ( in situ ) stars is the same in different , increasing in mass , galaxies hosting more massive nscs , it comes back naturally that these more massive nscs are , indeed , more massive because grown by a larger quantity of mass in decayed globular clusters which , consequently , have an increasingly old stellar population inside , due to the increased number fraction of old to young stars .",
    "anyway , this is only a speculation that deserves a deeper investigation .",
    "in the previous sections we showed that the dry - merger scenario provides scaling relations connecting the nsc masses with global parameters of their hosts . however , there are at least two effects which could prevent the formation of nscs , acting in competition with the dynamical friction process : the two - body relaxation mechanism and the tidal heating process . in this section",
    "we study their effects on the formation of nscs and show that the scaling laws derived in this case still agree with observations in the whole range of galaxy masses .    in the last section",
    ", we neglected the effect of the disruption of cluster since , as we will show in this section , in small galaxies ( @xmath229m@xmath1 ) the dominant process in the formation of the galactic nucleus is the dynamical friction process , while in heavier galaxies tidal processes could prevent its formation .    during its lifetime ,",
    "a gc undergoes internal dynamical evolution experiencing two - body relaxation and suffering of external tidal perturbations that , in some cases , can lead to its total , or partial , dissolution .",
    "actually , it is well known that two - body encounters between stars may bring some of them beyond the gc tidal boundary after few hundred times the typical two - body relaxation time @xcite .",
    "@xcite , using results by @xcite , gave the following formula for the evaluation of the dissolution time of a cluster due to the effects of two - body encounters :    @xmath230    where @xmath25 is the gc mass , @xmath22 is the distance from the galactic centre , @xmath23 the circular velocity at @xmath22 , and @xmath95 the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "moreover , gravitational encounters between the stellar system and a perturber ( which could be a black hole ) , the disc , or the nucleus , of the galaxy , could lead to the destruction of the system over a time comparable to the dynamical friction decay time .",
    "this implies that the phenomenon of cluster destruction can not be neglected . in the case",
    "in which the perturber is a point mass , a black hole , @xcite studied the effect of such perturbation on a stellar system of mass @xmath231 , in the hypothesis that the duration of the encounter is short compared to the internal crossing time of the cluster .",
    "this is the impulse approximation , which assumes that as a consequence of the encounter , stars in the perturbed system suffer only a change in their velocities , but not in the positions .",
    "moreover , due to the slow duration of the perturbation , the cluster trajectory can be approximated with a straight line . under this hypothesis ,",
    "it is possible to show that the cluster , as a consequence of the gravitational encounter with the perturber of mass @xmath232 , gains an energy per unit mass : @xmath233    where @xmath143 is the relative velocity between the two objects , @xmath228 is the impact parameter and @xmath234 is the mean dimension of the perturbed cluster .    a number of studies have been devoted to generalize this result to an extended spherical perturber with an arbitrary mass distribution @xcite , and to the case where the perturber is a spherical nucleus of stars embedded in a triaxial ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "defining @xmath235 the ratio between the impulsive energy change due to a perturber of half mass radius @xmath236 and that caused by a point of same mass , @xmath232 , the total change in energy per unit mass caused by a mass distribution is given by :    @xmath237    where the function @xmath235 drops rapidly to @xmath65 when @xmath238 approaches zero , while tends to @xmath201 for large values of @xmath238 and should be evaluated numerically .",
    "if the energy change exceeds the internal gravitational energy of the system per unit mass @xcite : @xmath239 the cluster is disrupted .",
    "the typical time over which this disruption occurs is @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the orbital period of the cluster and @xmath169 is the number of encounters within a period .",
    "further , the encounters are charcterized by two extreme regimes : the catastrophic regime , if a single encounter could disrupt completely the system , and the diffusive regime , when the cumulative effect of encounters leads to the disruption of the system over a longer time . defining as @xmath242 the impact parameter that corresponds to an energy enhancement equal to the internal gravitational energy of the system , i.e. @xmath243 , it is possible to determine the duration of the encounter , @xmath244 , that is the typical time - scale which discriminates between the two regimes : hence a catastrophic collision occurs if the duration of the encounter is short compared to the crossing time of the cluster , @xmath245 ; on the other hand , slower encounter leads to the diffusive regime .",
    "therefore , in the case of the catastrophic regime ( @xmath246 ) , the tipical disruption time is given by : @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the perturber density , and @xmath249 a constant . in the diffusive regime @xmath250 , instead , it is possible to show that the disruption time is given by : @xmath251 where @xmath252 is defined as : @xmath253 where @xmath254 and @xmath255 is defined above , and should be computed numerically .",
    "tidal effects are accounted for in our calculations in the above framework , so to investigate their role on the expected value of the nsc mass . in figure",
    "[ times ] we compare the dynamical friction time , @xmath256 , evaluated using equation [ tdf ] , the dissolution time , @xmath257 , given in equation [ tdis ] , and the tidal disruption time in the catastrophic regime @xmath258 for three values of the galaxy mass ( @xmath259m@xmath1 ) as a function of the distance , @xmath22 , from the centre of the host galaxy . on the other hand , the disruption time in the diffusive regime , @xmath260 ,",

    "however , the action of the tidal disruption mechanism does not change dramatically the final mass of the nsc ; in fact , the decrease in mass of the final nuclear cluster is reduced of only the @xmath270 respect to the case when the tidal action of the galaxy on the clusters is not considered .",
    "hence , the effect of tidal processes in such models is not too important in the determination of the final nsc masses . on the other hand , since in the rho model",
    "the minimum distance from the galaxy centre allowed for gc formation is given by the constraint that the gcs mass profile follows a dehnen profile , it could exceed @xmath271pc .",
    "this implies that many clusters lie in the region in which the tidal effects dominate , affecting strongly the final mass of the nsc .",
    "in this case , as we can see in figure [ rhon ] , the number of decayed clusters in very massive galaxies drops to zero avoiding the formation of nscs .    , but for the rho model .",
    "in this case , the number of decayed clusters for massive galaxies drops to 0 and there is no nsc formation.,width=321 ]          the difference between the rho model and the others , where the gcs positions are sampled randomly , puts in evidence two interesting things : the mass distibution of the clusters is not very important in deriving the nsc mass , but instead , what care is how clusters are distributed within the galaxy .",
    "this because at intermediate radial scales the disruption time is smaller than the decay time , while it is longer in the central region .",
    "hence , a concentrated spatial distribution allows the formation of the nsc because clusters in the innermost region of the galaxy decay rapidly .    in figure [ rhotid ]",
    "we report the values of nsc masses with respect to host masses for all the models considered taking into account the tidal disruption process .",
    "it is seen that in the case of the rho model the tidal interaction ( tidal heating ) inibhits the nsc formation for galaxies masses above @xmath272m@xmath1 , putting in evidence how important the spatial distribution of the clusters is .",
    "it is interesting noting that in this case , the scaling relations found are again in good agreement with the observations , if we restrict the comparison to the actually observed range of masses ( @xmath273m@xmath1 ) .",
    "moreover , it is relevant noting that the flattening observed in figure [ rhotid ] for the rho model has an observative `` counterpart '' : in fact it seems that galaxies more massive than @xmath108m@xmath1 do not host nscs .",
    "our results suggest that in heavy galaxies , in which tidal processes act against the dynamical friction , should form a nsc lighter than expected .",
    "as example , extrapolating from observation the mass of a nsc in a galaxy of @xmath127m@xmath1 , we should expect a nsc with @xmath274m@xmath1 ; however , the range of galaxy masses in which nscs are observed is dominated mainly by dynamical friction process .",
    "considering instead that in more massive galaxies disrupting processes dominate , it is possible to have nscs in galaxies heavier than @xmath108m@xmath1 with masses few times @xmath275m@xmath1 . in this picture , nscs may form in heavy ( but not _ too _ heavy ) galaxies , but are too small to emerge from the galactic background . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will investigate such matter in a more complete way .",
    "we found that the dry - merger scenario predicts masses for nscs and scaling laws between them and their host galaxies in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "the summary of our work is :    1 .",
    "an analytical treatment to estimate the formation and growth of nscs masses has been developed ; 2 .",
    "reliable galaxy models have been provided , as it has been shown comparing theoretical and observational global properties ; 3 .   assuming for the gc system in a galaxy a power - law mass function and a uniform spatial distribution , the analytical predictions fit very well observations ( sect .",
    "[ res ] ) ; 4 .",
    "the consequences of different initial mass distributions of the set of gcs in the host galaxies on the nsc final mass have been investigated from a statistical point of view , by sampling , for each galaxy , its gcs and considering how many clusters were able to sink to the galactic centre within a hubble time ; 5 .   by means of the statistical approach , we obtained some useful parameters , such as the gc mean mass and the number of survived clusters , which result in good agreement with observations ( sect.[stat ] and [ statmod ] ) ; 6 .",
    "scaling laws which connect the nsc parameters with total mass , velocity dispersion and bulge mass of the host have been deduced ; the agreement found between all the models considered and observations indicates that the gc mass distribution does not play a crucial role in determining the final nsc mass ( sect .",
    "[ laws ] ) ; 7 .",
    "the role of tidal disruption mechanism has been investigated under different assumptions for the spatial and mass distributions of gcs in their host galaxies : in rnd , pls and gss models the tidal heating causes a decrease of predicted nsc masses from few percent in small galaxies ( down to @xmath10m@xmath1 ) to @xmath270 in heavier galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", tidal disruption strongly affects nsc formation in the rho model , where the predicted nsc masses are almost constant in the range @xmath276m@xmath1 .",
    "an important result is that the best comparison for the nsc mass versus galactic host mass correlation is obtained when gcs have an initial spatial distribution equal to that of the galaxy , assumed to be in the dehnen s form .",
    "this because the relation shows the same flattening at high galactic masses than observed , while in the case of a different initial density profile for gcs , the @xmath277 relation keeps raising at high masses ( sect . [ tid ] ) ; 8 .   finally , our results suggest that in galaxies with masses above few times @xmath108m@xmath1 , hosting central black holes more massive than @xmath11 m@xmath1 , tidal processes dominate over dynamical friction , leading to nscs too `` small '' to emerge from the galactic background and be detected .",
    "this agrees with both ancient , general , results by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and the more specific recent results by @xcite .",
    "the overall conclusion is that the migratory - merger model for the formation of dense stellar agglomerates in galactic centers seems to be valid for a large range of types and masses of galaxies giving scaling relations in good agreement with observations and providing a possible explanation for the lack of nscs in bright galaxies .",
    "an important topic which remains to be investigated thoroughly is what fraction of young to old stars actually reside in nsc , thing which can constitute an important test for the nsc formation models .",
