    "until 2000 , little attention had been paid to the phenomenon of negative refraction . since 2000",
    ", there has been an explosion of interest in negative refraction pendry04,sar , following experimental reports of a metamaterial which supports negative refraction in the microwave regime ss .",
    "naturally  occurring uniaxial crystals have been extensively studied ever since the earliest days of the optical sciences . however , the electromagnetic properties of uniaxial mediums have recently been revisited by theoreticians in consideration of the prospects for npv propagation in such mediums kark , liu , yonghua , perez . a closely related issue concerns uniaxial dielectric  magnetic mediums with indefinite constitutive dyadics mith03,smith04 .    the defining characteristic of a uniaxial dielectric medium is a distinguished axis of symmetry , known as the optic axis .",
    "mathematically , the permittivity dyadic of a uniaxial dielectric medium may be expressed as @xmath0 where a coordinate system has been selected in which the direction of the optic axis coincides with the direction of the unit vector @xmath1 lying along the @xmath2 axis , and @xmath3 denotes the 3@xmath43 identity dyadic .",

    "consequently , the time  averaged poynting vector reduces to @xmath30 since @xmath31 we say that ordinary plane waves have positive phase velocity ( ppv ) for all directions of propagation .",

    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath79 are plotted against @xmath80 .",
    "the elliptical nonevanescent nature of the dispersion relation is clear for @xmath81 , while the hyperbolic evanescent nature is apparent for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the elliptical / hyperbolic geometric interpretation breaks down when dissipative mediums are considered",
    ". however , the corresponding dispersion relations are geometrically reminiscent of their nondissipative counterparts .",
    "this can be observed in figure  2 in which the graphs corresponding to figure  1 are displayed for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "second , we turn to the case @xmath7 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath79 are graphed against @xmath80 in figure  3 .",
    "the graphs mirror those of figure  1 but with nonevanescent and evanscent aspects interchanged ; i.e. , we observe hyperbolic nonevanescent characteristics for @xmath88 and @xmath83 , and elliptical evanescent characteristics for @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding graphs for @xmath89 and @xmath90 are presented in figure  4 .",
    "notice that the shapes of the graphs in figures  4 and 2 are similar but not identical .",
    "although uniaxial dielectric mediums with @xmath7 do not occur in nature ( to the best of the authors knowledge ) , they can be conceptualized as metamaterials by means of homogenization .",
    "for example , let us consider the homogenization of a composite comprising two component materials phases , labelled as @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "both component material phases are taken to be isotropic dielectric mediums : @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote the permittivity scalars of phases @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively . the component material phases are envisioned as random distributions of identically  oriented , spheroidal particles .",
    "the spheroidal shape    which is taken to be the same for all spheroids in component material phase @xmath91 and @xmath92    is parameterized via the shape dyadic @xmath95 .",
    "that is , we take the spheroid s principal axis to lie along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the spheroid s surface is prescribed by the vector @xmath96 with @xmath97 being the radial unit vector specified by the spherical polar coordinates @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the linear dimensions of the spheroid , as determined by the parameter @xmath100 , are assumed to be small relative to the electromagnetic wavelength(s ) .",

    "the polarizability dyadics in are defined as @xmath105 wherein the depolarization dyadic is given by the surface integral @xmath106 closed  form expressions for the depolarization dyadic for uniaxial mediums are available in terms of hyperbolic functions michel97 . however , we note that these exact results are not valid for nondissipative mediums with @xmath7 , and numerical evaluation of @xmath107 has to be resorted to .",
    "the jacobi iteration scheme @xmath108 where the operator @xmath109 is defined via @xmath110 may be employed to solve for @xmath111 .",
    "suitable initial values for the iterative scheme are provided by @xmath112 for further details on the bruggeman homogenization formalism the reader is referred to ml00,m03 and to references therein .",
    "let us consider the homogenization scenario wherein material component phase @xmath91 is taken to be iron at 670 nm free  space wavelength .",
    "correspondingly , we take @xmath113 . the material component phase @xmath92 is assumed to be free space ; i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "the shape of the component spheroids is specified by @xmath115 .",
