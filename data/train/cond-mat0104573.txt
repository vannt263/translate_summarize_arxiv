    "whereas the field - theoretic understanding of the universal critical properties of the superfluid phase transition has become quite satisfactory @xcite , the renormalization group ( rg ) have so far not been completely successful for the superconducting phase transition . the standard field theory investigated in this context is the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model , initially in @xmath13 dimensions by halperin , lubensky , and ma ( hlm)@xcite , who generalized a calculation of coleman and weinberg @xcite in four dimensions , and found no infrared stable fixed point at the one - loop level .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) flow was shown to run off to infinity in the @xmath14-plane if @xmath15 , with @xmath1 being the number of complex components of the scalar order parameter field . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the dimensionless versions of the quartic self - coupling @xmath18 of the order parameter and the square charge @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "hlm interpreted this result as indicating that the phase transition in a superconductor - which corresponds to a order parameter with @xmath0 - is of first - order .",
    "they supported this scenario by a mean - field estimate of the effective potential obtained by integrating out the vector potential , which led to a term @xcite @xmath20 , which leads to first - order phase transition .",
    "this was in contrast to monte carlo simulations of lattice superconductors in 1981 by dasgupta and halperin @xcite where a clear second - order phase transition was found .",
    "it also contradicted work by lawrie and athorne @xcite who performed a rg study in a non - linear realization of the gl model and found no indication of a first - order phase transition .",
    "moreover , the first - order scenario was also contradicted by experiments on the smectic - a to nematic phase transition in liquid crystals @xcite which according to de gennes @xcite can also be described by a gl model .    for small @xmath19 or large ginzburg parameter @xmath21 , the gl - model lies in the deep type ii regime where it goes over into a pure complex @xmath22-model which describes the superfluid phase transition , which is the best - understood second - order transition experimentally and theoretically .",
    "we may therefore expect a large-@xmath21 portion of the type ii regime to undergo a second - order transition .",
    "indeed , the monte carlo simulations of ref . and the non - linear realization of ref . were both in this regime",
    ".    the arguments leading to a first - order transition could therefore at best be reliable in the large-@xmath19 regime where the superconductor is of type i and the ginzburg parameter @xmath21 is small . only in this regime",
    "can the @xmath23-expansion be trusted and the important problem arose how to find a theory explaining both type i and type ii regimes .    one solution to this problem was proposed in 1982 by one of us@xcite by deriving a disorder field theory dual to the original gl model .",
    "the rg analysis of the disorder field theory shows very clearly that a charged fixed point exist in the original gl model @xcite .",
    "the disorder field theory exhibited a first- and a second - order regime with a tricritical point at@xcite @xmath24\\equiv 0.79/ \\sqrt{2 }    $ ] , a result confirmed only recently with excellent agreement by elaborate monte carlo simulations @xcite which gave @xmath25 . since the disorder theory is in pure @xmath26 universality class , the critical exponent @xmath27 of the disorder field in the second - order regime has the @xmath28-value @xmath29 @xcite , a result confirmed by monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the rg situation of the original gl model , however , remained completely unclear .",
    "no fixed point at @xmath0 appeared in an extension to two - loops by tessmann @xcite , a result confirmed later by kolnberger and folk using a more thorough analysis @xcite .",
    "folk and holovatch @xcite managed to find a charged fixed point only by setting up a suitable pad - borel resummation of the @xmath23-expansion .",
    "a three - loop calculation using the @xmath23-expansion is presently under progress . as a first step ,",
    "the ground state energy of the gl model was computed recently up to three - loop by kastening , kleinert , and van den bossche @xcite .",
    "another method that leads to a charged fixed point at @xmath0 was used by bergerhof _",
    "their method is based in the so called _ exact renormalization group _ @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "exact renormalization group equations are solved approximately using a truncated form for a scale - dependent effective action .",
    "the problem with this type of approach is that it seems to be uncontrolled , that is , there is no obvious expansion parameter . but",
    "this seems to be a common feature of most fixed dimension approaches .",
    "however , as we shall see later on in this paper , fixed dimension approaches are the best candidates to solve this old problem .    at fixed dimension @xmath2 there is the approach by herbut and tesanovic@xcite who performed a perturbative calculation directly at the critical point . these authors obtained a charged fixed point at one loop and @xmath0 by using two different momentum scales and different renormalization points for the two dimensionless couplings , @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "this introduces a new parameter @xmath32 .",
    "they find charged fixed points if @xmath33 .",
    "their approach has the problem that the parameter @xmath34 must be fixed from the outside .",
    "they do this by demanding that the value of the ratio @xmath35 matches at the tricritical point with kleinert s value@xcite @xmath36 , and found a critical exponent @xmath37 .",
    "the authors used also an older monte carlo estimate@xcite @xmath38 to fix @xmath34 which led to a @xmath39 closer to the the @xmath28 value . in the light of the recent simulation work @xcite obtaining the value @xmath40",
    ", the result @xmath38 becomes obsolete .",
    "there are two important universal observations made in ref . :",
    "first , if a charged fixed point exists , then the anomalous dimension of the vector potential is _ exactly _ given by @xmath41 for @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "second , this anomalous dimension implies the existence of @xcite a _ dimension - independent _ scaling relation @xmath43 between the magnetic penetration depth @xmath44 and the coherence length @xmath6 .",
    "subsequently , the ac conductivity @xmath45 was shown@xcite to have the scaling behavior @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the dynamic exponent .",
    "these results are in contrast to the _ dimension - dependent _ scaling relations @xmath48 and @xmath49 derived by d.s .",
    "et al._@xcite by _ neglecting _ thermal fluctuations of the magnetic field , leading to @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in ref .",
    "the two renormalization scales @xmath51 and @xmath52 play a decisive role for the emergence of the charged fixed point .",
    "however , since the correlation functions were calculated _ at _ the critical point , there was no direct relation between @xmath51 and @xmath52 and the two physical length scales of the gl model .",
    "one of this lengths , the penetration depth , is observable only in the _ ordered _ , since the vector potential becomes massive only below @xmath3 through the anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "it is therefore desirable to study the rg flow in such a way that @xmath3 is approached from below , and this is what we shall do in this paper by employing a semi - perturbative approach .",
    "since below @xmath3 the vector potential is a massive field , it provides us with the second physical mass scale of the system , and thus with the ginzburg parameter @xmath21 on which the rg functions depend explicitly .",
    "we shall exhibit a charged fixed point for @xmath0 and @xmath7 , that is , inside the type ii regime . in our analysis , @xmath8 appears as a natural expansion parameter when @xmath3 is approached from below .",
    "this is related to the existence of a singular behavior at @xmath53 .",
    "this singular behavior is already apparent in the mean field solution in a uniform external magnetic field by abrikosov @xcite .",
    "for example , the magnetization diverges at @xmath53 . to our knowledge , in the rg context",
    "this singular behavior in @xmath4 has never been explored before .",
    "we shall show that the existence of the charged fixed point is related to a singular behavior at @xmath53 occuring in the vector potential correlation function .",
    "this singularity has the physical meaning that it represents the point of separation between type i and type ii superconductivity . as discussed in ref . , the value of @xmath4 separating these two regimes should coincide with @xmath54 , being therefore lower than @xmath55 .",
    "the approximation we consider here is not able to correct upon the value @xmath53 , but higher order corrections will do .",
    "at this point it is worth to explain what we mean by higher order .",
    "our method is semi - perturbative . by this",
    "we mean that we start by assuming that a perturbative expansion in @xmath17 and @xmath16 is possible . however , we parametrize our theory by @xmath17 and @xmath4 such that all rg functions depend on these parameters .",
    "this is possible because @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the higgs mass and @xmath58 is the vector potential mass .",
    "we use @xmath59 as the running scale for the rg .",
    "thus , @xmath4 arises in the rg functions from two different sources : the coupling @xmath16 , which is rewritten as @xmath60 , and the loop integrals , from where the masses are combined in such a way as to produce functions of @xmath4 .",
    "the rg functions obtained in this way are polynomials in @xmath17 with coefficients depending on @xmath4 .",
    "thus , it is not really a standard perturbative series . this procedure will be explained in sections iii and iv .",
    "the key point is that for @xmath4 sufficiently close to @xmath53 from above , @xmath17 is small enough such that a charged fixed point can be obtained at @xmath0 .",
    "an interesting point revealed by our analysis is the role of @xmath4 in controlling the appearance of momentum space instabilities in the correlation functions . for @xmath7 , the two - point bare correlation function",
    "is maximized for a nonzero wave vector , similar to the roton peak in the correlation function of superfluid helium .",
    "this behavior seems to be the origin of the negative sign of the @xmath12-exponent and implies a critical behavior@xcite known from the theory of lifshitz points .",
    "in contrast to scalar models of lifshitz point , where the momentum space instability is already present at the tree level , the instability in the gl model is induced by magnetic fluctuations .",
    "interestingly , such fluctuation - induced lifshitz points also occur in the non - commutative @xmath61-theory , which also possesses a negative @xmath12 exponent@xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii we discuss the advantages of a rg approach to the gl model in @xmath2 dimensions in the disordered phase over the usual @xmath62-dimensional calculations .",
    "this approach is a generalization to the gl model of parisi s three - dimensional rg technique @xcite . in particular , we show that this approach , being sensitive to the infrared divergences of the vector potential , yields at the one - loop order a more reliable result than the one - loop @xmath23-expansion . in sections iii we renormalize the ordered phase followed by a detailed renormalization group analysis in section iv which culminates in the desired infrared - stable fixed point which could not be found in @xmath62 dimensions .",
    "some useful integrals used in the paper compiled in the appendix .",
    "the bare gl hamiltonian considered in this paper is given by    @xmath63    where    @xmath64    fixes the gauge .",
    "it will be convenient to express the complex fields in terms of real fields as @xmath65 the propagators are given in momentum space by @xmath66    @xmath67.\\ ] ]    since the free vector field is massless , perturbative calculation run into infrared problems .",
    "for instance , the feynman graph in fig . 1 contributing to the four - point function is infrared divergent at zero external momenta for any dimension @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , the loop integral in this graph is proportional to @xmath69 , so that the feynman integral yields in dimensional regularization @xcite a pole term @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "however , this pole reflects an _ ultraviolet _ divergence for @xmath72 , not an _ infrared _ divergence , which is physical source of critical properties .",
    "recall that the reason why ultraviolet divergences give nevertheless information on the infrared behavior is that a @xmath70 pole in @xmath73 is equivalent to a logarithmic divergence of the form @xmath74 at @xmath72 , where @xmath75 is the ultraviolet cutoff , and the ultraviolet limit @xmath76 at fixed @xmath77 is equivalent to taking the infrared limit @xmath78 at fixed @xmath75 .",
    "alternatively , we can choose @xmath79 as a scale parameter of the problem , confining the analysis to @xmath80 to avoid the logarithmic divergence at @xmath72 .",
    "this procedure is applicable in a rg analysis _ at _ the critical point performed by herbut and tesanovic@xcite .",
    "however , as we have discussed in the introduction , this procedure needs a second scale parameter @xmath52 which has to be determined from the outside .",
    "another way of regulating the infrared divergences of the gl model is to introduce a proca term in the hamiltonian , @xmath81 , which explicitly breaks gauge invariance .",
    "then we may perform the calculations of correlation functions using the infrared - finite propagator @xmath82,\\ ] ] and taking @xmath83 at the end .",
    "however , if dimensional regularization is used to evaluate the massive feynman integrals , final results are the same as in the dimensional regularization of the massless case , since the @xmath84 pole is the same for all @xmath85 : @xmath86 thus , the @xmath87-functions obtained with this procedure will have the same @xmath23-expansion as in the original work@xcite , where a charged fixed point exists only for a number of @xmath88 field components @xmath89 .",
    "a completely different result is obtained if we study the system directly in three dimensions .",
    "we specify the renormalization constants by rewriting the hamiltonian ( [ gl ] ) in terms of renormalized quantities as @xmath90 where the renormalized fields are defined by @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we shall work in the landau gauge where @xmath93 in @xmath94 .",
    "the term @xmath95 does not need a renormalization as a consequence of the ward identity @xcite which implies that @xmath96 .",
    "the renormalization constants @xmath97 , and @xmath98 and the renormalized proca mass @xmath99 are fixed using the normalization conditions for the one - particle irreducible renormalized @xmath100-point functions@xcite ( no sum over repeated @xmath101 indices ) : @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106    it is straightforward to calculate the following results at the one - loop level : @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 we define a dimensionless renormalized square charge by @xmath110 . using @xmath96",
    "we find the one - loop equation @xmath111 the @xmath87-functions are defined in general by the logarithmic derivatives @xmath112",
    "@xmath113    the derivatives with respect to @xmath59 have to be performed at fixed bare couplings . at this point",
    "we make a crucial observation . in the derivatives , we reexpress the bare couplings in terms of the renormalization @xmath17 and @xmath16 , while discarding terms beyond one - loop . however , the term proportional to @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) contains only a single power of @xmath59 in the denominator . _",
    "therefore this term will contribute only to the term @xmath115 in @xmath116 and no term proportional to @xmath117 will be present_. the result is @xmath118 -\\frac{4}{3\\pi}\\frac{e_0 ^ 2 u_0}{(m+m)^2}+\\frac{5u_0 ^ 2}{8\\pi m^2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & -g-\\frac{4}{3\\pi}\\frac{e_0 ^ 2 u_0}{(m+m)^2}+\\frac{5u_0 ^ 2}{8\\pi m^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the derivatives of @xmath99 with respect to @xmath59 do not contribute since they are of higher than one - loop order .",
    "taking the physically relevant limit @xmath119 , we obtain @xmath120 where in the second line we have replaced @xmath121 and @xmath122 , the error committed with this substitution is beyond the one - loop order under consideration .",
    "it is this result where the three - dimensional calculation in this paper differs essentially from the dimensionally regularized one in @xmath73 dimensions in which the @xmath123-function @xmath124 contains additional @xmath117 term .",
    "precisely this term is the culprit for the nonexistence of a charged fixed point in hlm .",
    "the second @xmath87-function is @xmath125 from eqs .",
    "( [ betag ] ) and ( [ betaf ] ) we obtain the infrared stable fixed point @xmath126 and @xmath127 .    at this point we may think that the problem is solved , and that the absence of a charged fixed point was merely an artifact of the @xmath23-expansion .",
    "unfortunately this is not true since at the fixed point , _ the critical exponents have completely unphysical values_. for example , the critical exponent @xmath12 , which is defined by the fixed point value of the rg function @xmath128 has the value @xmath129 , which is unphysical since it does not respect the bound @xmath130 .",
    "the reason for this is that the fixed - point value @xmath131 is quite large , and this leads to the unphysical value of @xmath132 .",
    "does this mean that the present approach must be discarded as well ?",
    "not completely .",
    "we are still much better off than hlm .",
    "as mentioned before , they judged how far their result was from nature , by changing the number of complex fields from 1 to @xmath1 with an o(@xmath133 ) symmetry among the real components .",
    "this served to suppress the @xmath117 term , since the graph of fig .",
    "1 is of order@xcite @xmath134 .",
    "our calculation has the advantage that the @xmath117 term is absent for any @xmath133 .",
    "suppose we go through our analysis for @xmath135 .",
    "then we find @xmath136 @xmath137 the critical exponent has now the value @xmath138 , which is physically meaningful provided @xmath139 .",
    "thus our three - dimensional approach yields a critical @xmath133 value @xmath140 , where the result becomes physical .",
    "this lies much lower than the critical hlm one - loop value @xcite @xmath141 .",
    "if our one - loop value @xmath140 is lowered by the two - loop corrections , there is a good chance of getting a physical exponent @xmath142 for a single complex order field @xmath143 .",
    "such a calculation remains to be done .",
    "further insight can be obtained by calculating the critical exponent @xmath27 .",
    "this is given by    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is the fixed point value of the rg function    @xmath146    at one - loop order it is given by    @xmath147    thus ,    @xmath148    positive values of @xmath27 are obtained for @xmath149 . however , for any finite value of @xmath133 we have @xmath150 . when @xmath151 we have @xmath152 .    as a last remark in this section ,",
    "let us comment about the absence of a tricritical fixed point in our one - loop calculation .",
    "the tricritical fixed point is absent because there is no @xmath117 in the @xmath87-functions ( [ betag ] ) and ( [ betagn ] ) . with this respect ,",
    "our approach gives a result similar to the @xmath153 expansion at @xmath154 , where there is only a second - order fixed point and no tricritical fixed point .",
    "it is evident , however , that a tricritical fixed point will be generated at two - loops , but in this case resummation is necessary . the same result is to be expected in the @xmath153 expansion at @xmath155 .",
    "we have seen in the preceding section that in three dimensions the situation improves by using a massive vector field to avoid infrared divergences in the feynman integrals . above @xmath3 , this mass",
    "is set equal to zero at the end . in the ordered phase ,",
    "such a mass is automatically present as a consequence of the meissner effect .",
    "in fact , there are no massless modes at all in the ordered phase , the goldstone boson supplying the longitudinal component to the massive vector field .",
    "the simplest way of representing this effect is in the unitary gauge . at the mean - field level , this amounts to the field parametrizations ( dropping the subscripts 0 indicating bare quantities for simplicity ) @xmath156 @xmath157 the above parametrization allows for a nonzero expectation value of the order field , that is , by setting @xmath158 . at the tree level",
    "this happens for @xmath159 . to avoid proliferating minus signs",
    ", it will be more convenient in this section to replace the term @xmath160 in the hamiltonian by @xmath161 , such that a nonzero expectation value of the order field exists for @xmath162 . in the coulomb gauge",
    "@xmath163 the partition function is calculated from the following functional integral @xmath164 the last factor in the measure being the faddeev - popov determinant .",
    "this is a convenient formulation of the field system since by performing the change of variables ( [ @rho ] ) and ( [ gtransf ] ) the functional integral can immediately be simplified by integrating out the angular field @xmath165 .",
    "its value is fixed by the delta function enforcing the coulomb gauge .",
    "the result of this integral precisely cancel the faddeev - popov determinant .    in terms of the fields ( [ @rho ] ) ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath166 where @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 .",
    "in this well known tree level analysis the goldstone has disappeared and the vector potential has becomes massive .",
    "the free propagator of the vector field is given by @xmath170 which corresponds to take the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath171 .",
    "now , at large @xmath77 the above propagator behaves like a constant .",
    "thus , the free scaling dimension of @xmath172 does not have the typical canonical scaling dimension @xmath173 of a vector field , but @xmath174 .",
    "but then power counting tells us that the interaction @xmath175 is not renormalizable in @xmath2 .",
    "thus , in the unitary gauge , the absorption of the goldstone mode in the longitudinal part of the massive vector meson seems to destroy renormalizability .",
    "the only way to obtain a renormalizable theory out of the unitary gauge is by keeping the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath176 nonzero during the feynman integrals calculation and take the limit @xmath171 at the end @xcite . in order to implement such a program",
    ", we should not use the unitary gauge parametrization given by eqs .",
    "( [ @rho ] ) and ( [ gtransf ] ) .",
    "this means that the goldstone boson will still be present in the theory .",
    "the pole coming from the goldstone boson propagator will be , however , canceled from physical quantities .    beside the renormalizability problem ,",
    "there is another difficulty with the unitary gauge which is related to the vortex content of the theory .",
    "the point is that the covariant derivative term @xmath177 in the gl hamiltonian ( [ gl ] ) goes over , in the parametrizations ( [ @rho ] ) and ( [ gtransf ] ) , into @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the _ vortex gauge field _ , a vector field describing the vortices in the superfluid @xcite .",
    "this field arises from the fact that @xmath165 is not a single - valued field , but a a cyclic field with the property @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the winding number or vorticity . for this reason ,",
    "the gradient @xmath182 is not simply equal to @xmath183 , but must be supplemented by such a vortex gauge field yielding @xmath184 , and ensuring the periodicity under @xmath185 .",
    "the vector gauge field removes possible delta functions arising from the gradient of jumps by @xmath186 in the cyclic field which exist around a vortex line in the superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "in fact , these vortices are crucial for driving the phase transition and can therefore not be neglected .",
    "it is , however , difficult to treat the vortex gauge field by conventional perturbation theory using feynman diagrammatic techniques . if we want to take vortices into account in perturbation expansions we must therefore avoid multivalued fields .",
    "a field parametrization which avoids the problems of the unitary gauge and has more desirable properties with respect to power counting is @xmath187 here the bare hamiltonian becomes @xmath188 where @xmath189 denotes the free part of the hamiltonian :    @xmath190 + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\bar{m}_0 ^ 2 + 3m_0 ^ 2)\\sigma_0 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}(-\\bar{m}_0 ^ 2+m_0 ^ 2 )",

    "we have @xmath197 .",

    "we obtain the propagators :    @xmath199    @xmath200    @xmath201    now power counting gives the desired dimensions in the ultraviolet since the vector propagator behaves like @xmath202 for large @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , the vector field is massive and the graph of fig .",

    "these divergences are absorbed into the bare masses @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
