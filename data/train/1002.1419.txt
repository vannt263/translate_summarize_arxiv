    "finite material losses , i.e. @xmath151 give rise to another effect related to the discussion in section [ subsec : sub - wavelength wire ] . if we put an emitter too close to the wire surface , non - radiative losses become increasingly important . thus",

    "the idea behind the phase gate is that due to the subradiant effect we saw above , the interaction of a nearby emitter can change the excited state from decaying into non - decaying thereby allowing the first emitter to pick up a @xmath162 phase shift conditioned on the other other .",
    "specifically , consider the level scheme of the two - atom system shown in fig  [ fig : phase_gate_levels ] , where we use the symmetric - antisymmetric superposition for the transitions coupled to the wire . the external , classical fields with rabi frequencies @xmath158 and @xmath159 give rise to coupling strengths to the symmetric or antisymmetric states given by @xmath166 assume now that the distance between the atoms is such that the symmetric state @xmath143 is subradiant , whereas the antisymmetric state @xmath142 is superradiant @xmath167 and that @xmath168 corresponding to @xmath169 and @xmath170 . choosing the driving strengths",

    "however it is possible to compensate the fast oscillations by using effective two - photon raman transitions rather than single - photon ones @xcite .",
