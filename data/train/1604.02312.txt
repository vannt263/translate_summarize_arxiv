    "metamaterials are a class of material engineered to produce properties that do not occur naturally @xcite .",
    "their fundamental building blocks , usually called meta - molecules or meta - atoms , allow to mould the flow of light in an unprecedented way @xcite .",
    "the study of these individual building blocks is of prime importance since their shape and electromagnetic properties governs the effective behaviour of the metamaterial . in particular",
    ", it is of great interest to distinguish which effects arise from the meta - atoms themselves or from their arrangement ( periodic or random ) .",
    "in addition , there is an ever increasing demand for controlling optical fields at the nanoscale for applications ranging from medical diagnostics and sensing to optical devices and optoelectronic circuitry @xcite . in particular , resonant local field enhancement is of paramount importance in phenomena such as surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) @xcite , improved non linear effects @xcite , optical antennae and the control of the local density of states @xcite or spectral filtering @xcite .",
    "resonant phenomena are largely at the core of all those applications , calling for a systematic study of modal properties of complex nanostructures .",
    "+ recently , a substantial amount of work have been devoted to the study of resonant interaction of light with nanophotonic systems , with particular focus on the computation and analysis of their quasi - normal modes ( qnms @xcite ) , also known as leaky modes @xcite , resonant states @xcite , quasimodes @xcite or quasi - guided modes @xcite in the literature ) .",
    "these modes are an intrinsic properties of open resonators , and the associated eigenfrequencies are complex - valued ( even for lossless materials ) , the real part giving the resonance frequency and the imaginary part being related to the linewidth of the corresponding resonance . a method based on quasi - normal modes expansion has been developed to compute the electromagnetic response of open periodic and non - periodic systems to an arbitrary excitation , allowing a simple and intuitive description of their resonant features @xcite .",
    "a similar approach has been employed to define mode volumes and revisit the purcell factor in dispersive nanophotonic resonators @xcite , and to compute qnms of perturbed nanoparticles for sensing applications @xcite .",
    "another technique called the resonant state expansion ( rse @xcite ) consists in treating the system as a perturbation of a canonical problem which spectral elements are known in closed form .",
    "the idea is to compute these perturbed modes and to use them in the modal decomposition .",
    "however , those approaches are inherently _ perturbative _ and often rely on the fact that the considered perturbation must be much smaller or with low refractive index compared the unperturbed system .",
    "+ to study the interaction of electromagnetic systems , coupled mode theories ( cmt ) @xcite have been developed using various formulations and extensively applied in particular in the context of optical waveguides ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , it has been extended to leaky eigenmodes with application in free space resonant scattering @xcite , absorption in semiconductors @xcite and fano resonances in photonic crystal slabs @xcite . after expanding the modes of the two uncoupled structures onto the modes of isolated simpler systems ,",
    "one obtains a system of ordinary differential equations , either in time or space .",
    "however , the coupled modes equations are of a rather heuristic nature and rely upon a slowly varying approximation , thus limiting the domain of application of the method .",
    "more recently , hybridization models have been introduced in the context of plasmonics @xcite , providing a simple and intuitive picture ( an electromagnetic analogue of molecular orbital theory ) to describe the plasmon response of complex nanostructures of arbitrary shape as the interaction of plasmons of simpler sub - structures .",
    "however , the formalism is limited to the quasi - static approximation .",
    "+ the method we develop here is general and relies only on the assumption that the coupled eigenmodes can be expressed as a superposition of the modes of the two uncoupled systems , which can be computed by a suitable numerical method or analytically in some simple cases . it can be applied to arbitrary shaped open resonators with both non trivial ( possibly anisotropic ) permittivity and permeability .",
    "we stress here that it handles _ quasi - normal modes _ associated with complex eigenvalues .",
    "the imaginary part of the eigenfrequency giving the leakage rate of the mode is fully taken into account in our method .",
    "in contrast with the cmt where the coupled modes amplitudes are obtained through solving a system of ordinary differential equations , the proposed model reads a generalized eigenvalue problem for the complex coupling coefficients and eigenfrequencies .",
    "we illustrate the validity of the proposed model on a 2d problem of a high index dimmer of rectangular cross section rods for transverse electric ( te ) polarization .",
    "the agreement between the model and full - wave finite element simulations is excellent and the convergence is analysed as function of the number of basis modes used . using our model , we then study the coupling of the two nanorods lowest order modes for symmetric and asymmetric dimers by using the first two modes of the isolated resonator .",
    "this reduced order model depicts a simple hybridization picture , allowing a better understanding of the coupled modes in terms of their fundamental spectral building blocks .",

    "however , there is numerical evidence that qnms and radiation modes are _ both _ needed in modal expansion for computing accurately electromagnetic fields @xcite . from a physical point of view , our interpretation is that including modes from the continuous spectrum helps reconstructing the eigenfield _ outside _ of the resonator , describing more accurately its radiative nature and thus increasing the precision on the imaginary part of the eigenfrequency , which reflects the leakage rate of the mode . +       ( @xmath114 ) .",
