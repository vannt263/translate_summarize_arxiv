    "there has been increased interest in numerical approximation of random partial differential equations ( pdes ) in recent years , due to the need to model the uncertainties or noises that arise in industrial and engineering applications @xcite . to solve random boundary value problems numerically",
    ", the monte carlo method obtains a set of independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) solutions by sampling the pde coefficients , and calculates the mean of the solution via a statistical average over all the sampling in the probability space @xcite .",
    "the stochastic galerkin method , on the other hand , reduces the spde to a high dimensional deterministic equation by expanding the random coefficients in the equation using the karhunen - love or wiener chaos expansions @xcite . in general , these two methods become computationally expensive when a large number of degrees of freedom is involved in the spatial discretization , particularly for three dimensional boundary value problems .",
    "the monte carlo method requires solving the boundary value problem many times with different sampling coefficients , while the stochastic galerkin method usually leads to a high dimensional deterministic equation that may be too expensive to solve .",
    "recently , we have developed a new efficient multi - modes monte carlo method for modeling acoustic wave propagation in weakly random media @xcite . to solve the governing random helmholtz equation ,",
    "the solution is represented by a sum of mode functions , where each mode satisfies a helmholtz equation with deterministic coefficients and a random source .",
    "the expectation of each mode function is then computed using a monte carlo interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ( mcip - dg ) method .",
    "we take the advantage that the deterministic helmholtz operators for all the modes are identical , and employ an @xmath0 solver for obtaining the numerical solutions . since the discretized equations for all the modes have the same constant coefficient matrix , by using the @xmath0 decomposition matrices repeatedly , the solutions for all samplings of mode functions are obtained in an efficient way by performing simple forward and backward substitutions .",
    "this leads to a tremendous saving in the computational costs . indeed , as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is comparable to that of solving a few deterministic helmholtz problem using the @xmath0 direct solver .    in this paper , we extend the multi - modes monte carlo method for approximating the solution to the following random elliptic problem : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is a bounded lipschitz domain in @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are random fields with continuous and bounded covariance functions . let @xmath7 be a probability space with sample space @xmath8 , @xmath9algebra @xmath10 and probability measure @xmath11 .",
    "we consider the case when the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 in is a small random perturbation of some deterministic diffusion coefficient such that @xmath12 here @xmath13 , @xmath14 represents the magnitude of the random fluctuation , and @xmath15 is a random function satisfying @xmath16 for some positive constants @xmath17 .",
    "the readers are referred to section [ sec-2 ] for the definition of the function spaces @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the random diffusion coefficient can be interpreted as diffusion through a random perturbation of some deterministic background medium .",
    "it is required that @xmath5 is uniformly coercive .",
    "that is , there exists a positive constant @xmath20 such that @xmath21    the proposed numerical method is based on the following multi - modes expansion of the solution : @xmath22 it is shown in this paper that the expansion series converges to @xmath23 and each mode @xmath24 satisfies an elliptic equation with deterministic coefficients and a random source .",
    "we apply the monte carlo method for sampling over the probability space @xmath25 and use the finite element method for solving the boundary value problem for @xmath24 at each realization .",
    "an interesting and important fact of the mode expansion is that all @xmath24 share the same deterministic elliptic operator @xmath26 , hence the @xmath0 decomposition of the finite element stiff matrix can be used repeatedly . as such , solving for @xmath27 for each @xmath28 and at each realization",
    "@xmath29 only involve simple forward and backward substitutions with the @xmath30 and @xmath31 matrices , and the computational complexity for the whole algorithm can be significantly reduced .",
    "it should be pointed out that here the randomly perturbed diffusion coefficient @xmath5 appears in the leading term of the elliptic differential operator , while for the helmholtz equation considered in @xcite , the random coefficient only appears in the low order term .",
    "this results in essential differences in both computation and analysis when the multi - modes expansion idea is applied to these two problems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with introducing some space notations in section [ sec-2 ] and discuss the well - posedness of the problem - . in section [ sec-3 ] , we introduce the multi - modes expansion of the solution as a power series of @xmath14 , and derive the error estimation for its finite - modes approximation .",
    "the details of the multi - modes monte carlo method are given in section [ sec-4 ] , where the computational complexity of the algorithm and the error estimations for the numerical solution are also obtained .",
    "several numerical examples are provided in section [ sec-5 ] to demonstrate the efficiency of the method and to validate the theoretical results .",
    "we end the paper with a discussion on generalization of the proposed numerical method to more general random pdes in section [ sec-6 ] .",
    "standard space notations will be adopted in this paper @xcite .",
