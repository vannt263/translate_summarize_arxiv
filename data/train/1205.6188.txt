    "the decoherence produced by the interaction of a quantum system with its environment is ubiquitous in nature and plays an important role in current quantum theory in at least two ways .",
    "first , it is widely believed that decoherence helps understand how the classical physics of macroscopic objects emerges as an approximation to underlying quantum mechanical laws .",
    "second , decoherence is the great enemy of quantum computation , quantum cryptography , and other schemes seeking to utilize specifically quantum effects for particular processes . for both reasons it is important to study specific microscopic models from which one can hope to obtain general principles for decoherence .",
    "the present paper is the study of a simple two - level system which can be thought of as a crude microscopic model of chiral molecules or ammonia in which the lowest quantum energy levels correspond to the nearly degenerate eigenstates of a double - well potential , with decoherence occuring through collisions with particles in the environment .",
    "microscopic studies of decoherence are often framed in terms of a master equation for the density operator of the decohering system .",
    "such descriptions are perfectly valid , but because they represent the average of a large ensemble of nominally identical systems , each with a different specific time development , they provide less information and less physical insight than the actual history of a single system . for example , in the phenomenon of intermittent fluorescence a single ion in a trap shows intermittent light and dark periods when it does or does not scatter resonance radiation @xcite . this behavior is not directly reflected in the density operator , even though from the latter one can deduce parameters which govern the statistical behavior of the individual ion .",
    "another way to understand the limitations of the density operator description is to consider its classical analog for a brownian particle confined to a small but macroscopic volume of a fluid by rigid walls .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath8 of the particle position @xmath9 will eventually tend to a constant over the region accessible to the particle , whereas the particle itself will continue to exhibit a sort of random walk .",
    "more details of what is going on in this steady - state situation is provided by the joint probability distribution of the sequence of successive positions @xmath10 of the particle at a sequence of times @xmath11 , that is , its _",
    "history_. averaging over a large number of histories will yield @xmath8 , but in the process the information needed for a more detailed temporal description of the particle is lost . in the quantum case unravelings of the master equation",
    "provide a more detailed description of the microscopic time development , but these are often viewed as mathematical artifacts having no necessary connection with what is really going on in the quantum system .",
    "there are many possible unravelings ; which , if any are correct ? standing in the way of answering this question is the infamous _ measurement problem _ of quantum foundations : textbook quantum mechanics introduces probabilities by means of measurements , but can not say what it actually is that is being measured .    however , the _ consistent histories _ or _ decoherent histories_hereafter simply referred to as _ histories_formulation of quantum mechanics , has no measurement problem , and provides the tools needed to identify trajectories or sequences of events that actually correspond to physical processes . or , putting it another way",
    ", it allows one to identify certain classes of microscopic stochastic processes which can be consistently described in a fully quantum mechanical terms .",
    "the histories approach has previously been applied to quantum optical systems by brun @xcite , though we believe the material presented here is the first application to the case of tunneling molecules , including chiral molecules .",
    "early in the development of quantum mechanics the question arose as to why chiral molecules are observed in left- and right - handed versions even though the quantum ground state should be a symmetrical combination of the two forms .",
    "hund @xcite provided the first step in addressing this paradox when he pointed out that the two enantiomers correspond to the two wells of a symmetrical potential with two minima , and that the time required to tunnel from one well to another for a typical chiral molecule is extremely long .",
    "a second step was provided by simonius @xcite who observed that interaction with the environment of a suitable sort ( i.e. , decoherence , though when he wrote that term was not yet current ) can stabilize the chiral states for periods substantially longer than the tunneling time . at present",
    "it seems widely accepted that such decoherence is an important aspect of the stability of chiral molecules , though there have been dissenting voices , e.g. @xcite .    the time dependence of the two - state model introduced in sec",
    ".  [ sct2 ] , when analyzed in terms of consistent histories using the principles discussed in sec .",
    "[ sct3 ] , and applied to specific consistent families in sec .",
    "[ sct4 ] , yields some insight into this stability problem .",
    "in particular , we find that if the rate of decoherence due to collisions @xmath12 ( a parameter in our model ) is much larger than the tunneling rate @xmath13 in an isolated molecule , there is a consistent family in which the molecule spends a long but random period of time in each of the chiral states before flipping to the one of opposite chirality , in a two - state markov process .",
    "as @xmath12 decreases the flips become more rapid and the `` dressed '' quantum states between which the flips occur become less and less chiral , with this type of family finally disappearing at a phase transition @xmath14 . for @xmath15 there is a different consistent family with a rapid but continuous oscillation of the molecule back and forth between its chiral states , interrupted at random times by a change in phase .",
    "there are a variety of other consistent families , and these are discussed , along with their physical interpretation , in sec .",
    "most chiral molecules in most circumstances will be in the strong decoherence regime .",
    "we give some approximate numerical values in sec .",
    "[ sbct6.1 ] for d@xmath5s@xmath5 in a buffer gas of helium , as it has been the subject of some careful calculations in @xcite . on the other hand the ammonia molecule , which though not itself a chiral molecule can behave like one in certain rotational states , has an inversion ( tunneling ) transition with a frequency that goes to zero with increasing pressure .",
    "this is probably an example of , or at least very similar to , the @xmath14 phase transition , for reasons discussed in sec .",
    "[ sbct6.2 ] .    an intuitive way of characterizing the stochastic time development in the histories formalism is to quantify the information dynamics , e.g. , the loss over time of information about the system s initial state due to random hopping .",
    "such information loss is ultimately connected to decoherence @xcite , which can alternatively be viewed as flow of information about the system to the environment @xcite , and in sec .",
    "[ sct5 ] we illustrate the quantitative connection between these two views of decoherence for our model . in our model decoherence corresponds to a flow of chiral information  i.e . ,",
    "is the molecule left or right handed ? to the environment . in sec .",
    "[ sct5 ] we analyze this using quantitative measures defined in sec .",
    "[ sbct3.3 ] , and compare the flow of chiral information to the environment with the decrease of complementary types of information ( e.g. , parity information ) about the earlier state of the molecule that remain in the molecule itself at later times .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sct7 ] , which also indicates some ways in which the results reported here could be usefully extended .",
    "a few mathematical derivations and details are placed in appendices .",
    "we consider a quantum system , the molecule , with a double - well potential in which the two lowest energy eigenstates , @xmath16 ( even parity ) and @xmath17 ( odd parity ) , are sufficiently well separated in energy from all the higher levels that the latter can be ignored .",
    "the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the pauli operator @xmath20 , so the energy splitting between the levels is @xmath21 .",
    "the linear combinations @xmath22 represent the right- and left - handed chiral forms of the molecule , or in ammonia the nitrogen on one or the other side of the plane formed by the hydrogens . in real molecules",
    "there are , of course , additional degrees of freedom  rotations , vibrations , etc .",
    "we are assuming that for our purposes these can be ignored , i.e. , the hilbert space can be approximated as a tensor product of these other degrees of freedom with the two levels representing the tunneling , with negligible coupling between them . hence the isolated molecule can be thought of as oscillating or tunneling between the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states at an angular frequency @xmath13 . in the bloch sphere picture",
    "the kets @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to the points on the positive and negative @xmath25 axis , and the sphere rotates about the @xmath26 axis as time increases .",
    "next we assume the molecule collides randomly with other particles ( atoms or molecules ) , and the duration of each collision is short compared to the times we are interested in .",
    "successive collisions need not be independent of each other , but we assume that correlations die away rapidly after some _ correlation time",
    "_ @xmath27 , which could be shorter than the average time between collisions in a dilute gas , but might be significantly longer in a dense gas or liquid .",
    "we will consider properties of the molecule at a succession of times @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30  , where the @xmath31th time interval , @xmath32 is always greater than @xmath27 , and ideally should be significantly greater than @xmath27 .",
    "that is , we are using a description which is coarse - grained in time ; the importance of this will appear later . during the @xmath31th time interval",
    "there may be zero or one or more collisions of other particles with the molecule , and different collisions can have different effects .",
    "we shall assume that the probability distribution for these collisions in a particular interval , both for the times at which they occur and the effects which they have on the molecule , are _ statistically independent _ of what happens in other intervals .",
    "obviously this can not be exactly correct , but on physical grounds it seems reasonable provided @xmath33 is not too short , which is why we assume that it is larger than @xmath27 .",
    "in addition we assume , as is appropriate for a steady state situation , that this probability distribution depends only on the length @xmath33 of the interval , and not otherwise on @xmath34 .",
    "the next assumption is that at the beginning of a time interval of length @xmath35 the molecule and the environment can be adequately described , for the purposes of what happens next , as a tensor product of a molecule state and some density operator for the environment .",
    "the latter is the quantum analog of a probability distribution for incoming particles which might collide with the molecule during this time interval .",
    "this density operator can be `` purified '' by regarding it as arising from an entangled pure state between the environment and an auxiliary reference system , which we also take to be part of the environment .",
    "the overall time development of the molecule and the environment during the interval @xmath35 is then given by a unitary time development operator , corresponding to an appropriate hamiltonian , acting on the system and environment , resulting in an isometry mapping the hilbert space @xmath36 of the molecule onto @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the hilbert space of the environment .",
    "if one traces out the environment the result is a quantum operation or channel from @xmath36 to itself : the channel input is the molecule at the beginning of the time interval @xmath35 and its output is the molecule at the end of this interval .",
    "it is represented by a completely - positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) superoperator @xmath39 from the space @xmath40 of linear operators on @xmath36 to itself . tracing out the molecule instead of environment at the end of the time interval results in a corresponding cptp map @xmath41 from @xmath40 to @xmath42 , representing the _ complementary _ channel .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for further details on how the direct and complementary channel are related to the isometry .",
    "the assumption of statistical independence of successive time intervals , and that the environment is in a steady state , allows us to treat the interval from @xmath29 to @xmath30 in the same way as the interval from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "thus a succession of time intervals can be thought of , so far as the molecule is concerned , as a set of channels in series , with dynamics corresponding to an appropriate composition of the superoperators @xmath43 for the corresponding intervals .",
    "the use of a superoperator @xmath39 that depends only on the length @xmath35 of the time interval may give rise to the misleading impression that we are assuming exactly the same number and type of collisions for any interval of length @xmath35 .",
    "but this is not so . to understand why , consider a classical stochastic process for which the independence of successive time intervals justifies using a markov model , and for simplicity assume that all the time intervals are of equal length .",
    "let @xmath44 be a discrete index labeling molecule states at a single time , @xmath45 its value at the beginning of the @xmath31th time interval , and @xmath46 the markov matrix for a transition @xmath47 if precisely @xmath48 collisions occur in one time interval .",
    "the probability distribution for a collection of histories that all begin in the state @xmath49 conditioned on a specified set @xmath50 of numbers of collisions in the different intervals is @xmath51 on the other hand , if the sequence of collision numbers is _ not _ known , the probability _ not _ conditioned on this information is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the averaged markov matrix , @xmath54 and @xmath55 the probability of @xmath48 collisions during a single time interval . in the quantum case",
    "the single superoperator @xmath39 is the analog of an averaged markov matrix , and it will allow us to correctly compute the probability of a sequence of histories as long as we do not try and condition it on more detailed information about the initial state of the environment at the beginning of the time interval .      as noted above ,",
    "@xmath39 only makes physical sense for @xmath35 greater than some correlation time @xmath27 . keeping this in mind , it is nonetheless very convenient to think of the argument of @xmath39 as a continuous variable , which we shall hereafter denote by @xmath57 , thus @xmath58 .",
    "this superoperator can be written in various ways , e.g. , using kraus operators or as a matrix using some basis of the operator space of a qubit .",
    "a convenient basis is provided by the pauli operators : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , in terms of which we write @xmath63 using a matrix @xmath64 of real coefficients whose first row ( because @xmath56 is trace preserving ) is @xmath65 .",
    "the remaining rows constitute a collection of 12 ( real ) parameters which are only constrained by inequalities that ensure that @xmath56 is completely positive . applying @xmath58 to a density operator @xmath66 at @xmath67 , with the coefficients @xmath68 regarded as a column vector @xmath69 , results in a density operator @xmath70 at time @xmath57 , where @xmath71 .    rather than explore the entire parameter space ,",
    "we have assumed that @xmath64 has the particularly simple form @xmath72 where @xmath13 is the precession frequency for @xmath23 to @xmath24 and back again for the isolated molecule  the energy difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 is @xmath21and @xmath73 is the _ rate of decoherence_. justification based on scattering theory for this form of @xmath64 has been discussed in @xcite .    to see the motivation behind ,",
    "first consider the case of the isolated molecule with no decoherence , @xmath74 .",
    "then @xmath75 corresponds to precession about the @xmath26 axis in a bloch sphere picture .",
    "next , suppose that @xmath76 , so that only decoherence is present",
    ". then @xmath77 when @xmath78 is small , and @xmath79 with @xmath80 a second order correction .",
    "thus combines the competing effects of decoherence and the molecule s internal dynamics .",
    "the motivation behind is a simple physical picture in which if the environment is initially in the state @xmath81 its interaction with the molecule during a collision corresponds to the unitary transformation @xmath82 where the environment states @xmath81 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are orthonormal .",
    "the intuitive idea is that the distinction between @xmath24 and @xmath23 is carried off to the distinct environmental states @xmath83 and @xmath84 with an amplitude that increases with @xmath85 , a quantity lying between 0 and 1/2 which is a measure of the effectiveness of the decoherence .",
    "the decohering effect is unchanged if @xmath81 on the right side of is replaced with any other state @xmath86 as long as it is orthogonal to @xmath83 and @xmath84 , i.e. , if the alteration does not depend upon the difference between @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "one can represent the channel corresponding to by three kraus operators associated with @xmath81 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , but an equally good form uses just two kraus operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 corresponding to a `` bit flip '' channel in @xcite p.  376 .",
    "when @xmath89 there is no decoherence ( a perfect channel ) whereas for @xmath90 the collision `` collapses '' the molecule into either @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "if one sets @xmath91 the superoperator corresponding to the process is given by , and this makes sense for @xmath78 of the order of the time between collisions .",
    "however , as noted above in sec .",
    "[ sbct2.1 ] , the superoperator @xmath58 can appropriately represent a situation in which the number of collisions in the interval @xmath78 is a random quantity .",
    "the matrix @xmath92 and the density operator @xmath93 thought of as a column vector satisfy the simple linear differential equations : @xmath94 the second is equivalent to a master equation in lindblad form @xmath95/\\hbar + \\gamma ( x\\rho x-\\rho),\\ ] ] with @xmath96 as in .",
    "solutions to and can of course be expressed as linear combinations of exponentials of the form @xmath97 , where @xmath98 @xmath99 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath101 and @xmath102 occur in solutions of the form @xmath103 to the damped oscillator equation @xmath104 .",
    "thus for @xmath105 they are complex conjugates of each other lying on a circle of radius @xmath106 in the complex plane , corresponding to oscillatory solutions , while for @xmath107 both are real and negative , corresponding to damped motion without oscillation .",
    "critical damping @xmath108 corresponds to a phase transition in the sense of a changeover between two qualitatively different types of behavior .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath92 is given in appendix  [ apdxa ] .",
    "in the ( consistent or decoherent ) histories formalism a _ history _ is a sequence of quantum properties , identified by projectors onto appropriate subspaces of the quantum hilbert space , at a succession of times @xmath109 ; see ch .",
    "in the situation at hand we use a sample space of mutually exclusive histories formed by assuming that at time @xmath34 the properties of interest to us correspond to a collection @xmath110 of projectors which form a decomposition of the identity : @xmath111 here the subscript @xmath31 labels the time , while the superscript @xmath112 is not an exponent but instead a label to differentiate the projectors at this time .",

    ".    if all the projectors in the decomposition @xmath110 are rank 1 , which is to say they project onto pure states of the molecule , and the consistency conditions are satisfied , then the probabilities ( corresponding to the diagonal elements of the decoherence functional ) are those of a memoryless hopping process - a markov process . if the time steps @xmath145 are identical and the same decomposition is used at every time , this process is stationary ( homogeneous , i.e.  same markov matrix at each timestep ) , but in general it is nonstationary ( inhomogeneous ) .",

    "[ note that since @xmath56 is a ( completely ) positive superoperator , @xmath170 . ] in the case of qubits , the situation of primary interest for the present paper , one can show that consistent families of histories of the type must satisfy either the forward or the backward condition .",
    "we will want to discuss and quantify the information about the initial state of the molecule as time goes on .",
    "we can do this within the context of the histories formalism .",
    "alternatively , we can do this in the context of the quantum channel formalism , i.e. , quantifying the distinguishability of density operators at the output of a quantum channel , and as we will see there is some connection between the two approaches .",
    "let us first consider information from the histories perspective .",
    "suppose some consistent family of histories uses the projective decompositions @xmath171 at time @xmath29 and @xmath172 at time @xmath34 , with @xmath173 [ for simplicity here we replaced the indices @xmath174 and @xmath112 in and with @xmath44 and @xmath175 .",
    "as in @xcite , we will equate the notion of a projective decomposition , like @xmath176 , with a type of information about the system , in our case the molecule .",
    "a convenient measure of how much of the @xmath176 type of information about the molecule remains at time @xmath34 is the shannon mutual information @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the familiar shannon entropy .",
    "in particular if @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 are projective decompositions associated with a consistent family at three successive times , and if the probabilities correspond to a markov process , then ( see , e.g. , p.  510",
    "of @xcite ) @xmath182 can not be greater than @xmath183 : the information about the initial situation can only decrease with time . for simplicity , in what follows we will set @xmath184 for all @xmath44 , where @xmath185 is the number of projectors in the decomposition @xmath176 .",
    "then @xmath186 , and hence the information decays from its initial value of @xmath187 as time goes on .",
    "now , alternatively , consider the quantum channel perspective , where we will quantify how much of the @xmath176 type of information remains at time @xmath34 by measuring the _ distinguishability _ of the conditional density operators at the output of the relevant quantum channel .",
    "( this approach was taken in @xcite . ) to measure distinguishability of density operators , in particular if these density operators do not commute , we need a measure that is inherently quantum - mechanical , which is provided by the holevo function @xmath188 defined for an ensemble @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the probability assigned to the density operator @xmath191 , and @xmath192 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "applying this measure to the ensemble @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the quantum channel that governs the molecule s evolution from @xmath29 to @xmath34 , gives a quantitative measure of how much @xmath176 information remains at time @xmath34 , and we write this as @xmath195 where @xmath196 .",
    "equations   and give two alternative ways to measure the loss of information from the system over time . equation   has the advantage of a clear conceptual interpretation , whereas equation   has the advantage of being easy to compute since one does not need to go through the histories analysis to compute it .",
    "fortunately , there is a connection between these approaches .",
    "it turns out , see the argument in appendix  [ apdxc ] , that for a family satisfying the forward consistency condition @xmath197 a similar sort of connection holds for families satisfying the backward consistency condition ( but involving the adjoint channel @xmath198 ) , but for simplicity we will focus on families satisfying the forward condition to illustrate information flows in sect .  [ sct5 ] .",
    "one can also quantify information flow from the molecule to the environment with the quantum channel approach by using the complementary channel with superoperator @xmath199 , introduced in sec .",
    "[ sbct2.1 ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath199 is completely determined by @xmath56 up to an isometry on its output ( the environment ) , which does not affect distinguishability measures like @xmath200 .",
    "hence , the following information measure is well - defined : @xmath201 where @xmath196 .",
    "it quantifies the amount of the @xmath176 type of information about the molecule ( at time @xmath29 ) that is present in the environment at time @xmath34 . though one can not in general equate this @xmath202 with a shannon mutual information between the molecule and the environment , the former provides , as is well - known ( e.g. , p.  531 of @xcite ) , an upper bound on the latter .",
    "we note that there can be a tradeoff in sending information to the environment and preserving it in the molecule , which is most dramatic for complementary or _ mutually - unbiased _ bases @xmath176 and @xmath203 : @xmath204 this inequality is from corollary 6 of @xcite .",
    "our model has only two states , and therefore any ( nontrivial ) decomposition of the identity involves only projectors of rank 1 onto pure states .",
    "thus a consistent history family corresponds to a two - state markov process ( sometimes called a `` telegraph process '' ) ; in general this process is nonstationary :  the transition rates depend upon the time .",
    "while such a process can be discussed using discrete times separated by finite intervals , the results are simpler and the mathematical expressions more transparent if one adopts a continuous time approximation with differential equations in place of difference equations .",

    "which end of the diameter corresponds to these angles does not matter for the following discussion .",

    "the backwards consistency condition can be analyzed in a similar way , and leads to the differential equations @xmath218 governing the direction of the diameter , and to exactly the same expression for the transition rate . for a more detailed derivation of these formulas",
    "see appendix  [ apdxbb ] .      if the angles @xmath210 and @xmath211 which determine the diameter for the projectors forming a consistent family do not change with time the markov process is stationary or homogeneous , in the sense that the states and the transition probabilities do not change with time ; of course the actual state of the molecule is varying randomly as it hops back and forth between the two states .",
    "the simplest case is what we call the @xmath26 family , in which @xmath212 ( or @xmath219 ) , thus @xmath220 in or and @xmath221 is irrelevant .",
    "the two projectors @xmath222 and @xmath223 correspond , respectively to the even parity ( ground ) and odd parity ( excited ) states of the isolated molecule .",
    "thus we have a two - state stationary markov process in which the molecule spends a certain amount of time in the even parity state before flipping instantaneously ( in our continuous time approximation ) to the odd parity state where it remains for a random time interval before flipping back . the time @xmath224 between flips is a random variable with an exponential distribution @xmath225 , since setting @xmath212 in gives @xmath226 for the transition rate .",

    "there is no need to make any reference to measurements , though it is in principle possible ( i.e. , does not violate the laws of quantum mechanics ) to use a succession of suitably idealized measurements to determine which of these histories is actually realized . but because one is dealing with a system exhibiting `` quantum '' behavior , i.e. , in a regime in which a classical description is not adequate , it is important to keep in mind certain respects in which quantum descriptions differ from their classical counterparts .",
    "in particular , two consistent families of histories may be mutually incompatible with each other in such a way that they can not be combined into a single description that makes sense .",
    "a well - known example is a spin - half particle where incompatibility arises from the fact that the operators for angular momentum in different directions do not commute with each other , and hence have no common eigenvectors .",
    "it makes good ( quantum ) sense to say , for example , that @xmath253 ( in units of @xmath254 ) , or that @xmath255 , but there is no quantum property , no subspace in the hilbert space , that corresponds to @xmath253 _ and _ @xmath255 .",

    "consider the situation in which @xmath12 is much larger than @xmath13 , strong decoherence .",
    "there is a stationary family , sec .",
    "[ sbct4.2 ] , the `` chiral '' family , in which the molecule hops back and forth at a comparatively slow rate between the ( dressed ) left - handed and right - handed chiral states .",
    "( there are actually two of these dressed-@xmath25 families , but when decoherence is strong there is very little difference between them . )",
    "this is the family to use if one is interested in understanding why a specific chirality , the left or right - handed form of the molecule , can persist for a very long time in a situation of strong decoherence .",
    "it provides a description in terms of a stochastic two - state markov process in which the rate of hopping from left to right - handed or vice versa is a well - defined function , @xmath238 in , of the parameters that enter the model .",
    "( each hop is instantaneous on the time scale used for our description , in which intervals less than the correlation time @xmath27 do not enter ; see sec .  [ sct2 ] . ) as the rate of decoherence decreases , the hopping time becomes shorter and the amount of `` dressing '' required to produce a consistent family increases , which means that even though this family continues to provide a correct quantum description , it no longer corresponds to a simple physical picture of a definite left- or right - handed molecule when @xmath12 becomes comparable to @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to this chiral family there is a @xmath26 or `` parity '' family in which the molecule hops back and forth at random time intervals between parity eigenstates ( energy eigenstates of the isolated molecule ) , at a rate given by the decoherence rate @xmath12 , see .",
    "the parity family is incompatible with the chiral family discussed above , and they can not be combined .",
    "one should not try and imagine them as going on simultaneously ; to do so would be to make the same mistake as supposing that @xmath257 and @xmath256 for a spin - half particle can simultaneously possess values .",
    "on the other hand , just as it is possible to measure either @xmath257 or @xmath256 , but not both simultaneously , it is also possible in principle ( without violating the laws of quantum mechanics ) to determine by measurements the succession of events that occur in a parity family , or by a different set of measurements those occurring in a chiral family .",
    "thus a relatively rapid but random flipping back and forth between parity eigenstates is a valid physical picture of the succession of microscopic states of the molecule , one which can be used both when the decoherence is strong and when it is weak .",
    "there is in addition a third stationary family for @xmath249 , the dressed @xmath231 family , which has a relatively rapid hopping rate in the strong decoherence regime , and eventually merges with the chiral family as the decoherence rate decreases .",

    "@xmath258 , there are no truly stationary families , apart from the parity family discussed above .",

    "although the molecule is not chiral , when it is rotating about an axis passing through the nitrogen and the midpoint between the hydrogen atoms the symmetry operation of parity ( inversion ) moves the nitrogen to the other side of the plane , changing the sign of the electric dipole , while leaving the angular momentum unchanged .",

    "the first , exemplified by @xcite , and with similar ideas in @xcite among others , starts with the observation that since the ammonia molecule possesses a significant electric dipole moment when the nitrogen is on one side of the hydrogen plane there will be a strong dipole - dipole interaction between nearby molecules .",
    "it is then proposed that this produces a sort of mean - field effect in which the polarization of one molecule influences its neighbors in such a way that eventually as the pressure increases and the molecules come closer together , the double well potential for a single molecule is changed into one with a single minimum on one side of the hydrogen plane , resulting in molecules of pyramidal shape .",
    "an alternative approach found in @xcite focuses instead on the decohering effects of collisions between gas molecules .",
    "it is argued that these collisions in addition to broadening the lines can also lower the tunneling frequency as the pressure , and thus the collision rate , increases . from this perspective the electric dipole - dipole interaction , while significant in determining the collision cross section and the effects of collisions , is not the fundamental source of the line shift to lower frequencies .",
    "the latter ought still to be present if ammonia is a dilute component in a nonpolar buffer gas .",
    "of particular significance for this second point of view is the work of ben - reuven @xcite , who argued on theoretical grounds that when proper account is taken of the effects of collisions the line shape , absorption as a function of frequency , is not adequately represented by the van vleck and weisskopf formula @xcite used earlier in @xcite to analyze the experimental data .",
    "he proposed an alternative line shape function with three parameters , @xmath12 , @xmath323 and @xmath324 , proportional to the collision rate , and thus the pressure , to fit the experimental microwave absorption data for nh@xmath302 and ( with a different choice of parameters ) nd@xmath302 over a range of frequencies and pressures sufficient to include that at which the tunneling frequency goes to zero .",
    "it is noteworth that this fit was achieved for all pressures and frequencies using just these three parameters , whereas the earlier analysis of bleaney and loubser @xcite was carried out by adjusting two parameters separately for each pressure .",
    "the validity of ben - reuven s analysis is supported by the fact that more recent data on microwave absorption by ammonia in mixtures of hydrogen and helium ( of interest in studies of the atmospheres of jupiter and the other giant planets ) has been fitted using his line shape formula for the tunneling transition @xcite with , of course , different choices of parameters for the different species scattering from the ammonia molecule .",
    "since neither hydrogen nor helium has an electric dipole moment , this tends to support the idea that collisions , rather than dipole - dipole interactions as such , are what drive the transtion frequency to zero in pure ammonia gas as the pressure rises .",
    "the numbers given in @xcite would suggest a phase transition at about 20 atmospheres for ammonia in a buffer gas of hydrogen at room temperature . replacing nh@xmath302 with nd@xmath302",
    "should bring the transition pressure down by a factor of 15 , and replacing hydrogen with a gas of some other nonpolar molecule might be advantageous",
    ". thus a direct experimental test of whether dipole - dipole interactions are or are not essential for understanding the vanishing of the tunneling frequency seems feasible .",
    "our very simple decoherence model corresponds to setting @xmath325 and @xmath326 in ben - reuven s theory as it applies to a two - level system .",
    "in fact , he achieved a good fit to the experimental data with @xmath326 , but with @xmath12 larger than @xmath323 by a factor of around 1.3 , see p.  21 of @xcite . to have @xmath12 larger than @xmath323 in our model",

    "nonetheless , we think our considerations provide some insight into the sense in which the ammonia molecule can be said to be `` pyramidal '' in the gas at high pressure and lack this feature at low pressures .",

    "[ sbct4.5 ] , in which in quantum mechanical terms the molecule spends a time much longer than the tunneling time in a pyramidal shape ( or a `` dressed '' state close to it ) which is `` chiral '' in the sense that electric dipole moment has a definite orientation relative to the angular momentum , with occasional random hops between the two pyramidal possibilities . as the pressure decreases towards the transition pressure the pyramidal picture begins to break down : the hops become more frequent between dressed states , which are starting to lose their pyramidal character . at still lower pressures it is better to think of the molecule as continuously tunneling back and forth , rather than possessing a fixed pyramidal form , with a period that diverges as the pressure rises to its value at the transition",
    "we have shown how the decoherence of a two - state tunneling molecule , a chiral molecule or ammonia , in the presence of a buffer gas can be described in terms of a succession of quantum states of the molecule itself that form a consistent family of histories , on a sufficiently coarse time scale so that intervals are always longer than a correlation time .",
    "our model is described by just two parameters , a tunneling rate @xmath328 and a decoherence rate @xmath1 , and its essential properties depend upon the ratio @xmath242 .",
    "in addition we have studied the flow of information to the environment , along with its retention by the molecule itself , during the process of decoherence .",
    "we found a large variety of consistent families , some of which are stationary ( in the sense of markov processes ) and some of which are not . in the regime @xmath329 of strong decoherence",
    "there is a stationary family ( actually two closely related families ) in which the molecule spends a relatively long time in one of its chiral states before flipping to the other chirality , and eventually flipping back again , in a stationary markov ( `` telegraph '' ) process , with a transition rate which is approximately @xmath330 for @xmath331 , and hence quite slow compared to the tunneling rate @xmath13 .",
    "thus this `` chiral '' family explains the persistence of chirality for a long period of time when there is strong decoherence .",
    "however , as @xmath242 decreases , the transitions between chiral states become more frequent and the states themselves ( the `` dressed @xmath25 '' states of sec .",
    "[ sbct4.2 ] ) lose their chiral character , until finally this family disappears entirely at a phase transition @xmath332 .",
    "we have found two other stationary consistent families for @xmath333 .",
    "one of them is the `` parity '' family in which the molecule is at each of the times considered in one of the two states of definite parity ( the energy eigenstates of the isolated molecule ) , but with a transition rate of @xmath12 between them , thus a rapid flipping compared to transitions between chiral states when the decoherence is large .",
    "this family , present at all values of @xmath242 , is incompatible , in the quantum mechanical sense , with the chiral family : while both provide valid quantum descriptions , they can not be employed simultaneously ; see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sbct4.5 ] . the other stationary family for @xmath333 (",
    "again there are actually two families ) is the `` dressed @xmath231 '' family of sec .",
    "[ sbct4.2 ] .",
    "it involves a relatively rapid flipping between two orthogonal quantum states for which we do not have a simple physical interpretation . like the chiral family this one only exists for @xmath249 .    for @xmath15",
    "there is a nonstationary `` tunneling '' family in which the molecule oscillates back and forth between the two chiral states at a rate that goes to zero as @xmath242 increases to 1 . on top of this relatively smooth oscillation",
    "there are random changes in phase which constitute a nonstationary markov process , with a rate that increases with @xmath12 .",
    "this tunneling family disappears at the phase transition @xmath260 .",
    "the only truly stationary family in the regime @xmath15 is the parity family .",
    "in addition , both for @xmath15 and for @xmath249 there are a variety of nonstationary consistent families in which the orthogonal basis used to describe the quantum system tends with time towards one of the stationary families or , for @xmath15 , the tunneling family .",
    "it seems likely that most chiral molecules under most conditions will be in a regime of strong decoherence @xmath331 , see the remarks about d@xmath5s@xmath5 in sec .",
    "[ sbct6.1 ] . whereas it can only be thought of as `` chiral '' when in an appropriate rotational state , ammonia , including its deuterated form nd@xmath302 ,",
    "is an example of a tunneling molecule in which the transition at @xmath332 can be readily observed in the laboratory .",
    "indeed , it appears that it has already been observed ; see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sbct6.2 ] .",
    "one wonders if additional experiments , perhaps using technques other than , or in addition to , microwave absorption might be helpful in elucidating its behavior near the phase transtion .",
    "in addition to consistent quantum families of histories we have studied , within the scope of our simple model , the flow of information from a tunneling molecule to its environment , along with the loss of information in the molecule itself . in sec .",
    "[ sct5 ] we used a perspective in which at a later time the information about the quantum state of the molecule at an earlier time is thought of as a quantum channel , while similar information present at this later time in the environment constitutes a complementary channel .",
    "what happens in both cases depends strongly on the type of information considered .",
    "given that our model of decoherence , sec .",
    "[ sbct2.2 ] , is based on the flow of chiral ( @xmath282 ) information  is the molecule left or right handed ? to the environment , we were not surprised to find this exhibited in our quantitative measures , together with a rapid decrease of `` complementary '' types of information , corresponding to bases mutually unbiased with respect to @xmath282 , retained within the molecule itself .",
    "indeed , there is a direct quantitative relationship for short times if one uses a holevo type of information measure , and an exact equality in the instantaneous rates , , if in the holevo measure von neumann entropy is replaced with quadratic entropy in order to render the rates finite .",
    "there are a number of ways in which lines of investigation initiated in this paper could be further extended .",
    "parity - violation effects could be modeled as a small energy splitting between chiral states @xcite .",
    "also , our model contains only one mechanism for decoherence , sec .",
    "[ sct2 ] ; adding a second would allow a serious comparison with ben - reuven s formula for ammonia as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sbct6.2 ] .",
    "obtaining the correct physical interpretation might prove difficult given the complexity of the rotational states , even for ammonia present as a dilute component in a buffer gas .",
    "fluorescence from a two - level atom , where decoherence arises from spontaneous decay , could be a simpler system for studying the dynamical phase transition .",
    "this transition has been studied in terms of correlations among scattered photons in @xcite , and it would be of interest to supplement this with a description of how the atom itself behaves as a function of time . indeed , even the decay of an isolated atom initially in an excited state has not , so far as we know , been examined using consistent families , and studying them might yield valuable physical insights .",

    "the physical intuition behind this is that during this time interval the system of interest interacts only with a qubit environment , being effectively `` decoupled '' from the other environmental qubit ( we remind the reader that the most general qubit evolution requires an interaction with an environment that is represented by at least 2 qubits , see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the differential equations in are equivalent to when @xmath357 is written in polar coordinates . to obtain the differential equations for the backwards consistency condition , replace @xmath353 in with @xmath361 , corresponding to the adjoint superoperator @xmath362 , and @xmath363 with @xmath364 .",
    "the resulting differential equations are equivalent to with @xmath12 replaced with @xmath365 , thus .",
    "the consistency conditions are related to the motion in the bloch sphere of the diameter that corresponds to the ( instaneous ) orthonormal basis .",
    "however , the instantaneous hopping rate @xmath366 for the markov process can be calculated using the born rule for a very short time interval during which one can assume that the diameter remains fixed , as its motion ( the change in basis ) only contributes to higher order . when @xmath355 , @xmath366 as defined in is equal to @xmath367 .",
