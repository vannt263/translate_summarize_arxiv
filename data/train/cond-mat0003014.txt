    "the present contribution , dealing with such a general issue as the difference between insulators and metals , may appear out of place at a workshop focussing on the `` fundamental physics of ferroelectrics '' .",
    "but indeed , the present results are in a sense the ultimate developments of the theory of polarization  @xcite based on a berry phase  @xcite , which is crucial to the modern understanding of ferroelectrics  @xcite .",
    "the link between the present subject and polarization is simply stated : insulators sustain nontrivial bulk polarization , metals do not .    to the present purposes ,",
    "materials are conveniently divided in only two classes : insulators and metals .",
    "we use here the terms in a loose sense as synonym of nonconducting and conducting : an insulator is distinguished from a metal by its vanishing conductivity at low temperature and low frequency .",
    "this qualitative difference in the dc conductivity must reflect a qualitative difference in the organization of the electrons in their ground state .",
    "so the question we are going to address is : is it possible to find a _ pure ground state property _ which discriminates between an insulator and a metal ? before proceeding to answer ,",
    "let me discuss the alternative phenomenological characterization of the insulating / metallic behavior : instead of making direct reference to the dc conductivity , we address macroscopic polarization .",
    "suppose we expose a finite macroscopic sample to an electric field , say inserting it in a charged capacitor .",
    "then the induced macroscopic polarization is qualitatively different in metals and insulators . in the former materials polarization",
    "is trivial : universal , material  independent , due to surface phenomena only ( screening by free carriers )",
    ". therefore polarization in metals is _ not _ a bulk phenomenon .",
    "the opposite is true for insulators : macroscopic polarization is a nontrivial , material ",
    "dependent , bulk phenomenon .",
    "we can therefore phenomenologically characterize an insulator , in very general terms , as a material whose ground wavefunction sustains a bulk macroscopic polarization whenever the electronic hamiltonian is non centrosymmetric . from this definition",
    "it is clear that the modern theory of polarization , based on a berry s phase , can lead to a better understanding of the insulating state of matter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we briefly outline kohn s theory of the insulating state  @xcite .",
    "then we address dipole and localization for a lone electron in a born  von  krmn periodic box ; subsequently , we apply similar ideas to an extended system of @xmath0 electrons in a periodic box , addressing macroscopic polarization and electronic localization in the many  body case .",
    "we then show how this works for a crystalline system of independent electrons , and finally  following ref .",
    "@xcite  we demonstrate localization for a model correlated system displaying two different insulating phases . for the sake of simplicity , we explicitate here the relevant algebra only for the case of one  dimensional electrons .",
    "the generalization to three  dimensional electrons can be found in refs .",
    "within any classical theory , the electronic responses of insulators and metals are qualitatively described by `` bound '' and `` free '' charges , respectively . microscopic models for such charges are provided by the lorentz theory ( insulators ) and by the drude theory ( metals ) . within the former , each electron",
    "is tied ( by an harmonic force ) to a particular center ; within the latter , electrons roam freely over macroscopic distances , hindered only by atomic scattering potentials . therefore , from a purely classical model viewpoint",
    ", one explains the insulating / metallic behavior of a material by means of the localized / delocalized character of the electron distribution .",
    "switching to quantum mechanics , this clearcut character of the electron distribution is apparently lost .",
    "textbooks typically explain the insulating / metallic behavior by means of band structure theory , focussing on the position of the fermi level of the given material : either in an band gap ( insulators ) , or across a band ( metals ) .",
    "this picture is obviously correct , but very limited and somewhat misleading .",
    "first of all , the band picture applies only to a crystalline material of independent electrons : a very limited class of insulators indeed .",
    "noncrystalline insulators do in fact exist , and the electron  electron interaction is a fact of nature : in some materials the insulating behavior is dominated by disorder ( anderson insulators ) , in some other materials the insulating behavior is dominated by electron correlation ( mott insulators ) .",
    "further classes of insulators are also known , as _",
    "e.g. _ excitonic insulators .",
    "therefore , for a large number of insulators , the band picture is totally inadequate .",
    "second : even for a material where a band  structure description is adequate , the simple explanation of the insulating / metallic behavior focusses on the spectrum of the system , hence on the nature of the low lying electronic _ excitations_. instead , the qualitative difference in the dc conductivity at low temperature must reflect a qualitative difference in the organization of the electrons in their _ ground state_. such a difference is not evident in a band  structure picture : the occupied states are of the bloch form both in insulators and in metals , and qualitatively rather similar ( in particular those of simple metals and of simple semiconductors ) .    in a milestone paper published in 1964 , kohn was able to define the insulating state of matter in a way which in a sense is close to the classical picture .",
    "in fact he gave evidence that electron localization is the main feature determining the insulating behavior of a many  electron wavefunction  @xcite , thus restoring the same basic distinction as in the classical picture : the key is how to define and to measure the degree of electronic localization , visualizing in a qualitative and quantitative way the peculiar organization of the electrons which is responsible for the insulating state of matter .",
    "as previously stated , a superficial look indicates that electrons are roughly speaking equally delocalized in insulators and in metals .",
    "one needs therefore a sharp criterion which singles out the relevant character of the wavefunction .",
    "kohn s criterion is the following  @xcite : the many ",
    "electron wavefunction is localized if it breaks up into a sum of functions @xmath1 which are localized in essentially disconnected regions @xmath2 of the configuration space .",
    "any two such @xmath3 s have exponentially small overlap . under such a localization hypothesis",
    ", kohn proves that the dc conductivity vanishes .",
    "the dipole moment of any _ finite _ @xmath0electron system in its ground state is a simple and well defined quantity .",
    "given the many  body wavefunction @xmath4 and the corresponding single ",
    "particle density @xmath5 the electronic contribution to the dipole is : @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "this looks very trivial , but we are exploiting here an essential fact : the ground wavefunction of any bound @xmath0electron system is square  integrable and vanishes exponentially at infinity .",
    "going at the very essence , we simplify matter at most and we consider in the present section only a single electron in one dimension .",
    "the dipole ( or equivalently the center ) of the electronic distribution is then : @xmath8 as a square ",
    "integrable function over @xmath9 .",
    "this is not the way condensed matter theory works .",
    "because of several good reasons , in either crystalline or disordered systems it is almost mandatory to assume bvk boundary conditions : the wavefunction @xmath10 is periodic over a period @xmath11 , large with respect to atomic dimensions .",
    "adopting a given choice for the boundary conditions is tantamount to defining the hilbert space where our solutions of schrdinger s equation live . by definition , an operator maps any vector of the given hilbert space into another vector belonging to the same space : the multiplicative position operator @xmath12 is therefore _ not _ a legitimate operator when bvk are adopted for the state vectors , while any periodic function of @xmath12 is legitimate : this is the case _",
    "e.g. _ of the nuclear potential acting on the electrons .",
    "suppose we have an electron distribution such as the one in fig .",
    "the main issue is then : how do we define the center of the distribution ? intuitively , the distribution appears to have a `` center '' , which however is defined only modulo the replica periodicity , and furthermore _ can not _ be evaluated simply as in , precisely because of bvk .",
    "solutions to this and similar problems have been attempted several times : many incorrect papers  which will not be identified here  have been published over the years .",
    "the good solution has been found by selloni _",
    "_ in 1987 by means of a very elegant and far  reaching formula  @xcite .",
    "according to them , the key quantity for dealing with the position operator within bvk is the dimensionless complex number @xmath13 , defined as : @xmath14 whose modulus is no larger than 1 .",
    "the most general electron density , such as the one depicted in fig .  [ loc ] , can always be written as a superposition of a function @xmath15 , normalized over @xmath16 , and of its periodic replicas : @xmath17 both @xmath18 and @xmath19 have a large arbitrariness : we restrict it a little bit by imposing that @xmath18 is the center of the distribution , in the sense that @xmath20 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ replicas ] ) , @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of the fourier transform of @xmath21 as : @xmath22 if the electron is localized in a region of space much smaller than @xmath11 , its fourier transform is smooth over reciprocal distances of the order of @xmath23 and can be expanded as : @xmath24 a very natural definition of the center of a localized periodic distribution @xmath25 is therefore provided by the phase of @xmath13 as : @xmath26 which is in fact the formula first proposed by selloni _",
    "_  @xcite . the expectation value @xmath27 is defined modulo @xmath11 , as expected since @xmath25 is bvk periodic .",
    "it is also worth to observe that for an extremely delocalized state we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 : hence the center of the distribution @xmath27 , according to , is ill  defined , as one would indeed expect .",
    "so far , we have not specified which hamiltonian we were addressing when discussing electron distributions @xmath25 of the kind depicted in fig .",
    "it is however obvious to imagine that the wavefunction @xmath10 is the eigenstate of a ( periodically repeated ) potential well of suitable shape .",
    "suppose for a moment we are _ not _ adopting bvk boundary conditions , having thus only a genuinely isolated potential well .",
    "in this case the eigenstates can belong to two different classes : bound ( localized ) states , and scattering ( delocalized ) states .",
    "the distinction is a qualitatively clearcut one , and can be stated in several ways .",
    "one of them is to consider the second cumulant moment , or spread : @xmath30 which is finite for bound states and divergent ( when using appropriate normalizations ) for scattering ones .",
    "but if we study the same potential well within bvk , the qualitative distinction is lost : all states appear in a sense as `` delocalized '' since all wavefunctions @xmath10 are periodic over the bvk period . and in fact the integrals in become ill defined .",
    "the main issues therefore are : how do we distinguish between localized and delocalized states within bvk ? in case of a localized state , how we actually measure the amount of localization ? in the literature ,",
    "such issues have been previously addressed by means of the participation ratio  @xcite .",
    "the complex number @xmath13 , whose phase provides the center of the distribution , , is our key to addressing localization : it is enough to consider its modulus .",
    "it has already been observed that @xmath31 is bounded between 0 and 1 , and that @xmath31 equals zero for an extremely delocalized state with @xmath28 .",
    "if we take instead an extremely localized state , with @xmath32 , it is straightforward to get @xmath33 .",
    "it is therefore natural to measure localization by means of the negative of the logarithm of @xmath31 : it is a nonnegative number , equal to zero in the case of extreme localization , and divergent in the case of extreme delocalization . a glance at yields : @xmath34 hence a natural expression for measuring the actual spread within bvk is : @xmath35 having in mind again the eigenstates of a potential well , we can study the expression in as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "for a localized state , the shape of of @xmath36 can be taken as @xmath11independent for large @xmath11 , hence goes to a finite limit , which is the `` natural '' spread of the distribution .",
    "quite on the contrary , for a delocalized state the distribution is smeared all over the @xmath37 segment , preserving the norm over one period : therefore @xmath13 goes to zero and the spread diverges in the large@xmath11 limit .",
    "so much about the one  electron problem : we are now going to consider a finite density of electrons in the periodic box . to start with",
    ", irrelevant spin variables will be neglected , and a system of spinless electrons in one dimension is considered . even for a system of independent electrons ,",
    "our approach takes a simple and compact form if a many  body formulation is adopted ; bvk imposes periodicity in each electronic variable separately .",
    "our interest is in studying a bulk system : @xmath0 electrons in a segment of length @xmath11 , where eventually the thermodynamic limit is taken : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 constant .",
    "we start defining the one  dimensional analogue of @xmath41 of , namely , the multiplicative operator @xmath42 , and the complex number @xmath43 it is obvious that the operator @xmath44 is ill  defined in our hilbert space , while its complex exponential appearing in is well defined .",
    "the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the ground ",
    "state expectation value of the position operator is given by the analogue of , namely : @xmath45 a quantity defined modulo @xmath11 as above .",
    "the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) is not simply the expectation value of an operator : it is the _ phase _ of it , converted into length units by the factor @xmath46 .",
    "this phase can be called a single  point berry phase , for reasons explained elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the main ingredient of is the expectation value of the multiplicative operator @xmath47 : it is important to realize that this is a genuine _ many  body _ operator . in general",
    ", one defines an operator to be one ",
    "body whenever it is the _ sum _ of @xmath0 identical operators , acting on each electronic coordinate separately : for instance , the @xmath44 operator is such . in order to express the expectation value of a one  body operator the full many  body wavefunction",
    "is not needed : knowledge of the one  body reduced density matrix @xmath48 is enough : i stress that , instead , the expectation value of @xmath49 over a correlated wavefunction _ can not _ be expressed in terms of @xmath48 , and knowledge of the @xmath0-electron wavefunction is explicitly needed . in the special case of a single  determinant ,",
    "the @xmath0-particle wavefunction is uniquely determined by the one  body reduced density matrix @xmath48 ( which is the projector over the set of the occupied single  particle orbitals ) : therefore the expectation value @xmath50 , , is uniquely determined by @xmath48 .",
    "but this is peculiar to uncorrelated wavefunctions only .",
    "the expectation value @xmath51 is extensive , as the dipole in . for the corresponding intensive quantity we borrow from ref .",
    "@xcite a useful notation : @xmath52 where the subscript means `` cumulant '' .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 goes to a well defined termodynamic limit , which is in fact proportional to the macroscopic polarization of the system .",
    "this result is proved in ref .",
    "@xcite ; its three dimensional generalization is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we stress that nowhere have we assumed crystalline periodicity .",
    "therefore our definition of @xmath54 is very general : it applies to any condensed system , either ordered or disordered , either independent  electron or correlated . in the special case of a crystalline system , either interacting or noninteracting , the present approach can be shown equivalent to the previous formulations of polarization theory  @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to discuss electron localization in a condensed system : the present view is the one of refs .",
    "@xcite , recently reexamined by souza _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who also discuss its relationship to kohn s localization@xcite .",
    "this view is based on the modulus of @xmath55 , in full analogy with the previous section about the single electron .",
    "we define therefore an intensive quantity , the second cumulant moment , by analogy with : @xmath56 where again the notation is borrowed from ref .",
    "this second moment is a very meaningful measure of electron localization in the electronic ground wavefunction , and enjoys two important properties : ( 1 ) when applied to a crystalline system of independent electrons , we recover an important gauge  invariant quantity which controls the marzari  vanderbilt localization  @xcite ; ( 2 ) even for more general systems , correlated and/or disordered , @xmath57 assumes a finite value in insulators , and diverges in metals . indeed in a metal",
    "the modulus of @xmath55 goes to zero in such a way that its phase is ill defined , and hence macroscopic polarization is ill defined as well .",
    "we have emphasized throughout this paper that one of the main phenomenological features differentiating insulators from metals is that the former materials sustain a nontrivial bulk polarization , while the latter do not .",
    "the complex number @xmath55 provides the key formal link between polarization and localization , via its phase and its modulus .",
    "for independent electrons , we may write the many  body wavefunction @xmath4 as a slater determinant of bloch orbitals , but in the case of a metal not all the bloch vectors in the reciprocal cell correspond to occupied orbitals : this fact is of overwhelming importance .",
    "we consider the simple case of one band in one dimension , whose bloch vectors are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : discre2 ] , imposing bvk boundary conditions over @xmath58 cristal cells : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the lattice constant .",
    "we restore electron spin here : we get an insulator if the number of electrons @xmath0 equals @xmath61 ( filled band , top sketch ) , and a metal if @xmath62 ( half  filled band , bottom sketch ) .",
    "both in the insulating and in the metallic case the @xmath0electron wavefunction is a slater determinant of size @xmath0 , built of @xmath63 doubly occupied spatial orbitals .",
    "following the same algebra as in refs .",
    "@xcite , the complex number @xmath55 can be written in any case ( insulator or metal ) by means of the determinant of a matrix @xmath64 whose elements are @xmath65 and these elements are nonzero whenever @xmath66 .",
    "( 14,3.5 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 0.9,2)@xmath67 ( 12,2)@xmath68 ( 13,2.4)@xmath69 ( 13,0.4)@xmath69    in the insulating case , owing to complete filling , both @xmath70 and @xmath71 run over all the @xmath58 values : for any given @xmath70 , there is always one ( and only one ) @xmath71 such that the matrix element in is nonzero .",
    "that means that in any row of the @xmath72 matrix  whose size is @xmath73there is one , and only one , nonvanishing element . under these circumstances , the determinant factors as a product of @xmath58 numbers : @xmath74 where the identity @xmath75 is understood ( periodic gauge ) .",
    "all the factors are nonvanishing , and the logarithm of @xmath55 is therefore a finite number . it can be shown that the @xmath39 limit of @xmath76 coincides with the spread of the optimally localized wannier functions , as defined by marzari and vanderbilt  @xcite .",
    "the metallic case is very different .",
    "since not all the @xmath77 vectors are occupied , the indices @xmath70 and @xmath71 run over a subset of the @xmath58 values ( fig .  [ fig : discre2 ] ) : the matrix @xmath72 is of size @xmath78 .",
    "there is one of the two @xmath77 at the fermi level , for which the integrals in are all vanishing , for any _ occupied _ @xmath71 . therefore the matrix @xmath72 has a row of zeros , and its determinant vanishes : its phase , and hence macroscopic polarization , is ill defined .",
    "the logarithm of @xmath55 is formally @xmath79 , and the spread @xmath57 diverges to @xmath80 .",
    "this is what we expected for a metal ; the nontrivial fact is that it diverges _ even at finite @xmath0 _ , while on general grounds we only expected it to diverge in the thermodynamic ( @xmath39 ) limit .",
    "so far , the compact and elegant expression of has been proved to be appropriate to discriminate between insulators and metals only for a crystalline systems of independent electrons . for the  much more interesting  general case of a correlated and/or disordered system ,",
    "we _ postulate _ that performs the same task .",
    "the postulate is based on the general argument  much stressed above  about macroscopic polarization : well defined in insulators , ill defined in metals ( as a bulk property ) .",
    "the correctness of this postulate has been verified by resta and sorella @xcite for a one  dimensional model of a correlated crystal .",
    "work on a model disordered system is in progress .",
    "other very interesting discussions about the physical meaning of @xmath57 and its relationships to the insulating / metallic character of the system can be found in a paper of souza _ et al .",
    "we review here the very recent work of resta and sorella @xcite , where is implemented for a one  dimensional two  band hubbard model at half filling , intended to mimic an insulator having a mixed ionic / covalent character , and whose ground wavefunction is explicitly correlated .",
    "the macroscopic polarization of this model system was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . to the present purpose ,",
    "it is enough to study the centrosymmetric geometry : polarization is zero , the wavefunction is real , and the phase of @xmath55 is either 0 or @xmath81 .",
    "the model has a very interesting behavior as a function of @xmath82 : at small @xmath82 it is a band insulator , while at a critical @xmath83 undergoes a transition to a mott  like insulating phase . in the centrosymmetric geometry , @xmath84 is a real number , which changes sign at @xmath83 .",
    "its phase @xmath85 ( _ i.e. _ the single ",
    "point berry phase  @xcite ) jumps therefore by @xmath81 : it turns out that this occurrence is the main fact signalling the transition : the topological quantum number @xmath86 can be used as an order parameter to identify the two different phases of the system  @xcite . at low values of @xmath82 our model is a band insulator , while above @xmath83 is a mott  like insulator .",
    "what happens to the second cumulant moment ( squared localization length ) @xmath76 as a function of @xmath82 ?",

    "no wannier analysis can be performed ; yet @xmath57 mantains its role as a meaningful measure of the localization of the electronic wavefunction as a whole .",
    "the localization length increases with @xmath82 below the transition , diverges at the transition point @xmath83 , and becomes localized again in the highly correlated regime , where in fact @xmath57 decreases with increasing @xmath82 .",
    "since the localization length remains finite at all values of @xmath82 different from @xmath83 , the system is always insulating except at the transition point ; the two insulating phases are topologically different and correspond to a qualitatively different organization of the electrons in the wavefunction  @xcite .    what about the transition point ?",
    "according to the previously stated viewpoint , the delocalized behavior implies a metallic character of the many  electron system .",
    "notice that @xmath57 is a pure ground state property and apparently carries no information about the excitation spectrum of the system .",
    "yet we have explicitly verified  by exploiting the metastability of the lanczos algorithm  that at the critical @xmath82 value there is indeed a level crossing . at the transition value @xmath83 the ground state",
    "is twice degenerate and the lowest lying excitation ( at constant @xmath0 ) has vanishing energy .",
