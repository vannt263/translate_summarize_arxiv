    "as regards x13 , we only took a spectrum of a stellar roe object with b mag 18.5 close ( 7@xmath36 ) to x13 , though clearly outside the error circle , the stellar object close by being to faint for spectroscopic follow - up with this instrumentation . by comparing with the library of stellar spectra of jacoby et al .",

    "<S> we report the results of a deep spatial , spectral , and timing analysis of rosat hri and pspc observations of the edge - on starburst galaxy ngc  253 . in this first paper , </S>",
    "<S> point - like x - ray sources detected within the galaxy and in the field are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the sources are characterized by their x - ray properties ( including comparisons with results from the _ einstein _ and asca satellites ) , by correlations with other wavelength and some optical spectroscopic follow up observations .    in total , 73 x - ray sources have been collected in the ngc  253 field , 32 of which are associated with the disk of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> though 27 of these disk sources are detected with the hri ( some being resolvable with the pspc ) , the remaining 5 pspc - only detected sources are likely not to be real point sources , being instead due to fluctuations within the x - ray structure of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the source close to the center of the galaxy is extended ( @xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 in the rosat 0.12.4  kev band ) , and is most likely associated with the nuclear starburst activity . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining sources have luminosities ranging from @xmath2  erg  s@xmath1 to @xmath3  erg  s@xmath1 , yielding an integrated point source luminosity of @xmath4  erg  s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest point - like source is located @xmath5 south of the nucleus , at the border of a plume of diffuse x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> its high x - ray luminosity , time variability and hard spectrum make it a good candidate for a black hole x - ray binary .    </S>",
    "<S> including four _ einstein _ detections of x - ray transients the number of point - like x - ray sources in ngc  253 increases to 30 sources , 13 of which are time variable . these time variable sources are all brighter than @xmath6  erg  s@xmath1 and most likely represent x - ray binaries radiating close to or at the eddington limit . </S>",
    "<S> besides the nuclear source there is only one source above this luminosity that shows no time variability and therefore may represent a young supernova or extremely bright supernova remnant , or an unresolved cluster of several x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> the point source population of ngc  253 is compared to that of other galaxies , and it is shown that the luminosity distribution matches rosat results obtained for m  31 and m  33 .    the halo of ngc  253 is filled with diffuse , filamentary x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> seven sources are located ( or projected ) in this diffuse emission region . </S>",
    "<S> time variability arguments , together with optical identifications , are put forward to explain 4 sources as background objects , the other 3 sources likely being spurious detections caused by local enhancements in the diffuse emission of the halo of ngc  253 . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse x - ray emission components of ngc  253 will be discussed in a separate paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the sources detected in the field outside the disk of ngc  253 cover a flux range from @xmath7 in the 0.12.4 kev band . </S>",
    "<S> none of the sources in the field correlate with published lists of globular cluster candidates . </S>",
    "<S> optical counterparts are proposed for 27 of them , and a few also correlate with radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> while two sources are identified as foreground stars , the remaining ones are mostly background active galactic nuclei . </S>"
