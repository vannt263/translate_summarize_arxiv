    "very soft x - ray sources ( vsss ) were observed by the _ einstein x - ray observatory _ in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ; long , helfand , & grabelsky 1981 ; seward & mitchell 1981 ) .",
    "rosat s _ _ all sky survey _ discovered roughly @xmath7 such soft x - ray , sources in the mcs , m31 , and in the galaxy , the class of luminous supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) was established .",
    "( see trmper et al .",
    "1991 , supper et al 1997 , and references in greiner 2000 . )",
    "the luminosities of the first ssss to be discovered were in the range from @xmath8 ergs s@xmath2 to a few times @xmath9 ergs s@xmath2 , with @xmath3 in the range of tens of ev . with the advent of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton , _ the study of ssss can be extended to more distant galaxies .",
    "we have therefore developed a systematic method to select soft sources from the pool of all x - ray sources detected by either _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ in an external galaxy (  & kong 2003 a , b , c ) .",
    "we have applied this algorithm to m31 (  et al .",
    "2003 a ) ; m104 (  et al .",
    "2003 b ) ; ngc 300 ( kong &  2003 ) ; m101 , m83 , m51 , ngc 4697 (  & kong 2003 c ) ; and ngc 4472 ( friedman et al .",
    "we find that the algorithm selects not only ssss , but also members of a new class of sources which have been dubbed _",
    "quasisoft sources _ ( qsss ) .",
    "qsss are luminous ( @xmath10 typically @xmath11 erg s@xmath2 ) sources that appear to be slightly harder ( @xmath12 ev ) than ssss , yet soft enough that their emission falls off at energies well below the energies characteristic of canonical x - ray binaries .",
    "we use the term vss for any source that is either supersoft or quasisoft .",
    "the measured values of @xmath10 and @xmath13 suggest white dwarf ( wd ) models . indeed , almost half of the local ssss with optical ids are systems housing a hot wd or pre - wd ( e.g. , recent novae , symbiotics , planetary nebulae ) .",
    "( see greiner s [ 2000 ] sss catalog . )",
    "perhaps the most promising model for the remaining @xmath14 ssss with optical ids is one in which a roche - lobe - filling companion donates mass to a wd at rates high enough to allow quasi - steady nuclear burning ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "1992 ; rappaport  & smith 1994 ) .",
    "matter which is burned can increase the mass of the wd , potentially leading to a type ia supernova explosion",
    ". nevertheless , neutron star ( ns ) models are not excluded ( kylafis & xilouris 1993 ) , and there have been suggestions that some of the local ssss may be accreting stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ; cowley , schmidtke , crampton , & hutchings 1990 , 1998 ; hutchings , crampton , cowley , & schmidtke 1998 ) .    in external galaxies",
    "we can study the positions of ssss relative to other galaxy inhabitants . in m101 , m83 , and m51 ,",
    "some ssss are located in the spiral arms , some close to markers of young stellar populations . while some of these may be supernova remnants , the fact that many ssss in external galaxies are variable suggests that are x - ray binaries .",
    "( variability studies have been possible so far for ssss in m31 and for the high-@xmath10 sources in a handful of nearby galaxies . )",
    "at least some accretors may therefore be nss or bhs in young ( @xmath15 yrs ) .",
    "in addition , some ssss are ultraluminous , suggesting accretion onto an intermediate mass ( @xmath16 ) bh .",
    "the ultraluminous ssss represent an extension of the sss class to luminosities so high that the accretors are almost certainly not wds . in an analogous way",
    ", qsss represent an extension to higher energy emission that also appears to be inconsistent with wd models .",
    "as discussed below ( see eq .  1 )",
    ", both the extension to higher luminosities and the extension to higher temperatures are consistent with models of accreting intermediate - mass bhs ( imbhs ) .",
    "there are ssss positioned within a few parsecs of the central black holes of some galaxies ( e.g. , m31 [ garcia et al .",
    "2000 ; kong et al . 2002",
    "] ) ; these may be the stripped cores of tidally disrupted giants (  et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the luminosity and temperature of nuclear burning wds both increase with the wd mass . since the wd mass can not be larger than @xmath17 the eddington limit places an upper bound on the luminosity of @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 . because the photospheric radius has a lower bound equal to the wd radius , this places an upper bound on the effective temperature of approximately @xmath4 ev .",
    "in fact , this temperature is not likely to be achieved by a nuclear - burning wd , since the photosphere is generally above the wd s surface .",
    "sources with higher @xmath13 and effective radii too small to be consistent with wds , are likely to be accreting nss or bhs .",
    "ns or stellar - mass bh accretors do not seem natural , because the photospheric radii would be @xmath19 orders of magnitude larger than the ns or schwarzschild radii .",
    "there is , however , one natural model : if the accretor is an imbh , then the temperature and luminosities are expected to be in the range observed for both ssss and qsss .",
    "let @xmath20 be the mass of the accreting bh , and let @xmath21 be the efficiency , with @xmath22 if we assume that the accretion is mediated by a thin disk , and that the disk is optically thick , with its inner edge coincident with the radius of the last stable orbit , then the temperature of the inner disk can be written as follows . @xmath23",
    "a better model is a multi - color disk , generally with a power law tail ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) . using a more sophisticated model than the one that produced eq .  1",
    ", by , e.g. , taking effects such as spectral hardening or the possible bh spin into account , would tend to increase the estimated bh mass for any set of measured values of @xmath3 or @xmath10 ; this is the reason for the inequality .",
    "the higher the mass of the bh , the lower the temperature .",
    "only one sss has been detected in a galactic globular cluster ( gc ) .",
    "1e 1339.8 + 2837 , located in m3 ( ngc 5272 ) , was observed both in the rosat all - sky survey ( verbunt et al .",
    "1995 ) , and in pointed observations using the hri ( hertz , grindlay & bailyn 1993 ) .",
    "estimates of the temperature and bolometric luminosity based on the all - sky survey were @xmath24 ev , and @xmath25 erg s@xmath2 ( verbunt et al . 1995 ) ; estimates based on the hri observations were @xmath26 ev and @xmath27 erg s@xmath2 ( hertz et al .",
    "the source is a transient .",
    "note that the inferred luminosity ( though uncertain ) is smaller than typical for ssss found in the galaxy , the mcs , and m31 .",
    "this source could be similar to v751 cyg , a nova - like variable of the vy scl class , which becomes a low-@xmath10 sss only during rare optical low states ( greiner et al .",
    "1999 , greiner &  1999 ) .",
    "because gcs have been well - studied at x - ray wavelengths , we can determine whether systems like 1e 1339.8 + 2837 are common . by carrying out simulations",
    "in which gcs were `` seeded '' with ssss ( see  & rappaport 1994 for details ) ,  & davies ( 1996 ) concluded that _ rosat _ observations of gcs should have produced an almost complete census of any active gc ssss with characteristics similar to either 1e 1339.8 + 2837 or to the other known ssss .",
    "thus , ssss in galactic gcs are rare .",
    "globular clusters have per capita populations of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) roughly @xmath28 times larger than in the galactic disk .",
    "the enhancement is due to stellar interactions within or near the dense cluster cores .",
    "if the same ratio held for ssss , then there would be @xmath29 ssss in galactic gcs .",
    "with just one observed , we can rule out the possibility that the stellar interactions are producing significant enhancements in the numbers of gc ssss .",
    "it is nevertheless worth noting that ssss _ can _ be produced by @xmath30 or @xmath31 body interactions in gcs .",
    "the donor star would be a blue straggler , formed through the merging of two lower - mass stars .",
    "( in fact , m3 is rich in blue stragglers [ guhathakurta et al .",
    "distefano & davies ( 1996 ) carried out simulations of the formation and binary evolution of gc systems that could become ssss .",
    "they found that there should ne @xmath32 sss in galactic gcs , comparable to predictions of the numbers of ssss expected due to ordinary binary evolution , and consistent with the x - ray observations . in addition , gc ssss were likely to have values of @xmath33 below the steady - burning region , and should therefore appear as sss transients .",
    "ngc 4472 is a giant elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster .",
    "it houses about 6000 gcs ( rhode & zepf 2001 ) . _ chandra _ discovered 144 x - ray sources in an @xmath34 region near the center of the galaxy ( kundu et al .",
    "2002 ; maccarone , kundu , & zepf 2003 ) .",
    "there are more than 800 gcs in the region that _",
    "observed ( kundu & whitmore 2001 ) . in the regions studied by both _",
    "chandra _ and _ hst _ , 40% of the bright ( @xmath35 erg s@xmath2 ) x - ray sources are associated with optically identified gcs ( kundu et al .",
    "2002 ; maccarone , kundu , & zepf 2003 ) .",
    "we conducted an independent analysis with two new elements .",
    "first , we considered data from all @xmath0 ccds .",
    "second , we ran the detection algorithm ( wavdetect ) for energies in the range @xmath36 kev , rather than @xmath37 kev . because emission from the softest sources begins to fall off by @xmath38 kev , photons below @xmath38 kev may combine with photons of higher energies , to make detections possible . to ensure that none of the sources are artifacts , we visually inspected the region containing each source , to verify that the spatial distribution of photons was consistent with the psf at the source location .",
    "we used lists of hst - identified gcs from kundu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and of spectroscopically studied gcs from sharples et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and zepf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . to conduct a search for gcs in the vicinity of each x - ray source",
    ", we considered a sequence of search cones of radius @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath39 was @xmath41 using this value we found @xmath42 gcs near x - ray sources . an analysis using random shifts of the x - ray source positions , found that that @xmath43 identifications are likely to be due to chance superpositions .",
    "we applied a uniform selection procedure ( distefano & kong 2003a , b ) to determine which x - ray sources are vsss .",
    "our selection algorithm identified @xmath44 ssss in ngc 4472 .",
    "six of these are associated with gcs .",
    "some of the vss - gc pairs may be artifacts .",
    "since , however , we have estimated the number of spurious pairings to be @xmath0 , it is unlikely that all @xmath0 false matches involve vsss .",
    "we therefore conclude that at least several of the vss - gc matches represent genuine physical correspondences .",
    "table 1 lists the ssss identified with ngc 4472 s gcs .",
    "sources @xmath31 and @xmath45 were identified as ssss ; the remaining sources were identified as qsss .",
    "some of the vsss may be background active galactic nuclei .",
    "we used results from the chandra deep field surveys ( e.g. , brandt et al .",
    "2001 ; giacconi et al .",
    "2001 ) to find that , at @xmath46 erg s@xmath2 ( the completeness limit ) , fewer than 10 sources are likely to be background objects .",
    "we expect that only a small fraction of these are soft enough to be identified as vsss . to quantify this , we studied data from several fields observed by _",
    "chandra _ and find that @xmath47 vsss unrelated to ngc 4472 are likely to be present in our data ; these are most likely to be foreground stars ( see e.g. distefano et al .",
    "2003a and kong et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we have also investigated the optical properties of the gcs that house vsss .",
    "we find that the vsss are preferentially in luminous clusters .",
    "this parallels results for x - ray sources in general .",
    "( see e.g. ,  et al .",
    "the vsss are found in both metal - poor and metal - rich gcs .",
    "because the portion of the galaxy for which we have gc positions is just a small portion of the region covered by the _ chandra _ observations , any estimate of the fraction of x - ray sources residing in gcs is highly uncertain .",
    "note however , that roughly @xmath48 of the ssss and @xmath49 of all x - ray sources are associated with gcs .",
    "the fact that these @xmath50 ratios are similar , and that , as in our galaxy , the x - ray sources are over - represented in gcs of by a factor of @xmath51 suggests that x - ray sources in general , and ssss in particular , are produced in the gcs of ngc 4472 through interactions .",
    "this is different from the situation in the milky way , where x - ray sources in general , but not ssss , are overproduced in gcs .",
    "the number of counts from each gc sss is too small to permit a spectral fit .",
    "we can , however , compare the distribution of counts from each source in the s ( 0.1 - 1.1 kev ) , m ( 1.1 - 2 kev ) , and h ( 2 - 7 kev ) bands , with the distributions expected from known models .",
    "to this end , we used pimms ( ao3 release ) to compute the numbers of counts expected in s , m , and h from a blackbody source in ngc 4472 , located behind a column with @xmath52 equal to each of @xmath31 values : ( @xmath53 @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xmath54 , @xmath56 @xmath54 and @xmath57 @xmath54 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath3 we considered ranged from 25 ev to 100 ev in 15 ev increments , then to 250 ev is @xmath58 ev increments , and then to 500 ev and beyond by increments of 250ev . for each vss , we scaled the luminosity of the model source so that it produced the same total number of counts .",
    "if the computed counts in each band were within @xmath59 of the observed counts , we counted the model as a possible match .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the softest source is source 5 , with the associated models shown as magenta pentagons .",
    "the fits are highly degenerate .",
    "source @xmath45 could be either an ultraluminous source with a very low value of @xmath3 , or a source with the characteristics of a classical sss . in the latter case ,",
    "it is likely to have @xmath3 near or just under @xmath28 ev , and to have @xmath10 close to the eddington limit for a @xmath60 object .",
    "thus , this particular sss could be an accreting high - mass wd , perhaps a good candidate for the progenitor af a type ia supernova explosion .",
    "it has not been anticipated that gcs serve as sites of type ia sne .",
    "nevertheless , we can construct scenarios in which progenitors can be formed in gcs .",
    "if the sss is wd binary with orbital period less than a few days , it is likely that the donor is a @xmath61 star that may be slightly evolved .",
    "this is possible if the cluster is young , or if the donor is a blue straggler ( see  1.2.2 ) .",
    "if , instead , source @xmath45 is very soft ( with @xmath3 possibly as low as @xmath62 ev ) , and very luminous , then the most likely interpretation is that it is an imbh , with mass that could be as high as @xmath63 although the presence of imbhs in gcs has been suggested , the more conservative model for this source is likely to be the wd model .",
    "source @xmath31 ( cyan boxes ) is also chosen as an sss .",
    "it appears to be not as soft as source @xmath45 ; values of @xmath64 ev are ruled out .",
    "this means that the range of possible luminosities is also more restricted . if source @xmath31 is a nuclear - burning wd it is marginally hotter , while at the same time being somewhat less luminous , than expected for a high - mass wd . in fact ,",
    "source @xmath31 is consistent with models very similar to those that apply to the qsss , discussed below .",
    "the qsss appear to be too hot to be compatible with wd models .",
    "the associated values of @xmath3 appear to be clustered between roughly @xmath4 ev and @xmath5 ev , while the luminosities all lie near @xmath9 erg s@xmath2 . although the nature of these sources is not determined , imbh models are well suited to them .",
    "the minimum computed values of the bh masses range from approximately @xmath65 to @xmath66 the mass accretion rates would be similar among the systems , around @xmath67 yr@xmath2 .",
    "one vss has already been associated with a gc in the sombrero galaxy , m104 (  et al .",
    "nevertheless , the discovery of a set of vsss in the gcs of ngc 4472 is remarkable .",
    "first , the discovery of @xmath0 vss - gc matches rules out the possibility that all of them are spurious . in combination with the m104 results ,",
    "we can now more firmly establish that gcs do house luminous ( @xmath68 erg s@xmath2 ) vsss .",
    "there is no precedent for this in the galaxy or in m31 .",
    "second , our ngc 4472 results provide examples of vss - gc matches in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "third , the set of gc - vsss allows us to begin studying the statistics of this connection .",
    "much more data , from a larger number of galaxies is needed .",
    "but , e.g. , if it remains the case that there is no obvious connection between gc metalicity and the likelihood of hosting an sss , this would be a significant contrast with other x - ray binaries , suggesting that different processes create the vsss than those that create other x - ray binaries .",
    "if some of the vsss in gcs are wds accreting matter at high enough rates to allow nuclear burning , then type ia sne may occur in gcs .",
    "young gcs , or extremely massive centrally dense gcs would be favored .",
    "if type ia supernovae can occur in gcs , it is possible that surveys designed to study type ia supernovae will discover an example .",
    "most sources in the range @xmath12 ev sources are likely not hot wds .",
    "the most natural alternatives are accreting imbhs .",
    "it is interesting that the properties of the qsss in gcs seem roughly similar across clusters , and that the minimum values of the bh masses are also similar ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the presence of imbhs in gcs has been predicted by a number of authors .",
    "dynamical evidence for such bhs in m15 and g1 has been offered ( gerssen et al .",
    "2002 ; gebhardt , rich , & ho 2002 ) , although these results have generated some controversy ( mcnamara , harrison , & anderson 2003 ; baumgardt et al .",
    ". the discovery of ssss , and especially of qsss , in gcs may provide independent observational evidence that bhs with masses larger than standard stellar remnants do inhabit gcs . if so , studies like the one described here will provide an avenue to establish the statistics and general properties of the connection between globular clusters and intermediate - mass black holes .",
