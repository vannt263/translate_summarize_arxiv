    "transition radiation theory describes those radiative phenomena produced by high energy charged particles crossing the interface between two media with different dielectric properties .",
    "typical transition radiation events are represented by relativistic charged particles crossing in the vacuum a thin metallic layer . as natural extension",
    ", such a category of events also includes the diffraction radiation phenomena , i.e. , the radiative mechanisms observed when a charged beam passes through a circular or rectangular slit over a metallic screen .    in the past few years the transition radiation theory , based on the _ single particle _ formalism describing a point - like charge colliding with an ideal metallic target of infinite size @xcite , attracted much interest in those aspects concerning the diffractive modifications affecting such formalism as the finite size of the screen is considered @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to contribute to an extension of the transition radiation theory by including in the formalism the _ source size _ effects arising as the charged beam can be realistically described by a three - dimensional probability distribution .",
    "the _ pseudophotons method _ , describing the transition radiation produced by a high energy beam as a radiation field scattered off a metallic screen , is a powerful formalism @xcite allowing to calculate the diffractive modifications in the spectrum due to the finite size of the metallic target and/or to the presence of a slit on it . in the framework of such a formalism and supposing - as reasonable in practical situations - the linear size of the detector surface much smaller than the distance between the scattering surface and the detector itself ( _ far field approximation _ ) , the complete formal expression of the transition radiation spectrum produced by a three - dimensional electron bunch colliding with a metallic target is obtained in this paper . as different from the classical articles @xcite , which are dedicated to the collective effects observable at long wave - length in the synchrotron radiation spectrum emitted by one - dimensional electron beam with zero transverse dimension moving on a circular orbit , the present paper treats",
    "transition radiative phenomena concerning three - dimensional charged beam and , consequently , derives physical consequences .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the synchrotron radiation spectrum emitted by @xmath0 electrons , collected in a longitudinally extended bunch with zero transverse dimension moving on a circular orbit , is described by the following expression @xmath1\\label{coe},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 - the intensity per frequency unit - is related to the radiative mechanism produced by the single electron in the bunch ( _ single particle spectrum _ ) .",
    "the _ longitudinal form factor _",
    "@xmath3 can be stated - in the limit of a continuous charge distribution - as the squared module of the fourier transform of the longitudinal probability distribution function @xmath4 : @xmath5 due to its relativistic origin , eq.([coe ] ) continues to maintain its validity for one - dimensional beams if , instead of considering the synchrotron radiative mechanism , we consider the transition one .",
    "then , we assume that the @xmath0 electrons - collected in a three - dimensional bunch and in linear uniform motion with common velocity @xmath6 - hit normally a flat metallic screen producing forward and backward transition radiation . whether the procedure of substituting in ( [ coe ] ) the _ longitudinal form factor _ ( [ ff ] ) with a three - dimensional one @xmath7 is the correct one when the charged beam is described by a three - dimensional continuous probability distribution function @xmath8 , represents the subject of the following part of this paper .",
    "the frequency distribution of the transition radiation intensity can be obtained describing the radiative mechanism in terms of the _ pseudophotons method _ @xcite , which allows to directly include in the calculations also screen size effects . according to the _ huygens - fresnel principle _",
    ", the transition radiation field can be therefore imagined as the diffractive propagation of a _ pseudophotons _",
    "field scattered off the metallic screen . in practice",
    "the harmonic components of the transition radiation field , meant as scattered components of the transverse electromagnetic ( e.m . ) field moving with the charge , can be analytically expressed via the _ integral theorem of helmholtz and kirchhoff _ @xcite .",
    "such integrals , under the assumption of the _ far field approximation _ , can be simply calculated @xcite by fourier transforming the _ pseudophotons _ field components with respect to the coordinates @xmath9 of the metallic target surface @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , at large distance @xmath11 from the target the transition radiation electric field components @xmath12 , expressed in terms of the corresponding components @xmath13 of the scattered _ pseudophotons _ field , are : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the module of the transition radiation wave - vector in a non - dispersive medium with phase - velocity @xmath16 .      before expressing the _ pseudophotons _ field ( @xmath17 ) in terms of the the e.m .",
    "field ( @xmath18 ) travelling with the electron bunch , it is better to make clear the scenario",
    ".    it is assumed that a charged beam , moving along the @xmath19 axis with constant velocity @xmath20 , hits a flat surface @xmath10 , made of an ideal conductor ( dielectric constant @xmath21 ) and lying on the @xmath22 plane of the reference frame .",
    "a non - dispersive medium with permeability @xmath23 and characteristic phase velocity @xmath24 surrounds the surface .",
    "furthermore it is assumed that @xmath0 electrons , forming a three - dimensional bunch at rest with respect to the center - of - mass frame , are described by a distribution function @xmath8 `` frozen '' in time : @xmath25 this assumption , in accordance with the observation that the radiative process at a given time only depends on those electrons in the bunch hitting at the same time the metallic screen , corresponds to treat the @xmath0 electrons as uncorrelated and described by a probability distribution function and a corresponding fourier transform expressed as : @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the fourier transform of the electric field moving with the charge is @xmath28}% { [ k_x^2+k_y^2+k_z^2-(\\omega / v)^2]}\\rho(\\vec{k})% \\delta(\\omega-\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{w}),\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{elec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the longitudinal field component @xmath29 , proportional to the reciprocal of the square of the relativistic lorentz factor @xmath30 , can be neglected with respect to the electric field components @xmath31 transverse to the charge velocity @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the harmonic components of the transverse electric field traveling with the charge follows from eq.([elec ] ) : @xmath32},\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{carica}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .",
    "the _ pseudophotons _ field can be finally derived from the constraint of the boundary conditions over the metallic surface imposed on the transverse component of the total field : @xmath34 then from eq.([bound ] ) the explicit expression of the harmonic components of the _ pseudophotons _ field is : @xmath35}.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{esplipse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      with respect to a spherical @xmath36 coordinates reference and assuming to observe the radiation far enough from the metallic screen along the polar @xmath19 axis @xmath37 , the harmonic components of the transition field eq.([trans ] ) can be explicitly expressed via eq.([esplipse ] ) as @xmath38}\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{esplitrans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the vector @xmath39 indicates the coordinates over the target surface @xmath10 , while @xmath40 and @xmath41 indicate the transverse components of the wave - vectors corresponding to the _ pseudophotons _ and the transition radiation fields respectively .    as evident from the different role played in ( [ esplitrans ] ) by the fourier transform of the transverse distribution functions @xmath42 @xmath43 with respect to the longitudinal one @xmath44 , the three - dimensional generalization of eq.([coe ] ) by substituting the _ longitudinal form factor _ with a three - dimensional one such as in eq.([triff ] ) appears to be incorrect .",
    "it is also obvious to notice that eq.([esplitrans ] ) reduces to the well known _ single particle _",
    "transition radiation field @xcite when @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath47 .      in practical situations , as those occurring in an accelerator machine , the number of the electrons composing a bunch is so large that it can be reasonably described by means of a continuous probability distribution function ( _ continuous density limit _ ) .",
    "therefore , in order to derive the expression of the actually detected transition radiation spectrum , an average procedure has to be carried out : @xmath48 where in the second term of the previous statement the energy radiated - per solid angle and frequency units - by a particular discrete charge distribution is averaged over the ensemble of the infinite series of the equivalent discrete particle configurations @xcite .    supposing @xmath0 electrons moving with a common uniform velocity @xmath6 , the following expression @xmath49 is the fourier transform of the spatial discrete distribution @xmath50 a useful notation , distinguishing in the fourier transform of the charge distribution the contribution [ @xmath51 referred to electrons belonging to the same slice ( common @xmath19 coordinate ) @xmath52 allows also to outline that spatial coherent effects are expected to be observed in the spectrum , when the beam can be considered - with respect to the observed wave - length - as a discrete sequence of transverse continuous charge slices .",
    "in addition temporal coherent effects are expected to arise in the spectrum when the wave - length is so long that the slices sequence has to be considered as a continuous charge distribution also in the longitudinal direction .    as more extensively described in the appendix , the complete formal expression of the transition radiation spectrum - produced by a three - dimensional electron beam colliding normally with a metallic screen being at rest in",
    "the vacuum - can be expressed as @xmath53,\\label{finalespec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54}\\right|^2\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{fin - tot - spec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the hypothesis of the _ far field approximation _ and @xmath3 is the _ longitudinal form factor _ [ eq.([ff ] ) ] .    some comments about the last statements .",
    "( 1 ) when temporal coherent conditions are occurring , the transition radiation spectrum in the three - dimensional case shows the same dependence on the _ longitudinal form factor _ [ eq.([ff ] ) ] as in the one - dimensional case [ eq.([coe ] ) ] .",
    "( 2 ) the results stated by eqs.([finalespec ] , [ fin - tot - spec ] ) are consistent with the ones valid for one - dimensional charged beam when @xmath55 or when the observed wave - length is longer than the transverse size of the beam . ( 3 )",
    "conversely , when the observed wave - length is shorter than the transverse size of the beam , _ source size effects _ appear evident in the spectrum via a dependence on the fourier transforms of the transverse distribution of the beam @xmath56 . therefore ,",
    "both the measurements of the energy and of the transverse size of the beam are not independent each other when the spectrum shows spatial incoherent characteristics .",
    "in the ideal and handy case of a three - dimensional gaussian beam normally hitting a metallic screen @xmath10 of infinite size , the analytical expression for the transition radiation spectrum can be derived from eqs.([fin - tot - spec ] ) : @xmath57 ^ 2}.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{spec - inf - scr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to check that for a point - like charge ( @xmath58 eq.([spec - inf - scr ] ) reduces to the well known frequency independent _ single particle spectrum _",
    "@xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and the polar angle @xmath61 is referred to the @xmath19 axis picked to be normal to the target surface .",
    "while for a three - dimensional bunch , having a gaussian transverse distribution @xmath62 , the eq.([spec - inf - scr ] ) can be written as @xmath63 which , integrated over @xmath64 with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath65 , reduces to @xmath66,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{inf - scr - tras - asym}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the bessel function of the first kind @xcite . in fig.1 the angular distribution [ eq.([inf - scr - tras - asym ] ) ] corresponding to a cylindrical symmetric gaussian beam @xmath69 is compared with the _ single particle spectrum _ [ eq.([spec - inf - scr - esp ] ) ] for different values of the beam energy @xmath70 and of the @xmath71 parameter , where @xmath72 is the observed wave - length .",
    "the shift of the polar angle distribution of the transition radiation intensity - shown in fig.1 - is also meaningful and instructive of the circumstance that beam energy measurements , based on the analysis of the angular distribution of the spectrum , can be - depending on the observed wave - length - strongly affected by the beam transverse size at the low energy regime .",
    "in fact , according to the _ single particle _",
    "theory , the angular position @xmath73 of the intensity peak is typically considered as a rough estimate of the beam energy @xmath74 .    finally - with regard to eq.([inf - scr - tras - asym ] )",
    "- the complete expression for the transition radiation spectrum corresponding to a three dimensional gaussian beam passing through an infinite metallic screen is @xmath75% \\frac{d^2i^s}{d\\theta d\\omega}\\label{inf - scr - tot}\\ ] ] with @xmath76 .",
    "from eqs.([spec - inf - scr ] , [ inf - scr - tras ] ) it can be observed that the spectral angular distribution carries information about the transverse beam size .",
    "then , as far as the arguments treated in this paper can be considered valid , the analysis of the angular distribution of the transition radiation intensity offers information not only about the beam energy , but also about the beam size .",
    "from such a circumstance several consequences concerning beam diagnostics applications of the transition radiation and deeper understanding of its phenomelogy can be drawn .",
    "first of all the beam energy measurement based on the usual _ single particle _ analysis of the angular distribution of the transition radiation in the optical region can be affected by a systematic error as larger as longer is the transverse beam size with respect to the observed wave - length .",
    "moreover , such a dependence of the spectrum on the fourier transform of the transverse charge distribution offers interesting and suggestive opportunities in the field of the beam diagnostic applications of the transition radiation .",
    "in fact , although the technique to measure the transverse size of the beam by analyzing the angular distribution of the intensity offers a poor appealing as beam diagnostic tool in the optical region ( otr , @xcite ) , nevertheless it appears to be promising in the infrared - micrometer analysis @xcite of those transition radiation spectra produced by intense and high energy charged beams passing through a hole in a metallic screen , which are properly referred as diffraction radiation phenomena @xcite .",
    "related to the understanding of the phenomelogy , it is to be noticed that , according to eq.([spec - inf - scr ] ) , the spectral angular distribution decreases to zero when the frequency tends to infinity , and that such a behaviour is in agreement with the high frequency features of the experimentally observed transition radiation spectra @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is to be stressed that such agreement - in this context necessarily qualitative - with the experimental results does not follow from any assumption on the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant of the metallic screen .",
    "conversely it is well known that , in order to explain such a feature in the measured transition radiation spectra , it is necessary to dismiss in the high frequency regime the hypothesis of considering ideal conductor properties for the metallic screen ( dielectric constant @xmath21 ) and to take into account the real dielectric properties @xmath77 when the frequency is higher than the plasma frequency @xmath78 @xcite , according to : @xmath79 furthermore , other and more qualified confirmations to the present approach to the transition radiation theory for real electron beams follow from a comparison with some other well - known features of the experimental spectra .",
    "in fact , it is possible to derive the analytical expression for the total energy emitted during the radiative mechanism by integrating eq.([inf - scr - tras - asym ] ) with respect to the polar angle @xmath61 and the wave - number @xmath80 .",
    "for such a purpose the transverse size of the beam is assumed so large that the _ ideal conductor hypothesis _",
    "@xmath81 can be considered valid in that part of the frequency band effectively of interest in the integration . moreover , assuming for simplicity a gaussian cylindrical symmetry @xmath82 for an electron beam with energy @xmath83 , the total - `` forward '' and `` backward '' - energy emitted during the collision can be expressed as : @xmath84 in the range of validity of the just referred hypothesis and without introducing any frequency cut - off , the analytical formula expressed by eq.([tot - energy ] ) allows a plain explanation of the experimental main features observed in the emitted transition radiation energy in both the low and the high beam energy limits .",
    "the previous statement is a particular case of the most general expression valid for an asymmetric gaussian distribution @xmath85 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "as comment to the last result , it should be noticed that , approaching the beam axis over the boundary surface , the _ pseudophotons _ field [ eq.([esplipse ] ) ] diverges to infinity in the case of a single particle , while it maintains a finite value in the case of a three - dimensional charge distribution , as expected for the electric field inside the core of a spatially extended charge distribution .",
    "in fact , using spherical coordinates and referring the polar angle @xmath61 to the @xmath19 axis normal to the target surface lying on the @xmath9 plane , it can be demonstrated that , for a gaussian beam with a cylindrical symmetry , the _ pseudophotons _ electric field [ eq.([esplipse ] ) ] over the boundary surface is @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it can be easily verified that for a point - like charge @xmath91 the field eq.([radial - elec ] ) diverges to infinity @xmath92 as @xmath93 , while in the case of a transverse gaussian beam [ eq.([radial - elec ] ) ] continues to maintain a finite and bounded value @xmath94 .",
    "in the framework of the _ pseudophotons method _ and under the hypothesis of the _ far field approximation _ it has been demonstrated that , in the case of a three - dimensional charged beam colliding with a metallic target , the temporal coherent part of the spectrum depends on the _ longitudinal form factor _ in the same manner as in the one - dimensional case .",
    "it has been also demonstrated that the transverse beam size affects the spectrum via the fourier transform of the transverse charge distribution and that the spectrum becomes insensitive to it - reducing to the well known _ single particle spectrum _ - when the observed wave - length is larger than the transverse beam size . as reasonable to expect ,",
    "the _ single particle spectrum _ can be interpreted as the spatial coherent limit of the transition radiation spectrum corresponding to a three - dimensional beam .",
    "the demonstrated evidence in the spectrum of the spatial incoherent effects due to the transverse size of the beam - on the one hand - allows a better comprehension of some aspects of the transition radiation phenomenology - on the other hand - offers new perspectives in the use of the transition radiation as beam diagnostic tool .",
    "in fact , as the transverse size of the beam is increasing , the high frequency damping feature observed in the experimental transition radiation spectra should depend more on the _ source size _ effects than on the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant of the metallic screen . moreover , supposing as dominant such a mechanism , it is also possible to derive an analytical formula for the total radiated energy showing an unexpected dependence on the reciprocal of the transverse beam size besides the expected one on both the square of the charge velocity and energy .    from the point of view of the beam diagnostic implications , the dependence on _ transverse form factor _ appears to be an useful tool to derive information about the transverse beam size from the analysis of the spectral angular distribution , even observing the radiation in conditions of temporal incoherence and in non - optical wave - length regions , when the radiative mechanism is produced in a non - destructive way by a charged beam passing through a slit in a metallic target ( diffraction radiation ) .",
    "in fact from eqs.([inf - scr - tras - asym ] ) , supposing as known the beam energy , it appears in principle possible to measure the beam size by observing the radiation in conditions of spatial incoherence , i.e. , by selecting - by means of a monochromator - from the spectrum a wave - length much shorter than the transverse size itself and by analyzing the corresponding angular distribution .",
