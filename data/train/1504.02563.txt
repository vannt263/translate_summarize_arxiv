    "many intermediate - age star clusters , e.g. , ngc1651 , show complicated color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , which include blue stragglers , a broad main sequence , an extended main sequence turn - off ( emsto ) and an extended red clump(erc ) . such clusters are found mainly in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite , * ? ? ?",
    "* and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) @xcite . there has been a long history of the explanation of such special cmds .",
    "factors considered as possible causes for cmds with emsto and erc features include spread of chemical abundance @xcite , * * ? ? ?",
    "* * capture of field stars @xcite , merger of existing star clusters @xcite , formation of a second generation of stars from the ejecta of first generation asymptotic giant branch stars @xcite , binary stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , observational selection and uncertainty effects @xcite , mixture of stars with and without overshooting @xcite , differential reddening @xcite , age spread @xcite , stellar rotation @xcite , and combination of binaries and rotation @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , some other studies , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , pointed out some challenges to these assumptions .",
    "finally , a spreading in age ( e.g. , @xcite ) and stellar rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ) are thought to be the most probable causes for special cmds with emsto and erc , because only such models can reproduce the emsto part sufficiently well .",
    "some special cmds of clusters have been compared with theoretical models , but no work compares the results from a few different stellar population models simultaneously .",
    "such an approach can , however , give new insight into the relative importance of various factors involved in the observed cmd .",
    "this work aims to supply such an attempt via a typical cluster , ngc1651 .",
    "this is a red globular cluster in the lmc , which is situated 3 kpc southwest of the bar in a region that appears fairly free of recent star formation .",
    "the cmd of ngc1651 has been studied before , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "although not very clear , special cmd structures with emsto and erc , which have first been described by @xcite and @xcite , can be seen in the results of @xcite .",
    "the special cmd of ngc1651 was recently confirmed by the present authors using data from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) archive , in which blue stragglers , broad ms , emsto and erc structures seem very clear .",
    "we intend to study this cmd via various model assumptions .",
    "the study will help to clarify the roles of various factors in the explanation of observed cmds and in the determination of cluster parameters . in the most complex model , the effects of binaries , age spread , rotating stars , and star formation history",
    "are taken into account , besides those of distance , extinction , and metallicity .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : sections 2 and 3 introduce the observed and theoretical cmds ; section 4 introduces the technique of cmd fitting ; section 5 presents the best - fit results from different models ; and finally , section 6 contains a summary and discussion .",
    "the data of ngc1651 are obtained from the hst archive , and consist of total exposures of 500 seconds in the f555w and f814w filters of wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) . in order to guarantee the data quality",
    ", we handle the data using a stellar photometry package ( hstphot , @xcite ) specially designed for use with hst wfpc2 images .",
    "the magnitudes are automatically transformed to standard @xmath0 magnitudes by hstphot .",
    "we are shown that stars brighter than 19.0mag are not measured with the long exposures .",
    "although the stars distribute in wide color and magnitude ranges , only those near the turn - off are taken to serve the purpose of this paper .",
    "we finally obtain a cmd that consists of 4244 stars with @xmath1 magnitude between 18.5 and 25.5mag , and @xmath2 color between 0 and 1.8mag . the number of stars is larger than previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the cmd seems clear , which is helpful for our detailed study .",
    "the cmd part fainter than 25.5mag is not used because of its high incompleteness ( @xmath3 40 % ) .",
    "a kind of photometric uncertainty has been reported by hstphot , but it is obviously less than the real error because simulated cmds are much narrower than the observed one when the error reported by hstphot is taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the sample seems incomplete , because the stars of ngc1651 are in a crowded field .",
    "this will surely lead to some extra errors .",
    "we therefore perform artificial star tests ( asts ) to characterize the photometric errors and completeness of stars . via this technique ,",
    "most uncertainties caused by crowding and the photometry process can be estimated .",
    "the asts are performed as follows .",
    "first , a large number of images that include more than 10@xmath4 artificial stars in the same color and magnitude ranges as the observed ones are generated . for convenience , the real magnitudes of artificial stars are recorded as input magnitudes",
    ". then the generated images are processed by hstphot to find out stars and measure their magnitudes .",
    "the measured magnitudes are recorded as recovered magnitudes . finally , the input and recovered magnitudes of artificial stars are compared , to characterize the photometric errors , and the input and recovered star numbers are compared , to give star completeness .",
    "1 shows the photometric errors as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath5 input magnitudes , and fig .",
    "2 shows the completeness of different cmd parts of ngc1651 .",
    "we see that photometric errors mainly depend on recovered magnitudes .",
    "the fainter the magnitudes , the larger the spread of photometric errors .",
    "in addition , we find that the completeness of various cmd parts are different .",
    "fainter areas have lower completeness on average .",
    "thus we applied position - dependent completeness to the observed cmd .",
    "note that the results for where observed stars are located are highlighted in fig .",
    "2 , in order to help readers understand the observed cmd better . fig .",
    "3 shows some compensating stars that are randomly added into the observed cmd according to star completeness .",
    "because added stars are far fewer than the observed stars , they do not affect the final results too much .",
    "the final observed cmd of ngc1651 , which has included compensating stars , is shown by fig .",
    "this cmd consists of 4803 stars and is much clearer than what is used by previous works @xcite .",
    "we can see broad ms , emsto and erc ( see sect . 5 for details )",
    "structures clearly from this cmd .",
    "it is therefore a good example for our detailed study .",
    "we construct synthetic cmds following previously cited works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "simple and composite stellar populations ( ssps and csps ) are built by taking the initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and 100 , respectively .",
    "we build both single star stellar populations ( sssps ) and binary star stellar populations ( bssps ) .",
    "the difference between the two kinds of populations is that bssps contain some binaries but sssps do not . in each binary ,",
    "the mass of the primary component is generated following the selected imf , and the mass of the secondary component is calculated by taking a random secondary - to - primary mass ratio ( @xmath6 ) , which obeys a uniform distribution within 01 .",
    "the eccentricity ( @xmath7 ) of each binary is given randomly within 0 - 1 .",
    "the separations ( @xmath8 ) of two components are given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this leads to about 50 per cent stars in binaries with orbital periods less than 100 yr . although the typical binary fraction of lmc clusters is about 35 per cent @xcite , the values for various clusters may be different .",
    "thus some population models with different binary fractions are built in this work .",
    "we remove some random binaries to make the binary fraction equal to what we need .    after the generation of the star sample , we calculate the evolution of stars using the rapid stellar evolution code of @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter hurley code ) , which can evolve both single stars and binaries . in binary evolution , most binary interactions such as mass transfer , mass accretion , common - envelope evolution , collisions , supernova kicks , angular momentum loss mechanism , and tidal interactions are taken into account .",
    "the typical uncertainty of this code is about 5 per cent in stellar luminosity , radius and core mass , which affects the results slightly .    because hurley code does not take stellar rotation into account",
    ", we add the effect of rotation on effective temperature , luminosity and ms lifetime to massive ( @xmath3 1.7 ) stars , using a recent result of evolution of rotating stars @xcite .",
    "the database of @xcite is particularly useful for constructing synthetic populations of stars , accounting for mass , rotation , and metallicity distributions .",
    "it includes an accurate computation of the angular - momentum and stellar - wind anisotropy .",
    "the changes of surface temperature and luminosity , which are caused by stellar rotation , are calculated by comparing the evolutionary tracks of rotating stars to those of non - rotating ones .",
    "the changes can be described as a function of stellar metallicity , mass , and initial rotation rate . besides changing the evolutionary track , rotation",
    "significantly affects the ms lifetime of stars .",
    "because of centrifugal forces , rotating stars behave like non - rotating stars of lower mass ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore calculate the ms lifetime change of rotating stars using the result of @xcite .",
    "stars with rotation rate ( the ratio of the actual angular velocity to the critical one , @xmath14 , see @xcite ) larger than 0.3 usually have a lifetime change greater than 15% , and the most rapid rotators may reach values of 30  35% . because of the lack of evolutionary tracks of stars with @xmath15=0.008 , stellar metallicity is interpolated to the typical value of lmc clusters to fit the needs of this work .",
    "in addition , some random values are assigned to the stars of a population following the observed results of @xcite ( similarly , @xcite ) , because the rotation rate of stars has obvious distributions .",
    "finally , the stellar evolutionary parameters ( [ fe / h ] , t@xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) are transformed into colors and magnitudes using the atmosphere library of @xcite .",
    "the photometric errors derived from asts are applied to the simulated stars when comparing the synthetic cmds with the observed one .",
    "in this work we want to determine the distance modulus , color excess , binary fraction , rotational star fraction , and star formation mode of clusters . in order to determine these effectively , we apply a new cmd fitting method . the new technique searches for best - fit parameters by comparing the star fraction in every part ( or grid ) of a cmd .",
    "an observed cmd is divided into many grids via selected color and magnitude intervals .",
    "the goodness of fit is judged by the average difference of grids that contain observed or theoretical stars ( hereafter effective grids ) , when taking the weight of each grid into account . for convenience",
    ", we defined a parameter , weighted average difference ( @xmath19 ) , to denote the goodness of fit .",
    "it can be calculated by @xmath20}{\\sum\\omega_i}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the weight of @xmath22th grid , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are star fractions of observed and theoretical cmds in the same grid .",
    "@xmath21 is calculated as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the completeness of @xmath22th grid that is given by ast , and @xmath27 means star fraction uncertainty .",
    "although various indicators are used for the goodness of cmd fitting by different works , there are obvious advantages to take @xmath19 in this work , which counts stars but is different from the approach used by @xcite .",
    "firstly , @xmath19 can give us a rough estimation of the difference between observed and synthetic cmds .",
    "in other words , we believe that @xmath19 has more physical meaning than others , such as the widely used @xmath28 , which is suitable for gaussian observational error distributions , and poisson equivalent @xmath28 ( hereafter @xmath29 ) , which is suitable for poisson error distributions @xcite .",
    "secondly , @xmath19 has considered most information about the observed cmd , including distributions of magnitude errors , completeness of stars , and star fraction difference of observed and theoretical cmds .",
    "thirdly , unlike the @xmath29 method of @xcite , which requires there to be observed star in very grid ( in the calculation of @xmath29 , i.e. , equation 5 in @xcite , @xmath30 is meaningless when @xmath23 = 0 ) , our method , allows grids to have an absence of observed stars when calculating the goodness indicator . in order to help readers to understand the relation between @xmath19 and other indicators , fig .",
    "5 compares @xmath19 with two other indicators ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "note that the data are taken from the cmd fitting of ngc1651 using a few different models .",
    "we see that @xmath19 increases with @xmath28 as a whole , which suggests that they may give similar results",
    ". however , @xmath19 and @xmath29 will possibly give different results , because there is no correlation between them .",
    "note that @xmath28 is calculated by @xmath31 and @xmath29 by @xmath32.\\ ] ]    when we test the above three kinds of fitting methods using a few artificial clusters ( @xmath15 = 0.008 ; age = 0.9 , 1.2 , 1.5 , 1.8 , 2.1gyrs ; @xmath33 = 0.0 , 0.3 , 0.6 ) , it is shown that @xmath19 and @xmath28 methods usually give correct results , but @xmath29 method does not report correct results for some cases .",
    "in particular , @xmath19 fitting can determine the stellar ages of artificial clusters accurately , although there is an uncertainty of about 0.1 in @xmath33 .",
    "when we apply @xmath19 fitting to two simple clusters ( ngc1261 and ngc2257 ) , which do not have an emsto structure , the best - fit models agree well with observed cmds as a whole ( fig . 8) .",
    "we see that a few stars , in particular those on the horizontal branch ( hb ) , are not fitted well .",
    "this may result from the still large uncertainties in the late phases of stellar evolution . in deed ,",
    "hbs are very tricky to model , because of mass loss .",
    "the test therefore suggests that the @xmath19 method is reliable for cmd studies .",
    "note that the data of two clusters are also taken from hst , and one can check their magnitude versus error relations via figs .",
    "in fact , magnitude errors affect the shapes of cmds visibly .",
    "in this section we use eight kinds of stellar population models to study the observed cmd of ngc1651 and compare the results .",
    "these models are different from each other by binary fraction , fraction of rotational stars , star formation types ( single or multiple bursts ) , and star formation histories .",
    "the eight types of models and their abbreviations are listed in table 1 .",
    "they are used to derive the best - fit model based on @xmath19 fitting .",
    "note that the observed cmd possibly contains a few field stars , e.g. , those below the red giant branch , but they did not affect the best - fit result as they enlarge the @xmath19 values of all models simultaneously .",
    ".model numbers ( no . ) and abbreviations of eight types of stellar population models .",
    "fractions of binaries and rotational stars can be set to any value . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work , we used eight kinds of stellar population models to fit the special cmd of lmc cluster ngc1651 .",
    "our results suggest that stellar binarity , rotation , and age spread can demonstrably improve the goodness of cmd fit , but there is a degeneracy among their effects .",
    "it is therefore difficult to judge the stellar population feature ( e.g. , age and star formation history ) of this cluster using traditional stellar population ( tsp ) models such as non - rotational single star simple stellar population ( ssssp ) and single star composite stellar population ( sscsp ) models . for future studies we strongly suggest using those advanced stellar population ( asp ) models which take into account stellar binarity , rotation , and star formation history .",
    "the result of this study shows that cluster ngc1651 is of true distance modulus between 18.68 and 18.70mag , @xmath34 around 0.19mag , and binary fraction around 50 per cent .",
    "we can conclude that both bsssp and bscsp models can reproduce the main shape of cmd of ngc1651 , if the effect of stellar rotation is taken into account . a bscsp model with half binaries and 70 per cent rotational stars",
    "can fit the observed cmd best among all the test models .",
    "the star formation history types ( one or a few star formations ) , stellar ages and star formation histories ( or modes ) from different kinds of models are significantly different .",
    "although our result prefers that ngc1651 is a bscsp with rotational stars , it can not exclude the bscsp model without rotators or bsssp model that consists of rotational stars .",
    "further study ( e.g. , spectral study ) is therefore needed to confirm the results .",
    "for instance , we can check how many and how fast the massive stars of a cluster are really rotating from the stellar spectra to judge the role of stellar rotation . note that tsp models such as single star stellar population ( sssp ) models , seem significantly worse than binary star stellar populations ( bssps ) .",
    "thus ngc1651 certainly contain some binaries , and we need only to check how many rotators are included in a cluster like ngc1651 .    in this work ,",
    "we use the calculation of @xcite to estimate the effects of stellar rotation .",
    "although the value is not accurate enough , the treatment is reasonable .",
    "first , in the work of @xcite , the variation in the angular momentum content is precisely tracked as it changes under the influence of stellar winds and mechanical mass loss .",
    "the effects of initial rotation on the hertzsprung - russell diagram , the evolution of surface rotation and abundances , and main sequence lifetime are computed simultaneously in this paper .",
    "this makes their results more reliable than some other work ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , the observed cmd of ngc1651 is well reproduced when we adding the result of @xcite into our binary star stellar population models .",
    "another important reason is that different works show the trend of cmd change is correct when taking stellar rotation into account ( @xcite ) , although the observational work by @xcite and theoretical work by @xcite showed that rotation works in the opposite sense in a star cluster .",
    "when we use the fitting formulae of @xcite to calculate rotational effects , we also get the same conclusion .",
    "third , as pointed out above , the effects of fraction of rotational stars , distribution of rotation rate and fraction of binaries are degenerated in some cases .",
    "finally , although only the effects of massive rotational stars have been taken into account by rotational population models because of the lack of evolutionary data of low - mass rotators , the treatment does not affect the final result too much , as low - mass stars usually rotate much more slowly than massive ones .",
    "therefore , the treatment for the rotational effects of stars is reasonable at this moment , and the main conclusion is accordingly reliable .    furthermore , although @xcite argue that a spread of rotation rate can not lead to emsto , because rotation affects the lifetime of stars , our work implies that the conclusion may strongly depend on stellar evolutionary models .",
    "it shows that when taking the new result of @xcite for rotational effects , the ms lifetime change not only reproduces our previous result from fitting formulae @xcite , but also make the fit of std - rot bscsp to erc better .",
    "compared to our previous work , the treatment in this work can reproduce the observed cmd better , because most rotational stars leave ms later than non - rotating ones .",
    "this changes the positions of components of binaries in a cmd when they leave ms and reach rc . because the evolutionary track and ms lifetime of a rotating binary depend on the masses , separation , and rotation rates of its component stars",
    ", rotation can not lead to the same cmd position ( see @xcite for comparison ) for a given age .",
    "the special cmd structure of a rotating - star population results from both the changes of evolutionary tracks and ms lifetime .",
    "thereby , ms lifetime change also contribute to the final cmd , and rotation plays different roles in populations with and without binaries .",
    "this is different from @xcite , which claims that the increase in ms lifetime does not compensate for the changes in the evolutionary tracks .    finally ,",
    "although ast technique was used for estimating the uncertainties in magnitudes of ngc1651 , more uncertainties exist and may affect the results . in fact , certain other factors , including uncertainties in metallicity , initial mass function , binary assumptions , calculation of stellar evolution , atmosphere library , and contamination of field stars , can also affect the cmds of stellar populations . because the study of these uncertainties is not the purpose of this work , we did not test their effects .",
    "however , further detailed studies on these uncertainties will be very helpful .",
    "one can read many examples of this kind of detailed study , such as @xcite .",
