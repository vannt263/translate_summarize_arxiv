    "when a linearly polarized plane wave is focused by a diffraction - limited lens , the intensity distribution in the focal plane is in the scalar theory the well - known airy pattern .",
    "however , when the lens has high numerical aperture , the rotation of polarization must be accounted for and the vector diffraction theory of ignatowsky @xcite , @xcite and richards and wolf @xcite , @xcite has to be applied to obtain the field distribution in the focal region .",
    "we then get three electric and three magnetic field components in the focal region . when the beam in the lens aperture is uniformly linearly polarized plane wave , the dominant electric field component in the focal region is found to be parallel to the polarization direction of the incident plane wave .",
    "but , as the numerical aperture increases , the maximum value of the longitudinal component of the electric field in the focal plane becomes quite substantial , although it vanishes at the focal point itself .",
    "an appropriately shaped focused spot is essential in many applications such as optical recording , photolithography and microscopy .",
    "furthermore , a field in focus with maximum electric component in a specific direction is important for manipulating single molecules and particles , and in materials processing @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the focused wavefront can be tailored by setting a proper amplitude , phase and polarization distributions in the pupil of the focusing lens .",
    "nowadays it is possible to realize almost any complex transmission function in the pupil plane , using for example liquid crystal - based devices @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the optimization of focused fields has been studied by other authors .    in this paper",
    ", we maximize a specified component of the electric field in the focal point of a diffraction limited lens .",
    "first we consider fields in free space or in homogeneous matter , without taking into account the way these fields are realized , in particular without considering the lens .",
    "we merely suppose that , with respect to a cartesian coordinate system @xmath0 , the fields considered consist of plane waves propagating in the positive @xmath1-direction and have wave vectors with angles with the positive @xmath1-axis that do not exceed a specific maximum angle , i.e. , the numerical aperture of the plane waves is restricted .",
    "the optimization problem is then to find the complex plane wave amplitudes such that , for a given direction in space and for given mean flow of electromagnetic power through a plane @xmath1=constant , the amplitude at some point ( chosen at the origin ) of the electric field component that is parallel to the chosen direction is larger than that of any other field for the same numerical aperture and the same mean total power flow .",
    "we shall derive closed formulas for the plane wave amplitudes of the optimum field .",
    "the solutions of the optimization problems for the field propagating in homogeneous space is rigorous results since they are derived from maxwell s equations without any further assumptions .",
    "next we will consider the realization of the optimum field using a diffraction limited lens with the origin as focal point . by using the vector diffraction theory of ignatowksy and richards and wolf , closed expressions for the optimum pupil distributions",
    "will be derived , which after focussing give the optimum field component in the focal point of the lens .",
    "in contrast with the solution in terms of the plane wave expansion , the formulas for the optimum pupil fields are approximate since they are based on the vector diffraction theory which is an approximate theory that is valid for lenses of which the focal distance and the pupil radius are many wavelengths .    when one considers the focussing by a lens it is obvious that the plane wave expansion in image space has finite numerical aperture of that of the lens : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the refractive index in image space and @xmath4 is half the top angle of the cone with top the focal point and base the pupil .",
    "but also when one would consider only waves in free space without a focussing lens , there is a good reason to restrict the fields to finite numerical aperture , in that case in particular to @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath6 a part of the evanescent waves are taken into account in the expansion .",
    "one can then construct fields with a given power which have arbitrary large components .",
    "the evanescent waves do not contribute to the total power and hence one can increase their amplitudes by any desired amount to achieve arbitrarily high local fields",
    ". stated differently , by constructing suitable time - harmonic source distributions that emit singular fields with finite power flow , one can achieve arbitrary large field components by approaching these source distributions . at small distances to the sources the evanescent waves play of course a major role .    among the directions for the optimized electric field component , two are of particular interest , namely the directions parallel and perpendicular to the optical @xmath1-axis .",
    "these directions are also called the longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "the field with maximum longitudinal component has been discussed in @xcite , but without derivation . in this",
    "paper details of the derivation are provided and the optimization problem is generalized to arbitrary directions of the electric field vector .    as was announced in @xcite , the pupil field that when focused gives maximum longitudinal component , is radially polarized .",
    "this means that in all points of the lens pupil , the electric field is linearly polarized with the electric field pointing in the radial direction .",
    "furthermore , the electric fields in all points of the pupil are in phase and the electric field amplitudes are rotationally symmetric .",
    "the amplitude of the electric pupil field vanishes at the center of the pupil and is a monotonically increasing function of the radial coordinate .",
    "the shape of this function depends on the numerical aperture .",
    "it was noted by several authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that when a radially polarized beam is focused , the distribution of the longitudinal component can be considerably narrower than the focussed spot obtained by focusing a linearly polarized plane wave . with the development of a new generation of photoresists @xcite , it is possible to control the photosensitive material in such a way that it will react to only one of the polarization components of the electric field .",
    "materials with molecules having fixed absorption dipole moments have been applied in @xcite to be able to probe field components individually .",
    "when this component is the longitudinal component , a tighter spot can thus be obtained than with the classical airy pattern .",
    "often the amplitude distribution of the radially polarized beam in the pupil plane is chosen to be a doughnut shape or a ring mask function @xcite .",
    "but these distributions do not give the maximum possible longitudinal electric field component in focus for given power and its amplitude as a function of the radial pupil coordinate differs from the optimum function derived in the present paper .",
    "the other case of particular interest is the optimization of the transverse electric field vector .",
    "since the optical system is assumed to be rotationally symmetric around the optical axis , we may choose this direction parallel to the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the solution of the optimization problem is then the field for which the amplitude of the @xmath7-component of the electric field in the focal point is maximum for the given numerical aperture and the given total power flow .",
    "we will show that the corresponding pupil field is linearly polarized with direction of polarization predominantly , although not exactly , parallel to the @xmath7-axis .",
    "therefore , the focused optimum field is similar to the vectorial airy pattern of a focused linearly polarized plane wave , although it is _ not _ identical to it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will formulate the optimization problem and we will prove that the optimization problem has one and only one solution . in section 3 , we will apply the lagrange multiplier rule to obtain closed formulas for the plane wave amplitudes of the optimum field and for the optimum field distributions near focus . in section 4 , we will study the optimum fields in the focal region , in particular their mean energy flow . then , in section 5 , we apply the vector diffraction theory of ignatowsky , richards and wolf to derive the electric field distribution in the pupil of the lens that , when focussed , yields the maximum field component in the focal region .",
    "we begin with some notations . consider a time - harmonic electromagnetic field in a homogeneous unbounded medium with real refractive index @xmath3 (",
    "i.e. , the material does not absorb electromagnetic radiation of the given frequency ) : @xmath8 , \\label{eq.cale}\\\\ { \\mbox{\\boldmath${\\cal h}$}}(\\mathbf{r},t ) & = & \\mbox{re}\\left [ \\mathbf{h}(\\mathbf{r } ) e^{-i \\omega t}\\right ] , \\label{eq.calh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 . as stated in the introduction ,",
    "the lens is first not considered in the optimization problem .",
    "it is merely assumed that , with respect to the cartesian coordinate system @xmath0 with unit vectors @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the electromagnetic field ( [ eq.cale ] ) , ( [ eq.calh ] ) has numerical aperture @xmath13 and that the plane wave vectors have positive @xmath1-component : @xmath14 where @xmath15 with @xmath16 with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the wavelength in vacuum , and where @xmath19 with @xmath4 the maximum angle that the wave vectors make with the positive @xmath1-direction . if @xmath5 we have @xmath20 and the plane wave spectrum then consists of all homogeneous plane waves that propagate in the non - negative @xmath1-direction ( there are no evanescent waves in the expansion ) . when @xmath21 , the cone of allowed wave vectors has top angle @xmath22 .",
    "because the electric field is free of divergence we have that @xmath23 we shall use spherical coordinates in reciprocal @xmath24-space : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the polar and azimuthal angles , respectively .",
    "conversely , we have @xmath28 note that @xmath29 is a positively oriented orthonormal basis : @xmath30 furthermore , @xmath31 and the jacobian of the transformation @xmath32 is : @xmath33 so that @xmath34 because of ( [ eq.div0 ] ) we have : @xmath35 for some functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "then , using ( [ eq.vecprbasis ] ) : @xmath38 the plane wave expansion can thus be written as @xmath39 the @xmath40-component is parallel to the plane through the wave vector and the @xmath1-axis , whereas the @xmath41-component is perpendicular to this plane .",
    "let @xmath42 be a real unit vector .",
    "we consider the projection of the electric field at the origin at time @xmath43 on the direction of @xmath44 : @xmath45 \\ , \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\alpha \\ ,        d\\alpha\\ , d\\beta ,      \\label{eq.ez0}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 we will consider @xmath47 as a ( linear ) functional of @xmath48 , which for brevity we will denote by @xmath49",
