    "<S> these effects are well - known from calculations of the free nn @xmath5 matrix @xcite and in brueckner theory , e.g. @xcite . in order to avoid these uncertainties one has to introduce vertex and nucleon form factors which regularize the large momentum region . </S>",

    "<S> 2 . the ddm3y1-paris effective @xmath1-interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi density distribution @xcite and the mtf approximation for @xmath10 have been used in this respect . moreover , the corresponding volume integrals @xmath70 and @xmath71 radii @xmath72 are given in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the real part of the jlm potential has been chosen for the present analysis since the parameters of the ddm3y1 interaction @xcite was obtained by fitting of the jlm results for the nucleon scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the well - known omp parameter set of lagrange - lejeune @xcite has also been computed for both kinds of projectiles on @xmath64nb , close to the jlm analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> first , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows that more diffuse potentials with larger @xmath72 values are obtained for neutrons as well as for protons when the folding procedure increases in accuracy going from nm to df cases . actually , the comparison in figs . 2 ( a),(b ) and ( d),(e ) of the real omp obtained by using the nm and sf methods evidences the effects of the target nuclear density and the corresponding average relative momentum . </S>",
    "<S> next , the comparison with figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) and ( f ) shows even stronger effect of the nucleon density distribution and the average relative momentum . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the different choices of the target @xmath47 ( mtf or etf ) have practically no effect on the single - folded real omp , the corresponding curves in figs . 2(b ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) being overlapped .    </S>",
    "<S> second , the comparison between the real parts of the omps shown in fig . 2 to the phenomenological values @xcite and the jlm parametrization @xcite is completed by considering the energy dependence of the corresponding volume integrals . from fig.3 </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the phenomenological and both calculated @xmath70 values from the sf and the df approach agree rather well . in view of the increasing agreement for the depths ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) and the @xmath72 values ( table i ) in going from the sf to df procedures these comparisons can be considered an important test of the present calculations . </S>",
    "<S> a comment concerning the proton case is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> there , the comparison to the jlm parametrization is less significant , because the latter accounts only for the isoscalar component of the full real omp .    </S>",
    "<S> third , we have considered in the present work three different density - dependent versions ddm3y1 , bdm3y1 and hlm3y of the m3y - paris and m3y - reid @xmath1-interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the double - folded real omps corresponding to the former interaction for ddm3y1 and bdm3y1 are shown in fig . 4 for the neutron as well as the proton cases . </S>",
    "<S> it results that the two density dependences lead to almost identical folded real omps provided that a fermi - distribution of the nucleon density is used . also , the calculated real part of the omp using hlm3y interaction @xcite lead to comparable results with those obtained by ddm3y1 and bdm3y1 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial dependence of the real omp corresponding to the paris - hlm3y effective @xmath1-interaction , however evidences enhanced values in the surface region as can be seen from the @xmath71 radii values in table 1 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , an obvious difference exists between the df real potentials corresponding to the simple m3y - interaction and the density - dependent versions , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the density dependence of the effective @xmath1-interaction improves the agreement of the folded potentials with the phenomenological ones by reducing the df potential values at small values of @xmath68 where the highest overlap of the interacting projectile and target - nucleus densities takes place . </S>",
    "<S> however , the simple m3y folded potentials are less diffuse in the nuclear surface region , e.g. they have smaller @xmath72 values than the real omps obtained by means of the energy - dependent @xmath1-interactions ( see table 1 ) .    the importance of the realistic effective @xmath1-interactions is pointed out by showing also in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 the df real potentials calculated by means of the usual 1 fm range yukawa interaction with the @xmath8 strength values obtained by watanabe _ et al . _ for these systems @xcite , i.e. , @xmath8=40 mev for @xmath73+@xmath74 and 46.8 mev for @xmath75+@xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , there are also shown the results obtained by using the @xmath76 1 fm range yukawa interaction with @xmath8 strengths corresponding to the volume integral values provided by the paris - m3y interaction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the improvement in comparison with the 1 fm range yukawa interaction obtained just using the simpler m3y interaction is obvious . </S>",
    "<S> rather similar effect has the use of the @xmath76 @xmath8 values , corresponding to the paris - m3y volume integrals </S>",
    "<S> . obviously , the supplementary density dependence increases the agreement with the phenomenological optical potentials [ see figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c)(f ) ] considerably .    finally , one comment may concern the effect of the @xmath1-interaction type , i.e. of the paris and reid potentials . as seen from table 1 , the @xmath70 and @xmath72 values for the corresponding neutron and proton folded potentials are close to each other , independent of using the nm , sf , and df . thus one may conclude that both @xmath1 interactions lead to reliable results in folding calculations .    in conclusion , this analysis has shown that the double folding procedure involving the nucleon - density fermi distribution and average relative momentum leads to real omps at lower energies in good agreement with the phenomenological omps as well as with the jlm parametrization for both neutron- and proton - nucleus scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the average effective @xmath1-interaction strength by using the actual folded real omp and following @xcite is in progress . since this quantity is still considered as the only free parameter of the quantum - statistical studies of the multistep reactions , the corresponding search for the realistic effective @xmath1-interaction at low energies is thus of further interest .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the full folding calculations to the results obtained with the strongly simplified single yukawa description is very instructive showing clearly the restrictions of a `` simple '' parameterization . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , the depth of the potential is overestimated because of the lack of density dependence , as one should expect . for inelastic transitions at a fixed incident energy one might compensate that shortcoming by simply rescaling the v@xmath77 parameter such that the `` local '' interaction strength in the reaction region is accounted for in the average . however , the penetration and therefore the interaction region changes with incident energy and q - value . </S>",
    "<S> very likely , the observed energy dependence of v@xmath77 is actually produced to a large extent by the underlying density dependence which was taken into account explicitly in this work .    </S>",
    "<S> a clearer account of that effect could be obtained from elastic and inelastic scattering reaction calculations ( omp and dwba ) at different incident energies where one tries to reproduce the cross sections derived with density dependent interactions by omps and form factors from a single yukawa interaction .    </S>",
