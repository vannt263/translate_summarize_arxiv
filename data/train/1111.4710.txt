    "there is a significant amount of research devoted to finding gray codes for classes of permutations , where two permutations are considered adjacent if they differ by an involution of some special kind . for a survey of some key results we refer the reader to savage s paper  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 11 ) .",
    "the simplest and most elegant result in this area is the johnson - trotter algorithm  @xcite , providing an adjacent transposition gray code for all permutations of a finite set .",
    "the present work is motivated by king s recent paper  @xcite , providing a transposition gray code for the set of all indecomposable permutations of a finite set .",
    "the combinatorial interest in these permutations is long - standing , both comtet  @xcite and stanley  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  1 ,",
    "exercise 32 ) discuss them in their textbooks .",
    "as shown by ossona de mendez and rosenstiehl  @xcite , they are bijectively equivalent to rooted hypermaps .",
    "refining dixon s famous result  @xcite , stating that a random pair of permutations generates almost always a transitive group is also related to enumerating indecomposable permutations , see cori s work  @xcite .",
    "our main result is finding an adjacent transposition gray code for a signed variant of the indecomposable permutations , which we call _ sign - connected permutations of the set @xmath0_. the importance of this signed variant is highlighted by the fact that our sign - connected permutations encode the shelling types of the boundary of the hypercube . here",
    "we consider two shellings to be of the same type , if they may be transformed into each other by an isometry of the underlying hypercube .",
    "adjacent transpositions correspond to swapping adjacent entries in a list of facets .",
    "we achieve our goal in two steps .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : gray ] , we provide a very simple adjacent transposition gray code for a larger class of permutations , which we call _ standard permutations of the set @xmath1_. the simplicity of this code is comparable to the simplicity of the output of the johnson - trotter algorithm . the second step , contained in section  [ sec : conn ] , is to show the following , surprisingly simple statement : an adjacent transposition gray code for the class of sign - connected permutations of @xmath1 may be obtained from the gray code of all standard permutations by simply deleting those standard permutations of @xmath1 which are not sign - connected .",
    "although the statement is very simple , its proof requires a careful look at a special way of coding standard permutations of @xmath1 .",
    "this coding is inspired by the place - based inversion tables , introduced for ordinary permutations in  @xcite .",
    "our result justifies the hope that the same coding applied to ordinary permutations may help us find an adjacent transposition gray code for indecomposable permutations , if such a gray code exists .",
    "our standard permutations are bijectively equivalent to _ standard double - occurrence words _ with @xmath2 symbols . as shown by ossona de mendez and rosenstiehl  @xcite , these words are bijectively equivalent to rooted maps with @xmath3 edges , this result was later refined by drake  @xcite .",
    "standard double - occurrence words are also bijectively equivalent to fixed point free involutions , as defined by cori  @xcite . under these bijections ,",
    "sign - connected standard permutations correspond to connected rooted maps and indecomposable fixed - point free involutions .",
    "our gray codes may be useful in the study of these related objects .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in the preliminaries",
    "we gather a few basic facts on permutation gray codes and shellings of the boundary of a hypercube that we will need .",
    "we also define sign - connected permutations of @xmath1 . in section  [ sec : hyp ]",
    "we introduce standard permutations of @xmath1 and show that the sign - connected standard permutations are bijectively equivalent to the shelling types of the boundary of an @xmath2-dimensional hypercube .",
    "the fact that standard sign - connected permutations correspond to standard double - occurrence words is shown in section  [ sec : arc ] where we also introduce arc diagrams that help visualize standard permutations of @xmath1 .",
    "essentially the same visualization was used by drake  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the place - based noninversion tables introduced in  @xcite , we introduce a new encoding of our arc diagrams .",
    "it is this encoding that makes the definition of the simple gray code for all standard permutations in section  [ sec : gray ] truly easy .",
    "essential properties of this gray code are explored in section  [ sec : prop ] .",
    "finally , our main result may be found in section  [ sec : conn ] .    our result highlights a connection between the study of hypermaps and the theory of shellings which may be worth exploring further in the future .",
    "it also raises the hope that , by using a similar encoding to the one introduced in  @xcite , one could find an adjacent transposition gray code for indecomposable permutations . finally ,",
    "although a large amount of literature exists on shelling and shellability , very little has been done to explore the set of all shellings of the same object .",
    "our paper is among the first in this new direction .",
    "given a finite set @xmath4 with @xmath2 elements , we define a _ permutation _ of @xmath4 as a word @xmath5 in which every element of @xmath4 appears exactly once .",
    "we denote the set of all permutations of @xmath4 by @xmath6 . given any subset @xmath7 of @xmath8 , we consider the following graph on the vertex set @xmath7 : the unordered pair @xmath9 is an edge if @xmath10 and @xmath11 differ by an _ adjacent transposition _ , i.e. , there is an @xmath12 such that @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "adjacent transposition gray code for @xmath7 _ is a hamiltonian path in the resulting graph .",
    "obviously not all sets of permutations have such a gray code .",
    "the johnson - trotter algorithm generates an adjacent transposition gray code on the set @xmath8 of all permutations of the set @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath17 , this algorithm recursively defines the gray code as follows : set the initial permutation as @xmath18 ; replace each permutation in the gray code for permutations of length @xmath3 with @xmath2 new permutations of length @xmath2 ; for each of the length @xmath3 permutations , insert @xmath2 into every position @xmath19 through @xmath2 to get the new permutations of length @xmath2 . for odd - indexed , length @xmath3 permutations , insert @xmath2 from right to left , and left to right for even - indexed permutations  @xcite .",
    "see table  [ tab : jt ] for the gray code when @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    ".the gray code produced by the johnson - trotter algorithm for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( read down ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ thm : fullgc ] the enumeration defined above is an adjacent transposition gray code for the standard permutations of the set @xmath22 .",
    "we proceed by induction on @xmath2 . comparing two consecutive words @xmath23 and @xmath24 , they differ in exactly one letter .",
    "we distinguish two cases , depending on whether this letter is the last letter of the word or some other letter .",
    "_ case 1 : _ @xmath25 . in this case , the associated standard permutations differ by an adjacent transposition since the first @xmath3 arcs in the two associated arc diagrams remain stationary , and the @xmath26 arc moves to the right or to the left by one vertex position .",
    "this move switches the left end of the @xmath26 arc with an adjacent end of a different arc . as mentioned at the end of section  [ sec : arc ]",
    ", switching adjacent ends of two arcs corresponds to an adjacent transposition on the associated signed permutation .",
    "_ case 2 : _ @xmath27 .",
    "this case occurs only if @xmath28 , corresponding to the @xmath26 arc stretching over the first @xmath3 arcs ; or if @xmath29 , which means the @xmath26 arc is a minimal arc .",
    "thus , in either situation , the @xmath26 arc will not affect whether or not the move produces an adjacent transposition in the associated standard permutations .",
    "by the recursive definition of the gray code , we replace @xmath30 with the next word in the gray code for words of length @xmath3 . by our induction hypothesis ,",
    "consecutive words in the gray code for words of length @xmath3 correspond to standard permutations on @xmath31 which differ by an adjacent transposition .",
    "the gray code for the equivalence classes of the enumerations of the facets of the boundary of the @xmath2-cube , referred to by their standard permutations , will be referred to as the _ full gray code_. as seen in section  [ sec : gray ] , this gray code may be defined in terms of a list of standard permutations in the form @xmath32 for each word @xmath33 .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath34 to represent the truncated word , obtained by removing the last letter of @xmath35 .    the collection of all words @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is fixed will be referred to as a run in the gray code for words .",
    "all words in a run form a sublist of codes corresponding to standard permutations differing by an adjacent transposition . in the run , only @xmath37 changes , either increasing from @xmath19 to @xmath38 or decreasing from @xmath38 to @xmath19 . a run is increasing if @xmath37 increases to get each subsequent word in the run .",
    "if an increasing run is the @xmath39 run in the gray code , then @xmath40 mod 2 .",
    "hence , increasing runs will also be referred to as odd runs .",
    "a run is decreasing if @xmath37 decreases to get each subsequent code in the run .",
    "if a decreasing run is the @xmath39 run in the gray code , then @xmath41 mod 2 .",
    "decreasing runs will also be referred to as even runs .",
    "note , odd and even refer to the count of the run and not whether @xmath42 is odd or even . for example , @xmath43 through @xmath44 is the first run in the gray code for words of length @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "however , @xmath47 through @xmath48 is the @xmath49 run in the gray code for words of length @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "several properties of the gray code follow directly from its definition :    1 .",
