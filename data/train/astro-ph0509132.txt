    "the antennae galaxies , ngc4038/39 ( arp244 ) , are probably the best - known example of a pair of interacting galaxies . at a distance of only 19.2  mpc ] @xcite the antennae system has been thoroughly studied over a large range of wavelengths .",
    "numerous observations that can not be listed here individually have been made at far - infrared , sub - millimeter and radio wavelengths .",
    "they generally agree that the most of the emission at longer wavelengths comes from the highly extincted overlap region .",
    "the largest molecular complexes have masses of @xmath4 , typically an order of magnitude larger than the largest structures in the disks of more quiescent spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "these authors also found an excellent correlation between the co emission and the @xmath5 m emission seen by _ iso _ @xcite .",
    "recent mid - ir observations at slightly higher spatial resolutions with _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite showed that the rate of star formation per unit mass in the active areas is comparable to those in starburst and some ultra - luminous galaxies .    the first deep optical analysis of the antennae with the wide field camera on _ hst _",
    "@xcite showed over 700 point - like objects .",
    "subsequent observations with _ wfpc2 _",
    "@xcite increased the sensitivity by 3 magnitudes in _ v _ band and revealed between 800 and 8000 clusters in four age ranges : _ ( i ) _ ages of @xmath6  myr around the edges of the overlap region and @xmath7  myr in the western loop , _ ( ii ) _ ages @xmath8  myr in the northeastern star formation region , _ (",
    "iii ) _ intermediate - age clusters of @xmath9  myr and _ ( iv ) _ old globular clusters from the progenitor galaxies .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite studied the statistical properties of the cluster population , @xcite and @xcite investigated the properties of selected `` super star clusters '' in greater detail .",
    "x - ray observations with _ chandra _",
    "@xcite revealed 49 sources , including several ultra - luminous x - ray ( ulx ) sources with x - ray luminosities of @xmath10ergs@xmath11 , suggesting these are binary accretion sources .",
    "so far , most studies of the star clusters in the antennae have been focused on a single wavelength regime with few exceptions : @xcite studied the relationship between young star clusters and the interstellar medium based on observations ranging from x - rays to the radio wavelengths , and @xcite correlated optically detected star clusters with their radio counterparts from @xcite . @xcite",
    "combined ubvrjhk images to derive extinction maps for the antennae and found several red clusters .",
    "this paper is the first one of a series to study the correlation between the near - infrared sources based on the _ wirc _ images and their radio counterparts ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; subsequent papers @xcite focus on the correlation between the infrared and x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "here we present deep near - infrared observations of ngc4038/39 obtained with _",
    "wirc_. we give a brief description of the instrument , discuss the infrared morphology of the antennae galaxies , and our photometric methods . in section  [ secdiscussion ]",
    "we discuss the properties of the infrared sources and focus on the infrared sources with radio and optical counterparts .",
    "we observed ngc4038/39 with the new wide - field infrared camera _ wirc _ @xcite mounted to the prime focus of the @xmath12 hale telescope on palomar moutain .",
    "the observations were part of the commissioning of the instrument .",
    "the `` original '' version pixel@xmath13 rockwell hawaii - ii array that provides a @xmath14 field of view .",
    "] of _ wirc _ , which was used for the observations presented in this paper , featured a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath15 with a @xmath16 square pixel rockwell hawaii - i detector .",
    "_ wirc _ mounts at the telescope s f/3.3 prime focus",
    ". the instrument s seeing - limited optical design , optimized for the jhk near - ir atmospheric bands , includes a 4-element refractive collimator , two 7-position filter wheels that straddle a lyot stop , and a 5-element refractive f/3 camera .",
    "typical seeing - limited point spread functions are slightly oversampled with a @xmath17/pixel plate scale at the detector .",
    "we took the observations on 22 march 2002 under good atmospheric conditions but at high airmass ( @xmath18 ) . using gaussian fits to the stellar point sources within the fov we determined fwhm@xmath19 and fwhm@xmath20 .",
    "the observing procedure was controlled by a simple macro that commanded the telescope to 20 random dither positions for better redundancy and enlarged field of view . at each dither position two and eight",
    "exposures were taken in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters , respectively .",
    "because of the higher sky background the integration times were shorter in @xmath2 ( 7.27s ) than in @xmath1 ( 29.07s ) . the resulting total integration times were 19.38 minutes in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we carried out the data reduction in _ idl _ using a self - written procedure .",
    "first , we averaged multiple exposures of each position and subtracted the `` sky '' .",
    "since no additional observations of a nearby , blank sky had been taken , we computed the lowered ( 1/3 instead of 1/2 ) median of the 20 dither positions .",
    "the relative offsets between the pointings were sufficiently large so that the filtered image looks reasonably smooth with no noticeable residuals from the galaxies , serving as a good `` sky '' image .",
    "for diagnostic purposes we have also rebinned the `` sky '' image to quantify a possible underlying gradient from insufficiently subtracted diffuse emission of the galactic halos and found that such a contribution must be less than 8% , which corresponds to a photometric error of 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "however , this value is only an upper limit since it may also include contributions from a possible gradient in the sky background emission .",
    "the next step was to apply the flat - field , which was computed from two series of twilight exposures at high and low flux levels .",
    "five difference images between high and low flux twilights have been computed , inverted and normalized . finally , the median of those five frames was calculated and renormalized .",
    "the positional offset between the different images was derived from cross - correlating the individual images relative to a reference frame on an integer pixel grid .",
    "finally , the 20 aligned images were combined via the median technique .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 image of the entire fov is shown in figure  [ figantennaegal ] .",
    "( the @xmath1 band image shows similar structure and is not shown here . ) the image is clearly dominated by the two nuclei of the interacting galaxies . in the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies @xcite ngc4038",
    "is classified as sb(s)m  pec ( @xmath21 ) , while ngc4039 is classified as sa(s)m  pec ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "figure  [ fignuclei ] shows the @xmath2 image of both nuclei in more detail .",
    "while the nucleus of ngc4039 in the @xmath2 image looks very similar to the optical structure , the nucleus of ngc4038 looks very different .",
    "most notably , the dust lane in east - west direction has become almost invisible , replaced by the prominent spiral arm structure of an sb - type galaxy .    besides the two nuclei , the star clusters in the western loop and the southeastern overlap region are clearly visible .",
    "a color zoom into the overlap region is shown in figure  [ figoverlap ] , side - by - side with the optical wfpc2 image from @xcite .",
    "figure  [ clusterlumi ] illustrates the locations of all the near - ir sources detected in the _ wirc _ images .",
    "we discuss the infrared sources in more detail in section  [ secdiscussion ] .      because of the varying shapes of the clusters and the gradients of the underlying background the best method of cluster detection was by eye .",
    "small , compact `` smudges '' that could be distinguished from the background and were detectable at both @xmath1 and @xmath2 were selected , 229 sources in total , which are labeled in fig .  [ fignumbered ] .",
    "however , not all of these sources are good cluster candidates : eight are known stars , one is a background quasar , and many more lie outside the area with increased starburst activity .",
    "they are therefore not likely to be massive star clusters associated with the antennae galaxies . investigating their true nature",
    "is not the aim of this paper ; however , for completeness we list the 57 infrared sources , which are likely not antennae clusters , in table  [ tabnonclus ] .",

    "figure  [ clustercolor ] best illustrates the locations of the reddest sources . the ( @xmath39 ) color",
    "is indicated by the size of the dots for each individual cluster .",
    "the overlap region shows the largest concentration of red clusters , but red sources can also be found outside the overlap region , indicating that star formation is not restricted to the densest region in a global sense  similar to what @xcite found .",
    "vla radio observations by @xcite have revealed numerous compact radio sources , which can be either hii regions or supernova remnants",
    ". @xcite cross - correlated these sources with optical _ hst _ counterparts , which basically eliminates the sources that are isolated supernova remnants and not associated with a young cluster .",
    "we have cross - correlated the combined _ hst _ and vla sample from @xcite with the near - ir _ wirc _ sources , requiring that the positional matches are better than @xmath28 radially .",
    "the resulting list is shown in table  [ tabcombined ] .",
    "figure  [ clustercmd ] suggests that sources that have been detected with _ wirc _ , _ hst _ and vla do not have distinct infrared colors .",
    "in fact , they group almost symmetrically around the median ( @xmath39 ) value of the sample .",
    "it is also apparent that the radio sources are among the more luminous clusters of the sample .",
    "however , except for the two most luminous radio sources , figure  [ radiocorr ] shows no clear correlation between the radio and the infrared @xmath2 brightness .",
    "if the color of the clusters represent a certain evolutionary state rather than just foreground extinction one would expect some correlation between the radio flux density and the ( @xmath39 ) color .",
    "figure  [ radiocolor ] shows the vla radio flux as a function of the infrared color .",
    "however , no such correlation seems to be present , suggesting that the observed optical / infared luminosity is mainly a measure of extinction toward the young clusters , as discussed in section  [ reddest ] .    in order to investigate",
    "if there is a correlation between optical and infrared colors of the clusters that is _ not _ due to extinction we compare the the ( @xmath63 ) vs. ( @xmath39 ) colors in figure  [ optirccd ] .",
    "the effect of @xmath64 foreground extinction is indicated by the arrow . considering a scatter of about 0.5 magnitudes in the near - ir due to extinction and evolution ,",
    "the location of most data points in this diagram is consistent with extinction as the dominating effect .",
    "the most extreme outliers at the blue and red ends are statistically not significant and may be due to mismatches between the optical sources and the ir and/or radio sources .",
    "figure  [ optirccd ] also shows for each individual cluster its age as derived by @xcite . within the narrow age range and the errors associated with the age determinations , we find no obvious correlation between age and infrared color for these young clusters .",
    "a detailed discussion of the correlations between radio and optical properties of the young super star clusters in the antennae has been given by @xcite .",
    "however , their comparison is limited by the rather large optical extinction toward young clusters : while the radio - bright phase only lasts about 10  myr it takes already about 6  myr for a cluster to clear enough dust to reach @xmath65 @xcite . while they find a good correlation between the strength of the radio flux and the @xmath66 emission @xcite argue that very red clusters are not preferentially radio sources , contrary to earlier suggestions .",
    "our study , providing significantly reduced error bars on the cluster colors over a large range in extinction , confirms the finding that the color of young clusters is apparently not correlated with their radio brightness .",
    "there are two likely explanations for this finding .",
    "first , starbursts have a complex structure and the intrinsic color of a cluster is difficult to disentangle from patchy foreground extinction , which can introduce a significant scatter in fig .",
    "[ radiocolor ] .",
    "second , the radio emission from young clusters is predominantly produced by the most massive stars . although their strong stellar winds will quickly remove the surrounding gas and dust the associated timescales depend strongly on the stellar density distribution and possible age spread within the cluster @xcite .",
    "higher angular resolution at near - ir wavelengths combined with accurate photometry , eventually provided by jwst , will be of great importance .",
    "we have presented deep nir @xmath1 and @xmath2 band images of the antennae galaxies that cover a large area around the interaction zone .",
    "the images were obtained with the new palomar wide infrared camera _",
    "wirc_. we presented nir photometry for 176 non - stellar sources within the observed field of view and correlated the infrared properties of the clusters with catalogued sources from _ hst _ and the vla .",
    "our study of 27 clusters that have been detected by _ wirc _ , _ hst _ and the vla shows that these young clusters cover a wide range in color , which is likely to be a combination of extinction and evolution .",
    "the average screen extinction is about @xmath3  mag .",
    "however , the reddest colors , which are mainly located in the overlap region , suffer from @xmath67 magnitudes in extinction .",
    "we find no obvious correlation between the nir and the 6 cm radio properties of these clusters .",
    "our study illustrates the potential of multi - wavelength observations and modern , sensitive wide - field infrared cameras .",
    "we would like to thank the staff at palomar observatory for outstanding support .",
    "we also thank brad whitmore for providing his table of optical - radio counterparts in electronic form , and the referee whose comments helped to significantly improve the paper .",
