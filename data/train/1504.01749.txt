    "electron dynamics in a periodic potential subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field was the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental research for several decades @xcite .",
    "that interest on this particular subject derives from its unique energy spectrum , which as a function of the magnetic flux per lattice cell of the periodic potential reveals a fractal pattern , known as the hofstadter s butterfly ( due to the pattern resembling the butterflies ) .",
    "this is the first example of fractal pattern realized in a quantum system .",
    "the parameter which determines the fractal structure of the energy spectrum is the magnetic flux @xmath2 through a unit cell measured in units of the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "in the case of a weak magnetic field @xmath3 , first the periodic potential forms the bloch bands and then the external magnetic field splits each bloch band of the periodic potential into minibands of landau level ( ll ) type , the number of which is determined by the parameter @xmath2 . in the strong magnetic field regime ,",
    "the relevant parameter is @xmath4 which is zero when @xmath5 . in this case",
    ", the energy spectra of an electron can be described by the formation of the ll spectrum and then splitting of the ll states into minibands by the periodic potential . here the number of minibands is determined by the parameter @xmath6 , i.e. , for rational @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are integers , within a single ll there are @xmath9 minibands with @xmath8 degeneracy . to observe the fractal pattern in a reasonable range of the magnetic field ,",
    "the important requirement is that the lattice structure has a large period .",
    "this can be achieved in artificial superlattices based on semiconductor nanostructures @xcite .",
    "observation of a clear fractal pattern remained a challenge however .",
    "finally , in 2013 the hofstadter butterfly structure with clear fractal pattern was reported @xcite in monolayer and bilayer graphene @xcite . in these experiments , the periodic lattice with a period @xmath10 nm",
    "was created naturally by the moire pattern that appears when graphene is placed on hexagonal boron nitride with a twist @xcite .",
    "in addition to the natural formation of the period structure in graphene on boron nitride substrate , that system has also the unique relativistic energy dispersion , which results in special type of landau levels @xcite .    recently discovered new dirac - type materials , such as silicene and germanene @xcite bring in additional remarkable features and additional control parameters into the structure of the dirac energy spectrum .",
    "these materials are monolayers of silicon and germanium with hexagonal lattice structures where the low energy charge carriers are also massless dirac fermions @xcite just as in graphene @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) silicene was synthesized on ag(111 ) @xcite and zirconium diboride substrates @xcite , while germanene was grown on ag @xcite and pt @xcite substrates .",
    "the main difference between silicene / germanene and graphene is that due to the larger radius of the si / ge atom compared to the c atom , the corresponding hexagon lattices in germanene and silicene have _ buckled _ structure @xcite , i.e. , the two sublattices ( say @xmath11 and @xmath3 ) in these systems are displaced vertically by a finite distance @xmath12 . as a result ,",
    "silicene and germanene have large spin - orbit interactions , which opens the band gaps at the dirac points ( @xmath13 mev for silicene @xcite and @xmath14 mev for germanene @xcite ) . in the case of graphene , in contrast , the corresponding spin - orbit - induced gap is tiny , 25 @xmath15ev @xcite . the buckled structure of silicene / germanene lattice also allows for the band gap to be controlled by an applied perpendicular electric field @xcite and the size of the band gap increases almost linearly with the electric field .",
    "these properties have important implications for a highly correlated electron systems in these graphene - like but novel systems @xcite , in particular , in the fractional quantum hall effect regime @xcite .",
    "the buckled graphene - like materials with a strong spin - orbit interaction and sensitivity to the external electric field significantly modify the energy spectrum of the system , which should be also visible in the hofstadter s butterfly pattern of these materials .",
