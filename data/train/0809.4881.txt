    "the mapping class group @xmath6 of @xmath5 is the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath5 , modulo those isotopic to the identity .",
    "a random walk on @xmath6 is a markov chain on @xmath6 with transition probabilities @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a probability distribution on @xmath6 , and we will always assume that the starting point at time zero is the identity element in the group .",
    "the path space of the random walk is the probability space @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a sample path , namely a sequence of group elements @xmath0 corresponding to the location of the sample path at time @xmath1 .",
    "the measure @xmath11 restricted to the @xmath1-th factor gives the distribution of @xmath0 , which is the @xmath1-fold convolution of @xmath8 with itself , which we shall denote by @xmath12 .",

    "@xmath2 is a @xmath3-manifold constructed by gluing two handlebodies together using a random walk of length @xmath1 as the gluing map .",
    "the _ distance _ @xmath13 of a heegaard splitting is defined in terms of the complex of curves , which is a simplicial complex whose vertices are isotopy classes of simple closed curves in the surface , and whose simplicies are spanned by collections of disjoint simple closed curves .",
    "the disc set of a handlebody is the collection of simple closed curves which bound discs in the handlebody .",
    "the distance of a heegaard splitting is the minimal distance between the disc sets of the two handlebodies in the complex of curves . in this paper , we show that the distance of a random heegaard splitting grows linearly with the length of the random walk , assuming the following restrictions on the support of @xmath8 .",
    "we say a subgroup of the mapping class group is complete if the endpoints of its elements are dense in @xmath14 , and we require the semi - group generated by the support of @xmath8 to contain a complete subgroup of the mapping class group .",
    "[ theorem : main ] let @xmath6 be the mapping class group of a closed orientable surface of genus at least two . consider a random walk generated by a finitely supported probability distribution @xmath8 on @xmath6 , whose support generates a semi - group containing a complete subgroup of the mapping class group .",
    "then there are constants @xmath15 such that @xmath16 where @xmath13 is the distance of the heegaard splitting determined by @xmath0 .    in particular , the probability that the heegaard splitting distance of @xmath2 is greater than two tends to one .",
    "if a manifold has heegaard splitting distance greater than two then kobayashi @xcite and hempel @xcite show that the manifold is irreducible , atoroidal and not seifert fibered , which implies that the manifold is hyperbolic , by geometrization , due to perelman @xcite .",
    "this confirms a conjecture of w. thurston from @xcite , in which he suggests that most manifolds produced from heegaard splittings of a fixed genus should be hyperbolic .",
    "this may also be thought of as a result similar in spirit to thurston s dehn surgery theorem , which says that most fillings on a hyperbolic manifold with toroidal boundary give rise to hyperbolic manifolds ; we have shown that most heegaard splittings give rise to hyperbolic manifolds , though of course , for a very different definition of most .",
    "more recently , dunfield and w. thurston @xcite have conjectured that the volume of these random heegaard splittings should grow linearly with the length of the random walk .",
    "this follows from our work , and some recent results announced by brock and souto @xcite .",
    "lustig and moriah @xcite have shown that high distance splittings are generic for an alternative definition of genericity , using the lebesgue measure class on @xmath14 .",
    "the growth of the splitting distance has other implications for the resulting @xmath3-manifolds . by work of hartshorn @xcite ,",
    "theorem [ theorem : main ] shows that the probability that @xmath2 contains an incompressible surface of genus at most @xmath17 tends to zero as @xmath1 tends to infinity , and by scharlemann and tomova @xcite , the probability that the manifold has a heegaard splitting of lower genus tends to zero as @xmath1 tends to infinity .",
    "the torelli group is the subgroup of the mapping class group which acts trivially on homology .",
    "removing a standard handlebody from @xmath18 and gluing it back in using an element of the torelli group produces a homology sphere .",
    "the torelli group is complete , and so these results apply to the nearest neighbour random walk on the torelli group , which may be used to produce random heegaard splittings with trivial homology , which are also hyperbolic with asymptotic probability one .      masur and minsky @xcite showed that the mapping class group is weakly relatively hyperbolic . in particular , they showed that the relative space is quasi - isometric to the complex of curves , which is @xmath19-hyperbolic , though not proper .",
    "klarreich @xcite identified the gromov boundary of the complex of curves as @xmath20 , the space of minimal foliations on the surface . using work of kaimanovich and masur @xcite",
    "one may show that a random walk on the mapping class group converges to a minimal foliation in the gromov boundary almost surely .",
    "this defines a measure @xmath21 , known as harmonic measure , on the boundary , where the measure of a subset is just the probability that a sample path of the random walk converges to a foliation contained in that subset .",
    "this measure depends on the choice of probability distribution used to generate the random walk .",
    "for example , if we consider the _ reflected _ random walk generated by @xmath22 , then if @xmath8 is not symmetric , this may produce a different harmonic measure , which we shall call the reflected harmonic measure , and denote @xmath23 .",
    "masur and minsky @xcite showed that the disc set @xmath24 is a quasiconvex subset of the complex of curves .",
    "consider a element @xmath25 of the mapping class group , whose stable and unstable foliations are disjoint from the limit set of the disc set . as the disc set is quasiconvex ,",
    "its nearest point projection onto an axis for @xmath25 has bounded diameter , and so if the translation length of @xmath25 is large , the nearest point projections of @xmath24 and @xmath26 to the axis will be disjoint .",
    "in fact , the distance between the two discs sets will be roughly the translation length of @xmath25 minus the diameter of the projection of the disc set to the axis .",
    "we need to show this situation is generic for group elements arising from random walks .",
    "in @xcite we showed that a random walk @xmath0 gives a element with asymptotic probability one .",
    "however , we also need to show that its stable and unstable foliations lies outside the limit set of the disc set with asymptotic probability one .",
    "we start by showing that the harmonic measure of the limit set of the disc set is zero , using a result of kerckhoff @xcite that says any train track may be split finitely many times to produce a train track disjoint from the disc set .",
    "we then show that the distribution of pairs of stable and unstable foliations @xmath27 in @xmath28 converges to the product of harmonic measure and reflected harmonic measure on @xmath28 .",
    "we briefly explain why one would expect this to be the case .",
    "the first observation is that if @xmath25 is a element of large translation length , then the stable foliation of @xmath25 lies in the boundary of the halfspace @xmath29 , where the halfspace @xmath29 consists of all points in the relative space at least as close to @xmath25 as to @xmath30 .",
    "this is an elementary property of hyperbolic translations in a @xmath19-hyperbolic space , and the corresponding statement follows for the unstable foliations , which is contained in the halfspace @xmath31 .",
    "this indicates that the distribution of the pairs of stable and unstable foliations should be closely related to the distribution of pairs @xmath4 .",
    "a sample path @xmath32 converges to a minimal foliation @xmath33 almost surely , and it can be shown that for large @xmath1 , the element @xmath34 lies in the halfspace @xmath35 determined by the midpoint @xmath0 of the sample path @xmath32 , with asymptotic probability one .",
    "this is illustrated on the left hand side of figure [ picture6 ] below .",
    "the corresponding statement therefore holds for the inverse of the sample path , i.e. the endpoint of the inverse path @xmath36 lies in the halfspace determined by the midpoint of the sample path .",
    "if we denote the increments of the sample path by @xmath37 , then @xmath36 is equal to @xmath38 , so the midpoint is given by @xmath39 .",
    "this is illustrated on the right hand side of figure [ picture6 ] above .",
    "therefore the distribution of pairs @xmath40 is closely related to the distribution of midpoints of sample paths @xmath41 . however , the first half of the sample path @xmath42 is independent of the second half of the sample path @xmath43 , and so independent of its inverse @xmath44 , as well .",
    "therefore these pairs are independently distributed according to the product @xmath45 , which converges to @xmath46 , namely the product of harmonic measure and reflected harmonic measure on @xmath28 . to make this argument precise",
    ", we use the fact that as sample paths converge to the boundary , the relative length of the sample path @xmath47 tends to infinity almost surely .",
    "therefore we may estimate the probability that the pair of stable and unstable foliations lie in a particular subset @xmath48 of @xmath28 in terms of the probability that the pair @xmath49 lies in a `` halfspace neighbourhood '' @xmath50 of this set , where @xmath51 is the union of all halfspaces @xmath52 with @xmath53 which intersect @xmath54",
    ". we will be able to get upper and lower bounds for the different measures of @xmath55 in terms of various @xmath56-neighbourhoods of the original set , and the asymptotic results will then follow from taking limits as @xmath57 tends to infinity , as @xmath58 for any closed subset of @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that the asymptotic distribution of stable and unstable endpoints of elements is @xmath59 shows that the probability that @xmath0 is with neither endpoint in the disc set is asymptotically one .",
    "consider a pair of disjoint closed sets @xmath60 and @xmath61 of @xmath20 , which are also both disjoint from the limit set of the disc set .",
    "there is an upper bound on the distance of any geodesic with one endpoint in @xmath60 and one endpoint in @xmath61 from the identity element of the group .",
    "furthermore , there is an upper bound on the diameter of the nearest point projection of the disc set @xmath24 onto any such geodesic .",
    "the proportion of elements of a random walk of length @xmath1 which are with stable foliation in @xmath60 and unstable foliation in @xmath61 is asymptotic to @xmath62 .",
    "as the relative length of @xmath0 grows linearly in @xmath1 , as shown in @xcite , this shows that the distance between @xmath24 and @xmath63 also grows linearly for this collection of elements .",
    "however , the complement of the collection of such sets @xmath48 in @xmath28 is just the union of the diagonal with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and so has measure zero .",
    "therefore , the probability that the splitting distance is roughly linear in @xmath1 tends to one asymptotically .",
    "we now give a brief overview of the organization of the paper . in section [ section :",
    "preliminaries ] we review some standard definitions and previous results . in section [ section : disc set ] , we show that the limit set of the disc set has harmonic measure zero , and then in section [ section : independence ] , we show that the joint distribution of stable and unstable endpoints of elements converges to the product of harmonic and reflected harmonic measure on @xmath28",
    ". finally , in section [ section : distance ] , we show that the distance of a random heegaard splitting grows linearly in the length of the random walk .",

    "let @xmath5 be an orientable surface of finite type , i.e. a surface of genus @xmath25 with @xmath66 marked points , usually referred to as punctures .",
    "the mapping class group @xmath6 of @xmath5 consists of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath5 which preserve the punctures , modulo those isotopic to the identity . for the purposes of this paper we shall assume that @xmath5 is not a sphere with three or fewer punctures .",
    "the collection of essential simple closed curves in the surface may be made in to a simplicial complex , called the the _ complex of curves _ , which we shall denote @xmath67 .",
    "the vertices of this complex are isotopy classes of simple closed curves in @xmath5 , and a collection of vertices spans a simplex if representatives of the curves can be realised disjointly in the surface .",
    "the complex of curves is a finite dimensional simplicial complex , but it is not locally finite",
    ". we will write @xmath68 for the distance in the one - skeleton between two vertices @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the complex of curves",
    ". we will fix a basepoint for the complex of curves , which we shall denote @xmath71 .",
    "the mapping class group acts by simplicial isometries on the complex of curves . for certain sporadic surfaces the definition above produces a collection of disconnected points , and",
    "so a slightly different definition is used .",
    "if the surface is a torus with at most one puncture , then two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding simple closed curves may be isotoped to intersect transversely exactly once .",
    "if the surfaces is a four punctured sphere , then two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding simple closed curves may be isotoped to intersect transversely in two points . in both of these cases ,",
    "the resulting curve complex is isomorphic to the farey graph .",
    "a geodesic metric space is _",
    "@xmath19-hyperbolic _ if every geodesic triangle is @xmath19-slim , i.e. each edge is contained in a @xmath19-neighbourhood of the other two .",
    "masur and minsky @xcite have shown that the complex of curves is @xmath19-hyperbolic .",
    "the mapping class group is finitely generated , so any choice of generating set @xmath60 gives rise to a word metric on @xmath6 , and any two different choices of finite generating set give quasi - isometric word metrics . given a group @xmath6 , and a collection of subgroups @xmath72",
    ", we define the _ relative length _ of a group element @xmath25 to be the length of the shortest word in the typically infinite generating set @xmath73 .",
    "this defines a metric on @xmath6 called the _ relative metric _ , which depends on the choice of subgroups @xmath74 .",
    "we will write @xmath75 to denote the group @xmath6 with the relative metric , which we shall also refer to as the _ relative space_. we will write @xmath76 for the relative distance between two group elements @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and we will also write @xmath79 for the smallest distance between two sets @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "the quasi - isometry is given by @xmath83 , where @xmath71 is a fixed basepoint for the complex of curves .",
    "as the complex of curves is @xmath19-hyperbolic , this shows that the mapping class group is weakly relatively hyperbolic .",
    "the gromov boundary of the complex of curves , and hence the relative space , is the set formed by taking the foliations in @xmath14 , the space of projective measured foliations on the surface , whose trajectories contain no closed curves , and forgetting the measures , as shown by klarreich @xcite , see also hamensddt @xcite .",
    "this space , denoted @xmath20 , is hausdorff , but not compact .",
    "we will write @xmath84 for the union of @xmath75 with its gromov boundary @xmath20 .",
    "a element @xmath25 of the mapping class group acts as a hyperbolic isometry on the relative space , and so has a unique pair of fixed points in the boundary , which we shall call the stable and unstable foliations of @xmath25 . following ivanov @xcite",
    ", we say that a subgroup @xmath85 of the mapping class group is _ complete _ , if the stable and unstable foliations of elements of @xmath85 are dense in @xmath14 .",
    "we now review some background on random walks on groups , see for example woess @xcite .",

    "the position of the random walk at time @xmath1 may be described as the product @xmath88 , where the @xmath37 are the _ increments _ of the random walk , i.e. the @xmath37 are a sequence of independent @xmath8-distributed random variables",
    ". therefore the distribution of random walks at time @xmath1 is given by the @xmath1-fold convolution of @xmath8 , which we shall write as @xmath12 , and we shall write @xmath89 for the probability that you go from @xmath69 to @xmath70 in @xmath1 steps .",
    "we shall always require that the group generated by the support of @xmath8 is _ non - elementary _ , which means that it contains a pair of elements with distinct fixed points in @xmath14 .",
    "we do not assume that the probability distribution @xmath8 is symmetric , so the group generated by the support of @xmath8 may be strictly larger than the semi - group generated by the support of @xmath8 . throughout this paper we will need to assume that the probability distribution @xmath8 has finite support , and in order to show that the disc set has harmonic measure zero",
    ", we will need to assume that the semi - group generated by the support of @xmath8 contains a complete subgroup of the mapping class group .    in @xcite , we showed that it followed from results of kaimanovich and masur @xcite and klarreich @xcite , that a sample path converges almost surely to a uniquely ergodic , and hence minimal , foliation in the gromov boundary of the relative space .",
    "this gives a measure @xmath21 on @xmath20 , known as _",
    "harmonic measure_. the harmonic measure @xmath21 is @xmath8-stationary , i.e. @xmath90    @xcite [ theorem : converge ] consider a random walk on the mapping class group of an orientable surface of finite type , which is not a sphere with three or fewer punctures , determined by a probability distribution @xmath8 such that the group generated by the support of @xmath8 is non - elementary .",
    "then a sample path @xmath91 converges to a uniquely ergodic foliation in the gromov boundary @xmath20 of the relative space @xmath75 almost surely , and the distribution of limit points on the boundary is given by a unique @xmath8-stationary measure @xmath21 on @xmath20 .",
    "we remark that the measure @xmath21 is supported on the uniquely ergodic foliations , which are a subset of @xmath14 , so it is possible to consider @xmath21 as a measure on @xmath14 , with zero weight on all the non - uniquely ergodic measures .",
