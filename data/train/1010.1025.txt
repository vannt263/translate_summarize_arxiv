    "ever - improving observations suggest a concordant picture of our universe . in this picture , generally called @xmath6 , `` dark energy , '' the component responsible for the universe s accelerated expansion , is believed to be the energy of the vacuum with a constant equation of state parameter , @xmath7 , equal to @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath6 has been measured via probes of the universe s expansion rate such as type ia supernovae , the primary cosmic microwave background , and baryon acoustic oscillations .",
    "however , @xmath6 also makes concrete predictions about the universe s growth of structure .",
    "this growth rate describes how quickly dark matter halos form and evolve over cosmic time .",
    "a deviation from this predicted growth rate , particularly on linear scales , would signal a breakdown of @xmath6 ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a handful of techniques have been available for measuring the growth of structure in the universe .",
    "these largely consist of observing the weak and strong lensing of background sources by intervening matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , measuring distortions in redshift space with spectroscopic surveys of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and quantifying the abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this latter technique is one of the oldest and has been maturing with the advent of large area x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surveys .",
    "millimeter - wave surveys now possess the resolution and sensitivity to detect galaxy clusters .",
    "detecting galaxy clusters via the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect in large area millimeter - wave maps , as have become available through the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite and the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite , is a potentially powerful method .",
    "cluster selection using the sz effect @xcite is the technique whose selection function is least dependent on cluster redshift .",
    "this allows for a complete picture of the evolution of clusters from their first formation to the present .",
    "here we probe structure growth with a measurement of the abundance of massive galaxy clusters from observations made by the act project in 2008 .",
    "we focus on the most massive sz - selected clusters as this is the regime where high signal - to - noise measurements exist and we can best understand the cluster astrophysics .",
    "we also note that the clusters considered in this work are rare and represent the tail of the mass distribution , which is sensitive to the background cosmology .",
    "this analysis uses the number of massive galaxy clusters to constrain , in particular , the normalization of the matter power spectrum , @xmath9 , and the dark energy equation - of state - parameter , @xmath7 .",
    "this paper is structured as follows :  [ sec : background ] describes the sz effect and the act sz cluster survey .",
    " [ sec : catalog ] describes the 2008 act high - significance cluster sample . in  [ sec : results ] , we present our results , and in  [ sec : discuss ] , we discuss their implications and conclude .",
    "the thermal sz effect arises when primary cosmic microwave background photons , on their path from the last scattering surface , encounter an intervening galaxy cluster . the hot ionized gas within the cluster inverse compton scatters about @xmath10 of the cmb photons , boosting their energy and altering the intensity of the microwave background as a function of frequency at the location of the cluster @xcite .",
    "to first order , the effective temperature shift ( which is proportional to the intensity shift ) , at a frequency @xmath11 , from the thermal sz effect is given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the number density and temperature of the electron distribution of the cluster gas , @xmath15 is the line - of - sight path length through the cluster , @xmath16 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant , and    @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the usual compton y - parameter . note that the full sz effect contains relativistic corrections as in @xcite , which we include in our simulations . for our sample , these corrections are 5 to 10% .",
    "we take eq .",
    "[ eqn : tsz ] , describing the first - order thermal sz effect , as the definition of @xmath19 we use throughout this work , and treat the relativistic corrections as an additional source of noise ( see  [ subsec : yrecov ] ) .    at frequencies below 218 ghz , where the signal is null , @xmath20 is negative , and the cluster appears as a cold spot in cmb maps . above the null , @xmath20 is positive , and the cluster appears as a hot spot .",
    "[ eqn : tsz ] is also redshift independent , and the amplitude of the intensity shift is to first order proportional only to the thermal pressure of the cluster .",
    "this makes the sz effect especially powerful for two reasons : the microwave background can trace all the clusters of a given thermal pressure that have formed between the last scattering surface and today in a redshift independent way , and the amplitude of this effect , being proportional to the thermal pressure , is closely related to the cluster mass .",

    "we find good agreement in the average profiles of the clusters in the data and simulated with the fiducial model as shown in figure [ fig : stackedclusters ] , which suggests that there is no significant misestimate of the sz signal for these massive systems .",
    "from table [ tab : constraints ] we see overall agreement between @xmath131 and @xmath7 as measured with only wmap7 and as measured with the high - significance act cluster sample plus wmap7 .",

    "marginalizing over the uncertainty in this scaling relation , we find @xmath135 and @xmath1 , an uncertainty comparable to that of wmap7 alone .",

    "this analysis also suggests consistency between the fiducial model of cluster astrophysics used here to describe massive clusters and the data .",
    "table [ tab : constraints ] shows agreement in best - fit cosmological parameters between growth rate and expansion rate probes when we hold fixed our fiducial relation between sz signal and mass .",
    "when we allow the scaling relation parameters to be free , we find best - fit values that are broadly consistent with those of our fiducial relation .",
    "we note that while the @xmath122 range of the @xmath81 parameter is higher than the fiducial value , the fiducial value is enclosed by the @xmath150 range of @xmath151 .",
    "the higher value of the @xmath81 parameter may indicate some curvature in the true scaling relation away from the fiducial model at the high - mass end .",
    "this may also be suggested by figure [ fig : scalingrelation ] where the simulated clusters seem to prefer higher @xmath19 values than the fiducial relation would suggest for the most massive systems .",
    "the agreement between cosmological parameters from expansion rate and growth of structure probes when fixing the sz signal - mass scaling relation to the fiducial model and the broad agreement between fiducial and best - fit scaling relation parameters when the latter are allowed to be free , suggest our data is broadly consistent with expectations for the sz signal of massive clusters .",
    "this is also suggested by comparing the stacked sz detected clusters in the data with simulations as shown in figure [ fig : stackedclusters ] .",
    "we would expect the above to be the case as massive clusters have been studied far better than lower mass clusters with a variety of multi - wavelength observations .",
    "in addition , a number of astrophysical processes that are not perfectly understood , such as nonthermal processes and point source contamination , affect the gas physics of lower mass clusters much more than that of the most massive systems .",
    "in general , these processes tend to suppress the sz power spectrum over that of a straightforward extrapolation based on the most massive systems .",
    "this is an important effect as lower mass systems ( @xmath152 ) contribute as much to the sz power spectrum at @xmath153 as systems at higher mass @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum near @xmath154 has been recently measured by and discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are a number of ways the cosmological constraints presented here could be further improved .",
    "clearly the largest uncertainty is the relation between sz signal and mass , and further x - ray observations of massive clusters , particularly at higher redshifts where x - ray observations have been limited , would help to calibrate this relation .",
    "further targeted observations of massive clusters at millimeter - wave frequencies with enough resolution and sensitivity to identify point sources would offer a better handle on contamination levels .",
    "in addition , an analysis using multiple frequency bands , which would employ the spectral information of the sz signal , may be helpful in determining cluster sizes and measuring integrated @xmath44s .",
    "this could help reduce the scatter in the relation between sz signal and mass .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts of all the clusters in a given sz sample would also help to reduce uncertainty on the cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , millimeter - wave maps with lower instrument noise , would greatly reduce the scatter between the recovered and true sz signal .",
    "such maps are expected with actpol @xcite and sptpol @xcite coming online in the near future .    with continued sz surveys such as act and spt and their polarization counterparts , in addition to data forthcoming from the _ planck _ satellite , we will no doubt increase the number of sz cluster detections .",
