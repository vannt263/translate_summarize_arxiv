    "stars in moving groups with small internal velocity dispersions share a common space motion , which can be used to establish membership based on measurements of radial velocities or proper motions , or both . whereas many such kinematic membership studies have been carried out for open clusters ( e.g. , van leeuwen 1985 ; van altena et al .",
    "1993 ) , there are few such studies for nearby ob associations .",
    "these loose stellar groups have internal velocity dispersions of at most a few km / sec ( cf .",
    "mathieu 1986 ) , so the stars share a common space motion , but they generally cover tens to hundreds of square degrees on the sky .",
    "ground - based proper motion studies therefore almost invariably have been confined to modest samples of bright stars ( @xmath0 ) in fundamental catalogs , or to small areas covered by a single photographic plate .",
    "photometric studies can extend membership to later spectral types , but are less reliable . as a result , membership for many associations",
    "has previously been determined unambiguously only for spectral types earlier than b5 ( e.g. , blaauw 1991 ) .",
    "the advent of hipparcos allows a major step forward in our understanding of the nearby associations .",
    "we are carrying out a census of ob associations within 800  pc from the sun based on the hipparcos measurements ( see hoogerwerf et al .",
    "1997 ; de zeeuw et al .",
    "the parallaxes and proper motions allow kinematic membership determination in the nearby associations to unprecedented accuracy , and for stars significantly fainter than accessible previously .",
    "this requires an objective and reliable way to identify moving groups in the hipparcos catalog . here",
    "we present a new procedure to do just this , and illustrate its application by considering the well - studied upper scorpius subgroup of the scorpio ",
    "centaurus association ( e.g. , blaauw 1978 ) .",
    "the common space motion of stars in a nearby moving group results in converging proper motions .",
    "we developed a modern implementation of a classical convergent point method ( brown 1950 ; jones 1971 ) .",
    "this method searches for the maximum likelihood coordinates @xmath1 of the convergent point by minimizing the sum over all @xmath2 stars in the data sample of the squared and error - weighted proper motion components @xmath3 perpendicular to the direction to the corresponding convergent point .",
    "this sum is distributed as @xmath4 with @xmath5 degrees of freedom . if , after global minimization with respect to @xmath6 , the value of @xmath4 is unacceptably high , the star with the highest value of @xmath3 is rejected , after which minimization is repeated until a satisfactory value of @xmath4 is obtained .",
    "subsequently , all non - rejected stars are identified as members .",
    "this procedure allows for simultaneous convergent point determination and membership selection .    in order to make optimal use of the hipparcos data",
    ", we developed a new kinematic membership selection method which uses , besides proper motions , also parallaxes . in this method ,",
    "each star is characterized by a line in velocity space : the proper motion and parallax determine the offset from the origin ( tangential velocity ) , while the sky position of the star determines its direction ( radial velocity ; cf.figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the errors and correlations of the astrometric parameters transform the line into an elliptic cylinder .",
    "the cylinders of a set of stars with the same space motion all intersect .",
    "thus , we can identify moving groups by searching for maxima in the density of cylinders in velocity space . all stars",
    "whose 3 sigma cylinders contain a maximum are selected as member of the associated group .",
    "the membership probability depends on the velocity dispersion of the group , and on the errors in the measurements .",
    "we have tested both methods on the hyades cluster . based on hipparcos data and radial velocities , perryman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) identified 218 members which have three - dimensional space motions consistent with the cluster motion within 3@xmath7 limits . within 10  pc of the cluster center ( @xmath8 , the tidal radius )",
    ", our membership list agrees very well with that of perryman et al .",
    "furthermore , we have performed extensive tests of both methods based on numerically simulated data sets of moving groups superimposed on a kinematic model of the galactic disk .",
    "we have varied the position of the group on the sky , as well as its distance , streaming motion , internal velocity dispersion , and number of members .",
    "the observational errors and covariance matrix for each simulated star were chosen to be consistent with the data in the hipparcos catalog .",
    "these tests indicate , in order of decreasing importance , that ( i ) a clear identification of the moving group requires it to stand out kinematically from the galactic field distribution ; and ( ii ) an increasing distance of the moving group complicates its identification .",
    "when proper motions combined with parallaxes do not allow the separation of the moving group from the galactic field , accurate radial velocities are an indispensable tool in establishing kinematic membership ( cf .",
    "the case of orion ob1 discussed by de zeeuw et al .",
    "1997 )    both methods take the full hipparcos covariance matrix into account .",
    "neither method requires a priori knowledge on the ( existence or characteristics of the ) moving group .",
    "we combine the independent results of the two methods to define membership criteria : we consider as secure members all stars that are selected by both methods . here",
    "we restrict our discussion to these stars .",
    "classical kinematic membership studies for upper scorpius identified 59 proper motion members with spectral types earlier than b8 ( blaauw 1946 ; bertiau 1958 ; jones 1971 ) .",
    "several photometric studies suggested membership for another 32 stars down to spectral type a8 ( hardie & crawford 1961 ; garrison 1967 ; gutierrez  moreno & moreno 1968 ; glaspey 1971 , 1972 ; de geus et al .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig2 ] display the hipparcos measurements for these 91 pre - hipparcos members .",
    "our hipparcos data sample for upper scorpius ( cf .",
    "second panel row of figure  [ fig2 ] ) is limited to the field @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with the extra restriction @xmath11 , which provides a boundary with the subgroup upper centaurus lupus of sco ob2 ( cf .",

    "we also detect the association in the f - type stars , but not as convincing as in the early - type stars .",
    "we find no signature of a moving group in the g - type stars .",
    "therefore , we decided to use the 120 b and a - type members to define the space motion of upper scorpius . then , we select the f , g , k , and m - type stars that have a space motion consistent with that of the early - type members",
    ". this results in 58 co - moving members .",

    "the small hole in the vector point diagram around @xmath20  mas / yr indicates that a few field stars might erroneously have ended up as members ( see discussion below ) .",
    "analysis of the parallax distribution results in a mean distance @xmath21  pc ( where the quoted error corresponds to the error in the mean parallax ) , which can be compared to the value of @xmath22  pc obtained by de geus et al .",
    "the intrinsic depth of the association is not resolved by the hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "the observed large spread in the vector point diagram is consistent with zero internal velocity dispersion .",
    "it can be fully explained by the combined effects of observational errors and projection on the sky .",
    "unfortunately , this implies that the study of internal motions in associations based on hipparcos proper motions is beyond our current capabilities .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the positions and proper motions for all the hipparcos members , as a function of spectral type .",
    "the figure shows that there is a clear concentration in the early - type stars , surrounded by a group of ` outliers ' .",
    "however , all stars in figure  [ fig3 ] have astrometric parameters that are consistent with the space motion of the subgroup . we can remove interlopers ( field stars ) by using the radial velocity to determine the three - dimensional space motion for each star , and comparing it to that of the subgroup . in the absence of a coherent and homogeneous set of radial velocities for the majority of stars in our list of hipparcos members ,",
    "we have estimated the number of expected interlopers by monte ",
    "carlo simulation .",
    "we find that the observed clustering in the f - type star distribution can not be explained by galactic disk contamination , whereas the majority of the g - type stars can be explained as such .",
    "the main concentration of f - type stars has spectral types earlier than @xmath23f5 .",
    "the hayashi time scale for mid - f type stars is of the order of 5  myr , which is comparable to the age of upper scorpius estimated from the hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagram ( e.g. , de geus et al .  1989 ) .",
    "if stars of later spectral types have formed in upper scorpius they should lie above the main sequence .",
    "as these objects lie near the faint limit of the hipparcos catalog , careful analysis is needed to establish their numbers .",
    "we have developed a new method for identifying moving groups in velocity space , based on all five astrometric parameters obtained by hipparcos .",
    "combination of this method with a modern version of a classical convergent point method leads to a powerful procedure for identifying moving groups in the hipparcos catalog .",
    "we applied this procedure to hipparcos data for 21 fields related to the nearby ob associations .",
    "results for some of these fields are described by hoogerwerf et al .",

    "( 1997 ) , the latter of which also gives a general overview of the project .",
    "here we present results for upper scorpius .",
    "we establish a significant improvement of the pre - hipparcos membership list , and an extension of it to much later spectral types including f - type stars , for a total of 178 kinematic members .",
    "our membership list represents a suitable working set of stars ; radial velocities are needed to remove remaining interlopers .",
    "the hipparcos proper motions do not allow an analysis of the internal kinematics of upper scorpius .",
