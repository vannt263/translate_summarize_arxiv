    "one of the most natural questions in convex geometry is how well a convex body can be approximated by polytopes .",
    "the efficiency of approximation is measured by either the number of facets or the number of vertices of the polytope .",
    "there are different ways to measure how closely a polytope approximates a convex body .",
    "for instance , one can approximate a convex body @xmath0 by an inscribed or a circumscribed polytope @xmath5 and measure the difference between their volumes or mean - widths . in this paper , we are interested in one of the most natural measurements , the banach - mazur distance . for symmetric convex bodies",
    ", we have the following definition : any @xmath9 symmetric convex bodies in @xmath10 , the banach - mazur distance @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 in particular , @xmath13 is a multiplicative distance for symmetric convex bodies .",
    "the problem of approximating by a polytope is well understood in the symmetric case . if @xmath14 , which is the unit euclidean ball , then a polytope @xmath5 with @xmath15 facets will satisfy @xmath16 .",
    "this lower bound has obtained independently by 4 different groups of people adopted different approaches .",
    "( see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) recently , a.  barvinok @xcite has shown that for any symmetric convex body @xmath4 , one can find a polytope that has @xmath15 facets such that @xmath17 . in other words , the relation between the banach - mazur distance and the number of facets is well understood .",
    "+ for the non - symmetric case , we have to modify the definition of the banach - mazur distance : for @xmath9 convex bodies in @xmath10 , the banach - mazur distance @xmath11 is defined by @xmath18 unlike the symmetric case , the choice of the center is crucial . for a symmetric convex body , all natural centers such as the center of mass , the center of the john ellipsoid , the santalo point etc .",
    ", coincide with the center of symmetry .",
    "this is not the case for a general convex body .",
    "that is , given @xmath0 and @xmath19 , how does one choose the best center of scaling , @xmath20 described in the definition of @xmath11 ?",
    "moreover , it is not necessarily true that one of the classical invariant fixed points of the convex bodies is the best choice .",
    "for instance , for the non - symmetric @xmath21 problem , m.  rudelson @xcite uses the center as an interlacing point between two classical invariant fixed points for the upper @xmath21 estimate .",
    "there are two positive results in the non - symmetric case .",
    "both of them uses the center of mass as the center of scaling .",
    "the best upper bound is provided by s.  szarek ( @xcite ) , which says that for any convex body in @xmath10 , there exists a polytope that has @xmath15 facets or @xmath15 vertices ) such that @xmath22 . using a random method , s.  brazitikos , g.  chasapis , and l.  hioni get an upper bound of order @xmath23 where @xmath15 is the number of vertices .",
    "s.  szarek uses the center of mass of the approximating polytope @xmath5 as the center of scaling . on the other hand",
    ", s.  brazitikos , g.  chasapis , and l.  hioni uses the center of mass of the convex body @xmath0 as the center of scaling .    in this paper",
    ", we are examing the case when taking the center of scaling as the center of john ellipsoid of @xmath0 .",
    "john ellipsoid of a convex body @xmath0 is the unique maximized volume ellipsoid contained in @xmath0 .",
    "a convex body is in john s position if its maximal volume ellipsoid is the unit euclidean ball , @xmath24 . for any convex body @xmath0",
    ", there exists an affine transformation so that it could map @xmath0 to a convex body in john s position .",
    "if we consider convex bodies in john s position , then , we automatically taking the center of its john ellipsoid as the origin .",
    "the only known proof of showing that a symmetric convex body @xmath0 can be approximated by a polytope @xmath5 with polynomial in @xmath3 facets so that @xmath25 relies on john s position . using the contact points @xmath26 that form the identity decomposition ( see definition below ) , we form the polytope @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "( using the approximated john s decomposition , this can be improved to @xmath29 . ) in particular , @xmath5 satisfies , @xmath30 thus , @xmath31 . moreover",
    ", the result of a.  barvinok we mentioned before relies on john s decomposition as well . although john s position exists for all convex bodies , the same construction in non - symmetric scenario can only provide @xmath32 which shows that @xmath33 .",
    "given that so far the only means of obtaining a distance of @xmath34 in the symmetric case is through john s position , one can ask whether john s position in the non - symmetric case can yield a better approximation .",
    "we have the following question :    suppose a convex body @xmath4 is in john s position .",
    "is there a polytope @xmath5 with a polynomial number of facets in @xmath3 such that @xmath35 when @xmath36 ?    in this paper , we answer this question negatively .    for a sufficiently large @xmath3 and for any @xmath37",
    ", there exists a convex body @xmath4 in john s position such that any polytope @xmath5 satisfying @xmath38 has at least @xmath39 facets , where @xmath40 are some universal constant .    observe that the result of the main theorem is invariant under linear transformations but not under affine transformations .",
    "thus , using the center of john ellipsoid of @xmath0 as the scaling center is not good for approximation by polytopes with few facets .",
    "an immediate consequence is the following :    let @xmath41 be a positive increasing sequence that satisfies @xmath42 . for any constant @xmath43 , there exists a convex body @xmath4 in john s position for a sufficiently large @xmath3 such that there is no polytope that has at most @xmath44 number of facets that satisfy @xmath45    in the other extreme we have the following corollary :    for a sufficiently large @xmath3 , there exists a convex body @xmath4 in john s position such that there is no polytope @xmath5 that has less than @xmath7 number of facets , and this satisfies @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a universal constant .",
    "the fact that the theorem can not provide a better result when @xmath48 is not surprising .",
    "using a net argument , one can derive the following :    suppose @xmath49 .",
    "for a sufficiently small @xmath50 , there exists a polytope @xmath51 that has no more than @xmath52 facets such that @xmath53    applying the proposition to convex bodies in john s position we have    for a sufficently large @xmath3 , let @xmath0 be a convex body in @xmath10 in john s position .",
