    "such a loop ( radius @xmath222.5 cm ) may be approximated by a mirror with a reflection coefficient of about 95%  @xcite .",
    "the fiber ends are collected in one bunch , squeezed , cut and polished , and connected to a photo - detector though a small air gap .",

[ apd_unit ] .",
    "because the new calorimeter photo - detector ( apd ) draws a typical photo - current of less than 0.1 ma , an economical way to build the calorimeter hv system is to develop an active , compact individual hv - unit mounted directly into each apd housing .",
    "this kind of hv system eliminates expensive and bulky hv cables and connectors , lowers the power consumption per individual power supply , and reduces the electrical hv hazard associated with traditional hv supplies .    in the test measurements ,",
