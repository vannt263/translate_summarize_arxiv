    "for these applications , high efficiency requires large optomechanical coupling strength in addition to sideband resolution ( mechanical frequency @xmath2 optical linewidth ) .",

    "phonon pair generation  @xcite , mechanical mode entanglement  @xcite , and unresolved sideband cooling  @xcite have also been theoretically proposed . in all these systems , improved performance and broader applicability could be achieved if the optical and mechanical modes could be independently tailored to a given application .    the slot - mode optomechanical crystal structure , in which the optical and mechanical modes are confined in separate but interacting beams ( fig .  [ fig : schem ] ) , is one method of achieving this flexibility while maintaining large optomechanical coupling strength .",
    "simulations  @xcite have shown that , in systems in which the optomechanical interaction is dominated by moving boundaries , this geometry can significantly increase the optomechanical coupling strength relative to single nanobeam optomechanical crystals .",
    "it also provides the desired design flexibility to enable multimode applications such as optomechanical wavelength conversion .    in this work ,",

    "[ sec : tnbs ] , we extend the slot - mode optomechanical crystal concept to multimode optomechanical devices , in which two mechanical modes are coupled to a single optical mode , and two optical modes are coupled to a single mechanical mode .",
    "a slot - mode optomechanical crystal , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem]b , consists of two parallel beams separated by a narrow slot .",
    "the `` optical beam '' is a photonic crystal cavity designed to confine the optical mode in the slot .",
    "the `` mechanical beam '' is a phononic crystal resonator optimized to confine the mechanical breathing mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem]c ) while maintaining low optical loss .",
    "both the optical and mechanical modes are confined along the @xmath3-axis by periodic patterning of holes . in the outer mirror region ,",
    "the lattice spacing is constant , but it varies quadratically in the cavity region ( fig .  [ fig : schem]a ) .",
    "details on the design of this device are outlined in ref .",
    "the devices in this work were designed for optical modes around 980  nm and mechanical breathing modes around 3.4  ghz .",
    "the optical beam is patterned with identical elliptical holes ( 188  nm@xmath4330  nm ) along its length , while the mechanical beam holes have a constant height ( 370  nm ) and widths that are varied such that the `` ribs '' between the holes align with the elliptical holes in the optical beam",
    ".    there have been several demonstrations of sideband - resolved single - nanobeam optomechanical crystals  @xcite , in which a ghz frequency mechanical breathing mode is coupled to an optical mode localized by the same physical structure .",
    "these geometries are distinguished by the breathing mode s high frequency ( enabling sideband resolution ) , isolation from mechanical supports due to the phononic mirrors , and strong interaction with the optical mode .",
    "our goal in this work is to retain these advantageous features while increasing the system s versatility through the slot mode geometry .",
    "optical slot modes have been utilized before to achieve large optomechanical coupling in microrings / disks  @xcite , bilayer photonic crystal slabs  @xcite , and photonic crystal zipper cavities  @xcite .",
    "these applications were lower frequency ( @xmath5  mhz ) than the 3.4  ghz band breathing modes in this work , and , thus operated in the unresolved - sideband regime ( mechanical frequency @xmath6 optical linewidth ) .",
    "in addition , previous demonstrations have not taken full advantage of the flexibility of the slot mode architecture , as the mechanical and optical modes were supported by the same structural components .",
    "separating the optical and mechanical modes into two beams enables independent design of these modes .",
    "this opens a wide range of frequency combinations that would be difficult to access with a single optomechanical structure .",
    "the slot - mode structure also opens the possibility for additional interactions with both modes , which can be separately accessed from the beam sides opposite the slot .",
    "for example , electrodes could be added to the outside of the mechanical beam with minimal perturbation of the optical mode .",
    "adding more optical or mechanical beams , thereby forming more slots , can also increase the device functionality by realizing multimode optomechanical systems , as discussed in secs .",

    "the blue detuning of the laser further increased the measurement stability by enabling access to the thermally self - stable regime  @xcite so that the laser did not have to be externally locked to the cavity .",

    "in addition , with the laser blue - detuned ( @xmath33 ) , optomechanical back - action coherently amplifies the mechanical mode , increasing the detected amplitude while decreasing the effective mechanical linewidth @xmath34 . assuming only optomechanical damping changes with input power , the effective linewidth is related to the optical power at the coupling point to the device @xmath24 as follows , where @xmath35 is the intrinsic optical loss rate , @xmath36 is the external coupling rate , @xmath37 is the optical resonant frequency , and @xmath38 is the intrinsic mechanical frequency @xcite :    @xmath39    thus",

    "we note that the measured threshold powers are much lower , and the mechanical - linewidth - narrowing slopes much steeper , than would be expected with the @xmath9 values obtained from the phase modulator calibration method .",

    "in sec .  [ sec : initmeas ] , we use the phase modulator calibration method  @xcite to measure the optomechanical coupling @xmath9 of slot - mode optomechanical crystals .",
    "the @xmath72 of the electro - optic phase modulator must be accurately known in order to do this calibration .    to measure @xmath72",
    ", we send the 980  nm laser signal through the phase modulator , modulated at 3.5  ghz by an rf signal generator , and into a scanning fabry - prot interferometer .",
    "the detected signal traces out the carrier and phase - modulator - induced sidebands in the optical signal , and we view them on an oscilloscope , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vpi]a .        changing the power applied by the rf signal generator to the phase modulator changes the magnitude of the carrier and sidebands .",
    "the rf power @xmath73 is related to the signal voltage @xmath74 , where the phase modulator input impedance @xmath75 . knowing this",
    ", we can graph the peak magnitudes with respect to @xmath76 , as shown in fig  [ fig : vpi]b . for a phase modulator ,",
    "the carrier peak magnitude should follow the curve @xmath77 , and the first sideband magnitude should follow the curve @xmath78 , where @xmath79 scales the amplitude of the bessel functions of the first kind @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we fit data from the carrier and first sideband to these functions in fig .",
    "[ fig : vpi]b , and both fits result in @xmath82  v , where the uncertainty comes from the fit and is one standard deviation .",
    "this value corresponds well with the vendor - specified value for the phase modulator .",
    "in addition to the example m - o - m device in sec .  [",
    "fig : momdata ] , we fabricated and characterized an m - o - m device in which a 400  mhz band mechanical beam and a 1.8  ghz band mechanical beam surround an optical beam , with 80  nm slots between the beams , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : momlm]b .",
    "the resultant optical mode is concentrated in both slots simultaneously ( fig .",
    "[ fig : momlm]a ) .",
    "we couple to the optical mode by hovering the ftw a few hundred nanometers above the optical beam .",

    "fig : momlm]d ) . for the same input optical power ,",
    "the detected 400  mhz band mode has a larger amplitude than the 1.8  ghz band mode primarily because a lower frequency mode has a larger thermal noise motional amplitude for the same temperature . as with the other devices in this work , the mechanical spectrum ( fig .

    "this power spectral density plot is referenced to a power of 1  mw = 0  db . ]",
    "these slot - mode optomechanical crystals confine multiple optical modes in the slot in addition to the fundamental mode for which they were designed .",
    "we observed some of these higher - order modes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hoopt]a and b. because they are distributed more widely along the slot , these modes couple less strongly to the highly - localized breathing mode and more strongly to other mechanical modes in the device , such as higher - order breathing - type mechanical modes arising from fabrication defects  @xcite .    in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : hoopt ] , a device with a designed , stress - tuned slot width of 20  nm has an optical mode at @xmath89  nm with an intrinsic optical @xmath90 as well as an optical mode at @xmath85  nm with an intrinsic optical @xmath91 . when pumped at the 949  nm fundamental optical mode , it self - oscillates at the @xmath92  ghz mechanical breathing mode , and we begin to see sidebands due to mixing with the modulation from the low - frequency flexural beam modes , as described in sec .  4 of the main text .",
    "however , even with 50  % more optical power , the mechanical breathing mode does not self - oscillate when pumped at the 971  nm optical mode .",
    "in addition , the mechanical spectrum reveals another peak at @xmath93  ghz with about the same optomechanical coupling to the 971  nm mode as the @xmath92  ghz mode , suggesting that this higher - order optical mode is also coupling to some higher - order , less - well - confined mechanical mode .",
