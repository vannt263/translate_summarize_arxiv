    "this paper concerns with mixed interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ( mip - dg ) approximations of the following cahn - hilliard problem : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is a bounded domain , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a nonconvex potential density function which takes its global minimum zero at @xmath6 . in this paper , we only consider the following quartic potential density function : @xmath7    after eliminating the intermediate variable @xmath8 ( called the chemical potential ) , the above system reduces into a fourth order nonlinear pde for @xmath9 , which is known as the cahn - hilliard equation in the literature .",
    "this equation was originally introduced by john w. cahn and john e. hilliard in @xcite to describe the process of phase separation , by which the two components of a binary fluid spontaneously separate and form domains pure in each component . here @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote respectively the concentrations of the two fluids , with @xmath6 indicating domains of the two components .",
    "we note that the equation  differs from the original cahn - hilliard equation in the scaling of the time , and @xmath11 here corresponds to @xmath12 in the original formulation .",
    "@xmath13 , which is positively small , is called the interaction length .    besides its important role in materials phase transition",
    ", the cahn - hilliard equation has been extensively studied due to its close relation with the hele - shaw problem .",
    "it was first formally proved by pego @xcite that the chemical potential @xmath14 tends to a limit which satisfies the following free boundary problem known as the hele - shaw problem : @xmath15 , \\label{eq1.5}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n } & = 0 & & \\quad \\mbox{on } { \\partial}\\omega,\\ t\\in[0,t ] , \\label{eq1.6}\\\\ w & = \\sigma\\kappa & & \\quad \\mbox{on } \\gamma_t,\\ t\\in[0,t],\\label{eq1.7}\\\\ v & = \\frac{1}{2 } \\bigl [ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n } \\bigr]_{\\gamma_t } & & \\quad \\mbox{on } \\gamma_t,\\ t\\in[0,t],\\label{eq1.8 }    \\ ] ] as @xmath16 , provided that the hele - shaw problem has a unique classical solution . here",
    "@xmath17 @xmath18 and v represent the mean curvature and the normal velocity of the interface @xmath19 . a rigorous justification that @xmath20 in the interior or exterior of @xmath19 for all @xmath21 $ ] as @xmath16 was given by stoth @xcite for the radially symmetric case , and by alikakos , bates and chen @xcite for the general case . in addition , chen @xcite established the convergence of the weak solution of the cahn - hilliard problem to a weak ( or varifold ) solution of the hele - shaw problem .",
    "moreover , the cahn - hilliard equation ( together with the allen - cahn equation ) has become a fundamental equation as well as a building block in the phase field methodology ( or the diffuse interface methodology ) for moving interface and free boundary problems arising from various applications such as fluid dynamics , materials science , image processing and biology ( cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the diffuse interface approach provides a convenient mathematical formalism for numerically approximating the moving interface problems because explicitly tracking the interface is not needed in the diffuse interface formulation .",
    "the main advantage of the diffuse interface method is its ability to handle with ease singularities of the interfaces . like many singular perturbation problems ,",
    "the main computational issue is to resolve the ( small ) scale introduced by the parameter @xmath13 in the equation .",
    "computationally , the problem could become intractable , especially in three - dimensional cases if uniform meshes are used .",
    "this difficulty is often overcome by exploiting the predictable ( at least for small @xmath13 ) pde solution profile and by using adaptive mesh techniques ( cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) , so fine meshes are only used in the diffuse interface region .",
    "numerical approximations of the cahn - hilliard equation have been extensively carried out in the past thirty years ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the majority of these works were done for a fixed parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the error bounds , which are obtained using the standard gronwall inequality technique , show an exponential dependence on @xmath22 .",
    "such an estimate is clearly not useful for small @xmath13 , in particular , in addressing the issue whether the computed numerical interfaces converge to the original sharp interface of the hele - shaw problem .",
    "better and practical error bounds should only depend on @xmath22 in some ( low ) polynomial orders because they can be used to provide an answer to the above convergence question , which in fact is the best result ( in terms of @xmath13 ) one can expect . the first such polynomial order in @xmath22 a priori estimate was obtained in @xcite for mixed finite element approximations of the cahn - hilliard problem . in addition , polynomial order in @xmath22 a posteriori error estimates were obtained in @xcite for the same mixed finite element methods .",
    "one of the key ideas employed in all these works is to use a nonstandard error estimate technique which is based on establishing a discrete spectrum estimate ( using its continuous counterpart ) for the linearized cahn - hilliard operator .",
    "an immediate corollary of the polynomial order in @xmath22 a priori and a posteriori error estimates is the convergence of the numerical interfaces of the underlying mixed finite element approximations to the hele - shaw flow before the onset of singularities of the hele - shaw flow as @xmath13 and mesh sizes @xmath23 and @xmath24 all tend to zero",
    ".    the objectives of this paper are twofold : firstly , we develop some mip - dg methods and to establish polynomial order in @xmath22 a priori error bounds , as well as to prove convergence of numerical interfaces for the mip - dg methods .",
    "this goal is motivated by the advantages of dg methods in regard to designing adaptive mesh methods and algorithms , which is an indispensable strategy with the diffuse interface methodology .",
    "secondly , we use the cahn - hilliard equation as another prototypical model problem @xcite to develop new analysis techniques for analyzing convergence of numerical interfaces to the underlying sharp interface for dg ( and nonconforming finite element ) discretizations of phase field models . to the best of our knowledge , no such convergence result and analysis technique is available in the literature for fourth order pdes .",
    "the main obstacle for improving the finite element techniques of @xcite is that the dg ( and nonconforming finite element ) spaces are not subspaces of @xmath1 .",
    "as a result , whether the needed discrete spectrum estimate holds becomes a key question to answer .",
    "this paper consists of four additional sections . in section [ sec-2 ]",
    "we first collect some a priori error estimates for problem - , which show the explicit dependence on the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we then cite two important technical lemmas to be used in the later sections .",
    "one of the lemma states the spectral estimate for the linearized cahn - hilliard operator . in section [ sec-3 ]",
    ", we propose two fully discrete mip - dg schemes for problem ",
    ", they differ only in their treatment of the nonlinear term . the first main result of this section is to establish a discrete spectrum estimate in the dg space , which mimics the spectral estimates for the differential operator and its finite element counterpart .",
    "the second main result of this section is to derive optimal error bounds which depends on @xmath22 only in low polynomial orders for both fully discrete mip - dg methods . in section [ sec-4 ] , using the refined error estimates of section [ sec-3 ] , we prove the convergence of the numerical interfaces of the fully discrete mip - dg methods to the interface of the hele - shaw flow before the onset of the singularities as @xmath25 and @xmath24 all tend to zero .",
    "finally , in section [ sec-5 ] we provide some numerical experiments to gauge the performance of the proposed fully discrete mip - dg methods .",
