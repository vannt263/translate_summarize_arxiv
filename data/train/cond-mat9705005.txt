    "the study of @xmath0 dimensional inhomogeneous fluids has traditionally focused on systems which retain some degree of translational invariance @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , the adsorption of a fluid at a solid substrate modelled as a structureless wall which exerts a one - body potential on the fluid particles .",
    "if the interface is planar the equilibrium local number density depends on the normal distance from the wall ( @xmath1 , say ) and the excess free energy is proportional to the area @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "if we suppose that the bulk fluid ( infinitely far away from the wall ) corresponds to a phase @xmath3 ( e.  g.  vapour ) attention focuses on the possibility of adsorbing a layer of phase @xmath4 ( e.  g.  liquid ) at the wall-@xmath3 interface . at bulk two - phase coexistence one of two scenarios",
    "is possible . above the wetting temperature",
    "@xmath5 the thickness of the adsorbed layer is infinite while below @xmath5 it is finite .",
    "the wetting phase transition occurs as @xmath6 and may be first- or second - order corresponding to the discontinuous or continuous divergence in the height of the @xmath7 interface ( measured from the wall ) , respectively .    for a non - planar or rough boundary",
    "the problem poses new difficulties due to an even greater loss of translational invariance .",
    "however , recently a number of independent approaches have been developed to meet such a challenge @xcite .",
    "simple phenomenological arguments @xcite indicate that the increase in contact angle @xmath8 @xcite at the non - planar interface is controlled by the roughness parameter @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the surface area of the rough wall . while this has been confirmed at low temperatures @xmath11 using rigorous methods @xcite , mean - field studies @xcite suggest a more complicated scenario in the vicinity of a planar second - order wetting transition temperature .",
    "consider , for example , a corrugated wall described by a local height variable @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the root mean square width of the corrugations and @xmath14 is their period .",
    "analytical analysis based on a landau - type free energy functional @xcite shows that the transition is driven first - order for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is _ smaller _ than the bulk correlation length of the @xmath4 phase .",
    "this first - order wetting transition occurs at a lower temperature than the second - order phase boundary ( denoted @xmath5 ) for the planar system . for @xmath17",
    "the phase transition remains second - order and occurs at the _ same _ temperature @xmath5 , i.  e.  there is no wetting temperature shift .",
    "it is natural to question the robustness of this result when fluctuation effects , occurring outside the mean - field approximation , are included . in @xmath18 ( which is the marginal dimension for short - range forces )",
    "one would expect the topology of the surface phase diagram to remain largely unchanged @xcite .",
    "however in @xmath19 fluctuation effects may be extremely strong and modifications are quite possible .",
    "indeed , recent numerical work suggests that the important parameter is not @xmath20 but @xmath21 , the roughness exponent for the substrate .",
    "clearly , for a corrugated wall @xmath22 but giugliarelli and stella @xcite have considered self - affine substrates for which the average height fluctuation @xmath23 for a sample of length @xmath24 scales like @xmath25 .",
    "their numerical results strongly indicate that for @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the thermodynamic roughness exponent @xcite , the transition remains continuous .",
    "however for @xmath28 it appears to be first - order .    in the present article",
    "we describe details of an exact transfer matrix analysis of wetting at a corrugated wall which confirms the numerically based suggestion that the transition remains second - order . as we shall see",
    "the analysis is considerably more involved than the planar example and requires some care .",
    "importantly we shall show that in contrast to mean - field expectations the wetting transition temperature is reduced by corrugation even if the order of the transition is unaffected .",
    "consider a wall corrugated so that even sites are @xmath13 lattice spacings higher than odd sites ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "our approach evokes a restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) approximation to the semi - infinite ising model ( valid at low temperatures ) which has proven to be very profitable for examining wetting transitions @xcite .",
    "any overhangs of the interface are ignored ( as are bubbles of @xmath3 phase in the @xmath4 phase and vice versa ) so that a single valued variable measuring the height of the interface from the wall can be used .",
    "to finish our introduction we briefly recall the hamiltonian for the planar system ( @xmath29 ) and suppose that the wall has @xmath30 sites and contact potential @xmath31 , @xmath32 = \\sum_{n=1}^n \\left\\ { j|u_{n+1}-u_n| - w \\delta_{u_n,0 } \\right\\ } \\label{hstandard}\\ ] ] the variable @xmath33 measure the height of the interface at site @xmath34 and @xmath35 , is the usual coupling parameter which suppresses bending fluctuations . here",
    "periodic boundary conditions imply that @xmath36 and with the rsos constraint adjacent heights are restricted such that @xmath37 . with this assumption",
    "we note that the boltzmann weight is @xmath38 where we have introduced the notation @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 ) and set @xmath41 .",
    "the model exhibits a second - order wetting transition when @xmath42 satisfies @xcite @xmath43 which is the correct low temperature limit of the exact ising model result @xcite .",
    "as adjacent interface configurations are restricted there are only two cases that need to be considered    ( )    @xmath44 for this value of @xmath13 the interface can access every site of the wall and the hamiltonian is @xmath45 = \\sum_{n=1}^n \\left\\ { j|u_{2n}-u_{2n-1}|+j|u_{2n}-u_{2n+1}| - w ( \\delta_{u_{2n-1},a-1}+ \\delta_{u_{2n},a } ) \\right\\ } \\label{h1}\\ ] ]    @xmath46 for all @xmath47 the interface can not reach odd sites and still obey @xmath37 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in other words there exists sites that are never accessed .",
    "while this may appear to be an artifact of the rsos constraint , in an unrestricted interface such configurations would cost enormous bending energy and so would be very rare .",
    "consequently we expect the rsos approximation to produce little error , particularly for larger values of @xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath48",
    "= \\sum_{n=1}^n \\left\\ { j|u_{2n}-u_{2n-1}|+j|u_{2n}-u_{2n+1}| -   w \\delta_{u_{2n},a } \\right\\ } \\label{h2}\\ ] ]    it is in fact possible to account for both these scenarios with only one hamiltonian @xmath32 = \\sum_{n=1}^n \\left\\ { j|u_{2n}-u_{2n-1}|+j|u_{2n}-u_{2n+1}| - w^ * \\delta_{u_{2n-1},a-1 } - w \\delta_{u_{2n},a } \\right\\ } \\label{h}\\ ] ] where here there are @xmath49 sites along the wall , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and periodic boundary conditions are still imposed ( @xmath52 ) . for @xmath53 and @xmath47",
    "the effective variable @xmath54 takes the values @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the partition function @xmath57 may be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is defined to be @xmath60 to simplify ( [ z ] ) we follow@xcite and write @xmath61 introducing a complete set of normalised eigenfunctions @xmath62 such that @xmath63 with the over - bar denoting complex conjugation , allows @xmath57 to be rewritten @xmath64 if the eigenfunctions are chosen to satisfy @xmath65 then by using ( [ eigen ] ) repeatedly , ( [ inter ] ) becomes @xmath66 \\label{lambdas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the maximum eigenvalue . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath68 the free energy density @xmath69 reduces to @xmath70 where we have used ( [ lambdas ] ) . as usual the calculation of the free energy reduces to the problem of finding the largest eigenvalue of the matrix equation ( [ eigen ] ) .",
    "consider ( [ eigen ] ) when @xmath71 @xmath72 where the superscripts have been dropped for convenience .",
    "using the boltzmann factor ( [ restrict ] ) this reduces to @xmath73 \\left [ j(\\delta_{u',v+1}+\\delta_{u',v-1})+\\delta_{u',v } \\right ] & \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times \\sqrt{w^*}^{(\\delta_{u , a-1}+\\delta_{v , a-1 } ) } w^{\\delta_{u',a } } \\psi_u",

    "this gives @xmath79 which in turn simplifies to @xmath80 \\left[t^2+j^{-1}(1+\\sqrt{\\lambda})t+1 \\right ] = 0 \\label{factor}\\ ] ] denoting the roots @xmath81 and @xmath82 for each bracket we see that @xmath83 with ( [ free ] ) having a general solution @xmath84 for some constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "however we expect the eigenfunction @xmath75 to be finite as @xmath87 and so if the @xmath88 are real we can choose without loss of generality , see ( [ fs ] ) , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which implies that @xmath91 and @xmath86 must vanish in ( [ sofar ] ) .",
    "notice that this is not true if the roots are complex and then @xmath92 for some @xmath8 . by considering the discriminants of ( [ factor ] )",
    "it is straight forward to show @xmath93 for some @xmath94 and @xmath8 , and @xmath95 for some @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the eigenfunction @xmath75 is @xmath98 for @xmath74 . in the thermodynamic limit only the maximum eigenvalue contributes to",
    "the free energy and so for low temperatures ( for which the eigenfunction must correspond to a bound state ) we have @xmath99 and ( [ soln ] ) is valid for @xmath100 wetting will occur when any @xmath88 turns complex . from ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t3 ] )",
    "this will happen first for @xmath101 when @xmath102 decreases to @xmath103 to deal with the boundary conditions , i.  e.  ( [ res ] ) for values of @xmath104 , we extend the solution ( [ soln ] ) to the range @xmath105 and impose @xmath106 due to the rsos constraint",
    ". then ( [ res ] ) for @xmath107 and @xmath108 gives a set of equations for @xmath109 and @xmath110 . these are best written in matrix form @xmath111-j^2 & jt_3[(w-1)jt_3 - 2]-j^2 \\\\ 0 & j^2 & -j^2t_1 & -j^2 t_3   \\end{array } \\right ) & \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\psi_{a-1 } \\\\ \\psi_a \\\\ a_0 \\\\ a_1 \\end{array } \\right ) = 0 & \\label{lam0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to have non - trivial solutions the matrix , @xmath112 say , must have zero determinant @xmath113 which is a ( complicated ) equation for @xmath114 in terms of @xmath101 and @xmath115 .",
    "from here one can of course proceed analytically but the task is laborious and ideally suited for computer algebra packages .",
    "using mathematica @xmath114 can be obtained exactly and then used to solve ( [ lam0 ] ) , remembering the normalization condition @xmath116 .",
    "the resulting expressions for @xmath109 and @xmath110 are very long and not particularly illuminating",
    ".    however , exactly at wetting ( [ wet ] ) holds and it is easy to demonstrate from ( [ t1real ] ) and ( [ t3real ] ) that @xmath117 and defining @xmath118 equation ( [ lam ] ) can be shown to become @xmath119 which gives the wetting temperature .",
    "as an aside , we point out that our method of solution is quite versatile and can be very simply adapted to study the situation considered by nechaev and zhang @xcite .",
    "these authors have a periodic potential at a planar wall  @xmath55 taking the values @xmath120 and @xmath121 at odd and even sites respectively .",
    "their hamiltonian is @xmath32 = \\sum_{n=1}^n \\left\\ { j|u_{2n}-u_{2n-1}|+j|u_{2n}-u_{2n+1}| - w_0 \\delta_{u_{2n-1},0 } - w_1 \\delta_{u_{2n},0 } \\right\\}\\ ] ] which is very similar to ( [ h ] ) .",
    "indeed , away from the wall ( [ free ] ) still holds and only the elements in the matrix @xmath112 change .",
    "wetting again occurs when @xmath122 and using the same techniques as before the wetting temperature is found to obey @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 . with a little effort",
    "this can be shown to be equivalent to equation ( 14 ) in @xcite which provides a useful check for the validity of our method .",
    "we consider the two possible wall configurations separately    ( )    @xmath44 in this case @xmath126 and ( [ tw2 ] ) is a quadratic equation in @xmath127 .",
    "hence we arrive at @xmath128 for the wetting phase boundary @xmath129 . for fixed values of @xmath55 and",
    "@xmath130 the wetting temperature @xmath131 is reduced from its value @xmath5 in the planar case , which from ( [ tpi ] ) satisfies @xmath132 to see this first assume @xmath133 then since @xmath134 and @xmath39 we have @xmath135 as @xmath136 . using ( [ w1 ] ) and ( [ wpi ] ) , equation ( [ ineq1 ] ) implies the inequality @xmath137 or ( as @xmath138 ) @xmath139 this then gives @xmath140 but @xmath141 from ( [ q ] ) and so @xmath142 indicating that @xmath143 . however , this is a contradiction  from ( [ q ] ) we have @xmath144 and hence the assumption ( [ assump ] ) is false . thus @xmath131 is lower than @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath46 now @xmath145 implying @xmath146 and ( [ tw2 ] ) gives @xmath147 where we write @xmath148 defining the wetting temperature @xmath149 for @xmath47 .",
    "the shift of the wetting phase boundary can be seen following a similar method to that given above .",
    "first assume @xmath150 which then implies , @xmath151 and recall from ( [ q ] ) , @xmath152 .",
    "it is straight forward to see , via ( [ w2 ] ) , that @xmath153 for all @xmath154 , and @xmath155 .",
    "hence ( [ q12 ] ) gives @xmath156 .",
    "then , defining @xmath157 , ( [ w12 ] ) becomes @xmath158 however one can also show from ( [ w1 ] ) and ( [ w2 ] ) that @xmath159 for @xmath154 , and @xmath160 .",
    "hence @xmath161 for this range of @xmath162 which contradicts ( [ wcompare ] ) based on the assumption ( [ assump2 ] ) .",
    "in summary we have proven that @xmath163 so that the larger the magnitude of corrugations of the wall the further reduced is the wetting temperature . inequality ( [ temps ] ) is simply explained using entropy arguments in the conclusion .",
    "finally we turn to a calculation of the critical exponents characterising the transition in the non - planar system .",
    "first consider the mean interface position above the wall defined by @xmath164}}{\\sum _",
    "{ \\ { u \\ } } { \\rm e}^{-h[u]}}\\ ] ] in the thermodynamic limit this can be written ( for any odd numbered site ) @xmath165 where we have expressed the wave - function normalization explicitly .",
    "the sums in ( [ uaverage ] ) are simple geometric progressions and are easily evaluated .",
    "expanding the result around the critical point @xmath166 shows the leading - order contribution to be @xmath167 where @xmath168 and so the adsorption critical exponent @xmath169 identical to the planar case @xcite .",
    "clearly the phase transition remains continuous and falls in the same universality class as the planar system .",
    "similar remarks apply to the singular contribution to the excess free energy and transverse correlation length @xmath170 . for example , for the free energy density we find @xmath171 for small @xmath172 , identifying the specific heat exponent @xmath173 .",
    "again , the exponent describing the divergence of the correlation length @xmath174 as expected @xcite .",
    "we have presented an exact analytic solution to the problem of wetting in two dimensions with a corrugated wall .",
    "the corrugations can be of arbitrary height without the transition losing its second - order character .",
    "the critical exponents governing thermodynamic quantities as the phase boundary is approached are unchanged from the planar case although the wetting temperature itself is reduced .",
    "these results contrast sharply with mean - field theory @xcite but support numerical studies in @xmath19 with self - affine ( rough ) walls @xcite .",
    "in fact both the @xmath19 and mean - field result suggest that by including thermal fluctuations second - order wetting transitions become roughness - induced first - order if the width of the wall ( as measured by a roughness exponent @xmath21 for @xmath175 and length scale @xmath13 for @xmath176 ) is larger than the analogous quantity for the fluid ( @xmath7 ) interface .",
    "our explicit calculations illustrate that the transition temperature is reduced by wall corrugation and to complete our article we make some comment on the generality of the results . below the upper critical dimension",
    "wetting transitions are bought about by entropy winning its competition with internal energy in the free energy of the interface . for a corrugated wall",
    "the internal energy of a bound state is less negative than the planar case because either there are fewer points of contact with the substrate if the @xmath7 interface is flat or an increased bending energy if it leaves the plane to reach the contact points .",
    "consequently entropy , which is hardly affected by the corrugation , needs to overcome an internal energy of reduced magnitude implying that the wetting temperature is decreased .    with this general argument",
    "we expect that the rsos result described here captures all the essential physics of the full ising model calculation ( at least at low temperatures ) .",
    "while an ising model solution would be very welcome the transfer matrix analysis would be much more complex and may be prohibitively difficult .",
