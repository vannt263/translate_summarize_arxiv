    "we applied our method to a chain of coupled standard maps and showed how the frequency of different regimes  and the transition probabilities between them  are related to the volume of different phase - space regions . using the consecutive time in distinct regimes we have reproduced previous results obtained using recurrence times and showed that our method allows for a significant improvement in the characterization of the sticky motion ( _ e.g. _ , in the determination of the scaling exponents ) .",
    "this indicates that our method can be used to characterize stickiness in general high - dimensional systems and is particularly suited for cases in which different regions of sticky motion coexist .",
    "we have also shown that the dependence on the coupling strength of the largest lyapunov exponents , after conveniently using our procedure , tend to follow only the qualitative universal properties of fully chaotic system .",
    "results obtained in a simple chain of standard maps confirm that our methodology can be applied to high - dimensional systems and problems of current interest , such as controlling fermi acceleration @xcite , galactic models @xcite , and plasma physics @xcite .",
    "another example of application is to associate each regime @xmath46 with effective hamiltonian functions , a procedure used to reproduce the complicated dynamics of kicking electrons @xcite or the high harmonic generation in laser - assisted collisions @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate chaos in mixed - phase - space hamiltonian systems using time series of the finite - time lyapunov exponents . </S>",
    "<S> the methodology we propose uses the number of lyapunov exponents close to zero to define regimes of ordered ( stickiness ) , semi - ordered ( or semi - chaotic ) , and strongly chaotic motion . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics is then investigated looking at the consecutive time spent in each regime , the transition between different regimes , and the regions in the phase - space associated to them . applying our methodology to a chain of coupled standard maps </S>",
    "<S> we obtain : ( i ) that it allows for an improved numerical characterization of stickiness in high - dimensional hamiltonian systems , when compared to the previous analyses based on the distribution of recurrence times ; ( ii ) that the transition probabilities between different regimes are determined by the phase - space volume associated to the corresponding regions ; ( iii ) the dependence of the lyapunov exponents with the coupling strength . </S>"
