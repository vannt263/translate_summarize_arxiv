    "positronium is a very specific two - body atomic system , which in some respects is similar to hydrogen , but some its features are quite different from those of the hydrogen atom . in particular , positronium is an unstable atom and the lifetime of its ground state is about @xmath0 or @xmath1  sec depending on its spin . because of that any experiments with positronium are much more complicated than those with hydrogen and considerably less precise . in this brief overview of positronium studies",
    "we will try to demonstrate that despite the existing experimental problems positronium is worth studying .",
    "the theory which describes simple atomic systems is bound state quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and the questions we are trying to answer in this paper are    * why do we have to study and test _ bound state qed _ ?",
    "* what are _ essential problems _ of present - day bound state qed ? * what is _ specific _ with _ positronium _ tests of qed ?",
    "bound state qed is quantum electrodynamics for the bound states and a problem of the bound states is a complicated one even in the case of classical physics .",
    "the bound state qed theory has been mainly developed to describe two - body and three - body atoms . even in the case of free mass - shell particles ,",
    "qed as a theory of interactions between leptons ( electrons and muons ) and photons is indeed incomplete .",
    "it faces a lack of pure qed description of the nucleon structure , hadronic vacuum polarization and other hadronic effects .",
    "such effects are unavoidable while calculating the spectrum of hydrogen , muonium and most of other simple atoms @xcite . for some applications the weak interaction is also involved into calculations , but in such a case it can often be done _ ab initio _ , while strong interaction effects require model - dependent evaluations , experimental data and phenomenological approaches .",
    "qed can not predict a number to be compared with some experimental value , producing instead some expressions which need appropriate values of fundamental constants .",
    "these constants as well as a number of auxiliary nuclear parameters should be determined experimentally .",
    "measurements of the constants and parameters are apparently a problem beyond qed . for most of the so called tests of bound state qed the accuracy",
    "is usually limited by factors related to non - qed phenomena and the actual goal of the study is rather to determine the constants and nuclear properties .",
    "a progress of theory is required if one intends to separate nuclear and qed effects in order to determine the nuclear parameters ( like e.g. the proton charge radius ) .",
    "it is also needed to improve the accuracy of the fundamental constants obtained this way ( like the rydberg constant , the fine structure constant @xmath2 etc . ) .",
    "presently qed calculations have some essential problems to be solved .",
    "those are related to the bound - state effects of atomic states .",
    "theory involves a number of small parameters such as the fine structure constant @xmath2 , the coulomb strength @xmath3 , the electron - to - nucleus mass ratio @xmath4 etc . because of that no calculation can be exact and some effective expansion over small parameters is involved .",
    "higher order corrections become more and more complicated and at any time there are some which can not be calculated because of their complicated analytic structure , huge amount of diagrams , numerous lengthy computations etc . that faces the basic problem of real qed ,",
    "_ how to estimate the corrections we can not calculate ?",
    "_ the problem exists for both qed of a free particle and the bound state qed .",
    "however , in the case of the bound state problem the expansion over @xmath3 and @xmath4 is not analytic and involves large logarithmic factors and big numerical coefficients .",
    "the front line of the today calculations is the study of three kinds of corrections :    * the higher - order two - loop corrections of order @xmath5 crucial for theory of the hydrogen lamb shift ; * radiative - recoil corrections of order @xmath6 which are critical contributions to the muonium hyperfine structure ( hfs ) ; * pure recoil corrections of order @xmath7 which are to be calculated to improve the accuracy of the muonium hfs .    since for most of simple atoms",
    "any precision test of the bound state of qed involves numerous effects beyond qed , it should be of great interest to develop some test which will be related to a pure qed quantity .",
    "positronium is one of very few atoms which offer such an opportunity .",
    "few features of positronium make it a very useful system to test the bound state qed .",
    "like muonium , it is a pure leptonic atom with no nuclear structure .",
    "however , in contrast to muonium , the electron - to - nucleus mass ratio is unity and that allows to study accurately higher order recoil effects performing relatively low accuracy experiments .",
    "e.g. a study of the recoil contributions to the positronium hfs in order @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the same precision as for muonium ( @xmath8 ) requires a fractional accuracy two orders of magnitudes below that for muonium .",
    "the relatively low accuracy offers a possibility to perform all calculations and measurements at the level above 1 ppm and to separate qed problems from a problem of the determination of the fine structure constant .",
    "the latter is related to the level of accuracy significantly below 1 ppm .",
    "absence of any serious problems with the accurate determination of fundamental constants is a significant advantage of positronium studies .",
    "one further advantage is a great variety of quantities which can in principle be investigated with high accuracy .",
    "a number of spectral values can be measured ( @xmath9 interval , fine structure at @xmath10 and @xmath11 hfs and some others ) and they are _ not sensitive _ to any new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "that is a direct result of the lightness of the nuclear mass ( positronium mass ) which does not allow any high momentum in any virtual effects .",
    "however , physics beyond the standard model can be studied within non - spectral experiments with positronium , particularly in the case of exotic decay modes .",
    "a possibility to clearly separate quantities insensitive and possibly sensitive to the new physics is another advantage of the positronium studies .",
    "about ten years ago the experimental accuracy was essentially better than the theoretical one for most of the quantities under study .",
    "the last decade delivered a great theoretical improvement .",
    "we have collected most of important theoretical references in table  [ psref ] and will briefly describe the recent progress in this section . in the case of the positronium spectrum",
    "the critical contributions to the @xmath11 hfs and to the @xmath9 interval are of the order @xmath12 and their calculation was completed some years ago .",
    "some results were obtained numerically and later improved by analytic calculations ( see e.g. refs .",
    ". however , minor shifts ( even equal to few standard deviations of the numerical integration ) did not affect the final results because considerably higher uncertainty arose because of another effect related to uncalculated higher - order terms .",
    "it was an exception related to the so called pure recoil spin - dependent @xmath12 contribution , calculated by several authors with contradicting results .",
    "the later analytic calculations @xcite confirmed the numerical result from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".[psref ] references to recent progress in positronium theory .",
    "the contributions to the spectrum are classified by the electron mass , while those to the decay are presented in units of the leading contribution @xmath13 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     development of the bound state qed is also fruitful for a better understanding of hadronic systems , like deuteron ( proton - neutron system ) and mesons ( quark - antiquark systems ) . in both cases",
    "a consideration of the @xmath4 value close to unity is of particular interest .",
    "successful development of theory during the last decade has made it more accurate than the experiment and we hope that some progress from the experimental side will come .",
    "that is in particular related to the fine structure at @xmath10 ."
