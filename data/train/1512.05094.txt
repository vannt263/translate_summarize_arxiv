    "the mumford - shah functional @xmath5 was introduced by david mumford and jayant shah in @xcite in the context of image processing problems .",
    "the idea is to find @xmath6 as the `` piecewise smooth '' approximation of the given raw image data @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate the regularity of the free discontinuity set of minimizers to the following simplified version of the mumford - shah functional @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a given set , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath2 is a one dimensional set that is not apriori determined . in particular , minimizing ( [ mumfordshah ] ) involves finding a pair @xmath0 where the function @xmath6 is allowed to be discontinuous across @xmath2 but the set @xmath2 can not have too large one dimensional hausdorff measure @xmath12 .",
    "it is the balance between the bulk energy @xmath13 and the surface energy @xmath12 that makes the problem interesting and challenging .",
    "we will call the set @xmath2 the free discontinuity set .",
    "notice that the absence of the term with the image data requires imposing boundary conditions .",
    "it is also important to notice that the concept of the competing bulk and surface energies goes back to british engineer alan  arnold griffith ( see @xcite ) whose theory of brittle fracture is based on the balance between gain in surface energy and strain energy release .",
    "our results are more relevant for this interpretation of the minimizers rather than to image processing .    the existence and regularity of the mumford - shah minimizers started by pioneering works of ennio de georgi , michele carriero , antonio leaci , luigi ambrosio , guy david , alexis bonnet , nicola fusco and diego pallara ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the known results can be found in the following two monographs @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we would also like to mention some recent publications , such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the regularity analysis near the crack - tip is of particular difficulty and interest , since the crack - tip is the only singularity where the bulk energy and the surface energy in a ball @xmath14 scale of the same order as @xmath15 . as a result one can not exploit",
    "the domination of the surface term over the bulk term , and the methods known from the theory of minimal surfaces does not apply .    in the paper we apply linearization techniques to derive the full asymptotic of both",
    ", analytic and geometric , components of the minimizers near the crack - tip .",
    "these classical techniques has been recently successfully exploited by the first author , henrik shahgholian and georg weiss in regularity analysis of several free boundary problems ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in sections",
    "[ sec : lin ] and [ sec : analysislin ] we adapt those free boundary theory methods to free discontinuity context .",
    "the exact asymptotic of the minimizers allow to carry out variations of the discontinuity set in the orthogonal direction near the crack - tip and derive a new , previously unknown , euler - lagrange condition for the mumford - shah functional in section [ orthvarsec ] .",
    "we believe that our results are of significant importance for the regularity analysis of the quasi - static crack - propagation model of gilles a. francfort and jean - jacques marigo ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in section [ sec : backg ] we briefly discuss this .    in the next subsection",
    "we will describe , in more detail , the problem setting . then we will briefly summarize background and the relevant known results for the mumford - shah problem .",
    "we end the introduction with stating our main results .",
    "the mumford - shah problem consists in finding the pair @xmath16 that minimizes the energy ( [ mumfordshah ] ) with some prescribed boundary values @xmath17 on @xmath18 . in general , the set @xmath2",
    "can be very complicated ( disconnected etc . ) as in the left figure below .",
    "* figure 1 : * the geometry of a blow - up .",
    "it has been shown ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) that the free discontinuity set @xmath19 is a @xmath20graph in some coordinate system around @xmath21almost every point @xmath22 .",
    "it is also known that certain singularities exists @xcite such as _ spider points _ , consisting of three arcs meeting at @xmath23 angles in a point , or crack - tips , points where the free discontinuity set @xmath19 ends at some point .",
    "the right figure above shows a typical crack - tip .",
    "not much is known about the regularity properties of the free discontinuity set close to the crack - tip . in particular , it is not known if the free discontinuity set can spiral around a crack - tip point infinitely many times or if the blow - up of the solution is unique at the crack - tip . our main goal is to analyze the behavior of @xmath19 close to a crack - tip . in this article",
    "we will provide an analysis of the crack - tip and exclude spiraling behaviors as well as providing good regularity estimates at the crack - tip .    in order to specify what we mean",
    "by a crack - tip we make the following definition .",
    "[ epsclosedef ] we say that @xmath0 is @xmath24close to a crack - tip if the following holds :    1 .   [ someshit ] @xmath0 is a minimizer of ( [ mumfordshah ] ) in @xmath25 with some specified boundary conditions .",
    "[ connectedcurve ] @xmath2 consists of a connected rectifiable curve that connects the origin to @xmath3 .",
    "[ branchcut ] and for some @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the standard polar coordinates of @xmath29 .",
    "4 .   @xmath30 .",
    "let us briefly indicate the this definition is not vacuous and that solutions that are @xmath24close to a crack - tip indeed do exist .",
    "it is not absolutely clear what is to be considered to be the right class of minimizers . in @xcite l. ambrosio",
    "showed existence of minimizers in the space of special functions of bounded variation sbv , in that case the free discontinuity set @xmath19 is considered to be the singular support of the measure @xmath31 .",
    "dal maso , morel and solimini @xcite showed existence of minimizers under the restriction that @xmath19 should consist of at most @xmath32 components .",
    "in @xcite it was also showed that the minimizer with @xmath33 consisting of at most @xmath32 components will converge to the general minimizer as @xmath34 , see @xcite for exact statements and details . in any case , the existence of minimizers are already well established .",
    "for definiteness we can think of minimizers in the sense of @xcite .    to see that the assumption [ connectedcurve ] in definition [ epsclosedef ] is not very restrictive we consider a minimizer constructed in @xcite with @xmath19 consisting of a finite number of components .",
    "then if @xmath35 is at a crack - tip we may find a small ball @xmath36 such that @xmath19 connects @xmath37 to @xmath35 and @xmath38 consists of one component .",
    "we may then define @xmath39 by scaling invariance of the functional @xmath40 is a minimizer in @xmath41 ; thus @xmath40 satisfies [ someshit ] of definition [ epsclosedef ] .",
    "also , since @xmath19 have finitely many components , @xmath19 will satisfy [ connectedcurve ] of definition [ epsclosedef ] if @xmath42 is small enough .",
    "the geometry of the situation is indicated in in figure 1 where we have tried to depict that in a small ball around a crack - tip the free discontinuity set is a curve connecting the origin to the boundary .",
    "the right picture in figure 1 shows the free discontinuity set of the rescaled function @xmath40 .",
    "if we let @xmath42 be small enough in ( [ rescaled ] ) then [ branchcut ] will be satisfied by @xmath40 ; this was shown in @xcite . in [ branchcut ] of definition [ epsclosedef ] , as well as later in this article , we place the branch - cut of @xmath43 along @xmath19 .    since it is well known that minimizers of the mumford - shah functional are @xmath44 the final assumption in definition [ epsclosedef ] can be achieved by adding a constant to @xmath6 .",
    "it is therefore clear that we can construct minimizers @xmath16 , as in @xcite , such that up to a rescaling , as in ( [ rescaled ] ) , and an additive constant the solution is @xmath24close to a crack - tip at every end point of the set @xmath19 .",
    "whether the same is true for the more general class of sbv - minimizers considered in @xcite is as far as we know an open question .",
    "we will not consider that question here .",
    "* variations : * before we continue we need to talk about variations and euler - lagrange equations .",
    "we have talked about two kinds of minimizers , and for definiteness mentioned that we are interested in the minimizers where @xmath19 has finitely many components . in practice",
    "we are interested in any kind of minimizer that is @xmath24close to a crack - tip that satisfies the three types of variations that we will discuss presently .",
    "the first type of variations are variations in @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath16 be a minimizer in @xmath45 and let @xmath46 .",
    "then for any function @xmath47 such that @xmath48 on @xmath49 we have that @xmath50 is a competitor for minimality in the subset @xmath51 .",
    "extending @xmath52 by zero in @xmath45 we can calculate @xmath53 thus minimizers @xmath6 satisfy a neumann boundary condition on @xmath2 .",
    "the second type of variations are the domain variations .",
    "these variations we will only do away form the crack - tip . for any function @xmath54 with compact support",
    "it follows that @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a competitor for minimality .",
    "a standard calculation , @xcite , leads to @xmath57dx-\\ ] ] @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the tangential divergence on @xmath19 . for us ,",
    "the most important situation will be when @xmath19 is a graph of a @xmath60 function on the support of @xmath61 . if @xmath62 and @xmath63 then @xmath64 choosing @xmath65 and converting the volume integral in ( [ domvar ] ) to a boundary integral by means of an integration by parts , assuming that everything is smooth , shows that @xmath66 where @xmath67 indicates weather we consider the values of @xmath68 on the upper or lower part of @xmath19 , see @xcite .",
    "we interpret that as @xmath69^\\pm\\ ] ] in a weak sense where @xmath70^\\pm=|\\nabla u(x_1,f(x_1)^+)|^2-|\\nabla u(x_1,f(x_1)^-)|^2.\\ ] ]    the final type of variation we will do is to change the position of the crack - tip .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 is @xmath24close to a crack - tip - this includes the assumptions that the crack - tip of @xmath16 is located at the origin and that @xmath16 is a minimizer . by minimality",
    "it follows that @xmath71 for any pair @xmath72 where @xmath73 is some arc in @xmath74 and the crack tip of @xmath73 is at some point @xmath75 .",
    "this third type of variation has previously been done in the tangential direction of the crack .",
    "we will do such tangential variations of the crack - tip in section [ prelestsec ] .",
    "in section [ orthvarsec ] we will make comparisons with functions that has the crack - tip slightly moved in the in the direction orthogonal the crack - tip , see the right figure below .",
    "these variations are , to our knowledge , entirely new and needed to show that the curvature vanishes at the crack - tip .",
    "these variations require much calculation but are in principle trivial once one has good enough asymptotic information about the solution in a neighborhood of the crack - tip .",
    "* figure 2 . * _ in the `` tangential variations '' of the crack - tip we extend the crack as in the left picture . in the `` orthogonal varations '' of the crack - tip",
    "we compare the energy of the crack to the energy of a crack that has the crack - tip moved slightly in the orthogonal direction of the crack tip .",
    "this is shown in the right picture with the comparison crack represented by the dashed line . _      in this sub - section we gather some known results and also try to situate the present research within the field .",
    "as was already remarked the question of existence of minimizers is already established in different settings @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the next step is usually to prove that the minimizer is more regular that the generic function in the space we minimize in .",
    "for the mumford - shah problem this means to show two things , that the minimizing function @xmath6 is continuous in @xmath76 and that the free discontinuity set @xmath19 is smooth ( except at some controllable set of singular points ) .",
    "the more important , and difficult , problem is to establish that @xmath19 is smooth .",
    "a typical result in this direction is .",
    "[ ambrosio ] there exists a @xmath77 such that if @xmath0 be a minimizing pair of the mumford - shah functional and , for some @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 then @xmath81 is a @xmath82graph , of a function @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 for some constant @xmath86 .",
    "this theorem is a slightly weaker version of the regularity result in @xcite and is close to the state of the art regularity theory for the mumford - shah problem in @xmath29 .",
    "the authors of @xcite shows a stronger result in @xmath87 , but the above theorem is good enough for our purposes , and easier to formulate .",
    "the first thing to notice about theorem [ ambrosio ] is that the condition ( [ nablausmall ] ) excludes the crack - tip .",
    "the conclusion of the theorem includes the statement that @xmath88 is disconnected which is nt true for the crack - tip .",
    "the problem is that at a crack - tip @xmath35 @xmath89 as @xmath15 through some sub - sequence .",
    "this means that , for small @xmath42 , @xmath40 will not satisfy ( [ nablausmall ] ) for small @xmath90 .",
    "we would like to remark that the constant @xmath91 in the limit solution in ( [ ivarwouldknow ] ) expresses the right balance between the surface and dirichlet energy in the functional and is uniquely determined by the functional , see lemma [ variationsintang ] .",
    "also the estimate ( [ nastyyrhs ] ) is not good enough to analyze points close to the crack - tip .",
    "in particular , the right hand side in the estimate ( [ nastyyrhs ] ) includes the term @xmath90 which measures the size of @xmath92 . however , from the euler - lagrange equations ( [ pointwisecurv ] ) we know that the geometry of @xmath19 is determined by the difference @xmath93^\\pm$ ] .",
    "if we have symmetry and cancellation in @xmath93^\\pm$ ] then the curvature of @xmath19 might be very small even though @xmath92 is not smaller than @xmath90 . at the crack - tip",
    "we know that , after a rotation of the coordinate system , @xmath94 in particular , we almost have symmetry of the minimizer @xmath6 close to the crack - tip .",
    "this opens up for a more refined analysis of the regularity of @xmath19 close to the crack - tip .",
    "we will indeed use this symmetry effect in our proof - but it is hidden away after the obscure equation ( [ expressionnablapi ] ) in the middle of a long and technical calculation .",
    "there are other regularity proofs for the crack - tip in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however none of them are using the symmetry close to the crack tip and their proofs does not include the regularity of the free discontinuity sets up to the crack - tip .",
    "let us finish this introduction by remarking that the regularity of the crack - tip is a very important question for questions relating to crack - propagation in the applied sciences .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed existence of solutions for griffith s model of quasi - static propagation in brittle materials .",
    "the models involve minimizing @xmath95 for each time @xmath96 $ ] where @xmath97 on @xmath18 and under the extra constraint @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "their method of analysis is by time discretization .",
    "that is , they minimize the problem at discrete times @xmath100 and find solutions to the mumford - shah problem @xmath101 with the extra condition @xmath102 . by sending @xmath103",
    "they recover a solution to the original problem . in order to analyze this time discretized problem we need to analyze the set free discontinuity set @xmath104 for each @xmath32 .",
    "but if @xmath105 is small then the set @xmath104 will be close to a crack - tip .",
    "it will , in particular , be of great importance to be able to make variations _",
    "`` in the orthogonal direction '' _ as we do in section [ orthvarsec ] in order to analyze the growth of a fracture .",
    "we plan to address this problem in a future article .",
    "this article has two main results and one technical development , which is strongly related to these results .",
    "the first main result is    [ mainresult1 ] there exists an @xmath106 and a constant @xmath107 such that for every @xmath108 there exists a constant @xmath109 , depending on @xmath110 but not on @xmath111 , such that if @xmath16 is @xmath24close to a crack - tip for some @xmath112 then , after possibly rotating the coordinate system @xmath113    this will be restated as corollary [ c1alpharegularity ] in section [ c1alphasec ] .",
    "we interpret this as a point - wise @xmath114 result at the crack - tip . to actually show that @xmath2 is",
    "a @xmath114 manifold up to the crack - tip would require an argument , similar to the argument in @xcite or the main argument here , taking the symmetry into consideration at points close to the crack - tip .",
    "we do not expect any difficulties in proving such a result .",
    "however , that would add to the length of an already long and technical paper .",
    "we also believe that the point - wise regularity at the crack - tip , and the techniques leading up to this result , is of greater importance in order to analyze the quasi - static crack growth .",
    "the proof of the first main result consists of linearizing the euler - lagrange equations close to a crack - tip .",
    "solutions of the linearized equations can be expressed as a series of homogeneous solutions .",
    "the possible homogeneities of the solutions are given by solutions @xmath115 of the following equation @xmath116 a standard flatness improvement argument shows that the solutions of the euler - lagrange equations are almost as regular as the least regular homogeneous solution of the linearized problem .",
    "the point - wise @xmath114 regularity in main result [ mainresult1 ] can not be improved upon without making variations of the crack - tip in the @xmath117-direction .",
    "one of the main steps in proving main result [ mainresult1 ] is to determine the asymptotic expansion of the linearized euler - lagrange equations at the crack - tip , see lemma [ improvedlinearization ] . using this explicit expression for the linearized equations we are able to make variations of the crack - tip in the @xmath118direction and derive our second main result .",
    "this is done by explicit calculation in section [ orthvarsec ] .",

    "this last condition is new and dependent on the new variations of the crack - tip in the @xmath118direction . in particular , by making a variation of the crack - tip in the @xmath118direction one can show that the first term in the homogeneous expansion of the limit function in a linearization process will be zero .",
