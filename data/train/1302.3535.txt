    "due to quantum fluctuations of the positions of the nucleons inside the colliding nuclei , and of the positions of the colored quark and gluon constituents inside each nucleon , the density of the fireball matter created in collisions between ultra - relativistic heavy ions is highly inhomogeneous in the plane transverse to the beam direction and fluctuates from event to event , even for collisions with identical impact parameters .",
    "experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite and their theoretical interpretation have established that this matter quickly thermalizes into a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "the initial density inhomogeneities lead to highly anisotropic pressure gradients , causing an anisotropic collective expansion of the fireball whose harmonic flow coefficients @xmath0 and associated flow angles @xmath1 ( both defined below ) fluctuate from collision to collision @xcite .",
    "while @xmath0 fluctuations and the effect of their variance on different methods for measuring @xmath0 have been studied extensively over the last few years ( for recent reviews and references to the original literature see @xcite ) , flow angle fluctuations and correlations have only recently found attention @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that , since the fluctuating flow angles @xmath1 depend on transverse momentum @xmath2 and rapidity @xmath3 , the usually assumed ( and experimentally observed @xcite ) factorization of the azimuthal oscillation amplitudes of the two - particle angular correlations into a product of single - particle flow coefficients is slightly broken even if these correlations are entirely due to collective flow .",
    "we show here that the @xmath2-dependence and fluctuating nature of the flow angles @xmath1 also affects the @xmath2-dependence of the experimentally measured differential flow coefficients @xmath4 , and that it does so in different ways for different experimental methods of determining @xmath4 .         for each collision event the momentum distribution of finally emitted particles",
    "can be characterized by a set of harmonic flow coefficients @xmath0 and flow angles @xmath1 through the complex quantities @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the azimuthal angle around the beam direction of the particle s transverse momentum @xmath7 , and the curly brackets denote the average over particles from a single collision .",
    "eq.([eq1 ] ) defines the flow coefficients and associated flow angles for the entire event , whereas eq.([eq2 ] ) is the analogous definition for the subset of particles in the event with a given magnitude of the transverse momentum @xmath8 .",
    "we suppress the dependence of both types of flow coefficients on the rapidity @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath0 are known as the `` integrated '' anisotropic flows , @xmath9 are called `` differential '' flows . by definition ,",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath9 are positive definite .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations show that in general the flow angles @xmath1 depend on @xmath8 , and that , as a function of @xmath8 , @xmath10 wanders around the `` average angle '' @xmath1 that characterizes the integrated flow @xmath0 of the entire event ( see fig.[f1 ] below and also fig.2 in ref .",
    "some theoretical and experimental definitions of @xmath11 have yielded values that turn negative over certain @xmath8 ranges ; we will see that this is due to defining the flows of each event relative to a fixed azimuthal angle ( for example , relative to the direction of the impact parameter of the collision in theoretical calculations , or relative to the `` integrated '' elliptic flow angle @xmath12 in experiment ) , and that the same thing can happen for higher order harmonic flow coefficients when defining them relative to a fixed ( i.e. @xmath8-independent ) flow angle @xmath1 .",
    "the subject of this paper is to elucidate the origins of such differences between different anisotropic flow measures and , in particular , the manifestation of event - by - event fluctuations of the @xmath8-dependent flow coefficients @xmath9 and flow angles @xmath10 in different experimental flow measures .",
    "the key experimental difficulty is that , due to the finite number of particles emitted in a each collision , the left hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1],[eq2 ] ) can not be determined accurately for a single event .",
    "the @xmath13 are characterized by probability distributions that depend on the studied class of events ( system size , collision energy and centrality ) from which each collision takes a sample .",
    "experimental flow measurements rely on a number of different methods that amount to taking different moments of that probability distribution , by averaging over large numbers of events . understanding the nature of these moments and reconstructing them from theoretical event - by - event dynamical simulations are essential steps in a meaningful comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "our main interest lies in the event - by - event fluctuations in the initial state of the collision fireball .",
    "these are primarily caused by the finite number of nucleons ( or effective collision centers ) in the colliding nuclei and unrelated to detector capabilities .",
    "in addition , there are fluctuations related to the finite number of particles produced ( or detected ) in the event which depend on collision energy and ( in part ) on detector capabilities .",
    "they reflect the fact that in practice the final state of the fireball evolution , which in principle ( with the appropriate dynamical evolution model ) can be _ predicted _ from the initial state with perfect precision , can not be _ measured _ with perfect precision , due to finite sampling statistics . in this paper",
    "we are not interested in the fluctuations arising from finite sampling statistics .",
    "the consequences of finite number statistical effects in a single event on the new observables proposed in this paper deserve a careful investigation that we leave for the future . here",
    "we focus on the hydrodynamical consequences of unavoidable event - by - event fluctuations in the initial state over which we have no control since they are rooted in the internal structure of the colliding nuclei , and with which we therefore have to live in any case even after we correct the measurements for finite final state multiplicity effects .",
    "the most extensively used experimental methods for measuring anisotropic flows are the event - plane and two - particle correlation methods @xcite .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the latter .",
    "two - particle azimuthal correlations receive contributions from the anisotropic collective flow as well as from non - flow correlations ; the latter can be minimized by appropriate experimental cuts and corrected for @xcite .",
    "again , we are not interested in non - flow correlations and will here simply ignore their existence , assuming that they have been corrected for in the experimental analysis .",
    "two - particle correlation measures of anisotropic flow are based on correlators of the type @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the azimuthal angles around the beam direction of two particles with transverse momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denotes the average over @xmath20 events from a set of given characteristics ( e.g. of collisions in a certain centrality bin ) , @xmath21 whereas @xmath22 is the average of the observable @xmath23 over all ( or a specified subset of all ) particle pairs in the event @xmath24 : @xmath25 different chosen subsets for the event - wise average @xmath22 define different correlation measures for the anisotropic flow coefficients as we will explain below .",
