    "recently mos@xmath0-based layered transition metal chalcogenides ( ltmds ) have attracted considerable attention due to their potential for constructing low dimensional nano - structures for a variety of applications  @xcite .",
    "the electronic properties of mos@xmath0 show a strong dependence on thickness  @xcite , i.e. on the number of atomic layers forming a given sample . in particular , mos@xmath0 monolayers , which display a substantial direct band - gap ,",
    "represent a semiconducting alternative to graphene , which is a metal in its pristine form .",
    "although the band - gap of graphene can be opened by fabricating nanoribbons  @xcite or by depositing it on a suitable substrate  @xcite , this comes to the prize of deteriorating , in a somehow uncontrollable way , the carrier mobility due to edges and impurity scattering  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the low dimensionality , the small amount of dangling bonds , and their typical high crystalline form , make the performances of ltmd - based transistors comparable to those of existing si - based ones  @xcite . in particular transistors made from mos@xmath0 monolayers have been recently fabricated , showing a mobility of at least 200  @xmath3/v@xmath4s at room temperature , an on / off current ratio of 10@xmath5 and low standby power dissipation  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , both @xmath1-type  @xcite and @xmath2-type  @xcite conductivities have been reported in ultra - thin mos@xmath0 layers deposited on sio@xmath0 .",
    "the conducting behavior of mos@xmath0 therefore seems to depend on the experimental details and an explanation for the specific current polarity ( @xmath1- or @xmath2-type ) remains far from being clear .",
    "note that no intentional doping was introduced in the experiments mentioned above , so that the source of the different carrier types should be intrinsic to the mos@xmath0 layer , to the substrate and to the interaction between the two .",
    "the possible creation of mo and/or s vacancies during the growth can not be the cause of the various conductive properties , since vacancies create deep levels at mid - gap in the bandstructure of mos@xmath0 monolayers @xcite .",
    "notably , disorder at the semiconductor / substrate interface in general plays a crucial role in determining the conductive properties of ultra - thin devices .",
    "for example , for gaas nanowires it has been demonstrated that upon decreasing the nanowire diameter the interface - mediated conductivity gradually becomes dominant over the bulk one  @xcite .",
    "such surface sensitivity can also be used to one s advantage .",
    "for instance an ambipolar transistor has been realized in mos@xmath0 thin flakes by contact with a ionic liquid environment  @xcite , which as well affects the interface properties . since mos@xmath0 monolayers are placed on insulators in practically any device architecture , it is important to identify the possible effects that the substrate has on the conductivity .",
    "the defects responsible for the conductive properties of low dimensional devices are expected to be extrinsic in nature , such as charged impurities at the interface between the conductive channel and the substrate .",
    "these lead to an inhomogeneous coulomb potential for both conduction and valence band electrons .",
    "such charge traps have been identified to be in the form of adsorbates or defects at the surface of the underlying substrate in the case of graphene  @xcite .",
    "likewise , temperature dependent transport measurements on thin mos@xmath0 layers , down to the monolayer limit , suggest that trapped charges at the sio@xmath0 surface could be responsible for the observed @xmath1-type behavior , when mos@xmath0 is deposited on sio@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in general when charged traps are located at an interface , they influence the depletion / accumulation of electrons in the conducting channel up to a certain thickness , which is proportional to the channel screening length .",
    "this distance depends on different physical features , such as the nature and the density of the traps , and the electronic properties of the channel . for conventional semiconductors it typically reaches up to a few nanometers . for instance it has been recently demonstrated that charged trap states at the substrate / channel interface significantly affect the conductivity of gaas nanowires up to diameters of about 40 - 70  nm @xcite .",
    "more dramatic effects are expected for layered compounds down to the single layer limit , in which essentially all the atoms are at the interface with the substrate and the channel vertical dimension is certainly shorter than the screening length . recently",
    "a reduction in conductivity with increasing the mos@xmath0 film thickness has been observed in mos@xmath0-based transistors , where sio@xmath0 was used as back gate @xcite .",
    "this suggests that for the mos@xmath0/sio@xmath0 system the transport is interface - mediated , as intrinsic defects , homogeneously distributed in mos@xmath0 , would not lead to any dependence of the conductivity on thickness .    in order to shed some light on the effects that trap states at the sio@xmath0 surface have on the conductive properties of mos@xmath0/sio@xmath0 hybrid systems ,",
    "we have performed state of the art first principle electronic structure calculations .",
    "in particular we have considered the case when the traps are due to impurities such as immobile na and h atoms , and o - dangling bonds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly describe our computational techniques and we provide details of the simulations performed",
    ". then we proceed with presenting the results of this work in the context of recent experiments , and finally we conclude .",
    "in order to investigate the influence of a sio@xmath0 substrate on the electronic properties of a mos@xmath0 monolayer , _ ab - initio _ calculations are performed by using density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of the exchange and correlation ( xc ) functional as introduced by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite and numerically implemented in the siesta code @xcite . in our calculations , a double-@xmath6 polarized  @xcite numerical atomic orbital basis set is used for all the atoms and the troullier - martins scheme is employed for constructing norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite .",
    "an equivalent plane wave cutoff of 350  ry is chosen in all the simulations and the brillouin zone is sampled by using an equivalent @xmath7-grid cutoff of 17   .",
    "relaxed geometries are obtained with the conjugate gradient method , where all the atoms in the supercell are allowed to relax until the force on each atom is less than 0.02  ev /  .",
    "a trap state is usually formed when an energy level associated either to a defect or an impurity appears within the energy gap of the host material .",
    "such trap states influence the charge transport properties mainly in two ways .",
    "firstly , if the traps are charged , they will capture a hole or an electron from the environment .",
    "this produces a modification of the electrostatic potential , which in turns shifts the level alignments in the system , and thus affects the conductivity .",
    "secondly , they can also increase the carrier concentration and provide pathways for electrons or holes to hop .",
    "the efficiency of this process depends on the amount of localization of the states associated to the defect site .",
    "if the energy of the localized gap state is close to either the valence band maximum ( vbm ) or the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) , then at a given temperature some of these charges will be transferred either to the conduction or to the valence band , where they may contribute to increase the system conductivity .",
    "whether or not one can describe with _ ab initio _ calculations such mechanisms depends crucially on the ability of computing accurately the energy levels of the system .",
    "the use of the gga ( or of the local density approximation - lda ) for electronic structure calculations of defect levels is , in general , problematic .",
    "one reason is the typical underestimation of the energy gap and the related incorrect alignment of the energy levels of hybrid systems .",
    "for instance an artificially reduced band - gap may erroneously bring deep traps in resonance with either the conduction or the valence band  @xcite .",
    "a second source of error is the incorrect description of the charge localization at the defect site , a feature that usually leads to predict defects to be too shallow  @xcite .",
    "atomic self - interaction correction ( asic )  @xcite has been proved to overcome these deficiencies  @xcite .",
    "therefore we also perform additional lda+asic calculations to verify the robustness of the lda / gga results .",
    "in particular we set the asic scaling parameter to @xmath8 , a value which is generally appropriate to mid - gap insulators  @xcite .",
    "substantial experimental efforts have been devoted to deposit ultra - thin mos@xmath0 layers onto sio@xmath0 in order to demonstrate transistor operation , down to the single layer limit  @xcite . usually amorphous oxides are used as substrates . however , in order to avoid the computational complexity of a highly disordered structure , a crystalline sio@xmath0 substrate is simulated here instead .",
    "this also allows us to systematically determine the effects of individual defects and impurities on the electronic structure of a mos@xmath0 layer .",
    "our unit cell is constructed as a slab containing at least 6 si atomic layers of @xmath9-quartz and an adsorbed mos@xmath0 monolayer .",
    "at least 15    of vacuum are included at the slab boundaries to avoid the spurious interaction between the slab periodic images .",
    "we consider the modified oxygen - terminated ( 0001 ) sio@xmath0 surface in order to simulate the most experimentally relevant conditions .    two primary structures for the oxygen - terminated sio@xmath0 ( 0001 ) surface are possible , depending on whether the termination is with the siloxane group ( si - o - si ) or with the silanol one ( si - oh )",
    ". both surfaces can form depending on the surface treatment  @xcite .",
    "the siloxane reconstruction at room temperature forms an o - terminated surface with an outermost six - membered ring structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sio2](a , b ) .",
    "under annealing in ambient conditions it becomes hydroxylated ( si - oh ) and the reconstruction transforms into the silanol one , which presents on the surface a zigzag h - bonded network [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : sio2](c , d ) ] . in both cases in our simulations the dangling bonds on the si - terminated bottom surface are saturated by hydrogen .",
    "the optimized lattice constants of the pristine sio@xmath0 and mos@xmath0 are 4.91    and 3.19   , respectively .",
    "we therefore construct a hexagonal supercell in the plane , with a 9.69   - long side , so that the lattice mismatch between sio@xmath0 and mos@xmath0 is minimized to @xmath101.2  % .",
    "the gga calculated band - gap of sio@xmath0 and of a mos@xmath0 monolayer are 6.20  ev and 1.49  ev , respectively .",
    "the small strain applied to the mos@xmath0 monolayer changes only little the electronic structure .",
    "the band - gap remains direct at the k point and it is only reduced by 0.22  ev from the value of 1.71  ev obtained for the unstrained case . similarly to the case of graphene @xcite , we expect that the electronic structure of a mos@xmath0 monolayer is only marginally affected by its local arrangement on the sio@xmath0 substrate .",
    "therefore , as a representative configuration we use the arrangement of fig .",

    "the equilibrium distances , @xmath12 , between the sio@xmath0 and the mos@xmath0 surfaces are 3.01    and 2.98    for siloxane and silanol ,  respectively . here",
    "@xmath12 is defined as the vertical separation between the top - most o layer in the sio@xmath0 surface and its nearest s layer in mos@xmath0 .",
    "these values are similar to the distance between two mos@xmath0 monolayers that we calculate to be 3.17   .",
    "the binding energy of the mos@xmath0/sio@xmath0 system is given by @xmath13 = @xmath14 + @xmath15 - @xmath16 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are total energies of the isolated mos@xmath0 , the isolated sio@xmath0 slab , and of the mos@xmath0/sio@xmath0 hybrid system , respectively .",
    "we find @xmath13 for siloxane and silanol to be respectively 0.14  ev and 0.16  ev per primitive mos@xmath0 unit cell .",
    "these binding energies are close to that between two mos@xmath0 layers ( 0.20 ev / unit cell ) , which are bound together by the rather weak van der waals forces . as such ,",
    "our results show that mos@xmath0 is weakly bound also to the sio@xmath0 surface , in agreement with recent experimental results that have measured the interaction between mos@xmath0 and an underlying sio@xmath0 substrate to be negligible  @xcite .",
    "note that in general gga - type xc - functionals do not describe accurately van der waals forces .",
    "however , it has been shown that the lda / gga is able to reproduce the interlayer spacing and the binding energy of layered chalcogenides  @xcite .",
    "we have then verified that our calculated @xmath12 for bulk mos@xmath0 , @xmath17   , is in good agreement with the experimental value of 2.96    @xcite and also with the previously calculated theoretical estimate of 3.05    @xcite . moreover , in order to take into account possible small deviations of the relaxed distance from the experimental value due to the xc functional used , we have evaluated the electronic structure for @xmath12 within the range @xmath180.5   , and we have found that the results change little with varying the distance .",

    "we note that the projected dos ( pdos ) over mos@xmath0 extends into the sio@xmath0 band - gap , and the total dos of the combined material is essentially given by the superposition of the doss of the pristine slab of sio@xmath0 [ fig .",

    "importantly , one of the basic criteria for the selection of the gate oxide is fulfilled here , namely that the oxide should have a bands offset of over 1  ev for both the conduction and valence band in order to create a large barrier for both electrons and holes  @xcite .",
    "our results show that the conductivity of mos@xmath0 is not influenced by the underlying defect - free sio@xmath0 substrate .",
    "therefore the measured @xmath1-type or @xmath2-type conducting properties of mos@xmath0 on sio@xmath0 must be due to defects and impurities .",

    "[ fig : schematic ] .",

    "therefore , such trap states are expected to give significant contributions to the conductivity of these low dimensional systems . in the layered structure",
    "considered in this work , the trap states are expected to be located at the interface between the ltmds and the substrate , not in the ltmds themselves , which usually are highly defect - free .",

    "note that such state is singly occupied and therefore spin - splits in our spin - polarized calculations , with the empty minority spin state ( spin down ) laying approximately 1  ev below the cbm and 1  ev below the fermi level .",
    "when a mos@xmath0 monolayer is deposited over the the na - doped sio@xmath0 surface , @xmath12 increases to 3.24    at the edges of our unit cell , whereas at the na site the o - s distance becomes 3.45   .",
    "the enlargement of the binding distance compared to that of the pristine sio@xmath0/mos@xmath0 system is a direct consequence of the na intercalation at the interface .",

    "the resulting dos around @xmath29 is thus that of the defect - free mos@xmath0 conduction band with the addition of a na - derived impurity level positioned below it .",
    "hence , the gap state is moved below the fermi energy , resulting in a very small activation energy for the transfer of electrons from na to the mos@xmath0 conduction band .",
    "this is the situation schematically presented in figure  [ fig : schematic](b ) , which leads to @xmath1-doping .",
    "if we now replace na with h on the sio@xmath0 siloxane surface , the associated filled gap state lies deep in the sio@xmath0 band - gap [ see fig .  [",

    "similarly the o dangling bond on the silanol - terminated surface leads to a @xmath2-type semiconducting character [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : sic](b ) ] , with the fermi energy positioned below the mos@xmath0 valence band .",
    "this indicates that our two main results remain unchanged whether calculated at the gga or asic level , i.e. they are robust with respect to the choice of exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the effects of the sio@xmath0 substrate on the conductivity of a semiconducting mos@xmath0 monolayer are investigated with first principles density functional theory calculations .",
    "the defect - free sio@xmath0 surface does not affect significantly the electronic properties of mos@xmath0 due to their weak mutual interaction .",
    "as such the conductive properties of mos@xmath0 do not change and sio@xmath0 appear as an ideal gate material .",
    "when na atoms are placed at the sio@xmath0/mos@xmath0 interface , a shallow donor trap state is created just below the cbm of the hybrid sio@xmath0/mos@xmath0 composite .",
    "the small activation energy makes the hybrid mos@xmath0/na - sio@xmath0 system a @xmath1-type semiconductor even for rather low temperatures .",
    "interestingly , the behavior is different for h adsorption , where the impurity level is created @xmath100.9 ev below the cbm , resulting in a stable localized charge that can not be easily promoted to the cbm and does therefore not affect the conductivity .",
    "in contrast , in the case of oxygen dangling bonds on the silanol - terminated sio@xmath0 surface , the fermi energy of the mos@xmath0/sio@xmath0 system is located just below the vbm , making the system a @xmath2-type semiconductor .",
    "these results shows that the conductivity of ultra - thin semiconducting ltmds changes from @xmath1-type to @xmath2-type depending on the charge - polarity of the traps , as well the energy level alignment of the trap states within the ltmds band gap .",
    "these kind of trap states at the sio@xmath0 surface are likely to be at the origin of the observed change in conductance in different experimentally realized mos@xmath0-based transistors .",
    "intriguingly , our results suggest the possibility of intentionally doping mos@xmath0 by depositing different adsorbates over the substrate sio@xmath0 surface",
    ". this can pave the way for a new strategy in the design of two - dimensional devices , where the electronic properties of the channel are engineered by manipulating those of the substrate .",
