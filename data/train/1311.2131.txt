    "current cosmological observations , such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements of temperature anisotropies and polarization at high redshift @xmath7 and the redshift - distance measurements of supernovae ( snia ) at @xmath8 , have demonstrated that the universe is now undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion .",
    "the nature of dark energy , the mysterious power to drive the expansion , is among the biggest problems in modern physics and has been studied widely .",
    "the simplest candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant , whose equation of state ( eos ) @xmath9 always remains @xmath10 .",
    "although this model is compatible with the current observational data @xcite , it suffers from the well - known fine - tuning and coincidence problems @xcite .    in order to lift these severe problems , many alternative dynamical dark energy models , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , k - essence @xcite , and quintom @xcite , have been proposed .",
    "interestingly , the dynamical dark energy component is naturally expected to interact with the other components , such as the cold dark matter @xcite or massive neutrinos @xcite , in the field theory framework .",
    "if these interactions really exist , it would open up the possibility of detecting the dark energy non - gravitationally .    in the coupled dark energy models ,",
    "the quintessence scalar field could nontrivially couple to the cold dark matter component .",
    "the presence of the interaction clearly modifies the cosmological background evolutions .",
    "the evolution of cold dark matter energy density is dependent on the quintessence scalar field @xcite .",
    "the energy density can be transferred between the cold dark matter and the dark energy . on the other hand",
    ", the interaction between dark sectors will also affect the evolution of cosmological perturbations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the non - zero coupling could shift the matter - radiation equality scale factor , and affect the locations and amplitudes of acoustic peaks of cmb temperature anisotropies and the turnover scales of large scale structure ( lss ) matter power spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the coupling affects the dynamics of the gravitational potential , and also affect the late integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to investigate the non - minimally coupled dark energy models from the current observational data , such as the cmb measurements @xcite , the lss clustering @xcite , the weak lensing @xcite , the cross - correlation between cmb and lss @xcite , and the low redshift observations @xcite .    since the planck collaboration has released the first cosmological papers providing the high resolution , full sky , cmb maps @xcite , it is important to study the coupled dark energy models and revisit the constraint on parameters from the latest cosmological probes . in this paper",
    "we investigate this kind of model and present the tight constraints from the latest planck and wmap9 data , the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) measurements from several large scale structure ( lss ) surveys , the `` union2.1 '' compilation which includes 580 supernovae , and the cmb lensing data from the planck measurement .",
    "more interestingly , we find a non - zero value for the interaction parameter from the `` snls '' supernovae sample and the direct measurement on the hubble constant from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sec.ii we show the basic equations of background evolution and linear perturbations of the coupled dark energy model . in sec.iii we present the current observational datasets we used .",
    "sec.iv contains our main global fitting results from the current observations , while sec.v is dedicated to the summary .",
    "in this section we briefly review the basic equations for the coupled dark energy model .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for a very detailed description of all equations involved and effects on the cmb and lss measurements .",
    "we assume a flat universe described by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric and the adiabatic initial conditions for all components in our analyses .",
    "when including the interactions , the conservation of energy momentum for each component becomes @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the energy - momentum tensors and @xmath13 is the quintessence scalar field . in our analysis",
    "we only consider the interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy , the energy conservation equations of cold dark matter and dark energy will be violated : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the energy densities of cold dark matter and dark energy , @xmath17 ( the dot refers to the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 is the interaction energy exchange . here , we consider the exponential form @xmath20 as the interaction form between quintessence and cold dark matter , where @xmath21 is the bare energy density of cold dark matter and @xmath0 is the strength of interaction .",
    "then , the energy exchange @xmath19 can be written as @xcite : @xmath22 when @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) , the energy of cold dark matter ( or dark energy ) transfers to dark energy ( or cold dark matter ) .",
    "equivalently , the quintessence scalar field @xmath13 evolves according to the klein - gordon equation : @xmath25 in this paper we choose the typical exponential form as the quintessence potential : @xmath26 , and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the quintessence scalar field @xmath27 : @xmath28 .",
    "we modify these background equations of the coupled dark energy model in the camb code @xcite to calculate the cosmological distance information for the snia and bao measurements .    in the synchronous gauge",
    ", we could calculate the evolution equations for the perturbation of cold dark matter in the linear regime @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the density perturbation and the gradient of the velocity of the cold dark matter , @xmath32 is the perturbation of dark energy scalar field , and @xmath33 is the usual synchronous gauge metric perturbation . in the presence of interaction ,",
    "@xmath31 will evolve to be nonzero , even if its initial value is zero .",
    "therefore , we compute the perturbation equations in an arbitrary synchronous gauge , instead of the cold dark matter rest frame @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we get the perturbed klein - gordon equation in the non - minimally coupled system : @xmath34 we include these evolution equations for the perturbations of the coupled dark energy model in the camb code to compute the theoretical prediction of the cmb temperature power spectrum .    , @xmath35 ( black solid lines ) and @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( red dashed lines ) . ]    here , we use the best fit model of planck data @xcite : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 at @xmath44 @xmath45 . in figure",
    "[ cmb_eff ] we plot the cmb temperature power spectra for two different models : the uncoupled model @xmath36 , @xmath35 ( black solid lines ) and the coupled system @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( red dashed lines ) .",
    "we can see that the amplitude on the small scales cmb temperature power spectrum decreases with increasing coupling , due to the earlier epoch of matter - radiation equality @xmath46 . and",
    "the coupling also shifts locations of the cmb peaks towards smaller scales and suppresses the cmb temperature anisotropies on very large scales ( the late - time isw effect ) @xcite .",
    "in our analyses , we consider the following cosmological probes : i ) cmb power spectra ; ii ) the bao signal in the galaxy power spectra ; iii ) direct measurement of the current hubble constant ; iv ) luminosity distances of type ia supernovae .    for the planck data from the 1-year data release @xcite , we use the low-@xmath47 and high-@xmath47 cmb temperature power spectrum data from planck with the low-@xmath47 wmap9 polarization data ( planck+wp ) .",
    "we marginalize over the nuisance parameters that model the unresolved foregrounds with wide priors @xcite .",
    "we also consider the cmb lensing data obtained from planck @xcite seperately . for comparison",
    ", we also use the wmap9 cmb temperature and polarization power spectra @xcite in our calculations .",
    "bao provides an efficient method for measuring the expansion history by using features in the clustering of galaxies within large scale surveys as a ruler with which to measure the distance - redshift relation . since the current bao data are not accurate enough , one can only determine an effective distance @xcite : @xmath48^{1/3}~.\\ ] ] following the planck analysis @xcite , in this paper we use the bao measurement from the 6df galaxy redshift survey ( 6dfgrs ) at a low redshift ( @xmath49 ) @xcite , and the measurement of the bao scale based on a re - analysis of the luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) sample from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 at the median redshift ( @xmath50 ) @xcite , and the bao signal from boss cmass dr9 data at ( @xmath51 ) @xcite .",
    "we also add a gaussian prior on the current hubble constant given by ref .",
    "@xcite ; @xmath52 @xmath53 ( 68% c.l . ) .",
    "the quoted error includes both statistical and systematic errors .",
    "this measurement of @xmath6 is obtained from the magnitude - redshift relation of 240 low - z type ia supernovae at @xmath54 by the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer camera 2 of hst .",
    "finally , we include data from type ia supernovae , which consists of luminosity distance measurements as a function of redshift , @xmath55 . in this paper",
    "we consider two snia samples : the `` union2.1 '' compilation with 580 samples @xcite and the `` snls '' compilation with 473 supernovae reprocessed by ref .",
    "however , we do not combine them together in the numerical analysis , since we find that these two snia samples give quite different constraints on the coupled dark energy model .",
    "when calculating the likelihood , we marginalize the nuisance parameters , like the absolute magnitude @xmath56 and the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath0 , as explained by ref . @xcite .",
    "we perform a global fitting of cosmological parameters using the cosmomc package @xcite , a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) code .",
    "we assume purely adiabatic initial conditions and neglect the primordial tensor fluctuations .",
    "the basic six cosmological parameters are allowed to vary with top - hat priors : the cold dark matter energy density parameter @xmath58 $ ] , the baryon energy density parameter @xmath59 $ ] , the scalar spectral index @xmath60 $ ] , the primordial amplitude @xmath61 \\in [ 2.7 , 4.0]$ ] , the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon at decoupling to the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface @xmath62 $ ] , and the optical depth to re - ionization @xmath63 $ ] . the pivot scale is set at @xmath64 @xmath45 .",
    "there are two more parameters : @xmath65 and @xmath0 in the potential and coupling forms of the coupled dark energy model .",
    "in addition , cosmomc imposes a weak prior on the hubble parameter : @xmath66 $ ] .",

    "interestingly , these two datasets strongly favor a high value of the hubble constant , which is significantly different from that obtained from the `` normal '' data @xcite .",
    "therefore , we combine these two datasets together to constrain the coupled dark energy model and call it the `` tension '' data . in table [ table2 ] we list the constraints on some parameters from the `` tension '' data combinations .",
    "the interaction between the quintessence scalar field and the cold dark matter significantly modifies the evolutions of their energy density @xcite . for a positive coupling , the energy of cold dark matter transfers to dark energy .",
    "consequently , the effective eos of dark energy becomes smaller than that in the uncoupled system .",
    "the current hubble constant must be increased correspondingly in order to produce the same expansion rate .",
    "therefore , the strength of coupling @xmath0 is correlated with the hubble constant @xmath6 . including the measurements on @xmath6",
    "could be helpful to break the degeneracy .",
    "so we first add the hst gaussian prior on @xmath6 in the calculations .",
    "due to the large discrepancy on @xmath6 between planck+wp and hst prior , adding the hst prior to the planck+wp data forces the obtained median value of @xmath6 towards to the higher one , namely @xmath68 @xmath53 ( @xmath5 c.l . ) .",
    "as a consequence , the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath6 induces a likelihood peak for the strength of coupling : @xmath69 which apparently departs from the minimally coupled system , which is shown in figure [ tension_1d ] ( blue dashed lines ) .",
    "we also include the `` snls '' supernovae sample into the calculations and find the similar conclusion with that obtained by adding the hst prior .",
    "planck+wp+snls data favor a high value of hubble constant @xmath70 @xmath53 ( @xmath5 c.l . ) and a non - zero coupling parameter @xmath71 ( @xmath5 c.l . ) . finally , we combine the snls and the hst prior together and the situation becomes worse , shown in figure [ tension_1d ] ( black solid lines ) .",
    "the `` tension '' data combination yields the tight constraints on the hubble constant @xmath72 @xmath53 ( @xmath5 c.l . ) and the strength of coupling parameter : @xmath73 the preference for a non - zero coupling increases . in figure [ tension_2d ]",
    "we show the two - dimensional contours in the ( @xmath0,@xmath6 ) panel from different data combinations , which is clearly shown that @xmath0 and @xmath6 are correlated .",
    "when comparing with the contour obtained from planck+wp data , the `` normal '' data give consistent constraint on the hubble constant .",
    "therefore , this data combination only reduces the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath6 to give better constraint on @xmath0",
    ". however , the `` tension '' data favor a high value of the hubble constant . using this data combination shifts the two - dimensional contour towards high values of @xmath6 .",

    "in this paper we have presented the latest cosmological constraints on the coupled dark energy models , in which the quintessence scalar field non - minimally couples to the cold dark matter , from the recent planck measurements .",
    "since the cmb anisotropies mainly contain the information about the high - redshift universe , planck+wp data alone can not constrain the strength of coupling strongly , namely the @xmath2 c.l .",
    "upper limit is @xmath75 .",
    "when we combine the planck+wp with the bao , snia `` union2.1 '' compilation and the cmb lensing data from planck , this `` normal '' data yield a very tight constraint on the strength , @xmath76 at @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "different from the dark energy model with a constant equation of state parameter @xmath9 , the tension between constraints on @xmath6 from the planck+wp and the hst @xmath6 prior can not be eased in the coupled dark energy models , since in these models the effective eos of dark energy is always larger than @xmath10 .",
