    "stable and secure power grid operation relies on accurate monitoring of the state of its different components , including line currents and bus voltages .",
    "the state vector is estimated in a power grid by using a variety of measurement units in different buses and lines operating in the grid .",
    "these measurements are also used to facilitate operation of the electricity market through locational marginal pricing @xcite . given their importance in the operation of the grid , error free delivery of data from the distributed meters to the central controller for state estimation is a critical need of every power grid .",
    "the effect of incorrect data collection had received attention in the @xmath0 north - east blackout where incorrect telemetry due to an inoperative state estimator was listed as one of its principal causes @xcite .",
    "today supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) systems help relay the measurements to the state estimator of the grid for use in stability analysis and opf solvers .",
    "however the presence of distributed meters spread across the entire geographical area covered by the power grid makes the grid vulnerable to cyber - attacks aimed at introducing malicious measurements .",
    "in fact , it has been reported that cyber - hacking had previously compromised the u.s .",
    "electric grid @xcite and can lead to sub - optimal electricity prices @xcite .",
    "we consider here a scenario where an adversary in the power grid gains control of some meters in the grid and inject malicious data which can lead to incorrect state estimation . in reality , measurements collected have random noise due to measurement errors , but state estimators are able to overcome those through the use of statistical methods like maximum likelihood criterion and weighted least - square criterion @xcite .",
    "a coordinated attack on multiple meters by an adversary can evade detection by the standard mechanism present at the estimator and go unobservable and not raise any alarm at the state estimator .",
    "reference @xcite studies this problem of hidden attacks on the power grid which are not detected by tests on the residual of the measurements and shows that a few measurements are enough for the adversary to produce a hidden attack .",
    "the authors of @xcite also show that the set of protected measurements needed to prevent a hidden attack is of the same size as the number of state variables in the grid .",
    "full protection from any hidden attack is thus very expensive .",
    "there have been multiple efforts aimed at studying the construction of malicious attack vectors for the adversary . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors discuss the optimal attack - vector construction for the constrained adversary using @xmath1 and @xmath2 recovery methods .",
    "a constrained adversary is governed by its objective to manipulate the measurements of the minimum number of meters to produce the desired errors in estimation .",
    "reference @xcite provides an approach for the creation of the optimal attack vector based on mixed integer linear programming .",
    "such design approaches are np - hard in general and hence require relaxations of the problem statement and provide approximate solutions at best . in addition , previous work such as that in @xcite requires certain assumptions on states of the system which may not hold in general .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an adversary with constrained resources . following the attack model in @xcite ,",
    "we define the objective of the adversary as identifying the minimum number of meters that may be manipulated in order to create a hidden attack vector using those meters .",
    "we use graph - theoretic ideas like min - cut calculations in determining this optimal attack vector . unlike previous work",
    ", we show that our solution does not require any assumption on the structure of the grid or any relaxation of the problem statement .",
    "the complexity of the algorithm for attack vector construction is shown to be polynomial in the number of nodes ( buses ) and edges ( lines ) in the power grid . given the size of large power grids , polynomial running time of the algorithm justifies its significance when compared with np - hard and brute force methods used in the existing literature .",
    "in addition , the algorithm for attack vector construction does not depend on the exact values of the measurement matrix used in state estimation , relying primarily on the adjacency matrix of the network representing the power grid . this is significant , since the adjacency matrix of grids is often already known or can be approximated by an adversary from publicly available information . using the novel graph theoretic framework discussed in this paper that requires only the adjacency matrix of the graph representing the power grid , the adversary can , thus , generate the optimal attack vector for malicious hidden attacks on the grid using a polynomial time algorithm .",
    "we demonstrate that the power grid is significantly vulnerable to hidden attacks from even constrained adversaries with limited information ( adjacency matrix in our case ) .",
    "we are unaware of any existing work providing optimal solution to this hidden attack problem in polynomial time .",
    "the framework developed is easily extended to formulate attack vectors in cases when certain measurements in the system are already protected or the state vector is partially known , i.e. , some of the state variables are protected",
    ". we also provide algorithms to select , in a greedy fashion , critical measurements for protection to prevent a hidden attack given the prior knowledge of the adversary s resources ( maximum number of measurements it can corrupt ) .",
    "present power grids have additional meters called phasor measurement units ( pmus ) installed on a few buses @xcite,@xcite .",
    "placement of a pmu at a given bus in the power grid provides measurement of the voltage phasor at that bus as well as the current flows of all lines incident on that bus .",
    "we discuss pmu placement in power grids in the context of hidden data attacks in detail in a separate section .",
    "the problems discussed in this context include designing an optimal attack vector for a grid equipped with pmus , and the selection of locations for placement of pmus in the grid in order to provide increased protection to the grid .",
    "the main results of this paper are as follows :    * we provide a graph theoretic formulation for the problem of constructing an adversarial optimal attack vector with the minimum number of non - zero values that results in a hidden attack on the grid .",
    "further , we present a algorithm that results in an exact solution to the problem and prove its optimality and polynomial - time complexity . *",
    "we discuss different variations of the adversarial attack problem , given the knowledge of certain prevailing protected measurements and state variables within the grid .",
    "we extend this discussion to power systems with pmus installed at a few buses . *",
    "we present greedy algorithms to select additional protected measurements and locations for placement of pmus in the grid , in order to hinder an adversarial hidden attack on the grid . *",
    "we study the performance of the algorithms through simulations on ieee test bus systems and compare them with other algorithms in literature , as well as with brute force techniques .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section presents a description of the system model used in estimating the state variables in a power grid and formulation of the adversarial attack problem .",
    "the novel algorithm to determine the optimal solution to this problem , which includes selection of the measurements to attack and generating the attack vector , is discussed in section [ sec : adversary solution ] .",
    "construction of the attack vector in the presence of protected measurements and state variables in the system is discussed in section [ sec : variations ] .",
    "algorithms to select existing measurements in the system for protection to prevent hidden attacks on the grid are provided in section [ sec : gm ] .",
    "power grids with installed pmus are discussed in section [ sec : pmu ] wherein we design attack vectors for systems with pmus and also analyze the placement of additional pmus against hidden attacks for such systems .",
    "simulations of the proposed algorithms on test ieee bus systems and comparisons with other algorithms and brute force methods are reported in section [ sec : results ] . finally , concluding remarks and future directions of work",
    "are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we represent the power grid using an undirected graph @xmath3 , where @xmath4 represents the set of buses and @xmath5 represents the set of transmission lines connecting those buses .",
    "there are two kinds of measurements in the power grid in this model : flow measurements and voltage phasor measurements .",
    "meter on a line in @xmath5 measure the power flow through that line while a meter on a bus in @xmath4 measure the voltage phasor at that bus .",
    "in addition , a pmu can collect both these kinds of measurements ( bus voltage and current flows in all lines connected to that bus ) .",
    "this model is sufficiently general and can include cases where some bus voltages or line measurements are measured multiple times for redundancy .",
    "figure [ 14bus ] shows the graph representation of the ieee 14 bus test system",
    ". it can be found at @xcite .",
    "we consider the dc power flow model in a power grid @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the vector of measurements .",
    "@xmath8 is the state vector and consists of the voltage phase angles at the buses in the grid .",
    "the voltage magnitudes are taken as unity in the dc model .",
    "@xmath9 is the measurement matrix which relates the measurements with the state vector and @xmath10 is the zero mean gaussian noise vector associated with the measurements . in general ,",
    "@xmath11 which implies that there are more measurements than state variables to help provide redundant measurements to the state estimator . here",
    ", @xmath9 depends on the topology of the network , the location of the meters as well as on the parameters of transmission lines ( like resistance and susceptance ) .",
    "the dc power flow on a line @xmath12 between buses @xmath13 and @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the magnitude of susceptance of the line @xmath17 .",
    "if the @xmath18 measurement corresponds to this flow in line @xmath17 , then @xmath19 is given by : @xmath20 the associated row in the measurement matrix ( @xmath21 ) is a sparse vector with two non - zero values , @xmath16 at the @xmath22 position and @xmath23 at the @xmath24 position .",

    "the measurement matrix is , thus , very sparse with a maximum of @xmath29 non - zero values per row . in order to enable correct state estimation ,",
    "the measurement matrix must have full column rank of @xmath30 .",
    "the state estimator uses the measurements and outputs the estimated state vector @xmath31 by minimizing the residual @xmath32 . in normal operation , the magnitude of the minimum residual is smaller than an established threshold which monitors the correctness of the estimate .",
    "+ given such an estimator , the adversary corrupts the measurement vector @xmath33 by adding an attack vector @xmath34 to generate the new measurements of the form @xmath35 .",
    "it is fairly straightforward ( @xcite ) that , if @xmath34 satisfies @xmath36 for some @xmath37 , then the residual calculated by the estimator remains the same as before .",
    "therefore the estimator remains incapable of detecting the presence of an attack , outputting an erroneous state vector estimate @xmath38 .",
    "attack vector construction refers to the creation of an optimal attack vector @xmath34 to corrupt the measurements .",
    "reference @xcite creates such attack vectors by using a projection matrix @xmath39 using the measurement matrix @xmath9 .",
    "a major problem of interest here is the case of a constrained adversary with limited resources .",
    "such an adversary attacks the minimum number of measurements to create a successful hidden attack . here",
    ", an attack is considered successful if at least @xmath40 state variable suffers a change in magnitude after the attack .",
    "equivalently , the construction of the attack vector @xmath41 can be characterized as a solution of the following optimization problem : @xmath42 this is similar to the attacker s problem in @xcite , where the constraint @xmath43 is replaced by the constraint @xmath44 .",
    "both these problem formulations are essentially the same as every solution of problem ( [ opt_attack ] ) can be suitably scaled to result in a solution obtained in @xcite . for every non - zero @xmath45 , @xmath46 satisfies the constraint @xmath44 .    in the next section",
    ", we present our algorithm for designing an optimal attack vector using graph theory . unlike @xcite",

    "we first augment one extra column @xmath48 to the right of the matrix @xmath9 to create a @xmath47 times @xmath49 modified measurement matrix @xmath50 such that for every row @xmath27 with a phase angle measurement , the new column @xmath51 has a value of @xmath52 at the @xmath53 location .",

    "the new formulation ( @xmath60 ) provides a reference phase angle of @xmath55 ( represented by the extra element in @xmath59 ) such that phase angle measurement at a bus becomes equivalent to a line flow measurement between the bus and reference phase angle .",
    "note that every row in @xmath50 has @xmath29 non - zero elements and corresponds to a line flow measurement now .",
    "next , we state and prove a theorem which will enable us to develop the algorithm for attack vector .    [ 01 ] there exists a non - zero binary @xmath61 vector @xmath62 of size @xmath30 times @xmath40 for the optimal attack vector @xmath41 given by problem ( [ opt_attack ] ) such that @xmath63",

    "consider @xmath69 .",
    "for every non - zero phase angle measurement in @xmath70 , we have a corresponding non - zero measurement in @xmath71 .",
    "however , in case of a non - zero value of line flow measurement in @xmath70 between two neighboring buses @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath72 , the corresponding value of @xmath71 is @xmath55 as @xmath73 .",
    "it , thus , follows from the structure of the @xmath9 matrix that @xmath74 .",
    "since @xmath64 is the optimal attack vector with minimum number of non - zero entries , we have @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath71 also gives an optimal attack vector and @xmath63 .",
    "now , consider the modified measurement matrix @xmath50 and the augmented vector @xmath59 . using equation ( [ modify ] ) and the previous theorem , we conclude that the optimal attack vector is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the @xmath61 vector given by @xmath78",
    ".    minimizing the number of measurements needed by the adversary to inject the optimal attack vector is equivalent to minimizing the number of non - zero flow measurements given by @xmath79 . since we are concerned only with @xmath80 and @xmath59",
    "is a @xmath61 vector , we observe that the exact values of susceptance present in @xmath50 are not needed to get the optimal attack vector . in fact , the contribution of a flow measurement of @xmath79 in @xmath80 will remain the same even if the susceptance @xmath16 of every line included in @xmath50 is changed to @xmath40 .",
    "we , therefore , create an incidence matrix @xmath81 of dimension @xmath47 x @xmath49 from @xmath50 by replacing every positive element in @xmath50 with a @xmath40 in @xmath81 and each negative element in @xmath50 with to a @xmath52 in @xmath81 .",

    "it is clear that for a given @xmath61 vector @xmath59 , @xmath85 .",
    "further , using theorem [ 01 ] , the optimization problem ( [ opt_attack ] ) can be written as @xmath86 this is the classical min - cut partition problem in graph theory .",

    "next , we show how the algorithm @xmath40 can be used to design the optimal attack vector in the presence of protected measurements and state variables in the system .",
    "certain measurements in the power grid are protected from cyber - attacks by encryptions or by geographical isolation .",
    "this imposes a constraint on the adversary by requiring that the values of the attack vector @xmath34 corresponding to protected measurements be made @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , certain state variables might be protected from adversarial contamination due to the presence of secure channels of collecting their values .",
    "let @xmath96 be the set of protected measurements and @xmath97 be the set of protected state variables .",

    "until now , we have discussed the adversary s strategy for designing attack vectors towards causing hidden data attacks on the grid .",
    "we will use this knowledge in the next section to discuss policies that can be adopted by the power grid system operator or controller to restrict the efficacy of hidden attacks .",

    "the algorithm is of course sub - optimal compared to a computationally intensive brute force search of the best measurements for protection .",
    "in this section , we extend the ideas developed in the previous sections to power grids with phasor measurement units ( pmus ) .",

    "we take ieee-14 bus system and place flow measurements in all lines and voltage measurements on random @xmath126 of the buses .",
    "figure [ attack14 ] shows the increase in the average size of the optimal attack vector with increase in the fraction of randomly protected measurements placed in the system .",
    "we see that plots generated by simulations of our algorithms and that obtained through brute force search for the optimal attack vector overlap completely , depicting optimal performance .",
    "it can be seen from the same figure that the performance of our algorithms are much better than the output of the @xmath2 relaxation given in problem ( [ opt_attack2modify ] ) .",
    "next , we plot the output of algorithm @xmath29 and show its improved performance over the output of a @xmath2 relaxation approach for 30 , 57 and 118 ieee test bus systems under different system conditions in figure [ attackall ] .",
    "the output of @xmath2 relaxation is not close to optimal as commendable performance of @xmath127 solvers requires the measurement matrix to satisfy certain necessary conditions @xcite .",
    "such conditions are difficult to satisfy for test - systems where the network and the measurement matrices are not random , as in our case .    we now present results on our approach to problem ( [ opt_attack3 ] ) , which is given by algorithm @xmath114 . here",
    ", we select , in a greedy fashion , the @xmath110 best measurements for protection such that the minimum number of measurements needed for a successful hidden attack increases the most .",
    "figure [ measprot14 ] shows the performance of our greedy algorithm @xmath114 for different values of @xmath110 for the ieee-14 bus system with flow measurements on all lines , voltage measurements on @xmath126 of the buses and @xmath128 of measurements initially protected .",
    "we observe that the performance of the greedy algorithm in increasing the size of the optimal attack vector is comparable to a computationally intensive brute - force selection for protecting additional measurements in this case .",
    "we also simulate algorithm @xmath114 for ieee 30 , 57 and 118 bus systems and plot the average improvement in the cardinality of the optimal attack vector with an increase in the value of @xmath110 in figure [ measprotgreedy ] .",
    "it is important to note that the minimum cardinality of the optimal attack vector @xmath41 does not increase significantly with a small increase in @xmath110 or fraction of protected measurements in all the different test systems considered .",
    "this observation can be explained using the fact that the test - systems are sparse and have several buses with low degree and thus have a low min - cut .",
    "determination of optimal attack vectors in the presence of secure pmus for the ieee 30 and 57 bus systems is shown in figure [ attackpmu ] . in either test system ,",
    "we place line flow measurements in each bus and phase angle measurements in @xmath126 of the buses .",
    "we observe an expected increase in the average size of the optimal attack vector on increasing the fraction of buses randomly selected for placement of secure pmus .",
    "finally , we show the performance of algorithm @xmath125 in the ieee 30-bus system . in the base case , we put line flow measurements in each bus of the system , phase angle measurement in random @xmath126 of the buses and protect @xmath129 of the measurements selected randomly .",
    "algorithm @xmath125 is used to place @xmath110 additional pmus on buses to increase the cardinality of the optimal attack vector for the system .",
    "we observe again that enough secure pmus need to be placed in the grid to significantly increase the cardinality of the optimal attack vector as high sparsity of the network graph and low degrees of the nodes keep the graph min - cut low",

    "in this paper , we study an adversarial problem of causing errors in estimation of state variables in a power grid through injection of suitably hidden measurement errors .",
    "we formulate this problem in terms of controlling and manipulating a minimum set of measurements in order to affect a successful hidden attack as an @xmath1 optimization problem .",
    "we introduce a novel graph - theoretic approach to designing the optimal attack vector using min - cuts .",
    "the proposed algorithm has polynomial time complexity and is shown to result in an optimal output given a configuration of the power grid .",
    "we show that our algorithm gives the optimal output even when a fraction of the measurements have existing protection and performs much better than a @xmath2 relaxation of the problem . from the system operator s perspective",
    ", we develop an algorithm to identify measurements in the system that provide additional protection , aimed at preventing and/or reducing the efficacy of hidden attacks by an adversary .",
    "although sub - optimal , the low complexity algorithm can be used to protect measurements to increase the set of measurements that the adversary must control in order to cause a successful hidden attack on the system .",
    "further , we extend the discussion on hidden attacks in the grid to systems with pmus and discuss design of optimal attack vector for a system with pmus and placement of additional secure pmus in the system to prevent such attacks .",
    "the advantage of using low complexity algorithms to provide security against hidden attacks is immense for large power grids with several thousand buses and lines .",
    "this work can be extended to include other hidden attacks where the adversary is not limited by number of attacked meters but other resources .",
    "another extension includes determining the minimum set of key measurements for protection by the system operator given the knowledge of the adversary s maximum capacity to attack the power grid .",
    "this is the focus of our current work .",
