    "quantum mechanics , after more than 70 years , still poses fundamental problems of understanding .",
    "many physicists believe these problems are ` only ' problems of ` physical interpretation ' of the mathematically well defined ` standard formalism ' . in this paper",
    "we will show that this is not necessarily so .",
    "we will show that the problem of quantum mechanics connected to the existence of nonproduct states in the situation of the description of the joint entity of two quantum entities may well indicate that a change of the standard formalism is necessary .",
    "if we mention the ` standard formalism ' of quantum mechanics we mean the formalism as exposed , for example , in the book of john von neumann ( 1932 ) , and we will refer to it by sqm .",
    "often the name ` pure state ' is used to indicate a state represented by a ray of the hilbert space .",
    "we will however use it in the physical sense : a ` pure state ' of an entity represents the reality of this entity . as a consequence it is natural to demand that an entity ` exists ' if and only if at any moment it is in one and only one ` pure state ' .",
    "let us formulate this as a principle , since it will play a major role in our analysis .",
    "[ physprinc01 ] if we consider an entity , then this entity ` exists ' at a certain moment iff it ` is ' in one and only one pure state at that moment .",
    "we denote pure states of an entity @xmath0 by means of symbols @xmath1 and the set of all pure states by @xmath2 .",
    "we mention that in ( aerts , 1984a , 1999a ) , where aspects of the problem that we investigate in the present paper are analyzed , a ` pure state ' is called a ` state ' .    a state represented by a ray of the hilbert space",
    "will be called a ` ray state ' .",
    "we denote rays by symbols @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and we denote @xmath5 the ` ray state ' represented by the ray @xmath6 . with each ray @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,",
    "corresponds one and only one ray state @xmath5 .",
    "one of the principles of standard quantum mechanics is that ` pure states ' are ` ray states ' .",
    "[ qmprinc01 ] consider an entity @xmath0 described by sqm in a hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "each ray state @xmath5 , @xmath8 is a pure state of @xmath0 , and each pure state of @xmath0 is of this form .",
    "the problem that we want to consider in this paper appears in the sqm description by of the joint entity @xmath0 of two quantum entities @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "[ qmprinc02 ] if we consider two quantum entities @xmath10 and @xmath11 described by sqm in hilbert spaces @xmath12 and @xmath13 , then the joint quantum entity @xmath0 consisting of these two quantum entities is described by sqm in the tensor product hilbert space @xmath14 .",
    "the subentities @xmath10 and @xmath11 are in ray states @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , iff the joint entity @xmath0 is in a ray state @xmath19 .    in relation to the situation of a joint entity consisting of two subentities",
    "there is another physical principle we generally imagine to be satisfied .",
    "[ physprinc02 ] if an entity is the joint entity of two subentities then the entity exists at a certain moment iff the subentities exist at that moment .",
    "let us introduce the concept of ` nonproduct vectors ' of the tensor product .",
    "for @xmath20 we say that @xmath21 is a nonproduct vector iff @xmath22 .",
    "we are now ready to formulate the theorem that points out the paradox we want to bring forward .    physical principle  [ physprinc01 ] , physical principle  [ physprinc02 ] , sqm principle  [ qmprinc01 ] and sqm principle [ qmprinc02 ] can not be satisfied together .",
    "[ theor01 ] proof : suppose the four principles are satisfied .",
    "this leads to a contradiction . consider the joint entity @xmath0 of two subentities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , described by sqm . from sqm principle [ qmprinc02 ]",
    "follows that if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are described in hilbert spaces @xmath12 and @xmath23 then @xmath0 is described in the hilbert space @xmath24 .",
    "let us consider a nonproduct vector @xmath25 and the ray state @xmath26 .",
    "from sqm principle  [ qmprinc01 ] follows that @xmath26 represents a pure state of @xmath0 .",
    "consider a moment where @xmath0 is in state @xmath26 .",
    "physical principle  [ physprinc01 ] implies that @xmath0 exists at that moment and from physical principle [ physprinc02 ] we infer that @xmath10 and @xmath11 also exist at that moment .",
    "physical principle [ physprinc01 ] then implies that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively in pure states @xmath27 and @xmath28 . from sqm principle [ qmprinc01 ]",
    "it follows that there are two rays @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 such that @xmath33 and @xmath34 . from sqm principle  [ qmprinc02 ] then follows that @xmath0 is in the state @xmath35 which is not @xmath26 since the ray generated by @xmath36 is different from @xmath37 .",
    "since both @xmath26 and @xmath35 are pure states , this contradicts physical principle  [ physprinc01 ] .",
    "the fundamental problems of the sqm description of the joint entity of two subentities had already been remarked a long time ago . the einstein podolsky rosen paradox and later research on the bell inequalities are related to this difficulty ( einstein et al . , 1935 ;",
    "bell , 1964 ) .",
    "it are indeed states like @xmath26 , with @xmath21 a nonproduct vector , that give rise to the violation of the bell inequalities and that generate the typical epr correlations between the subentities .",
    "most of the attention in this earlier analysis went to the ` non local ' character of these epr correlations .",
    "the states of type @xmath26 are now generally called ` entangled ' states .",
    "the problem ( paradox ) related to entangled states that we have outlined in section  [ sec01 ] has often been overlooked , although noticed and partly mentioned in some texts ( e.g. van fraassen , 1991 , section 7.3 and references therein ) .",
    "the problem of the description of a joint entity has also been studied within axiomatic approaches to sqm .",
    "there it was shown that some of the axioms that are needed for sqm are not satisfied for certain well defined situations of a joint entity consisting of two subentities ( aerts , 1982 , 1984a ; pulmannov , 1983 , 1985 ; randall and foulis , 1981 ) .",
    "more specifically , it has been shown in aerts ( 1982 ) that the joint entity of two separated entities can not be described by sqm because of two axioms : weak modularity and the covering law .",
    "this shortcoming of sqm is proven to be at the origin of the epr paradox ( aerts , 1984b , 1985a , b ) .",
    "it has also been shown that different formulations of the product within the mathematical categories employed in the axiomatic structures do not coincide with the tensor product of hilbert spaces ( aerts , 1984a ; pulmannov , 1983 , 1985 ; randall and foulis , 1981 ) . again",
    "certain axioms , orthocomplementation , covering law and atomicity , are causing problems .",
    "all these findings indicate that we are confronted with a deep problem that has several complicated and subtle aspects .",
    "a very extreme attitude was to consider entangled states as artifacts of the mathematical formalism and hence not really existing in nature .",
    "meanwhile , entangled states are readily prepared in the laboratory and the corresponding epr correlations have been detected in a convincing way .",
    "this means that it is very plausible to acknowledge the existence of entangled states as ` pure states ' of the joint entity in the sense of physical principle [ physprinc01 ] .    as a result of earlier research",
    "we have always been inclined to believe that we should drop physical principle [ physprinc02 ] to resolve the paradox ( aerts , 1984a , 1985a , b ; see also aerts , broekaert and smets , 1999 ) .",
    "this comes to considering the subentities @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the joint entity @xmath0 as ` not existing ' if the joint entity is in an entangled state .",
    "we still believe that this is a possible solution to the paradox and refer for example to valckenborgh ( 1999 ) and aerts and valckenborgh ( 1999 ) for further structural elaboration in this direction . in the present paper we would like to bring forward an alternative solution . to make it explicit",
    "we introduce the concept of ` density state ' , which is a state represented by a density operator of the hilbert space .",
    "we denote density operators by symbols @xmath38 and the corresponding density states by @xmath39 . with each density operator",
    "@xmath40 on @xmath9 corresponds one and only one density state @xmath41 . within sqm density states",
    "are supposed to represent mixtures , i.e. situations of lack of knowledge about the pure state .",
    "the way out of the paradox we propose in the present paper consists of considering the density states as pure states .",
    "hence , in this sense , sqm principle 1 would be false and substituted by a new principle .",
    "[ cqmprinc ] consider an entity @xmath0 described in a hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "each density state @xmath41 , where @xmath40 is a density operator of @xmath9 , is a pure state of @xmath0 , and each pure state of @xmath0 is of this form",
    ".    we call the quantum mechanics that retains all the old principles except sqm principle [ qmprinc01 ] , and that follows our new principle cqm principle [ cqmprinc ] , ` completed quantum mechanics ' and refer to it by cqm .",
    "the first argument for our proposal of this solution comes from earlier work in relation with the violation of bell inequalities by means of macroscopic entities ( aerts , 1991a ) .",
    "there we introduce a macroscopic material entity that entails epr correlations .",
    "let us briefly describe this entity again to state our point .",
    "first we represent the spin of a spin @xmath42 quantum entity by means of the elastic sphere model that we have introduced on several occasions ( aerts , 1986 , 1987 , 1991a , b , 1993 , 1995 , 1999a , b ) , and that we have called the ` quantum machine ' .",
    "it is well known that the states , ray states as well as density states , of the spin of a spin @xmath43 entity can be represented by the points of a sphere @xmath44 in three dimensional euclidean space with radius @xmath45 and center @xmath46 .",
    "let us denote the state corresponding to the point @xmath47 by @xmath48 . to make the representation explicit we remark that each vector @xmath49 can uniquely be written as a convex linear combination of two vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 on the surface of the sphere ( fig .",
    "2 ) i.e. @xmath52 with @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 . in this way",
    "we make correspond with @xmath55 the density operator @xmath56 : @xmath57 each density operator can be written in this form and hence the inverse correspondence is also made explicit .",
    "we remark that the ray states , namely the density operators that are projections , correspond to the points on the surface of @xmath44 .",
    "it is much less known that the experiments on the spin of a spin @xmath42 quantum entity can be represented within the same picture .",
    "let us denote the direction in which the spin will be measured by the diametrically opposed vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the surface of @xmath44 ( fig .  1 ) , and",
    "let us consider @xmath58 as the @xmath21 direction of the standard spin representation ( this does not restrict the generality of our calculation ) . in this case , in sqm , the spin measurement along @xmath58 , which we denote @xmath60 ,",
    "is represented by the self adjoint operator @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the spectral projections .",
    "the sqm transition probabilities , @xmath63 , the probability for spin up outcome if the state is @xmath48 , and @xmath64 , the probability for spin down outcome if the state is @xmath48 , are then : @xmath65 let us now show that , using the sphere picture , we can propose a realizable mechanistic procedure that gives rise to the same probabilities and can therefore represent the spin measurement .",

    "well , if we consider the singlet spin state , then this is obviously a nonproduct state , and hence the states of the subentities are density states .",
    "in fact they are the density states @xmath94 and @xmath95 where @xmath96 however , the state of the joint entity is clearly not given by the density state corresponding to the density operator @xmath97 because this state does not entail correlations .",
    "it is due the presence of the epr correlations that the state of the joint entity is represented by a ray state . in our macroscopic mechanistic model",
    "however all the states ( also the states of the subentities ) are ` pure states ' and not mixtures ( remark that we use the concept ` pure state ' as defined in section [ sec01 ] ) . if our proposal were true , namely if density states as well as ray states in principle represented pure states , we could also understand why , although the state of the joint entity uniquely determines the states of the subentities , and hence physical principle [ physprinc02 ] is satisfied , the inverse is not true : the states of the subentities do not determine the state of the joint entity . indeed , a state of one subentity can not contain the information about the presence of an eventual correlation between the subentities . this way , it is natural that different types of correlations can give rise to different states of the joint entity , the subentities being in the same states .",
    "this possibility expresses the philosophical principle that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and as our model shows it is also true in the macroscopic world .",
    "let us now say some words about the generality of the construction that inspired us for the proposed solution . it has been shown in coecke ( 1995a ) that a quantum machine like model can be realized for higher dimensional quantum entities .",
    "coecke ( 1995b , 1996 ) also showed that all the states of the tensor product can be realized by introducing correlations on the different component states .",
    "this means that we can recover all the nonproduct ray states of the tensor product hilbert space by identifying them with a product state plus a specific correlation for a general quantum entity and hence that our solution of the paradox is a possible solution for a general quantum entity .",
    "if we carefully analyze the calculations that show the equivalence of our model to the quantum model , we can understand why the distinction between ` interpreting density states as mixtures ' and ` interpreting density states as pure states ' can not be made experimentally .",
    "indeed , because of the linearity of the trace , used to calculate the quantum transition probabilities , and because the inner points of the sphere can be written as convex linear combinations of the surface points , an ontological situation of mixtures must give the same experimental results as an ontological situation of pure states .    if we would be able to realize experimentally a nonlinear evolution of one of the subentities that has been brought into an entangled state with the other subentity as subentity of a joint entity , it would be possible to test our hypothesis and to detect experimentally whether density states are pure states or mixtures . indeed",
    ", suppose that we a nonlinear evolution of one of the entangled subentities could be realized .",
    "then , we can distinguish the two possibilities in the following way .",
    "if the density state @xmath94 of the entangled subentity is a mixture , then this state evolves while staying a convex linear combination of the ray states @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( referring to the situation of fig .  3 ) .",
    "the nonlinear evolution makes evolve the ray states @xmath98 and @xmath99 and this determines the evolution of the density state @xmath94 , but the correspondence between @xmath94 and @xmath98 and @xmath99 remains linear .",
    "if the density state @xmath94 of the entangled subentity is a pure state , then the nonlinear evolution will make it evolve independent of the way in which the ray states @xmath98 and @xmath99 evolve .",
    "this means that in general the relation between @xmath94 and @xmath98 and @xmath99 will not remain that of a convex linear combination .",
    "so we can conclude that for a nonlinear evolution the change of the density state of an entangled subentity under this evolution will be different depending on whether it is a mixture or a pure state .",
    "this difference can experimentally be detected by a proper experimental setup .",
    "we believe that such an experiment would be of great importance for the problem that we have outlined here .",
    "the quantum axiomatic approaches make use of piron s representation theorem where the set of pure states is represented as the set of rays of a generalized hilbert space ( piron , 1964 , 1976 ) . this theorem has meanwhile been elaborated and the recent result of solr has made it possible to formulate an axiomatics that characterizes sqm for real , complex or quaternionic hilbert spaces ( sler 1995 , aerts and van steirteghem 1999 ) .",
    "this standard axiomatic approach aims to represent pure states by rays of the hilbert space .",
    "if our proposal is true , an axiomatic system should be constructed that aims at representing pure states by means of density operators of the hilbert space . within the generalization of the geneva - brussels approach that we have formulated recently , and where the mathematical category is that of state property systems and their morphisms , such an axiomatic can be developed ( aerts , 1999a ; aerts et al .",
    "1999 ; van steirteghem , 1999 ; van der voorde 1999 ) . in aerts ( 1999c )",
    "we made a small step in the direction of developing such an axiomatic system by introducing the concept of ` atomic pure states ' and treating them as earlier the pure states were treated , aiming to represent these atomic pure states by the rays of a hilbert space .",
    "we proved that in this case the covering law remains a problematic axiom in relation to the description of the joint entity of two subentities ( theorem 18 of aerts 1999c ) .",
    "we are convinced that we would gain more understanding in the joint entity problem if a new axiomatic would be worked out , aiming to represent pure states by density operators of a hilbert space , and we are planning to engage in such a project in the coming years .",
