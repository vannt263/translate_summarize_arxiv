    "we consider the classical lane - emden problem @xmath13 where @xmath1 is the unit ball of @xmath2 , @xmath14 , centered at the origin and @xmath4 , with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the critical exponent for the sobolev embedding @xmath17 .",
    "in this paper we study the morse index of the radial solutions of .",
    "we recall that the _ morse index _ @xmath8 of a solution @xmath6 of is the maximal dimension of a subspace @xmath18 where the quadratic form associated to the linearized operator at @xmath6 : @xmath19 is negative definite .",
    "equivalently , since @xmath1 is a bounded domain , @xmath8 can be defined as the number of the negative dirichlet eigenvalues of @xmath20 counted with their multiplicity .",
    "it is well known that possess infinitely many radial solutions among which only one is positive ( or negative ) while all the others change sign and can be characterized by the number of their nodal regions . for a given radial solution @xmath6 of with @xmath7 nodal domains",
    ", it has been proved in @xcite that the _ radial morse index _ , i.e. the number of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath20 in the sobolev space of radial functions @xmath21 , is exactly @xmath7 .",
    "obviously the morse index @xmath8 , in @xmath22 , can be larger than @xmath7 , because of the presence of negative non radial eigenvalues of @xmath20 .",
    "+ the knowledge of the morse index is , in general , a very important qualitative property of a solution . in particular",
    "it helps to classify the solutions and study their stability or possible bifurcations .",
    "a first estimate that we get for a radial solution @xmath6 of with @xmath7 nodal domains is the following one ( see theorem [ teo : aftpacgen ] ) : @xmath23 which improves a result in @xcite .    the main theorem of the present paper states that for @xmath10 close to the critical exponent the extimate is sharp .",
    "more precisely we prove :    [ teoprincipalemorse ] let @xmath3 and @xmath6 be a radial solution to with @xmath24 nodal regions .",
    "then @xmath25    let us make a few comments about this result pointing out some interesting features of the formula .",
    "first , writing as @xmath26 we see that the morse index @xmath8 grows linearly with respect to the number @xmath7 of nodal domains , which corresponds also to the number of negative radial eigenvalues of the operator @xmath20 ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) .",
    "this is somehow surprising since , in general , one would expect _ many more _ negative nonradial eigenvalues then the negative radial ones . indeed if we look at the distribution of the radial and nonradial eigenvalues of the linear operator @xmath27 in @xmath22 we observe that :    * on one side by a result of brning - heintze and donnelly @xcite we get that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath7-th radial eigenvalues of @xmath30 , which implies that the number @xmath31 of the radial eigenvalues of @xmath30 bounded by @xmath32 is @xmath7 , more precisely @xmath33 * on the other side by the classical weil law ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of all the eigenvalues of @xmath30 in @xmath22 less than or equal to @xmath32    in an equivalent way we can observe that if we consider a radial eigenfunction of @xmath30 in @xmath22 with @xmath7 nodal regions , i.e. corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath29 , then its _ morse index _ is just the number of the eigenvalues less than @xmath29 which , by ( i ) and ( ii ) , grows at a rate of order @xmath36 and so faster then @xmath7 ( if @xmath37 ) as @xmath38 . + so @xmath20 represents an example of a linear , schrdinger type , operator determined by the potential @xmath39 , for @xmath10 approaching @xmath11 , for which ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) do not hold , at least for the negative eigenvalues .    another interesting consequence of all this could be derived studying as @xmath40 . in this case",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture the convergence of the morse index @xmath8 to the morse index of the dirichlet radial eigenfunction of @xmath30 with @xmath7 nodal regions ( i.e. the eigenfunction corresponding to the radial eigenvalue @xmath29 ) possibly augmented by the multiplicity of @xmath29 , which is @xmath41 .",
    "indeed suitable normalizations of solutions of converge to eigenfunctions of the laplacian as @xmath40 ( see ) .",
    "therefore the previous considerations indicate that for large @xmath7 the morse index @xmath8 for @xmath10 close to @xmath41 is of order @xmath36 , hence it is much bigger than @xmath42 , which is by the morse index of @xmath6 for @xmath10 close to @xmath11 .",
    "so bifurcations from @xmath6 should appear , as @xmath10 ranges from @xmath41 to @xmath11 , showing that the structure of the solution set of is richer than one could imagine .",
    "next we would like to point out another interesting fact : the formula _ does not hold in dimension @xmath43 , as @xmath44_. indeed in the recent paper @xcite we have proved the following :    [ teoprincipalemorsen2 ] let @xmath6 be a radial sign - changing solution to with @xmath45 nodal regions , but with @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ". then @xmath48    obviously @xmath49 for @xmath43 and @xmath50 .",
    "note that in this case the value of @xmath51 seems to be related to the morse index of one of the radial solutions to the singular liouville problem in @xmath52 ( @xcite ) , see @xcite for further details .",
    "let us describe the method for proving theorem [ teoprincipalemorse ] , which also clarifies the differences with the case @xmath43 .    since the solutions @xmath6 are radial , to study the spectrum of the linearized operator @xmath53 we decompose it as a sum of the spectrum of a radial weighted operator and the spectrum of the laplace - beltrami operator on the unit sphere .",
    "to bypass the difficulty of dealing with a weighted eigenvalue problem with a singularity at the origin we approximate the ball @xmath1 by annuli @xmath54 with a small hole , showing that the number of negative eigenvalues of the linearized operator @xmath53 is preserved ( we refer to @xcite for this ) .",
    "then ( see section [ section : approximation ] ) it turns out that the morse index @xmath8 is determined by the _ size _ of the first @xmath55 ( radial ) eigenvalues @xmath56 , @xmath57 , of the weighted operator @xmath58 in @xmath59 , where the potential @xmath60 is @xmath61 and @xmath62 is properly chosen .",
    "+ in order to study these eigenvalues a good knowledge of the potential @xmath60 is needed which , in turns , means to have accurate estimates on the solutions @xmath6 .",
    "this is where the hypothesis on the exponent @xmath10 enters .",
    "+ if @xmath3 , in section [ section : asymptotic2 ] we make a precise analysis of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath6 as @xmath63 , which allows to get the needed estimates on the potential @xmath60 for @xmath10 close to the critical exponent .",
    "in particular we get that suitable rescalings of @xmath6 in each nodal region converge to the same positive radial solution @xmath64 of the critical equation in @xmath2 : @xmath65 this allows to detect precisely the asymptotic behavior , as @xmath63 , of the first eigenvalue @xmath66 ( and then , as a consequence , of all the other eigenvalues @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) by several nontrivial estimates ( see section [ section : asymptotic4 ] ) .",
    "in dimension @xmath45 the procedure followed in @xcite is similar but the striking difference with respect to the case @xmath3 is that the limit problems , as @xmath69 , for the positive and negative part of the nodal radial solutions @xmath6 with @xmath45 nodal domains are different .",
    "indeed it was proved in @xcite that ( assuming w.l.g .",
    "@xmath70 ) a suitable rescaling of @xmath71 converges to a regular solution of the liouville problem in @xmath52 , while a suitable rescaling of @xmath72 converges to a radial solution of a singular liouville problem in @xmath52 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "so the estimates needed to compute the morse index of @xmath6 are completely different and the contribution from the annular nodal region is bigger and makes the morse index of @xmath6 higher with respect to the corresponding case in dimension @xmath3 .",
    "this difference reflects in the study of the asymptotic behavior of the first radial eigenvalue @xmath73 ( see remark [ rmkdifferencen2 ] ) which makes the proof in dimension @xmath14 more delicate than that for @xmath43 .",
    "+ we also point out that the assertion of theorem [ teoprincipalemorse ] holds for radial solutions to with _ any number of nodal regions _ , while in the case @xmath43 the result of @xcite has been obtained only for solutions with @xmath45 nodal regions .",
    "this is because an asymptotic analysis of radial solutions with @xmath74 is lacking in dimension @xmath43 .",
    "we believe that the strategy of the present paper could be pursued also in dimension @xmath43 to get a result for general radial solutions .",
    "we plan to do this in a future paper .",
    "a final comment is that the whole strategy for the morse index computation ( here as in @xcite ) relies on the peculiar behavior of the radial solutions which have all the nodal regions shrinking at the same point as @xmath75 ( as @xmath76 when @xmath43 ) .",
    "this property also induces an interesting blow - up ( in time ) phenomenon in the associated parabolic problem with initial data close to the radial stationary solutions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section [ sectionlowerbounmorse ] by proving a lower bound for the morse index of radial solutions of semilinear elliptic dirichlet problems with general autonomous nonlinearities .",
    "this part holds in any dimension @xmath37 and extends previous results in @xcite giving , as a special case , the estimate . in section [ section : asymptotic2 ]",
    "we perform the asymptotic analysis of the radial solutions of as @xmath63 .",
    "the results in this section are interesting in themselves and do not appear in previous papers . in section [ section :",
    "approximation ] we approximate the eigenvalue problem in the ball by corresponding ones in approximating annuli and set the auxiliary weighted eigenvalue problems . in section [ section : asymptotic4 ] we study the radial eigenvalues of the weighted operator @xmath77 introduced in ; in particular the analysis of the first one @xmath73 is the central part of the section . the delicate estimates that we develop here are crucial for our proof ; in order to obtain them we need to analyze accurately the contribution to the morse index of each nodal region of @xmath6 .",
    "finally the proof of theorem [ teoprincipalemorse ] is presented in section [ section : proofmain ] .",
    "we consider a semilinear elliptic problem with a general autonomous nonlinearity : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath37 is either a ball or an annulus centered at the origin and @xmath80 .    for a solution @xmath81 of",
    "we denote by @xmath82 the _ morse index _ of @xmath81 , namely the number of the negative dirichlet eigenvalues of @xmath83 in @xmath84 ( counted with their multiplicity ) , where @xmath85 is the linearized operator at @xmath81 , namely @xmath86 when the solution @xmath81 is radial we also denote by @xmath87 the _ radial morse index _ of @xmath81 , i.e. the number of negative radial eigenvalues of the linearized operator @xmath88 .",

    "we use the partial derivatives of @xmath96 to produce negative eigenvalues whose corresponding eigenfunctions are odd with respect to an hyperplane passing through the origin .",

    "+ moreover also in the set @xmath137 the function @xmath118 satisfies ( for @xmath138 ) .",
    "hence also in @xmath139 zero is an eigenvalue for @xmath135 with corresponding eigenfunction @xmath118 .",
    "+ in conclusion we have obtained @xmath55 adjacent regions where an eigenvalue of @xmath135 is zero .",
    "this implies that in the domain @xmath140 the @xmath141-th eigenvalue @xmath142 of @xmath135 is zero for some @xmath143 .",
    "+ since @xmath144 is strictly contained in @xmath145 , by construction we have that the @xmath141-th eigenvalue @xmath142 of @xmath135 in @xmath146 is negative for some @xmath143 , in particular @xmath147 in @xmath145 and so are all @xmath148 in @xmath145 for @xmath149 . by reflecting by oddness with respect to @xmath150 the corresponding eigenfunctions we get eigenfunctions of @xmath135 in the whole @xmath84 corresponding to the same @xmath55 negative eigenvalues @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "repeating the same arguments for all @xmath97 we get at least @xmath55 negative eigenvalues @xmath153 in the domains @xmath154 , for each @xmath97 , which give eigenvalues of @xmath135 in the whole @xmath84 whose corresponding eigenfunctions are odd with respect to @xmath101 , @xmath97 . + note that , by symmetry , @xmath155 but the corresponding eigenfunctions are linearly independent , because they are odd with respect to orthogonal axes .",
    "+ so the multiplicity of each eigenvalue @xmath151 of @xmath135 in @xmath84 is at least @xmath156 so that we have got at least @xmath157 negative eigenvalues .",
    "since the eigenfunctions we have found are not radial , adding @xmath158 , we get the estimate .",
