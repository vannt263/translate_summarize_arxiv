    "soon after the discovery of the 126 _ gev _ higgs boson @xcite , @xcite it was pointed out by olesen @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) that a large magnetic field is generated by the quarks producing the higgs boson , and that this magnetic field might influence the decay processes of the higgs boson , and in particular the decay @xmath0 ( a higgs boson decaying to two photons ) .    in the present paper",
    "it is proven that this indeed is the case .",
    "the amplitude for this decay process is considered for the unrealistic case of a stationary homogeneous magnetic field @xmath1 by the method of schwinger @xcite , further developed by adler @xcite and by tsai and erber @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated that the amplitude contains a term proportional to @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) for emission of photons along the field lines , with @xmath4 the fundamental electric charge unit , @xmath5 the _ w_-boson mass and @xmath6 the higgs boson mass .",
    "the amplitude is thus singular at @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the critical field strength where a component of the @xmath9-field becomes tachyonic @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the singularity is caused by this would - be tachyonic field component ( in agreement with olesen s prediction @xcite ) and also by the fact that charged particles only propagate along the field lines , such that their loop feynman integrals are effectively two - dimensional .",
    "the amplitude is exponentially damped for emission of photons not aligned with the magnetic field , and the denominator is modified in this case .",
    "the amplitude of higgs boson decay to two photons was first computed many years ago by ellis , gaillard and nanopoulos @xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the influence of a background field on the amplitude has not been considered before , but the pioneering paper by vanyashin and terentev @xcite dealing with the heisenberg - euler effective action caused by a charged vector field makes it possible to find the behavior of the amplitude in the limit where the photon energies are close to zero , which is only possible with a higgs boson mass also close to zero .",
    "the result described above deals with a more general situation , and the factor @xmath10 makes a direct comparison difficult .",
    "it turns out that the singularity of ( [ manderley ] ) can not be found from the heisenberg - euler effective action .",
    "an issue relevant for the calculation is that of gauge parameter independence , where it recently was shown that the @xmath0 amplitude is the same in all @xmath11-gauges @xcite .",
    "this statement can be extended to a general electromagnetic background field , using methods developed in a recent publication @xcite , but the proof is omitted here because of its excessive length .",
    "it is plausible that a background field does not upset the proof of gauge parameter independence since the leading singularities of propagators at short distances are independent of the background field . in general",
    "one expects gauge parameter independence of the amplitude in a regularization scheme respecting brst invariance ( this can be seen from @xcite , sec . 4 , and also from @xcite ) . with this justification a particular gauge ( the feynman gauge )",
    "is used throughout this paper .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "2 the standard electroweak theory is recapitulated and used to formulate an effective action at one - loop order describing higgs boson decay to two photons in a background electromagnetic field .",
    "formal developments in this construction are dealt with at length in app .",
    "a. it is also demonstrated in sec .",
    "2 how the decay amplitude obtained by dimensional regularization is found from the effective action by the proper - time method , and a heuristic argument is given for ( [ manderley ] ) .",
    "sections 3 and 4 constitute the central part of the paper .",
    "3 contains a derivation of the decay amplitude in a general homogeneous field by the methods of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , while the singular terms in a homogeneous magnetic field are extracted from the amplitude in sec .",
    "b contains material on propagators and the associated kernels relevant for the following sections in the context of proper - time regularization . in app .",
    "c it is proven that the amplitude as well as its singular terms are invariant under gauge transformations of the radiation field .",
    "d. gives details on the connection to the heisenberg - euler effective action @xcite .",
    "finally quark contributions to the amplitude are considered in sec . 5 and found not to give rise to singularities induced by the magnetic field , while the higgs boson self energy is shown in sec . 6 to possess a singularity similar to ( [ manderley ] ) .",
    "the metric is @xmath13    in the standard electroweak theory the scalar lagrangian is , keeping only terms relevant for higgs boson decay to photons , with the higgs boson field denoted @xmath14 , the charged goldstone boson fields @xmath15 and charged vector boson fields @xmath16 : @xmath17 with the coupling constants @xmath18 . by the higgs mechanism one makes the replacement @xmath19 , and @xmath20 get the mass @xmath21 , while the higgs boson mass is @xmath22 .",
    "the covariant derivatives are : @xmath23 with @xmath24 the elementary charge unit , where @xmath25 is the weinberg angle , and with @xmath26 the electromagnetic field .    in order to describe radiation processes",
    "one splits the electromagnetic field @xmath26 : @xmath27 with @xmath26 a background field , and @xmath28 the radiation field , which fulfils the wave equation and has two independent transverse polarizations",

    "the scalar propagator @xmath38 corresponding to the mass @xmath36 is given by : @xmath39 with @xmath40 and with @xmath41 the proper time variable @xcite , @xcite , and : @xmath42 where a primed derivative refers to @xmath43 and where the scalar kernel @xmath44 is defined by : @xmath45    the vector propagator @xmath46 is similarly defined by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the background field strength .",
    "the solution of ( [ magenta ] ) is : @xmath49 with : @xmath50 defining the vector kernel corresponding to the scalar kernel defined by ( [ kenneweg ] ) . the integration path in ( [ ivantaurus ] ) and ( [ timian ] ) can be deformed such that it runs below the real axis or along the negative imaginary axis in the complex @xmath41-plane , provided no field components are tachyonic .",
    "the following ward identities hold for the kernels : @xmath51 since both sides of the two equations obey the same first - order differential equations in @xmath41 with the same boundary conditions ; here was also used : @xmath52 following from the defintion of the covariant derivative and the fact that the background field is a solution of the maxwell equations . from ( [ draw ] ) follows the ward identities of propagators : @xmath53      a background higgs boson field @xmath54 is used here which is on - shell , i.e. @xmath55    the effective action terms determining the @xmath14 decay amplitude at one - loop order in terms of the propagators described previously are determined from ( [ kagemucha ] ) .",
    "one term of the effective action is : @xmath56 which is a seagull term and a derivative coupling term in the way familiar from scalar quantum electrodynamics , with a higgs boson insertion in one propagator .",
    "the remaining effective action terms are ( [ arason])-([frederik ] ) listed in app .",
    "a. remarkably , they can be reduced to a structure similar to ( [ dulwich ] ) , with both scalar and vector internal propagators , and in the latter case also with magnetic moment couplings .",
    "the reduction takes place by means of ( [ ehuduanna ] ) and ( [ ward ] ) .    in ( [ arason ] ) one isolates the following three expressions by insertion of ( [ supergill ] ) : @xmath57 which obviously is similar to ( [ dulwich ] ) , @xmath58 with magnetic moment couplings , and : @xmath59 with a derivative coupling at one vertex and a magnetic moment coupling at the other vertex . adding the rest of ( [ arason ] ) to ( [ ararat])-([frederik ] ) one obtains as shown in app . a : @xmath60 with the same structure as ( [ dulwich ] ) or ( [ laramie ] ) .",
    "a feynman diagram representation of @xmath61 and @xmath62 is given in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .          from ( [ dulwich ] ) and ( [ laramie])-([bedini ] ) the amplitude of the decay of a higgs boson to two photons is found . here and elsewhere in the paper the photon momenta and polarization vectors",
    "are denoted @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "the evaluation is carried out by means of ( [ ivantaurus ] ) , ( [ kenneweg ] ) , ( [ timian ] ) and ( [ ginsberg ] ) .    in the limit where the background field vanishes the contribution from ( [ laramie ] ) to",
    "the amplitude is in the proper - time representation : @xmath67 where the integrations of the proper time @xmath41 are carried out after the integrations of the momentum variable @xmath68 ; the momentum integrations are convergent at nonvanishing values of the proper time . here",
    "a factor @xmath69 is suppressed , with @xmath70 the higgs boson momentum .",
    "after some manipulations one gets from ( [ corydon ] ) , using the mass - shell conditions as well as symmetric integration in four dimensions : @xmath71 in ( [ raketcykel ] ) one uses : @xmath72 and also : @xmath73 evaluating ( [ raketcykel ] ) by ( [ legolas ] ) and ( [ thranduil ] ) one finds that the first two terms cancel out , and ( [ raketcykel ] ) reduces to : @xmath74 the total contribution to the amplitude from ( [ dulwich ] ) , ( [ laramie ] ) and ( [ bedini ] ) is found from ( [ hugodrax ] ) by the substitution : @xmath75    ( [ appalachian ] ) in a vanishing external field contributes to the decay amplitude : @xmath76 ( [ athapaskian ] ) is zero in a vanishing external field .",
    "the decay amplitude with vanishing external field is the sum of ( [ hugodrax ] ) ( with the substitution ( [ hanebane ] ) ) and ( [ ilderpeter ] ) : @xmath77 which is the standard decay amplitude @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is perhaps an interesting point that this result has been obtained by proper - time regularization instead of dimensional regularization ; symmetrical integration in momentum space has been carried out in four dimensions and this is possible because momentum integrals are finite at nonvanishing values of the proper time @xmath41 .    carrying for the sake of argument the integral in ( [ hugodrax ] ) out in two space - time dimensions",
    "one gets , disregarding the dimensional mismatch , the result : @xmath78 this is singular at @xmath79 ; the singularity arises from @xmath80 where the denominator of the integrand is very small at this value of the mass ratio .",
    "this argument gives a heuristic indication of the way in which the square - root singularity of ( [ manderley ] ) arises , since the quasi - tachyonic field component decreases the vector boson mass according to : @xmath81 the complete determination of the singularity takes place in sec .",
    "the @xmath12 amplitude in a non - vanishing homogeneous electromagnetic field is found from ( [ dulwich])-([bedini ] ) by the method of schwinger @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "details on formal tools are relegated to app.b .",
    "the contribution from the first term of ( [ dulwich ] ) to the decay amplitude is by ( [ dynamide ] ) : @xmath82 here one uses ( [ boong ] ) , as well as the eigenvalue equation ( [ lassalle ] ) , to get the following value of ( [ queensland ] ) with a factor @xmath83 suppressed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath84    next the contribution of the second term of ( [ dulwich ] ) to the decay amplitude is evaluated .",
    "it has the proper - time representation : @xmath85 by ( [ trudeau ] ) , and using here ( [ classicgrandcru ] ) and ( [ mahelia ] ) as well as the procedure used above to obtain ( [ plausibel ] ) one finds : @xmath86 and in the last step ( [ trudeau ] ) was used again .",
    "the evaluation of ( [ thorbellinge ] ) is carried out by ( [ trudeau ] ) and ( [ borkrigel ] ) . only terms with two or no @xmath87 operators give a nonvanishing contribution . with no @xmath87 operators",
    "one gets the following contribution from ( [ thorbellinge ] ) : @xmath88 the term of ( [ thorbellinge ] ) with two @xmath87 operators contributes : @xmath89 in both ( [ frodobaggins ] ) and ( [ lashmar ] ) a factor @xmath83 was left out .",
    "the sum of ( [ plausibel ] ) , ( [ frodobaggins ] ) and ( [ lashmar ] ) is invariant under gauge transformations of the polarization vectors .",
    "this follows from the general proof in ( [ skarphedin ] ) ( app .",
    "c ) but can be proven directly also .",
    "( [ plausibel ] ) and ( [ lashmar ] ) are both ultraviolet divergent and can be rearranged in two convergent expressions : @xmath90 and : @xmath91    the contribution of ( [ laramie ] ) to the amplitude is : @xmath92 and is thus determined from ( [ frodobaggins ] ) , ( [ marlash ] ) and ( [ mehemet ] ) by the substitution @xmath93 and insertion of a factor @xmath94 in the integral . also from ( [ bedini ] ) one gets three terms similar to ( [ frodobaggins ] ) , ( [ marlash ] ) and ( [ mehemet ] ) by the substitution @xmath95    for the considerations on a pure magnetic field in the following section it is convenient to isolate in the contribution to the amplitude from ( [ kirsewetter ] ) the following three terms : @xmath96 and also : @xmath97 and : @xmath98 and to further isolate in ( [ hickory ] ) and ( [ donaulloyd ] ) : @xmath99 here was used : @xmath100 and also ( [ octopussy ] ) .",

    "one gets : @xmath102 which after similar manipulations as were used to obtain ( [ plausibel ] ) gives the amplitude term : @xmath103 also ( [ athapaskian ] ) yields : @xmath104 that is evaluated in a similar way , contributing to the amplitude : @xmath105",
    "the @xmath63 decay amplitude is considered in a pure homogeneous magnetic field @xmath1 directed along the positive @xmath106-axis , with @xmath107 .    in this case ( [ ambeno ] ) is , in the special case where the photons are emitted along the magnetic field lines , using also ( [ debeers ] ) combined with ( [ minimal ] ) as well as ( [ macaroni ] ) and ( [ benazir ] ) : @xmath108 ( [ beesiana ] ) is divergent at @xmath109 .",
    "this divergence can be attributed to the quasi - unstable mode of the @xmath20 field that decreases the effective mass of a @xmath20 field component , combined with the fact that the magnetic field in a sense makes the theory two - dimensional since charged field modes only propagate along the field lines .",
    "this can also be seen from ( [ rimelig ] ) , which shows that one finds results similar to ( [ beesiana ] ) redoing the calculation of the integrals determining the amplitude in a vanishing external field in sec .",
    "2.4 in two instead of four dimensions .    in the limit where the photon momenta vanish one",
    "may also obtain the amplitude from the heisenberg - euler effective action .",
    "having vanishing photon momenta one must let the higgs boson mass go to zero as well .",
    "( [ beesiana ] ) then becomes : @xmath110 and the square - root singularity is not visible in this limit .",
    "the divergence arises at @xmath111 in which case the phase factor involving @xmath41 is constant in part of ( [ beesiana ] ) and the @xmath41-integration diverges .",
    "that ( [ beesiana ] ) is singular in this limit can also be seen directly by restricting both the feynman parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 in ( [ beesiana ] ) to a narrow interval around @xmath114 , in which case it is evaluated by the following calculation , with @xmath115 ( cf .",

    "the quantity @xmath127 is given by ( [ rottingham ] ) which is nonlinear in the feynman parameters @xmath128 and @xmath113 , and the calculation is therefore more complicated than ( [ jemogfixiana ] ) .",
    "approximating @xmath127 by the following expression : @xmath129 with @xmath130 the angle between @xmath131 and @xmath132 as defined in ( [ lullubum ] ) , one gets instead of ( [ jemogfixiana ] ) : @xmath133 the power series expansion has been carried out in order to make the @xmath41-integration possible .",

    "consequently the singularity of ( [ zinfandel ] ) is not modified by ( [ hornblower ] ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the singular behavior found in ( [ beesiana ] ) or ( [ jemogfixiana ] ) persists when the two photons produced in the decay also have momentum components orthogonal to the magnetic field , with the square root denominator modified as seen from ( [ zinfandel ] ) and with an exponential damping factor .",
