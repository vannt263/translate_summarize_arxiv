    "two polarimeters are employed at the hera ep storage ring to measure the polarization of its 27.5  gev electron or positron beam .",
    "both instruments are laser backscattering compton devices .",
    "the tpol polarimeter measures the transverse beam polarization by detecting the associated angular anisotropy of the backscattered compton photons .",
    "the original configuration of this instrument has been covered in considerable detail  @xcite and recent upgrades are described in  @xcite .",
    "the lpol polarimeter measures the longitudinal beam polarization between the spin rotators at the hermes experiment by detecting an asymmetry in the energy spectra of the compton photons  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will present the results of an analysis of rise - time calibration data which were collected in 1996/97 .",
    "such measurements are used to determine the absolute polarization scale of the tpol polarimeter .",
    "these results will be compared with earlier tpol calibrations obtained in 1994 and with recent cross calibrations with the lpol polarimeter .",
    "electrons or positrons are injected unpolarized at 12 gev into the hera storage ring and are subsequently ramped to the nominal beam energy of 27.5 gev .",
    "transverse polarization evolves then naturally through the spin flip driven by synchrotron radiation ( the sokolov - ternov effect  @xcite ) with an exponential time dependence    @xmath0    for a circular machine with a perfectly flat orbit the spin vector of the positrons ( electrons ) will be exactly parallel ( antiparallel ) to the direction of the guide field and the theoretical maximum of the polarization has been calculated to be @xmath1 , with an associated rise - time constant    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the lorentz factor , @xmath4 is the radius of curvature of the orbit and the other symbols have the usual meaning .    for rings such as hera with the spin rotators needed to get longitudinal polarization at experiments and/or reversed horizontal bends , @xmath5 can be reduced substantially below @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be modified too , see table 1 .",
    "synchrotron radiation also causes depolarization which competes with the sokolov - ternov effect with the result that the equilibrium polarization is reduced even further .",
    "moreover the depolarization is strongly enhanced by the presence of the small but non - vanishing misalignments of the magnetic elements and the resulting vertical orbit distortions which are typically 1  mm rms .",
    "these effects are treated in the formalism of derbenev and kondratenko @xcite which has been summarized in @xcite .",
    "then the equilibrium polarization and the time constant can be written as    @xmath8 \\ , \\rangle}_s }   \\label{eq : p}\\ ] ]    @xmath9 \\ , \\rangle}_s } \\label{eq : tau}\\ ] ]    where the unit vector @xmath10 describes the polarization direction which is a function of the machine azimuth @xmath11 and the phase space coordinate @xmath12 , the unit vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 describe the magnetic field orientation and the direction of motion , and @xmath15 is the circumference of the machine .",
    "the angular brackets @xmath16 denote an average over phase space at azimuth @xmath11 . the term with @xmath17 accounts for the radiative depolarization due to photon - induced longitudinal recoils and the term with @xmath18 in the numerator of [ eq : p ] arises from the dependence of the radiation power on the spin orientation .",
    "these expressions can be summarized in the scaling relation @xmath19 between the actually observed parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 of equation  [ eq : pol ] and the theoretical values @xmath5 and @xmath7 which are obtained by ignoring terms with @xmath18 in equations [ eq : p ] and [ eq : tau ] . for the hera machine at 27.5",
    "gev they take the values in table 1  @xcite :    .input parameters for rise - time calibrations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for a proper interpretation of the calibration results shown in table  3 , it is important to understand that all tpol polarization values have been scaled by a factor 0.946 since 1996  @xcite in good agreement with the value of 0.951 given here .",
    "the subsequent 1996/97 relative re - calibration factor of 0.999 is therefore equivalent to an overall absolute factor of @xmath22 in relation to the original polarization scale used prior to 1996 .",
    "the analysis of the 1994 rise - time data reported in @xcite assigned an error of 0.032 to the determination of @xmath23 .",
    "the error quoted is the rms @xmath24 of the nearly gaussian distribution of k - measurements .",
    "this rms @xmath24 value describes the typical error of a single measurement of @xmath23 .",
    "the error of the mean value of @xmath23 is then @xmath25 and thus considerably smaller than @xmath26 .    by comparing the calibrations of 1994 and 1996/97",
    ", we find excellent agreement within the given errors of 1.1 and 1.2% .",
    "since the 96/97-calibrations were carried out with activated spin rotators at hermes , in contrast to 1994 when the machine was flat , we can also set an experimental upper limit of about 1.5% on the correction @xmath27 in equation  [ eq : pol - tau ] which accounts for the @xmath28 term in the numerator of equation  [ eq : p ] .",
    "as the magnitude of the polarization at any particular point in time is an invariant around the hera ring , a comparison between the tpol and lpol polarimeters will provide a cross calibration of the instruments , as long as the spin points fully upright at the tpol and longitudinal at the lpol .",
    "although it is well known to the operators of the polarimeters and to the members of hermes that the two instruments appeared to disagree occasionally with each other outside of their quoted errors , it is reassuring to demonstrate a large sample of measurements , covering two months of data taking in april / may of 2000 , which exhibits a consistent and stable performance of both polarimeters .",
    "we have plotted the lpol / tpol ratio for this time period in figure  2 for six different integration times ranging from 1 to 25 minutes .",
    "we obtain a consistent mean ratio of 1.018 with an error of the mean @xmath29 of less than 0.001 .",
    "since the statistical fluctuations are vanishing with higher averaging periods , one can estimate the systematic error of the tpol measurement @xmath30 from the observed rms @xmath31 of the @xmath32 distribution and the quoted lpol systematic error @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "assuming uncorrelated errors for the two polarimeters , we obtain @xmath34^{1/2 } = 1.9\\%$ ] .",
    "the rise - time calibration analysis presented in this article and the lpol / tpol comparison is based on data collected by the hermes polarimeter group .",
