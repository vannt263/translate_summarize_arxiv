    "<S> let us start with describing the partition function for @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function was computed in @xcite and becomes as follows : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are parameters of the standard torus action on @xmath2 , and @xmath5 denotes a scale parameter for the gauge theory . </S>",

    "<S> we remark that any partition @xmath6 can be decomposed into a single partition @xmath7 and @xmath8-tuple partitions @xmath9 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this arises from a division algorithm for the young diagrams analogous to that for integers . </S>",

    "<S> we may write @xmath10 to emphasize the decomposition . </S>",
