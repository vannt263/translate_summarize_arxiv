    "one of such models is the so called hosotani - oda - ohnuma - sakamura ( hoos ) model which is able to fit the measurements of the higgs boson but requires many exotic fermions to do so @xcite .",

    "we work with a slight modification of the hoos model .",
    "we obtain a lr model from this model @xcite where the hosotani scalar is not the higgs boson but one of the scalars that break the lr symmetry .",
    "this scalar is stable and a dark matter candidate .",
    "we add two more scalars on the brane which contribute to lr symmetry breaking , the higgs boson comes from one of them .",
    "this higgs - like boson has modified higgs to gauge boson couplings , with respect to the sm .",
    "all the sm fermions live in the bulk and obtain mass contributions from the higgs boson and the hosotani scalar .",

    "we are free to choose the boundary conditions : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are two @xmath24 matrices , one for each brane , that obey @xmath25 .",
    "the gauge symmetry on the branes will be reduced to the gauge transformations which satisfy : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a gauge transformation from @xmath0 .    we choose @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    ", the broken generators may obtain a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) through the effective potential @xcite .",
    "we may align the vev with a specific generator @xmath32 so the scalar that obtains a vev can be written as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a dimensionless scalar and @xmath35 is its fifth dimensional profile , normalized as @xmath36 .    now let s study the transformation @xmath37 that belongs to the broken generator of the group and changes @xmath38 .",
    "we see that for specific values of @xmath39 this may be a symmetry of the model if it satifies eq.([orsim ] ) . in general",
    "this will be a symmetry for @xmath40 , hence the name of hosotani phase for @xmath41 .",
    "since we are working only with tensorial representations of @xmath42 , it is enough for @xmath43 to be a symmetry of the system .",

    "this means that the mass term that comes from the brane will have additional input from the profiles after normalizing the four - dimensional fields .",
    "luckily the profiles of the w and z in the fifth dimension are practically constant and there is not much input from them to the mass parameter nor to the charged currents @xcite .",
    "the vev coming from the hosotani mechanism may be aligned so that the mixing terms between @xmath69 and @xmath70 are practically zero @xcite .",
    "the masses for the w and z are given just like in a thdm with @xmath71 and the weinberg angle has its value fixing the coupling constant of @xmath72 .",
    "due to h - parity there are no mixing terms between scalars .",
    "since the @xmath48 scalar breaks the symmetry in the bulk , it contains the goldstone bosons so we work with it as : @xmath73 where the extra @xmath74 comes from the hosotani mechanism and @xmath75 is the remaining neutral scalar field in @xmath48 ( to be called hosotani scalar too for the remaining of the paper ) .    compactifying the extra dimension breaks 5d vectors into 4d vectors and scalars .",

    "[ fig : dec ] we plot the @xmath108 brs varying the coupling of the scalars @xmath116 .",

    "we obtain the br for the @xmath118 compared to the sm ones as : @xmath119 consistent with current measurements @xcite .",
    "every fermion receives mass contributions from both scalars , depending on its kink mass parameter @xmath19 and its coupling to the left scalar : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the hosotani mechanism s contribution to the tau s mass and @xmath122 is it s usual yukawa coupling .",
    "this , in principle , leaves free the fermion - higgs coupling @xmath122 and can account for the small differences in couplings coupling detected in recent experiments @xcite .    since we have an effective thdm we need to make sure that the extra scalars do nt generate excessive flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) .",
    "the most stringent constraints for fcncs come from the decay @xmath123 in the lepton sector and @xmath124 mixing in the quark sector @xcite .",

    "this constraint fixes the third family yukawa couplings to be sm - like , agreeing with recent measurements , and leaves some freedom in the first family yukawa couplings .    the gauge boson s kk modes are another important source of fcncs . in this model ,",
    "these are sufficiently lowered by the rs - gim mechanism @xcite and with the used value of @xmath104 we can avoid constraints .",

    "this results in a practically flat fifth dimensional profile for all fermions , strongly reducing fcncs coming from any kk gauge boson .",
    "the decay of @xmath108 to photons is enhanced by the charged scalar and the different couplings to fermions and @xmath105 boson , with the setup given above , we obtain a br compared to the sm : @xmath129 consistent with experimental data @xcite .      as we have showed above",
    ", the geometry of the extra dimension and its compactification give us a residual symmetry , the h parity .",
    "the hosotani scalar is odd under h parity , and everything else is even , thus the hosotani scalar is completely stable .",

    "we now analyze its relic density and its cross section with nucleons .    the interaction of the hosotani scalar with fermions , at tree level ,",
    "is only mediated by the left scalar .",

    "gauge higgs unification proposes that the higgs boson comes from the higher dimensional components of a gauge field .",
    "this idea needs too many extra fields to work , so in our model it is not the higgs boson the one that comes from ghu , this boson becomes dark matter .",
    "we have a slight modification of the hoos model with gauge symmetry based on the group @xmath0 and it lives in the rs spacetime .",
    "the gauge symmetry is broken to @xmath133 via orbifolding , and we have a custodial symmetry that helps to comply with electroweak precision tests .",
    "after compactification the higher dimensional components of the gauge fields behave as a scalar that obtains a vev through the hosotani mechanism .",
    "this hosotani scalar is one of the scalar fields that break the lr symmetry but not the higgs boson , as in usual ghu .",
    "furthermore , due to symmetries of the model , it is stable and therefore a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "there are two additional scalar fields , charged under @xmath134 that live on the ir brane and obtain a vev , breaking the lr symmetry .",
    "the left doublet contains the higgs boson and we fit its observables to the measured ones .",
    "the fact that these scalars live on the ir brane of the rs spacetime solve the hierarchy problem .    the @xmath135 symmetry breaks at the 10 tev scale leaving effectively , at low energies , a thdm with @xmath63 gauge symmetry , whose scalar sector contains a charged scalar and pseudoscalar within experimental constraints .",
    "all the fermion content of the sm lives on the bulk .",
    "these fermions receive their mass from a combination of both , the hosotani mechanism and the left scalar vev .",
    "the model has fcncs generated by kk gauge bosons and the effective thdm .",
    "these can be made sufficiently small to comply with experimental constraints .",
    "we showed that the hosotani scalar is completely stable , it has a very small cross section and it can have the necessary relic density to be an interesting dark matter candidate .",
    "we have been able to fit all the sm observables , including recent measurements from the higgs boson .",
