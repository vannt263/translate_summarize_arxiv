    "although the schrdinger equation was proposed as early as in 1926 , its exact solution ( by means of the full configuration interaction , fci ) for the quantum mechanical many - body system is still hopeless except for the smallest system due to the combinatorial computational cost .",
    "the mean - field theory has been a great success in describing the microscopic systems , such as the nuclei , the atoms , and the molecules .",
    "the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation , as the best mean - field method , has played a central role in understanding interacting many - body quantum systems in all fields of physics . however , the hfb wave functions are far from the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and the effects that go beyond mean - field are missing .",
    "post - hfb treatments ( beyond - mean field methods ) , such as the configuration interaction(ci ) , the generator coordinate method(gcm ) , and the symmetry restoration , are expected to improve the wave functions and present better description of the quantum mechanical many - body systems .",
    "for instance , symmetry restoration of the hfb states has been performed not only in the nuclei ( e.g.@xcite ) , but also in the molecules(e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , symmetry restoration also improves the descriptions of quantum dots and ultra - cold bose systems in the condense matter world@xcite .",
    "the overlaps and the matrix elements of the hamiltonian between the hfb states are basic blocks to establish such post - hfb calculations . efficient evaluating of those quantities is of extreme importance to implement the post - hfb calculations .",
    "efforts have been devoted to finding convenient formulae for such matrix elements and overlaps for decades .",
    "the onishi formula @xcite is the first expression of the overlap between two different hfb vacua , but the sign of the overlap is not determined .",
    "many works have been done to overcome this sign problem @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", robledo made the final solution and proposed a new formula using the pfaffian rather than the determinant .",
    "after that , overlaps between quasi - particle states have been intensively studied , which are also based on the pfaffian @xcite .",
    "it is realized that overlaps between multi - quasiparticle hfb states , originally evaluated with the generalized wick s theorem(gwt)@xcite , can be equivalently calculated by compact formulae with pfaffian@xcite .",
    "thanks to the same mathematical structure of the pfaffian and the gwt , the combinatorial explosion is avoided .",
    "we also should mention that , before robledo s work @xcite , there is another compact formula for the gwt @xcite .",
    "it is obtained by using gaudin s theorem in the finite - temperature formalism , but not expressed with the pfaffian .",
    "although the overlap between hfb states can be quickly calculated using the proposed pfaffian formulae or the method in @xcite to avoid the combinatorial explosion , one may certainly encounter another difficulty in evaluating the matrix elements of many - body operators , which has never been treated .",
    "we address this problem as follows . in the representation of second quantization , one can write the one - body operator @xmath0 and two - body operator @xmath1 as @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the creation and annihilation operators of the spherical harmonic oscillator , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 stands for the true vacuum . here , we assume all operators are defined in the same @xmath7dimensional fock space .",
    "the matrix element of an operator @xmath8(@xmath9 or @xmath1 ) with multi - quasiparticle excitations is generally given as @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for a unitary transformation .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are different normalized hfb vacua . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are corresponding quasiparticle operators with @xmath16 for any @xmath17 .",
    "conventionally , the matrix element in eq.([o ] ) can be obtained in two steps .",
    "the first step is evaluating the matrix element of each @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) in eq.([o1 ] ) [ or eq.([o2 ] ) ] through pfaffian or the method in ref @xcite to avoid the combinatorial explosion .",
    "the second step is collecting all the @xmath18 ( or @xmath20 ) matrix elements to get the final value of eq.([o ] ) .",
    "unlike the overlap between hfb states , each matrix element of eq.([o])(with @xmath21 ) requires the summation over @xmath22 .",
    "this is too much time consuming for a symmetry restoration in a relatively large configuration space , where thousands or millions of the matrix elements need to be calculated at each mesh point in the integral of the projection .",
    "such calculations in a large fock space will be even too expensive to be tractable .    in this letter , we present new formulae for evaluating the matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ o ] ) between arbitrary hfb states , which are in compact forms and may greatly reduce the computational cost of the post - hfb calculations .",
    "let s start with a useful equation that the expectation value of a product of arbitrary single - fermion operators , @xmath23 , is given by the pfaffian of all possible contractions @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a @xmath26 skew - symmetric matrix with the matrix element @xmath27 .",
    "one can extend eq .",
    "( [ m0 ] ) to a more general form ( details of proof are given in the supplemental material to this article ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) can be regarded as the true vacuum or arbitrary hfb vacuum .",
    "@xmath31 is a @xmath32 skew - symmetric matrix , but the matrix element in the upper triangular is @xmath33 for the lower triangular of @xmath31 , @xmath34 .",
    "attention must be payed to the useless contraction @xmath35 , which never appears in the gwt and should not be taken as @xmath36 . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath37 is nonzero , and can be evaluated by the available formulae proposed by several authors @xcite .    here",
    ", we define the hfb vacuum @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) as @xmath40 where @xmath41is the normalization factor of @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath42 is the number of @xmath43 operators acting on @xmath6 to form the hfb vacuum @xmath38 .",
    "the operator @xmath44 can be expressed in terms of either @xmath45 or @xmath46 , @xmath47 we should stress that the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) are arbitrary , which means @xmath23 can stand for any single - fermion operator , such as @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , or even @xmath58 , @xmath59 , etc . for instance , if @xmath60 , then @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the operators ( @xmath52 , @xmath63 ) , ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) and ( @xmath64 , @xmath57 ) do obey the fermion - commutation relations , but the general operator @xmath23 does not have any constraint .",
    "hence , we do not impose @xmath65 . by assuming the unitary transformation between @xmath66 and @xmath67 being",
    "@xmath68 one can obtain the explicit expressions of @xmath69 in the following three equivalent forms ( see details in supplemental material ) , @xmath70_{ij},\\\\ \\label{sijb } \\mathbb{s}_{ij}&=&[a^a\\mathbb{x}^{-1}b^{bt}]_{ij},\\\\ \\label{sijc } \\mathbb{s}_{ij}&=&[a^bb^{bt}+b^b\\mathbb{y}^*\\mathbb{x}^{-1}b^{bt}]_{ij},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the existence of the matrix @xmath71 is guaranteed by the assumption @xmath72 , according to the onishi formula @xcite , in which @xmath73 .",
    "note that eq.([m ] ) can be regarded as a generalization of the conclusion proposed recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of eq.([o ] ) can be rewritten in a general form @xmath74 where @xmath75 instead of directly using eq.([i ] ) . here ,",
    "we denote @xmath76 as @xmath77 for @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "to establish the notation , we define the following matrix elements of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 where the shapes of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .    for the one - body operator @xmath0 , we denote the quantity @xmath86 and the matrix @xmath87 using above notations , @xmath88 similar to the laplace expansion for determinant , there is also a general expansion formula for pfaffian ( lemma 4.2 in ref @xcite , or lemma 2.3 in ref.@xcite ) . due to the same mathematical structure of the gwt and pfaffian ,",
    "this pfaffian expansion is essentially equivalent to the contraction role of the gwt .",
    "we present several explicit expansions of pfaffian in the supplemental material , and using the one with respect to two rows ( eq.(s40 ) in supplemental material ) to get @xmath89 where @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 . here and below",
    ", we denote @xmath94 as a sub - matrix of @xmath31 obtained by removing the rows and columns of @xmath17,@xmath95,@xmath96 .",
    "the indexes @xmath97 are different from each other by definition .",
    "thus we may set @xmath98 , and hope this does not confuse the readers .    if @xmath99 , then @xmath100 exists .",
    "pf@xmath101 can be expressed with pf@xmath102 and some matrix elements of @xmath100 through the pfaffian version of lewis carroll formula@xcite .",
    "an alternative form of this formula has been given by mizusaki and oi@xcite in the study of hfb matrix elements .",
    "some explicit expressions for this formula are given in the supplemental material .",

    "if @xmath100 does not exist , eq.([ia4 ] ) is invalid , but one can compact eq.([ia2 ] ) to @xmath105 where the skew - symmetric matrices @xmath106 are the same as @xmath31 but the matrix elements in the @xmath17-th row and column @xmath107 .",
    "[ we set @xmath108 due to @xmath109 in eq.([ia2 ] ) ] .",

    "eq.([ib2 ] ) clearly shows the contraction role of the gwt .    in analogy to eq.([ia4 ] ) , if @xmath99 , by replacing @xmath103 and @xmath114 using the pfaffian version of lewis carroll formula ( eq.(s54 ) and eq.(s55 ) in supplemental material ) , one can simplify eq.([ib2 ] ) as @xmath115.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , if @xmath116 , like eq.([ia3 ] ) , eq.([ib2 ] ) can be compacted to @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the same as @xmath106 but @xmath87 is replaced by @xmath119 .",

    "all the above formulae are based on the assumption @xmath123 .",
    "however , the case of @xmath124 that leads to the well known egido pole @xcite should be carefully studied .",
    "in this situation , eq.([m ] ) is invalid and eq.([m0 ] ) should be used . by inserting eq.([phi ] ) into eq.([i ] ) , and regarding all @xmath125 and @xmath126 as @xmath44 , one can rewrite @xmath76 as @xmath127 which is similar to eq.([i ] ) , but @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "although @xmath76 can be directly calculated with eq.([m0 ] ) or the formulae in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , one can also derive corresponding compact forms in this situation . replacing @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath6 ,",
    "it is seen all the above derived formulae from eq.([sc ] ) to eq.([ib3 ] ) are valid because @xmath130 .",
    "but , the matrix @xmath31 becomes @xmath25 , whose shape is @xmath131 , and much larger than the @xmath132 dimension of @xmath31 .",

    "( [ ib4 ] ) is studied and the results are shown in fig.[time ] .",

    "this implies eq.([ib4 ] ) can be very conveniently extended to large model spaces .",
    "in contrast , the conventional method requires a time @xmath145 which highly depends on the model space due to the four - fold summation in eq.([o2 ] ) . testing calculations",

    "moreover , @xmath139 is not included in @xmath137 and should be separately considered . fortunately",

    ", it looks that @xmath158 at large @xmath135 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath159 the dimension of the @xmath79 matrix , and the global efficiency of eq.([ib4 ] ) relative to the conventional method can be evaluated through @xmath160 .",
    "suppose @xmath161 , @xmath162 can be easily in the order of @xmath163 .    in fig.[time](d ) , the cpu time , @xmath139 is within several seconds for @xmath164 , calculations may be implemented when one directly uses eq.([o2 ] ) , as is also taken in the standard @xmath7scheme shell model methods .",
    "however , @xmath139 can drastically increase with @xmath135 bigger and bigger .",
    "therefore , for heavy nuclei , one has to seek a more concise form of two - body interaction , such as separable interactions @xcite , instead of directly using eq.([o2 ] ) . for instance",
    ", the projected shell model ( psm ) uses the quadruple plus pairing interaction .",
    "the present method may be conveniently applied to develop the psm , so that it may includes the states with more quasiparticles(e.g . , 6-q.p . , 8-q.p . ,",
    "in this letter , we focused on the matrix elements of one - body and two - body physical operators between arbitrary hfb states .",
    "the formula of eq.([m0 ] ) , used by bertsch and robledo @xcite , has been extended to evaluate the matrix element of a product of single - fermion operators between two arbitrary hfb vacua [ see eq.([m ] ) ] .",
    "start from eq.([m ] ) , the matrix elements of physical operators have been successfully transformed into compact forms .",
    "formulae for the pf@xmath165 case have also been given .",
    "besides , the case of the egido pole with @xmath124 has been discussed . testing calculations for the two - body operator matrix elements show that the new formulae can easily be in several orders faster than the conventional method .",
    "thus those hopeless beyond mean field calculations for heavy nuclei in a large fock space may be implemented by using the present method .    * acknowledgements * z.g",
