    "there is nowadays a revival of the critical systems which are interesting to study confinement problems @xcite , critical casimir @xcite , and out of equilibrium properties after a quench at the critical point @xcite .",
    "binary mixtures are quite useful and interesting for studying these problems because the demixing transition presents a critical point which belongs to the ising 3d universality class .",
    "binary mixtures close to their critical point can also be used to tune thermally and reversibly the colloid - colloid and colloid - substrate interactions when colloids are suspended in such a mixture @xcite .    for these reasons and the above mentioned applications , it is useful to have several well characterized mixtures which allow the tuning of the experimental parameters .",
    "this study has been motivated by the fact that for our applications we need a mixture with a rather large correlation length , but with a low viscosity , to have quite fast demixing and remixing .",
    "thus we choose a polymer solvent mixture : polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) and 3-octanone .",
    "this solvent has the advantage of having a low evaporation rate compared to other often used solvents such as cyclohexane or methylcyclohexane .",
    "this mixture has an upper critical transition temperature , being homogeneous at high temperature and demixing in a polymer rich phase and a polymer poor phase at low temperature .",
    "it has the advantage of having a critical temperature not too far from room temperature and it has already been characterized by xia _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite in a wide range of molecular weights going from 26 900 g / mol to 596 000 g / mol .",
    "the pmma molecular mass we work with is different from the ones they measured .",
    "thus we did turbidity measurements to check the coexistence diagram of the mixture and locate the critical concentration .",
    "our main interest is in measuring precisely the correlation length @xmath4 and the critical temperature @xmath1 , for our applications of this mixture",
    ". therefore we perform static light scattering measurements .",
    "we obtain @xmath8 with @xmath9 the reduced temperature : @xmath10 . in the explored temperature range",
    "the scaling behaviour corresponds to the ising 3d model with @xmath11 .",

    "the article is organized as follow .",
    "we describe first the experimental set up and the methods .",
    "then we use turbidity data to get the coexistence curve of pmma-3-octanone mixture . in section",

    "3-octanone ( sup . 98% ) is purchased from sigma - aldrich .",
    "polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) is also purchased from sigma - aldrich ( fluka , analytical standard , for gcp ) with a molecular weight @xmath14 g@xmath15mol and a polydispersity @xmath16 .",
    "this molecular weight has been chosen because of its small polydispersity and the quite low viscosity of the mixture .",
    "it is in the molecular weight range studied by xia _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , therefore we estimate @xmath17  k and @xmath18 % for the chosen molecular weight by linear interpolation between the molecular weights 48 600 g / mol and 95 000 g / mol used by ref .",

    "we prepared different volume fractions from 6 % to 16  % in polymer .",
    "the solutions are made under a laminar flow hood . in order to obtain a given volume fraction ,",
    "the polymer is weighted before adding a volume of 3-octanone calculated from the density of the polymere @xmath19 given by the supplier .",
    "the solution is then mixed at 325 k during one night to ensure a good dissolution .      for the turbidity measurements ,",
    "the sample is a thin mixture layer between two glass plates , 1 mm thick .",
    "the thickness of the liquid layer is 150 @xmath20 m , except for solutions having a polymer fraction of 16% .",
    "indeed , the solution becomes very viscous at high polymer fraction and increasing the thickness of the turbidity cells to 250 @xmath20 m is necessary to be able to fill them completely without leaving bubbles .",
    "the cell s thickness is fixed by five polycarbonate spacers ( see fig .",
    "1 ) glued with noa 81 . since octanone is a very reactive solvent , especially with polymers and glues , we tested different kind of glues and concluded that the more appropriate glue is uv - insulated noa 81 .",
    "so we prepare our cell with only two small openings , put araldite on the long sides where there is no opening , and insert the mixture between the plates with a syringe .",
    "then we close the two openings with noa 81 , and harden it during typically 20 seconds under a very intense uv source ( opticure 4 t ) .",
    "finally we add araldite on the noa 81 .",
    "noa 81 , hardened in presence of octanone , and araldite are still slightly porous to octanone , so we can use our cells during only 3 weeks before seeing bubbles due to octanone evaporation . with pure octanone",
    ", we have to modify the cell to have only one deep opening and keep an air bubble between octanone and noa 81 , otherwise noa 81 is dissolved in octanone before polymerizing .",
    "if the volume of the bubble is small enough , then density variations with temperature do not induce flows in the cell .",
    "this has been checked using optical microscopy .",
    "a red laser beam from a laser diode at 632.8 nm crosses the sample as shown on fig [ schematurbidite ] , and the transmitted intensity is measured with a photodiode connected to a computer via a ni usb-6009 card .",
    "the sample is horizontal so we avoid any gravity effect .",
    "the sample s temperature is regulated by an instec cell and temperature controller ( mk1000 ) , modified at the lab .",
    "we use a water circulation to keep the frame of the instec cell at 289  k as a cold point for fast quenches .",
    "the mk1000 has a thermometer under the sample and we add a pt100 probe glued on the top glass plate of the sample ( see fig .",
    "[ schematurbidite ] ) , which is on the opposite side to the heating resistor .",
    "this pt100 is calibrated thanks to an aoip php601 thermometer connected to a calibrated reference pt100 probe purchased from aoip .",
    "we measure the temperature and the temperature gradient in our sample .",
    "the temperature stability of the cell is better than 0.02  k. the maximum temperature difference between the bottom and the top of the sample is 0.63 k when the sample is cooled at 5 k / min , which is our faster ramp speed . at",
    "0.01 k / min , the temperature difference between the top and the bottom is smaller than 0.15 k. since the thickness of the glass plates ( 1 mm each ) is much larger than that of the sample we assume that the sample temperature is homogeneous over its thickness .",
    "we perform a series of different temperature ramps going down from 303.5 k or 311.5 k ( depending on the concentration studied ) to 293.5 k or 301.7 k at rates varying from 5 k / min to 0.01 k / min . before each ramp",
    "the sample is maintained at the highest temperature during one hour which is enough to allow homogeneous mixing on our small volume .",
    "after the ramp we let the sample evolve at the lowest temperature during one or two hours before increasing temperature again .",
    "the volume fraction of pmma in octanone used in the light scattering experiment is 12.8 % _ ie _ the critical concentration deduced from xia _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the pmma - octanone solution is put in a cylindrical glass cell of inner diameter @xmath21 0.02 mm .",
    "the cell is closed with a teflon cap to avoid cap dissolution from octanone vapor .",
    "since the cap is not perfectly airtight , the sample is replaced every week , using the same batch of solution .",
    "we perform static light scattering using a malvern autosizer 4700 spectrometer@xcite with a green laser beam at @xmath22  nm .",
    "we let the laser stabilize more than one hour before starting the measurements .",
    "the sample cell is immersed in a decaline bath ensuring both an optical index matching with the glass tube and temperature stabilization . for temperature control , the decaline bath is surrounded by a water circulation connected to a thermostated bath . the temperature stability is better than 0.02  k. the temperatures we indicate in the following are measured in the decaline bath , and calibrated with the aoip reference pt100 probe . at the beginning of the experiment ,",
    "the bath temperature is set at @xmath23  319  k ( @xmath24 12 k ) so that the solution remains in an homogeneous state .",
    "the temperature is then slowly decreased by steps .",
    "for each temperature step , the solution is left to equilibrate at constant temperature for 40  min before starting the data acquisition .",
    "the scattered intensity is then recorded as a function of the scattering angle @xmath25 for angles varying between 15@xmath26 and 150@xmath26 .",
    "each spectrum is measured four times , and these four spectra are averaged .",
    "the temperature is then decreased toward the next step during a 20  min temperature ramp .",
    "the data treatment follows the ones done by @xcite .",
    "the scattering vector @xmath27 is calculated as usual : @xmath28 with @xmath29 the refractive index of octanone ( @xmath29  =  1.41 ) , @xmath30  =  532  nm the incident laser wavelength and @xmath25 the scattering angle .",
    "the acquired intensity @xmath31 is already corrected for the diffraction volume term @xmath32 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the data should also be corrected for 1 ) background noise , 2 ) geometrical aberrations , 3 ) attenuation due to the sample s turbidity , 4 ) dust and stray light .",
    "we first subtract the background intensity @xmath33 ( measured with the laser off ) to all our measured intensities . in order to correct the possible geometrical aberrations of the spectrometer",
    ", we measure the scattered intensity of toluene @xmath34 at 298 k. the structure factor of the toluene being flat on our @xmath27-range , the variation of the measured intensity with @xmath27 is due to geometrical aberrations of the spectrometer .",
    "we adjust it by a linear fit and divide all the rough intensities by the corresponding values .",
    "then we obtain : @xmath35    in order to correct our data for attenuation , we can not use the previous turbidity measurements with the red laser because turbidity depends on the wavelength of the incident light .",
    "so we replace the cylindrical cell in the light scattering setup by a square hellma cell of side @xmath36  mm , filled with the same sample .",
    "we measure the transmitted light power @xmath37 at @xmath38 with a thorlabs pm100d powermeter , following the same temperature steps as in the light scattering measurements .",
    "the measured light power varies from 50 @xmath20w at @xmath23  319  k to a few @xmath20w at 0.1  k above @xmath1 , with a background of 0.02  @xmath20w .",
    "we normalize all the intensities to the highest temperature value @xmath39 and fit them using : @xmath40 and get @xmath41 , @xmath42 k and @xmath43  k. we use here a phenomenological expression that fits well our turbidity data especially at low temperature .",
    "we did not use eq .",
    "[ tau ] because we do not have the relation between the correlation length @xmath4 and the temperature at this stage of the study . in any case we checked _",
    "a posteriori _ that the result are not affected by the particular form chosen to fit the intensity data .",
    "from this fit , we compute the turbidity @xmath44 with @xmath45 the side of the hellma square cell . after the background and geometrical aberrations corrections ,",
    "the intensity is multiplied by @xmath46 to compensate for attenuation within the experimental cell of diameter @xmath47 .",
    "this correction works for single scattering but fails in case of multiple scattering , when the optical depth @xmath48 becomes higher than one@xcite . because of the critical opalescence of our sample , which becomes highly turbid close to the critical point , this attenuation correction works only for @xmath49  0.4",
    "k. corrections for multiple scattering are very delicate @xcite and not done here . finally , we correct for the potential dust and stray light by subtracting the high temperature intensity . we obtain the intensity @xmath50",
    "in order to determine the coexistence curve of the pmma - octanone mixture , we perform turbidity measurements on seven solutions of different concentrations . the ramp rates evolve from 5 k / min ( which is to fast to allow temperature equilibration in the thickness of the sample ) to 0.01  k / min . this is the slowest temperature rate that can be set on our temperature controller .",
    "note that a 10 k ramp at this rate takes 17 hours .    on fig .",
    "[ hysteresis]-a we show that far away from the critical point ( in concentration ) we have a quite large hysteresis on the transmitted intensity during a temperature cycle .",
    "hysteresis is defined as the temperature difference between the increasing temperature ramp an the decreasing one , at half of the intensity decrease .",
    "the hysteresis decreases when the ramp rate decreases ; it varies from about 2 k at 1 k / min ramp rate ( at the half height of the intensity growth ) to less than 0.3  k at 0.01 k / min .    very close to the critical point",
    ", we also observe an hysteresis in the transmitted intensity during a temperature cycle , but in that case the hysteresis increases when the ramp rate decreases as shown on fig .",
    "[ hysteresis]-b .",
    "moreover , the evolution of the transmitted intensity can be influenced by very slow kinetic effects induced by the divergence of the relaxation time and of the correlation length at the critical point .",
    "an oscillation of the transmitted light sometimes appears at low cooling rate ( see figs .  [ hysteresis]-b and [ rampdown ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a phenomenon reported by d. vollmer _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and explained in references@xcite .",
    "the main idea is that at slow cooling rate , instead of following the binodal equilibrium composition , the composition oscillates between the binodal and spinodal line . if the droplet nucleation ( driven or not by gravity ) is fast enough compared to the cooling rate , the medium can become more transparent before darkening again when the composition crosses the spinodal line and transits again .",
    "+    we can define two transition temperatures : one when the temperature goes up @xmath51 and one when the temperature goes down @xmath52 . at high temperature ,",
    "the homogeneous initial state is always the same while the heterogeneous low temperature state depends strongly on the previous ramp rate and the waiting time at this state . as a consequence we choose to focus on the @xmath52 transition temperature .",
    "there are several manners to define @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite determined the cloud point from the breakpoint of the intensity vs. time curve .",
    "but for our data , the decreasing of intensity is not sharp enough to set @xmath52 that way .",
    "@xcite used the criterion of 10 % reduction in transmittance to define @xmath52 .",
    "this method is quite sensitive to noisy data and is only suitable if the decreasing slopes of the intensity vs. temperature curve for each concentration are approximately equal .",
    "as it is not the case here , we prefer to define @xmath52 as the interception of the straight line defined by the average value of the plateau at high temperature , and the line defined by a linear fit of the decreasing slope between 5 % and 15 % reduction in transmittance .",
    "this procedure is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ rampdown ] .      from the transition temperatures",
    "@xmath52 measured at different concentrations , we built the coexistence curve of the pmma-3-octanone binary mixture on fig [ coexistencecurve ] . on this curve",
    "we can not separate the binodal and spinodal curves .",
    "when we measure the @xmath52 transition temperature we do not exactly know the mechanism of the transition .",
    "all we can say is that close to the critical point , we have a spinodal decomposition followed by the phenomenon of oscillating demixing described in [ transitionturbidite ] .",
    "of course , microscopy gives us a direct view of the demixing process but the technique is limited by the optical resolution of the microscope _ ie _ a few micrometers , so that the transition is detected later than with our turbidity measurement .",
    "slow kinetic effects and oscillating demixing result in a relatively important dispersion of the measured transition temperatures near the critical point .",
    "therefore , we can not simply realize different concentrations around the critical point and choose the one which has the highest transition temperature at the slowest ramp rate .",
    "instead , we choose to determine the critical point by using all the concentrations we measured and fitting our temperatures by a parabolic evolution in concentration .",
    "this method has the advantage to be less sensitive to the way the system takes through demixing and to take into account all the data we have collected .",
    "this implies that the coexistence curve is symmetric around the critical point , which has already been shown by xia _",
    "we fitted the data corresponding to the two slowest ramps ( 0.01  k / min and 0.05  k / min ) or to the three slowest ramps ( adding 0.1 k / min ) and get the values : @xmath53  % , @xmath54  k and @xmath55 12.6  % , @xmath56  k respectively .",
    "these values of the critical concentration @xmath57 are compatible with the value @xmath58 % infered from the work of xia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which is the reason why we choose to use the latter concentration for the light scattering measurements .",
    "our critical temperature is 2.42 k smaller than that in ref@xcite .",
    "this may come from its great sensibility to the smallest amount of impurities in the mixture .",
    "we did not use the same pmma and octanone as xia _",

    "the values of the exponents @xmath69 and @xmath64 are compatible with the ising 3d model and we did not find any indication of the crossover between the critical behaviour and the mean - field behaviour , however this is not surprising considering our @xmath9 range .",
    "the @xmath13 values we found is 30 % higher than the value from xia _ et al .",
    "_ , obtained by turdidity measurements .",
    "_ found the same difference on a pdms - pems mixture @xcite , so we think that this results from a bias of the chosen method",
    ". we believe static light scattering is a more reliable and precise method to get a correlation length because it is based on large @xmath27-range measurements , that are less affected by multiple light scattering than @xmath27 = 0 measurements .",
    "it also has the big advantage to allow simultaneously an independent measure of @xmath1 and @xmath13 .    if we compare the @xmath13 value of pmma - octanone to different other mixtures , we find that it is an interesting mixture having a high @xmath13 with a quite small molecular mass of the polymer and a low viscosity solvent .",
    "this makes pmma - octanone a very versatile mixture for future applications .",
