    "@xcite have been expanded to develop a family of synthesized , remote programmable dual - color balanced sis receivers . to this effect",
    "four tunerless balanced - input waveguide receivers have been developed to cover the important 180@xmath0720  ghz frequency range @xcite .",
    "the new heterodyne facility instrumentation allows dual - frequency ( two - color ) observations in the 230/460  ghz and 345/660  ghz atmospheric windows .",
    "the 230/460 balanced receiver system has been installed and is operational at the observatory since may 2012 .",
    "unfortunately , deployment of the 345/650 balanced receiver(s ) is presently on hold due to funding difficulties .",
    "dual - frequency observation is an important mode of operation offered by the new facility instrumentation .",
    "dual band observations are accomplished by separating the horizontal ( h ) and vertical ( v ) polarizations of the incoming signal and routing them via folded optics to the appropriate polarization sensitive balanced mixer .",
    "scientifically this observation mode facilitates pointing for the higher receiver band under mediocre weather conditions and a doubling of scientific throughput under good weather conditions .",
    "balanced configurations were chosen for their inherent local oscillator ( lo ) spurious tone and amplitude ( am ) noise cancellation properties .",
    "( it was also judged to be an optimal compromise between scientific merit and finite funding ) .",
    "unique to the cso , wide rf bandwidth is favored @xcite , allowing the same science to be done with fewer instruments . in all",
    "the upgrade covers alma bands  5@xmath09 .    in principle",
    ", the balanced receiver configuration has the advantage that common mode amplitude noise in the local oscillator system is canceled , while at the same time utilizing all available lo power .",
    "both of these features afford automation over unprecedented wide rf bandwidth , covering the entire 180@xmath0720  ghz submillimeter atmospheric windows with just four los .",
    "receiver noise temperatures and in situ measured instrumental allan variance stability times are excellent and are consistent with the use of balanced receiver technology .",
    "the sis junctions are capable of a 13  ghz bandwidth , though due to band limiting isolators and low noise amplifiers the operational if bandwidth of the cso receivers is presently 4@xmath08  ghz .",
    "to maximize the rf bandwidth , we explore the use of high - current - density aln - barrier sis technology combined with a broad bandwidth full - height waveguide to thin - film microstrip transition @xcite . compared to alo@xmath2-barriers ,",
    "advantages of aln tunnel barriers are a low @xmath3rc product ( increased rf bandwidth ) and enhanced chemical robustness .",
    "even if optimal rf bandwidth is not a requirement , a low @xmath3rc product provides a more homogeneous frequency response and increased tolerance to errors in device fabrication .    to process the required if bandwidth",
    ", the cso has acquired a fast fourier transformer spectrometer ( ffts ) from omnisys instruments , sweden .",
    "available : http://www.omnisys.se ] this spectrometer facilitates 8 ghz of processing bandwidth with a resolution of 268 khz / channel , or 3724 channels / ghz .",
    "the 8 ghz omnisys ffts comes in a 19 \" rack and has two built - in if processor modules ( 4@xmath08 ghz each ) , an embedded controller module , a synchronization module , and power supply .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the single balanced mixer can be formed by connecting antipodal biased ( sis ) mixers to a 180@xmath4 or 90@xmath4 input hybrid .",
    "the 180@xmath4 hybrid , though having superior fundamental and intermodulation product suppression capabilities , is larger and more difficult to implement at submillimeter frequencies . at submillimeter and terahertz frequencies",
    "the harmonic and intermodulation products are however severely attenuated by the inherent device capacitance of the mixing element .",
    "for this reason , submillimeter or terahertz mixers may be configured with quadrature hybrids ( fig .",
    "[ balmixer ] ) @xcite rather than the larger and more complex 180@xmath4 hybrids couplers .     if hybrid . in the case of the cso mixers",

    "one cryostat houses the 180@xmath0280  ghz  /  400@xmath0520  ghz balanced mixers while a second cryostat houses the 280@xmath0420  ghz  /  580@xmath0720  ghz focal plane unit ( pfu ) .",

    "the submillimeter multipliers available : http://http://vadiodes.com// ] are mounted on the 15  k stage of a precision cryogenics available : http://www.precisioncryo.com/ ] hybrid cryostat .",
    "the latter is important in that multipliers are inefficient with most of the rf input power converted into heat .",
    "each cryostat receives two ( orthogonally polarized ) beams from the sky , which are routed via a cold wire - grid to the appropriate mixer . keeping the rf path length to a minimum the calculated intrinsic mixer block waveguide loss ( 4k ) ranges from 0.18  db ( 24.2  mm ) at 230  ghz to 0.34  db ( 9.3  mm ) at 650  ghz .",
    "this technique facilitates dual - frequency ( 2 color ) observations , improves observing efficiency , and assists pointing of the high frequency receivers in mediocre weather .",
    "we estimate that the required lo pump power ranges from 100 - 1000  nw for each ( twin ) sis junction depending on lo frequency ( @xmath9=@xmath10  @xmath11  0.78 on average ) @xcite . and since two sis junctions are used as part of the balanced configuration we require , including waveguide loss in the mixer block , @xmath110.5@xmath02.5  @xmath12w of local oscillator power at the mixer lo input port .",
    "given that the cooled frequency multipliers are 1 ) able to produce ample lo power over the described frequency bands and 2 ) increase 25@xmath040% in efficiency upon cooling , it is necessary to add attenuation in the lo - mixer path @xcite .",
    "in practice , this may be accomplished with a directional coupler or fixed tuned ( preset ) attenuator .",
    "a preset attenuator has the advantage of being simple , relatively inexpensive , and manually adjustable at room temperature .",
    "the effect of employing a cooled attenuator is similar to the use of a beam splitter with quasi - optical lo injection ; it reduces the multiplier - mixer cavity standing wave , and minimizes additive thermal noise from the local oscillator .",
    "additional reduction in lo amplitude and spurious noise is provided by the  noise canceling properties \" of the balanced mixer as observed from eq .",

    "these results can be understood in that the double - sided probe is essentially a planar variation of the well known eisenhart and khan waveguide probe @xcite .",
    "borrowing from withington and yassin s assessment @xcite , the real part of the probe s input impedance is influenced in a complex way by the parallel sum of individual non - propagating modal impedances , and as such , is frequency dependent . by lowering the height of the waveguide , the effect of non - propagating modes may be reduced @xcite-@xcite .",
