    "[ bounds1 ] ]    the crucial difference between the higgs and the stckelberg mechanism is that the gauge boson acquires a mass from the expectation value of a physical boson . as we will see in the following",
    "this additional boson will open new avenues of detection .",
    "moreover , the additional physical boson also allows for a new possible renormalizable coupling to the standard model .",
    "the hidden sector higgs can mix with the standard model higgs via a quartic term  @xcite , sometimes called the higgs - portal  @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next sect .",
