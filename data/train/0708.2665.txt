    "the lhcb experiment has been conceived to study cp violation and other rare phenomena in the b - meson decays with very high precision .",
    "the experiment is at the moment in the last phase of its construction , and is expected to be fully operational when the lhc machine will deliver its first pp collisions at 14 tev in the summer of 2008 .",
    "figure  [ lhcb ] shows the layout of the detector , of which a detailed description can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the detector has been designed to be able to cope with an instantaneous luminosity up to @xmath0 , and a total radiation dose corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "after an initial shake down of the detector in 2008 , the aim is to look for new physics ( np ) signatures compatible with luminosities around @xmath2 .",
    "the next four to five years , lhcb will accumulate @xmath3 to exploit the full physics program envisaged for the present detector . in the next section",
    "a selection will be presented of the expected performance of lhcb within the aforementioned luminosity range .    as mentioned above",
    ", lhcb will run at luminosities a factor 20 - 50 below the @xmath4 design luminosity of the lhc .",
    "the machine optics of lhcb do allow to focus the beams sufficiently to run at luminosities a factor ten larger .",
    "hence , the upgrade of lhcb is purely a question of the detector being able to profit from a higher peak luminosity .",
    "section  [ sect : lumi ] will describe the conditions as a function of the delivered peak luminosity , and the limitations of lhcb to efficiently exploit an increase in luminosity .",
    "the baseline upgrade scenario of the detector to superlhcb will be discussed in section  [ sect : super ] , followed by expectations of yields for some selected physics channels in comparison with the proposed superkekb performance in section  [ sect : yield ] .",
    "the conclusions will be presented in section  [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "the expected performance of lhcb is determined by generating pp interactions using the pythia 6.2 generator  @xcite , with the predefined option msel=2 . to extrapolate to 14 tev cm the value of the @xmath5 parameter",
    "has been tuned as a function of energy to existing data  @xcite .",
    "the resulting charged track multiplicities in the acceptance of the spectrometer are @xmath6 larger than a similar tuning of cdf  @xcite .",
    "the particles are propagated through a detailed detector description using geant .",
    "pileup in a bunch crossing , and spill - over from preceding and following bunches is included .",
    "trigger studies have shown that the events written to storage are dominated by @xmath7-events , hence all background is assumed to originate from @xmath7-events , of which the equivalent of about 13 minutes of lhcb running have been fully simulated .      the rare loop decay of b@xmath9 is sensitive to extensions of the standard model ( sm ) through loop corrections . within the sm",
    "the decay rate has been computed  @xcite to be br(b@xmath10 .",
    "np physics beyond the sm can increase this br . in the minimal super - symmetric extension of the sm ( mssm )",
    "the br increases as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "hence , this makes the br sensitive to models which prefer a relatively large @xmath12 .",
    "as an example figure  [ ellis ] shows the expected br as a function of the gaugino mass in the framework of a constrained minimal super - symmetric extension of the sm ( cmssm)@xcite . the experimental challenge lies in the rejection of background , which is predominantly due to two muons which combine to form a good vertex with a signal mass .",
    "the muons originate either from semi - leptonic b - decays , or are due to misidentification of hadrons .",
    "lhcb combines a good invariant mass resolution , @xmath13 mev , and excellent vertex resolution .",
    "in addition , the trigger can accept events with @xmath14 gev .",
    "figure  [ mumu ] shows the sensitivity  @xcite of br(b@xmath9 ) as a function of integrated luminosity . within the first years of running lhcb",
    "should be able to probe the whole cmssm parameter space for large @xmath12 values via this rare loop decay .    ) or discover ( @xmath15 ) the br(b@xmath8 as a function of integrated luminosity.,width=302 ]      while it is shown in the previous section that lhcb is very sensitive to np effects at large @xmath12 with a modest integrated luminosity , this section will explore the sensitivity to small @xmath12 parameter space using the second transversity amplitude @xmath17@xcite in the decay @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ f0502060 ] shows @xmath17 as a function of the dimuon mass for both the sm expectation , and for a representative choice of np parameters , notably @xmath18 , which do take into account the constraints from present observations .",
    "note that the whole region between the shown np curves and the sm are filled by solutions consistent with the constraints .",
    "the expected lhcb 95@xmath19 confidence interval sensitivity for @xmath20 has been superimposed  @xcite , assuming our measurements will fall precisely on the chosen np expectation . while @xmath21 might allow to observe a hint of np , an ten fold increase in statistic will allow a real observation of np if nature has chosen this particular constellation .",
    "arguably the most intriguing hint of np contributions to virtual loops in b - decays comes from the discrepancy between @xmath23 measured in the time dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath24 and in @xmath22 transitions .",
    "the later can not decay via a tree diagram in the sm , and hence is sensitive to np contributions in its loop decay diagrams .",
    "the hfag  @xcite averages for @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "although the discrepancy is not statistically significant , all @xmath22 show a value of @xmath27 which is lower than the tree counterpart .",
    "the expected sensitivity of lhcb for @xmath21 is @xmath28 , while b - factories for a combined integrated luminosity of @xmath29 expect an error of @xmath30 in @xmath31 .",
    "in addition lhcb has access to measuring the time dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath32-decays , which give access to the cp violating weak phase @xmath33 . while @xmath34 , @xmath35 , which is constrained to -0.035@xmath36 by a fit to the unitary triangle within the sm@xcite .",
    "np in the @xmath37 mixing box diagram could enhance @xmath38 . with a modest integrated luminosity of @xmath39 lhcb",
    "is expected to reach a sensitivity of @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "already this sensitivity will constrain the parameters space of many extensions of the sm  @xcite .",
    "the golden hadronic counterpart is the decay @xmath41 , which can only proceed via loop diagrams in the sm .",
    "in addition there is a cancellation of the @xmath32 mixing and decay phase in the sm  @xcite , which makes that @xmath42 the br@xmath43 is a factor eight larger than br(@xmath44 . in addition , as will be explained in the next section , this channel is much harder to trigger efficiently than channels with muons in the final state . as a consequence ,",
    "lhcb expects @xmath45  @xcite for an integrated luminosity of @xmath21 .",
    "even a factor of twenty increase in statistics will result in an experimental error on @xmath46 which is larger than the theoretical error .",
    "before going into details about what is limiting the lhcb detector to already profit from day one from larger luminosities , what follows is a brief description of the experimental environment at the lhcb interaction point as a function of luminosity . as already mentioned in the introduction , the lhc machine has been designed to deliver a luminosity up to @xmath4 at a general purpose detector ( gpd ) .",
    "the optics around the lhcb interaction point ( p8 ) allows lhcb to run at a luminosity up to @xmath47 of the luminosity available at a gpd .",
    "hence , the nominal lhc machine could deliver luminosities up to @xmath48 at p8 , the slhc , around the middle of the next decade . the bunch separation for lhcb will remain 25 ns ,",
    "but there are two schemes to fill the bunches",
    ". the preferred scheme will use large currents in the even bunches , and low current in the odd bunches .",
    "since p8 is displaced relative to the gpd interaction points by 1.5 bunch spacings , it will result in colliding odd with even bunches in p8 . in the gpd collision",
    "points the collisions are odd@xmath49odd and even@xmath49even .",
    "this will allow lhcb to choose its luminosity using the current in the odd bunches .",
    "a gpd will ignore the odd@xmath49odd interactions , since it will contribute a luminosity at least a factor 400 smaller than what is obtained in the even@xmath49even collisions . ] .",
    "the bunch crossing rate at p8 is given by the lhc machine to be 40.08 mhz , while 2622 out of the theoretically possible 3564 crossings  @xcite have protons in both bunches .",
    "hence , the maximum rate of crossings with at least one pp interaction is @xmath50 mhz .",
    "the expected inelastic pp cross - section is 79.2 mb , of which 63 mb has at least two charged particles which can be reconstructed , the so - called visible cross - section .",
    "figure  [ poisson ] show the number of crossings with at least one visible interaction and the mean number of visible interaction per crossing as a function of luminosity .",
    "note that increasing the luminosity from @xmath51 will only increase the mean number of interactions per crossing by a factor two , since the number of crossings with at least one interactions increases from @xmath52 mhz .",
    "while the increase in occupancy for detectors which are only sensitive to pileup is minimal , spill - over increases linearly with luminosity as is indicated in the bottom plot of figure  [ poisson ] .",
    "lhcb has a two level trigger system , called level-0 ( l0 ) and the high level trigger ( hlt ) .",
    "l0 is a trigger implemented in hardware , and its purpose is to reduce the rate of crossings with interactions to below a rate of 1.1 mhz .",
    "this is the maximum rate at which all lhcb data can be readout by the front - end ( fe ) electronics .",
    "l0 reconstructs the highest @xmath53 hadron , electron and photon , and the two highest @xmath54 muons .",
    "it triggers on events with a threshold of typically @xmath55 gev , @xmath56 gev , and @xmath57 gev at @xmath58 .",
    "figure  [ l0acc ] shows the yield of l0-triggered events , normalized to their yield at @xmath58 as a function of the luminosity for a leptonic and a hadronic b - decay channel .",
    "the l0-hadron trigger absorbs @xmath59 of the l0 bandwidth at @xmath58 , and its threshold is already larger than half the b - mass .",
    "the increase in mainly the rate of visible pp interactions requires an increase in the threshold , and the resulting loss in efficiency nullifies the increase in luminosity , resulting in an almost constant yield for the hadron trigger .",
    "contrary , the muon trigger absorbs only @xmath60 of the available bandwidth at @xmath58 , at which rate it already has a efficiency around @xmath61 for leptonic b - decays . for larger luminosities",
    "the loss in efficiency is minor , showing an almost linear dependence of its yield on luminosity .",
    "note that at a luminosity of @xmath62 about half the yield in @xmath63 is due to the muon trigger on the leptonic decay of the tagging b.    after l0 , all detectors are readout , and full event building is performed on the cpu nodes of the event filter farm ( eff ) .",
    "the hlt consists of a c++ application which is running on every cpu of the eff , which contains between 1000 and 2000 multi - core computing nodes .",
    "each hlt application has access to all data in one event , and thus in principle could be executing the off - line selection algorithms , which would render it a 100@xmath19 trigger efficiency by definition . but",
    "given the 1 mhz output rate of l0 and the limited cpu power available , the hlt aims at rejecting the bulk of the events by using only part of the full information which is available .",
    "the hlt starts with so - called alleys , where each alley addresses one of the trigger types of the l0-trigger , enriching the b - content of the events by refining the l0 objects , and adding impact parameter information .",
    "if an event is selected by at least one alley , it is processed by the inclusive triggers , where specific resonances are reconstructed and selected , and the exclusive triggers , which aim to fully reconstruct b - hadron final states .",
    "events will be written to storage with a rate of @xmath64 khz .    as is shown in figure  [ l0acc ] ,",
    "even hadronic b - decays receive a considerable fraction of their l0 efficiency due to the muon trigger which is usually fired by a leptonic decay of the opposite b. hence , in the 2 khz output rate about half is reserved for events with a large @xmath54 muon with a significant impact parameter .",
    "simulation shows that 900 hz of single muon triggers contain @xmath65 hz of true @xmath66 decays .",
    "figure  [ inclmu ] illustrates the yield of b - decays , of which the decay products are fully contained in the lhcb acceptance , while the event is triggered on the semi - leptonic b - decay of the other b - hadron .",
    "it shows the correlation of the @xmath67-pair in pseudo rapidity , which makes that when the lepton from a semi - leptonic decay of one of the b - mesons is in the acceptance of lhcb , there is a @xmath68 probability that all the decay product of the opposite b are also contained in the spectrometer .",
    "hence , just the inclusive muon trigger will already provide a rate of @xmath69 fully contained b - decays , with a tagging performance of @xmath70 due to the presence of a large @xmath54 muon .",
    "the typical efficiency of the whole trigger chain for hadronic , radiative and leptonic b - decays is 25 - 30@xmath19 , 30 - 40@xmath19 and 60 - 70@xmath19 respectively .",
    "an upgrade of the trigger should not only be able to cope with larger luminosities , but should be designed to at least gain a factor two for hadronic b - decays like @xmath63 .",
    "the tracking of lhcb commences by reconstructing all tracks inside the velo .",
    "the velo is based on silicon ( si)-sensors , and the channel occupancy at @xmath71 is @xmath72 , which is kept roughly constant as a function of the radius due to the layout of the strips . this occupancy increases to @xmath73 at @xmath74 . as a result the tracking performance  @xcite in the velo",
    "looses only @xmath75 in efficiency for this factor ten increase in luminosity , while using reconstruction code tuned for the low luminosities .",
    "this is as expected from figure  [ poisson ] , since the velo electronics has a limited sensitivity to spill - over , and as a consequence only @xmath76 of its hits at @xmath74 are due to spill - over .    to assign momentum to the velo tracks ,",
    "every track is combined with a hit in the t - stations , located behind the magnet , in turn . around the trajectory defined by the velo track and",
    "a t - hit , a search is performed in the other tracking stations including tt .",
    "in addition there is also a stand - alone pattern recognition performed in the t - stations , mainly to recover @xmath77 which decay behind the velo .",
    "the outer part of the t - stations ( ot ) are constructed of 5 mm diameter straws , with a drift - time up to 50 ns . including the effect of the length of the 2.4 m long wires",
    ", this requires a readout gate of three consecutive crossings to obtain the maximum efficiency . as a consequence , the ot occupancy rises from @xmath78 for a ten - fold luminosity increase from @xmath79 . at @xmath74 @xmath80 of the ot",
    "hits are due to spill - over . both tt and",
    "the inner part of the t - stations ( it ) are made of si - sensors . at @xmath74 @xmath81 of the tt(it )",
    "hits are due to spill - over .    the tracking performance as a function of luminosity is shown in figure  [ teff ] .",
    "above a luminosity of @xmath82 the difference between the tracking performance with full spill - over and a spill - over equivalent to the spill - over at @xmath71 is clearly visible .",
    "the per track loss in tracking efficiency from @xmath83 is @xmath84 , which is a small price to be paid , even for a 4-prong decay , compared to the factor 5 increase in luminosity .",
    "however , an additional increase of a factor two in luminosity would result in a loss of 36@xmath19 of the 4-prong decays , hence would almost eliminate the additional factor two increase .",
    "the electronics of the rich detector is virtually insensitive to spill - over .",
    "the increase in occupancy for an event with a @xmath67-pair and its pileup events is only a factor 2.5 for the factor ten increase in luminosity to @xmath74 .",
    "this is even a smaller increase than shown in figure  [ poisson ] , since pp - interactions producing a @xmath67-pair cause about twice the occupancy compared to visible pp - interactions .",
    "the efficiency to positively identify a kaon degrades by @xmath85 for the 10 fold increase in luminosity .",
    "the loss is dominated by the degradation of the rich1 performance , which has the higher backgrounds and occupancies . in the above simulation the effect of inefficiency due to overflowing buffers at high occupancy",
    "has not been taken into account , since it will be argued in the next section that the front - end electronics will have to be replaced to allow the trigger to be upgraded .",
    "the muon chambers and the calorimeters both have negligible sensitivity to spill - over , and hence the increase in occupancy follows the same trend as that of the rich .",
    "their performances development as a function of luminosity is more related to dead time inefficiency and radiation damage , rather than occupancy per bunch crossing .",
    "these effects are not simulated in the mc , and hence no reliable performance as a function of luminosity is available .",
    "in the previous section it was shown that the sub - system of lhcb which does not scale in performance with an increased luminosity is the trigger , and in particular the trigger for hadronic b - decays which will not be able to retain its efficiency for larger luminosities .",
    "since the trigger efficiency for hadronic b - decays is expected to be @xmath86 , the goal of an upgrade of the trigger should also be to to improve on the hadron trigger efficiency by at least a factor two . at 14 tev center of mass pp collisions @xmath87",
    "is assumed to be 500 @xmath88b .",
    "hence , with a luminosity of @xmath74 there will be @xmath89 @xmath90-pairs produced in the lhcb interaction point per second , of which @xmath91 will have at least one b - hadron with a polar angle below 400 mrad , i.e. pointing in the direction of the spectrometer .",
    "hence , an efficient and selective trigger should already at a very large rate be able to distinguish between wanted and unwanted b - decays .",
    "pilot studies on improving the trigger all show that the only way to be able to provide adequate selectivity of the trigger , and maintain large efficiency for hadronic b - decays is to be able to measure both the momentum and impact parameter of b - decay products simultaneously .",
    "the present fe - architecture imposes that the detectors which do not participate in the l0-trigger can only be read - out with a maximum event rate of 1.1 mhz , and that the l0-latency available for making the l0 decision , which is now 1.5@xmath88s , can be stretched to a few @xmath88s at most .",
    "the algorithms required to efficiently select b - decays require latencies far superior to what is available with the present architecture .",
    "hence , superlhcb has opted for a fe - architecture which requires all sub - detectors to read - out their data at the full 40 mhz rate of the lhc machine .",
    "the data should be transmitted over optical fibers to an interface board ( tell40  @xcite ) between the fe and a large eff .",
    "the trigger algorithm is then executed on the eff , much like the present hlt .",
    "technology tracking estimates show that by 2013 superlhcb should be able to acquire sufficient cpu power to be able to perform a hlt like trigger on a large cpu farm .",
    "however , in case the eff at the start of superlhcb would be undersized , the tell40 boards will be equipped with a throttle to prevent buffer overflows .",
    "this throttle should also include an event selection much like the present l0 , based on the data available in the tell40 boards , to enrich rather than just pre - scale events . at a luminosity of @xmath92 and an assumed cpu power able to process 5 mhz of events ,",
    "the trigger efficiency is @xmath93 for the channel @xmath94 .",
    "for this simulation the throttle requires at least one hcal - cluster with @xmath95 gev , which has an efficiency of @xmath96 for this signal .",
    "note that a 2 gev requirement would correspond to 10 mhz of input rate into the eff , while it would increase the efficiency from @xmath97 at the start of the eff , while with lhcb running at @xmath71 the equivalent efficiency for this channel at the start of the hlt is only @xmath98 .",
    "the upgraded fe - architecture requires that the fe - electronics of all sub - detectors needs to be replaced , with the exception of the muon chambers which already have the 40 mhz capability .",
    "the si - detectors , which cover the areas close to the beam , will suffer from a five fold increase in allowed radiation dose , and hence need to be replaced by more radiation resistant technologies . for the rich the photon detection and the fe - electronics is combined in a hybrid photo detector , which needs to be replaced entirely .",
    "the ot requires the replacement of its fe - boards .",
    "running these detectors with a slightly faster gas , combined with taking advantage of being able to pre - process spill - over in the tell40 boards could reduce the occupancy from @xmath99 at @xmath74 .",
    "this could be combined with enlarging the coverage of it , to reduce the occupancy close to the beam even further .",
    "the m1 muon chamber , which is located just before the calorimeter , would suffer from a too high occupancy , and will be removed .",
    "it now serves to provide an improved momentum measurement in l0 , which will no longer be necessary .",
    "the resolution in the inner part of the calorimeter will degrade with radiation .",
    "it will have to be replaced with a more radiation tolerant technology .",
    "this might also allow lhcb to extend the calorimeter coverage down to @xmath100 from the present maximum pseudo rapidity of 4.2 , i.e. an increase in coverage of 25@xmath19 .",
    "last but not least , all results presented from simulation studies did not attempt to adapt the algorithms to a higher occupancy environment , hence they are considered to be conservative .",
    "the lhc machine schedule assumes that first collisions at 14 tev will be delivered in the summer of 2008 .",
    "the top plot of figure  [ yield ] shows the expected integrated luminosity profile , which assumes that lhcb will run at @xmath101 , and that the machine and experiment will only slowly ramp up to the full capability in 2011 .",
    "lhcb would then run at maximum luminosity for two years , and then have a one year shutdown to change over to the new fe - architecture in 2013 . in 2014",
    "it assumes to run at half of its full capability , after which it accumulates @xmath102 per year for the rest of the next decade .    for comparison the running scenario of the proposed superkekb  @xcite",
    "is shown in the same plot .",
    "the closed squares ( open circles ) show the information of lhcb ( kekb ) .",
    "the middle and bottom plots show the expected yield for @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 after trigger and strict off - line selection to obtain a good background / signal ratio . for the channels which require tagging to perform the time dependent cp asymmetry analysis , the yield has been multiplied by the effective tagging efficiency @xmath106 , 0.07 and 0.3 for lhcb and kekb respectively , to take into account the better tagging performance at a b - factory .",
    "the last few years have seen an impressive progress in precision measurements of b - decays , notably from the b - factories and the fermilab collider .",
    "the remarkable agreement between cp conserving and violating observables indicates that the main source of cp - violation can be attributed to the km - mechanism  @xcite . in their quest for discovering np",
    ", the new generation of experiments have to be able to detect small deviations from the sm , which requires increasingly larger data sets .",
    "lhcb is nearing the end of its construction , and will be ready to look for np with a projected integrated luminosity of around @xmath107 in the years to come .",
    "this paper describes the way lhcb can be upgraded to be able to have access to np even beyond the possibilities of the first phase of lhcb .",
    "the main component of lhcb which limits it to profit from the available nominal luminosity of the lhc machine is the hadron - trigger .",
    "consequently superlhcb will have a new fe - architecture and trigger which aims at being able to cope with luminosities around @xmath74 , and which will have a hadron trigger efficiency twice larger than the present trigger , resulting in a twenty fold increase in hadronic b - decays available for analysis .",
    "in addition , the leptonic decay channels will profit from an increase in luminosity at least linearly .",
    "this paper would not have been possible without the work done by many of my colleagues in lhcb , notably those who contributed to the `` 1@xmath108 lhcb collaboration upgrade workshop ''  @xcite .",
