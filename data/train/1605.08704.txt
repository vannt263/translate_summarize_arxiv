    "the proof also relies on energy estimates inspired by a normal - form transform of the form , but the details of the proof are simpler in the following sense .",

    "the fact that the resonance at @xmath146 is trivial correlates with the fact that @xmath90 exists for any @xmath91 .",

    "such a resonance is called a non - trivial resonance .",
    "the fact that the resonances at @xmath150 are non - trivial correlates with the fact that @xmath137 may not exist .",
    "in the situation of a trivial resonance at @xmath146 and non - trivial resonances at @xmath150 , it is possible to apply a technique from @xcite for constructing a modified normal - form transform . the construction principle is as follows .",
    "since @xmath151 vanishes at @xmath146 , one can expect that @xmath152 will grow for @xmath153 near @xmath154 more slowly than for @xmath153 further away from @xmath154 .",

    "however , since the error equation is quasilinear , also the modified normal - form transform @xmath179 loses one derivative .",
    "it can be shown that this normal - form transform is nevertheless invertible , but the term of order @xmath180 in the transformed error equation loses two derivatives if it is expressed in terms of @xmath181 .    to overcome the regularity problems , we pursue again the strategy from the proof of theorem [ theorem 1 langzeit loesung ] that we do not perform the normal - form transform explicitly , but only use it to construct an energy of the form @xmath182 where the summands @xmath183 are defined by a slight , @xmath83-dependent modification of the equation @xmath184 where @xmath116 is defined by , @xmath66 is defined by , and the mappings @xmath175 are as in . since @xmath185 for @xmath169 if @xmath186 , we do not need to include the second normal - form transform in our energy for @xmath187 .",
    "hence , we define @xmath188 for @xmath186",
    ". then partial integration yields @xmath189 for @xmath186 .",
    "because the mapping @xmath190 is in general not positive definite , we have to perform the full normal - form transform in the case of @xmath191 and define @xmath192 the resulting loss of regularity does not mind here because it can be compensated with the help of the other components of our energy such that we obtain the equivalence of @xmath193 and @xmath194 for @xmath195 and sufficiently small @xmath26 , see corollary [ en - aequi ] . consequently , the right - hand side of the evolution equation of @xmath196 can be written as a sum of integral terms containing at most one factor @xmath197 and not two .",
    "moreover , since @xmath198 differs from @xmath196 only by terms of order @xmath199 , the evolution equations of @xmath196 and @xmath198 share the property that their right - hand sides are of order @xmath199 .",
    "therefore , by using partial integration , we obtain @xmath200 as long as @xmath201 such that gronwall s inequality yields the @xmath103-boundedness of @xmath202 and hence of @xmath116 for all @xmath203 $ ] .    for the reasons discussed above , the justification of the nls approximation for dispersive systems with quasilinear quadratic terms is a highly nontrivial problem , which has been remained unsolved in general for more than four decades .",
    "the first and very general nls approximation theorem for quasilinear dispersive wave systems was shown in @xcite .",
    "however , the occurrence of quasilinear quadratic terms was excluded explicitly . in the case of quasilinear quadratic terms ,",
    "an nls approximation theorem was proven for dispersive wave systems where the right - hand sides lose only half a derivative . the 2d water wave problem without surface tension and finite depth of water in lagrangian",
    "coordinates falls into this class . in this case",
    "the elimination of the quadratic terms is possible with the help of normal - form transforms .",
    "the right - hand sides of the transformed systems then lose one derivative and can be handled with the help of the cauchy - kowalevskaya theorem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nls approximation was justified for the 2d and 3d water wave problem without surface tension and infinite depth of water @xcite by finding a different transform adapted to the special structure of that problem .",
    "similarly , for the quasilinear korteweg - de vries equation the result can be obtained by simply applying a miura transform @xcite . in @xcite , the nls approximation of time oscillatory long waves for equations with quasilinear quadratic terms",
    "was proven for analytic data without using a normal - form transform . moreover ,",
    "another approach to address the problem of the validity of the nls approximation can be found in @xcite .",
    "finally , some numerical evidence that the nls approximation is also valid for quasilinear equations was given in @xcite .",
    "very recently , the first validity proof of the nls approximation of a nonlinear wave equation with a quasilinear quadratic term in sobolev spaces was given in @xcite .",
    "the proof also relies on estimates of an appropriate energy which is constructed with the help of a normal - form transform .",
    "the construction of the energy is easier in the sense that no problems with resonances occur , but more difficult in the sense that the energy has to allow to control a system of two coupled error equations .    in forthcoming papers",
    ", we intend to combine the methods of the present paper with the methods from @xcite to prove the validity of the nls approximation for a larger class of quasilinear dispersive systems with resonances .",
