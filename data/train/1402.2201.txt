    "an atom s core level binding energies depend on its chemical species .",
    "this fact has been exploited for decades in order to determine the proportion of different species within a given sample via core level spectroscopy - which provides the distribution of core electron binding energies within a sample .",
    "an atom s binding energies also depend on its environment , i.e. , the species of its surrounding atoms .",
    "for instance , in a cu metal all atoms have the same environment , and hence the binding energies for a given cu core level type , e.g. 2p@xmath0 , will be the same for all atoms .",
    "by contrast , in a cupd alloy exhibiting substitutional disorder the cu atoms exhibit a variety of environments , and hence also a variety of 2p@xmath0 binding energies .",
    "such a dispersion in the binding energies has been observed in many alloy systems @xcite , and in theory can be used to deduce information about specific environments within a sample , including the concentration profile on the atomic scale .",
    "the viability of achieving this via high kinetic energy photoelectron spectroscopy ( hike ) has recently been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "this is promising because hike , unlike other widely - used techniques , is both bulk - sensitive and non - destructive .",
    "such environment - resolved spectroscopy would prove useful to the many research areas involving alloys in which segregation plays a crucial role , e.g. metal embrittlement @xcite , and nanocatalyst design @xcite .",
    "however , success in this endeavor hinges upon a solid understanding of the relationship between an atom s environment , its electronic structure , and its core level binding energies in alloys .",
    "the central quantity with regards to environment - resolved spectroscopy in alloys is the ( alloy - metal ) core level shift ( cls ) , which for a core level bound to an @xmath1 site @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the binding energy of the core level , and @xmath5 is the binding energy of the core level belonging to the type under consideration in a pure @xmath1 metal .",
    "note that this is a site - dependent quantity ; one must determine @xmath6 for all @xmath1 sites in the system under consideration in order to determine the @xmath1 cls distribution .",
    "this is problematic for systems exhibiting substitutional disorder on account of their lack of periodicity - which is a prerequisite for treatment within the conventional theoretical framework exploited by most _",
    "ab initio _ methods .",
    "one way around this problem is to approximate the system under consideration as periodic , but with a large unit cell , i.e. , a supercell . in this _ supercell approximation _",
    "one determines @xmath6 for all @xmath1 sites , and hopes that the range of environments exhibited by these sites is representative of the ` true ' ( non - periodic ) system , and hence will result in an accurate representation of the true @xmath1 cls distribution .",
    "random alloys - the archetype of disordered alloys in which there are no correlations between the species of sites - are the most tractable system exhibiting substitutional disorder to treat theoretically , and have been the focus of both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite attempts to understand the distribution of clss in alloys . in this context the dispersion of @xmath1 clss is known as ` disorder broadening ' on account of the increased width of , for example , the cu cls distribution for a cupd random alloy relative to that for a cu metal .",
    "sophisticated _ ab initio _ models utilizing the supercell approximation have provided insight into disorder broadening in these systems @xcite .",
    "however , most systems of practical interest can not be idealized as random alloys , and unfortunately the complexity of these systems is such that a description of their disorder broadenings using _ ab initio _ models is intractable within the supercell approximation .",
    "accurate methods do exist which do not resort to the supercell approximation .",
    "_ ab initio _ methods rooted in the coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite have been shown to provide excellent agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they can treat complex systems @xcite .",
    "however , cpa - based approaches can not provide detailed information regarding the disorder broadening in complex systems - nor even random alloys . while phenomenological models have been developed which can provide such information @xcite ,",
    "their accuracy has been questioned @xcite .",
    "one criticism is that these models do not take into account ` final state effects ' associated with changes in the valence electron density after photoemission .",
    "it has even been claimed that the complexity of the relationship between clss and environment in alloys precludes an accurate alternative to _ ab initio _",
    "methods @xcite .    here",
    "we present an accurate phenomenological model for clss in alloys which relates @xmath6 - including the final state contribution - to the environment of site @xmath2 .",
    "the model , like previous approaches , is charge - transfer based , and provides a simple framework for rationalizing the disorder broadening phenomenon .",
    "the layout of this work is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we review the theory which underpins the model , and derive expressions for clss which apply to a wide range of alloy systems .",
    "we then apply the model to the problem of characterizing the interface quality of metallic multilayers .",
    "this problem has received significant attention on account of its importance to nanotechnology @xcite , and can be restated as follows : what is the degree of ` interface roughening ' @xmath7 in a given sample ?",

    "[ sec : nracefm_deltaebi ] is valid for _ any _ alloy - subject to the assumptions which underpin the nra - cefm - our expressions for means and fwhms apply only to the class of alloys which can be described as having a concentration profile which varies along one direction from monolayer to monolayer . to elaborate , for an alloy belonging to this class , the quantities @xmath13 for all @xmath1 and @xmath14 describe the concentration profile , where @xmath13 denotes the concentration of @xmath1 sites within monolayer @xmath14 , and we are assuming that the species of sites belonging to a given monolayer @xmath14 are assigned randomly in the appropriate concentrations . note that this class includes random alloys , for which @xmath15 for all @xmath14 , where @xmath16 denotes the global concentration of species @xmath1 . furthermore , note that we use the following convention for labeling the monolayers : monolayer @xmath14 is the @xmath14th monolayer in the direction in which the concentrations of each species are varying .      the charge - excess functional model ( cefm ) @xcite has been shown to provide an accurate description of the charge distribution in disordered alloys @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown to provide an accurate description of energy differences between alloy configurations with the same _ composition _ @xcite - where by composition we mean a specification of the underlying lattice and the quantities @xmath16 for all @xmath1 . in the cefm",
    "the alloy energy is postulated to take the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the madelung energy , @xmath19 is the madelung potential of site @xmath2 , @xmath20 is the net charge on site @xmath2 , @xmath21 is the strength of the ` local interactions ' within site @xmath2 which act to keep the charge of site @xmath2 at its ` bare ' value @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "for all @xmath1 sites , @xmath21 and @xmath22 take the same values @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "minimizing @xmath26 subject to the constraint of charge neutrality leads to the following expression @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a lagrange multiplier added to enforce charge neutrality .",
    "eqn . describes the _ q - v _ relations , which are borne out in _ ab initio _ calculations to a high degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "this partly explains the success of the cefm .",
    "eqn . can be derived within the class of generalized coherent potential approximations ( gcpas ) described by bruno _",
    "@xcite , with the additional - essentially exact @xcite - assumption that charge transfer due to madelung interactions is small .",
    "here we consider the cefm within this framework , in which case @xmath25 is equivalent to the charge of an @xmath1 site embedded in the gcpa effective medium for the system under consideration , given the constraint that the site s madelung potential is 0 .",
    "in other words , @xmath25 is the charge of an @xmath1 site embedded in the effective medium if the madelung interactions are ` switched off ' .",
    "furthermore , @xmath24 is the linear response coefficient relating the madelung potential of the @xmath1 site to its perturbation from @xmath25 , and @xmath23 is the energy of the alloy if the madelung interactions between sites are switched off - which can be expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy of an @xmath1 site embedded in the effective medium if madelung interactions are switched off , and @xmath32 is the total number of sites in the system .",
    "conventional cpa calculations do not take into account madelung interactions , and hence for gcpa theories based upon cpa effective media @xmath25 is simply the charge of an @xmath1 site obtained from a conventional cpa calculation , and @xmath31 is the corresponding @xmath1 energy .",
    "calculations reveal that gcpa effective media are numerically indistinguishable @xcite for all alloys with the same composition .",
    "hence the same applies for the quantities @xmath25 , @xmath24 and @xmath23 : these quantities are transferable between such systems .",
    "the complexity of the cefm is significantly reduced if one makes the assumption that @xmath24 takes the same value @xmath33 for all species @xcite .",
    "this assumption is known as the non - random approximation ( nra ) , and we use it throughout this work .",

    "note that the free parameters @xmath33 and @xmath43 ( for all @xmath44 ) can be obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations or by other means @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the values of @xmath35 for all @xmath37 and @xmath36 characterize the environment of @xmath2 . therefore eqn . explicitly relates @xmath20 to the environment of site @xmath2 .",
    "eqn . also allows us to interpret an alloy s charge distribution in terms of charge transfer between pairs of _ unlike _ sites as follows @xcite : an @xmath1 site gains a charge @xmath45 from each @xmath36 site in its @xmath37th nearest neighbor shell , with the @xmath36 site losing the opposite amount .",
    "this picture allows us to attribute the following physical significance to the quantity @xmath46 : it is a measure of the _ electropositivity _ of species @xmath36 for the given composition .",
    "we will now use the nra - cefm to derive an expression for the cls of site @xmath2 . to do this",
    ", we first derive an expression for the total energy @xmath26 in terms of the bare charges @xmath22 of all sites .",
    "eqn . can be rewritten more explicitly as @xmath47 for the nra - cefm , where we have used eqn . .",
    "minimizing this with respect to the site charges , and subject to the constraint of global charge neutrality gives @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the mean value of @xmath22 over all @xmath2 . substituting the above into eqn . and simplifying gives @xmath50 where we have used the fact that @xmath51 now , the following expression holds for the charges at the minimum in @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 denotes the madelung matrix , and @xmath55 denotes the identity matrix .",
    "this becomes @xmath56 since @xcite @xmath57 substituting eqn . into eqn .",
    "gives @xmath58 which becomes @xmath59 after separating out the terms containing @xmath60 and noting that @xmath61 is a symmetric matrix @xcite .",
    "we will use the above equation in a moment .",
    "the binding energy of a core level associated with site @xmath62 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the energy of the alloy s initial state - before photoemission from site @xmath62 , and @xmath65 denotes the energy of the alloy s final state - after photoemission from site @xmath62 . in the complete screening picture @xcite the valence electrons in the final state",
    "are assumed to be fully relaxed so to reach their minimum energy configuration . with this in mind , the energy of the final state is simply the energy of the initial state , but with the atomic core within @xmath62 replaced by its photo - ionized analogue .",
    "we choose site @xmath62 to belong to species @xmath1 , and denote the ` species ' corresponding to a photo - ionized @xmath1 site as @xmath66 .",
    "hence @xmath67 is the energy change if site @xmath62 , originally belonging to species @xmath1 , is transformed into species @xmath66 .",
    "eqn . allows us to evaluate the change in @xmath26 due to such a transformation . noting that the terms on the lower line of eqn .",
    "are unaffected by the transformation ( since @xmath33 and @xmath25 for all @xmath1 are composition - dependent , and the composition - which we defined in terms of macroscopic quantities - is unaffected by the transformation ) , that the transformation is such that @xmath68 , and also that @xmath69 ( see eqn . ) , we obtain @xmath70 this can be rearranged to give @xmath71 which in turn becomes @xmath72 after using eqn . and noting that @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath74 in the above equation refers to the charge of site @xmath62 _ before _ photoemission . finally , substituting the above equation into eqn . , and relabeling site @xmath62 as site @xmath2 , we obtain the following expression for the cls associated with site @xmath2 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is composition - dependent .    eqn . describes a species- and composition - dependent linear mapping between @xmath20 and @xmath6 .",
    "therefore changes in the @xmath1 cls distribution associated with configuration changes - such as an increase in the interface roughening @xmath7 in a multilayer system - directly reflect changes in the @xmath1 charge distribution .",
    "furthermore the _ shape _ of the cls distribution is the same as that of the charge distribution on account of the linear nature of the mapping between @xmath20 and @xmath6 .",
    "we will elaborate on these points later .",
    "henceforth we consider the mean and fwhm of the cls distributions for various groups of @xmath1 sites .",

    "alternatively , one can explain the disorder narrowing in terms of the evolution of the @xmath253 histogram for species @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_a5b2c](b ) ) . at @xmath10",
    "the environment of the @xmath92 sites on the edge monolayer is @xmath254 , which steadily transitions to @xmath276 as @xmath233 .",
    "the latter environment has a cls closer to that of the non - edge @xmath92 sites , i.e. , @xmath277 , and hence the spectrum narrows as @xmath7 is increased .    , except that this figure pertains to the alloy system @xmath268/@xmath278/@xmath170,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "above we have presented a model for core level shifts in alloys , and have used it to add insight into the relationship between atomic environment , charge transfer and disorder broadening in complex systems .",
    "our key result is that the mapping between the distribution of atomic environments and core level spectra is often counterintuitive .",
    "for instance , systems with inhomogeneous concentration profiles can exhibit significantly larger disorder broadenings than is possible in random alloys , and even a ` disorder narrowing ' in some cases .",
    "for the correct interpretation of experimental spectra for complex systems , it is crucially important to understand such phenomena .    the model can be easily adapted to treat other core level spectroscopies , the most prominent of which is auger electron spectroscopy .",
    "hence we expect that it should find widespread use as a framework in which to interpret experimental results .",
    "however , it is by no means a panacea .",
    "recall that the model is underpinned by the nra - cefm - which itself is a particular case of the cefm .",
    "implicit in the nra - cefm are a number of approximations which may be problematic .",
    "one is the _",
    "spherical approximation _ - that only the monopole moments of the charge distribution in each site are considered for the purposes of evaluating the madelung energy .",
    "one must go beyond this approximation in order to obtain a quantitatively accurate description of the electron density within disordered alloys @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for regions near surfaces .",
    "a generalization of the cefm has been described in ref . which does not rely upon the spherical approximation . while the nra - cefm could be generalized in an analogous manner , it is not clear whether this would be fruitful .",
    "the strength of the nra - cefm over the ` general ' cefm is its simplicity , with which comes a small loss in accuracy relative to the cefm .",
    "it is not clear whether the gain in accuracy achieved by generalizing the nra - cefm to go beyond the spherical approximation is worth the resulting loss in simplicity .",
    "another potentially problematic approximation implicit in the nra - cefm is that the nuclei of the system under consideration form an undistorted crystal lattice .",
    "the breakdown of this approximation can have far - reaching consequences .",
    "the addition of distortions to the crystal lattice of cuau results in a reversal of the average relationship between a site s cls and its number of unlike nearest neighbors @xcite . the reasons for this are not known , and warrant further investigation .",
    "the nra - cefm , suitably modified to treat lattice distortions , may add insight into this phenomenon , though it would be optimistic to expect that anything more than a qualitative understanding could be achieved .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the aforementioned approximations , while implicit in the nra - cefm , are also utilized in many _",
    "ab initio _ calculations , and are not expected to preclude the model from making _ at least _ qualitatively accurate predictions",
    ". a more problematic limitation of the model is that its free parameters are not known _ a priori _ : they must be obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations or by other means .",
    "fortunately these parameters are highly transferable between systems ; for details see refs . . in the future",
    "we intend to calculate these parameters for a wide range of alloys .",
    "this would enable the model to be readily applied to many systems ."
