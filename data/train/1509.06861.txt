    "it is well established that the tomonaga - luttinger model ( tlm)@xcite with linear single - particle dispersion and a two - particle interaction potential @xmath0 which is finite at zero momentum transfer @xmath5 forms the infrared fixed point under renormalization group ( rg ) flow of a large class of gapless one - dimensional ( 1d ) models of correlated fermions.@xcite this is the essence of the much celebrated luttinger liquid ( ll ) universality.@xcite it implies that the low - temperature thermodynamic properties as well as the low - energy spectral functions of a model belonging to the ll universality class are equivalent to the ones of the tlm .",
    "understanding the low - energy physics of the latter is thus of crucial importance .",
    "fortunately , using bosonization@xcite it is possible to derive exact and closed analytical expressions for thermodynamic observables such as the specific heat or the compressibility as well as for space - time correlation functions of the tlm . from the latter spectral functions",
    "can be computed by fourier transform .",
    "the bosonization expressions for correlation functions of the tlm depending on position @xmath6 and time @xmath7 generically contain integrals over momenta . within constructive bosonization , which is based on operator identities,@xcite these",
    "are naturally regularized in the ultraviolet by the momentum - space range @xmath8 of the two - particle potential @xmath0 . for time - dependent correlation functions the momentum integrals can not be performed even if a specific form of @xmath0 is assumed.@xcite however , one can show that the momentum dependence of the interaction is rg irrelevant.@xcite this is employed to justify the following procedure : in the final expressions for the space - time correlation functions @xmath0 is routinely replaced by a constant . as a consequence the momentum integrals become divergent in the ultraviolet .",
    "these divergences are regularized ( ` by hand ' ) applying an ad hoc procedure.@xcite we already now emphasize that this regularization is not unique . after these steps",
    "the momentum integrals can be performed and integral - free expressions for space - time correlation functions are obtained . in field - theory",
    "inspired phenomenological bosonization procedures @xcite the momentum dependence of the interaction is often neglected from the outset ( even in the hamiltonian ) . in correlation functions",
    "this leads to the same ultraviolet divergences as described above requiring again a regularization ` by hand ' .",
    "similarly , the purely fermionic approach to the single - particle green function @xmath9 of the tlm by dzyaloshinski and larkin @xcite requires an ad hoc ultraviolet regularization .",
    "we thus emphasize that the integral - free expressions for a variety of time - dependent correlation functions which can be found in the literature can not be considered as the corresponding _",
    "exact _ correlation functions of the tlm .",
    "this is often acknowledged by stating that the integral - free expressions of the ad hoc procedure only agree to the exact ones at ` asymptotically large space - time distances ' ; as discussed in ref .",
    "( see also below ) , even this is incorrect when considering the decay in the directions specified by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being one of the eigenmode velocities at small momentum .",
    "we now focus on the two - point correlation function  the green function  at temperature @xmath12 from which the single - particle spectral function can be computed by fourier transform .",
    "the spectral function is of particular importance as it provides forthright access to correlation effects and can directly be related to photoemission spectra .",
    "we consider the momentum integrated function @xmath13 [ @xmath14 , which is experimentally accessible in angular integrated [ inverse ] photoemission , as well as the momentum resolved spectral function @xmath15 [ @xmath16 . a measurement of the latter requires momentum resolution .",
    "it was shown that the universal low - energy power - law suppression of @xmath17 for @xmath18 , with @xmath19 is unaffected by the above ad hoc procedure.@xcite regardless of the details of @xmath0 the exponent @xmath20 depends on the potential at vanishing momentum transfer @xmath21 ( only ) , that is the constant interaction strength after the ad hoc procedure .",
    "furthermore , the power - law nonanalyticity of @xmath22 exactly at the fermi momentum @xmath23 remains the same ; depending on the size of @xmath21 a divergence ( @xmath24 ) or suppression ( @xmath25 ) might occur .",
    "these findings are consistent with the rg irrelevance of the momentum dependence of @xmath0 as in both cases _ all _ energy scales , that is @xmath26 _ and , _ in the case of momentum resolved spectra , @xmath27 are sent to zero.@xcite here @xmath28 denotes the fermi velocity .",
    "the question we address here is whether or not any of the standard ad hoc procedures is legitimate when it comes to @xmath29 as a function of @xmath26 at fixed @xmath30 . employing these to compute @xmath29 of the spinless tlm , characteristic algebraic threshold nonanalyticities at @xmath31 $ ] with the charge velocity @xmath32 of the (",
    "collective , bosonic ) charge eigenmodes were found . in the model with spin",
    "additional algebraic nonanalyticities appear at @xmath33 $ ] with the velocity @xmath34 of the spin modes.@xcite the corresponding exponents can be expressed in terms of the ( momentum independent ) interaction potential . for small interactions and @xmath35 , @xmath15 shows _ power - law singularities _ at @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] instead of a single ( lorentzian ) peak which would emerge in a fermi liquid .",
    "this is one of the signatures of spin - charge separation regarded as a hallmark of ( spinful ) lls . in ref .",
    "it was shown that these features can be found in the exact spectral function of the tlm if a box - like potential @xmath38 is assumed , as long as @xmath39 with the momentum transfer cutoff @xmath40 .",
    "we emphasize that using a box potential is per se not equivalent to the ad hoc procedure , as it can e.g. be seen considering @xmath29 for @xmath41.@xcite for @xmath39 the box potential might , however , be viewed as a unique realization of the ad hoc procedure ( see below ) .",
    "clearly , a box potential is rather special and might not even be considered as particular physical .",
    "thus further work for more generic @xmath0 is required .    in ref .",
    "it was shown that the algebraic properties of the green functions @xmath9 in the space - time plane are significantly affected by the ad hoc procedures .",
    "it was proven that the exponent of the asymptotic decay of the green function in the distinguished directions @xmath42 is not only set by @xmath21 but in addition by a measure of the flatness of the potential at @xmath43 ; a result which can not be obtained within any ad hoc procedure . based on this and the crucial insight that the decay of @xmath9 in the distinguished directions plays a central role in obtaining the power - law nonanalyticities in @xmath29 ,",
    "the question was posed if for generic @xmath0 , @xmath29 is characterized by the ` thought to be universal ' power laws of the ad hoc procedure . however ,",
    ".   lacks a definite answer .",
    "the above mentioned box potential is ` infinitely flat ' at @xmath43 and thus ` nongeneric ' .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath9 for this and the ad hoc procedures agree and consequently also the features of @xmath29 at @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "it is crucial to realize that a dependence of the line shape of @xmath29 on the details of the interaction away from @xmath5 including such fundamental issues as the presence or absence of algebraic nonanalyticities does not contradict the rg irrelevance of the momentum dependence of @xmath0 in the tlm . from this",
    ", universality can only be deduced if _ all _ energy scales are sent to zero ( see above ) .",
    "a fixed @xmath45 sets a scale which becomes active for all generic @xmath0 with @xmath46 for some @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the @xmath49-th derivative .",
    "thus @xmath29 can not expected to be universal on general grounds .",
    "in fact , a finite scale will destroy the scale invariance of the model and thus ` quantum critical ' power - law scaling . in the case of the at @xmath5 ` infinitely flat ' box potential this mechanism is not active as long as @xmath39 .",
    "we here supplement ref .   and provide very strong evidence that the spectral function of the tlm at fixed @xmath45 and for a generic potential is not characterized by power laws .",
    "the latter are only found if @xmath50 . to guide the reader we should from the outset",
    "be very precise about our understanding of ` power - law scaling ' .",
    "we say that some real function @xmath51 shows power - law scaling with exponent @xmath52 close to @xmath53 from above if @xmath54 approaches @xmath52 for @xmath55 .",
    "a similar definition can be given for power - law scaling from below .",
    "this does of course not exclude that @xmath51 can to some degree be approximated by a power law or ` resembles ' a power law for some range of @xmath6 ( close to @xmath56 ) even if it does not fulfill the above criterion .",
    "we will return to this in sects .",
    "[ sect_g4 ] and [ sect_g2_g4 ] in which we present our results for @xmath29 .",
    "more generally , we show that even for @xmath57 the spectral line shape depends on the details of @xmath0 .",
    "although the present study might be regarded as somewhat technical  or even pedantic given that issues of the momentum dependence of @xmath0 in the tlm are virtually always nonchalantly ignored  our results have far reaching consequences .",
    "the first implication of our results concerns the concept of ll universality .",
    "while @xmath58 of _ any _ model from the ll universality class shows the power - law suppression of spectral weight for @xmath18 and @xmath59 a power - law peak or suppression at the same energy , _ ll universality does not predict power laws in _",
    "@xmath29 for fixed @xmath45 .",
    "evidently , if this type of universality can not be proven in the low - energy fixed point model , the tlm , it can not be a characteristic feature of the ll universality class .",
    "this does of course not exclude that _",
    "certain models _ from the ll universality class might show such power laws , however , if so for _ more specific reasons than ll universality .",
    "_ an obvious example for this is the tlm with box potential.@xcite other examples might be based upon the restriction of the ( equilibrium ) dynamics encountered in specific 1d models with an extensive number of local conserved quantities ( e.g. the hubbard model ) which are often bethe ansatz solvable.@xcite a detailed discussion in which we relate our results to spectra of 1d lattice models obtained by either analytical or numerical approaches is given in sect .",
    "[ sect_con_llun ] .    strongly linked to this",
    "are the implications of our findings for recent results on @xmath29 taking the nonlinearity of the single - particle dispersion in to account@xcite which are embedded in the framework of the so - called ` nonlinear ll phenomenology'.@xcite in this power laws are not viewed as originating from quantum critical scale invariance but rather as resulting from a fermi edge singularity like effect . in the phenomenological construction of the effective field theory including curvature effects of the dispersion the above described ad hoc regularization is employed .",
    "the spectral function is computed for this field theory .",
    "our results obtained for _ linear _ ll theory raise the question whether the power laws found in ` nonlinear ll phenomenology ' are robust against a curvature of the bulk two - particle potential .",
    "we emphasize that these power laws are specific to the nonlinearity of the dispersion , which e.g. leads to momentum dependent exponents , and are thus different from the nonanalyticities found for the tlm treated within the ad hoc procedure ( or , for that matter , the tlm with box potential ) .",
    "again this does of course not exclude that for _ specific 1d models , _",
    "e.g. bethe ansatz solvable lattice models , power laws with momentum dependent exponents might be realized .",
    "more on this is can be found in sect .",
    "[ sect_con_nonlinll ] .    finally , our findings are of importance for the interpretation of experimental momentum resolved spectra . even after decades of research none of the photoemission experiments on quasi 1d metals reporting on the observation of dispersing spin and charge peaks remains unchallenged.@xcite one reason for this is that , when interpreting experimental data in the light of ll physics , the momentum resolved spectral function obtained within the tlm employing an ad hoc regularization is taken paradigmatically .",
    "crucially , we find spin and charge peaks for generic @xmath0 and a sufficiently small amplitude of the two - particle interaction even though they are not given by power - law singularities .",
    "our results show , however , that details are model dependent ( in our case @xmath0 dependent ) and therefore nonuniversal .",
    "thus the detailed spectral features of the ad hoc regularized tlm can not expected to be found in experimental spectra .",

    "accordingly , @xmath392 increases . as for the above",
    "discussed limiting cases of the spinful @xmath60- and the spinless @xmath61-@xmath60-model , the details of the spectral line shape obviously depend on the details of the two - particle potential [ compare figs .",

    "the integral over @xmath393 at fixed @xmath284 must be normalized to 1 which implies that for the exponential potential less spectral weight is transferred to @xmath394 ( not shown ) than for the gaussian one . for the former the ` charge peak '",
    "is fairly broad and has an unusal line shape .",
    "however , the two sets of spectra also share similarities .",
    "for increasing interaction the spin peak loses weight and deforms into a shoulder like structure . to summarize",
    ", we expect spin - charge separation to be a robust feature of quasi-1d metalls which should be observable in photoemission experiments ."
