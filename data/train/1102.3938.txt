    "thermodynamics is not fundamentally a theory of energy distribution , but a theory of statistical degeneracy  @xcite . as such ,",
    "while most of our experience and intuition about thermodynamics is drawn from equilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite , which emphasizes the role of energy , we should expect that its fundamental principles apply in much wider domains , outside equilibrium , and even outside mechanics .    within the last 50 years",
    ", a clear conceptual understanding of the nature of thermodynamic descriptions  @xcite has combined with new methods to analyze a wide variety of stochastic processes , for continuous  @xcite and discrete systems  @xcite , in quantum  @xcite and classical mechanics  @xcite , both at and away from equilibrium , and even in other areas using information theory such as optimal data compression and reliable communication  @xcite , and via these , robust molecular recognition  @xcite .",
    "these developments confirm that thermodynamics is indeed not restricted to equilibrium or to mechanics .",
    "they give us insight into when thermodynamic descriptions should exist , and they provide systematic methods to construct such descriptions in a wide variety of situations .",
    "this paper reviews the aspects of large - numbers scaling and structural decomposition that are essential to thermodynamic descriptions , and presents examples from which each of these may be seen in different forms that are appropriate to equilibrium and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "it also brings together construction methods ( based on generating functions  ) , scaling relations ( based on ray approximations  @xcite ) , and variational methods ( based on functional legendre transforms  @xcite ) , which will enable the reader to systematically construct the fluctuation theorems of thermodynamic descriptions from their underlying stochastic processes .",
    "the entropy , as a logarithmic measure of degeneracy , is the central quantity in thermodynamics .",
    "it arises as the leading term in the log - probability for fluctuations of averaged quantities . at the same time , however , when sub - system components , or a system and its environment , interact , they discover their most probable joint configuration through fluctuations .",
    "therefore the competition among entropy terms also reflects the structure of system interactions at the macroscale .",
    "we are reminded of the importance of this structural role of entropies , by the fact that pure `` classical '' thermodynamics  @xcite is entirely devoted to the analysis of entropy gradients .",
    "therefore we wish to insist on being able to decompose entropy into its sub - system components as a criterion for any fully - developed thermodynamic description .    the key property that defines the existence of thermodynamic limits , and the form of their fluctuation theorems , is large - deviations scaling  @xcite .",
    "it is the precise statement of the simplification provided by the law of large numbers , not only in the infinite limit of aggregation , but in the asymptotic approach to infinity .",
    "it is well - known that averaging over ensembles of configurations for large systems removes almost all ( irrelevant ) degrees of freedom , and leaves only summary statistics , which are the _ state variables _ of the thermodynamic description . in finite systems",
    ", these summary statistics can still show sample fluctuation , but in the thermodynamic limit , the fluctuation probability takes a simple form .    for an ensemble that possesses large - deviations scaling , it is possible to describe classes of fluctuations as having the same structure under different degrees of aggregation .",
    "( an example would be fractional density fluctuations in regions of a gas , whose sample volume may be varied ) .",
    "the log - probability for any such fluctuation then _ factors _ , into a term that depends on overall system scale , and a scale - invariant coefficient that depends only on the structure of the fluctuation .",
    "the scale - invariant coefficient is called the _ rate function _ of the large - deviations scaling relation  @xcite .",
    "( an example would be the specific entropy of a gas . )",
    "large - deviations scaling presumes the existence of a _ separation of scales _  between microscopic processes and their macroscopic descriptions  over which aggregation does not lead to qualitative changes in the kinds of fluctuations that can occur . we expect thermodynamic limits to exist where this separation of scales is large",
    ". examples of structural change that can interrupt simple scaling under the law of large numbers include phase transitions , which can change the space of accessible excitations .",
    "large - deviations scaling permits us to combine fluctuation statistics with entropy decompositions that reflect system structure . in equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "the result is the classical fluctuation theorem for macrostates  @xcite : the log - probability for fluctuations ( of energy , volume , particles , etc . ) between sub - systems with well - defined entropies is the difference between the sum of entropies at the fluctuating value and the maximum value for this sum , which is the equilibrium value .",
    "if we wish to consider the probabilities of fluctuations with more complex structure ( whether in equilibrium thermodynamics or in more complicated cases ) , we will need more flexible methods to compute large - deviations formulae and entropy decompositions .",
    "for this , we introduce the notion of the _ stochastic effective action _ , which is defined by variational methods that generalize the familiar legendre transform of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the meaning of this quantity , and the way it is used , will be most easily understood by following its construction in the body of the paper , so we postpone further discussion until that point .",
    "we will develop examples whose purpose is to show that the definition and properties of the entropy do not change as we extend thermodynamics beyond equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "rather , what changes is the state space to which we assign probabilities .",
    "a direct example comes from comparing an equilibrium thermodynamic system , to a non - equilibrium description constructed for the same system .",
    "a frequent approach   to non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ( nesm ) continues to use the equilibrium state variables and equilibrium entropy , but considers their time rates of change .",
    "we will see that such an approach , focused on retaining the functional form of the equilibrium entropy , sacrifices its meaning as a large - deviations rate function .    instead",
    ", we will make the transition from equilibrium to non - equilibrium statistical mechanics by replacing an ensemble of states ( in equilibrium ) by an ensemble in which entire time - dependent trajectories  termed _ histories _  are the elementary entities ( for nesm ) , and then we will construct the appropriate large - deviations limits for the ensemble of histories .",
    "the functional form of the entropy will necessarily change .",
    "more importantly , the inventory of _ state variables _ will necessarily be enlarged , to include not only the configuration variables of equilibrium , but also a collection of currents that relate to the changes in configuration .",
    "both kinds of variables will be needed as summary statistics for an ensemble of histories , and both will enter as arguments in the non - equilibrium entropy .",
    "nesm is not so far removed from equilibrium thermodynamics that it can really do justice to the generality of large - deviations principles and thermodynamic descriptions .",
    "however , it allows us to begin with a completely familiar ( equilibrium ) construction , then to compare it to a construction with rather different functional forms , and finally to derive the complete set of relations that connect the two descriptions .",
    "markovian stochastic processes  @xcite provide a general , substrate - independent framework within which to study statistical degeneracy and large - deviations scaling .",
    "they include models from statistical mechanics , but they may also be used to represent many other random processes , whose structure may have different constraints and interpretations from those of mechanics .",
    "this review will use the two - state random walk , in either discrete or continuous time , as a sample system for which equilibrium and non - equilibrium thermodynamic descriptions will be built and then compared .",
    "the two - state random walk is the simplest discrete stochastic process , and most thermodynamic quantities of interest in both ensembles can be computed for this system in closed form .",
    "however , the constructions in the examples immediately generalize to more complicated cases , and several generalizations and approximation methods will be covered either in the main text or in appendices .    sec .  [",
    "sec : lg_dev_scaling ] will introduce large - deviations scaling one level `` below '' the discrete random walk , by supposing that the discrete model emerges as a coarse - grained description from the continuous random walk in a double - well potential .",
    "the continuum model illustrates the concept of _ concentration of measure _ from large - deviations theory , and sets the parameters ( both explicit and implicit ) that define the discrete model .",
    "it also clarifies the nature and origin of the `` local - equilibrium '' approximation  @xcite for coarse - grained descriptions of motion on free - energy landscapes , and illustrates graphically the dual roles that charges and currents must have in non - equilibrium entropy principles .",
    "sections  [ sec : eq_large_dev ] and  [ sec : neq_fw_large_dev ] present the equilibrium thermodynamics of the two - state model , and its most direct generalization through the master equation of the stochastic process . sec .",
    "[ sec : eq_large_dev ] uses the exact solution of the equilibrium distribution to introduce all basic quantities of the large - deviations theory , and derives these using generating functions and their associated variational methods .",
    "[ sec : neq_fw_large_dev ] then presents the same construction for the time - dependent probability distribution , in which histories of particle counts rather than counts at a single time are the elementary entities .",
    "neither of these ensembles distinguishes particle identities , either in states or in trajectories .",
    "[ sec : caliber ] presents an alternative construction of a thermodynamics of histories based on the entropy of distinguishable - particle trajectories , and this second construction naturally separates the path entropy from probability terms due to the environment , in a form exactly analogous to the gibbs free energy for equilibrium .",
    "the remainder of the introduction lists sources for the particular methods used in later sections , and explains why they capture different aspects of a full non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "many aspects of the following derivations  the naturalness of the generating - function representation , the role of operator algebras and linear algebra more generally , or the information conditions and counting statistics that relate one ensemble to another  may be understood in conceptual terms that are more fundamental than the particular constructions in which they appear below .",
    "we return to these in the discussion , making use of examples from the text .",
    "numerous , diverse literatures now contribute to the understanding of methods closely related to those used below .",
    "a brief summary of the history and connections among the ideas , and a broader set of citations , are provided in app .",
    "[ sec : literature ] .",
    "the extension of large - deviations scaling to ensembles of histories is given by * freidlin - wentzell ( f - w ) theory *  @xcite .",
    "this approach is widely applied to the computation of escape trajectories and first - passage times  .",
    "it is remarkable for the way it reduces both problems of inference , and the description of multiscale dynamics , to a representation which is a hamiltonian dynamical system  @xcite .",
    "a convenient method for arriving at the hamiltonian description of f - w theory is the * doi - peliti ( d - p ) construction *   based on generating functionals .",
    "the d - p construction is only one of many closely - related methods based on expansions in coherent states , which are reviewed in app .",
    "[ sec : literature ] .",
    "these methods   have the common feature that the field representing sample - mean values of observables is augmented by a conjugate momentum that generates the change in those observables .",
    "this value / momentum pair leads to the f - w hamiltonian description .",
    "the d - p method is particular to stochastic processes with independent , discrete number counts , but may readily be generalized to continuous or non - independent observables  @xcite , as well as having many parallels in dissipative quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the f - w method directly gives the scale factors and rate functions of the large - deviations limit for histories .",
    "however , it does not generally decompose fluctuation probabilities into separate terms representing sub - system components or system - environment interactions , which we want as part of a thermodynamic description . to produce that decomposition , we introduce a path - entropy method due to jaynes known as * maximum caliber *  @xcite , which has its roots in much older analysis of the entropy rates of stochastic processes and chaotic dynamical systems due to kolmogorov and others .",
    "in addition to making the f - w representation more recognizable as a direct counterpart to the constructions in equilibrium thermodynamics , the maximum - caliber method will separate those events that involve energy exchange with the environment from those that do not , allowing us to understand the role of energy dissipation in large - deviations formulae for paths .      in characterizing thermodynamic ensembles",
    ", we will need to make three choices about the level of representation , and the basis used :    1 .",
    "whether we are referring to ensemble averages ( hence , deterministic summary statistics ) , or quantities that fluctuate stochastically to represent the process of sampling ; 2 .   whether we are considering discrete samples that change in the integer basis of particle counts , or modes of collective fluctuation , which we describe with the continuous mean values of poisson distributions ; 3 .",
    "whether we are describing absolute particle numbers distributed among states , or are separating total number as a scaling variable , from the fractional distributions of particles that have a scale - invariant meaning .",
    "different choices will lead to objects with quite different mathematical behavior , even if all of them represent particle numbers in one way or another .",
    "the notation in the following sections is chosen to reflect the three choices above , while still permitting readable equations .",
    "ensemble averages of any quantities are denoted by overbars .",
    "this convention is easier to incorporate in complicated equations than the @xmath0 ( for expectation value ) commonly used in statistics .",
    "the remaining distinctions in the notation are summarized in table  [ tab : social_makeup ] .    [ cols= \" < ,",
    ", < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : social_makeup ]    it will be important , in following the doi - peliti construction below , to understand that math - italic @xmath1 are the mean values of poisson distributions that are used as a _ basis _ in which to expand the actual distribution that evolves under the stochastic process .",
    "they remain random variables that are sampled from the ensemble , but they fluctuate with langevin statistics rather than the poisson statistics of the integer particle counts @xmath2 .",
    "the ensemble mean will be denoted @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamics of a stochastic process may be represented in three ways associated with these different bases , which contain equivalent information and which will all be illustrated in the following sections .",
    "these are : 1 ) the transfer matrix of the discrete stochastic process , which shifts probability among indices ; 2 ) the liouville operator that acts on generating functions , shifting probability among modes ; and 3 ) the action functional of the doi - peliti field - theoretic expansion in poisson distributions , which generates the covariance for langevin statistics .",
    "we will show that , with a suitable choice of dynamical variables , one may skip over the laborious task of interconverting these representations , and simply copy the functional forms from one representation to another . the number variables and",
    "shift operators in table  [ tab : social_makeup ] are those that substitute for one another under changes of representation .",
    "in later sections , the two - state random walk will be the microscopic model , whose thermodynamic descriptions we seek . in this section",
    "we will take an even lower - level random walk in a continuum potential to be the microscopic model , for which the two - state model is the coarse - grained thermodynamic description .",
    "starting in the continuum will allow us to relate the dual ( charge / current ) character of non - equilibrium thermodynamic state variables to graphical features of the underlying free - energy landscape .",
    "the particular class of continuum models we will consider  landscapes with basins and barriers  also lead to the asymmetry between states and kinetics in classical discrete stochastic processes , and to the nature of the local - equilibrium approximation in such models .",
    "the main points of the section will be : 1 ) the way large - deviations scaling isolates the fixed points of a stochastic dynamical system as its control points ; 2 ) the difference between the relevant sets of fixed points for equilibrium versus non - equilibrium ensembles ; and 3 ) the way the static and kinetic properties of the underlying system become encoded in the discrete representation .",
    "we will also cover the origin of the natural scale for a discrete stochastic process , which is never expressed directly within the discrete model , but which can be necessary to regulate and to understand divergences when its stochastic behavior is analyzed .",
    "entropy characterizes probabilities for systems that we describe completely ( called `` closed '' systems ) , while _ free energies _ characterize probabilities for systems coupled to incompletely - described environments .",
    "a review of the basic relations of probability to entropy and free energy in classical equilibrium thermodynamics is given in app .",
    "[ sec : free_energies ] .    in this and later sections ,",
    "we will write probabilities of states , and transition rates , in terms of _ gibbs free energies _  @xcite . the free energy representation is not linked to any particular scale , and so provides the map from a continuum potential for a stochastic particle to the parameters of its discrete - state approximation .",
    "this representation becomes particularly powerful for extensions from single - particle motion , to the conversion of several species of particles in fixed proportion , which occurs in chemical reaction networks ( considered in app .",
    "[ sec : multi_part_react ] ) .",
    "the origin of free energies need not be mechanical ; such a representation may be found for any stochastic process that satisfies detailed balance in its stationary state .",
    "free energies will also provide a way to interpret the generating functions and functionals used in later sections .",
    "a generating function distorts the free energy landscape by changing the one - particle free energies of stable states and transitions .",
    "we will see that the momentum variables that appear in the freidlin - wentzell theory are precisely the distortions of free energy landscapes that extract the _ past histories _ most likely to lead to fluctuation conditions imposed at any moment .",

    ", this trajectory is always the time - reverse of the classical diffusion trajectory from the maximum to the minimum .",
    "the most - probable trajectory for any escape requires a specific finite time , which will limit the frequencies at which we can use coarse - grained approximations . in one dimension , the escape time equals the classical diffusive relaxation time over the path whose time - reverse is the escape .",

    "[ sec : caliber ] .",
    "this fact will be essential to understanding `` maximum - entropy production ''   as an approximation but not a principle for non - equilibrium systems .",
    "second , we note that the asymmetry between states and kinetics need not be a property of free energy landscapes if they do not have basins and barriers . in particular , it may not be a property of free diffusion , and it is generally not a property of driven dissipative quantum ensembles  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the underlying continuum model does not have the features that create asymmetry , we have no ground to expect that even the charge - valued state variables in the non - equilibrium theory will closely resemble those in the corresponding equilibrium limit .",

    "[ sec : caliber ] that such sources lead to divergences in individual entropy terms that should remain finite to be meaningful .",
