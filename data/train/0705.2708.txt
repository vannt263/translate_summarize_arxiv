    "neutron stars in x - ray binaries accrete material from a companion star and flare to life with a burst of x - rays . the most rapidly rotating , currently known neutron star is pulsar psr j1748 - 2446ad , which rotates at a period of 1.39  ms ( which corresponds to a rotational frequency of 719  hz ) @xcite .",
    "it is followed by psrs b1937 + 21 @xcite and b1957 + 20 @xcite whose rotational periods are 1.58 ms ( 633  hz ) and 1.61  ms ( 621  hz ) , respectively .",
    "finally , the recent discovery of x - ray burst oscillations from the neutron star x - ray transient xte j1739285 @xcite could suggest that xte j1739285 contains the most rapidly rotating neutron star yet discovered .",
    "measurements of radio pulsars and neutron stars in x - ray binaries comprise most of the neutron star observations .",
    "improved data on isolated neutron stars ( e.g. 1856 , ) are now becoming available , and future investigations at gravitational wave observatories focus on neutron stars as major potential sources of gravitational waves ( see @xcite for a recent overview ) .",
    "depending on star mass and rotational frequency , the matter in the core regions of neutron stars may be compressed to densities that are up to an order of magnitude greater than the density of ordinary atomic nuclei .",
    "this extreme compression provides a high - pressure environment in which numerous subatomic particle processes are likely to compete with each other @xcite .",
    "the most spectacular ones stretch from the generation of hyperons and baryon resonances ( @xmath0 ) , to quark ( @xmath1 ) deconfinement , to the formation of boson    condensates ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , h - matter ) @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : crossection ] ) . in the framework of the strange matter hypothesis @xcite , it has also been suggested that 3-flavor strange quark matter  made of absolutely stable @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 quarks  may be more stable than ordinary atomic nuclei . in the latter event ,",
    "neutron stars should in fact be made of such matter rather than ordinary ( confined ) hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "another striking implication of the strange matter hypothesis is the possible existence of a new class of white - dwarfs - like strange stars ( strange dwarfs ) @xcite .",
    "the quark matter in neutron stars , strange stars , or strange dwarfs ought to be in a color superconducting state @xcite .",
    "this fascinating possibility has renewed tremendous interest in the physics of neutron stars and the physics and astrophysics of ( strange ) quark matter @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses the possible phases of ultra - dense nuclear matter expected to exist deep inside neutron stars and reviews selected models derived for the equation of state ( eos ) of such matter ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in 1939 , tolman , oppenheimer and volkoff performed the first neutron star calculations , assuming that such objects are entirely made of a gas of non - interacting relativistic neutrons @xcite .",
    "the eos  of such a gas is extremely soft , i.e.  very little additional pressure is gained with increasing density , as can be seen from fig.[fig : nucl_eoss ] , and predicts a    maximum neutron star mass of just @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mvsr ] ) at an unrealistically high density of 17 times the density of nuclear matter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ec ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the inclusion of interactions among the neutrons increases the star s maximum mass from @xmath7 to around @xmath8 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : mvsr ] and [ fig : ec ] ) .",
    "however , the radii of the latter are so big that mass shedding from the star s equator occurs at rotational frequencies that are considerably smaller than those observed for psr  j1748 - 2446ad , 716  hz ( 1.39  ms ) @xcite , or b1937 + 21 , 630  hz ( 1.58  ms ) @xcite .",
    "an interacting neutron gas thus fails to accommodate the observed rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "the other extreme , a non - interacting relativistic neutron gas , fails too since it does not accommodate the hulse - taylor pulsar ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , and also conflicts with the average neutron star mass of @xmath10 derived by thorsett and chakrabarty @xcite from observations of radio pulsar systems .",
    "more than that , recent observations indicate that neutron star masses may be as high as around @xmath11 .",

    "large masses have also been reported for the high - mass x - ray binary 4u170037 and the compact object in the low - mass x - ray binary 2s0921630 , @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite . respectively",
    ". the latter two objects may be either massive neutron stars or low - mass black holes with masses slightly higher than the maximum possible neutron star mass of @xmath18 .",
    "this value follows from a general , theoretical estimate of the maximal possible mass of a stable neutron star as performed by rhoades and ruffini @xcite on the basis that ( 1 ) einstein s theory of general relativity is the correct theory of gravity , ( 2 ) the eos  satisfies both the microscopic stability condition @xmath19 and the causality condition @xmath20 , and ( 3 ) that the eos  below some matching density is known . from these assumptions , it follows that the maximum mass of the equilibrium configuration of a neutron star can not be larger than @xmath21 .",
    "this value increases to about @xmath22 if one abandons the causality constraint @xmath23 @xcite , since it allows the eos  to behave stiffer at asymptotically high nuclear densities .",
    "if either one of the two objects 4u170037 or 2s0921630 were a black hole , it would confirm the prediction of the existence of low - mass black holes @xcite .",
    "conversely , if these objects were massive neutron stars , their high masses would severely constrain the eos  of dense nuclear matter .",
    "a vast number of models for the equation of state of neutron star matter has been derived in the literature over the years .",

    "the thresholds of the lightest baryon resonances ( @xmath32 ) are not reached in relativistic mean - field ( hartree ) calculations .",
    "this is different for many - body calculations performed at the relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock level , where @xmath33 s appear very abundantly @xcite . in any event",

    "otherwise energy and momentum can not be conserved simultaneously for these reactions so that they are forbidden . for a neutron star made up of only nucleons and electrons ,",
    "it is rather straightforward to show that the critical proton fraction is around @xmath57 .",

    "in most cases , the nucleon direct urca process is more efficient than the ones involving hyperons @xcite .",
    "the condensation of negatively charged mesons in neutron star matter is favored because such mesons would replace electrons with very high fermi momenta .",

    "the condensation is initiated by the schematic reaction @xmath74 . if this reaction becomes possible in neutron star matter , it is energetically advantageous to replace the fermionic electrons with the bosonic @xmath3 mesons . whether or not this happens depends on the behavior of the @xmath3 mass , @xmath75 , in neutron star matter .",

    "the relative isospin symmetric composition achieved in this way resembles the one of atomic nuclei , which are made up of roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons .",
    "neutron stars are therefore referred to , in this picture , as nucleon stars .",
    "the maximum mass of such stars has been calculated to be around @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the collapsing core of a supernova , e.g.  1987a , if heavier than this value , should go into a black hole rather than forming a neutron star , as pointed out by brown et al .",
    "this would imply the existence of a large number of low - mass black holes in our galaxy @xcite .",

    "the pentaquark decays according to @xmath95 + n[udd]$ ] and thus has the same quantum numbers as the @xmath96 .",
    "the associated reaction in chemically equilibrated matter would imply @xmath97 .",
    "it has been suggested already many decades ago @xcite that the nucleons may melt under the enormous pressure that exists in the cores of neutron stars , creating a new state of matter know as quark matter . from simple geometrical considerations",
    "it follows that for a characteristic nucleon radius of @xmath98  fm , nucleons may begin to touch each other in nuclear matter at densities around @xmath99 , which is less than twice the density of nuclear matter .",
    "this figure increases to @xmath100 for a nucleon radius of @xmath101  fm .",
    "one may thus speculate that the hadrons of neutron star matter begin to dissolve at densities somewhere between around @xmath102 , giving way to unconfined quarks .",
    "depending on rotational frequency and neutron star mass , densities greater than two to three times @xmath103 are easily reached in the cores of neutron stars so that the neutrons and protons in the cores of neutron stars may indeed be broken up into their quark constituents @xcite .",
    "more than that , since the mass of the strange quark is only @xmath104  mev , high - energetic up and down quarks will readily transform to strange quarks at about the same density at which up and down quark deconfinement sets in .",
    "thus , if quark matter exists in the cores of neutron stars , it should be made of the three lightest quark flavors .",
    "a possible astrophysical signal of quark deconfinement in the cores of neutron stars was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the remaining three quark flavors ( charm , top , bottom ) are way to massive to be created in neutron stars . for instance",
    ", the creation of charm quark requires a density greater than @xmath105 , which is around 100 times greater than the density reached in neutron stars .",
    "a stability analysis of stars with a charm quark population reveals that such objects are unstable against radial oscillations and , thus , can not exist stably in the universe @xcite . the same is true for ultra - compact stars with unconfined populations of top and bottom quarks , since the pulsation eigen - equations are of sturm - liouville type .",

    "fig : sequences ] .      the electrons",
    "surrounding strange quark matter are held to quark matter electrostatically . since neither component , electrons and quark matter ,",
    "is held in place gravitationally , the eddington limit to the luminosity that a static surface may emit does not apply , and thus the object may have photon luminosities much greater than @xmath166 .",
    "it was shown by usov @xcite that this value may be exceeded by many orders of magnitude by the luminosity of @xmath167 pairs produced by the coulomb barrier at the surface of a hot strange star . for a surface temperature of @xmath168",
    "k , the luminosity in the outflowing pair plasma was calculated to be as high as @xmath169 .",
    "such an effect may be a good observational signature of bare strange stars @xcite .",
    "if the strange star is enveloped by a nuclear crust however , which is gravitationally bound to the strange star , the surface made up of ordinary atomic matter would be subject to the eddington limit .",
    "hence the photon emissivity of such a strange star would be the same as for an ordinary neutron star .",
    "if quark matter at the stellar surface is in the cfl phase the process of @xmath167 pair creation at the stellar quark matter surface may be turned off , since cold cfl quark matter is electrically neutral so that no electrons are required and none are admitted inside cfl quark matter @xcite .",
    "this may be different for the early stages of a hot cfl quark star @xcite .",
    "here we take a brief look at the composition of proto - neutron star matter .",
    "the composition is determined by the requirements of charge neutrality and equilibrium under the weak processes , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are baryons , and @xmath174 is a lepton , either an electron or a muon . for standard neutron star matter , where the neutrinos have left the system ,",
    "these two requirements imply that @xmath175 ( electric charge neutrality ) and @xmath176 ( chemical equilibrium ) , where @xmath177 denotes the electric charge density of a given particle , and @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) is the baryon ( lepton ) number density .",
    "the subscript @xmath180 runs over all the baryons considered .",
    "the symbol @xmath181    0.1 cm    refers to the chemical potential of baryon @xmath180 , @xmath182 is the particle s baryon number , and @xmath123 is its charge .",
    "the chemical potential of the neutron is denoted by @xmath183 .",
    "when the neutrinos are trapped , as it is the case for proto - neutron star matter , the chemical equilibrium condition is altered to @xmath184 and @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the chemical potential of the neutrino @xmath187 . in proto - neutron star matter , the electron lepton number @xmath188 is initially fixed at a value of around @xmath189 as suggested by gravitational collapse calculations of massive stars .",
    "also , because no muons are present when neutrinos are trapped , the constraint @xmath190 can be imposed .",
    "figures [ fig : hotpnsm ] and [ fig : hotnsm ] show sample compositions of proto - neutron star matter and standard neutron star matter ( no neutrinos ) computed for the relativistic mean - field approximation .",
    "the presence of the @xmath33 particle in ( proto ) neutron star matter at finite temperature is striking .",
    "this particle is generally absent in cold neutron star matter treated in the relativistic mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "an absolute limit on rapid rotation is set by the onset of mass shedding from the equator of a rotating star .",
    "however , rotational instabilities in rotating stars , known as gravitational radiation driven instabilities , set a more stringent limit on rapid stellar rotation than mass shedding .",
    "these instabilities originate from counter - rotating surface vibrational modes which at sufficiently high rotational star frequencies are dragged forward , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : grr ] .    in this case gravitational radiation , which inevitably accompanies the aspherical transport of matter , does not damp the instability modes but rather drives them .",
    "viscosity plays the important role of damping these instabilities at a sufficiently reduced rotational frequency such that the viscous damping rate and power in gravity waves are comparable .    0.1 cm    the most critical instability modes that are driven unstable by gravitational radiation are f - modes @xcite and r - modes @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : ogrrvstf ] shows the stable neutron star frequencies if only f - modes were operative in neutron star .",
    "one sees that hot as well as cold neutron stars can rotate at frequencies close to mass shedding , because of the large contributions of shear and bulk viscosity , respectively , for this temperature regime .",
    "the more recently discovered r - mode instability @xcite may change the picture completely , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ogrrvstr ] .",
    "these modes are driven unstable by gravitational radiation over a considerably wider range of angular velocities than the f - modes ( cf .",
    "dashed curve labeled ( @xmath191 ) r - mode instability ) . in stars with cores cooler than @xmath192  k , on the other hand , the r - mode instability may be completely suppressed by the viscosity originating from the presence of hyperons in neutron star matter , so that stable rotation would be limited by the f - mode instability again @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : cfl ] and [ fig:2sc ] are the counterparts to figs.[fig : ogrrvstf ] and [ fig : ogrrvstr ] but calculated for strange stars made of cfl and 2sc quark matter , respectively @xcite .",
    "the r - mode instability seems to rule out that pulsars are cfl strange stars , if the characteristic time scale for viscous damping of r - modes are exponentially increased by factors of @xmath193 as calculated in @xcite .",
    "an energy gap as small as @xmath194  mev was assumed . for much larger gaps of @xmath195  mev , as expected for color superconducting quark matter ( see section [ sec : color ] ) , the entire diagram would be r - mode unstable .",
    "the full curve in fig .  [ fig : cfl ] is calculated for a strange quark mass of @xmath196  mev , the dotted curve for @xmath197  mev .",
    "the box marks the positions of most low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) @xcite , and the crosses denote the most rapidly rotating millisecond pulsars known .",
    "all strange stars above the curves would    .1 cm     spin down on a time scale of hours due to the r - mode instability , in complete contradiction to the observation of millisecond pulsars and lmxbs , which would rule out cfl quark matter in strange stars ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig:2sc ] shows the critical rotation frequencies of quark stars as a function of internal stellar temperature for 2sc quark stars . for such quark stars",
    "the situation is less conclusive .",
    "rapid spin - down , driven by the r - mode gravitational radiation instability , would happen for stars above the curves .",
    "here we consider the possibility that the electric charge density inside compact stars ( neutron stars , strange stars ) is not identically zero . this may be the case , for example , for compact stars accreting ionized hydrogen .",
    "another example are strange quark stars .",
    "they could have electric charge distributions on their surfaces that generate electric fields on the order of @xmath198  v / cm @xcite for ordinary quark matter , and @xmath163  v / cm @xcite if quark matter is a color - superconductor .",
    "although the electric field on strange stars exists only in a very narrow region of space , it is interesting to study the effects of such ultra - high electric fields on the structure of the star .",
    "it has already been shown that the energy densities of ultra - high electric fields can substantially alter the structure ( mass  radius relationship ) of compact stars @xcite , depending on the strength of the electric field .",
    "in contrast to electrically uncharged stars , the energy - momentum tensor of charged stars has two key contributions , the usual matter - energy term plus the energy density term that originates from the electric field .",
    "the latter plays a dual role for compact star physics .",
    "firstly , it acts as an additional source of gravity and , secondly , it introduces coulomb interactions inside the star .",
    "both features can alter the properties of compact stars significantly , as we shall demonstrate below .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to spherically symmetric compact stars .",

    "this will be discussed in more details in the next sections .",
    "as already mentioned at the beginning of this section , strange stars may be expected to carry huge electric fields on their surfaces @xcite .",
    "we want to study the effects of such fields on the overall structure of strange stars .",

    "the reason being the occurrence of the metric functions in eq .  ( [ q ] ) , which defines the star s total net charge .",

    "* charm quarks do not play a role for neutron star physics , since they become populated at densities which are around 100 times greater than the densities encountered in the cores of neutron stars . while hydrostatically stable , `` charm '' stars are unstable against radial oscillations and , thus",
    ", can not exist stably in the universe @xcite .",
    "* multi - quark states like the h - particle appear to make neutron stars unstable . *",
    "significant populations of @xmath33 s are predicted by relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock calculations , but not by standard mean - field calculations which do not account for dynamical correlations among baryons computed from the relativistic t - matrix equation . * the finite temperatures of proto neutron stars favors the population of @xmath33 s already at the mean - field level .",
    "* the r - modes are of key interest for several reasons : 1 .",

    "why rapidly accreting neutron stars ( lmxb ) spin slowly and within a narrow band , and 3 .",
