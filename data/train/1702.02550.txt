    "nonclassical effects , such as photon antibunching @xcite , squeezing @xcite , or entanglement @xcite , are known for many decades .",
    "their verification , classification , quantification , and application remain challenging tasks of modern quantum optics . for the distinction of genuine quantum interferences from classical optical effects ,",
    "two major techniques have been established .",
    "the first one is the application of various types of nonclassicality criteria based on observable quantities .",
    "the second one is the investigation of different kinds of phase - space distributions .",
    "the implementation of each of these techniques brings along its own characteristic advantages and challenges .",
    "there is a variety of nonclassicality criteria that are suitable for different applications depending on the quantum system or effect under consideration .",
    "some of them consist of an infinite hierarchy of necessary and sufficient nonclassicality probes .",
    "examples are criteria based on characteristic functions , moments , and their combination @xcite . yet",
    ", the full characterization of quantum effects requires the study of all orders of these hierarchies . even though this is impossible in general",
    ", these methods provide a plethora of sufficient nonclassicality conditions to successfully identify various types of quantum effects ; cf . ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "however , low - order criteria may fail to uncover the nonclassical character of particular quantum states .    in such cases",
    ", the investigation of phase - space distributions may be advantageous .",
    "prominent examples are the husimi @xmath1 function @xcite , the wigner function @xcite , the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0 function @xcite , their unification in terms of @xmath2-parameterized quasi - probability distributions @xcite , or the general distributions introduced by agarwal and wolf @xcite .",
    "nonclassicality is commonly defined via comparison of such quasi - probabilities with their classical counterparts .",
    "the widely accepted definition of nonclassicality by titulaer and glauber relies on the @xmath0 function @xcite : whenever @xmath0 can not be interpreted as a classical probability density , i.e. , when it contains negativities , the state is referred to as nonclassical .",
    "hence , this very quasi - probability will be our benchmark to identify quantum effects .",
    "however , the study of the @xmath0 function can become a cumbersome task as it is highly singular for many quantum states @xcite .",
    "in general , an experimental reconstruction of the @xmath0 function is only possible if a proper regularization procedure is introduced @xcite .",
    "based on such a technique , one can also implement a direct sampling approach for the regularized @xmath0 functions @xcite , which yields direct access to the full information on general quantum states .",
    "the @xmath0 function itself represents the full information on the quantum state @xmath3 of a radiation mode at an arbitrary but fixed time in a diagonal representation , @xmath4 with coherent states @xmath5 with complex amplitudes @xmath6 .",
    "yet , correlations between multiple points in time ( i.e. , temporal correlations ) play a fundamental role in quantum optics and quantum information theory . for instance",
    ", the early demonstration of the quantum nature of light via photon antibunching was based on the detection of two - time intensity correlation properties @xcite .",
    "also the photocounting theory depends on multi - time correlation functions of the light field to be measured @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the corresponding field correlations are normal- and time - ordered . in particular ,",
    "this is relevant when the interaction dynamics is described by an explicitly time - dependent hamiltonian or when the radiation field is emitted by atomic sources .",
    "recently , the keldysh - ordered full counting statistics has been studied in the context of negativities of quasi - probabilities @xcite .",
    "early studies of parametric processes in terms of time - dependent correlation functions were given by mollow @xcite .",
    "temporal correlations have also been studied in the quantum dynamical theory of the fluctuations in a degenerate optical parametric oscillator @xcite .",
    "more recently , the multi - mode parametric dynamics has been further investigated by including time - ordering effects @xcite . for an explicitly time - dependent parametric interaction ,",
    "temporal quantum correlations have been also considered in terms of characteristic functions @xcite .",
    "another field where time - ordering is important is the passive filtering of light emitted from atomic sources .",
    "a general theory for the effects of passive optical systems on quantum light was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this context ,",
    "a careful treatment of non - equal - time commutators is crucial .",
    "although such commutation rules are not explicitly known in general , their effects can be handled in a closed form , for details see ch .",
    "2.7 in ref .",
    "yet another example stems from the spectral filtering of quantum light from atomic sources for which spectral squeezing @xcite and spectral intensity correlations @xcite of the atomic resonance fluorescence have been studied to some extend .",
    "temporal correlations are also considered in the framework of the leggett - garg inequalities @xcite  sometimes referred to as _ temporal bell inequalities_. recently , the latter were extended to continuous - variable systems placed in a squeezed state @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the application areas of temporal correlation properties of radiation fields are a wide - ranging field of research @xcite .",
    "hence , a complete characterization of such correlations is a subject of broad interest .    also for applications of time - dependent quantum correlations of light in quantum technology ,",
    "a full characterization of such complex quantum effects is indispensable . for this purpose ,",
    "a space - time - dependent phase - space representation has been introduced by generalizing the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0 function to a space - time - dependent @xmath0 functional @xcite .",
    "this functional renders it possible to formulate an infinite set of nonclassicality conditions in terms of normal- and time - ordered field correlation functions , which are accessible by homodyne correlation measurements @xcite .",
    "however , such a verification of quantum correlations is hardly used as it requires the detection of a manifold of correlation functions .    in conclusion",
    ", a direct study of the @xmath0 functional would be favorable and would lead to a deep and general understanding of temporal quantum correlations .",
    "however , even for a single time , the @xmath0 functional can be highly singular . even more severely , the singularities of the multi - time @xmath0 functional are even not clearly understood yet .",
    "although it is well known that the singularities of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0 function are caused by the normal - ordering prescription , it is  to our best knowledge  presently unknown whether or not the time - ordering prescription , occurring in the @xmath0 functional , can give rise to stronger singularities than those of a multi - mode ( but single - time ) @xmath0 function . in our recent contribution @xcite , we formulated nonclassicality tests to uncover time - dependent quantum effects .",
    "this method was based on the characteristic function , i.e. , the fourier transform of the @xmath0 functional , which is indeed a regular function .",
    "still , until now , a proper regularization procedure for the @xmath0 functional itself has not been established for the multi - time case .",
    "such a method , however , would be important for a comprehensive understanding and potential applications of general quantum correlations of radiation fields . here",
    ", it is also noteworthy that the general quantum correlations under study even include entanglement as a subset @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we develop a rigorous formalism that describes nonclassical multi - time correlations in terms of smooth nonclassicality quasi - probabilities .",
    "the regularity of our phase - space function applies to any evolution of the optical system .",
    "this enables us to verify quantum effects through the negativity of our quasi - probability representation for quantum states of general radiation fields .",
    "for example , we apply our method to an explicitly time - dependent parametric process .",
    "it is shown that the multi - time scenario implies stronger singularities of the @xmath0 functional than those of the single - time multi - mode @xmath0 function .",
    "even those singularities are suppressed by our regularization technique . eventually , we formulate the measurement theory for the direct sampling of the regularized @xmath0 functional , which allows for an experimental visualization of multi - time quantum correlations of light in phase space .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : nc ] recapitulates the concept of single- and multi - time nonclassicality . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quasiprob ] , we formulate the regularization procedure of the multi - time - dependent @xmath0 functional .",
    "afterwards , in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] , we apply the introduced techniques to the scenario of an optical parametric process with frequency mismatch . in sec .",
    "[ sec : measurement ] , we propose an experimental scheme for efficiently measuring the quantities under study . finally , a summary and some conclusions follow in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the single - time scenario , the @xmath0 function can be used to express any quantum state as a formal mixture of coherent states @xcite , cf .",
    "( [ eq : singlepfunction ] ) . however , it is due to the singular behavior of @xmath0 , which occurs for many quantum states , such as fock or squeezed states , that a direct experimental access to this distribution is impossible .",
    "the singularity is equivalent to an unbounded characteristic function @xmath7 , being the fourier transform of @xmath0 .    to resolve the issue of singularities and to identify the nonclassicality of quantum states in experiments through negativities of properly defined quasi - probabilities , a regularization procedure was introduced @xcite .",
    "the resulting regularized @xmath0 function is consequently defined via the following fourier transform @xmath8 or convolution @xmath9 : @xmath10(\\alpha)=(p \\ast \\tilde{\\omega}_w)(\\alpha ) , \\ ] ] with the filter function @xmath11 or its inverse fourier transform @xmath12 and both depending on a width parameter @xmath13 .",
    "this , in general , non - gaussian filter function needs to satisfy several conditions @xcite :    1 .",
    "@xmath14 is rapidly decaying for all ( finite ) values @xmath15 .",
    "this is necessary to assure that the regularized @xmath0 function exists and is even smooth for all states and for all filter widths ( cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite , appendix a ) .",
    "2 .   the fourier transform @xmath16 is a probability density .",
    "especially , its non - negativity is important as we want to visualize negativities of the original @xmath0 function , which define the nonclassicality .",
    "thus , the filter must not contribute negativities .",
    "the limit @xmath17 assures that the original @xmath0 function is recovered for @xmath18 .",
    "the regularized @xmath19-mode and single - time @xmath0 function is obtained from the generalization @xcite @xmath20(\\boldsymbol\\alpha),\\ ] ] where @xmath21 .",
    "one possibility to construct a multi - mode filter is a product of single - mode filters , @xmath22 .",

    "that is , all creation operators are placed to the left of the annihilation operators without making use of the bosonic commutation relations . as @xmath31=0 $ ] and @xmath32=\\delta_{ij}$ ] hold ( @xmath33 is the kronecker symbol )",
    ", one can use the standard ( i.e. , first - order ) baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) formula to obtain @xmath34 as for the unitary displacement operators @xmath35 holds @xmath36 , one readily verifies eq . .",
    "this estimation also holds true for any time evolution of a quantum state @xmath37 for a single time @xmath38 .",
    "hence , one finds that the slope of the characteristic function of the @xmath19-mode @xmath0 function is bounded by an inverse gaussian factor , which also bounds the singularities of the multi - mode @xmath0 function @xcite .",
    "however , the so far recapitulated regularization procedure is restricted to single - time properties of a quantum system .      in the more general multi - time scenario ,",
    "the situation is very different .",
    "it is nontrivial to give a similar expansion as in eq . , because it is a cumbersome task to define the corresponding multi - time density matrix @xcite .",
    "thus , one needs a generalized , multi - time - dependent version of the @xmath0 function @xcite . we will discuss this concept in the continuation of this section .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 functional is formulated by using normal- and time - ordered expressions which are accessible in quantum correlation measurements @xcite .",
    "they also occur in the photocounting theory @xcite whenever source fields play a significant role in the description of a quantum state of light .",
    "let us consider an observable @xmath39 $ ] , which depends on the bosonic annihilation operators @xmath40 and creation operators @xmath41 ( not explicitly written as an argument in @xmath42 ) at arbitrarily chosen points in time , @xmath43 . throughout this work",

    "the extension to @xmath19 spatial / frequency modes is straightforward , via @xmath45 , as it was exemplified in the previous subsection for a single time .",
    "the definition of the singular @xmath0 functional was introduced in terms of space - time - dependent field operators in ref .",
    "@xcite which already includes the most general scenario .",

    "the symbol @xmath48 represents the normal(@xmath30)- and time(@xmath49)-ordering prescription .",
    "namely , the operators in eq .",

    "note that from the theory of photoelectric detection of light it is well known that observable correlation functions are subjected to normal and time ordering .",
    "an example of such a function is the second - order intensity correlation function , @xmath50 , which corresponds to the expectation value of the operator @xmath51 .",
    "this quantity is essential for the verification of photon antibunching @xcite .    from the general structure of eq .",

    "let us stress the following : the notion @xmath0 function is used for characterizing the quantum state at a single ( arbitrary but fixed ) time .",
    "the notion @xmath0 functional , on the other hand , applies when field amplitudes including their time dependencies are relevant .",
    "this also means that in the case @xmath55 , the time - ordering prescription becomes meaningless , @xmath56 . in this scenario ,",
    "the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0 function in eq . is recovered .",
    "the classicality ( non - negativity ) of the multi - time functional leads to a hierarchy of classical inequalities in term of moments .",
    "their violation certifies general quantum correlations of light @xcite .",
    "special cases were also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for characterizing two - photon quantum interferences .",
    "starting from the definition , one can always express the @xmath0 functional through its characteristic function @xmath7 , @xmath57 = \\mathcal{f}_{\\ { \\beta_i\\}_{i=1}^k }   [ \\phi(\\{\\beta_i ; t_i \\}_{i=1}^k ) ] ( \\{\\alpha_i\\}_{i=1}^k),\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a product of fourier transforms for the @xmath44 different degrees of freedom .",
    "let us recall that the ( time - dependent ) operator - valued @xmath33 distribution is defined as the fourier transform of the ( time - dependent ) displacement operator , @xmath59(\\alpha)}$ ] , with @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "hence , one readily gets that @xmath61 which is the multi - time - dependent characteristic function ( mtcf ) of the @xmath0 functional for @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the operator product for arbitrary @xmath63 is defined as @xmath64 .",
    "since the operators are in general not commuting , the operator products contain the time ordering from the first line in eq . .",
    "at first sight , the above expression resembles the one of the multi - mode characteristic function [ eq . ] . however , there are two significant differences when considering the multi - time scenario :    \\(i ) one needs to consider non - equal - time commutators of the field operators which are , in general , non - vanishing or not even proportional to unity @xcite .",
    "this means @xmath65",
    "\\not \\propto \\hat 1 $ ] for @xmath66 , which is a crucial point as such commutators do not necessarily commute with other operators .",
    "hence , the standard bch formula is insufficient and higher - order terms need to be taken into account .",
    "their calculation and the related convergence considerations are complex problems @xcite which complicates the issue of finding a bound of the absolute square of the mtcf .",
    "this result is a major difference compared to the multi - mode ( single - time ) case [ eq . ] .",
    "\\(ii ) resulting from the structure of the functional , the time - ordering prescription ( beside the normal - ordering prescription ) has to be considered . as we saw in the derivation of eq . , the factor @xmath67 for a single radiation mode is caused by the normal ordering .",
    "the question arises whether or not the time ordering itself does cause a stronger rising behavior of the mtcf .    altogether",
    ", the mtcf may be a more strongly growing function of @xmath68 compared with the single - time but multi - mode scenario . however , this asymptotic behavior is important as it could lead to stronger singularities of the corresponding @xmath0 functional compared with the multi - mode @xmath0 function .",
    "this problem , to our best knowledge , has not been studied yet .",
    "our rigorous regularization procedure in the multi - time scenario has to include this eventuality .",
    "this also means that our approach , to be formulated , needs to be applicable to any dynamics of a quantum optical system .      as emphasized above , the singularities of @xmath0 in eq .",
    "are caused by the fact that the characteristic function @xmath69 [ eq . ] is , in general , unbounded .",

    "let us formulate some simple observations .",
    "we consider a continuous function @xmath74 depending on a real - valued parameter @xmath75 that might diverge for @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , we employ the triangular function , @xmath77 , \\\\              ( 1-z ) & \\text { for } z\\in[0,1 ] , \\\\              0 &   \\text",
    "{ else . }          \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] it holds that the product @xmath78 is bounded and continuous since the product of two continuous functions is continuous and since the triangular function has the compact support @xmath79$]it is identical to zero for @xmath80 .",
    "further on , it is easy to check that the one - dimensional fourier transform of @xmath81 is a probability density . rescaling the argument with @xmath13 , @xmath82 , yields a rescaled probability density , with the support of @xmath82 changing to the interval @xmath83 $ ] . in particular for @xmath18 , this rescaled triangular function converges pointwise to the constant function @xmath84 , for which the fourier transform is a @xmath33 distribution .",
    "coming back to our initial filtering problem and keeping those observations in mind , we define the following filter function : @xmath85/w_i ) { \\rm tri}(\\im[\\beta_i]/w_i )          \\right),\\ ] ] using different filter parameters for each time , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 $ ] denoting the real and imaginary part of @xmath89 , respectively . from our observation",
    "above directly follows that the requirements 1.3 .",
    "[ sec : nc ] ) for a filter are satisfied . in particular and due to its compact support , the filter suppresses any rising behavior of the mtcf .",

    "the multi - time commutation rules of the bosonic operators are unknown for general interaction problems , for details see ch .",
    "2.7 of @xcite . with our filters in eq .",
    ", however , we ensure that the multi - time nonclassicality quasi - probabilities are smooth functions and they can be directly sampled in experiments , which is shown in sec . [",
    "sec : measurement ] .",
    "let us formulate some preliminary conclusions .",
    "the problem of regularizing the @xmath0 functional has been treated .",
    "albeit the singularities of this multi - time quasi - probability are unknown , we formulated a regularization approach via a compact filter function which applies to any nonlinear interaction dynamics of radiation fields .",
    "on this basis , the well - behaved quasi - probability exists and it is negative for a width @xmath15 if and only if the light field under study is nonclassical  including multi - time quantum correlations .",
    "our applied filter suppresses any rising behavior of the mtcf for @xmath94 .",
    "this also includes scenarios where the slope of the mtcf increases faster than an inverse gaussian , which might result from the dynamics of complex interactions .",
    "remarkably , a triangular filter has been already used for the single - mode and -time scenario @xcite . there , the compact support was considered as a deficiency because parts of the characteristic function are multiplied with zero and , thus , do not contribute to the filtered @xmath0 function . here",
    ", however , this compactness serves as a beneficial resource which renders it possible to filter a multi - time @xmath0 functional .",
    "moreover , similar to the multi - mode scenario @xcite , we have a filter in a product form .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we could also and equivalently employ any filter with a compact support , including radial symmetric filters or higher - order autocorrelation - function filters @xcite .",
    "the basic definition of the multi - time nonclassicality is the inability to interpret the singular @xmath0 functional as a joint probability distribution of a classical stochastic process @xcite .",
    "also in the work @xcite , a hierarchy of quantum correlation conditions has been formulated on the basis of measurable space - time - dependent field correlation functions .",
    "an approach to formulate multi - time nonclassicality tests on the basis of the mtcf was subsequently formulated as well @xcite . here , in contrast",
    ", we introduce regular nonclassicality quasi - probabilities that enable us to study quantum correlations between multiple points in time directly via the corresponding negativities of smooth phase - space distributions of quantum stochastic , optical processes .",
    "let us now apply our approach to characterize temporal quantum effects to a specific physical system . in our recent work @xcite , we studied the parametric process based on the mtcf .",
    "such and related parametric interactions are a fundamental tool to generate nonclassical light in modern experimental quantum optics , like , e.g. , squeezed light @xcite .",
    "note that various single - photon sources are based on parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "due to the resulting wide range of applications of this process , let us reconsider this system from the perspective of the technique derived here .",
