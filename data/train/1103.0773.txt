    "within the field of spintronics,@xcite semiconductor devices with spin - orbit coupling have attracted great attention over the past years because they offer a setting where electronic spin polarizations can be generated and manipulated in the absence of ferromagnetism or external magnetic fields.@xcite this opens the perspective of adding the spin degree of freedom to the existing semiconductor logic in information technology without encountering the challenge of artificially integrating local magnetic fields in devices . from this applications point of view",
    "it is clearly desirable to maximize the spin lifetimes and coherence lengths in semiconductor spintronics devices .    in this respect",
    "an ideal candidate is the persistent spin helix ( psh ) , a spin density wave state with infinite lifetime , which exists in two - dimensional electron systems with rashba and linear dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction of equal magnitude  @xcite due to a su(2 ) symmetry of the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite on a less abstract level this can be understood as the combined effect of diffusion and spin precession : the momentum - dependent spin - orbit field is perpendicular to the psh wave vector , and its magnitude grows linearly with the projection of the momentum argument on the direction of this wave vector .",
    "if , for instance , a spin - up electron starts at the crest of @xmath0-spin polarization and travels at the fermi velocity in the direction of the psh wave vector , its spin precesses precisely by an angle of @xmath1 during the time it takes to cover the distance of one psh wavelength .",
    "if the electron propagates off direction , the spin will still match the phase of the psh everywhere because the larger traveling time to , e.g. , the neighboring crest is exactly compensated by a smaller precession frequency .",
    "one promising progress in this direction is the recent realization of the persistent spin helix in a gaas / algaas quantum well by koralek _",
    "et al . _",
    "they used transient spin grating spectroscopy@xcite to optically excite a sinusoidal profile of out - of - plane spin polarization with the `` magic '' psh wave vector . due to the presence of symmetry breaking effects in a real quantum well , instead of a state with infinite lifetime , two decaying modes were observed .",
    "_  named these two modes the symmetry_reduced _ and _ enhanced _ mode  the latter being the psh .",
    "although the lifetime of the observed psh mode is not infinite it is still of the order of @xmath2 , exceeding typical transient spin grating lifetimes by two orders of magnitude .",
    "intriguingly , the temperature dependence of the psh lifetime displays a maximum close to @xmath3 .    in order to improve the lifetimes",
    "it is necessary to figure out what the dominant relaxation mechanisms are .",
    "the temperature dependence of the psh lifetime suggests the involvement of electron - electron interactions ,  @xcite which are known to relax spin currents via the spin coulomb drag effect.@xcite however , since electron - electron interactions respect the su(2 ) symmetry of the psh state , they can not be the sole reason for a finite lifetime but in addition a symmetry breaking term must be present.@xcite here , we consider extrinsic spin orbit interaction  @xcite and cubic dresselhaus spin orbit interaction@xcite as a possible source of symmetry breaking as proposed by koralek _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to develop a theoretical understanding of the psh lifetime and how the lifetime could be enhanced .",
    "in particular we consider the effect of electron - electron interactions in the diffusive dyakonov - perel regime . regarding symmetry breaking mechanisms , our model ( sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) takes into account the effect of extrinsic spin - orbit coupling , which results from the interaction of the conduction electron spins with impurities , as well as the cubic dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction , which is known to be present in the experimental quantum well to a non - negligible amount .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec : spindiffeq ] we derive a diffusion equation for the spin density in our model system and discuss the contribution of the different symmetry breaking mechanisms . in sec .",
    "[ sec : schematic ] we present analytical solutions for the simplified situation where only one symmetry breaking mechanism is present .",
    "we propose that a spatially damped spin profile could enhance the lifetime compared to the psh lifetime . for the parameters of the gaas / algaas quantum well used by koralek",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( sec .",
    "[ sec : numbers ] ) it turns out that electron - electron interactions in combination with cubic dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction are the key ingredients to understand the temperature dependence of the psh lifetime .",
    "detailed conclusions and an outlook are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in an envelope - function description@xcite of the conduction band electrons in semiconductor quantum wells , the spin - orbit interaction takes the form of a momentum - dependent , in - plane effective magnetic field .",
    "the two dominant contributions to this field are linear in the in - plane momentum : the rashba field ,  @xcite which has winding number @xmath4 in momentum space , is caused by structure inversion asymmetry and can be tuned by changing the doping imbalance on both sides of the quantum well .",
    "the linear dresselhaus@xcite contribution , in contrast , has winding number @xmath5 and its physical origin is the bulk inversion asymmetry of the zinc - blende type quantum well material .",
    "it is proportional to the kinetic energy of the electron s out - of - plane motion and therefore decreases quadratically with increasing well width .",
    "in addition , a small cubic dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction is present as well .",
    "thus we write the hamiltonian for conduction band electrons in the ( 001 ) grown quantum well as @xmath6 the first term represents a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with a quadratic dispersion and intrinsic spin - orbit interaction @xmath7 with the @xmath8 matrix in spin space @xmath9 the @xmath10 are creation ( annihilation ) operators for electrons with momentum @xmath11 and spin projection @xmath12 . within the standard envelope function",

    "the strength of the rashba spin - orbit field is controlled by @xmath23 and the coefficient for linear dresselhaus coupling @xmath24 contains a momentum - dependent renormalization due to the presence of cubic dresselhaus coupling , @xmath25 where the `` bare '' linear dresselhaus coefficient @xmath26 is related to the one for cubic dresselhaus @xmath27 via @xmath28 ( @xmath29 being the quantum well width ) .",

    "since we are not interested in charge transport or local charge excitations , we assume that the charge distribution is given by this spatially uniform solution . in the next subsection we use the spin kinetic equation   to derive a drift - diffusion equation for the real space spin density , cf",
    ".  refs .  .",
    "in the following , we consider the dyakonov - perel@xcite regime of strong scattering and/or weak spin - orbit interaction , @xmath58 . during the time interval @xmath59 between two collisions which alter the momentum of an electron  and",
    "thereby @xmath74its spin precesses around the spin - orbit field only by the small angle @xmath60 .",
    "this results in a random walk behavior of the spin.@xcite in contrast to the weak scattering limit @xmath75 , the spin polarization is actually stabilized by scattering in the strong scattering regime @xmath58 : the stronger the scattering , the slower the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation  a phenomenon often referred to as `` motional narrowing '' in analogy to the reduction of linewidths in nmr spectroscopy due to disorder in the local magnetic fields .    in the spirit of the derivation by dyakonov and perel@xcite",
    "we will exploit the separation of the timescales that govern the evolution of isotropic ( in momentum space ) and anisotropic parts of the spin distribution function .",
    "since we deal with a spatially inhomogeneous spin density we also have to assume that the timescale connected to the gradient term in eq .   is large as compared to the transport time , i.e.  @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a typical wave vector of the fourier transformed spin density .",
    "thus when speaking of `` orders in @xmath60 '' in the following , we actually have in mind `` orders in @xmath78 '' .    in order to solve the spin kinetic equation   we split off an isotropic component @xmath79 from the spin density @xmath80 and expand the remaining anisotropic component in winding numbers and powers of momentum @xmath81 , @xmath82 with @xmath83 the anisotropic components of the distribution function arise due to the gradient term in the boltzmann equation and the precession around the spin - orbit field .",
    "since the spin - orbit fields  , contain terms with winding numbers @xmath84 and @xmath85 only these winding numbers have to be considered for the anisotropic part of the spin density to lowest order in @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , one can show that the spin density contains only the same powers of @xmath81 as the corresponding driving terms in hamiltonian  .",
    "thus we consider a @xmath81- and a @xmath87-term in the ansatz for the winding number @xmath88-terms of the spin density   and , because the winding number @xmath84-terms of the kinetic equation   are the gradient term , the linear rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit fields as well as the renormalization of the linear dresselhaus term due to cubic dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the winding number @xmath85-component of the spin density  , on the other hand , contains only a @xmath87-term because only the cubic dresselhaus spin - orbit field contributes to winding number @xmath85 in the kinetic equation  .    in the following we consider point - like impurities , i.e. , isotropic scattering with @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore we assume low temperature @xmath90 and perform a sommerfeld expansion up to order @xmath91 in all momentum integrations .",
    "in this procedure we encounter integrals of the form ( @xmath92 ) @xmath93 with @xmath94 and the sommerfeld functions ( see appendix  [ app : sommerfeld ] ) @xmath95    with the goal of obtaining diffusion equations for the real space spin density we start by momentum integration of the kinetic equation , @xmath96 $ ] , using the ansatz .",
    "this yields the _ isotropic _ equation for the isotropic component of the spin density    @xmath97\\right\\}\\label{szextr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath98 where @xmath99 represents the ratio of cubic and linear dresselhaus coupling strengths and @xmath100    eqs.- can be seen as continuity equations for the spin density where the anisotropic components @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 play the role of ( generalized ) spin currents .",
    "the impurity collision integral   contains a spin - dependent part due to extrinsic spin - orbit interaction , which acts as a drain for in - plane spin - polarization with the elliot - yafet relaxation rate@xcite @xmath104 this relaxation mechanism can be understood as the net effect of the electron spins precessing by a small angle around the extrinsic spin - orbit field _ during _",
    "the collision with an impurity .",
    "since this field is perpendicular to the electronic motion , i.e. , it points in @xmath0-direction , the @xmath0 component of the isotropic spin density is unaffected by the elliot - yafet mechanism .",
    "the anisotropic components @xmath101 , @xmath103 and @xmath105 can in turn be expressed in terms of the isotropic spin density @xmath106 by integrating the kinetic equation   times velocity , where , this time , we omit the time derivative .",
    "the justification for doing so is that , in order to capture the slow precession - diffusion dynamics of the real space density , we can interpret the time derivative as a coarse - grained one , i.e.  @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "then the fast relaxation of the anisotropic components into the steady state at the beginning of each time interval @xmath109 contributes only in higher order in @xmath60 to the average over @xmath109 .",
    "thus , to leading order , it is sufficient to find the ( quasi-)equilibrium solutions for the anisotropic coefficients .",
    "another way of seeing this is in analogy with the born - oppenheimer approximation : similarly to the fast moving electrons in a molecule , which almost instantaneously find their equilibrium positions with respect to the slowly vibrating nuclei , the anisotropic parts of the spin distribution quickly adjust to the momentary isotropic spin density .",
    "the backaction of the anisotropic parts on the isotropic spin density is then well described using their steady state solution .    by integrating @xmath110",
