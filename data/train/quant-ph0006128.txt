    "a problem which has received considerable attention in the last few years is to find necessary and sufficient conditions under which a quantum state of a composite system is separable .",
    "the example extraordinaire of a non - separable state is a pair of 2-level particles in a singlet state , a so - called epr - pair , named after einstein , podolsky and rosen , who used this sort of state to show that quantum mechanics exhibits strong non - local correlations which seem to violate the relativity principle .",
    "a separable state of a composite system can be written as the direct product of the subsystem states : @xmath2 . a non - separable state , or _ entangled _ state can not be decomposed in this way ; e.g. , the singlet state @xmath3 consists of a superposition of separable states but is itself not separable .",
    "nowadays , the importance of entangled states goes beyond a mere fundamental interest , since epr - pairs are the basic resources of quantum techniques such as quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation and quantum error correction .",
    "a mixed state is separable iff its density matrix can be written as a convex linear combination of pure product states ; for a bipartite system this reads : @xmath4 the separability problem consists of finding a criterion for checking whether such a decomposition is possible for a given state .    despite the simple formulation of this problem , a complete solution has to this date not been found .",
    "an important achievement was the discovery by peres of a necessary condition for separability @xcite .",
    "he noted that the _ partial transposition _ of a separable state still has non - negative eigenvalues , just as the original state .",
    "thus , if the partial transposition of state @xmath5 is not a state ( i.e.  does not have non - negative eigenvalues summing to one),then @xmath5 is not separable ( i.e.  is an entangled state ) .",
    "the importance of this criterion was soon realised when m. , p.  and r.  horodecki proved @xcite that it is also a sufficient criterion for @xmath1 and @xmath6 systems . for an introduction to recent results on this subject ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "if a state is entangled , one could ask for a measure of the amount of entanglement . for pure states ,",
    "a measure generally agreed upon is the von neumann subsystem entropy : the entropy of the partial trace of the state projector . for mixed states ,",
    "the situation is much more difficult .",
    "not only is there no single measure of entanglement which is suited for every purpose , but calculating the values of the different proposed measures and proving statements about them is exceedingly difficult . among the proposed measures are the entanglement of formation @xcite , the entanglement of distillation @xcite and relative entropy of entanglement @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on separability , on entanglement of formation ( eof ) and on the related concept of concurrence .",
    "all these subjects are related , because states are separable if and only if their eof is zero .",
    "a closed form expression exists for the eof of @xmath1 systems in terms of their concurrence @xcite .",
    "a closed form expression also exists for isotropic states of general systems @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give variational characterisations of separability and eof for general ( i.e.  any dimensions ) bipartite states .",
    "such a characterisation is of the form @xmath7 , that is : the state property under study can be found as the minimal value of some specific function over the manifold of unitary matrices @xmath8 . in section",
    "ii it will be shown how this can be done .",
    "the language of section ii is matrix analysis , not only because this allows to state the results in a most succinct way but also because it gives clues towards generalisations .",
    "the greatest benefit of a variational characterisation is that it directly yields a method for actually calculating the state property @xmath9 , albeit in a numerical fashion , using a minimisation procedure . in section iii",
    "we describe the procedure which we have used , and some interesting results we have obtained with it .",
    "it is well known that mixed states can be realised by an ensemble of pure states in an infinite number of ways .",
    "the determination of the separability of a state and the determination of its entanglement of formation have in common that a particular realisation of a state has to be found such that some property holds for all pure states in that realisation . in order to find this optimal realisation ,",
    "it is of considerable interest to have a mathematically elegant way of `` generating '' all possible realisations of a state . in section [ ss21 ]",
    "we will recollect a result by hughston , jozsa and wootters that any realisation of a state is related to the eigenvalue decomposition of the state via some right - unitary matrix .",
    "the required property for separability is that all pure states in the realisation must be product states . in section [ ss22 ]",
    "we give a number of useful mathematical expressions for this property .",
    "this then leads to a variational characterisation of separability , the topic of section [ ss23 ] . for calculating the eof of the state",
    ", the property of the optimal realisation is that the so - called average entanglement of the realisation is minimal .",
    "this property and an ensuing variational characterisation of eof will be discussed in section [ ss24 ] .    in this way ,",
    "searching all possible realisations for some property amounts to passing through all right - unitary matrices and test the property in question .",
    "however , this would be a very impractical way to determine separability or eof if there would not be some bound on the dimension of these matrices , or , which is the same thing , on the number of pure states in the optimal realisation .",
    "luckily , such a bound exists . in the case of separability ,",
    "horodecki proved @xcite that @xmath10 pure states ( or less ) suffice , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the dimensions of the subsystem hilbert spaces .",
    "uhlmann @xcite proved that a similar bound holds for the determination of eof : the number of pure states in the optimal realisation need not be larger than the square of the rank of the state .    in section [ ss26 ]",
    "we discuss the so - called concurrence of a state , a quantity which is closely related to the eof .",
    "we give an alternative proof of an important result on the concurrence of @xmath1 states by wootters @xcite .",
    "one of the virtues of this alternative proof is that it yields an additional result on the exact amount of pure states in the optimal realisation .",
    "we then report some progress in generalising the concurrence concept to higher - dimensional bipartite states .    in appendix a ,",
    "finally , a method is described for reducing the set of unitary matrices which has to be examined , in the case of separability testing . under some circumstances ,",
    "this method directly yields an optimal realisation , without any need for searching .",
    "we have not yet investigated whether this method is applicable to the eof case .",
    "consider a rank-@xmath13 state @xmath5 in an @xmath14-dimensional hilbert space , realised by an ensemble @xmath15 , where the @xmath16 are the mixing weights of the @xmath17 pure state vectors @xmath18 .",
    "the number @xmath17 is called the _ cardinality _ of the ensemble .",
    "necessarily , @xmath17 can not be smaller than the rank @xmath13 . since there generally are an infinite number of ensembles realising a particular mixed state , we are free to choose @xmath17 larger than @xmath13 if this suits our purposes .",
    "it will turn out that sometimes we will even be forced to take @xmath19 .    thus : @xmath20 , or @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a @xmath23 diagonal matrix with @xmath24 , and the columns of @xmath25 are the @xmath17 vectors @xmath26 .",
    "this decomposition of @xmath5 is reminiscent of the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath5 : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an @xmath29 diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of @xmath5 , and the columns of @xmath30 are the @xmath13 eigenvectors .",
    "since @xmath5 is hermitian , @xmath30 is a unitary matrix",
    ".    it can now easily be proven that these two decompositions must be related by an @xmath31 right - unitary matrix @xmath8 ; this has been done first by hughston , jozsa and wootters @xcite .    for a general state @xmath5 , with eigenvalue decomposition @xmath27",

    ", the proof becomes very simple :    _ proof .",
    "_ first of all , it is obvious that @xmath35 follows directly from ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",

    "since both @xmath28 and @xmath41 are positive semidefinite , it follows that @xmath43 so that @xmath44 .",
    "this is precisely equation([eq:1 ] ) , with @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46    _ remark .",
    "_ it is noteworthy that the elements of @xmath22 and @xmath28 are related to each other independently of @xmath30 and @xmath25 : @xmath47 this follows from the observations that @xmath30 is unitary and that the columns of @xmath25 have norm one .",
    "a state of an @xmath14 system is separable iff there exists a realising ensemble consisting solely of product vectors @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( in this paper we use superscripts for enumerating vectors , and subscripts for denoting vector components ) .",
    "product vectors can be characterised easily by rearranging their components in matrix form . for an @xmath51-vector @xmath52 ,",
    "let @xmath53 be an @xmath14 matrix such that @xmath54 for product vectors this gives : @xmath55 obviously , product vectors are characterised by the condition that the rank of @xmath56 is 1 .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for this is that all @xmath57 minors of @xmath56 must be zero , or , more succinctly , that the _ second compound matrix _ of @xmath56 must be zero : @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the second compound matrix of an @xmath14 matrix is an @xmath59 matrix with elements : @xmath60 the elements of @xmath61 are all possible @xmath57 minors of @xmath62 .",
    "the second compound matrix has a lot of useful properties , such as : @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite .    for practical applications",
    "it is sometimes better to consider a @xmath66 submatrix of @xmath61 , the one containing the elements @xmath67 only .",
    "it is easily seen that the vanishing of this submatrix is already sufficient for @xmath62 being of rank 1 .    from the expression for the second compound matrix , which is quadratic in @xmath62",
    ", it will prove useful to construct a bilinear function of two @xmath14 matrices , denoted @xmath68 : @xmath69 obviously , @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 if and only if @xmath62 has rank 1 .",
    "more specifically , we can apply this to the state vectors @xmath26 : @xmath26 is a product vector iff @xmath72 .    in the following",
    ", we will only use a symmetrised version of @xmath73 , which we will denote by @xmath74 since this is a bilinear function in the elements of @xmath25 , we can express this in matrix notation : @xmath75 where the notation @xmath76 is a shorthand for the index tuple @xmath77 .",
    "the matrices @xmath78 , which we call _ indicator matrices _ , are defined as @xmath79 all other elements being zero .",
    "note that all @xmath80 have rank equal to 4 . for the case of @xmath1-systems",
    ", there is only one indicator matrix ; it is equal to @xmath81 , corresponding to a spin - flip operator @xcite .",
    "we can now formulate a general necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of a mixed state . as mentioned before , the state @xmath27 is separable iff there exists a decomposition @xmath21 , with @xmath82 , such that all @xmath26 are product states , or @xmath83 , for all @xmath84 .    now : @xmath85 where we have used bilinearity of the form @xmath86 .",
    "given the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath5 , the entity @xmath87 can be calculated straightforwardly .",

    "testing separability requires that the system ( [ eq : sep ] ) be solved for @xmath8 .",
    "another approach , however , is to consider @xmath98 as entries of a matrix indexed by @xmath94 and @xmath93 and to try to minimise a matrix norm of this matrix .",
    "the state is then separable iff this minimum is zero .",
    "one can use whatever matrix norm one prefers , e.g.  the hilbert - schmidt norm ( also called frobenius norm or @xmath99-norm ) @xmath100 .",

    "one can also use the @xmath103 norm ( sum of absolute values ) and minimise @xmath104 . for @xmath57 systems",
    "the @xmath103 norm is the _ average concurrence _ of the ensemble , as introduced by wootters in @xcite , and the minimum is the _ concurrence _ of the state @xmath5 .",
    "note that in the context of separability testing it does not matter whether one uses @xmath98 or @xmath105 .",

    "the von neumann entropy @xmath112 of a state @xmath5 is @xmath113 ; introducing the function @xmath114 , we can express @xmath112 as a function of the eigenvalues @xmath115 of @xmath5 : @xmath116 .",
    "the entanglement of a pure state @xmath117 of a bipartite system @xmath118 is the entropy of the partial trace of the projector of @xmath119 : @xmath120 , with @xmath121 .",

    "the first analytic formula for calculating eof has been found by wootters @xcite and is valid for @xmath1 systems .",
    "a basic property used in deriving the formula is the so - called concurrence of a state .",
    "the concurrence is also useful for testing separability , because a @xmath1 state is separable iff its concurrence equals zero . in this section",
    "we do two things : first we rederive wootters results in a shorter way , based on the concepts we have introduced above and using an interesting theorem from matrix analysis .",

    "we give a shorter proof of wootters results on the eof of @xmath57 systems @xcite .",
    "for the case of @xmath1 systems , formula ( [ eq : sep ] ) becomes particularly simple , since there is only one @xmath57 minor to consider , so that there is just a single symmetric matrix @xmath88 .",

    ", we select a number of starting points at random and let the minimisation algorithm work from these points . the minimum is then taken over all the results . while this procedure does not guarantee that the global minimum is actually found , we found that trying about ten starting points gives satisfactory results .      in this paragraph",
    "we give an analytic expression for the gradient of the target function @xmath229 .",
    "conjugate gradient methods perform better if an explicit expression is given ; in the absence of such an expression , the gradient has to be approximated numerically .",
    "to calculate the gradient , we have to select an arbitrary direction or tangent vector @xmath37 , which for the unitary manifold is a skew - hermitian matrix .",
    "the geodesic on the unitary manifold along this direction and passing through @xmath230 is given by @xmath231 , or @xmath232 , for small @xmath233 .",
    "the gradient of a scalar function on the manifold can be calculated from the variation of the function along the geodesic , using @xmath234 where @xmath223 is the hilbert - schmidt inner product .",
    "the gradient of the target function @xmath229 is :    @xmath235 where @xmath236 and @xmath237    the details of the calculation are given in appendix b.      as a preliminary test , we have calculated the entanglement of formation of several states of a @xmath1 system , and compared the numerical values with the ones obtainable from wootters formula .",
    "furthermore , we considered a one - parameter family of @xmath0 states called isotropic states , and compared the numerical values with the eof calculated from terhal and vollbrecht s formula @xcite . in all cases , agreement was complete within numerical machine precision , except for some isotropic states where there was a very small deviation from the formula for parameter values close to @xmath238 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that , for these parameter values , there are two local minima of the target function which are very close in value , and that the minimum with lowest value has a very small `` basin of attraction '' .    the first interesting results were obtained on the horodecki @xmath0 states @xcite .",
    "these states were introduced to show that the peres criterion is not sufficient for determining separability .",
    "these states exhibit _ bound entanglement _ :",

    "note that , since these states are not full - rank ( their rank is 7 ) , and neither is their partial transpose , these states lie on the boundary of the set of states and also on the boundary of the set of bound entangled states .",
    "the result of the calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fighoro1 ] . here",
    "the entanglement of formation has been calculated of a mixture of the horodecki states with the maximally mixed state : @xmath243 . in fig .",
    "[ fighoro1 ] , the scale is linear , while in fig .",
    "[ fighoro2 ] the scale is logarithmic , so that the borderline of the set of separable states is clearly visible .",
    "the `` floor '' in the logarithmic picture at -10 is an artifact ; the algorithm stops when the entanglement gets below @xmath244 .",
    "note from these results that the horodecki states have a rather low entanglement of formation ( about 0.0109 for @xmath245 ) and that their distance to the manifold of separable states is also small ( @xmath246 for @xmath245 ; that is : mixing the state with just 7% of the identity destroys all entanglement ) . at first sight ,",
    "the fact that the appearance of the set of separable states is not convex might seem confusing . however , the parameter @xmath240 appears in a non - linear way in the density matrix so that the matrices lie on a non - rectilinear curve in the euclidean state space .",
    "the figure , on the other hand , has @xmath240 as parameter and therefore gives a distorted image .",
    "[ fighoro3 ] shows the entanglement of formation for the particular value of @xmath245 and for @xmath247 going to 1 . from this figure ,",
    "we are led to conjecture that the derivative to @xmath247 becomes infinite at @xmath248 .",
    "the abovementioned calculations have been performed with the cardinality @xmath17 set to 14 .",
    "[ figcard ] shows the effect of using different @xmath17 in the calculations ; here @xmath248 and @xmath245 .",
    "it is seen that the value @xmath249 is optimal for calculating the entanglement of formation in this case .    for these same horodecki states",
    ", we have also tested the conjectured condition for separability ( equation ( [ eq : allconc ] ) ) , based on the generalised concurrence .",
    "it turned out , quite surprisingly , that the condition correctly pinpointed all separable states , which was verified by comparing the results to fig .",
    "[ fighoro2 ] .",
    "this leads us to hope that equation ( [ eq : allconc ] ) might be an important step towards finding a simple and efficient operational criterion for testing separability .",
    "we have presented a matrix analytical framework within which the questions of separability of mixed states and calculating their entanglement of formation can be formulated in an elegant and practical way .",
    "a main result is that , at least in principle , it is now be possible to calculate the eof of any state , or determining whether it is a separable state or not .",
    "of course , for larger dimensions the subproblem of minimising the respective target function becomes increasingly more time consuming .",
    "not only the eof itself , but also an optimal ensemble realising the state can be calculated .",
    "we have extended results on the concurrence and eof of @xmath1 systems by also including the cardinality of the optimal ensembles .",
    "more importantly , we have tried to generalise the concept of concurrence to general systems , and have shown that this generalised concurrence has potential to supply a fast test for separability of general bipartite states .    in the future",
    ", we will use the presented methods to generate more numerical results about eof of higher - dimensional states , for example , to chart the `` unknown territory '' of bound - entangled states , or just as a means for testing various conjectures .",
    "furthermore , the variational characterisation of eof could be useful in proving or disproving that eof is additive .",
    "another interesting topic for future work is trying to prove the conjectured sufficiency of the generalised concurrence test for separability .",

    "if @xmath8 is square ( that is , @xmath260 ) , @xmath8 is unitary , and since @xmath261 , @xmath262 hence , the column vectors of @xmath8 must be the eigenvectors of @xmath263 .",
    "given then all the symmetric matrices @xmath254 that satisfy equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) , we only have to consider @xmath8 matrices whose column vectors are the eigenvectors of one such @xmath254",
    ".    we will now show that under some conditions the reduced search space contains nothing but the optimal @xmath8 , so that no search has to be done at all . in that case ,",
    "one just has to take one @xmath254 satisfying equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) , and construct a @xmath8 from its eigenvectors .",
    "the first requirement for this is that the cardinality @xmath17 must equal the rank @xmath13 , so that @xmath8 is then unitary ; the reason is that otherwise ( [ eq : bt ] ) has no unique solution .",
    "let us suppose that the first @xmath264 ( @xmath265 ) statevectors in the ensemble realising @xmath5 are product vectors : @xmath266 .",
    "therefore , @xmath267 will be zero for @xmath268 .",
    "now , the matrices @xmath256 for @xmath269 and @xmath270 are in general ( that is : for all states except for a subset of measure zero ) linearly independent , as long as the number of matrices does not exceed the number of matrix elements .",
    "if the latter requirement is not fulfilled , then of course a dependence must exist between the matrices .",
    "if the requirement is fulfilled then the matrices can still be dependent provided the @xmath17 vectors @xmath26 ( being @xmath271 complex variables ) satisfy a system of @xmath272 polynomial equations of degree @xmath273 ( each equation corresponds to a minor of rank @xmath274 of a matrix containing @xmath275 as elements ) . using the schwarz - zippel theorem @xcite",
    ", we find that the set of vectors obeying just one of those polynomial equations has measure zero with respect to the set of all possible sets of @xmath17 vectors .",
    "a fortiori , this also holds for the set of vectors obeying all polynomial equations .",
    "we thus get a second requirement for the automatic optimality of @xmath8 , namely that the cardinality @xmath17 must satisfy the inequality @xmath276 it then follows that @xmath277 can only be zero if @xmath278 for all @xmath279 and @xmath270 . in other words : @xmath255 is necessarily a diagonal matrix for _ any _ @xmath254 satisfying ( [ eq:3 ] ) , and any @xmath8 obeying ( [ eq : bt ] ) is optimal .",
    "we have not investigated whether this technique for reducing the search space is also applicable for calculating the eof ; that is , whether some @xmath8 that is optimal w.r.t .",
