    "astrophysical neutrinos are also tracers of hadronic interactions , and the identification of these neutrino sources may help to clarify cosmic ray acceleration processes @xcite .",
    "candidate sources for cosmic ray acceleration ( and therefore neutrino emission ) include supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks @xcite , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) jets @xcite , starburst galaxies @xcite , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",

    "one challenge is that only @xmath10 of the events in that sample are associated with a high - energy muon which leaves a visible track in the detector .",
    "the remaining events without a track have a poor angular resolution of @xmath11 .",
    "this paper presents the latest results of searches for point sources of astrophysical neutrinos with a sample of track - like events associated with @xmath12 ( and some @xmath13 ) charged current interactions observed by the icecube neutrino observatory .",
    "these events have an excellent angular resolution of @xmath14 and hence allow us to point back towards the source .",
    "as the main signature we focus on is the resultant muon , the interaction vertex is not required to lie inside the detector as in ref .",
    "@xcite and the effective volume is hence effectively enhanced .",
