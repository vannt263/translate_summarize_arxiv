    "the pairing symmetry of the hole - doped high-@xmath4 superconductors is generally believed to have the dominant @xmath3-wave pairing . however , the pairing symmetry of the electron - doped high-@xmath4 superconductors is still under debate .",
    "@xcite while no consensus has been reached yet , more and more recent experimental results have suggested that the order parameter of electron - doped cuprates is likely to have a dominant @xmath3-wave pairing symmetry ,  @xcite and with an unusual non - monotonic gap function .",
    "although various explanations have been proposed to account for the non - monotonic behavior , they can generally be categorized into two scenarios .",
    "@xcite one is to extend the superconducting ( sc ) gap out of the simple @xmath3-wave via the inclusion of higher harmonics term .",
    "@xcite from theoretical perspective , the non - monotonic @xmath3-wave gap appears under the assumption that the @xmath3-wave pairing is caused by the interaction with the continuum of overdamped antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin fluctuations . in this scenario ,",
    "the non - monotonic gap behavior is described by the combination effect of a @xmath3-wave paring plus a higher harmonics term ( dp+hh ) .",
    "therefore , it is an intrinsic property of the sc state regardless of the presence of the af order , and a simple one - band model is used to reproduce the non - monotonic gap behavior .",
    "the other argues that the non - monotonic behavior is the outcome of the coexistence of the af and the sc orders .",
    "@xcite this scenario assumes that the af order disguises the @xmath3-wave character of sc gap .",
    "when the af order is introduced , the resulting quasiparticle ( qp ) excitation can be gapped by both orders and behaves to be non - monotonic , although the sc gap itself is monotonic .",
    "the scenario gained support from the angle - resolved photoemission spectra ( arpes ) measurements , where two inequivalent fermi pockets around @xmath5 and @xmath6 have been detected .",
    "@xcite this phenomena is well explained in terms of the @xmath7-dependent band - folding effect associated with an af order which splits the band into upper and lower branches ,  @xcite leading to the two - band and/or two - gap model .",
    "recently , neutron scattering experiments in electron - doped cuprates have revealed that the spin response is commensurate in a substantial frequency range below a crossover frequency @xmath2 , @xcite which constitutes a distinct difference from the widely studied hour - glass dispersion in the hole - doped cuprates.@xcite although , both scenarios mentioned above can account for the non - monotonic gap behavior of the electron - doped cuprates , a comparative study on the spin dynamics between the two scenarios is deserved to demonstrate the possible differences and therefore serve to select the reasonable model for electron - doped high-@xmath4 cuprates .    in this paper , we investigate the spin dynamics in the coexisting phase of the af and the @xmath3-wave sc orders .",
    "the calculation is based on a self - consistent determination of the qp dispersion , the af order and the sc gap at the slave - boson mean - field level of the @xmath0 model .",
    "it is shown that the af and sc orders compete and coexist in a substantial doping range in the underdoped regime .",
    "the spin response is commensurate below a crossover frequency @xmath2 for all dopings considered , and it becomes incommensurate when the frequency is higher than @xmath2 .",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with experiments .",
    "@xcite while in the framework of the pure sc state with @xmath3-wave and/or dp+hh ,  @xcite , though an extended region of a commensurate spin fluctuation also exists , it evolves into an incommensurate spin fluctuation at low frequencies , which is not consistent experiments .",
    "therefore , our result suggests that the inclusion of the two - band effect resulting from the coexisting af and sc orders is important to consistently account for both the spin dynamics and the non - monotonic gap behavior in the electron - doped cuprates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the theoretical model and carry out the analytical calculations . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the numerical results with some discussions . finally , we present the conclusion in sec .",

    "this hamiltonian can be used to model both hole - doped and electron - doped systems after a particle - hole transformation . for electron doping",
    ", one has @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 , @xmath18@xmath19@xmath17 and @xmath20@xmath16@xmath17 . the slave - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft )",
    "is used to decouple the electron operators @xmath21 to bosons @xmath22 carrying the charge and fermions @xmath23 representing the spin .",
    "then , the local constraint @xmath24=@xmath25 is satisfied averagely at the mean - field ( mf ) level .",
    "we choose the spinon pairing order @xmath26=@xmath27=@xmath28 , where @xmath29 for bond @xmath9 along @xmath30 direction , the uniform bond order @xmath31=@xmath32=@xmath33 , the af order @xmath34 , and replace @xmath22 by @xmath35=@xmath36 due to boson condensation .",
    "after the fourier transformation , the mean - field ( mf ) hamiltonian can be written in the nambu representation , @xmath37 here , the nambu operator @xmath38 , and @xmath39 where , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "@xmath81 is taken as 1 .",
    "as for the pure sc state with dp+hh , we choose a slightly small @xmath82 , the criteria for choosing @xmath81 is to set the af instability at @xmath83 .",
    "the parameter @xmath84=@xmath85 is introduced to account for the qp damping rate which comes from the scattering off other fluctuations that are not included here .",
    "in fig . 1 , we show the mf parameters @xmath33 , @xmath56 and @xmath55 as a function of doping @xmath57 . for a comparison",
    ", we also show the doping dependence of the mf sc gap @xmath86 obtained without considering the af order by setting @xmath87 .",
    "it is seen that the staggered magnetization @xmath56 decreases with increasing doping @xmath57 , and goes sharply to zero at @xmath88 , which implies a phase transition from the antiferromagnetism ( afm ) phase to the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the sc order parameter , on the other hand , increases its value initially up to an optimal doping level , and then decreases upon further doping , forming a generic sc dome .",
    "@xcite however , the sc order parameter @xmath86 without the inclusion of the af order exhibits a monotonic decrease with doping , which deviates obviously from the experimental observations .",
    "furthermore , the sc order parameter @xmath55 with an af order shows a noticeable suppression compared to @xmath86 , exhibits a competitive character with the af order .",
    "but , they also coexist in a substantial doping range .",
    "the mf phase diagram also shows that the optimal doping is rather low compared to that deduced from the experiments",
    ". this may be due to the fact the sbmft includes only the mf value of the order parameters and treats the no - double occupancy on the average .",
    "however , the similarity of the phase diagram obtained by the sbmft to that of the variational quantum - cluster theory  @xcite validates the sbmft as a low energy effective theory . here",
    "our aim is to use the mf theory as an effective model to study the effect of the af order on the spin dynamics , and then to compare the two - band and/or two - gap model with the simple one - band model .",
    "therefore , the relatively simple sbmft is qualitatively enough for our purpose .",
    "we note that a similar phase diagram has been obtained before .",

    ", it is found that the low - energy excitations exhibit commensurate peaks for all @xmath57 , which consists with the experiments well  @xcite .",
    "the inset shows the spin susceptibility im@xmath89 at doping @xmath91 in the pure sc state with dp+hh which is used to reproduce a non - monotonic sc gap behavior .",
    "one can see that the spin response is incommensurate at low frequency without considering the af order .",
    "detailed frequency dependence of the spin response in the coexisting phase and the pure sc phase with dp+hh at doping @xmath91 are shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , and figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) , respectively .",
    "the difference in the low frequency regime of the two phases is more evident here .",
    "the spin fluctuation is commensurate in a substantial frequency range below a crossover frequency @xmath92 and down to the lowest frequency considered in the coexisting phase , and it switches to be incommensurate when the frequency is higher than @xmath92 [ figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) ] .",
    "this feature agrees with the neutron - scattering measurements on electron - doped cuprates that have been reported recently .",
    "@xcite while for the pure sc phase with dp+hh , the spin response is incommensurate at low frequency , then it switches to be commensurate within the intermediate frequency range , and becomes incommensurate again at higher frequency .",
    "@xcite these results can be summarized in the intensity plot of the imaginary part of the renormalized spin susceptibility im@xmath89 as a function of frequency and momentum along @xmath93 direction , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . in the figure , the solid line indicating the peak position is the dispersion of spin excitations .",
    "the commensurate spin fluctuation prevails below @xmath2 for the coexisting system [ fig .",
    "4(a ) ] . for the pure sc phase with dp+hh",
    ", the dispersion shows a hourglass - like behavior [ fig .",
    "4(c ) ] , which is similar to the hole - doped one , and does not consistent with the experiments on electron - doped cuprates .",
    "@xcite    in the presence of the af order , the energy band of quasiparticles is split into two bands .",
    "therefore , the particle - hole excitations that contributed to the spin susceptibility are composed of two kinds of excitations , the intra - band and the inter - band excitations . in fig . 5",
    ", we present the results for the bare spin susceptibility @xmath94 ( without the rpa correction ) coming from the intra - band and the inter - band contributions , respectively .",
    "5(a1 ) and 5(a2 ) denote the imaginary part of @xmath94 , figs .",
    "5(b1 ) and 5(b2 ) the real part .",
    "one obvious feature is that , the intra - band contribution is zero at the af momentum @xmath44 , leading to the incommensurate spin response .",
    "it results from the fact that the coherence factor in the spin susceptibility due to the intra - band excitations , @xmath95/[{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k+q}}^{2}+(2jm)^{2 } } \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{2}+(2jm)^{2}}}]$ ] [ where , @xmath96 is zero at @xmath97 . while , the inter - band contribution is commensurate for all frequencies . at low frequencies ,",
    "the inter - band excitations have a larger contribution to the spin susceptibility than the intra - band excitations , so the spin fluctuation is commensurate .",
    "however , with the increase of frequency , the intensity of im@xmath94 due to the intra - band contributions increases more rapidly than the inter - band contribution .",
    "as a result , the spin fluctuation switches from a commensurate to an incommensurate structure .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the spin dynamics in the electron - doped cuprates in the coexisting phase of the @xmath3-wave sc and af orders , and compared the results with that in the dominant @xmath3-wave phase with a higher harmonics term . in the coexisting phase",
    ", we found that the spin response is commensurate in a substantial frequency range below a crossover frequency @xmath2 for all dopings considered , and it switches to be incommensurate when the frequency is higher than @xmath2 .",
    "the theoretical calculations are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental measurements . however , in the dominant @xmath3-wave phase with a higher harmonics term , the dispersion is just like that of the hole - doped one , namely exhibits a hourglass - like dispersion , which is not consistent with experiments .",
