    "the first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an rca group based in harrison , nj .",
    "harley iams and bernard salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric - effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain @xcite .",
    "currently pmts are largely used in many experiments .",
    "focusing on the astroparticle physics area , there are three classes of experiments that are very challenging both from their physics goals and the adopted detector technology : neutrino telescopes , cherenkov telescopes arrays , dark matter searches .",
    "+ neutrino telescopes are aiming at the detection of very high - energy neutrinos produced by galactic and/or extra - galactic sources .",
    "the detector consists of tens of thousands of photodetectors that are used to instrument cubic kilometers of ice / water located at elevated depth .",
    "the photomultipliers used in the ongoing experiments ( antares , km3net , icecube ) , although performing very well , have the following drawbacks @xcite :    * the power consumption is not negligible , imposing strong requirements on the mechanical structure that hosts them ; * the resolution of photoelectrons is poor ; * the transit time spread ( tts ) is not better than @xmath0 .    for these experiments , the tts is a critical parameter since it strongly affects the track reconstruction . on the other side requiring pmts with a small tts increases the costs .",
    "+ cherenkov telescopes array use pmts to detect light focused in the focal planes of the telescopes .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the most critical characteristics of the pmts in this field are : pulse shape , gain , temperature dependence , quantum efficiency , noise and aging .",
    "another aspect it is worth to mention is that in order to cover the large area camera , the number of channels is huge . as an example , in the medium size telescope of the cta experiment the camera will consist of about 11000 pixels , each with physical size about @xmath1 , with a high dark count rate .",
    "+ to reduce the dark noise down to few mhz , it has been proposed to operate the photomultipliers at moderately low temperatures , around 10 @xmath2c .",
    "+ pmts play a crucial role also in direct dark matter search experiments with noble liquids @xcite . in these applications",
    "pmts are used to convert into an electrical signal the low quantity of light emitted in the interaction of dark matter with the detector target .",
    "the requirements are the following :    * ability to work at cryogenic temperature ; * single photoelectron detection capability ; * high single photoelectron resolution ; * radioactivity well below @xmath3 .",
    "this is a major challenge found in most dark matter detection experiments .    to overcome these limits",
    ", we invented a new high - gain , silicon - based photodetector , the vacuum silicon photomultiplier tube @xcite .",
    "the innovative idea is to replace the traditional dynode chain of a pmt with a sipm ( fig .",
    "[ vsipmtdesign ] ) , the latter acting as an electron detector and then as a current amplifier with a gain of @xmath4 , that is similar to the one of standard pmts .",
    "the realization of the vsipmt with a photocathode of at least 1 inch diameter will have a tremendous impact on astroparticle physics experiments by starting a new generation of photodetectors which exhibit several attractive features such as : excellent photon counting , high gain ( @xmath4 ) , negligible power consumption(@xmath5 ) , small tts ( @xmath6 ) , simplicity , compactness and robustness .",
    "+ in this paper we discuss how the vsipmt deals with the highly demanding requirements of the astro - particle experiments discussed above .",
    "the r&d to demonstrate the vsipmt feasibility started with a full geant-4 simulation and then by testing the response of a special non - windowed mppc by hamamatsu to an electron beam .",
    "the mppc showed quite well separated peaks and , consequently , electron counting capabilities providing the first proof of feasibility of the device @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "these results encouraged hamamatsu to develop two vsipmt prototypes ( eb - mppc050 ( zj5025 ) and eb - mppc100 ( zj4991 ) ) , whose characteristics have been carefully studied in the infn - napoli laboratories .",
    "+ one of the two prototypes is shown in fig .",
    "[ prototipo ] .",
    "the absence of the divider has several very important consequences :    1 .",
    "the device is compact ; 2 .",
    "there are only three connections : two cables to supply power to the photocathode and to the mppc ( the thin cable on the right and the lemo cable on the left , respectively ) and one sma output for signal readout .",
    "the prototypes have the same envelope with a @xmath7 borosilicate glass entrance window and a gaasp photocathode with a @xmath8 diameter and a spectral response in the range between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ schema_prototipo ] ) .",
    "+ the two devices differ only in the characteristics of the mppcs used , see table [ differenze ] , in this paper we will relate to zj5025 results .",
    ".table of the vsipmt characteristics . [ cols=\">,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the dynamic range of a vsipmt depends on the total number of cells of the sipm and on the capability of focusing uniformly photoelectrons over the sipm surface .",
    "+ given the total number of available cells ( @xmath11 ) of the sipm , the number of fired cells ( @xmath12 ) as a function of the number of incident photons ( @xmath13 ) and of the pde is given by : @xmath14.\\ ] ] the exponential trend of the sipm dynamic range sets a strict constraint on the performance of the vsipmt .",
    "indeed , the eq .",
    "[ dyn_vsipmt ] represents the ideal maximum dynamics for the prototype under test , with @xmath15 .",
    "+ another major contribution to the dynamic range of the vsipmt is provided by the focusing .",
    "the gaasp photocathode of the vsipmt prototype has a circular shape .",
    "therefore , taking into account the axial symmetry of the electric field generated by the focusing ring , an approximately circular photoelectron spot is reasonably expected .",
    "this means that an optimal focusing condition is achieved if the photoelectron beam spot is perfectly inscribed in the sipm square target . in this case , no more than the @xmath16 of the total number of cells of the sipm can be fired , therefore the optimized dynamic range for the prototype is that plotted in fig .",
    "[ dyn_50um ] ( green curve ) , corresponding to @xmath17 .",
    "+ we have performed a measurement of the dynamic range of the prototype . as a first step ,",
    "the prototype has been kept in single photoelectron condition attenuating the incident laser light with an appropriate combination of the grey filters .",
    "then , the number of the expected photoelectrons ( @xmath18 ) has been gradually increased reducing the attenuation . at each step , the vsipmt output has been measured ( number of fired cells , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the experimental points are plotted in fig .",
    "[ dyn_50um ] .",
    "the measured values are distributed accordingly to the optimal dynamic range curve up to @xmath19 . in correspondence to this value , a saturation effect starts to appear , with the following points increasingly deviating from the theoretical curve .",
    "this represents a robust hint for a too strong focusing .",
    "if such condition holds , the effective number of fired sipm cells ( @xmath20 ) is smaller with respect to the optimal case , therefore the vsipmt dynamic range curve is given by eq .",
    "[ dyn_vsipmt ] with @xmath20 replacing @xmath11 .",
    "+ @xmath20 has been estimated fitting the measured points to the theoretical curve of eq .",
    "[ dyn_vsipmt]the resulting curve , plotted in fig . [ dyn_50um ] ( blue ) , indicates a number of effective cells of @xmath21 , corresponding to a photoelectron beam spot size of @xmath22 .",
    "such value is in fair agreement with the indications provided by the manufacturer .         + the prototype under test has been realized with the primary aim of testing the working principle of the device and hence its feasibility .",
    "no dedicated study has been performed about focusing , therefore the adopted solution is not optimized , thus explaining the reduced dynamic range with respect to the optimal case .",
    "+ it is worth to notice that there is plenty of room to improve the dynamic range in a second generation of vsipmt prototypes , with the adoption of a sipm with a larger number of pixels ( striking a balance with the fill factor ) and with the realization of an optimized focusing for the maximization of the effective number of fired sipm cells .",
    "vsipmt prototypes show excellent performances : unrivalled photon counting capability , low power consumption ( thanks to the absence of the voltage divider ) , a very easy stabilization and a small tts ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "all these features are due to a new high gain concept , thus not implying any additional cost .",
    "+ on the other side , these devices also suffer of some drawbacks as high dark count rate and small linear range , the latter related to the number of pixels of the mppc . both problems are being studied .",
    "the former can be partially solved by using the new generation of mppc by hamamatsu , already available for sale , for which the dark count rate is reduced by a factor 10 .",
    "the dynamic range of this device strongly depends on the number of pixels of the sipm used , the greater is the number of pixels the wider is the dynamic range . for these reasons , a sipm with new optimized shape and",
    "a new focusing technique is currently under study .",
    "+ although r&d work is still needed to assess the ultimate features of the proposed device , the results presented in this paper unambiguously prove the feasibility of the new vsipmt photodetector .",
    "furthermore , it has been demonstrated that the vsipmt has the potentiality to fulfill the requirements of the next generation of astroparticle physics experiments .",
    "the authors wish to thank hamamatsu photonics k. k. for the realization of the prototypes and for the support during the characterization phase , and mr mario borriello for the constant help and for the precious technical support during setup and testing activities ."
