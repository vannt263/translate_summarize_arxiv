    "recently we reported on new investigations of the mg@xmath0 uv - absorption spectrum @xcite .",
    "major motivation of the experimental efforts was a reliable characterization of the cold collision properties of ground state atoms by the molecular ground state , which were derived from the long range behaviour of the potential energy curve ( pec ) and given in the form of scattering lengths . with the new data , incorporating also data from former spectroscopic work @xcite",
    "as much as possible , paper @xcite exclusively handles the properties of the molecular ground state and concentrates on different mathematical forms to represent the pec .",
    "the spectroscopic data on the upper state level structure is more complex , and its evaluation will be reported in the present paper . due to the better precision compared to @xcite and the computer aided evaluation of the spectral structures , perturbations manifesting themselves by shifts of the observed spectral lines",
    "could be identified .",
    "the ( 1)@xmath3 state was included as the most plausible perturber in the modeling of the excited state data to derive the pec for state .",
    "the most abundant isotopes of the alkaline earth metals have nuclear spin zero , thus there is no hyperfine structure , a fact which simplifies the spectral structures .",
    "similar investigations have been carried out in the past on ca@xmath0 and sr@xmath0 for the ground states @xcite and for some of the lowest excited electronic states @xcite . generally , all those examples revealed substantial differences between pecs from up to date _",
    "ab initio _ calculations and pecs deduced from spectroscopic observations .",
    "an overview of the electronic structure of the mg@xmath0 molecule is given in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the data of the pecs have been taken from amaran et al . @xcite .",
    "the pec of the ground state  has been omitted for an enlarged view of the excited states .",
    "the thick blue curves are the pecs which are relevant in this report .",
    "the   state , on which we focus in this paper , is crossed by a @xmath6 state from below , which comes from the asymptotic combination of mg ( @xmath7 ) and mg(@xmath8 ) .",
    "a coupling of this state to the a state by spin - orbit coupling will cause predissociation , but this was not identified within our recorded spectra .",
    "the inner branch of the  state potential is close to that of the ( 1)@xmath3 state , in former _ ab initio _",
    "calculations by czuchaj et al .",
    "@xcite a crossing of both pecs was predicted .",
    "we propose below the  state as being responsible for the observed perturbations in the a - x spectrum .",
    "the crossings of the @xmath9 and @xmath10  play no role in the present work because of their gerade symmetry .    in the next section",
    "we will give a short overview of the relevant experimental details .",
    "then we will describe the evaluation of the spectra and the treatment of the data . in section [ modeling ]",
    "the model approaches will be presented .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion of the results and a short conclusion .",
    "the experimental methods employed are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the mg@xmath0 vapour was generated in a stainless steel heat pipe containing mg metal at a typical operating temperature of the central part of 1100  k , with about 40 to 80  hpa ar as buffer gas .",
    "absorption spectra were taken with a broad band light source , reducing the bandwidth to between 400  nm and 250  nm by optical filtering .",
    "a high resolution fourier - transform spectrometer ( fts ) with a typical resolution of about 0.1  @xmath11 , which corresponds well to the doppler width of the spectral lines , was employed to obtain the spectra .",
    "about 300 interferograms were finally averaged to obtain the absorption spectrum actually used for evaluation .",
    "in addition , laser induced fluorescence was recorded , excited by an uv ar - ion laser or a frequency doubled tisa laser , respectively , employing the fts for the dispersion of the fluorescence .",
    "the fluorescence progressions having in common one excited level offer substantial information on the lower state and assign clearly the rotational quantum number of the excited level which helps significantly in the assignment of the dense absorption spectrum .",
    "characteristic examples of recorded spectra of these kinds were given in @xcite .",
    "for the assignment of the spectral lines we found complete agreement to the previous work by balfour and douglas @xcite",
    ". however , due to the isotopic abundance of natural mg ( @xmath12 mg about 79  % , @xmath13 mg about 10  % , @xmath14 mg about 11  % ) , the spectra are a mixture of six isotopologues in the molecular gas with abundances of 62  % , 7.9  % , 8.7  % , 1.1  % , 1.0  % and 1.2  % for @xmath12mg@xmath0 , @xmath12mg@xmath13 mg , @xmath12mg@xmath14 mg , @xmath13mg@xmath14 mg , @xmath13mg@xmath0 , @xmath14mg@xmath0 , respectively . the three most abundant isotopic forms could be finally identified in our spectra . for the temperatures of 1100 k necessary in the experiment ,",
    "all rovibrational levels of the ground state have a significant thermal population due to the small vibrational frequency and the large equilibrium internuclear distance of a typical van der waals state .",
    "thus the absorption spectrum shows high density of lines and essentially no observed spectral feature is due to a single line , but a blend of lines .",
    "this limitation in unraveling the spectra could partly be overcome by using a computer program , which simulates the spectra and can also fit an artificial spectrum to a selected window of the observed spectrum .",
    "it is based on calculating eigenvalues from intermediate pecs , representing the transition frequencies as differences between eigenvalues of upper and lower electronic states and applying standard line profiles for simulation of the spectrum in the selected window . in this way",
    "the overlap of lines could be accounted for , at least for the strong lines and for the three most abundant isotopologues @xmath12mg@xmath0 , @xmath12mg@xmath13 mg and @xmath12mg@xmath14 mg . the abundance of the other isotopologues is small enough to neglect their influence within the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra . due to the very flat and wide ground state potential , the intensities of the spectral lines not only depend on thermal population of the ground state levels , but also on the significant change of the franck - condon factors with rotation . as a consequence nearly no vibrational band ( @xmath5  -  @xmath15 ) can be observed over the full span of rotational quantum numbers , but always fragments with a certain limited range of rotational quantum numbers appear .",
    "an iterative procedure was pursued increasing the range of quantum numbers of assigned spectral lines and improving the intermediate pecs step by step .",
    "we could replace most of the lines assigned in @xcite by new frequencies being more precise by about a factor of three . by the evaluation procedure it was also possible to identify parts in bands where",
    "the lines were shifted with respect to their expected positions , unveiling regions of perturbations in the upper state by a yet unknown electronic state .",
    "we note that in paper @xcite we limited the data set to lines , which were obviously not perturbed , restricting the range of vibrational quantum numbers v  @xmath4  28 in the upper state  for getting a precise description of the ground state .",
    "we used the pecs determined with this set of data for lower and upper state to assign lines with higher vibrational quantum numbers @xmath5 .    when the difference between frequencies of newly assigned lines and their predictions increased by more than a typical full width at half maximum ( fwhm , about 0.22 @xmath11 ) , a new pec was determined now including those new lines . with this iterative procedure",
    "we could benefit from better prediction qualities due to the stiffness of the potential representation compared to a dunham parameter approach and could extend the span of vibrational levels in the upper state beyond @xmath5 = 46 . during the assignment process",
    ", we also identified various regions , where the lines were shifted systematically with respect to the prediction .",
    "the lines starting from lower j are first always higher in energy up to a maximum shift at certain j , then switch sign to negative shift and reduce in magnitude when going to higher j. this is a clear signature of a perturbation by coupling to another level system which has a larger rotational constant than the a state .",
    "so we identified these regions as being perturbed , as soon as the shifts were larger in magnitude than about 0.06 @xmath11 .",
    "the shifts could be verified by finding other lines with similar shifts connecting to the same upper level .",
    "besides the main isotopologue @xmath12mg@xmath0 , only few lines of mixed isotopes could be sufficiently precisely determined due to their mostly low intensities and significant spectral overlap .",
    "therefore , the main body of data for other isotopes stems from the absorption measurements on a sample of enriched @xmath14mg@xmath0 by balfour and douglas @xcite .    above @xmath5",
    "= 46 levels lines with additional perturbations were found which indicates the existence of an additional perturber and hinders unique assignment .",
    "therefore , the data set used for the modeling presented here comprises only lines with 1  @xmath4  @xmath5  @xmath4  46 .",
    "transitions to @xmath5 = 0 were not found , this failure could be finally confirmed by the prediction of small franck - condon factors .",
    "generally , for each excited level we determined at least the p line and the r line of the most prominent vibrational band in order to be sure about having identified the proper line in the dense spectrum . in some cases also lines of less intense bands were used in addition for verification , as far as such lines were intense enough for unique assignment . in the perturbed regions no extra line could be identified with certainty , so for the perturbing state there are no direct observations . in total",
    ", we used 5844 lines and their uncertainties range from 0.015 to 0.3  @xmath11 depending on the signal - to - noise ratio and the degree of overlap of lines .",
    "the data from @xcite have an uncertainty of 0.05  @xmath11 .",
    "the whole data set is available in the electronic supplement @xcite .",
    "because the ground state is well known from @xcite , we calculate term energies of the upper state  by adding the energy of the ground state level , which results as eigenvalue of the analytical potential given in table i of @xcite , to the measured transition frequency .",
    "all energies are referred to the minimum of the electronic ground state .",
    "an overview of the data available is given in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the full squares mark the level energies in the vibrational interval 1  @xmath4  @xmath5  @xmath4  46 .",
    "the larger ( red ) squares mark regions , where levels were identified as being perturbed using only a single state fit of the  state .",
    "the full lines mark the course of energy levels of the later proposed perturbing electronic state assigned as ( 1)@xmath3 ( see section [ coupled ] ) .      in a first approach",
    "the experimentally determined level energies are used for a direct fit of a pec for  neglecting the perturbations . the radial schrdinger equation with an effective hamiltonian ( e.g. @xcite ) for an electronic state with symmetry @xmath17 of the form @xmath18\\cdot j(j+1)}{2\\mu r^2 } \\label{eq:5 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "is solved to find eigenvalues ; @xmath19 is the reduced mass and @xmath20 is planck s constant .",
    "u(r ) is the born - oppenheimer potential and u@xmath21 and @xmath22 adiabatic and non - adiabatic born - oppenheimer corrections ( boc ) , respectively , which could become determinable if more than one isotopologue or high rotational quantum numbers are involved .",
    "details are given in @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic correction u@xmath21(r ) is mass dependent and can only be distinguished from u(r ) if data of different isotopic species of the molecule are available .",
    "it had to be taken into account for the  state , as was already mentioned by vidal et al . @xcite .",
    "the non - adiabatic boc was not significant in the present evaluation despite rotational quantum numbers j up to 87 . during the fit the eigenvalues for the levels",
    "are calculated with the current potential .",
    "the difference of the calculated energy to the experimentally determined one is used in a weighted least squares fit in which the parameters of the pec representation are adjusted to yield a minimum @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the observed energies , @xmath26 the calculated values and @xmath27 the estimated uncertainties of the experimental values . for the fitting of the nonlinear problem we use the minuit program package @xcite .    for the representation of the pec of the  state",
    "the `` x - representation '' is used .",
    "the pec u(r ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) is cut according to physical considerations at the transition points r@xmath28 and r@xmath29 into three parts .",

    "the parameter @xmath36 determines the pole at small @xmath37 , and allows to some degree to account for the asymmetry of the potential , and @xmath38 is the expansion center , chosen typically close to the equilibrium internuclear distance r@xmath39 .",
    "those two parameters are found once by initially modeling a preliminary rkr potential with the analytic form ( [ uanal ] ) and kept fixed in subsequent fits of the parameters a@xmath28 .",
