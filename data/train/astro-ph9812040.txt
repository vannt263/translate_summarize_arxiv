    "since bright spiral disk galaxies contain most of the h  i mass in the nearby universe ( @xcite ) , it has always seemed likely that these types of galaxies  or at least their progenitors  would be the origin of the high - redshift dly@xmath0  systems seen in background qso spectra .",
    "the detection of @xmath4 dly@xmath0  systems ( @xcite ) has now made it possible to search for the galaxies which cause the absorption .",
    "although redshifts are largely unavailable for the objects imaged , recent observations suggest that a wide range of morphological types are responsible for the absorption ( @xcite ) , and that bright spiral galaxies do _ not _ dominate the dly@xmath0  population . in particular , several low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies have been found close to qso sightlines ( @xcite ) , while in one case , only an lsb or dwarf galaxy can account for the complete non - detection of a suitable galaxy responsible for a @xmath5 dly@xmath0line ( @xcite ) .",
    "further evidence that dly@xmath0  systems may not originate in bright spiral galaxies , even at higher redshift , comes from measurements of the metallicity of the absorbing gas .",
    "the abundances of alpha elements in dly@xmath0  systems do not appear to be enhanced relative to iron group elements but similar to the solar value ( molaro , centurion & vladillo 1998 ; centurion et  al .",
    "1998 ) , while the overall metallicity seems to remain low even at @xmath6 ( pettini et al .  1998 ) .",
    "these results suggest that dly@xmath0  lines may actually arise in systems which are less common than the main star - forming disks we see around us today . in this _",
    "letter _ we use our model of disk formation and evolution to explore differences in metallicity , dust content , and neutral - gas mass density between high surface brightness ( hsb ) and lsb galaxies .",
    "we find that we are able to better reproduce the observational data with models of lsb galaxies , and predict how future abundance measurements may be able to further differentiate between the two .",
    "several authors have shown how differences in surface brightness between galaxies can be readily understood if lsb galaxies are hosted in dark halos with values of the spin parameter , @xmath7 , of the dark halo ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the angular momentum , @xmath10 is the total energy and @xmath11 is the total mass of the halo ) larger than those of hsb galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "jimenez et al . ( 1998 ) used a detailed chemo - spectro - photometric disk model to show ( abandoning the assumption of a constant @xmath12 ratio ) that not only surface brightness , but also color , color gradients and metallicity of lsb disks can be explained if the spin parameter is larger for lsb than for hsb galaxies .    in order to investigate the properties of both hsb and lsb disks , and to determine whether their characteristics are akin to those identified in dly@xmath0systems , we have computed models of galactic disks with @xmath13 ( hsbs ) and @xmath14 ( lsbs ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the model is described in detail in jimenez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and we only summarize it here .",
    "we assume that the specific angular momentum of baryonic matter is the same as the dark matter and that gas settles into a given dark halo until centrifugally supported .",
    "we also assume that the dark matter profile is that found in numerical simulations ( @xcite ) , although using the isothermal sphere profile does not significantly change the computed initial surface density for the settling disk .",
    "once the initial surface density of the disks has been computed , we used the schmidt law ( @xcite ) to compute the star formation rate . in particular , the sfr law adopted is @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and where @xmath18 is the gas surface density and @xmath19 is the total mass surface density .",
    "the hsb disks have a initial burst of star formation which then declines with time , while the lsb galaxies have constant , but less active , star - formation . the primordial gas infall rate in the disk",
    "is assumed to be the same function of total surface density as used in models of the milky way ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the infall rate is higher in the center than in the outermost regions of the disk , with the infall law expressed as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the time - scale for the formation of the disk at a radius @xmath22",
    ". the values of @xmath21 are chosen to fit the present time radial distribution of the gas surface density in the disk . in analogy with what is required for the disk of the milky way",
    ", we assumed @xmath21 is increasing towards larger radii ( see table  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath23 is the abundance of element @xmath24 in the infalling gas and the chemical composition is assumed to be primordial .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is obtained by requiring the surface density now to be @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 . the evolution of several chemical species ( h , d , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , fe and zn ) , as well as the global metallicity @xmath28 , is followed by taking into account detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions ( jimenez  et  al .",
    "the imf is taken from scalo ( 1986 ) .",
    "for simplicity , we have adopted an einstein - desitter universe ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 ) .",
    "non - zero values of @xmath33 actually strengthen the results discussed below .",
    "the initial goal of our modelling was to explore any differences in gas metallicity between hsb and lsb disks , to determine whether the measurements of [ zn / h ] now available for dly@xmath0  systems could discriminate between the two types of galaxies . in figure 1",
    "we plot the values of [ zn / h ] found by pettini  et  al .",
    "( 1997 and refs . therein ; 1998 ) against the redshift of the absorption systems .",
    "our models enable us to plot the metallicity of gas disks as a function of redshift for both a given galactic radius , @xmath22 , and for a formation redshift .",
    "hence , in figure 1_a _ , we plot the evolution in the metallicity of an lsb disk , forming at @xmath34 , at @xmath35 , 1.0 , 2.5 , and @xmath36  kpc .",
    "we take @xmath36  kpc to be the outer limit at which an lsb would still give rise to a dly@xmath0  line ; our models predict @xmath37(h  i)@xmath38  @xmath39  at this radius for an lsb baryonic mass of @xmath40 .",
    "this agrees well with observed h  i surface densities toward nearby lsb galaxies at similar radii ( de blok , mcgaugh , & van der hulst 1996 ) .    in figure",
    "1_b _ , we show the same variation in metallicity for @xmath41 6  kpc but with the galaxy forming at @xmath423.2 , 2.2 and 1.4 .",
    "figure 1_a _ clearly shows that the predicted metallicities of lsb galaxies fit the observed data very well , particularly at outer radii , where the absorption cross - section will be largest and hence where the majority of qso sightlines will intercept .",
    "figure 1_b _ demonstrates , however , that such lsb disks must form at @xmath43 , and evolve slowly for such a model to be consistent with the data .",
    "in contrast , figure 1_c _ shows the variation of metallicity with redshift for an hsb galaxy , again forming at @xmath44 , for @xmath450 , 4.0 , 6.0 and @xmath46  kpc .",
    "the figure shows that hsb galaxies have enriched their isms much faster than lsb galaxies , leading to gas metallicities higher than observed .",
    "however , this does not rule out hsb disks as potential absorbers .",
    "figure 1_d _ shows that if hsb galaxy halos form over the range of redshifts measured for dly@xmath0  systems , as is indeed the case in cdm cosmogonies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , then it is possible to reproduce the [ zn / h ] measurements . in this case , most of the dly@xmath0  systems would be proto - galaxies in the very early stages of their evolution  it takes only 0.3  gyr for hsb disks to reach [ zn / h ] @xmath47 @xmath48 , close to the average measured value .",
    "we note that in our models , however , these proto - galaxies have not yet formed rotating disks , hence we would not expect the velocity profiles of metals absorption lines in dly@xmath0  systems to be indicative of rotating disks .",
    "the fact that the profiles of metal lines _ do _ appear to support rotating thick - disk models ( @xcite ) tends to favor lsb disks .",
    "we note , however , that it remains possible that the initial merging of galaxy halos in a cdm - like scenario could still give rise to the observed line profiles ( haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch 1998 ) .",
    "one possible way to distinguish between slowly evolving lsb disks and a continuously forming population of hsb galaxies is to consider the evolution of the dust content of each galaxy type .",
    "figure  2 shows the dust formation rate for hsb and lsb disks at different radii ( each radius normalized to @xmath49 m@xmath50 ) .",
    "the amount of dust produced by each generation of stars was accounted for by using the model of draine & lee ( 1984 ) . as expected , hsb disks form about twice as much dust as their lsb counterparts due to their higher metallicity . more importantly , however , hsb galaxies produce most of their dust during the first gyr , reaching a maximum at an age of 0.3  gyr . on the other hand ,",
    "lsb galaxies produce virtually no dust at radii larger than @xmath51 kpc .",
    "therefore , a population of continually forming proto - disks should quickly begin to obscure background qsos , removing hsb disks from dly@xmath0  samples , as suggested by other researchers ( @xcite ) .",
    "lsb galaxies , of course , remain largely unobscured , and would show up readily against background qsos . if , in reality , it is a mixture of lsb and hsb galaxies which actually give rise to dly@xmath0  systems , such an effect would at least explain why lsb galaxies have so readily been found responsible for low redshift dly@xmath0  absorbers .",
    "our model predicts one more difference between the observable properties of dly@xmath0  systems depending on whether hsb or lsb disks are responsible .",
    "dly@xmath0systems have been used to infer the evolution in the cosmological mass density of neutral gas in the universe , @xmath52 , from @xmath53 . in figure 3",
    "we reproduce the values of @xmath52 as a function of redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also show how h  i gas is consumed by stars in our disk models , both for hsb ( dashed line ) and lsb ( continuous line ) galaxies .",
    "the curves are normalized such that that @xmath52 for lsb galaxies is zero at @xmath54 .",
    "the true value of @xmath52 for lsb galaxies clearly lies somewhere between 0 ( an extreme limit which would assume that lsb disks have used up all their gas  at odds with the observations ) and that observed for galaxies today , a value dominated by the contribution from spirals and irregular galaxies ( rao & briggs 1993 ) . as can be seen in figure 3",
    ", however , this range is extremely small , and it matters little whether we set @xmath52 for lsb disks to zero or the value observed for all galaxy types .",
    "surprisingly , the hsb galaxies do not reproduce the data particularly well  the amount of gas needed at high - redshift to reproduce the neutral gas density measured in the local universe is much higher than observed .",
    "on the other hand , lsb disks fit the data much better , since they have less efficient star formation and thus transform less h  i into stars .",
    "it would seem , therefore , that dly@xmath0  systems are very _ inefficient _ star producers .",
    "the figure is also important in demonstrating that there need not be many lsb galaxies in the nearby universe to account for the number of dly@xmath0  systems found at high redshift . although plausible arguments have been made that the size and number density of lsb galaxies in the local universe are sufficient to explain the frequency of dly@xmath0  systems at high redshift ( @xcite ) , our models show that even if _ no _ lsb disks remained today , their gradual slow consumption of h  i over time best fits the observed values of @xmath52 , and that hsb disks simply convert h  i into stars too efficiently to account for those measurements .",
    "since the star formation histories in lsb and hsb galaxies are so different , our models make it possible to predict differences in the @xmath55nucleid to iron - peak element ratios for the two types of galaxies . in particular , we would expect that at a fixed epoch hsb disks have [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios around zero or less and lower than [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in lsb disks .",
    "this because at the same epoch lsb disks have lower fe abundances than @xmath0-element abundances relative to hsb disks .",
    "this difference is mostly due to the fact that @xmath0-elements are produced on very short timescales by type ii sne whereas fe is produced on long timescales ( from several tenths of million years to several gyr ) by type ia sne .",
    "therefore , the different star formation history affects iron more than @xmath0-elements .",
    "this is contrary to what happens if one looks at the [ @xmath0/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation at a fixed [ fe / h ] instead of at a fixed epoch . in this case , galaxies with lower star formation rate shows lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios ( @xcite ) than systems with higher star formation rates .",
    "this effect is clearly seen in figure  4 where we plot the redshift evolution of [ @xmath0/zn ] for lsb ( continuous line ) and hsb ( dashed line ) galaxies formed at @xmath56 and 4.0 , which encompasses a reasonable range in redshift for disk formation .",
    "as expected , the lsb disks have super - solar [ @xmath0/zn ] ratios during most of their evolution .",
    "the hsb galaxies exhibit super - solar ratios only during their first gyr , but have mainly sub - solar ratios for the rest of their lives .",
    "it can be seen that any measured [ @xmath0/zn ] ratio at a given redshift is unique in determining whether the absorption originates in an lsb or hsb disk  although we only plot the curves after the first 0.4  gyr of the disks formation , before which the [ @xmath0/zn ] ratio move vertically to higher values .",
    "unfortunately , only two [ @xmath0/zn ] ratios have been measured in dly@xmath0  systems ( for @xmath57 systems ) , both of which are from observations of s  ii lines ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs .  therein ) , plotted as diamonds in figure  4 .",
    "both measurements have large errors , and it is clear that many , more accurate observations are needed in the future to determine the nature of the dly@xmath0  population in the universe .    99 de blok , w. j. g. , mcgaugh , s. s. , van der hulst , j. m. 1996 , mnras , 283 , 18 p. , le brun v. , bergeron j. , deharveng j .- m . 1998 , , 333 , 841 centurion m. , bonifacio p. , molaro p. , vladilo g. 1998 , j.  j. , spergel d.  n. , summers f.  j. 1997 , , 482 , 659 b.  t. , lee h.  m. 1984 , , 285 , 89 s.  m. , efstathiou g. 1980 , , 193 , 189 s.  m. , pei y.  c. 1993 , , 402 , 479 haehnelt , m. g. , steinmetz , m. , & rauch , m. , 1998 , apj , 495 , 647 c. , bothun g. 1997 , , 35 , 267 jimenez r. , heavens a. , hawkins m. , padoan p. 1997",
