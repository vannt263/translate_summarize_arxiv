    "studies of heavy - quark jets , i.e.  charm and bottom jets , are important for a range of reasons .",
    "they are of intrinsic interest because charm and bottom are the flavours for which there exists the most direct correspondence between parton level production and the observed hadron level .",
    "they have the potential to provide information on the @xmath2- and @xmath1-quark parton distribution function ( pdf ) , which are the only components of proton structure that are thought to be generated entirely perturbatively from the dglap evolution of the other flavours .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1-jets enter in many collider searches , notably because they are produced in the decays of various heavy particles , e.g.  top quarks , the higgs boson ( if light ) and numerous particles appearing in proposed extensions of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .    within the sm",
    "a range of production channels exist for heavy - quark jets , e.g.  pure qcd production or in association with heavy bosons ( @xmath6 ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most fundamental measurement of heavy - quark jet production is the inclusive heavy - quark jet spectrum , which is dominated by pure qcd contributions .",
    "predictions for this sort of quantity have always been obtained using calculations in which the @xmath2 or @xmath1 quark has been explicitly taken to be massive while all other lighter masses are neglected .",
    "an example is the inclusive @xmath1-jet spectrum measured by cdf  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : cdf - bjets ] shows the ratio of the experimental measurement to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation of  @xcite .",
    "a striking feature of this plot is the size of the theoretical ( scale variation ) uncertainties ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "one notes in particular that there is a significant region where the experimental uncertainties are smaller than the theoretical ones .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1-jet theory uncertainties are considerably larger than the corresponding ones for the normal ( light ) jet inclusive spectrum ( @xmath8-@xmath9 ) , see for example  @xcite .    -jet spectrum to nlo prediction .",

    "it is for this reason that the scale dependence ( middle panels ) is large .",
    "one might think that a calculation with mc@nlo  @xcite should do better , since it includes both nlo and all - order resummed logarithmically enhanced terms .",
    "this turns out not to be the case , as can be seen from its persistently large scale dependence .- factor has been shown for mc@nlo because the lo result is not unambiguously defined . ] essentially , while mc@nlo contains a good matching between the nlo @xmath1-production calculation and the @xmath1-quark fragmentation logarithms in herwig , it does not match with the logarithmic enhancements contained in herwig for @xmath1-quark production , but rather just replaces them with the nlo result .",
    "the poor convergence of the perturbative series is related to the different channels for heavy quark production . at leading order ( lo ) , only the so - called flavour creation channel ( fcr ) is present , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a generic light parton ( quark or gluon ) . at nlo ,",
    "two new channels open up , often referred to as the flavour excitation ( fex ) and gluon splitting channels ( gsp ) .",
    ", and so there is distinct physical meaning associated with each channel",
    ". furthermore one can give a precise , measurable definition to each channel , e.g.  using an exclusive variant of the flavour jet algorithm discussed below . though there will be some arbitrariness in any such definition , relating to the choice of parameters of the jet algorithm , this arbitrariness is no more troubling conceptually or practically than the jet - definition dependence that arises when determining the number of jets in an event . ] in the former , a gluon from one of the incoming hadrons splits collinearly into a @xmath24-pair and one of those @xmath1-quarks enters the hard @xmath25 scattering . in the gluon splitting process ,",
    "the hard scattering process is of the form @xmath26 , and one of the final - state light partons ( at nlo always a gluon ) splits collinearly into a @xmath24-pair ( a jet containing both @xmath1 and @xmath27 is considered to be a @xmath1-jet in standard definitions ) .",
    "the various channels can be conveniently separated with a parton shower monte carlo generator such as herwig  @xcite , where one can determine the underlying hard channel from the hard process in the herwig event record . with @xmath28 ( the value of @xmath18 that places initial and final - state radiation on the same footing for @xmath17 type jet algorithms ) . ]",
    "their relative contributions to the total @xmath1-jet spectrum are shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : kfact+channels ] .",
    "one sees that the supposedly lo channel ( fcr ) is nearly always smaller than the two channels that at fixed order enter only at nlo ( fex and gsp ) .",
    "this is because both nlo channels receive a strong enhancement from collinear logarithms , going as @xmath29 for flavour excitation  @xcite and @xmath30 for gluon splitting ( @xmath31 )  @xcite .",
    "three approaches come to mind for increasing the accuracy of the @xmath1-jet spectrum prediction .",
    "the most obvious ( and hardest ) is to carry out the full massive next - to - next - to - leading order calculation . aside from being beyond the limit of today s technology , such an approach would still leave many of the higher order logarithms uncalculated and so would only partially improve the situation .",
    "a second approach would be to carry out the explicit resummation of both the incoming and outgoing collinear logarithms .",
    "the technology for each resummation on its own is well - known at next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy ( nlla )  @xcite , though significant effort would probably be necessary to assemble them together effectively . in both of the above approaches ,",
    "the largest residual uncertainties are likely to be associated with the channel with the most logarithms , gluon splitting .",
    "this channel however does not even correspond to one s physical idea of a @xmath1-jet , i.e.  one induced by a hard @xmath1-quark and it seems somehow unnatural to include it at all as part of one s @xmath1-jet spectrum .",
    "we therefore propose a third approach to improving the accuracy of the prediction of the @xmath1-jet spectrum .",
    "it is a two - pronged approach .",
    "firstly , one uses a definition of @xmath1-jets which maintains the correspondence between partonic flavour and jet flavour . specifically , we take the flavour-@xmath17 algorithm of  @xcite . within this algorithm , described in section  [ sec : algo ] ,",
    "a jet containing equal number of @xmath1 quarks and @xmath1 antiquarks is considered to be a light jet , so that jets that contain a @xmath1 and @xmath32 from the gluon splitting channel do not contribute to the @xmath1-jet spectrum .",
    "the use of this kind of algorithm already leads to some reduction of the theoretical uncertainty on the @xmath1-jet spectrum with a standard massive calculation ( e.g.  with mcfm ) .",
    "further improvement can be obtained by exploiting the fact that the logarithms of @xmath33 that remain are those associated with flavour excitation , which coincide with those resummed in the @xmath1-quark parton distribution function ( pdf ) at scale @xmath20 .",
    "if one uses a @xmath1-quark pdf to resum these logarithms , no other logarithms @xmath34 appear in the rest of the calculation , so that one can safely take the limit @xmath35 and one misses only corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath36 ( possibly with additional logarithms ) .",
    "the validity of this procedure is a consequence of the infrared safety of the jet - flavour even in the massless limit ( see later).-flavour scheme ' , with resummed @xmath1-quark pdfs has been used before in mcfm for @xmath37 and @xmath38 production  @xcite . in that case , because a non - flavour jet algorithm was used , it was necessary to supplement the results with an explicit massive calculation of the nlo gluon - splitting process .",
    "we thank john campbell for bringing this to our attention . ]",
    "this third approach is therefore the one which is technically the easiest to pursue and which should simultaneously reduce the theoretical uncertainties the most . in section  [ sec : res ]",
    "we present results for @xmath2-and @xmath1-jets using this method .",
    "a similar approach can be used also in different contexts , e.g.  recently the flavour - algorithm of  @xcite has been used to define the @xmath39 forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath1 in an infrared - safe way , making it possible to compute this quantity at nnlo using a massless qcd calculation  @xcite .",
    "several issues deserve detailed discussion in the above approach .",
    "firstly for moderate values of @xmath20 ( or of the jet energy in @xmath39 ) , finite - mass effects may not be completely negligible .",
    "it is therefore important to determine their size .",
    "we explain briefly how this can be done in section  [ sec : res ] , with further details given in appendix  [ sec : finite - mass - effects ] .",
    "a second issue is an experimental one related to the limited efficiency for the identification of @xmath40 and @xmath41 hadrons .",
    "though not strictly within the remit of a theoretical paper , we do find it useful to discuss various points related to this issue in section  [ sec : expissues ] .",
    "finally we also comment on the question of electroweak effects , in appendix  [ sec : ew ] .",
    "in general , flavour - algorithms provide an ir - safe definition of the flavour of a jet , provided one knows the ( light or heavy ) flavour of each parton involved .",
    "however to study heavy - quark jets it is not necessary to know the flavour of light quarks , because gluons and light flavoured quarks can be considered as flavourless , while one assigns to heavy ( anti)-quarks a flavour 1 ( -1 ) .",
    "we define the heavy - flavour of a ( pseudo)-particle or a jet as its net heavy flavour content , i.e.  the total number of heavy quarks minus heavy antiquarks .",
    "one may alternatively use the sum of the number of quarks and anti - quarks modulo 2 .",
    "flavourless ( flavoured ) objects are then those with ( non-)zero net flavour .",

    "a general consequence of ir - safety is that it allows one to take the limit @xmath63 ( any finite - mass corrections being suppressed by powers of @xmath64 ) as long as collinear singularities associated with incoming heavy quarks are factorised into a heavy quark pdf .",
    "this means that we can compute heavy - quark jet cross sections using a simpler , light - flavour nlo program , rather than a heavy - flavour one  @xcite .",

    "we will comment briefly on @xmath2-jets at the end of the section .",
    "the question of the experimental measurability of @xmath1-jet definition can only truly be settled by a detailed experimental study .",
    "however several points lead us to believe that such a measurement might well be possible .",
    "our discussion here is inspired in part by that in  @xcite , which measured @xmath89 azimuthal correlations at the tevatron , including the region of small angular separation between the @xmath40 and @xmath54 , which is the experimentally non - trivial region also for our definition of @xmath1-jets .",
    "one should be aware in the discussion below that the correspondence between our needs and what was done in  @xcite is only partial , insofar as the measured @xmath40-hadrons were not used as inputs to a jet algorithm , and also had lower typical transverse momenta than would the @xmath40-hadrons in @xmath1-jet studies.s the fraction of @xmath24 pairs at small angles will be increased , making the analysis more difficult , on the other hand the secondary vertices will be displaced further from the primary vertex and this should facilitate the analysis . the extent to which these two effects cancel",
    "can only be determined by a full experimental study . ]    in an ideal world the input to the jet flavour algorithm would be a list of momenta of all particles in the event together with information about which particles correspond to a @xmath40-hadron .",
    "we are allowed to use @xmath40-hadrons rather than @xmath1 quarks in the algorithm because the flavoured jets are infrared and collinear safe and the fragmentation of a @xmath1 quark into a @xmath40-hadron should have no more effect than collinear radiation from the @xmath1 quark .",
    "experimentally one has information on charged tracks and their momenta , calorimeter energy deposits , and @xmath1-tags .",
    "the latter typically exploit the long lifetime of @xmath40-hadrons , which causes the @xmath40-hadron to decay some small but measurable distance away from the primary interaction vertex of the event .",
    "if the @xmath40-hadron decay products include two or more charged particles then a secondary vertex may be identified from the intersection of the resulting charged tracks , whereas if the decay involves only one charged track then one may still obtain a @xmath1-tag based on the finite impact parameter between that track and the primary vertex .",
    "often the @xmath1-tagging is restricted to tracks within hard jets , so as to reduce certain backgrounds .",
    "current @xmath1-tagging abilities do nt correspond to our ` ideal world ' scenario for a variety of reasons .",
    "firstly , since one often sees only a subset of the @xmath40-hadron decay products , one does not know the @xmath40-hadron momentum .",
    "this should not matter since the jet algorithm will in its first steps recombine the observed charged tracks in the decay with the calorimeter energy deposits from the neutral particles ( other than neutrinos ) in the decay .",
    "a second problem is that whereas experiments first search for jets and then do the @xmath1-tagging , we need the information on @xmath1-tags before running the jet algorithm .",
    "this should not be a major obstacle : one may first identify jets using a standard @xmath17 or cone algorithm , with large radius parameter ( so as to catch most @xmath1 s , as done in @xcite ) , carry out the @xmath1-tagging , and then run the flavour algorithm using that information .",
    "the third and potentially most serious issue relates to the finite efficiency for @xmath1-tagging , and notably for double @xmath1-tagging inside a single jet .",
    "the efficiency for @xmath1-tagging is limited for various reasons : partly because of the need to place cuts on impact parameter to avoid backgrounds from decays of charm hadrons , which also decay a small but measurable distance from their production vertex ( such backgrounds are partially reduced also by using the invariant mass of the decay products ) ; and partly because of issues related to detector limitations .",
    "double @xmath1-tagging for a pair of @xmath40-hadrons that are close in rapidity and azimuth ( i.e.  in the same jet ) is considered particularly difficult , because of the need to be sure that , if one sees two secondary vertices in a jet , they are nt ` sequential tags ' from a single @xmath1 , i.e.  the vertex from a @xmath40-hadron decaying to a @xmath41-hadron plus other particles , followed by the vertex from the @xmath41 decay .",
    "double @xmath1-tagging inside a single jet is nevertheless possible , albeit currently with limited efficiency , as has been shown in  @xcite .",
    "this is important because our algorithm relies on jets with with two @xmath1 s inside being identified as light jets .    to evaluate the impact of finite efficiencies , we consider the following simple model .",
    "we suppose the efficiency for tagging a single @xmath40-hadron to be @xmath85 , and the efficiency for tagging two @xmath40-hadrons that are well - separated ( i.e.  in separate jets ) to be @xmath90 .",
    "typical values for @xmath85 are @xmath91 . in contrast",

    "since @xmath96 and @xmath95 are of the same order of magnitude ( cf .",
    "[ fig : kfact+channels ] ) , the uncertainty on @xmath95 is essentially given by the relative uncertainties on @xmath85 and @xmath103 . if these can both be controlled to within @xmath108 , and from table  iii of @xcite , which contains a breakdown of sources of systematic error ( including that on the relative efficiency for tagging two nearby @xmath1 s compared to two well separated @xmath1 s ) , it seems that @xmath108 is a reasonable value for the uncertainty on @xmath103 . ]",
    "then for @xmath109 , as we have at the tevatron for @xmath110 , the relative uncertainty on @xmath95 should be roughly @xmath111 ( for @xmath112 ) .",
    "for an integrated luminosity of @xmath113 there are @xmath114 events in a bin of width @xmath115 centred at @xmath116 , so statistical errors will be considerably smaller than this , and they are dominated by the relative error on @xmath117 . only at higher energies , when @xmath101 starts to be small , will the enhancement of relative statistical errors due to the limited tagging efficiencies start to matter .",
    "the above discussion is of course somewhat simplistic . in reality",
    ", single and double @xmath1-tagging efficiencies may vary with rapidity , azimuthal separation and transverse momentum , though this ought to be possible to account for ; one should also correct for impurities in the @xmath1-tag samples  based on the uncertainties for the azimuthal correlations given in @xcite , this may be roughly equivalent to doubling the uncertainty on @xmath103 ; and a number of other experimental uncertainties will also contribute , such as energy scale uncertainties . on the other hand ,",
    "steady progress is being made in @xmath1-tagging techniques  @xcite .",
    "one also wonders whether the knowledge that a second @xmath1 is present _ somewhere _ in the event can be used in conjunction with a loose second @xmath1-tag , so as to obtain information about where the second @xmath1 is most likely to be ( in the same jet , in another jet , or down the beam - pipe ) , giving an effectively larger value for @xmath103 ( possibly even @xmath118 ) .",
    "this might be important particularly when statistics are limited , e.g.  at high @xmath73 and also potentially when using flavour information in new - particle searches .",
    "finally , as concerns @xmath2-jets , though they have been the subject of far fewer investigations , we do note that double - tag samples also exist for charmed hadrons  @xcite and that some of the studies on @xmath1-tagging  @xcite also provide information on charm flavour , suggesting that @xmath2-jet studies may also be possible . as for @xmath1-jets , a critical issue in a good measurement of the charm jet spectrum",
    "will be not so much that of obtaining high tagging efficiencies , but rather of a good understanding of those efficiencies even if they are low .",
    "the key finding of this article is that if one uses a properly defined jet - flavour algorithm and exploits its infrared safety to take the massless limit , predictions for heavy - quark jet spectra can be made substantially more accurate than those based on current definitions and nlo massive calculations ( e.g.  mnr  @xcite , mcfm  @xcite or mc@nlo  @xcite ) . when quantified in terms of scale dependence , the qcd theoretical uncertainty is reduced from @xmath119 to @xmath120 .",
    "this is because large higher - order logarithms that first appear at nlo in the massive calculation are either cancelled by the jet definition itself , or else absorbed into the heavy - quark pdf in such a way as to become part of the leading order contribution , so that the nlo term is truly a perturbative correction .",
    "measurements of the heavy - flavour jet spectra as presented here would be of interest for a range of reasons .",
    "heavy - flavour jet spectra measured so far do not distinguish between ` true ' heavy - flavour jets and gluon jets that fragment to @xmath121 .",
    "our definition instead provides just the true flavoured - jet component .",
    "thus for the first time not only is the momentum of a hard parton a meaningful observable quantity ( as _ defined _ by the jet algorithm ) , but so is its flavour .",
    "more generally , heavy - flavour jets , in particular @xmath1-jets , are used in a variety of contexts , including pdf measurements , top quark studies , and searches for new particles .",
    "these can only benefit from a properly defined jet flavour .",
    "one example seen in section  3 is for the charm pdf : current measurements leave considerable room for a non - perturbative ` intrinsic ' charm component in the proton , and given an experimental accuracy that matched the theoretical accuracy of our charm - jet predictions , significant constraints could be placed on this intrinsic component . similarly , a measurement of @xmath122+@xmath2-jet production could help constrain the strange quark pdf  @xcite .    to calculate the heavy - flavour jet spectra shown here , we used nlojet . by default",
    "it sums over the flavours of outgoing partons , so we modified it so as to be able to disentangle the flavour information .",
    "though not completely trivial , this was quite a bit simpler than writing a new nlo monte carlo program for a massless process , and very much simpler than writing the corresponding heavy - flavour monte carlo program .",
    "one could analogously extract the flavour information from the many other nlo monte carlo programs involving massless qcd particles , thus providing heavy - flavour jet predictions in a range of processes .",
    "the usefulness of the flavour information is such that we strongly encourage nlo ( and nnlo ) monte carlo authors to provide it by default .- jets , one could use the prediction given here as a starting point and supplement it with an nlo ( @xmath123 ) calculation of the difference between the experimental definition and ours , which starts only at @xmath124 . in principle , given the recent nlo calculation of the @xmath125jet cross section  @xcite , the technology already exists for such a combination . ]    to supplement the massless calculation , we also investigated residual effects associated with the finite value of the @xmath1-quark mass . for jets with @xmath126 they were of the order of @xmath127 , falling off rapidly at higher @xmath73 .",
    "this was the most laborious part of our study , however given the small size of the effects we believe that it should be safe to neglect them in future nlo calculations of heavy - flavour jets for other processes .",
    "only when considering nnlo heavy - flavour jet predictions , or low values of @xmath20 at nlo , should it become mandatory to include finite mass effects .",
    "the main open question remains that of the experimental usability of our jet - flavour algorithm , mainly because of its reliance on the correct identification of situations where a jet contains both a @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and a @xmath54 ( @xmath128 ) hadron . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : expissues ] , given reasonable relative uncertainties on single and double - tag efficiencies , we believe that it ought to be possible to make an experimental measurement with errors that are not disproportionate compared to theory uncertainties . for the case of @xmath40 hadrons , ongoing improvements in flavour tagging techniques , together with",
    "the use of ` loose ' tagging to identify the second @xmath40 hadron in an event where a first @xmath40 hadron has already been found , might help further .",
    "we look forward therefore to future experimental investigations of heavy - flavour jet spectra with the definition presented here .",
    "we are thankful to matteo cacciari , mario campanelli , monica donofrio , stefano frixione , michelangelo mangano , andrea rizzi , ariel schwartzman , sofia vallecorsa and bryan webber for fruitful discussions .",

    "this work was supported in part by grant anr-05-jcjc-0046 - 01 from the french agence nationale de la recherche .",
    "given the small theoretical errors in the predictions for heavy - quark spectra when an infrared safe algorithm and massless calculation are used , it is important to make sure that the error due to the massless quark approximation remains smaller than the quoted theoretical errors even at moderate values of @xmath20 . in this appendix",
    "we explain how @xmath129 and @xmath130 finite - mass effects can be extracted from the massive nlo calculation in mcfm .",
    "the procedure consists in subtracting from the full , massive nlo result the collinear logarithms which with a massless calculation are resummed into heavy - quark pdfs , any remainder being due to finite mass effects @xmath131 potentially enhanced by logarithms .",
    "the heavy - quark production mechanisms that can give rise to collinear logarithms are flavour excitation and gluon splitting .",
    "however , if an infrared safe algorithm is used the only logarithmic enhancements that survive are those associated with flavour excitation .",
    "we denote generally by @xmath132 any heavy - quark jet cross section corresponding to a set of kinematic cuts and study its dependence on the heavy - quark mass @xmath133 by considering @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is an arbitrary reference mass .",

    "the sums over light - quark flavours ( and over quarks and antiquarks ) are implicit .    in the case of nlo virtual corrections , for calculations in which the heavy - quark flavour is decoupled both in the running coupling and the pdfs ,",
    "the only logarithmically enhanced contribution comes from the subprocess @xmath142 : @xmath143 in the @xmath144 subprocess , logarithmically enhanced virtual corrections from the renormalisation group evolution of the coupling and the gluon distribution cancel .    as an example , in fig .",

    "there has been discussion in the recent literature @xcite of potentially large electroweak ( ew ) corrections to qcd light and heavy ( top ) dijet cross sections .",
    "generally speaking there is consensus that these effects should be modest ( @xmath156 ) at the tevatron , but it is not uncommon for effects of up to 40% to be quoted at the upper end ( @xmath157 ) of the @xmath73 reach of the lhc .    two kinds of issues need to be addressed .",
    "firstly there are effects that apply equally to inclusive and flavoured jet cross sections : it has been known for some time now @xcite that electroweak loop corrections for high-@xmath73 processes involve enhancements proportional to @xmath158 .",
    "such terms are analogous to sudakov double logarithms in qcd , with the difference that the masses at the electroweak scale regulate the infrared and collinear divergences . because of their double logarithmic structure",
    "they become large at high @xmath73 , and they are the main culprits in the 40% effects quoted in  @xcite at the high end of the lhc reach ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "a point emphasised there is that a phenomenological understanding of the impact of ew effects also requires that one consider the experimental treatment of real ew radiation .",
    "@xcite examined isolated @xmath122 and @xmath159 radiation and found that it compensated for about a quarter of the loop effects .",
    "however , the dominant real radiation contribution should come from ( soft ) collinear @xmath122 and @xmath159 emission , and it is to be expected that this will compensate a significant remaining part of the loop effects .",
    "a second issue arises specifically when considering flavoured jets , because by isolating a given flavour one breaks the electroweak su(2 ) symmetry : while the emission of a soft @xmath122 boson has little effect on the energy of the jet and so should largely cancel with corresponding virtual corrections in the inclusive jet spectrum , if the @xmath122 is emitted from a @xmath1-jet , it will convert it into a top - quark jet  @xcite .",
    "this is often referred to as bloch - nordsieck violation  @xcite and may lead to significant double logarithmic ew corrections for the very highest @xmath73 flavoured jets at the lhc . as for inclusive jet analyses ,",
    "the details of the experimental treatment are likely to be crucial , since the flavour attributed to the jet will depend on whether the top quark is reconstructed or whether it is only the @xmath1-hadron from the @xmath160 decay that is identified . for charm jets",
    "the experimental situation will be different insofar as the real ew emission process is @xmath161 , and strange hadrons do not decay back to charmed hadrons ! the question of flavour - changing ew effects is relevant also for the gluon splitting process , e.g.  @xmath162 , where one of the charm quarks may then emit a @xmath122 , giving a jet with a net charm flavour . if the @xmath122 is not identifiable experimentally , then at high @xmath73 at lhc this process , which has enhancements of the form @xmath163 , may give a non - negligible contribution to the charm - jet spectrum .",
