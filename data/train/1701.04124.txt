    "finite size effects in the resistivity of metallic thin films or nanowires have been a topic of research for several decades both from a fundamental as well as an applied point of view .",
    "while the resistivity of bulk metals is dominated by phonon ( and possibly impurity ) scattering at room temperature , surface scattering can become dominant when the size of the thin films or nanowires is reduced @xcite .",
    "in addition , grain sizes ( _ i.e. _ mean linear distances between grain boundaries ) in polycrystalline films or wires have typically been found to decrease for decreasing film thickness or wire diameter , which leads to an increasing contribution of grain boundary scattering in thin films or nanowires @xcite .",
    "ultimately , when the structure size becomes comparable to the fermi wavelength of the metal , electron confinement effects will also alter the resistivity of metallic nanostructures @xcite . while this behavior is universally found in all metals ,",
    "there is still controversy over the relative importance of the different additional scattering contributions even for the most studied material , cu @xcite , and only few comparative studies for different metals have been reported @xcite .    from an applied point of view",
    ", the understanding of the resistivity of metals in small dimensions is crucial since metallic nanowires form the interconnect structures that are used in integrated microelectronic circuits . at present , the widths of scaled interconnect wires are of the order of 25 to 30 nm and are expected to reach dimensions of about 10 nm in the next decade . at such dimensions , surface and grain boundary scattering in cu , the standard conductor material presently used in interconnects , dominate over phonon scattering , resulting in resistivities much larger than in the bulk @xcite and leading to a deterioration of the interconnect properties @xcite . in addition , cu - based interconnects require diffusion barriers and adhesion liners to ensure their reliability . since their resistivity is typically much larger than that of cu , they contribute negligibly to the wire conductance .",
    "barriers and liners are difficult to scale and will occupy a significant volume when the interconnect width approaches 10 nm , reducing the volume available for cu . therefore , alternative metals have recently elicited much interest that could serve as a barrierless replacement for cu . among them , p -group metals have emerged as promising candidates due to the combination of low bulk resistivity , resistance to oxidation , and high melting point , which can be considered as a proxy for resistance to electromigration @xcite .",
    "the main quest for alternatives to cu is motivated by the observation that the resistivity increase for thin films due to surface or grain boundary scattering approximately scales with @xmath1 . here",
    ", @xmath2 is the intrinsic mean free path ( mfp ) of the charge carriers in the bulk metal and the characteristic length scale @xmath3 is the film thickness for surface scattering or the average linear distance between grain boudaries for grain boundary scattering @xcite .",
    "hence , metals with short mfps should be less sensitive to surface or grain boundary scattering for a given @xmath3 . as a result",
    ", such metals may show lower resistivities than cu for sufficiently small dimensions despite their larger bulk resistivity @xcite .",
    "in addition , quantum effects for very small @xmath3 may also lead to such a behavior @xcite .",
    "however , such a crossover behavior has been elusive so far despite its strong interest for interconnect metallization .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the thickness dependence of the resistivity of pt group metal ( ru , pd , ir , pt ) ultrathin films with thicknesses between 3 and 30 nm .",
    "we demonstrate that their resistivity exhibits a much weaker thickness dependence than that of cu films in the same thickness range . as a result , for films thinner than about 5 nm",
    ", the resistivities of ru and ir films fall below that of cu .",
    "the thickness dependence of the resistivity of ru and ir is modeled using the analytical semiclassical mayadas ",
    "shatzkes approach and we demonstrate that the shorter mfp of pt group metals is indeed predominantly responsible for the resistivity crossover with respect to cu .",
    "the data indicate that ru , and ir are promising metals for future interconnects in advanced technology nodes with interconnect widths below 10 nm @xcite .",
    "all films were deposited by physical vapor deposition ( pvd ) at room temperature on si ( 100 ) . prior to metal deposition , a sufficiently thick ( 90 nm ) thermal oxide was grown on the si wafers to ensure electrical isolation .",
    "cu , ru , and ir films were deposited on 300 mm wafers in a canon anelva ec7800 system .",
    "in addition to films directly deposited on sio@xmath0 , cu and ru films were also grown _ in situ _ on 1.5 nm thick pvd tan and capped by 1.5 nm thick pvd tan .",
    "this was done to prevent the oxidation of the cu surface and to study the effect of the `` cladding '' material on the ru thin film resistivity .",
    "pt films were sputter deposited on small samples in a home build system using thin ( @xmath4 nm ) ti to promote adhesion .",
    "pd films were obtained by e - beam evaporation using a pfeiffer pls 580 system on a thin tin adhesion layer .",
    "the thin films resistivity was calculated from sheet resistance measurements using kla tencor rs100 and jandel 4-point probe systems as well as the film thickness measured by x - ray reflectivity ( xrr ) .",
    "xrr was performed using cu k@xmath5 radiation in a bede metrixl diffractometer from jordan valley and a panalytical xpert diffractometer .",
    "films thicknesses by xrr were cross - calibrated by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) measurements using a 1.52 mev he@xmath6 ion beam in a rotating random mode at a backscatter angle of 170@xmath7 . in all cases , the contribution of the adhesion layers to the sheet resistance was obtained by independent measurements and taken into account in the determination of the thin film resistivity of the metals of interest .",
    "the above diffractometers were also used to assess the film crystallinity using x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) .",
    "surface roughnesses were measured by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) using a bruker iconpt microscope .",
    "lateral correlation lengths of the surface roughness were obtained from the autocorrelation function .",
    "the microstructure of the films was determined from plan - view transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) images using tecnai f30 and titan3 g2 microscopes .",
    "based on these images , the mean linear grain boundary intercept distance ( the average linear distance between grain boundaries ) was determined @xcite . due to the rather columnar nature of the microstructure and their expected relatively weak contribution to the resistivity , grain boundaries parallel to the surface were neglected .",
    "electronic structures of the pt - group metals , ru , rh , pd , os , ir , and pt , as well as of cu were obtained by first - principles calculations based on density functional theory as implemented in the quantum espresso package @xcite .",
    "projector augmented wave @xcite potentials with the perdew  burke ",
    "ernzerhof generalized gradient @xcite approximation of the exchange - correlation functional have been used together with a @xmath8 monkhorst - pack * k*-point sampling grid and an energy cutoff of 80ry to ensure the convergence of the total energy differences ( 10  12ev ) .",
    "the fermi surface @xmath9 was determined from the calculated electron energy as a function of the wave vector * k * for each band with index @xmath10 .",

    "post deposition annealing at 420@xmath7c in forming gas for 20min increased both the crystallinity and led to strong texturing [ fig  [ xrd](a ) ] .",
    "the out - of - plane scherrer crystallite size of annealed films [ fig  [ xrd](b ) ] was typically of the order of the film thickness for films up to about 15 nm and deviated slightly towards smaller values for thicker films .",

    "the roughness of the annealed films increased with increasing film thickness but remained below 0.4 nm even for 30 nm thick pt - group metal .",
    "cu films were slightly rougher with rms values of 0.5 to 0.6 nm for the thickest films .",
    "xrr measurements ( not shown ) indicated that the roughness of the top surface was very similar to that of buried interfaces ( typically also 0.3 to 0.5 nm ) .",
    "the lateral correlation length @xmath12 of the surface roughness ( obtained with gaussian correlation statistics ) was between 10 and 15 nm for all films with insignificant differences between materials / stacks and only little coarsening in the studied thickness range up to 30 nm .",
    "figure [ tf_res ] shows the thin film resistivity of cu ( tan / cu / tan ) , ru ( ru / sio@xmath0 and tan / ru / tan ) , pd , ir , and pt as a function of the film thickness .",
    "all films have been annealed at 420@xmath7c for 20min in forming gas .",
    "cu shows a strong increase with decreasing film thickness , as observed previously and ascribed to the combination of surface and grain boundary scattering .",
    "note that the cu resistivity values are close to the ones reported in the literature for scaled cu interconnect lines of the same critical dimension @xcite .",
    "by contrast , all pt group thin films showed a much weaker thickness dependence than cu . for films with thicknesses @xmath13 nm",
    ", the resistivities were much higher than for cu owing to the higher bulk resistivities of pt - group metals .",
    "however , for film thicknesses of about 5 nm and below , the resistivities of ru and ir became comparable and even lower than the resistivity of cu . from a technological point of view , this resistivity crossover renders pt group metals , in particular ru and ir highly interesting for scaled interconnects with critical dimensions of 10 nm and below , where the current combination of cu , diffusion barriers , and adhesion liner layers may be outperformed by barrierless ru or ir metallization .",
    "indeed , scaled ru filled interconnect structures have already shown first promising results @xcite demonstrating the prospects of these materials for future interconnect technology nodes .    from a more fundamental point of view",
    ", these data raise the question of the material dependence of the thin film scattering contributions , such as surface and grain boundary scattering .",
    "it has been asserted that a shorter electron mfp will lead to a weaker thickness dependence of both surface and grain boundary scattering @xcite . however , to confirm this argument , effects of potentially different microstructures ( _ e.g. _ the thickness dependence of the mean linear distance between grain boundaries ) have to be understood , as have to be the relative contributions of surface and grain boundary scattering .",
    "in a first step , we have computed the electron mfps of the pt - group metals as well as of cu .",
    "the mfp in transport direction *",
    "t * of an electron with wave vector * k * is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the relaxation time of an electron with wave vector * k * and @xmath16 is the projection of the fermi velocity @xmath17 on the transport direction . here , @xmath18 is the fermi energy of the band with index @xmath10 .    in a semiclassical approximation ,",
    "the conductivity along the transport direction * t * can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the ( fermi ) distribution function , and @xmath21 has the dimension of an energy .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath23 , one obtains @xcite    @xmath24    here , the integration is carried out over the fermi surface .",
    "hence , the product of the relaxation time and the bulk resistivity depends only on the morphology of the fermi surface .",
    "when the bulk resistivity is known , @xmath25 can be deduced and thus the mfp in the transport direction , @xmath26 . for polycrystalline materials",
    ", suitable averages can be obtained from the isotropic @xmath25 in combination with an average of @xmath27 over the relevant transport directions .",
    "using _ ab initio _ calculated fermi surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ fermi ] ) , @xmath28 has been calculated for all pt - group metals as well as for cu as a reference . based on these values and experimental bulk resistivities @xmath29 @xcite , relaxation times @xmath30 have been deduced . in addition , relaxation times @xmath31 due to electron ",
    "phonon scattering have been directly calculated @xcite . since",
    "all films were polycrystalline and textured , an effective fermi velocity @xmath32 was obtained by averaging @xmath27 over transport directions perpendicular to [ 001 ] for the hcp metals ( ru , os ) and [ 111 ] for the fcc metals ( rh , pd , ir , pt , and cu ) .",
    "mfp values @xmath33 and @xmath34 have then been calculated using @xmath31 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the results are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab_ab_initio ] .",
    "note that the resistivity of hcp ru and os is anisotropic with the higher resistivity perpendicular to [ 001 ] @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ along the transport direction of our textured films .",
    "the values are generally in good agreement with a previous report @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , metals with short mfps may be less sensitive to surface or grain boundary scattering and thus may show a weaker thickness dependence of the resistivity than cu @xcite . as indicated in tab .",
    "[ tab_ab_initio ] , pt - group metals all show significantly shorter mfp than cu .",
    "since the thin film resistivity for a given thickness or linear grain boundary distance will also depend on the bulk resistivity , @xmath35 has been used as a figure of merit of a metal for the expected resistivity scaling at small dimensions @xcite . as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab_ab_initio ] , all pt - group metals show higher figures of merit than cu with pt showing the highest value .",
    "however , due to a comparatively high bulk resistivity , pt ( as well as pd and os ) may show benefits only for very small thicknesses or short linear grain boundary distances and thus rh , ir , and ru appear the most promising materials for films thicknesses of the order of 10 nm , relevant for future interconnects .",
    "to gain further insight into the contributions of surface and grain boundary scattering , the resistivity of ru , ir and cu was modeled using the semiclassical model developed by mayadas and shatzkes @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the resistivity of a thin film with thickness @xmath36 and average linear distance between grain boundaries ( average linear intercept length @xcite ) @xmath37 is given by    @xmath38 ^{-1 } \\equiv \\left[\\frac{1}{\\rho_\\mathrm{gb } } - \\frac{1}{\\rho_\\mathrm{ss , gb}}\\right ] ^{-1 } , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    with @xmath39^{-1}$ ] , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 @xcite . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are parameters that describe the surface and grain boundary scattering processes , respectively .",
    "the phenomenological surface specularity parameter @xmath43 varies between 0 for diffuse and 1 for specular scattering of charge carriers at the surface or interface ; @xmath44 is the reflection coefficient ( @xmath45 ) of a charge carrier at a grain boundary . in general",
    ", @xmath43 can take different values at the top and bottom interface , _",
    "e.g. _ when the surface and interface roughnesses are strongly different , as described by the model of soffer @xcite .",
    "however , given the observation that surface and buried interface roughnesses in the stacks considered here are low and highly similar , we will assume that a single parameter @xmath43 can describe both interfaces of the metal films .",
    "while surface scattering depends directly on the film thickness , grain boundary scattering depends on the ( average ) linear distance between grain boundaries , @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , a quantitative model of the thin film resistivity as a function of film thickness requires the knowledge of the thickness dependence of @xmath37 in polycrystalline films . historically , it has often been assumed that @xmath37 is identical or proportional to the film thickness and this assumption has often been used to model the thickness dependence of the resistivity .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that such simple relations are generally not valid @xcite .",
    "we have therefore experimentally determined the average linear grain boundary distance using the intercept method @xcite from plan view transmission micrographs for 5 , 10 , and 30 nm thick ru / sio@xmath0 ( as deposited and after annealing at 420@xmath7c ) , tan / ru / tan ( annealed ) , ir / sio@xmath0 ( annealed ) , and tan / cu / tan ( annealed ) thin films . figure  [ grain_size ] shows both sample tem images as well as the deduced film thickness dependence of the mean linear grain boundary intercept length . while for tan / cu / tan and annealed ru / sio@xmath0 the mean linear intercept length was close to the film thickness , other stacks clearly show a saturating effect for @xmath46 nm thick films .",
    "linear intercept lengths for in - between thicknesses were obtained by piecewise linear interpolation .",
    "other more nonlinear interpolation schemes did not have any strong effect on the modeling results discussed below .",
    "figure [ fits ] shows the experimental thickness dependence of the resistivities of ru / sio@xmath0 , tan / ru / tan , ir / sio@xmath0 , and tan / cu / tan , together with the best fits using the model in eq .",
    "( [ mss ] ) .",
    "all films were annealed at 420@xmath7c for 20min except for an additional data set of as deposited ru / sio@xmath0 . to obtain best fits , the experimentally determined thickness dependences of the linear distance between grain boundaries for the different materials and stacks , as discussed in the previous section , were used . in addition ,",
    "electron mfps obtained by _ ab initio _ calculations , @xmath33 ( see tab .",
    "[ tab_ab_initio ] ) , were employed in combination with experimental bulk resistivities . for ru ,",
    "the bulk resistivity has been reported to be anisotropic @xcite . since all films studied here showed strong ( 001 ) texture ,",
    "the bulk in - plane resistivity ( perpendicular to the hexagonal axis ) has been used . only @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "were used as adjustable parameters . in general , the model described well the thickness dependence of the thin film resistivity for all materials and stacks over the entire thickness range .",
    "the resulting parameters are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] .    the results for cu films ( within a tan / cu / tan stack ) show that both surface ( @xmath47 ) and grain boundary scattering ( @xmath48 ) contribute to the thin film resistivity .",
    "the values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 fall well within the range of published values @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are in good agreement with a recent review @xcite that concluded that the scattering at tan / cu interfaces is highly diffuse , in agreement with our results .    by contrast ,",
    "grain boundary reflection coefficients for ru and ir were larger than for cu with @xmath49 to 0.58 for the different ru stacks and @xmath50 for ir / sio@xmath0 .",
    "although grain boundary configurations , in particular the average misorientation angle of contiguous grains , can have an influence on the grain boundary resistance , as discussed below , a simple model of the material dependence of @xmath44 for polycrystalline films has been proposed by relating @xmath44 to the surface energy ( and to the melting point ) of the material @xcite .",
    "this is fully consistent with our observations that @xmath44 is larger for the more refractory ru and ir than for cu .",
    "moreover , our experimentally obtained values of @xmath51 for ru and @xmath50 for ir are in reasonable quantitative agreement with the predictions of this model of @xmath52 for ru and @xmath53 for ir @xcite .",
    "note that the predicted value for cu is @xmath54 , also in reasonable agreement with our results .",
    "the grain boundary coefficients of ru / sio@xmath0 showed a reduction upon annealing ( @xmath49 _ vs. _ @xmath55 ) .",
    "this can be attributed to a reduction of the average misorientation of adjacent grains , as typically observed during recrystallization processes due to the preferred movement of large - angle grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "it has been both calculated @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite for cu that the resistance of boundaries between randomly oriented grains is much larger than that of coherent or coincidence grain boundaries .",
    "we speculate that a similar behavior also applies to ru grain boundaries , leading to the observed reduction of @xmath44 upon annealing .",
    "the intermediate value for the tan / ru / tan stack is also in qualitative agreement with this argument since the observed small grain size even after annealing may be correlated with larger grain boundary resistances than for annealed large grain ru on sio@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , both ru and ir on sio@xmath0 showed nearly specular surface scattering with @xmath56 . hence , in those films , despite their small thicknesses , surface scattering does not appear contribute strongly to the resistivity .",
    "it has been calculated that the surface scattering coefficient for a given interface should be a strong function of both the magnitude ( rms ) as well as its lateral correlation length of the surface roughness @xcite .",
    "although the ru / sio@xmath0 and ir / sio@xmath0 films are somewhat smoother than the tan / cu / tan films ( fig .",
    "[ afm ] ) , the difference is small and the lateral correlations lengths are similar .",
    "therefore , it appears unlikely that the difference between ru / sio@xmath0 as well as ir / sio@xmath0 and tan / cu / tan is only due to differences in the physical surface properties .",
    "thus , the electronic structure and the scattering potentials at the interface may contribute significantly @xcite .    moreover , strongly diffuse scattering was observed at ru / tan interfaces ( as in tan / ru / tan stacks ) with @xmath57 .",
    "this indicates that surface scattering appears to depend less on the conducting metal ( ru _ vs. _ cu ) than on the cladding material of the thin film ( sio@xmath0/air _ vs. _ tan ) .",
    "note that surface roughnesses for tan / ru / tan and ru / sio@xmath0 were almost identical .",
    "similar observations have been made for cu @xcite .",
    "in particular , rossnagel and kuan @xcite have observed that the surface scattering contribution to the thin film resistivity was lower in contact with oxides ( sio@xmath0 , ta@xmath0o@xmath58 ) than with tan , very similar to our observations .",
    "several models for the surface specularity parameter @xmath43 have been reported in the literature @xcite that quantitatively link @xmath43 to the surface roughness and the intrinsic properties of the fermi surface of the conducting material .",
    "however , only very few studies have considered the effect of the cladding material @xcite , which appears essential in view of the experimental results .",
    "_ @xcite have studied the resistivity of cu films surrounded by different metals using _ ab initio _ calculations and found that metals can both lower as well as increase @xmath43 with respect to a free cu surface , depending on the difference of the density of states at the fermi level of conducting metal ( cu ) and the cladding atom at the interface .",
    "although the density of states at the ru / tan interface has not yet been calculated , the bulk densities of states of ru and tan at the respective fermi levels are rather similar .",
    "additional work is thus needed to clarify the contributions of the properties of the conductor and the cladding material and its interface on the surface scattering parameter .",
    "equation ( [ mss ] ) does not fulfill matthiessen s rule and the contributions of grain boundary and surface scattering can therefore not be completely separated .",
    "while the first term in eq .",
    "( [ mss ] ) , @xmath59 , describes grain boundary scattering independently of surface scattering , the second term , @xmath60 describes combined effects of surface and grain boundary scattering .",
    "nonetheless , the ratio of the two terms can be evaluated and allows to shed some light on the relative important of grain boundary and surface scattering .",
    "figure  [ sigmas ] shows the ratio of @xmath61 and @xmath62 as a function of the surface scattering parameter @xmath43 for tan / cu / tan , ru / sio@xmath0 , tan / ru / tan , as well as ir / sio@xmath0 and film thicknesses of 5 nm [ fig .",

    "( [ mss ] ) , a ratio of @xmath63 corresponds to equal contributions of the two terms , whereas surface scattering dominates for larger values and grain boundary scattering for smaller values .",
    "the data indicate a general prevalence of grain boundary scattering over surface scattering for all stacks even for the most diffusive case of @xmath64 since generally @xmath65 . only for tan / cu / tan ( in particular for 5 nm film thickness )",
    ", @xmath66 contributed strongly to the overall conductivity .",
    "by contrast , the contributions were weak for pt - group metal stacks  even for fully diffusive surface scattering , as observed for tan / ru / tan .",
    "the different magnitudes of @xmath59 and @xmath67 have strong repercussions on the accuracy of the extracted @xmath43 and @xmath44 values .",

    "in general , due to the small contribution of @xmath66 , sse minima were rather elongated along the @xmath43-axis and well defined along the @xmath44-axis . generally , a rather weak gradient was visible along the elongated sse minima towards the values reported in tab .",
    "this resulted in much larger error bars ( by about @xmath68 ) of @xmath43 as compared to @xmath44 .",
    "correlations between @xmath43 and @xmath44 were also visible that increase the otherwise very small errors in @xmath44 .",
    "this shows that the surface scattering specularity parameter of pt - group metals can therefore only approximately be determined by modeling of the thickness dependence of the resistivity , at least for the film thicknesses and grain sizes considered here .",
    "however , the discussion above unambiguously shows that the effect of surface scattering on the ru and ir resistivity is weak , much weaker than for cu , due to the much smaller mfp and that this held rather independently of the exact value of the determined value for @xmath43 .",
    "this also indicates that the absolute value of @xmath43 should not necessarily be taken as a measure whether surface scattering contributes significantly or not .",
    "by contrast , the contribution of surface scattering was much larger for tan / cu / tan ( fig .",
    "[ sigmas ] ) .",
    "this can be linked to the long mfp of 40.6 nm .",

    "the data show that an increase of @xmath5 ( _ i.e. _ stronger grain boundary scattering ) leads to an decrease in @xmath66 that is generally faster than for @xmath62 .",

    "however , the scattering at ru / sio@xmath0 and ru / air interfaces was found to be nearly specular and the contribution of surface scattering to the thin film resistivity was also negligible for ru / sio@xmath0 .",

    "it has been previously proposed that metals with a shorter mfp may show a much weaker thickness dependence of their thin film resistivity . however , this effect may potentially be complemented or domineered by other factors such as the material ( stack ) dependence of surface and grain boundary scattering coefficients as well as the thickness dependence of the linear intercept between grain boundaries , which will in generally depend both on the material and the applied thermal budget .    to gain further insight in the importance of the electron mfp",

    "the larger deviations for the 3 nm thick films in both graphs can be ascribed to the much stronger contribution of surface scattering to the cu resistivity , which becomes significant only for such small thicknesses . as a whole",
    ", however , this confirms that the shorter mfp is the main root cause for the different thickness dependence of the resistivity of cu and the pt - group metals .",

    "grain boundary scattering coefficients for ru and ir ( @xmath80 to 0.5 ) were significantly higher than for cu ( @xmath48 ) , in good qualitative agreement with a recent prediction @xcite .",
    "nearly specular scattering ( @xmath56 ) was observed for both ru and ir on sio@xmath0 but the interface scattering was much more diffuse ( @xmath81 ) for tan / ru / tan indicating that specular surface scattering is not an intrinsic material property of ru .",
    "this behavior is currently not yet well understood owing to the lack of a general theory for the material dependence of interface scattering .",
    "however , it should be noted that in all cases  irrespective of @xmath43surface scattering contributed only weakly to the overall resistivity , which was dominated by grain boundary scattering , except for the thinnest tan / cu / tan films .",
    "simulations showed that the much shorter mfp of ru and ir was indeed responsible for the much weaker thickness dependence of the thin film resistivity .",
    "this confirms earlier predictions @xcite and justifies the usage of @xmath35 as a figure of merit of alternative metals for beyond - cu interconnects @xcite , in particular with respect to the the expected scaling behavior .",
