    "natural units @xmath33 are used all over this paper .",
    "although dark matter was noticed seventy - five years ago @xcite , its nature is not yet known .",
    "dark matter ( dm ) is needed to explain the observed structures in the universe , in particular galaxies .",
    "dm particles must have been non - relativistic by the time of structure formation in order to reproduce the observed small structure at @xmath34 kpc .",
    "the connection between the scale of the formed structure and the mass of the dm particle follows from the value of the free - streaming length @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this is the distance that the dm particles can freely travel .",
    "structures at scales smaller than @xmath35 are erased by free - streaming and hence @xmath35 provides a lower bound on the size of dm dominated structures .",

    "a @xmath38 kpc is in nice agreement with the astronomical observations of galaxies @xcite ( smaller objects like stars are made up of baryons , not of dm ) , as well as at cosmological scales .",

    "this is why hdm has been ruled out @xcite .",
    "the reason why cdm does not work is simple : cdm particles in the gev scale are too slow ( too cold ) , which prevents them to erase the small scale structure , while the ev particles ( hdm ) are excessively fast , which erases all structures . in between , wdm kev particles are able to produce the observed structures .",
    "astronomical observations strongly indicate that dark matter halos have cored profiles till scales below 1 kpc . on the contrary , cdm simulations ( particles heavier than 1 gev )",

    "constraints of the dm particle mass to the kev range are obtained from combining theoretical analyses with the observed values of dark matter densities and phase space densities today ( density over the cube of the velocity dispersion ) of dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "recent radioastronomy observations of velocity widths in galaxies from 21 cm hi surveys clearly favours wdm over cdm @xcite .",
    "wdm simulations contrasted to astronomical observations suggest a wdm particle mass slightly above 1 kev .",
    "constraints from large scale structure give this value too @xcite .",
    "recent cosmological wdm n - body simulations with kev sterile neutrino wdm clearly show the agreement of the predicted small scale structures with the observations , while cdm simulations do not agree with observations at such scales @xcite .    none of the predictions of cdm simulations at small scales ( cusps , substructures , dark disks , ... ) have been observed . here",
    "are some examples . the cdm satellite problem , namely that cdm simulations predict too many satellites in the milky way and only 1/3 of satellites predicted by cdm simulations around our galaxy are observed . the surface density problem , which consists of the galaxy surface density for cdm simulations being 1000 larger than observed @xcite . and the voids problem and the size problem , that have to do with the fact that cdm simulations do not produce big enough galaxies @xcite .",
    "further wdm properties are discussed in @xcite .",
    "notice that all dm observable effects discussed above only arise from the gravitational behaviour of the dm .",
    "galaxy properties are independent of the non - gravitational couplings of the dm particles , provided that their couplings are small enough .",
    "dm may decouple at or out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the distribution function freezes out at decoupling . whether they decouple at or out of equilibrium depends on the non - gravitational couplings of the dm particle . normally , sterile neutrinos are so weakly coupled that they decouple out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the functional form of the dm distribution function depends on the dm particle couplings and is therefore model dependent .",
    "sterile neutrinos can decay into an active - like neutrino and a monochromatic x - ray photon with an energy half the mass of the sterile neutrino . observing the x - ray photon",
    "provides a way to observe sterile neutrinos in dm halos @xcite .",
    "wdm kev sterile neutrinos can be copiously produced in the supernovae cores .",
    "supernovae ( sn ) stringently constrain the neutrino mixing angle squared to be @xmath46 for @xmath47 kev , in order to avoid excessive energy lost . however , for smaller masses the sn bound is not so direct .",
    "within the models worked out till now , mixing angles are essentially unconstrained by sn in the kev mass range @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos are produced out of thermal equilibrium and their production can be non - resonant , in the absence of lepton asymmetries , or resonantly enhanced , if lepton asymmetries are present .",
    "kev sterile neutrino wdm in minimal extensions of the standard model is consistent with lyman - alpha constraints within a wide range of the model parameters .",
    "lyman - alpha observations give a lower bound for the sterile neutrino mass of 4 kev only for sterile neutrinos produced in the case of a non - resonant ( dodelson - widrow ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "the lyman - alpha lower bounds for the wdm particle mass are smaller in the neutrino minimal standard model , where sterile neutrinos are produced by the decay of a heavy neutral scalar , and for fermions in thermal equilibrium . moreover",
    ", the number of observed milky - way satellites indicates lower bounds between 2 and 13 kev for different models of sterile neutrinos .    in summary ,",
    "contrary to cdm , wdm essentially _ works _ , reproducing in a natural way the astronomical observations of structures over all scales , small as well as large and cosmological scales .",
    "the sterile neutrino with mass in the kev scale appears as a serious candidate for wdm .",
    "galaxy observations alone can not determine the dm particle properties other than the mass and the decoupling temperature .",
    "a direct particle detection is necessary to pinpoint and determine which particle candidate describes dm .",
    "beta decay is a promising way to detect dm sterile neutrinos .",
    "as it is known , dm is not described by the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",

    "neutrinos one can advance that there are both left- and right- handed quarks ( with respect to chirality ) while active neutrinos are only left - handed .",

    "tritium beta decay would allow the detection of sterile neutrinos heavier than in the rhenium beta decay case , within the 1 to 10 kev range suggested by cosmological and galactic observations .",

    "the detection of sterile neutrinos is not only important from the point of view of particle physics for the extension of the sm , but also from the point of view of cosmology and astrophysics as a serious candidate for dark matter in the kev mass range . with the relevance of the possible detection of kev scale dark matter candidates in mind , we have studied rhenium 187 and",
    "tritium beta decays .",
    "the low electron energy domain of the beta spectrum is the region where a sterile neutrino could be detected and its mass measured , the expected mass being in the kev scale ( 1 to 10 kev ) as constrained from cosmological and galactic observations and theoretical analysis .",
    "the electron low energy region that is suitable to detect the sterile neutrino , @xmath268 , is away from the endpoint energy region suitable for the detection of the active neutrino mass .",
    "two experiments are running at present , mare and katrin , dealing with rhenium 187 and tritium beta decays respectively .",
    "the mare experiment will provide the entire shape of the electron differential decay rate , giving data for both the sterile and the active neutrino detection regions .",
    "katrin so far concentrates on the region near the endpoint of the electron spectrum but it would be extremely interesting to look for data in the region where kev sterile neutrinos could show up @xcite . in this paper , we have carried out the study of the role of sterile neutrinos in beta decay spectra , within the expected kev mass range and considering different mixing angles , according to astronomical and cosmological observations and experiments .    for @xmath74re the electrons can be emitted in @xmath27-wave and in @xmath26-wave , the former dominating the decay by a factor @xmath269 over the latter . for tritium",
    "the electrons are emitted in @xmath26-wave only .",
    "the spectra of the electrons emitted in these waves have been carefully computed from the experimental beta decay half - lives using relativistic fermi functions .",
    "results for different neutrino masses ( light and in the 1 - 2 kev range ) have been obtained separately and mixed .",
    "we have also computed for both decays the ratio @xmath3 of the light to the heavy component of the mixing .",
    "it is different from zero in an electron momentum range @xmath270 , where @xmath271 decreases with increasing sterile neutrino mass @xmath1 ( equivalently for electron kinetic energy range ) . in the vicinity of @xmath271",
    "the ratio @xmath3 drops off sharply , but in the rest of the range it exhibits an almost constant plateau with a slight increase as @xmath184 goes to zero .",
    "it increases with the mixing angle and decreases with the sterile neutrino mass @xmath1 .    in order to detect the small deviation in the experimental spectrum due to the sterile neutrino mixing , the relative experimental random error ( inversely proportional to the square root of the number of measured events , @xmath272 ) must be as small as possible . to this end , the number of detected events @xmath273 must increase by choosing , for instance , a beta decay with a small @xmath122 value or by increasing the time of data acquisition . for mare , the typical number of events is @xmath274 for 10 years of data acquisition , 8 arrays and 400 gr of natural rhenium @xcite .",
    "we found that at its largest value , the ratio @xmath275 of the sterile neutrino to the active neutrino contributions is about @xmath276 using a realistic mixing angle .",
    "therefore the sterile neutrino probability @xmath277 is about @xmath278 , which is not negligible .",
    "it implies finding @xmath278 sterile neutrinos within @xmath279 events .",
    "these numbers increase one order of magnitude for the mare option of @xmath280 events for 10 years of data acquisition , 16 arrays and 3.2 kg of natural rhenium @xcite .",
    "a simple estimate requires the poisson error @xmath281 to be smaller than the ratio @xmath275 .",
    "namely , @xmath282 . of course ,",
    "in order to assess a precise prediction of the detection probability one should include a careful analysis of the systematic errors and instrument parameters , but such study goes beyond the scope of the present paper . the small effect expected on the electron spectrum",
    "calls for sources with larger stability to reduce the systematic errors , which pose at present a difficult challenge on the detection capabilities of these experiments . furthermore , for @xmath283 10@xmath284 there would be one sterile neutrino event for one hundred million active neutrino events .",
    "the main purpose of this paper has been to guide future experimental searches for sterile neutrinos . from the point of view of particle physics ,",
    "one is talking about an extension of the standard model . from the point of view of cosmology",
    ", one is looking for a kev candidate for dm ( mass range favoured by cosmological observations ) .",
    "therefore , we show in this paper the relevant energy range where experimentalists should focus on as well as the order of magnitude of the expected signal , both in absolute terms and with respect to the background .",
