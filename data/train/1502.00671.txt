    "the presence of unpaired electron spins in these systems allows one to influence and control these reactions using interactions between external magnetic fields and electron spins @xcite .",
    "however , until 1970 , most scientists believed that ordinary magnetic fields had no significant effect on chemical or biochemical reactions , since the magnetic energy of typical molecules , under ordinary magnetic fields , is much smaller than the thermal energy at room temperature and is much smaller than the activation energies for those reactions @xcite .",
    "this situation changed significantly in the 1970 s after a series of experimental results were reported on magnetic field effects on chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "because of these experimental studies , a number of researchers have made an effort to theoretically explain the magnetic field effects on the chemical reactions@xcite .",
    "thanks to these and the subsequent efforts , we are now able to explain systematically magnetic field effects in terms of the radical pair mechanism .",
    "the radical pair mechanism was then successfully applied to explain the chemically induced nuclear polarization and electron polarization , which were shown to be based on the spin dynamics of radical pairs @xcite .",
    "+   + according to the radical pair mechanism , an external magnetic field affects chemical reactions by alternating the electron spin state of a weakly coupled radical pair , which is produced as an intermediate .",
    "the basic scheme of chemical reactions through the radical pairs is shown in fig .",

    "radical pairs are usually produced as short - lived intermediates through decomposition , electron transfer , or hydrogen transfer reactions from singlet or triplet excited states .",

    "sometimes , recombination reactions occur from s- or t - close pairs immediately after the formation of the radical pairs .",
    "such reactions are called  primary recombinations \" , and their products are called  cage products \" . however , because of the pauli exclusion principle , the t - close pairs require enough energy to produce excited  cage products \" , while the s - close pairs are able to produce the ground state of the  cage products \" , due to the spin preservation during the chemical reactions . consequently , the recombination reactions from t - close pairs occur less frequently than those from s - close pairs .",
    "usually , we can ignore reactions from t - close pairs .",
    "however , the singlet - triplet conversion is possible for close pairs involving heavy atom - centered radicals due to their spin - orbit interactions .",
    "but for close pairs involving only light atom - centered radicals , no spin conversion occurs between their singlet and triplet states .",
    "the s - t conversion mainly occurs during the second stage . in the second stage , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rpsch ] , the two radicals begin to diffuse away from each other , forming a separate pair .",
    "when the two radicals are separated at a certain distance , the s - t conversion becomes possible through weak magnetic interactions of radicals including zeeman and the hyperfine interactions , as will be explained in detail later . in the last stage ,",
    "some of the separated radicals approach each other , forming close pairs again , and some continue to diffuse from each other , forming free radicals and producing  escape products \" with or without the solvent molecules @xcite .",
    "consider two weakly coupled radicals that form a radical pair .",
    "the spin dynamics of the radical pair is governed by a hamiltonian ( @xmath0 ) , which can be expressed as the sum of an exchange term ( @xmath1 ) and a magnetic ( @xmath2 ) term @xcite , @xmath3 where , @xmath4 @xmath5 in eq .",

    "the more viscous the solvent is , the longer the lifetime of the radical pair becomes .",
    "the magnetic field can have an influence on the products of chemical reactions through the radical pairs in solution @xcite . since the lifetime of a radical pair becomes longer in a more viscous solvent ,",
    "the magnetic field effects , due the radical pair mechanism , become appreciable if the solvent is very viscous @xcite .",
    "( [ st0 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ st1 ] ) clearly show that the @xmath57 conversion of a radical pair can be influenced by the external magnetic field and the hyperfine interaction , in the region where the exchange interaction ( @xmath9 ) can be neglected .",
    "thus , the magnetic field effects on radical pairs in this region can be classified by two typical mechanisms : the @xmath58 mechanism and the hyperfine coupling mechanism .",
    "the @xmath58 mechanism is appreciable when @xmath59 and @xmath60 , while the hyperfine coupling mechanism is appreciable when @xmath61 , and @xmath62 or @xmath63 @xcite .",

    "( [ st0 ] ) , in an external magnetic field , the @xmath45 conversion can be induced with a frequency of @xmath64 , but the @xmath65 conversion will still not occur .",
    "this means that , due to the @xmath58 mechanism , the rate of @xmath57 conversion becomes larger with a stronger external magnetic field .",
    "in this situation , if the radical pair in a chemical reaction is produced from an s - precursor , the cage product will decrease as the magnetic field increases .",
    "because a singlet radical pair is generated initially , the conversion rate will increase as the field increases .",
    "also , it can be proved that the magnetically induced decrease in the yield of the cage product is proportional to @xmath66 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the yield of products from the triplet radical pair , such as escape products , increases with @xmath67 increasing .",
    "the opposite results occur when the radical pair is generated from a t - precursor . the yield of cage product increases , with @xmath67 increasing at a rate proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "the yield of products from the triplet pair , such as escape products , decreases .",
    "+   + for the hyperfine coupling mechanism at zero magnetic field , the @xmath57 conversion can occur between the singlet state and all of the three sub - levels of the triplet state , through the hyperfine coupling terms in eq .",
    "( [ st0 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ st1 ] ) . in the presence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "the three triplet sub - levels are split by the zeeman effect .",
    "so the @xmath65 conversion will be forbidden due to the energy gap , but the @xmath68 conversion can occur with the same frequency , @xmath69 , as the frequency without the magnetic field . as a result ,",
    "the rate of the @xmath57 conversion decreases as the external magnetic field increases . and",
    "this decrease becomes saturated at higher fields . due to this mechanism ,",
    "if the radical pair is produced from the s - precursor , the yield of cage products will increase , and the yield of products produced from the triplet pair will decreases , when a non - zero magnetic field is present .",
    "the magnetically reduced triplet yield is characterized by the field , @xmath70 , at a half saturation .",
    "weller @xmath71 @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite gave an expression of the @xmath70 value as , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ; @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 ) .",
    "the opposite occurs for a pair generated from a t - precursor .",
    "the yield of cage product decreases with @xmath67 increasing at a rate proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "the yield of products produced from the triplet pair , such as escape products , increases with @xmath67 , and these magnetically induced changes should also become saturated at very high magnetic fields ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "+   + it is noteworthy that due to the @xmath58 mechanism and the hyperfine coupling mechanism , the external magnetic field has opposite effects on the product yields .",
    "the general case will be a mixture of these two mechanisms , meaning @xmath59 , and @xmath62 or @xmath63 . in this case",
    ", the magnetic field effects , due to the @xmath58 mechanism and the hyperfine coupling mechanism , appear simultaneously .",
    "since the magnetic field effects due to the hyperfine coupling mechanism have a saturated region , the magnetic field effects due to the @xmath58 mechanism dominate at high fields , and the magnetic field effects due to the hyperfine coupling mechanism dominate at low fields .",
    "therefore , the cage product yield has a maximum ( nadir ) , when the radical pair is generated from an s - precursor ( t - precursor ) as a function of increasing magnetic field .",
    "before the twentieth century , biology and physics rarely crossed paths .",
    "but after the development of quantum mechanics , schrdinger introduced quantum physics into the realm of biology @xcite",
    ". however , quantum mechanics normally applies at the microscopic regions of the order of nanometers , and living organisms belong to the macroscopic world .",
    "usually , quantum collective ( coherent ) effects can only be observed in laboratories using a high vacuum and/or an ultra - low temperature . despite these differences ,",
    "the progress in quantum biology has been very rapid since the twentieth century @xcite . in some sense ,",
    "the quantum mechanics always plays a significant role in biology since every chemical reaction relies on quantum mechanics , and chemical reactions are the basic processes in biological systems @xcite .",
    "recently , many articles have been published in the field of quantum biology , including articles on photosynthesis @xcite , avian compass @xcite , and olfaction @xcite .",
    "+   + the precise mechanism of avian navigation has been a mystery for centuries .",
    "every year migrant birds navigate hundreds or even thousands of miles between their seasonal habitats .",
    "scientists have been trying to explain this astonishing phenomenon for decades . to date",
    ", the primary biophysical process underlying the avian compass still remains unknown .",
    "scientists found that many sources of directional information can contribute to birds navigation , such as landmarks or topographic features @xcite , stars @xcite , the sun @xcite , and so on . among these sources and hypotheses ,",
    "magnetite as well as biochemical radical - pair reactions has been hypothesized to mediate sensitivity to earth - strength magnetic fields through fundamentally different physical mechanisms @xcite . in the magnetite - based mechanism ,",
    "magnetic fields exert mechanical forces @xcite .",
    "recently , treiber @xmath71 @xmath72 . reported that the iron minerals ( located in cells in the upper beak of pigeons , and possibly magnetite ) , are actually macrophages and have nothing to do with magnetic sensing @xcite , but the magnetite - based mechanism is still a reasonable hypothesis to explain the magnetoreception in birds . in the radical - pair mechanism ,",
    "magnetic fields alter the dynamics of transitions between spin states , after the creation of a radical pair through a light - induced electron transfer . these transitions in turn affect reaction rates and products @xcite .",
    "there are also two important properties of the avian compass that can be explained by radical pair mechanism very well .",
    "+   + first of all , the avian compass is an inclination compass rather than a polarity compass @xcite .",
    "the geomagnetic field lines leave the earth at the magnetic pole near the geographic south pole , curve around the earth and re - enter to the earth at the magnetic pole near the geographic north pole .",
    "the inclination , defined as the angle between the field lines and the horizontal plane , is @xmath81 at the magnetic poles and @xmath82 at the magnetic equator ; at the latter , the field lines run parallel to the earth s surface . in the northern hemisphere",
    ", field lines have a downward component with a positive inclination ; in the southern hemisphere they have an upward component .",
    "therefore , the geomagnetic field provides a reliable , omnipresent source of navigational information for birds capable of sensing the field .",
    "the functional mode of the avian magnetic compass is different from that of our standard compasses .",
    "the avian magnetic compass was found to be an inclination compass based on the inclination of the field lines instead of their polarity @xcite .",
    "birds can only perceive the axial course of the field lines and they must interpret the inclination of the field lines with respect to up and down to derive unambiguous directional information .",
    "the avian magnetic compass does not distinguish between magnetic `` north '' and  south \" as indicated by polarity .",
    "+   + a second important property of the avian compass is its light dependence .",
    "this property has been supported by a series of behavioral experiments @xcite .",
    "the avian compass orientation is dependent on the wavelength of the ambient light . while european robins and australian silvereyes demonstrated good orientation in blue light and green light , they were disoriented in red light @xcite . also , european robins can not orient in yellow - orange light , although there is a significant overlap between the green light , where orientation was excellent , and the yellow light without orientation @xcite .",
    "these experimental findings put constraints on any mechanism designed to explain magnetoreception in birds and provide very strong support for the radical pair mechanism @xcite .",
    "the actual reaction scheme of the magnetoreception can be very complex in birds .",
    "it involves molecules in the eyes absorbing the light , the chemical reaction of the radical pair in these molecules , and the avian neurons to react to the signal .",
    "however , we can simplify the scheme into three stages . +   + in the first stage , the photons with enough energy activate a certain type of molecules located in the birds eye , inducing an electron transfer reaction and generating the radical pairs in their excited singlet states .",
    "after the pair is generated , under the influence of the external magnetic field ( the geomagnetic field ) and the internal magnetic field ( the hyperfine coupling effect ) , the state of the pair can remain a singlet state or become a triplet state .",
    "a different inclination angles , associated with the external magnetic field , can induce different ratios of the singlet and triplet states . in the last stage ,",
    "the molecules in different states will generate different chemical products which can induce a detectable signal that the birds can use to recognize the direction they need to go @xcite .",
    "+   + the predictions of the radical - pair mechanism are consistent with behavioral findings : the reaction yield is independent of the polarity of the magnetic field @xcite , reception of magnetic information takes place in the eye @xcite , reception is strongly affected by the ambient light conditions @xcite , and reception is consistent with the postulated role of ocular photoreceptors in creating magnetosensitive radical pairs @xcite .",
    "+   + although there are not any observations of specific biological radical pairs satisfying all constraints , the current discussion of cryptochrome 1a ( cry1a ) makes it a promising candidate for magnetosensitive radical pair@xcite .",
    "also , the electron transfer path has been studied @xcite . however , the neural path is still unknown , although a vision - based hypothesis was put forward by ritz @xmath71 @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite .      using a carotenoid - porphyrin - fullerene model system @xcite , hore and his colleagues demonstrated that , under a static magnetic field , as weak as the geomagnetic field , a chemical reaction can act as a magnetic compass , by producing the detectable changes in the chemical product yield .",
    "their experiment has provided a proof - of - principle of a chemical compass .",
    "along with other experiments @xcite , this provides a significant support to the radical - pair hypothesis of the avian magnetic compass .",
    "+   + however , the candidate molecules with certain biophysical characteristics must exist in the eyes of the migratory birds , so that the radical pair mechanism can play a role in the magnetoreception .",
    "cryptochromes , a class of photoreceptor proteins located in the retina and absorbing blue - green part of the spectrum which is the functional range of the magnetic compass @xcite , were proposed as the host molecules for the crucial radical pair cofactors that putatively act as primary magnetoreceptors .",
    "also , the experiments have demonstrated that the vertebrate cryptochromes , under the uv / visible transient absorption and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy , form long - lived radical pairs which involve a flavin radical and a radical derived from a redox - active amino acid @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that the cryptochrome harbors are the type of radical pair needed for the action of the magnetic compass .",
    "scientists also have verified that cryptochromes exist in the eyes of the migratory birds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a distinct part of the forebrain , which primarily processes input from the eyes , is highly active at night in the night - migratory birds @xcite .",
    "all of these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the cryptochromes can serve as the primary magnetoreceptors .",
    "+   + the process of cryptochrome photoactivation has been discussed , and several reaction schemes have been proposed @xcite .",
    "cryptochrome contains a blue - light - absorbing chromophore , flavin adenine dinucleotide ( fad ) .",
    "this fad cofactor is reduced via a series of light - induced electron transfers , from a chain of three tryptophans ( trp ) that bridge the space between fad and the protein surface @xcite .",
    "+   + according to hore and his colleagues @xcite , due to the light - induced electron transfer , a radical pair [ fad@xmath83@xmath84trph@xmath83@xmath85 ( rp1 ) is formed in the cryptochrome ( cry-1 from the plant _ arabidopsis thaliana _ , _ _",
    "at__cry ) , followed by a second radical pair [ fadh@xmath83trp@xmath83 ] ( rp2 ) .",
    "the formation of rp2 is more complex .",
    "the tryptophanyl radical may deprotonate either fully or partially , while the protonation of fad@xmath83@xmath84 produces a the neutral fadh@xmath83 . in this scheme , the rp1 interconverts coherently between singlet and triplet states , under the influence of the magnetic interactions internal to the radicals ( electron - nuclear hyperfine couplings ) , and under the zeeman interactions with the external magnetic field . only the singlet state of rp1 can revert to the ground state [ fad+trph ] by the electron - hole recombination , and the corresponding reaction of the triplet state being spin - forbidden .",
    "simultaneously , one of the constituents of the rp1 changes its protonation state to give rp2 , a process that is not spin - related , and in which the singlet and triplet are produced at equal rates .      despite all of the theoretical arguments ,",
    "the ultimate goal of studying the mechanisms of bird navigation is to learn from nature and to design highly effective devices that can mimic biological systems in order to detect weak magnetic fields , and to use the geomagnetic field to navigate .",
    "previous literature has shown that the anisotropic hyperfine coupling plays a crucial role in the magnetic field sensitivity of the avian compass and has provided routes towards the design of biologically inspired magnetic compass sensors @xcite .",
    "scientists have exploited many practical methods to realize a device based on the avian chemical compass .",
    "recently , several intriguing models were reported , and significant experimental / simulative results were obtained .",
    "+   + one of the models is a synthetic donor - bridge - acceptor compass , which is a triad composed of linked carotenoid ( c ) , porphyrin ( p ) and fullerene ( f ) groups @xcite .",
    "such a triad molecule is the first known molecule that has been experimentally demonstrated to be sensitive to the geomagnetic field , although it works at low temperature ( 193k ) .",
    "in such a molecule , both radicals are immobilized .",
    "the anisotropic magnetic interactions are preserved because the hyperfine interactions in the fullerence radical are very small , and the anisotropic interaction in the carotenoid radical dominates the anisotropy of magnetic field effect .",
    "the other conditions are that the radical pair is generated in the singlet state with different decay rates for singlet and triplet states ( @xmath87 ) , and the rate of the spin - lattice relaxation is comparable to the combination rate .",
    "based on all such conditions , the experiments showed a promising result under a magnetic field of the order of @xmath88mt and produced the surprising result that the lifetime of the radical pair is significantly affected by magnetic fields as weak as 50 @xmath89 t , which is about the magnitude of the geomagnetic field@xcite . yet , the fact is that currently there is not a biomimetic or synthetic chemical compass that functions at room temperature .",
    "+   + another model is one utilizing magnetic nanostructures to design a chemical compass inspired by theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "according to the theoretical and experimental studies , the internal anisotropic magnetic field is the key factor for product yields of the photochemical reactions to be sensitive to the angle with respect to the external magnetic field @xcite . in some molecules ,",
    "the hyperfine coupling provides the internal anisotropic magnetic field .",
    "however , when designing a real device , the hyperfine coupling can be replaced by a local strong gradient magnetic field , which can be created in the vicinity of a hard ferromagnetic nanostructure by applying a spatially uniform bias field that cancels the field of the nanostructure in a small region @xcite . in simulations ,",
    "such a device exhibits significant directional sensitivity @xcite . +   +",
    "other studies have achieved to map nanomagnetic field using a radical pair reaction @xcite and found a method to improve the magnetic sensitivity of chemical magnetometers @xcite .",
    "biological mechanisms , such as magnetoreception in birds , are powered by the chemical machinery , which consists of complex molecules structured at the nanoscale and sub - nanoscale .",
    "the dynamics of the chemical machinery at such small scales is regulated by the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "as one of the main features of complex quantum systems , the quantum coherence between different sub - systems , can ultimately lead to many collective phenomena , such as the quantum entanglement .",
    "[ [ thermal - noise ] ] thermal noise + + + + + + + + + + + + +    quantum effects , such as coherence and entanglement , are easily destroyed by interactions with the environment . there is a rule of thumb , the @xmath90 argument , stating that when the energy of the interaction is smaller than room temperature , then quantum coherent effects can not persist .",
    "intuitively , because the temperature of the biological systems is around 300@xmath91 , which is hot , thermal fluctuations will destroy the quantum coherent effects .",
    "however , the @xmath90 argument can break down when dealing with living systems like birds .",
    "the thermal argument is true only for the equilibrium state , which the system approaches for relatively long times .",
    "however , if the equilibrium is approached rapidly , coherent quantum effects can survive ( at equilibrium ) even at room temperatures @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the quantum coherent effects , including the quantum entanglement , can survive as the system approaches the equilibrium with the surrounding environment . in another word ,",
    "the quantum effects are used before the system has time to equilibrate with the environment .",
    "the latter situation is believed to be what happens in the radical pair mechanism of the avian compass @xcite . +   + since the geomagnetic field is very weak ( @xmath92 @xmath93 ) , the effects of such a weak magnetic field , in biological systems , can easily be masked by the thermal fluctuations .",
    "to take advantage of the weak geomagnetic field , one effective method is to use the short - lived , specialized photochemical reactions .",
    "then the thermal fluctuations do not have enough time to effectively mask the effects of the weak magnetic fields .",
    "the radical pair mechanism is believed to rely on this process @xcite . +   + if the useful signal carries more energy than the thermal noise , this signal can be distinguished from the noise .",
    "but since the energy differences , due to the geomagnetic fields , between the singlet and the triplet states are generally small , and are even smaller in living organisms , the chemical reaction of radical pairs is a subject to a significant thermal noise @xcite . however , due to the short lifetime of the radical pair reactions , and due to the fast conversion rate between singlet and triplet states , the photochemical reactions can produce a bird - detectable signal through the yields of singlet and triplet states , in spite of the thermal noise .",
    "weaver @xmath71 @xmath72 . also discussed the detection limit in the radical pair mechanism , and claimed that a chemical compass in birds is feasible with the chemical reactions with certain rate constants @xcite .",
    "+   +    [ [ dephasing - noise ] ] dephasing noise + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    other than thermal noise , dephasing noise can only affect the coherences between singlets and triplets . once the radicals come close to each other , dipolar and exchange interaction can no longer be neglected .",
    "for instance , if the exchange interaction is considered , the electron singlet and triplet states will be separated in energy , which can destroy the conversion between the singlet and the triplet @xcite . however , since the molecule motion can be quickly distributed over the environment owing to brownian molecule motion , the microscopic causes of the path taken are quickly lost . in addition , the involved energy scales are much smaller when compared with the energy released owing to recombination@xcite .",
    "therefore , the dephasing noise can hardly harm the coherence since the molecular motions that cause spin - decoherence by modulating hyperfine interactions have either low amplitude or high frequency or both .",
    "+   + there are many papers that discuss the effects of dephasing noise on the radical pair mechanism via lindblad operators @xcite .",
    "intuitively , one might expect that dephasing noise is unfavorable for the function of the chemical compass .",
    "however , these studies show that the effect of noise depends on the model . in gauger s model ,",
    "the compass mechanism is almost immune to pure phase noise @xcite .",
    "cai argued that correlated dephasing noise could even enhance the chemical compass in their model @xcite .",
    "both models give us positive , or at least non - negative , perspectives concerning dephasing noise .      as we know",
    "quantum coherence describes a particle s ability to exist simultaneously in several distinct states , such as position , energy , or spin .",
    "quantum coherence plays a crucial role in the energy transport in photosynthetic complexes @xcite .",
    "there is indirect evidence indicating that the quantum coherence exists in bird navigation @xcite .",
    "the proposed radical pair mechanism for avian compass postulates that absorption of blue or green light creates a radical pair of electrons .",
    "the radical pair undergoes coherent quantum oscillations between entangled singlet and triplet states , at a rate depending on the external magnetic fields .",
    "finally , the pairs in the singlet and the triplet states will lead to different chemical products , providing orientation information for birds .",
    "so , the quantum coherence plays an important role in this mechanism .",
    "quantum entanglement is the quantum mechanical property that allows two or more particles to be correlated differently and stronger than the same classically correlated particles .",
    "this also means that while the global state of the system is perfectly known , the local state is fully mixed .",
    "the entanglement creates the non - local correlations , and the non - thermal excitations @xcite .",
    "+   + quantum entanglement plays a key role in the radical pair mechanism of the avian compass . a single electron photo - excitation and a subsequent electron translocation leads to an entangled state , which provides the necessary spin correlations .",
