    "since the first discovery by @xcite , more than 200 extrasolar planet candidates have been discovered . among the currently known extrasolar planet - hosting stars , approximately 20% are members of binaries or multiple systems @xcite .",
    "nearly all of the planets in these systems revolve around only one of the stars .",
    "the only exception is the planetary system psr b1620 - 26 @xcite , but this system consists of not normal stars but a pulsar and a white dwarf .    besides the orbital configuration of the known planets in binaries where the planet revolves around one of the widely separated binary members ,",
    "a planet can stay in a stable orbit if the planet is located well outside the binary stars and thus seeing the two stars as approximately a single object .",
    "however , such planets , which were imagined as a planet with two simultaneously rising suns in the _ star wars _ saga ( tatooine ) , have not been seen in planet searches using the radial velocity technique because the search programs avoid short - period binary stars . the chance to detect such planets via",
    "the transit technique is also very low because these planets tend to have wide orbits .",
    "planets in binary stellar systems can be detected by using the microlensing technique . such a possibility was first mentioned by @xcite .",
    "they reported a candidate planet orbiting around a binary system from the observation and light - curve modeling of a microlensing event macho-97-blg-41 .",
    "however , their interpretation of this event is very special in the sense that the source trajectory is precisely aligned with the line connecting the planet and the center of mass of the binary . besides",
    ", the interpretation of the signal was rejected because a rotating binary - lens model provides an excellent fit to the observed data @xcite .",
    "@xcite also investigated the lensing signal of planets in binary systems .",
    "however , their analysis is restricted to planets orbiting around one of the binary members . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the feasibility of detecting planets with two simultaneously rising suns by using the microlensing technique .",
    "the general geometry of a planet revolving around the stars of a close binary is such that the separation between the stars is much smaller than the star - planet separation ( see figure 1 ) . under this geometry ,",
    "the lensing behavior of the triple lens system can be greatly simplified because the close stellar binary pair and the planet can be separately treated .",
    "the lensing behavior of the close stellar binary pair is mostly described by the single mass lens located at the center of the mass of the binary system with a mass equal to the total mass of the binary .",
    "a small deviation occurs around the caustic which forms close to the center of mass .",
    "the caustic represents the set of source positions at which the magnification of a point source becomes infinite . for a close binary , the caustic has the shape of an asymmetric hypocycloid with four cusps and the asymmetry increases as the mass ratio between the stars , @xmath1 , decreases . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the masses of the heavier and lighter binary components , respectively .",
    "the caustic size depends weakly on the mass ratio , but it decreases rapidly with the decrease of the stellar separation . for a close binary , then , the perturbation region is confined to a small region around the center of mass of the binary .",
    "the planet , on the other hand , causes formation of two sets of disconnected caustics .",
    "one set is located away from the host star .",
    "the other set is located close to the planet - hosting star , which coincides with the region of the binary - induced perturbation .",
    "the latter caustic ( central caustic ) has an elongated wedge - like shape .",
    "the size of the planet - induced central caustics depends both on the star - planet separation and the planet / star mass ratio @xcite .",
    "the planet - induced caustic is small due to the small mass ratio of the planet .",
    "however , its size becomes non - negligible when the planetary separation is equivalent to the einstein radius @xcite .",
    "the small sizes of the deviation regions induced by the planet and the host binary stars greatly simplify the description of the lensing behavior of the system .",
    "this is because each deviation can be treated as a perturbation and thus the lensing behavior of the triple lens system is approximated as the superposition of those of the two sets of binary lenses composed of the binary star pair and the pair composed of the planet and a virtual star located at the center of the mass of the binary stars with a mass equal to the total mass of the binary .",
    "in addition , the coincidence of the individual perturbation regions might enable to detect both signatures of the planet and host binary stars from high magnification events for which the source trajectory passes close to the common region of perturbation .",
    "with the possible approximation of binary superposition in mind , we investigate the magnification pattern in the central region of various triple lens systems composed of a planet around binary stars . for this",
    ", we construct magnification map , which represents the map of lensing magnification as a function of the source star position . for the construction of the map",
    ", we use the ray - shooting method .",
    "we choose this method because it allows not only simple procedure of multiple - lensing magnification computation but also easy incorporation of the finite - source effect .",
    "figure 2 shows the maps for a saturn - mass planet revolving around binary stars with a total mass of @xmath4 and a mass ratio of @xmath5 .",
    "the labels above and on the right side of the figure represent the projected separations between binary stars ( binary separation , @xmath6 ) and between the planet and the center of mass of the binary ( planetary separation , @xmath7 ) , respectively . in each map ,",
    "the coordinates are centered at the position of the center of mass of the binary stars and the @xmath8-axis is aligned with the binary axis , where the heavier star is on the right . for all tested cases ,",
    "the planets have a common position angle of @xmath9 as measured counterclockwise from the binary axis ( see figure  [ fig : one ] ) .",
    "the grey - scale is drawn such that brighter tone represents the region of higher magnification .",
    "the figures drawn in solid curves represent the caustics . since the caustics induced by the planet and binary stars are small , finite - source effect would be important in magnification pattern @xcite .",
    "we consider the effect by assuming that the source star has a radius equivalent to that of the sun .",
    "we assume that events are observed toward the galactic bulge field and the distances to the lens and source are @xmath10 kpc and @xmath11 kpc , respectively , by adopting those of a typical galactic bulge event @xcite .",
    "then , the corresponding einstein radius is @xmath12^{1/2}\\sim 2.5 $ ] au and the source size normalized by the einstein radius is @xmath13 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : three ] , we also present the light curves resulting from the source trajectories marked by straight lines on the maps . in each panel , there exist three light curves .",
    "the thick solid light curve is for the triple - lens event , while the curves drawn in red and blue colors are for the cases where there is no planet and the planet - hosting star is a single object , respectively .    from figure 2 and 3",
    ", we find that the influence of the planet and binary stars on the pattern of perturbation varies depending on the binary and planetary separations .",
    "when the binary separation is small and the planetary separation is equivalent to the einstein radius , the planet dominates the perturbation pattern .",
    "these correspond to the cases blocked by thick black solid lines in figure 2 . on the contrary",
    ", the binary dominates the perturbation pattern when the binary separation is considerable and the planetary separation is either too large or too small compared to the einstein radius .",
    "these correspond to the cases enclosed by thick white solid lines in figure  [ fig : two ] . for events produced by these lens systems ,",
    "then , the resulting perturbation would be well described by a binary lens of either star - planet or binary star pair .",
    "however , for lens systems with separations located in the neutral region of the @xmath6@xmath7 parameter space , the influences of the planet and stellar binary are equivalent and thus it would be possible to detect both signals of the planet and binary stars .",
    "ccc jupiter - mass & @xmath14 & @xmath15 + saturn - mass & @xmath16 & @xmath15 + uranus - mass & @xmath17 & @xmath15",
    "then , what are the optimal ranges of the binary and planetary separations for which the microlensing technique is sensitive to the detections of planets orbiting around binary stars . in this section",
    ", we investigate these optimal ranges .    the size of the perturbation region is proportional to the size of the caustic .",
    "we , therefore , determine the optimal region in the @xmath6@xmath7 parameter space as the one within which the sizes of the planet and binary - induced caustics become equivalent .",
    "figure  [ fig : four ] shows the regions found under this approximation for three different types of jupiter , saturn , and uranus - mass planets . for lens systems with planetary and binary separations located in the shaded region ,",
    "the size ratio between the two types of caustic is in the range of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the sizes of the planet and binary - induced caustics , respectively .",
    "we apply two exceptions to this rule .",
    "the first is that if both caustics are too small , we assume that the signal detection would be difficult due to severe finite - source effect . to account for the finite - source effect , we set the lower limit of the caustic size for signal detection as two times of the source size .",
    "the second exception is that if both caustics are greater than a certain value , we assume that the chance to detect both planet and stellar binary is not small .",
    "we set this threshold caustics size as 10 times of the source size . from the comparison of the optimal ranges determined in this way with those of the neutral region judged based on eye inspection of the maps in figure  [ fig : two ] , we find good agreement .",
    "the optimal ranges vary depending on the planet mass . for a jupiter - mass planet",
    ", we find that high detection efficiency is expected for planets located in the range of @xmath21 orbiting around binaries with separations of @xmath22 .",
    "the range of the planetary separation shrinks as the planet mass decreases .",
    "however , the range of the binary separation remains nearly the same regardless of the planet mass . in table",
    "[ table : one ] , we summarize the optimal ranges for various types of planets",
    ".    it might be that planets located in some portions of the tested @xmath6@xmath7 parameter space might be dynamically unstable and thus the estimated optimal region is overestimated . at present , however , the possible extent of the planet separation around stars of a close binary system is an open question and is subject to be tested from observation . in this sense",
    ", the constraint of the stable region of the planetary separation that will be provided by the microlensing method is very important .",
    "interpreting the signals of triple - lens systems is not an easy task . with more complete understanding of lensing behavior and the development of efficient modelling codes ,",
    "however , such analysis is being started for the analysis of observed lensing events ( a. gould private communication ) . not long ago",
    ", binary - lens modelling was considered to be a difficult task , but now it is routinely conducted for binary events . considering this ,",
    "triple - lens modelling would be possible in future lensing analysis .",
    "nevertheless , one might think of several possible degenerate cases to the signal of the planet orbiting a close binary stars .",
    "one possible case is a triple lens system where a planet orbits around one of widely separated binary stars . in this case , the binary - produced caustic is located also close to the planet - induced caustic , causing potential degeneracy .",
    "however , the caustic produced by the wide - separation binary has a very symmetric hypocycloid shape , while the shape of the caustic produced by close binary stars is in general asymmetric .",
    "therefore , the resulting patterns of the two cases are different and thus it would not be difficult to distinguish the two cases . another possible case is a star with multiple planets @xcite . here the perturbations in the central region are produced by the individual planets .",
    "the planet - induced caustics are much more elongated than binary - induced caustic .",
    "therefore , it would not be difficult to distinguish this case , either .",
    "planets around close binary stars will be detected through the channel of high - magnification events .",
    "current microlensing follow - up observations @xcite are focusing on these events due to their high efficiency in planet detections @xcite . by using multiple telescopes located at different locations , these observations enable dense and continuous coverage of events which is required to detect the short - lasting signature of the planet in binary stars .",
    "in addition , greatly enhanced source brightness of high - magnification events enables precision photometry which is essential for the characterization of the signature .",
    "therefore , we predict that planets with two simultaneously rising suns would be detected in the near future .",
    "we investigated the feasibility of detecting planets orbiting close binary stars by using the microlensing technique .",
    "we presented the channel for which one can identify the signatures of such planetary systems .",
    "we illustrated the signatures for various planet - binary configurations and explained the tendencies of the signatures .",
    "we also estimated the ranges of the binary and planetary separations for which the microlensing method is efficient in detecting these planetary systems .",
    "discovering planets orbiting around close binary stars is difficult by using the radial velocity or transit technique .",
    "therefore , microlensing is an important technique that can provide information about these planetary systems , which is very important for our understanding of planet formation ."
