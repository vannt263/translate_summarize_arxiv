    "conversion of the halo merger rate into galaxy merger rate has to rely on assumptions of baryonic physics adopted in the theoretical models of galaxy evolution such as the sub - halo structures and mass functions , halo occupation statistics , gas hydrodynamics and cooling , star formation and feedback ( @xcite for reference therein ) . on the observational side , measurements of galaxy merger rate from morphological studies and pair studies",
    "are not consistent with each other @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy arises from uncertainties in sample selection , identification of mergers , correction for false mergers , incompleteness with redshift , cosmic variance and uncertainty in estimation of merger timescale .",
    "galaxy merger rate is estimated through counting either close pairs or morphology - disturbed galaxies .",
    "for the latter , visual examination and non - parametric methods are widely used to select galaxy major mergers , which often exhibit tidal features like shells , arcs , plumes , rings , streams , tails and double cores .",

    "tidal tails are created in major mergers involving at least one disk galaxy and can be used as a secure sign of major merger event @xcite .",

    "the length and orientation of tidal tails turn out to be regulated by the inclination of progenitor disk galaxies to the approaching orbit .",

    "tidal tails are faint structures and usually contribute only limited fraction of the total light of a merging system . the morphological parameters rotational asymmetry @xmath15 , gini and @xmath16 are likely insensitive to probe of such faint structures in a galaxy because these parameters are flux weighted and usually dominated by luminous structures of the galaxy .",

    "then the question is what fraction of overall galaxy major mergers display long tidal tails ?",
    "we discuss the representative measurements of galaxy merger rate from the literature and our measurement respectively , and try to draw an answer to this question .",
    "many studies have been contributed to the measurement of merger fraction of galaxies using a variety of selection techniques , incompleteness corrections and parent galaxy samples .",
    "an agreement has been reached between these studies , giving that galaxy merger fraction globally increases with redshift .",
    "still , significant discrepancy can be seen between different measurements .    in figure",
    "[ fig : figk ] we collect representative measurements of merger rate corrected to roughly the same mass selection @xmath111 and ensure the merger rates are measured approximately from the same galaxy population .",
    "it is worth noting that evolving luminosity cuts are performed for sample selection in the literature ( e.g. , @xmath112 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the luminosity cuts are based on a model of passive luminosity evolution ( ple ) of galaxies .",
    "@xcite argued that such cuts may select similar galaxy population as those derived through a fixed stellar - mass cut @xmath113 .",
    "we thus include their results in figure  [ fig : figk ] for comparison .",
    "we caution that major merger rates from @xcite and @xcite in the figure [ fig : figk ] are based on a sample of galaxy with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "we caution that their selection cuts are higher than ours , although we include these results for comparison .",
    "we can see that merger rates of close pairs are consistent with each other within the uncertainties , and the global merger rate can be best fitted by @xmath116 .",
    "this indicates that a galaxy would undergo 0.8 major ( wet@xmath117dry ) mergers since @xmath4 , about 2.5 times higher than our measurement on mergers with tidal tails .",
    "note that the merger rates of close pairs are converted from pair fractions ( @xmath118 ) instead of fractions of galaxies in pairs ( @xmath119 ) @xcite , allowing comparison with merger rates from morphology studies .",
    "for this reason , two galaxies linked by a tidal bridge are counted as one merger event in this work . on the other hand ,",
    "merger rate derived using morphological techniques are usually higher than those derived from close pairs .",
    "this is because the morphological selection for major mergers may be contaminated by minor mergers .",
    "furthermore , galaxy pairs are early - stage mergers and thus correspond to progenitors of disturbed merging galaxies .",
    "galaxies in morphological studies will be less massive or fainter than galaxies in pair studies if a uniform stellar - mass or brightness limit is adopted for sample selection .",
    "we should keep this in mind when merger rates of galaxies with disturbed morphology are directly compared with merger rates of pairs .      using the @xmath2 technique together with visual examination",
    ", we identify 461 galaxies having long tidal tails among 35076 galaxies with @xmath37 and @xmath40 in the cosmos field .",
    "the tidal tails are known as low - surface - brightness features and hardly detectable at high @xmath10 due to the cosmic dimming effect . by redshifting a sample of model galaxies constructed from low-@xmath10 ones with a diversity of morphologies",
    ", we quantify the systematic biases in the measurements of the morphological parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 at three redshifts @xmath71 and 0.9 . the corrections for the incompleteness in detection of tidal tails",
    "are derived through simulations and applied to the measured numbers of mergers listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] to obtain the merger fractions in different stellar mass and redshift bins . adopting an average detection timescale of 0.5gyr",
    ", the merger fractions can be converted into merger rates .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : figj ] , our results reveal that the merger fraction of tidal - tailed galaxies mildly increases with redshift following @xmath120 , and less massive galaxies contain a higher fraction of tailed mergers than massive ones at all cosmic epochs examined .",
    "the increase of galaxy fraction with redshift is generally consistent with the most measurements listed in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "moreover , the dependence of merger fraction on stellar mass ( or luminosity ) are also reported in previous works ( e.g. , ; b10 ) .",
    "however , the measurements based on close pairs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) favor the opposite that massive galaxies are more likely to host companions than less massive galaxies .",
    "a possible reason for this discrepancy is the bias in pair identification due to the strong clustering effect ( i.e. , galaxies reside in groups or clusters but are assumed to merge , * ? ? ?",
    "another reason could be due to the cosmic variance as the sample used in @xcite is rather small and probably leave large uncertainties in their results .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ fig : figj ] implies the merger fraction of massive galaxies increases more rapidly with redshift than less massive galaxies .",
    "the best - fit power index @xmath121 is 1.6 , 2.1 , 3.5 and 5.0 for galaxy mass bins from the low- to high - mass end , respectively .",
    "this predicts that merger fraction of massive galaxies would become higher than that of less massive galaxies at @xmath122 , consistent with the findings from previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; b10 ) .",
    "moreover , we stress that merger fraction of galaxies with @xmath123 at @xmath124 may probably be underestimated due to the difficulties in finding faint tidal tails in visual examination of low - mass galaxies at @xmath125 .",
    "the underestimation of merger fraction may result in a lower @xmath121 for the lowest - mass bin .",
    "the sample completeness of the lowest - mass bin is relatively larger although the global completeness galaxies at @xmath126 and @xmath4 is estimated to be about 95% .",
    "this also increases the uncertainties of merger fraction for low - mass galaxies .",
    "b10 used similar probes ( tidal tails and bridges ) to identify galaxy mergers .",
    "we notice that their merger fraction is substantially higher and evolve more rapidly with redshift than our results .",
    "the discrepancy may be attributed to several reasons .",
    "first , more than one third of the mergers identified in b10 are not included in our statistics .",
    "these mergers either display a tidal bridge linking one galaxy to the other or double cores but no tail is presented .",
    "second , a close pair of galaxies with tidal tails is counted as one merging event in our analysis .",
    "such system is seen as two mergers in b10 if a bridge is shown , leading to roughly another 3% enhancement of their merger rate .",
    "moreover , the parent sample in b10 is selected using both stellar mass and brightness cuts .",
    "we argue that the brightness cut may lead to strong bias in particularly at high @xmath10 .",
    "star formation triggered by wet mergers can enhance the brightness of the host galaxies .",
    "a brightness selection would favor the detection of star - forming galaxies and possibly more mergers .",
    "galaxy pairs can be divided into early - type galaxy pairs , late - type galaxy pairs and mixed pairs .",
    "mergers between two gas - poor early - type galaxies ( dry mergers ) are thought to be a major channel for the assembly of massive ( @xmath127 ) galaxies at @xmath128 .",
    "but early - type galaxy pairs contribute little to the total number of galaxy pairs , from @xmath129 in the present day to @xmath130 at @xmath131 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figk ] presents the comparison of the merger rate of tidal - tailed galaxies with the global merger rate derived from close galaxy pairs in the literature ( see section  [ sec : sum ] ) .",
    "we find that the merger rate of tailed galaxies roughly accounts for a half of the global merger rate when the contribution of early - type galaxy pairs are removed .",
    "we conclude from figure  [ fig : figk ] that roughly half of disk - involved major mergers have undergone a phase exhibiting long tidal tails at @xmath128 .",
    "the absence of tidal tail in disk - involved mergers may be attributed to special orbital parameters .",
    "for instance , long tidal tails are preferentially formed in prograde encounters where the spin of a disk aligns with the orbital spin .",
    "however , only weak , warped tails can be generated in retrograde encounters .",
    "therefore , our merger sample is biased against retrograde mergers . in the case of head - on collision",
    "( with impact parameter of zero ) between a disk and a compact spheroid galaxy , ring - like debris instead of tidal tail forms and radially expands due to the density wave created by the interaction @xcite .",
    "the head - on collisions are not commonly seen and arp147 @xcite and 2masxj06470249 + 4554022 , dubbed as `` auriga s wheel '' @xcite are two of this kind . on the other hand , in our work",
    "tidal tails are identified if they are longer than the diameters of their hosts .",
    "this implies that tidal tails with fixed lengths are easily selected in small galaxies and thus our selection probably misses some tidal tails in larger galaxies .",
    "in addition , a tidal tail could not be identified if its orientation is nearly coincident with the line of sight and appears to be much shortened due to the projection effect .",
    "tidal tails of mergers at @xmath132 might be quite different from their local counterparts .",
    "representative disk galaxies at @xmath132 contain a few kpc - scaled blue spheroids on their disks and have clumpy morphology @xcite .",
    "the formation of the clumpy disks might result from the gravitational instability and fragmentation in gas - rich disks which are continuously fed by cosmological streams .",
    "simulations predicted that ongoing mergers of these galaxies will form clumps and filaments in the intergalactic space instead of long tidal tails as what observed in lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the formation of tidal tails might not be common during the disk - disk mergers at @xmath132 and care should be taken when counting mergers with tidal tails in those cosmic epochs .",
    "we carry out a careful morphological analysis using deep _ hst_/acs f814w imaging data for a complete sample of 35076 galaxies with @xmath126 at @xmath133 selected from the ultravista catalog of the cosmos field .",
    "two newly developed morphological parameters , the outer asymmetry @xmath17 and the outer centroid deviation @xmath18 are measured from galaxy images to probe asymmetric features in the outskirts of galaxies .",
    "the sample galaxies of different morphological types form a tight sequence in the @xmath2 diagram , showing that the degree of morphological disturbance globally increases with @xmath17 and @xmath18 and these with highly - irregular structures occupy the high - value end . merging galaxies with long tidal tails are pre - selected using the @xmath2 selection technique , and further identified through visual examination .",
    "this type of galaxies are believed to be major mergers involving at least one disk galaxy .",
    "how the cosmic surface brightness dimming effects on the measurements of the two parameters are quantitatively estimated through simulations and the detection completeness for tidal - tailed galaxies are derived accordingly .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    * we find that the widely - used morphological parameter , asymmetry @xmath15 , is significantly biased by the noise in the outskirts of a galaxy due to an incorrect treatment of the background subtraction .",
    "we provide a revised definition of @xmath15 by including corrections for noise contamination .",
    "we also update the equation for computing the outer asymmetry @xmath17 and correct for the the noise term .",
    "details are given in the appendix  a. * simulations are performed to quantify the effects of the cosmic surface brightness dimming on the measurements of @xmath17 and @xmath18 as a function of redshift , giving that the two parameters would be overestimated for galaxies with regular morphologies ( intrinsically small in @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and be underestimated for those with disturbed morphologies ( intrinsically large in @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "the degree of the estimate bias is inversely correlated with galaxy stellar mass ( and luminosity ) .",
    "the simulations suggest that 78 , 72 and 62 percents of long tidal tails are detectable with the cosmos _ hst_/acs images at @xmath134 and 0.9 , respectively . * in total 461 galaxies are identified to have long tidal tails from 13227 merger candidates selected using the @xmath2 technique from the parent sample of 35076 galaxies over @xmath40 .",
    "these galaxies spread in the same region as star - forming galaxies in the @xmath74 and @xmath135 diagram , confirming that tidal - tailed galaxies originate from the population of star - forming galaxies with morphologies dominated by disks . *",
    "we show that the fraction of mergers with long tidal tails evolves mildly with redshift following a power - law function @xmath136 out to @xmath4 .",
    "we also find that the tidal - tailed merger fraction is higher for less massive galaxies .",
    "however , merger fraction of massive sample evolves more strongly with redshift , indicating higher merger fraction of massive sample at @xmath137 . these are consistent with the results from previous studies . * adopting an average detection timescale of 0.5gyr for tidal - tail - traced mergers , we obtain the evolution of the merger rate of such type of merging galaxies as @xmath138gyr@xmath6 .",
    "combined with the global merger rate derived from close pairs , we find that nearly half of disk - involved major mergers at @xmath128 have undergone a phase with long tidal tails .",
    "we infer that a present - day galaxy would undergo about 0.3 major mergers creating long tidal tails since @xmath4 , roughly one - third of the total budget of major mergers .",

    "is estimated by measuring @xmath15 on a nearby blank sky region with the same aperture .",
    "however , the noise correction for @xmath15 overestimates the real noise contribution ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "here we present a detailed analysis on the noise effects in quantifying @xmath15 and introduce a revised correction for noise contamination .",
    "we construct a sample of model galaxies for testing the morphological parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the sample consists of 569 isolated galaxies from @xcite ( see section  [ sec : simulation ] for more details about model generation ) .",
    "an artificial image is obtained through combining a model galaxy image with a background noise image .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is measured from both the artificial image and the noise - free model image following the definition given in @xcite as @xmath139 where @xmath46 is the intensity of the galaxy and @xmath47 is the 180@xmath140-rotated intensity .",
    "the second term refers to the correction for noise contamination .",
    "a group of pixels are randomly selected from the background regions to form the background noise image . in the measurement , an aperture of 1.5 times the circular petrosian aperture is adopted to estimate the noise contamination .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] presents comparison of the measure of @xmath15 from noise - added and noise - free images for the 569 model galaxies .",
    "we find that noise contamination leads @xmath15 to be systematically overestimated and the significant scatter indicates the uncertainties of noise contribution which is about 20% for a high - s / n galaxy and reaches 50% for a low - s / n galaxy @xcite .",
    "the noise correction introduced in @xcite overestimates the noise contamination and biases @xmath15 to be smaller .",
    "this is because that all background pixels within the petrosian aperture are used to calculate the noise contamination .",
    "as discussed in next section , however , we argue that noise contamination is correlated with the number fraction of noise dominated pixels of a galaxy indicating that only a part of the noise contribution estimated by equation [ equ : eqoa ] is real . furthermore , the measured @xmath15 from noise - added images is found to be lower than that from noise - free model images in a few cases even if no noise correction is adopted . this is because that noise dramatically changes the segmentation maps of the model galaxies . in our measurements ,",
    "only pixels within 1.5 times the circular petrosian aperture are counted to calculate @xmath15 and the extended structures of the model galaxies out of the aperture are ignored , leading to an underestimation in @xmath15 . for a noise - free model galaxy image , all pixels associated with the galaxy are used to compute @xmath15 .    .",
    "for galaxy image with noise , the measurement of @xmath15 is biased , as denoted by the blue data points ( no correction for noise contamination ) .",
    "red data points show the measurements of @xmath15 after including correction for the noise contamination introduced by @xcite .",
    "it is clearly that the noise correction leaves @xmath15 underestimated .",
    "the dashed line indicates the 1:1 relation between @xmath141 and @xmath142 . ]      to calculate @xmath15 of a galaxy , one needs to measure the signal remained in the residual image relative to that in the scientific image .",
    "mathematically , the modules of pixels in each image are derived and then the summation is performed .",
    "pixels dominated by random noise likely significantly contribute to the summation even if little signal is included . as a consequence ,",
    "different outputs are generated from noise - added image of a galaxy and the noise - free model . for a luminous galaxy that all pixels are brighter than @xmath143 of the noise ,",
    "equivalent outputs are generated from the noise - added image and the model galaxy .",
    "it is thus important to quantify the number fraction of noise dominated pixels in the image of a galaxy against those signal dominated . in practice,1@xmath29 of noise level",
    "is adopted as the criterion for the classification .",
    "the noise level is measured independently from the background .",
    "the updated equation of @xmath15 is given by @xmath144 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath145 and @xmath45 .",
    "parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 measure the noise contributions within the @xmath46 and the residual image @xmath146 respectively .",
    "parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 give the number fractions of noise dominated pixels relative to the total while @xmath56 and @xmath57 mark the total number of pixels assigned to the galaxy in @xmath46 and the residual image .",
    "parameter @xmath29 is the standard deviation of noise in @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , the residual image is derived by combining @xmath46 with @xmath147 where image of gaussian distributed noise as well as its 180@xmath140-rotated version are overlapped on . the standard deviation of the noise in the residual image increases by a factor of @xmath148 relative to that in the @xmath46 .",
    "for this reason , pixels within @xmath149 are defined as noise dominated pixels in the residual image .",
    "the size of a galaxy is determined by the petrosian aperture and the pixels within 1.5 times the elliptical petrosian aperture of the galaxy are used to compute @xmath15 .",
    "elliptical apertures more closely follow the light profile of galaxies than circular apertures , especially for edge - on disks .",
    "the rotational centers of either model galaxies , background images or artificial galaxies are determined by an iterative process respectively . the initial center ( usually the flux - weighted centroid of a galaxy ) together with the eight pixels surrounded",
    "will be tested in turn until the minimum value of asymmetry is found .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] compares the new measurements of @xmath15 from noise - added images with the measurements from the models .",
    "the new measurements of @xmath15 are in line with the initial values of the models .",
    "only @xmath150 cases show large offsets from the initial @xmath15 . in these cases ,",
    "extended structures out of the 1.5 times elliptical petrosian radius of an artificial galaxy are not included in the measurements but they are included when the initial @xmath15 of the model is measured .",
    "the determination of rotational center of the artificial galaxy thus deviates from that of the model galaxy .",
    "we also notice that the slope of the data - points in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] will change if the criterion for selecting noise dominated pixels in the @xmath46 is set other than @xmath151 of the noise .",
    "we thus apply the revised noise correction to @xmath17 .",
    "the details for updated definition of @xmath17 is given in section  [ sec : ao ] .",
    "in contrast to the petrosian radius , the size of a galaxy is directly determined by the segmentation map when @xmath17 is computed .",
