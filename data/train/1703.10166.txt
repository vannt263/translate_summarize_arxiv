    "in inflationary cosmology , the correlation functions of fields at late times are linked to the observed correlations of primordial fluctuation , and thus are of central importance .",
    "these correlation functions are expectation values of field operators at a later time with the initial state ( or `` in '' state ) given .",
    "this is different from the @xmath2-matrix elements familiar to particle physicists , where both the `` in '' state and the `` out '' state are specified . to calculate such expectation values",
    ", there is a well - developed canonical in - in formalism in the literature , which resembles the operator approach to @xmath2-matrix . in this formalism",
    ", one can do calculation by expanding the dyson series and doing field contractions order by order . see @xcite for reviews of the canonical in - in formalism .    on the other hand , as is well known in particle physics , the most convenient way to write down expressions for @xmath2-matrix elements in perturbation theory is to use feynman diagrams . in particular , when the theory is classically defined by a lagrangian , it is most convenient to derive the feynman rules directly from the lagrangian in the language of path integral . in this way , we free ourselves from the trouble of switching to hamiltonian and doing field contractions by hand . more importantly , this approach allows us to do calculation neatly in gauge theories ( including gravity ) .",
    "similarly , it is desirable to compute expectation values by drawing feynman diagrams in inflationary cosmology .",
    "the well - known schwinger - keldysh ( sk ) formalism is in place for this purpose",
    ". introduced originally in the seminal papers by schwinger @xcite , keldysh @xcite , and feynman and vernon @xcite , the sk formalism has found wide applications in many branches of theoretical physics , due to ubiquitous need for computing expectation values .",
    "see @xcite for reviews of sk formalism from various aspects .",
    "in fact , the diagrammatic approach of the sk formalism is also known in cosmology community , and has been invoked in the literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "see also @xcite for introductions to this approach in cosmology .",
    "however , it seems that the convenience and advantage of diagrammatic calculation are not widely appreciated in previous studies .",
    "for one thing , although the diagrams provide a nice way of organizing perturbation series , apparently they do not by themselves bring much simplification for practical calculation .",
    "indeed , the expressions written following diagrammatic rules must be identical to the ones found from the canonical in - in formalism , if the two formalisms are really equivalent .",
    "but this is not the whole story . in this paper",
    ", we would like to emphasize the point that the diagrammatic approach based on sk path integral not only provides a convenient organizing principle for the perturbation series , but also brings considerable simplifications to practical calculations . since the diagrams make the structures of in - in integrals more transparent , they enable us to simplify the calculation dramatically with the help of some almost trivial tricks . in the example we shall show in this paper ,",
    "the diagrammatic method can make the numerical calculation @xmath3 times faster than directly applying the canonical in - in formalism .",
    "moreover , the diagrammatic rules can be conveniently got from a lagrangian , even in the presence of derivative couplings often encountered in cosmological context .",
    "this is again advantageous over the canonical in - in formalism , where the derivative couplings make the form of interaction - picture hamiltonian rather complicated .    therefore ,",
    "in order to make our point clearer and the paper more accessible to a wider range of readers , we feel it appropriate to present a self - contained introduction to sk formalism for inflationary cosmology ( sec.[sec_skf ] ) . in doing so , we also give a careful treatment of derivative couplings which are somewhat overlooked in previous studies using sk formalism in cosmology .",
    "in particular , we prove in appendix [ sec_dc ] that the lagrangian used in path integral agrees with the classical lagrangian to 4th order in power of fields when there are arbitrary derivative couplings .",
    "we further illustrate the agreement between canonical in - in formalism and the sk path integral in a specific example involving derivative coupling , in appendix [ sec_sampledc ] .",
    "a far more interesting application of this formalism is presented in sec.[sec_qsfi ] , where we calculate the 3-point and 4-point correlation functions ( bispectrum and trispectrum , respectively ) in quasi - single - field inflation @xcite .",
    "together with a small trick of `` mixed propagator '' , the diagrammatic method enables us to write down neat expressions for the 3-point and 4-point functions . in the case of 3-point function ,",
    "the expression is much more compact than what we get from canonical in - in formalism , which also speeds up the numerical calculation significantly as mentioned above .",
    "we recover the result of the lighter scalar field case ( @xmath0 ) that has been studied previously @xcite , and also provide new results for the heavier scalar field case ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the results for 4-point functions shown in this paper are also new .",
    "concluding remarks , including the discussion about the applicability of this formalism are presented in sec.[sec_discussion ] .",
    "we collect some useful results for massive scalar fields in inflation in appendix [ sec_mf ] .",
    "readers who wish a quick look at the diagrammatic rules may go directly to sec.[sec_summary ] for a summary .",
    "in this section , we present a self - contained introduction to schwinger - keldysh formalism and the related diagrammatic rules adapted for primordial perturbations . most of this section is a review of known results , except that we provide an explicit treatment of @xmath4-prescription in inflation background , and also a perturbative proof of the equivalence between the classical lagrangian and the `` effective '' lagrangian used in path integral , to 4th order in the power of field , in the presence of derivative coupling , as elaborated in appendix [ sec_dc ] .",
    "furthermore , we come up with a set of diagrammatic notations which is convenient for our purpose .    to be concrete , we begin with a general homogeneous , isotropic , and spatially flat spacetime , described by the frw metric , s^2=-t^2+a^2(t)x^2 , where @xmath5 is the distance element in flat time slice of @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "we assume this form of metric only for notational simplicity .",
    "the formalism developed here can be generalized to the cases where the conditions such as isotropy and spatial flatness are absent , and also to general @xmath7 dimensions when dimensional regularization is required . throughout the paper , we work with conformal time @xmath8 , defined through @xmath9 ,",
    "so that the metric is conformally flat , [ metriccf ] s^2=a^2()(-^2+x^2 ) .",
    "suppose we are interested in a field theory described by a classical lagrangian @xmath10 $ ] , which is a functional of several dynamical field variables @xmath11 where the superscript `` @xmath12 '' labels different fields .",
    "in general , the classical equations of motion @xmath13/\\de\\phi^a=0 $ ] in frw background have solutions @xmath14 with nontrivial time dependence , among which the frw metric itself is a time - dependent solution of the einstein equation . on the other hand , in most cases we are interested in solutions being constant over every given time slice @xmath15 .",
    "such solutions break spontaneously the time translation symmetry ( if there is any ) , but not the 3-dimensional translation and rotations .    to quantize the theory , we first split the fields @xmath16 into classical background @xmath17 and fluctuations @xmath18 .",
    "substituting this back into the lagrangian @xmath10 $ ] , we get a new lagrangian @xmath19 $ ] , which can be treated as a functional of fluctuations @xmath18 starting from the quadratic order .",
    "the background solutions @xmath17 , being classical @xmath20-numbers , can be viewed as time - dependent parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "therefore , we are effectively considering a lagrangian @xmath21 $ ] with field variables @xmath18 and various time - dependent coupling parameters .",
    "in particular , we will also treat the background metric ( [ metriccf ] ) as a time - dependent parameter , and therefore we do not spell it out explicitly in various formulae . for example , we write the action as s=^3x _ [ ; ] , with the factor @xmath22 considered as a time - dependent parameter in the lagrangian . from now on",
    ", we shall suppress the @xmath8 dependence in the lagrangian and simply write @xmath23 $ ] for notational clarity .",
    "but it should be kept in mind that the coefficients in the lagrangian , and also in the hamiltonian , can have nontrivial time dependence , due to the time - dependent background solutions .",
    "now we are in the position to quantize the theory . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that all of the quantum fluctuation fields @xmath24 are dynamical variables , i.e. there is no constrained variable or gauge redundancy .",
    "such complications are inessential for our presentation of sk formalism , and can be treated on the same footing with ordinary field theory . with this assumption , we can define the canonical conjugate momentum @xmath25 and the hamiltonian as usual , @xmath26}\\,}{\\pd\\varphi'^a}},\\\\ \\label{hd } \\hd[\\pi,\\varphi]=&~\\pi_a\\varphi'^a-\\ld_\\text{cl}[\\varphi],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to conformal time , @xmath27 .    at this stage",
    "it is helpful to spell out some details in more concrete examples .",
    "let s consider a lagrangian @xmath23 $ ] without higher order derivative couplings , which means that @xmath28 depends on @xmath29 at most quadratically , _ and _ that the coefficients of quadratic terms of @xmath29 are field - independent .",
    "we can parameterize such a lagrangian as , [ ld_nd ] _ =",
    "_ ab^a^b+_a()^a+ ( ) , where @xmath30 is a positive definite matrix independent of @xmath24 , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are arbitrary functions of @xmath24 and its spatial derivatives , but we do not spell out their dependence on spatial derivatives simply for convenience",
    ". we can think of @xmath30 as a metric and use it to lower the field indices , and use its inverse @xmath33 to raise indices . as we shall see below ,",
    "this is the most general case where we can derive the lagrangian version of path integral without perturbative expansion .",
    "depends on @xmath24 , it is also possible to derive a lagrangian version of path integral without perturbation expansion , but at the expanse of an additional annoying field - dependent factor @xmath34 , which still needs a perturbative treatment in diagrammatic calculations .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion . in this paper",
    ", we prefer to separate any field dependence in the `` metric '' @xmath30 into another term and treat it perturbatively . see appendix [ sec_dc ] for details . ] then , from the above lagrangian , we can compute the canonical conjugate momentum and the hamiltonian , @xmath35=&~{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{1}\\,}{2}}\\pi_a\\pi^a-\\mathcal{v}_a\\pi^a+{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{1}\\,}{2}}\\mathcal{v}_a\\mathcal{v}^a-\\mathcal{w}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the quantity we want to calculate is the expectation value @xmath36 where q()_1(,x_1)_n(,x_n )  . here",
    "@xmath37 are operators constructed locally from the field operators in the lagrangian .",
    "these operators are all on the same time slice @xmath8 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath38 is taken with respect to a state @xmath39 which is fixed at some initial time slice @xmath40 , and is usually taken to be the vacuum state with respect to time @xmath8 at @xmath40 . in this paper",
    "we are mostly interested in the case , [ qoperator ] q()^a_1(,x_1)^a_n(,x_n )  .    before introducing the schwinger - keldysh path integral , it is useful to review very briefly the way of computing @xmath41 in canonical in - in formalism , phrased in operator language .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite . according to this formalism",
    ", the expectation value @xmath41 is firstly rewritten in interaction picture , and then is recast into a dyson series , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the operator @xmath44 written in interaction picture , @xmath45 is the usual dyson series , and @xmath46 is its hermitian conjugate , i.e. , @xmath47 where t and @xmath48 represent time ordering and anti - time ordering , respectively , and @xmath49 is the interaction - picture hamiltonian , [ hint ] h_i()=^3x .",
    "the complication here is not only that one needs to do perturbative expansion of dyson series and the wick contraction by hand , but also that the coupling terms in interaction - picture hamiltonian @xmath50 are not simply the sign reverse of the corresponding lagrangian when derivative couplings are present .",
    "in fact , there may be non - negligible new terms generated in @xmath50 which are absent in the classical lagrangian @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a review . also see ( [ hpert ] ) and the subsequent discussions in appendix [ sec_dc ] of this paper for further details .",
    "now we are going to write down a path integral representation for @xmath41 starting from the heisenberg picture , where the initial state is time independent , and thus the desired quantity is simply given by , q=|q()| . in order to derive a path - integral representation of @xmath41 in a similar way as we do for @xmath2-matrix ,",
    "the first step is to recast @xmath41 into an amplitude between an in state and an out state . for this purpose",
    ", we can naturally identify @xmath39 to be the in state , but we do not know an out state .",
    "the trick out of this problem , as usual in physics , is to `` sum over our ignorance '' .",
    "that is , we choose a time slice @xmath51 at any time @xmath52 , usually just taken at @xmath53 as we shall assume in the following , and insert a complete basis of states @xmath54 on @xmath51 into @xmath41 , @xmath55 at this moment we immediately realize an ambiguity that we can insert the complete basis at many different places . for",
    "now , we stick to the prescription that we insert the complete basis to the left of all operator insertions , and we will come back later to comment on the other choices of inserting the complete basis .",
    "( for the special case where all operator insertions sitting on the final time slice @xmath51 as is considered here , the position of inserting the complete basis turns out to be irrelevant , as we shall see below . )    now , the two factors on the right hand side of ( [ qev ] ) have the desired form of an @xmath2-matrix element , and thus are amenable to path integral representation . in particular , the @xmath56 resembles the conjugation of a vacuum amplitude , with the time order of the in and out state reversed . for this reason ,",
    "we call it the anti - time - ordered factor .",
    "similarly , we call @xmath57 the time - ordered factor .",
    "to write down path integral representation for both factors , we proceed as usual , by foliating the spacetime between initial slice @xmath58 and final slice @xmath51 with infinitely many time slices , and then inserting complete eigenbasis @xmath59 of field operator @xmath24 and the complete eigenbasis @xmath60 of the conjugate momentum @xmath25 , at each slice @xmath61 .",

    "this is because in such cases , the hamiltonian ( [ hd_nd ] ) is quadratic in the momentum , and thus the path integral over momenta in ( [ qevhpi ] ) is simply a gaussian .",

    "we show in appendix [ sec_dc ] that the path integral over momentum can still be carried out perturbatively , and the result again agrees with the classical lagrangian up to 4th order in the power of fields .",
    "therefore , we shall assume from now on that ( [ qevlpi ] ) also holds for theories with higher order derivative couplings .",
    "this is an important point for cosmological application , because higher order derivative couplings appear frequently in this context .",
    "the expression ( [ qevlpi ] ) is almost in the desired form of a path integral , weighted by the exponential of an action @xmath84 , where @xmath85=\\int(\\ld[\\varphi_+]-\\ld[\\varphi_-])$ ] , except for the second line , where we have additional three factors , two inner products of states and one @xmath86-functional .",
    "the meaning of the @xmath86-functional is obvious : it tells us that the path integrals for @xmath87 and @xmath88 are to be sewn together at the final time slice @xmath89 .",
    "on the other hand , we show in the next several paragraphs that the meaning of the two inner products @xmath90 and @xmath91 is to provide the correct @xmath4-prescription for the time integral , following the treatment of @xcite . the main point is to recognize that the inner products are nothing but the vacuum wave functionals represented in field basis , and therefore , they must satisfy the defining equation for the vacuum @xmath92 , also rewritten in the field basis , where @xmath93 is the annihilation operator .",
    "therefore , the first step is to represent the annihilation operator @xmath93 in terms of field @xmath24 and its conjugate momentum @xmath25 . to be concrete , we restrict ourselves temporarily with the case of inflation , assuming the scale factor @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the hubble parameter , and the generalization to other cases should be straightforward .",
    "we further consider the lagrangian ( [ lfree ] ) of several massive scalar fields as an example , where we can take field metric @xmath96 .",
    "we assume that the interactions are switched off at asymptotic past @xmath97 , so that @xmath24 becomes essentially free fields at @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , the mode functions at past infinity ( [ upast ] ) tells that these fields are not only free but also effectively massless at @xmath98 , so they have very simple mode functions , [ umodetau0 ] u_a(_0,k)=e^-k .",

    "we see that the additional terms amount to a correction @xmath113 in the mode function ( [ umodetau0 ] ) for time - ordered variable @xmath87 , and a correction @xmath114 in the mode function for anti - time - ordered variable @xmath88 , which are further equivalent to a tiny deformation of the time direction into the complex plane , in such a way that @xmath115 for time - ordered part and @xmath116 for anti - time - ordered part . therefore , we have shown that the net effect of the two inner products is to provide the correct @xmath4-prescription for the path integral , and from now on",
    ", we shall always assume that the time integral has been deformed appropriately , and thus take the two inner products away from ( [ qevlpi ] ) .",

    "the expression itself is intuitive , which illustrates very well the three steps of writing down the sk path integral , as summarized in the following box .",
    "since the path integral ( [ lpidelta ] ) is in quite a standard form , it is routine to derive a set of diagrammatic rules for perturbative calculation , which we shall outline in next subsection . at the end of this subsection , we comment briefly on the ambiguity we mentioned below ( [ qev ] ) . from the derivations in this subsection , it is now clear that we are basically free to put field insertions @xmath118 either in time - ordered factor @xmath119 or in anti - time - ordered factor @xmath120 .",
