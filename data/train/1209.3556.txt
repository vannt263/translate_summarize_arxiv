    "the realization of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice opens up the possibility to study in a controlled way strongly correlated quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "such strongly correlated atoms are well described by the hubbard model .",
    "this model plays a central role for the study of the mott insulator ( mi ) transition  @xcite , high-@xmath2 superconductivity  @xcite , and quantum magnetism .",
    "in addition , the high controllability of model parameters such as the interaction by a feshbach resonance technique and kinetic energy by changing the lattice depth allows us to capture such hubbard physics in a broad range of parameter regimes .",
    "the recent achievement of fermi degeneracy of ultracold alkaline - earth - metal(-like ) atoms such as @xmath3ca , @xmath4sr , and @xmath1yb potentially provides a new class of strongly correlated matter .",
    "the structure of their nuclear spin degrees of freedom allows the realization of high symmetry groups for the internal degree of freedom ( `` spin '' ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath1yb atoms behave as a spin-@xmath5 fermion  @xcite and @xmath4sr as a spin-@xmath6 fermion  @xcite . in particular , provided all @xmath7-wave scattering lengths are independent of the atomic spin states , the atom cloud as a many - body system obeys high symmetries .",
    "thus the confinement of alkaline - earth - metal(-like ) atoms in an optical lattice provides opportunities for the study of the su(@xmath0 ) symmetric hubbard model for spin-@xmath8 atoms .",
    "the experimental realization of such su(@xmath0 ) hubbard models has strongly stimulated the corresponding theoretical studies  @xcite .    in condensed matter physics , the su(@xmath0 )",
    "symmetric systems have been introduced as a purely theoretical extension of the strongly correlated electron systems with su(@xmath9 ) spin rotational symmetry , e.g. , for quantum magnetism  @xcite or for the hubbard model  @xcite in the context of high-@xmath2 superconductivity  @xcite . as a theoretical tool to solve such problems , the slave - particle technique , originally developed for the single impurity anderson model  @xcite , has been used and applied to the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the slave - boson approach has also been used with success in the cold atom context  @xcite .    in this paper , we generalize the slave - boson calculation scheme introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to the symmetric @xmath0-component fermionic atom systems including su(@xmath0 ) symmetry .",
    "this technique has proven an effective way to compute the dynamics of strongly interacting systems at a filling of one or less than one particle per site in the spin - incoherent temperature regime for which the temperature is lower than the interaction energy , but larger than the magnetic superexchange one .",
    "this regime is directly relevant to the current experiments on fermionic atoms . a diagrammatic approach based on the noncrossing approximation ( nca ) with the spin - incoherent assumption",
    "is used to estimate self - energies and compute the spectral functions as functions of temperature , chemical potential , and component number @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us in particular to compare the physics for different @xmath0s .",
    "we also use these techniques to compute the effect of lattice modulation spectroscopy which has been recently implemented in experiments .",
    "the lattice modulation technique has been originally applied to bosonic atom systems , in which the absorbed energy is measured as a function of the modulation frequency  @xcite . according to the linear response formalism , the energy absorption rate in such a weak perturbation regime gives access to the kinetic - energy correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "for fermionic atoms , an accurate measurement of the absorption energy is difficult , and a variant of the probe measuring the production rate of so - called doublons , which is the number of doubly occupied sites , induced by the lattice modulation has been proposed .",
    "@xcite the doublon production rate ( dpr ) has been shown to be identical to the energy absorption rate both numerically and analytically  @xcite .",
    "this doublon measurement technique has been successfully implemented in a fermionic atom experiment  @xcite .",
    "this allowed more recent experiments to successfully reach the linear response regime for which the dpr spectrum scales quadratically with the modulation amplitude .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the hubbard model for the @xmath0-component fermions which includes su(@xmath0 ) symmetry . the introduced hamiltonian is rewritten in a slave - particle representation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : single - particle - property ] , we discuss the single particle properties based on the hubbard hamiltonian using this slave - particle representation . then , using a diagrammatic approach starting from the atomic limit , self - consistent equations of doublon and holon self - energies are constructed and solved analytically . in sec .  [",
    "sec : dpr ] , using the spectral functions given in sec .",
    "[ sec : single - particle - property ] , we investigate the dpr spectrum produced by an amplitude modulation of the optical lattice potential .",
    "then the analytic form of the dpr spectrum is given .",
    "in addition , we extend the calculation to the trapped case by using the local density approximation ( lda ) , and we also compare our results to the recent experiment with @xmath1yb atoms .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "some technical details on the formulation of the dpr spectrum are briefly reviewed in appendix  [ dprformalism ] .",
    "in lattice systems with multicomponent particles , multiparticle occupation states in addition to double occupancy can be defined in general . however ,",
    "when the interaction between different components is strong , such multiple - occupation is at a higher energy state than double occupancy . because we are interested in physics of doublon excitations at a filling of one or less than one particle per site , such higher occupation states are way above the main energy scale of interest .",
    "thus , as an effective model hamiltonian , we can extend the hubbard type two - body interaction to the @xmath0-component case",
    ". then interactions between different components , determined by the @xmath7-wave scattering lengths , generally take different values depending on the components : the interaction parameter is written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the indices characterizing the internal state of the fermions .",
    "we consider the special case of a unique interaction parameter , @xmath15  @xcite ; namely the coupling does not depend on the components .",
    "yb atoms , which are spin-@xmath5 fermions , all two - body interactions are the same . ]",
    "then , the interaction term has the same symmetry as the kinetic term , and the system symmetry turns out to be enlarged to su(@xmath0 ) symmetry .",
    "we consider the generalized @xmath0-component fermionic hubbard model , @xmath16 with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the annihilation operator of a fermion with the internal component @xmath13 at a site @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the number operator . the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , denote the nearest - neighbor hopping energy and the on - site interaction between components @xmath13 and @xmath14 . throughout this paper , we consider only the repulsive case @xmath23 .    in the considered regime of chemical potentials , particle - hole symmetry always disappears except for the @xmath24 case at @xmath25 .",
    "this is because for @xmath26 there are @xmath27 doublon states while the hole state is unique .",
    "the @xmath0-component fermions have a larger hilbert space than that of the two - component case : while an empty site ( holon ) is unique , there exist multiple - occupation states ( three- and four - fold occupation , and so on ) in addition to @xmath27-species doubly occupied states ( doublons ) and @xmath0-species single occupied spin states ( spinons ) .",
    "the multiple - occupation states are energetically out of shell , since those states cost an energy higher than @xmath28 , which is over the energetic cutoff in our model hamiltonian .",
    "thus in our case we describe the single - site state by a holon @xmath29 , @xmath0-species spinon @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , and @xmath27-species doublons @xmath32 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) . in terms of doublon states , the antisymmetrization condition @xmath35 is imposed .",
    "we hereafter suppose that the spin indices in @xmath32 are ordered such that @xmath36 .",
    "the single - site original fermionic operators , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are given by @xmath39 then the representation no longer gives back the anticommutation relation @xmath40 , but it should be approximately correct as long as @xmath22 is much larger than the particle hopping @xmath21 and temperature , and the filling is less than unity , which means that all the excitations leave the system in the proper subpart of the hilbert space .",
    "we introduce the creation and annihilation operators for a holon , spinons , and doublons as @xmath41 and the new vacuum state @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to extend the above single - site argument to multi - site problems : all operators become site dependent . in order to recover the anticommutation relations between the original fermions at different sites , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , we assume the following commutation and anticommutation relations : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48=\\delta_{i , j}\\delta_{\\sigma,\\sigma'}$ ] . furthermore , by imposing the following constraint we project onto the physical subspace the hilbert space enlarged by introducing the holon , spinons , and doublons : @xmath49 which means that the double occupation on the same site by the slave particles ( holon , spinons and doublons ) is forbidden .    in summary , the @xmath0-component fermion in the reduced hilbert space where the multiple - occupied states are truncated",
    "is described in slave particle description as follows : @xmath50 due to the slave - particle constraint  ( [ eq : slave_particle_constraint ] ) this representation automatically leads to the expected number operator : @xmath51 the constraint  ( [ eq : slave_particle_constraint ] ) is imposed by a lagrange multiplier method .",

    "we calculate the single - particle propagator of a holon and a doublon based on the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : slave_particle_kinetic_energy ] ) and ( [ eq : slave_particle_atomic_energy ] ) in the slave - particle representation .",
    "let us start with the atomic limit where @xmath60 .",

    "the atomic propagators of spinons and doublons have the same form regardless of their species . @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote the matsubara frequency for bosons and for fermions , respectively .",
    "we proceed with the finite- but small-@xmath21 case by making a mean - field approximation . in general , due to the effect of the hopping hamiltonian , the system becomes coherent and exhibits a long - range magnetic order . in order to see such phases ,",
    "the system should reach a temperature region lower than the magnetic and charge hopping energy scales .",
    "however , in the spin - incoherent mott physics case of interest in the present paper , both spin and charge coherence are expected to be suppressed due to thermal effects .",
    "this is a common feature of the atomic limit , but to reproduce the finite bandwidth in terms of single doublon and holon spectra it is necessary to take into account the effect of the kinetic energy @xmath55 . as a simple way to describe the spin - incoherent regime , we use the assumption , which is valid for @xmath65 ,   would become a mott insulator .",
    "the charge coherence should then be suppressed even if @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the spin - incoherent temperature regime at unity filling is @xmath67 . ] that the spinon propagation is well described by the atomic one : @xmath68 note that the atomic propagator does not have translational symmetry in general .",
    "indeed , @xmath69 includes the local potential coming from the lagrange multiplier @xmath54 , which is potentially site dependent .",
    "the mean - field treatment of @xmath54 is required to recover the translation - invariant paramagnetic background in the above framework .",
    "thus we replace the lagrange multiplier by the homogeneous one : @xmath70 then , the local potentials  ( [ eq : local_potential ] ) also become homogeneous by definition : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",

    ", the atomic limit provides the suitable physics .",

    "we can thus use the following form for the spinon propagator : @xmath81 at variance with usual mean - field theory , we include here the dynamical fluctuations .",
    "the local spin dynamics coming from the thermal fluctuation is thus retained in this approximation .",
    "let us consider the full doublon and holon propagators , based on the atomic - limit mean - field . to take into account @xmath55 at a filling of one or less than one particle per site , we use the nca  @xcite .",
    "this method gives a result similar to that from the retraceable path approximation by brinkman and rice  @xcite , and is reasonably tractable and accurate to describe the physics of single hole motion in a mi background .",
    "in addition , the nca allows for the control of the chemical potential and temperature , which means that one can extend the calculation to an inhomogeneous case by the lda .",

    "our approach is based on the slave - particle representation in which the original fermion operators are represented by a fermionic holon , @xmath0 species of bosonic spinons , and @xmath27 species of fermionic doublons .",
    "we have employed a combination of mean - field theory , a diagrammatic approach , and the nca to take into account the finite particle hopping @xmath21 , and we have captured the physics of the hole - doped systems for large interaction @xmath197 .    as an application to the calculation of the experimental observables , the dpr induced by dynamical periodic modulation of optical lattices as a function of modulation frequency has been also computed , both for the homogeneous system and for the trapped system , in an lda . as shown in the appendix , the dpr spectrum as a second - order response to the optical lattice modulation",
    "is directly related to the retarded kinetic - energy correlation function .",
    "we have discussed the dpr spectrum without vertex corrections , and we have presented the analytic form constructed by the obtained spectral functions of the doublon and the holon .    from the obtained analytic form in the case of homogeneous systems , we have obtained the dpr spectra as a function of temperature , chemical potential , and component number @xmath0 , and we have compared the different behaviors for the different @xmath0s . while the large peak structure around the interaction @xmath22 exists regardless of the value of @xmath0 , some differences have been observed in the regime of low modulation frequency . in the comparison , we have focused on two different effects leading to an enhancement of the spectral weight in the low - frequency regime .",
    "the first one is a doping effect : in going away from half - filling , the low - frequency spectrum appears as a consequence of the system becoming metallic .",
    "this effect has been found to be suppressed as @xmath0 increase .",
    "the second effect is the temperature : the spectral weight in the low - frequency side tends to increase with temperature .",

    ". therefore the properties of the spectra for different @xmath0s will be most markedly different for the low - energy part of the spectrum .",
    "the theory presented in this paper has several advantages : first , the finite - temperature dynamics can be dealt with analytically . for such dynamical correlations ,",
    "numerical approaches can not be straightforwardly applied because of the difficulty of numerical implementation of the analytic continuation ; second , our theoretical technique allows for the control of the chemical potential , in principle .",
    "note however that our approximations are expected to work well at a filling close to the mi state .",
    "this means that inhomogeneous systems in the presence of a trap potential can be also discussed by using an lda . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approach has been applied to the su(@xmath9 ) symmetric hubbard model with a harmonic trap potential , and quantitatively precise agreement with the experiment  @xcite has been obtained .    using the extension of this approach to trapped systems we have compared our results for the dpr spectra shown in fig .",

    "have been being realized in experiments with alkaline - earth - metal(-like ) @xmath4sr",
    "@xcite in addition to @xmath1yb atoms .",
    "current fermionic atom systems in such experiments are still at high temperature .",
    "therefore our theory is expected to work very effectively to compare up - coming lattice modulation experiments in such a temperature regime .",
    "finally , we would like to mention some prospects of our study .",
    "the first is to apply this technique to the calculation of thermodynamic functions such as entropy .",
    "it is hard to measure temperature directly in experiments , and the measurement of entropy is used instead .",
    "thus by computing the entropy within our theoretical framework , we can make a more straightforward comparison with the experiment .",
    "the second is to extend the theory to general @xmath0-component mixtures away from the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry limit .",
    "although the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry has been assumed throughout this paper , the slave - particle representation and the nca calculation would be still applicable away from the su(@xmath0 ) symmetric point . however , the self - consistent equations for the self - energies [ eqs .  (",
    "[ eq : holon_self - energy ] ) and  ( [ eq : doublon_self - energy ] ) ] remain complicated , and the issue would be how to solve the self - consistent equations . another prospect is to develop this technique to capture the low - temperature physics .",
    "the difficulty of the application of the present technique to spin - coherent systems is that we have here assumed fully incoherent spins .",
    "namely , the spinon propagators are replaced by the atomic propagators , which means that even nearest - neighbor spin correlations are ignored .",
    "thus the key to improve the technique for lower temperature would be to modify the spin - incoherence assumption  ( [ eq : spinon_propagator_replacement ] ) .",
    "such an improved technique would allow for the crosscheck of the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "we thank a. lobos for a fruitful discussion on the slave - particle method and s. taie and y. takahashi for valuable intensive discussions on experiments of @xmath1yb atoms .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national foundation under manep and division ii .",
    "the derivation of the dpr formula is briefly reviewed . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider the homogeneous case , but the more general case including an inhomogeneous potential such as a trap can be discussed .",
    "such a general argument can be found in ref .",
    "we start with a generic hamiltonian of interacting atoms in optical lattice potentials defined in @xmath198-dimensional continuum space , which is written as follows : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the optical lattice potential , and @xmath201 is an unperturbed hamiltonian of interacting atoms in free space .    for a deep optical lattice potential ( @xmath202 ) ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath203 is well described by the hubbard model .",
    "then the parameters , the hopping @xmath21 and on - site interaction @xmath22 , are given as a function of lattice depth @xmath204 .",
    "for example , if the wannier function is assumed to be approximated as a gaussian wave function , the hopping @xmath21 and on - site interaction @xmath22 are estimated  @xcite as @xmath205 ,   \\label{eq : hopping}\\\\   u   & \\approx   \\frac{8}{\\pi}ka_{\\mathrm{s}}e_{\\mathrm{r } }   \\left(\\frac{v_0}{e_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\right)^{3/4 } ,   \\label{eq : interaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath206 and @xmath207 are , respectively , the recoil energy and @xmath7-wave scattering length of atoms in free space .",
    "we consider an amplitude modulation perturbation of an optical lattice . for deep lattices",
    "the modulation effect of the lattice potential can be described by replacing the amplitude of the static lattice potential @xmath208 as @xmath209 $ ] .",
    "then the parameters of the lattice model also follow the replacement , and the modulation parts are derived up to first order in @xmath130 : @xmath210 ,   \\\\   j&\\rightarrow j[1+\\delta{j}\\cos(\\omega t)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath211 and @xmath212 . in the case of a gaussian wannier function  ( [ eq : hopping ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) , @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "thus the time - dependent perturbation by lattice modulation is written as @xmath215 , where @xmath216 .",
    "in addition , by making use of the form of the hubbard hamiltonian , the perturbation can be rewritten as @xmath217 , where @xmath218 .",
    "thus the considered hamiltonian with the lattice modulation is written as @xmath219    extending the doublon number projector for @xmath24 , we can define the total number operator of a doublon by the hubbard interaction as @xmath220 where we have defined the total doublon number as a total sum of all species of doublons .",
    "this projection operator  ( [ eq : dnp ] ) truncates only the empty and singly occupied state , and thus it could not count the doublon number perfectly for @xmath26 since the projected states include multiparticle occupancies of more than three such as three- and four - fold occupancy and so on . however , because such multiparticle occupations are away from the main energy scale in the case considered here , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dnp ] ) would be also identical to the total doublon number in the case of multicomponent fermions .",
    "the dpr per site is defined as a time average of time derivative of @xmath221 over a single period of modulation : @xmath222 where @xmath223 means the thermodynamic average by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian2 ] ) , and @xmath91 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "we implement second - order perturbation theory in term of @xmath224 .",
    "then we use the following mathematical trick : using eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian2 ] ) , we rewrite the total doublon number operator as @xmath225.\\ ] ] from a straightforward calculation up to second order , the terms apart from @xmath226 are found to contribute as oscillatory terms , and they cancel due to the single - period time average . thus @xmath227 can be rewritten as @xmath228 where we have used the identity @xmath229 .",
    "this is equivalent to the definition of the energy absorption rate  @xcite .",
    "this equivalence was numerically established for spin-@xmath11 one - dimensional fermions in ref .",
    "the second - order response of the energy absorption rate can be calculated by linear response .",
    "therefore one can finally obtain the formula as @xmath230 where @xmath231 is a fourier component of the kinetic - energy - retarded correlation function @xmath232\\rangle_0 $ ] where @xmath233 denotes the statistical average by the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath203 .",
