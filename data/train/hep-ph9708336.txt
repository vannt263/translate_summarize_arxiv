    "the occurrence of more or less mass degenerate states of equal spins and opposite parities in both the baryonic and the mesonic spectra @xcite has been subject of only few theoretical investigations . for example , while the nucleon and its first spin @xmath18resonance ( d@xmath7 state ) appear as singlets , the low lying spin@xmath19 resonances ( the first and second s@xmath20 and p@xmath20 states ) of opposite parities are almost mass degenerate . one possible explanation of such phenomena was given by dashen in the late sixties @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the baryon spectrum was classified according to the representations of the group su(3)@xmath21 , the direct product of the special three flavor symmetry group , and a discrete group @xmath22 , constituted by the six elements @xmath23 1 , @xmath24 , z:= exp(@xmath25 , z@xmath26 , @xmath24z , @xmath24z@xmath27 with @xmath24 being the 3space inversion operator . as long as the group @xmath22 has two one  dimensional representations that are parity singlets , and a further two  dimensional ( parity degenerate ) representation ,",
    "the baryons can be organized into parity singlets on the one side , and parity doublets on the other side .",
    "a parity doublet is then characterized by the small couplings ( denoted by @xmath28 ) of comparable size of mass degenerate resonances of opposite parities to the pion ",
    "nucleon ( @xmath29n ) channel containing singlets only . within this model",
    ", the conclusion was made that whereas the first s@xmath20 and p@xmath20 states might constitute a parity doublet , the mass degeneracy of the first f@xmath30 and d@xmath30 resonances might rather be accidental .    in the light of contemporary knowledge , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite needs further specifications , basically because of the different behavior of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the large @xmath33 limit .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that while @xmath32 is of the order @xmath34 , @xmath35 is of the order @xmath36 thus revealing more differences between the @xmath5 and p@xmath20 resonances than naively expected from a parity doublet classification . later , in accordance with an idea advocated by iachello @xcite , the existence of mass degenerate resonances of equal spins and opposite parities was attributed to the geometric structure of baryons , suggested to be supplementary to their internal color and spin  flavor structures . the assumption of an asymmetric top shape of hadrons led then to a classification of baryons according to the geometric symmetry group @xmath37 at low and @xmath38 and at high angular momenta , respectively , and to the @xmath39 symmetry for the mesonic @xmath40 string",
    ". an essential conclusion of this model is that only for an ideally spherical top shape parity duplication is exact .",
    "indeed , the symmetry group o(3 ) of such a top can be represented as a direct product of the special orthogonal group in three dimensions so(3 ) and the discrete group s@xmath41 constituted by the identity and the space inversion elements .",
    "since s@xmath41 has two one  dimensional representations corresponding to opposite parities , the so(3 ) multiplets of angular momentum @xmath42 split into natural ( @xmath43 ) and unnatural ( @xmath44 ) parity states in the full group o(3 ) . in case",
    "the hadron shape becomes deformed from a spherically symmetric to , say , an octupol one , then the geometric symmetry group changes from o(3 ) to @xmath38 and the parity duplication is no longer exact .",
    "this latter group is well known from solid state physics as the limit @xmath45 ( so called curie limit ) of the point group @xmath46 .",
    "for example , @xmath47 is the symmetry group of ch@xmath48cl where @xmath49 is the trigonal point group and @xmath50 the reflection with respect to a plane containing the cl - c molecule axis .",
    "it is well known from group theory ( compare @xcite for details ) that among the irreducible representations of @xmath39 there is a band of natural parity states appearing as singlets as well as degenerate multiplets . a comparison of the experimental baryon spectrum with this geometric nucleon model reveals , however , that some superfluous parity doublets are predicted already below 2 gev , for which no identification with physical states can be made .",
    "finally , both treatments of the baryon spectrum  @xcite and @xcite are based on nonrelativistic group symmetries and do not lead to relativistic equations of motion for baryons with higher spin .",
    "for these reasons it appears timely to re  examine the parity doublet structure of the baryonic spectrum .    in the present paper",
    "i demonstrate that the baryon spectrum below 2 gev is well explained if the spectrum generating algebra of the intrinsic orbital angular momentum of the resonances is o(4)@xmath0 su(2)@xmath1 , i.e. , the direct product of the compact orthogonal group in four euclidean dimensions and the isospin group .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "i briefly review the properties of the group so(4 ) , introduce its low lying irreducible representations , and perform the classification of the orbital angular momenta , underlying the baryon resonances below 2 gev in terms of so(4 ) . in sect .",
    "iii , i briefly sketch the development of lorentz invariant equations of motion for particles of any spin .",
    "i advocate the viewpoint that the relativistic equation of motion for the resonances has to be concluded from the projector onto the sl(2,c ) representation embedding these particles in the respective excitation spectrum . from that",
    "i conclude that the relativistic equation of motion for the baryonic @xmath51 multiplet known as the rarita ",
    "schwinger equation describes a family of the states p@xmath52 , s@xmath52 and d@xmath53 ( or p@xmath54 ) as a whole rather than , as widely used , an isolated p@xmath54 state .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary .",
    "the group o(4 ) is the direct product of the special orthogonal group so(4 ) and the discrete group s@xmath41 mentioned in the introduction .",
    "there are two different types of o(4 ) multiplets . in the first case the o(3 )",
    "members of the o(4 ) multiplets are of natural parities , while in the second case their parities are unnatural .",
    "subsequently , the so(4 ) representations will be considered in more detail .",
    "the group so(4 ) is well known to be the factor group of the chiral group su(2)@xmath56su(2)@xmath57 as the chiral algebra @xmath58 is the universal enveloping of @xmath59 . because of that",
    ", the representations of the chiral group can be mapped onto those of so(4 ) . for this reason so(4 ) transformations are sometimes called chiral. along this line , the famous so(4 ) invariant mesonic lagrangian known as the linear sigma model had been constructed by gell  mann and levy @xcite . to my knowledge , no so(4 ) invariant models for baryon excitations have been considered so far .",
    "it is the purpose of the present study to partly fill this gap .",
    "the special orthogonal group in four dimensions is the compact form of the special lorentz group so(1,3 ) . to be more general , i present here the commutation relations between the six generators @xmath60 and @xmath61 with i=1,2,3 of the non  compact group so(1,3 ) .",
    "they generate the following algebra : @xmath62 the @xmath59 algebra is simply obtained from the last equation through the replacement @xmath63 .",
    "this complexification of the so(1,3 ) algebra is sometimes called wick rotation. the irreducible representations @xmath64 of the group so(4 ) are labeled by the two numbers @xmath65 and @xmath66 that are both integer or both half  integer , and their dimensionality is @xmath67 the so(4 ) multiplets have in the so(3 ) reduction the following angular momentum content @xmath68 the irreducible representations @xmath69 of so(3 ) split within the full group o(3 ) into states of natural and unnatural parities . the natural parity",
    "states are realized in terms the spherical harmonics y@xmath70 , while the unnatural parity ( un.p . ) states are described by means of spherical pseudotensors .    in the full group o(3 ) , natural and unnatural parity states are distinguishable , while in the special group they are identical .",
    "for example , the lowest so(4 ) multiplet @xmath71 is one  dimensional and remains a singlet after the so(3 ) reduction .",
    "its parity and angular momentum content with respect to o(3 ) can be 0@xmath72 as well as 0@xmath73 .",
    "the manifest chiral symmetry o(4)@xmath55su(2)@xmath1 suggests , therefore , that all states of natural parity are paralleled by such of unnatural parity . on the other hand ,",
    "its spontaneous breaking implies the selection of the 0@xmath72 state and thus of the natural parity for the lowest o(3 ) representations .",
    "the next higher dimensional o(4 ) representation is the one with @xmath74 .",
    "this is a 4dimensional multiplet and its orbital angular momentum content in the o(4)/o(3 ) reduction can be either of natural or unnatural parity according to @xmath75 for the purpose of the present investigation i wish to introduce also two more o(4 ) representations that will play a role in the following .",
    "these are the 16plet @xmath16 , and the 36plet @xmath76 for which one finds the following o(3 ) reductions @xmath77 now , one can consider the total angular momentum @xmath78 of the baryon resonances to be generated through the coupling of a spin@xmath19 state to the o(4 ) representation @xmath79 filled with the corresponding orbital angular momentum states @xmath80 of natural / unnatural parities in accordance with @xmath81 .",
    "similar type of couplings appear , for example , in the construction of the wave functions for the excited states of the hydrogen atom .",
    "there , the spin of an electron moving within the so(4 ) symmetric coulomb potential of the proton is coupled to the corresponding coulomb multiplet with main quantum number n via with @xmath82 and @xmath42=0,1 , ... , n-1 .",
    "the parity of the hydrogen states obtained in this way is then determined by @xmath43 . in the baryon case",
    "one might imagine instead of the electron ",
    "proton system a valence quark with a di  quark in its ground state .",
    "the parity @xmath83 of a single @xmath84 resonance @xmath85 ( in the standard notation of @xcite ) is then equivalently determined in the present classification by either @xmath43 or @xmath44 depending on whether the parity of the o(3 ) state is natural or unnatural . in the present notation",
    ", @xmath86 takes the values of either @xmath87 for natural , or @xmath88 for unnatural parities .",
    "for example , while a @xmath89 multiplet of natural parity is filled with p@xmath90 , s@xmath52 , and d@xmath53 resonances , the one filled with unnatural parities would require the s@xmath90 , p@xmath90 , and p@xmath54 states .",
    "this consideration illustrates that the parity of the highest spin resonance allows to reconstruct the parity of the o(3 ) members of the @xmath4 multiplet .    for completeness",
    "it should be noted that the spin@xmath19 state has to be taken as the ( reducible ) representation @xmath91 of the group sl(2,c ) acting as the universal covering of the special lorentz group so(1,3 ) , the compact form of which is just so(4 ) .",
    "note , that combining spinor @xmath92 and co  spinor @xmath93 to a bi  spinor enables one to cover the space and time reflection transformations of the full lorentz group o(1,3 ) @xcite . within this framework",
    ", the nucleon is obviously classified according to the relativistic multiplet @xmath94 while the first excited p@xmath20 , s@xmath20 and d@xmath7 states with masses 1440 mev , 1535 mev , and 1520 mev , respectively , are organized into @xmath95 the notation @xmath96 on the lhs in eqs .",
    "( [ nucleon ] ) , and ( [ roper_group ] ) denotes a resonance with isospin @xmath97 , and spin and parity @xmath98 , respectively , while on the rhs the isospin of the multiplet is denoted by @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath100 was used to denote the mapping of the baryon states onto sl(2,c ) representations .",
    "the second p@xmath20 , s@xmath20 and d@xmath7 states with masses of 1710 mev , 1650 mev , and 1700 mev , respectively , together with the lowest p@xmath7 , f@xmath30 , d@xmath30 , and a ( still unobserved ) g@xmath101 ( natural parity ) or f@xmath101 ( unnatural parity ) resonances with masses between 1675 mev and 1720 mev can well be joined together into the relativistic sl(2,c ) multiplet @xmath102 where the upper / lower sign corresponds to natural / unnatural parity of the intrinsic angular momentum states .",
    "the parity of the spin@xmath103 resonance reveals whether or not chiral symmetry is restored at this energy .",
    "indeed , in case of a g@xmath101 state the o(4 ) 16plet would still belong to the fock space built upon the spontaneously selected vacuum of natural parity .",
    "in such a case , chiral symmetry is still in the nambu  goldstone mode . on the contrary ,",
    "the case of a f@xmath101 state would reveal the appearance of unnatural parity states and thus signal the wigner - weyl mode of chiral symmetry . in order to make a prediction for the parity of the first spin@xmath103 nucleon excitation ,",
    "a comparison of the @xmath104 and @xmath105 spectrum is quite instructive .",
    "it is easily proven that the classification scheme developed so far for @xmath106 states , applies equally well to @xmath107 resonances .",
    "first of all , each one of the two lowest p@xmath108 states at 1232 mev and 1600 mev is attached to a single representation @xmath109 the appearance of the second p@xmath108 state is of dynamical origin .",
    "for example , such a state could contain hybrid nucleon ",
    "gluon ( ng ) components @xcite .",
    "note that a second @xmath110 state of positive parity is still missing in the nucleon spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the p@xmath111 , s@xmath111 and d@xmath108 with masses 1750 mev , 1620 mev , and 1700 mev , respectively , fit into @xmath112 and all possess natural parities .",
    "the next isoquadruplet excitations p@xmath111 , s@xmath111 , d@xmath108 , together with p@xmath108 , f@xmath113 , d@xmath113 and the f@xmath114 resonances with masses ranging from 1900 mev to 1950 mev are well organized into the o(4 ) 16-plet of parity @xmath115 where they are obtained in coupling a spin-@xmath19 state with orbital angular momenta @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , respectively ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the positive parity of the spin@xmath103 @xmath107 state indicates unnatural parities for the states of the 16plet .",
    "now , it seems natural to assume the existence of a f@xmath101 state that parallels the f@xmath114 resonance and thereby to predict unnatural parities for the states of the nucleon 16plet , too . in doing so",
    ", the second nucleon s@xmath20 resonance at 1650 mev acquires importance as a would - be parity partner of the nucleon .",
    "the notion of a would be parity partner to the nucleon for a s@xmath20 state was first introduced in @xcite in connection with the parity degeneracy of baryons above the critical temperature for chiral transitions following from lattice qcd calculations of the hadron screening length . there , the nucleon ",
    "mass splitting was generated through the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking within the framework of an appropriately extended @xmath118 model .",
    "within such a scenario ( see @xcite and references therein ) the nucleon  s@xmath20 transition was predicted to be a first order chiral phase transition . in @xcite",
    "it was the first s@xmath20 state that was considered as the would - be parity partner of the nucleon .",
    "in using the width , mass and coupling constant to the @xmath84 channel of that state , the initial ( @xmath119 ) and final ( @xmath120 ) densities of the chiral phase transition in nuclear matter where predicted as 3.1@xmath121 and 6.4@xmath121 , with @xmath121 being the normal matter density , respectively .    from the sl(2,c ) baryon classification follows that the first s@xmath20 resonance can not be viewed as the parity partner of the nucleon because it belongs to a relativistic representation built upon the spontaneously selected vacuum of natural parity . following the arguments given above",
    ", the baryon spectrum below 1.6 gev is still in the nambu ",
    "goldstone mode of chiral symmetry . on the contrary ,",
    "the second s@xmath20 state was shown to belong to a relativistic multiplet built upon a vacuum state of unnatural parity .",
    "for that reason , the parameters of the n(1650 ) state have to enter the calculation of the critical matter density of the chiral phase transition for baryons . since the second s@xmath20 is much stronger coupled to the @xmath84 system than the first one , the resulting changes of @xmath119 and @xmath120 might be substantial .",
    "as long as the classification of the baryon resonances according to the above sl(2,c ) representations is the only way to understand the evident concentration of states within comparatively narrow mass regions in relation to their spin and parities , the chiral symmetry restoration for nucleons is expected to take place in the region around 1700 mev .",
    "correspondingly , for @xmath107 s the chiral phase transition will take place at about 1900 mev .    finally , the third p@xmath20 , s@xmath20 and d@xmath7 states with masses of 2100 mev , 2090 mev and 2080 mev , respectively , the second p@xmath7 , f@xmath30 , d@xmath30 , and g@xmath101 resonances in turn placed at 1900 mev , 2000 mev , 2200 mev , and 2190 mev together with the first f@xmath101 , h@xmath122 , g@xmath122 and a further ( still unobserved ) spin@xmath123 resonances with masses ranging from 1990 mev to 2250 mev can be joined together into the following representation @xmath124 thus a new spin@xmath125 state is predicted near 2200 mev . in order to make a prediction for the parity of the latter state , again a comparison between the @xmath104 and @xmath105 36plets is useful .",
    "the full baryon particle listing in ref .",
    "@xcite shows , unfortunately , that the @xmath107 states from that mass region are still less known .",
    "nonetheless , there is a well established h@xmath126 state at 2420 mev that indicates that the observed 36plet is filled by o(3 ) states of unnatural parity .",
    "therfore , it is natural to assume the spin@xmath125 nucleon resonance to be a h@xmath127 state , thus confirming the chiral symmetry restoration above 1.6 gev .",
    "furthermore , the sl(2,c ) classification scheme predicts three new isoquadruplet states above 2000 mev .",
    "these are the p@xmath111 , p@xmath108 , and d@xmath108 state ( see table 2 ) .",
    "comparison of the empirical baryon spectrum @xcite with the above classification scheme shows that all known non  strange baryon states below ( and around ) 2 gev are well organized into sl(2,c ) representations .",
    "the maximal mass splitting between two states within such a multiplet is about 90 mev in the first nucleon resonance family , and about 70 mev in the second family . for the @xmath107",
    "resonances these splittings are 130 mev and 50 mev , respectively .",
    "the splitting within the sl(2,c ) multiplets is significantly smaller relative to the gaps of about 200 mev between the averaged masses of the resonance groups and might be attributed to spin dependent forces . above 2 gev , the sl(2,c ) classification scheme seems violated more strongly with increasing mass and angular momentum . within the third nucleon and @xmath107 resonance families the mass splitting reaches 350 mev , and 270 mev , respectively . despite of that ,",
    "these resonances form also well pronounced multiplets .",
    "i would like to note in passing that the classification scheme developed in the present work applies also to the @xmath128 hyperon spectrum ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . there , the isoscalar s@xmath129 , d@xmath130 , and p@xmath129 states with masses from 1400 to 1600 mev fit into the @xmath131 isosinglet representation .",
    "however , the mass splitting within the multiplet members is about two times larger as compared to the non  strange baryon sector . above 1600 mev",
    ", the excitation spectrum of the @xmath128 hyperon follows the pattern of the @xmath38 symmetry of ref .",
    "@xcite rather than those of sl(2,c ) .",
    "all sl(2,c ) representations constructed in eqs .",
    "( [ roper_group ] ) , ( [ second_group ] ) , and ( [ third_group ] ) are reducible . as long as the projectors onto these representations are well known , writing relativistic equations of motion for the nucleon and its excited states becomes a well defined mathematical scheme .",
    "examples for this are given in the present section .",
    "the representation theory of the lorentz group @xcite is a well established mathematical tool for obtaining equations of motion for particles of any spin .",
    "first of all one has to find in the rest frame the representation to which the particle under consideration belongs .",
    "to be specific , let us consider a @xmath132 multiplet .",
    "the representation @xmath133 with @xmath134 and @xmath135 defines the spinor @xmath136 while @xmath137 introduces the co  spinor @xmath138 .",
    "particles with higher spin are then described in terms of spinor tensors ( @xmath139 ) of higher rank .",
    "for example , the spinor content of the vector representation @xmath9 is @xmath140 with @xmath141 and @xmath142 . especially , one gets the following correspondences @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 stand for the components of the spinor @xmath146 while @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the respective components of the complex conjugate spinor .",
    "having fixed the representation of interest , one has to find the ( 2@xmath65 + 1)@xmath55(2@xmath66 + 1 ) matrices @xmath149 that carry out the boost transformation @xmath150 from the rest frame to the system where the particle is moving with momentum @xmath151 .",
    "finally , the matrix representation of the 3space inversion @xmath24 has to be incorporated too .",
    "for example , to describe the space ",
    "inversion , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 in eq .",
    "( [ quaternion ] ) , the spinors must transform into co  spinors by means of an off  diagonal unit matrix denoted by @xmath154 according to : @xmath155 the latter equation shows that the reflection operation in 3space becomes possible only within the direct sum of the spinor and co  spinor spaces . all together , the projector onto @xmath132 is expressed as @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the parity of the vacuum . as is seen from the non  diagonal form of the matrix @xmath154 in eq .",
    "( [ reflection ] ) , the spinors are mixed  parity states .",
    "because of that , the multiplets of the lorentz group are often called helicity representations .",

    "this is exclusively due to the presence of the redundant components in the rarita - schwinger field @xmath167 that have to be eliminated by means of the subsidiary conditions mentioned above .    from the above considerations",
    "follows that the redundant states are in fact the s@xmath173 and p@xmath173 resonances .",

    "schwinger equation is not quite adequate for describing the @xmath107(1232 ) and @xmath107(1600 ) resonances .",

    "the appeal of the classification of the baryon excitations according to the representations of the group sl(2,c ) , the universal covering of the lorentz group , is mainly hidden in the possibility to identify the relativistic equations of motion for baryons of higher spin with the projectors onto the representations considered .",
    "it was shown that the 16dimensional rarita - schwinger field describes the family of s@xmath173 , @xmath179 , and d@xmath180 ( or p@xmath180 ) as a whole rather than , as widely used , an isolated spin@xmath172 state .",
    "i wish to thank florian scheck and hartmuth arenhvel for the critical reading of the manuscript and several instructive remarks as well as siddhartha sen and andreas wirzba for interest",
