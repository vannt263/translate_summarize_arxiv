    ", we will call the pseudo - fourier method ( this choice of name will become clear shortly ) .",
    "when we calculate the deposition rate @xmath74 according to the state @xmath75 we immediately see that branches with different photon numbers @xmath66 and @xmath76 do not exhibit interference : @xmath77 using eq .",

    "a general fourier expansion of @xmath82 can be written as @xmath83 writing eq .",

    "if we ignore this constant ( its contribution to the deposition rate will give a general uniform background exposure of the substrate , since it is independent of @xmath35 ) we see that we need @xmath86 with @xmath80 positive , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 real . expanding the left - hand side and equating terms in @xmath90 and @xmath91 we find @xmath92 this is essentially a co - ordinate change from cartesian to polar co - ordinates .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ fourier ] ) is equivalent to a fourier series up to an additive constant .",
    "since in the limit of @xmath93 a fourier series can converge to any well - behaved pattern @xmath94 , this procedure allows us to approximate arbitrary patterns in one dimension ( up to a constant ) .",
    "it is now clear why we call this procedure the pseudo - fourier method .    however , there is a drawback with this procedure .",
    "the deposition rate @xmath30 is a positive definite quantity , which means that once the substrate is exposed at a particular fourier component , there is no way this can be undone . technically , eq .  ( [ fourier ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the uniform background ` penalty exposure rate ' @xmath97 we mentioned earlier .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side is a true fourier series .",
    "thus in the pseudo - fourier method there is always a minimum exposure of the substrate .",
    "ultimately , this penalty can be traced to the absence of interference between the terms with different photon number in eq .",
    "( [ phot ] ) .",
    "next , we will investigate whether our second method of tailoring patterns can remove this penalty exposure .",

    "the superposition method is far more complicated , but seems to get around the background exposure .",
    "before we make a comparison between the two methods we will discuss the creation of ` arbitrary ' patterns .",
    "it is well known that any sufficiently well - behaved periodic function can be written as an infinite fourier series ( we ignore such subtleties which arise when two functions differ only at a finite number of points , etc . ) . however",
    ", when we create patterns with the pseudo - fourier lithography method we do not have access to every component of the fourier expansion , since this would involve an infinite number of photons ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "this means that we can only employ truncated fourier series , and these can merely approximate arbitrary patterns .",

    "we distinguish two methods : the pseudo - fourier method and the superposition method .",
    "the pseudo - fourier method is conceptually easier since it depends on fourier analysis , but it also involves a finite amount of unwanted exposure of the substrate . more specifically , the deposition rate equals the pattern in its fourier basis plus a term yielding unwanted background exposure .",
    "the superposition method gets around this problem and seems to give better results , but lacks the intuitive clarity of the fourier method .",
    "furthermore , we do not have a proof that this method can approximate arbitrary patterns ( see sec .",

    "( [ nmk ] ) , we found that we can indeed create two - dimensional patterns with sub - wavelength resolution , but we do not have a proof that we can create _ arbitrary _ patterns .",
    "nevertheless , we might be able to create a certain set of elementary basis patterns .",
    "there are several issues to be addressed in the future .",
    "first , we need to study the specific restrictions on the substrate and how we can physically realize them .",
    "secondly , we need to create the various entangled states involved in the quantum lithography protocol .",
