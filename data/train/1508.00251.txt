    "this model is unique in the sense that the photon field receives an effective mass that is proportional to the inflaton velocity . in particular",
    ", that one helicity state of the photon obtains a negative mass leads to a spinoidal instability . as a consequence ,",
    "a wide spectrum of photons is produced during inflation efficiently enough to form a thermal bath that leads to a reheating temperature , @xmath152 , which is much higher than the perturbative reheating temperature , @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated the density power spectrum induced by the backreaction of the photon production on the inflaton fluctuations . using the bound on the density power spectrum coming from the formation of primordial black holes ,",
    "we have derived a more stringent upper limit @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , a strong coupling can produce high density spikes in the density power spectrum near the end of inflation that may form primordial black holes .",

    "<S> a numerical study of a pseudoscalar inflation having an axion - photon - like coupling is performed by solving numerically the coupled differential equations of motion for inflaton and photon mode functions from the onset of inflation to the end of reheating . </S>",
    "<S> the backreaction due to particle production is also included self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this particular inflation model realizes the idea of a warm inflation in which a steady thermal bath is established by the particle production . in most cases </S>",
    "<S> this thermal bath exceeds the amount of radiation released in the reheating process . in the strong coupling regime </S>",
    "<S> , the transition from the inflationary to the radiation - dominated phase does not involve either a preheating or reheating process . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , energy density peaks produced near the end of inflation may lead to the formation of primordial black holes . </S>"
