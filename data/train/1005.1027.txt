    "@xmath0-differentiability as introduced by lecam and hjek appears to be the most suitable setup in which to derive such key properties as _ local asymptotic normality _ ( lan ) in local asymptotic parametric statistics . in order to show this @xmath0-differentiability",
    "however , lebesgue densities of a central distribution are frequently assumed right from the beginning . in this paper",
    ", we generalize ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.2 ) from one - dimensional location to a large class of parametric models , where these lebesgue densities are in fact a consequence of a finite fisher information of the model , provided a suitable definition of the latter is used .",
    "this definition may then serve  again as in @xcite  as starting point for minimizing fisher information along suitable neighborhoods of the model .",
    "+ the framework in which this generalization holds covers smooth parametric group models as to be found in @xcite , but is valid even in a somewhat more general setting : the idea is to link transformations in the parameter space to transformations in the observation space .",
    "+ the new definition of fisher information then simply amounts to transferring differentiation in the parameter space to differentiation  in a weak sense  in the observation space .",
    "this is actually done much in a sobolev spirit , working with generalized derivatives .",
    "after an introduction to the setup of smooth parametric group models , in section  [ setup ] , we list the smoothness requirements for the transformations and some notation needed for our theorem . before stating this theorem , in section  [ exasec ] we first give a number of examples to which this theorem applies ,",
    "the most general of which is the multivariate location and scale model from example  [ kls ] .",

    ", we show that in the ( multivariate ) location - scale model finiteness of fisher information is equivalent to @xmath0-differentiability as well as to a lan property .",
    "finally , in section  [ mini ] we generalize huber s proofs for existence and uniqueness of a minimizer of fisher information to our situation .",
    "the proofs are gathered in appendix section  [ proofs ] ; the proof of theorem  [ dasthm ] makes use of the notions of absolute continuity in @xmath1 dimensions and of weak differentiability . both are provided in an appendix in section  [ app ] .    the one - dimensional scale model , a particular case of what is covered by this paper , has been spelt out separately , in a small joint paper with helmut rieder , cf .  @xcite .",
