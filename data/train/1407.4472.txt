    "observations of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) at redshifts greater than @xmath7 @xcite has led to difficulties in understanding how such large objects could have formed so early in the universe .",
    "the most obvious route is via a population iii ( pop iii ) star which after its initial stellar evolution , collapses and forms a stellar mass black hole which can then grow to become a smbh by a redshift of @xmath8 .",
    "however , a number of authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that this scenario suffers from several severe limitations .",
    "most pertinent is the fact that in order for a stellar seed black hole to grow to a supermassive size by a redshift of @xmath9 it is necessary for the seed to grow at the eddington limit for almost the entire time . +",
    "a compelling solution is to start with a significantly larger seed mass than the mass now advocated for the first stars .",
    "recent simulations of pop iii collapse has put their mean mass at below @xmath10 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "if instead we start with a much larger seed mass the restrictions on the growth rate are eased significantly .",
    "the so - called direct collapse model leads to initial masses of between @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath3",
    ". initial work on the method began with pioneering work by @xcite and @xcite who considered the direct collapse of gas into a massive black hole seed that could then power the quasars observed at high redshift .",
    "further work in recent years @xcite has led to a growing appreciation that the direct collapse method is a viable alternative .",
    "+ in order to create the conditions in which a massive seed may form , a halo that can support atomic hydrogen cooling , having a virial temperature @xmath13 k , is required which is free of metals , dust and @xmath0 .",
    "metals , dust and @xmath0  would enhance cooling to the point where the gas would fragment into small clumps and eventually form a star of mass less than @xmath14 @xmath3 . at early times in the universe",
    "we expect the contribution from both metals and dust to be negligible , @xmath0  can however readily form in regions of moderate to high gas density .",
    "+ a large seed mass can only form if the corresponding jeans mass of the collapsing object remains high .",
    "this can be achieved if the gas temperature stays close to the virial temperature of the halo , cooling by neutral hydrogen allows the gas to cool to approximately @xmath15 and facilitates the collapse to a large seed mass . early numerical work by @xcite and @xcite showed that in the absence of @xmath0  the gas could cool isothermally and collapse to form a disk - like structure with a mass of a few times @xmath11 @xmath3 , which could then go on to form a super - massive star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a quasi - star @xcite , or a dense stellar cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "+ in assuming the absence of @xmath0  previous studies have generally assumed that the @xmath0  can be efficiently dissociated by a nearby source peaking in the lyman - werner ( lw ) band ( 11.2 - 13.6 ev ) .",
    "lw photons dissociate @xmath0  by exciting electrons to higher energy levels resulting in the breakup of the molecule .",
    "a number of authors have examined such a scenario , both using semi - analytic models @xcite and using numerical simulations @xcite . however , in all of the above numerical work the authors have assumed an isotropic background . at high redshift when local sources dominate over the lw background , this is likely to be an incorrect assumption given the highly anisotropic nature of early structure formation and the evidence accumulated for a extended period of reionisation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ in this paper we instead model a highly anisotropic source , ignoring the effects of a possible isotropic lw background .",
    "we place a source at a distance of 3 kpc from a collapsing mini - halo and turn the source on before the mini - halo collapses due to @xmath0  cooling .",
    "we ignore the effect of a lw background and instead concentrate on the effect of the nearby source only , the high redshift of the collapse ( @xmath16 ) means that any lw background at this redshift is likely to be patchy .",
    "previously , @xcite and @xcite considered local @xmath0  self - shielding effects , which is intrinsically an integrated property and should depend on the non - local environment .",
    "improving upon this local approximation , we use ray - tracing to calculate the dissociating effects of a lw source self - consistently .",
    "we run several realisations , using the same halo in each case but varying the flux intensity .",
    "the goal of this work is to analyse the effect of an _ anisotropic _ source on the formation of a massive black hole seed and to determine the intensity of the _ anisotropic _ flux required to ensure the halo remains @xmath0  free .",
    "the model simulates the effect of a close halo pair , believed to be required to provide the necessary lw flux @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is laid out as follows : in  [ sec : numericalsetup ] we describe the numerical approach used , in  [ sec : j21 ] we relate the flux from an anisotropic flux to that from an isotropic field , in  [ sec : results ] we describe the results of our numerical simulations , in  [ sec : isotropic ] we compare our anisotropic results against simulations using an isotropic radiation field , in  [ sec : discussion ] we analyse the results and in  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a standard @xmath17cdm cosmology with the following parameters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* based on the latest planck data ) , @xmath18 = 0.6817 , @xmath19 = 0.3183 , @xmath20 = 0.0463 , @xmath21 = 0.8347 and @xmath22 = 0.6704 .",
    "we further assume a spectral index of primordial density fluctuations of @xmath23 .",
    "+    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "finally , we wish to compare , as best as possible , the effect of an isotropic radiation field versus an anisotropic radiation field . we make the comparisons in figure [ isotropic ] and figure [ isotropicproj ] . as done throughout this paper outputs are compared when the simulation reaches the highest refinement level .",
    "fundamentally , the isotropic field means that each cell `` feels '' the same radiation whereas with the anisotropic source the intensity varies as @xmath24 in the optically thin regions and according to equation [ db37 ] in the optically thick regions .",
    "we ran a number of simulations , with an isotropic background and using the same halo as was used throughout this study in order to compare the results .",
    "furthermore , we included a local approximation to calculate the @xmath0  column density in each cell and used that value to estimate the self - shielding factor due to @xmath0 . in order to calculate the local estimate of the @xmath0   column density we use the sobolev - like method @xcite to estimate the column density . in this case",
    "the characteristic length is obtained from @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gas density .",
    "this particular method has been shown by wg11 to be particularly accurate in estimating the column density locally . the self - shielding approximation is then implemented in the same fashion as in the ray - tracing simulations , i.e. using equation [ db37 ] .",
    "+ the solid blue line in figure [ isotropic ] uses an isotropic background radiation field with @xmath27 and no @xmath0  self - shielding .",
    "the solid green line uses a lower intensity field with @xmath28 but this time @xmath0   self - shielding is included .",
    "the solid black line uses a higher intensity field with @xmath29 and with @xmath0  self - shielding included . for comparison the results from simulations 1054 ( dashed green line ) and 1056 ( dashed black line )",
    "are also included .",
    "the dashed lines should therefore be compared with the solid lines of the same color . in all cases the radiation field",
    "is switched on at a redshift of @xmath30 .",
    "we specifically picked isotropic backgrounds with intensities of @xmath28 and @xmath29 so as to match closely the values simulations 1054 and 1056 reach at the point of maximum density ( i.e approximately 3 kpc from the radiation source ) - see also left panel of figure [ j21 ] .",
    "+ from figure [ isotropic ] it is clear that the case with an isotropic source and no self - shielding is clearly different , the @xmath0  reaches a maximum value of @xmath31 at the core of the halo , this differs from the self - shielded cases by approximately two orders of magnitude and reflects the dramatic effect of self - shielding in the core of the halo .",
    "+ in comparison the self - shielded cases all reach the @xmath0  equilibrium value of @xmath32 within about 0.5 parsecs but their values at larger radii show significant scatter .",
    "for example , comparing simulation 1056 with the isotropic radiation field @xmath33 ( which should be approximately equal at the center of the halo ) , we see that at radii greater than about 1 parsec the @xmath0   fraction differs by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "similar differences are seen when comparing the isotropic field of @xmath34 with the anisotropic simulation 1054 .",
    "+ for the two anisotropic cases shown in figure [ isotropic ] the anisotropic source causes a delay in the build up of the @xmath0  towards the center compared to the isotropic case . the strength of the fluxes of the anisotropic and isotropic cases were chosen to match at the center of the halo , however the strength of the anisotropic flux increases as one moves towards the radiation source compared to the isotropic case .",
    "this is why in the anisotropic case the @xmath0  fraction is significantly lower in the outer parts ( even though this is a radial profile - the destruction of @xmath0  along the line of sight is even more extreme ) .",
    "the isotropic case has no such gradient in the flux and as a result the @xmath0  fraction is systematically higher at all radii outside the core .",
    "these differences in @xmath0  will dramatically effect the cooling rates at radii all the way into the core , and most pertinently within the envelope , and hence the entire morphology and dynamics of the collapse .",
    "+ in figure [ isotropicproj ] we compare in projection the central 10 pc region of the 1054 case with the comparable isotropic field strength @xmath34 .",
    "the projections are quite clearly very different which should not be surprising given the very different radiation field attributes in each case .",
    "in this study we have looked at the effect that a single @xmath0  dissociating source has on the collapse of a halo .",
    "in particular we are interested in whether a single source can keep a halo sufficiently @xmath0  free so that a direct collapse black hole seed may form . using a suite of simulations with varying source intensities",
    "we show that while @xmath0  is rather easily dissociated in the outer regions , within approximately a 10 parsec distance of the forming halo the @xmath0  formation rate greatly exceeds the @xmath0  dissociation rate and @xmath0  forms readily .",
    "the formation of @xmath0  is caused by the strong increase in the hi density as the gas collapses , which combines with h@xmath35 to form @xmath0  ( h@xmath35 + h @xmath36 @xmath0  + e ) .",
    "however , as the source flux is increased the amount of @xmath0  that can collapse is significantly reduced . in figure [ phaseplots ]",
    "we show the @xmath0  number density as a function of both the enclosed gas mass and the temperature . in simulation 1052 , where the source flux is relatively small , the halo achieves atomic cooling status but the @xmath0  at the center is nonetheless able to strongly self - shield and a large mass of @xmath0  is able to form and collapse .",
    "this can be set in contrast to the situation in simulation 1058 . in this case",
    "the lw flux is extremely strong , the halo is clearly able to collapse isothermally except for a small amount of gas at very high @xmath0  density which is able to collapse and cool to below @xmath37 .",
    "the mass of this cool gas @xmath38 is of the order of 100 @xmath5- at least an order of magnitude below the mass of cool gas that is seen in simulation 1052 .",
    "+ it is clear from the preceding analysis that a very strong lyman werner flux is required to reduce significantly the ability of @xmath0  to form .",
    "moreover , even with a source flux of @xmath39 photons emitted per second in the lw band ( equivalent to a j of @xmath40 ) @xmath0  is still able to form within the central parsec and a cold clump of gas with mass @xmath41 @xmath5is able to form .",
    "however , the envelope , with a radius of @xmath42 parsecs is also close to gravitational instability and prone to collapse with a mass of about @xmath43 @xmath5resulting in the likely formation of a massive black hole seed .",
    "+ the final fate of the central objects subject to an anisotropic lw flux of _ less than _ @xmath44 would appear to be the formation of a massive star with a mass of between @xmath45 @xmath5and @xmath46 @xmath5- typical of pop iii star formation simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the flux , in the lw band , is increased to values _",
    "greater than _ @xmath44 the mass of the collapsing object will grow as the jeans mass is increased due to the declining levels of @xmath0 and an increase in the mass accretion rate ( see bottom right panel of figure [ fourpanelplot ] ) .",
    "our study suggests that while very strong lw fluxes from an anisotropic source can not completely prevent the formation of @xmath0  in the central regions it can reduce its impact , with the collapsing @xmath0   core being very much smaller and the envelope becoming gravitationally unstable within a similar timescale .",
    "the collapsing total mass in this case having a mass of @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "+ in should also be noted that the values of the fluxes shown here are likely to be upper limits as our simulations have not included the effect of photodetachment of the @xmath47 ion due to the lower energy photons .",
    "the photodetachment of @xmath47 will remove the pathway for @xmath0  formation in the core and therefore reduce the @xmath0  formation rate .",
    "this of course must also be set against the effect of x - rays and cosmic rays @xcite which will enhance the @xmath0  fraction .",
    "however , the detailed balance between these two feedback processes is unclear and will depend sensitively on an as yet undetermined pop iii initial mass function(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". further work with a more comprehensive stellar spectrum and a greater sample of halos will help to further elucidate the issue ( regan et al .",
    "2014c in prep ) .",
    "+ two further numerical limitations of our method concern the @xmath0  collisional dissociation rates and our minimum dark matter particle mass .",
    "the @xmath0  collisional dissociation rates used in this paper are those of @xcite .",
    "there is some uncertainty in literature regarding the most appropriate collisional dissociation rate to use with different dissociation rates differing by up to an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "our minimum dark matter particle mass is @xmath48 @xmath3 . `",
    "enzo  ` does not refine the dark matter particles during the collapse and so this exists as a numerical limitation of our method",
    ". we will investigate the limiting effects of both of these points in a future study .",
    "+ in  [ sec : j21 ] we noted that an effective stellar temperature of @xmath49 k is required to produce a spectrum which peaks in the lw bands .",
    "we have since determined that the flux in the lw band required to effectively dissociate @xmath0  is _",
    "_ @xmath50 photons per second .",
    "a star with an effective stellar temperature of @xmath49 k will produce approximately @xmath51 photons per second in the lw band .",
    "therefore , a galaxy with a greater than @xmath52 massive stars will be required to produce such a spectrum . in the early universe , where a tilt towards a top - heavy imf is expected ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) such a scenario is entirely plausible within biased regions with close halo pairs @xcite .",
    "+ the accretion rates found in this study are @xmath53 @xmath5@xmath6 , these rates are consistent with the accretion rates found by @xcite and are furthermore consistent with the rates derived by @xcite in which they determine the properties of the hosting haloes and the mass distribution function of the forming seed black holes .",
    "they find that the initial mass function ( imf ) of the seed black holes is bimodal extending over a broad range of masses , m @xmath54 @xmath3 .",
    "this value for the imf is consistent with the value we find for the final mass of the collapsing object .",
    "+ finally , at the high redshifts probed in this study ( @xmath55 ) supersonic baryonic streaming velocities @xcite are a further possible mechanism which can affect the formation of a direct collapse black hole .",
    "recent work by @xcite has shown that relative baryonic streaming velocities may induce direct collapse black holes by minimizing metal enrichment and enhancing turbulent effects within a collapsing halo promoting the creation of cold accretion filaments .",
    "the cold filaments can drive accretion rates and lead to the formation of a direct collapse black hole . 3d",
    "hydrodynamical simulations presented by @xcite also supports this scenario at very high redshifts .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that in such a scenario the formation of @xmath0  is very difficult to prevent in the absence of a strong , nearby , lw source .",
    "their numerical simulations show that streaming velocities can not result in densities high enough to allow the halo to reach the `` zone of no return '' and conclude that this pathway is not a viable mechanism for direct collapse black hole formation .",
    "we have not included the effect of relative streaming velocities in our calculations and based on the previous findings we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our conclusions .",
    "we use the radiative transfer module in ` enzo  ` to track lw photons as they are emitted from a source approximately 3 kpc from a collapsing halo at very high redshift ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we include only the dissociating effects of this anisotropic source neglecting any effect from a global lw background .",
    "we run a number of simulations with the only difference between each run being the lw source flux intensity .",
    "+ our results show that as the dissociating flux is increased beyond the expected global average at high redshift ( @xmath57 ) the collapse of the halo is delayed significantly and the primary means of cooling the gas is due to hi . the lw flux initially easily dissociates the @xmath0  around and within the nearby , collapsing , halo . however , in each of our simulations , even those utilizing a very strong lw flux",
    ", @xmath0  is subsequently able to form in the center of the collapsing halo due to the rapid increase of hi ( which combines with @xmath47 to form @xmath0  ) .",
    "the collapse is initiated by hi cooling but as the density of hi increases driving the formation of @xmath0 the fraction of @xmath0  increases rapidly in the very central regions of the collapsing object .",
    "the amount of @xmath0  which is able to form is inversely proportional to the source flux intensity .",
    "+ with low source fluxes of @xmath58 photons per second a significant mass is able to become self - gravitating due to @xmath0  cooling .",
    "however , as the source flux intensity is increased the @xmath0  that is able to form at the center , due to self - shielding , decreases significantly but can not be entirely prevented .",
    "the formation of @xmath0 at the centers of the halos , even in the presence of a very strong dissociating lw source is therefore inevitable .",
    "+ our study also reveals that the envelope , with a mass of @xmath59 @xmath3 , is showing strong signs of collapse over a similar timescale as the core of @xmath0  cooled gas . in the halos subject to a flux of _ greater than _",
    "@xmath60 photons per second , only the inner parsec contains significant amounts of @xmath0 amounting to at most @xmath61 @xmath5of @xmath0 .",
    "this rather small mass is surrounded by a much larger collapsing mass at higher temperatures ( due to hi cooling ) .",
    "this envelope is undergoing rapid collapse at the end of the simulation , with accretion rates of @xmath4 @xmath5@xmath6 , and is already forming a well defined disk with a mass of @xmath2 @xmath5which is rotationally supported with a strong radial inflow .",
    "+ the formation of this rotationally supported disk is similar in appearance to previous work carried out where @xmath0  cooling was either neglected @xcite or where @xmath0  formation was strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed , using very high resolution simulations , that the envelope may fragment into star - forming clumps surrounding a central black hole seed .",
    "this fragmentation could lead to a dense star cluster which may undergo core collapse to form a massive black hole seed @xcite or the clumps may subsequently merge with the forming protostar to form a supermassive star @xcite . + our goal was to investigate the effect of an anisotropic source flux on the formation of a possible black hole seed .",
    "our simulations show that for an anisotropic source at high redshift a rather high source intensity is required when only lw photons are considered . arising from our study",
    "we can draw the following conclusions :    * an anisotropic source , with a lw flux @xmath62 photons per second is required to suppress @xmath0  sufficiently and allow a larger mass , @xmath63 @xmath3 , to form . *",
    "an anisotropic source , with a lw flux @xmath64 photons per second will form a clump of @xmath65 @xmath5which will collapse due to @xmath0  cooling and form a more typical pop iii star . * a flux of @xmath66 photons per second delays the collapse by up to",
    "approximately 75 myrs compared to the case where no lw source is present .",
    "stronger fluxes have little further effect on the collapse time .",
    "* accretion rates of @xmath67 @xmath5@xmath6 are found for halos experiencing strong fluxes ( @xmath68 ) photons per second in the lw band .",
    "accretion rates of this magnitude are ideal for the formation of either a supermassive star @xcite , a quasi - star @xcite or a dense stellar cluster which subsequently undergoes core collapse @xcite +    given that we have not included the effect of photo - detachment of @xmath47 due to photons in the infrared wavelength which would also suppress @xmath0  formation our results should be taken as an upper limit ; however at such high redshifts , massive stars most likely dominate the background and relatively little infrared will be present .",
    "it therefore seems likely that a single strong anisotropic source , peaking at lw frequencies , with a flux _ greater than _",
