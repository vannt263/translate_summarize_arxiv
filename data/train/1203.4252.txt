    "multiscale dynamics are ubiquitous in applications of modern science , with geophysical science and climate change prediction being well - known examples @xcite .",
    "direct numerical simulations of multiscale systems are difficult , both because a relatively short time discretization step is required to resolve fast dynamics , and due to a large number of dynamical variables . moreover , in some applications such as climate change prediction one is interested in long - term statistics of slow dynamics , which further increases computational expense .",
    "a popular approach for simulating multiscale dynamics in practice with limited computational resources is to create an approximate reduced model for slow variables alone , which allows to increase the length of the time discretization step and reduced the dimension of the phase space of the system , which is accomplished via an approximate closure of the coupling terms between slow and fast variables of the system .",
    "many closure methods were designed for multiscale dynamical systems @xcite , based on the averaging formalism for the fast variables @xcite .",
    "some methods approximate the coupling terms with appropriate stochastic processes @xcite or conditional markov chains @xcite , while others @xcite parameterize slow - fast interactions by direct tabulation and curve fitting .    in a recent work @xcite",
    "the author developed a simple approach of computing the reduced model for slow variables alone via a single computation of relevant statistics for the fast dynamics with a fixed reference state of the slow variables , using the linear fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , for the appropriately rescaled two - scale lorenz 96 model @xcite with linear coupling between slow and fast variables , the method reproduced statistics of the slow variables of the complete two - scale lorenz model with good precision .",
    "however , nonlinear coupling was not addressed in @xcite .",
    "this work is a natural extension of the method in @xcite onto quadratically nonlinear and multiplicative types of coupling in both slow and fast variables .",
    "it is also based on the linear fdt , which is used to compute the response of linear , nonlinear and multiplicative terms of the fast variables coupling to changes in the slow variables .",
    "we show numerical experiments for this method with the two - scale lorenz model and general forms of coupling which include multiplicative and quadratically nonlinear terms .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] we formulate the theory for the new method . in section",
    "[ sec : lorenz ] we present the two - scale lorenz model @xcite , rescaled in such a way that the mean states and variances of both the fast and slow variables are near zero and one , respectively @xcite . section [ sec : num ] shows the results of numerical simulations with both the two - scale lorenz model and the reduced model for slow variables only , comparing different statistics of the time series .",
    "section [ sec : sum ] summarizes the results of this work .",
    "we start with a general two - scale system of differential equations of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the slow variables , @xmath2 are the fast variables , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are @xmath5 and @xmath6 vector - valued functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the @xmath8-variables are sufficiently fast for a valid approximation of the system in by the averaged dynamics for @xmath7 , given by @xmath9 for finite times ( for a more detailed description of the averaging formalism , see @xcite ) . here , @xmath10 denotes the invariant probability measure of the limiting fast dynamics , which are given by system @xmath11 above , @xmath7 is a constant parameter , and the solution of is given by the flow @xmath12 .",
    "we tacitly assume that all typical initial conditions @xmath13 fall into the support of the same ergodic component of @xmath10 , and that @xmath14 varies smoothly with respect to @xmath7 , as it often happens when @xmath10 is an srb measure @xcite . using the ergodicity assumption for @xmath10",
    ", we can practically compute the measure average via the time average @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a long - term trajectory of .    following @xcite",
    ", here we propose an approximation to @xmath14 , based on the linear fdt . in order to do this ,",
    "certain assumptions have to be made regarding coupling , that is the dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 on the fast and slow variables , respectively . in @xcite it was assumed that @xmath3 depends linearly on the fast variables , and @xmath4 depends linearly on the slow variables ( linear coupling ) . here",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is quadratic in the fast variables in the vicinity of @xmath17 , which is the mean state of with @xmath7 set as a constant parameter : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the first and second partial derivatives of @xmath3 with respect to its second argument , respectively , and `` : '' is the element - wise ( hadamard ) matrix product with summation .",
    "the assumption of quadratic dependence of @xmath3 on the fast variables is not too restrictive for practical applications ; indeed , many real - world geophysical processes have at most quadratic dependence on velocity or streamfunction fields due to advection .",
    "now , the average with respect to @xmath10 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the covariance of @xmath23 , centered at @xmath17 .",
    "the mean state @xmath17 and the covariance @xmath22 are given by    @xmath24    @xmath25    as we can see , the average of @xmath26 with respect to @xmath10 is now expressed as a nonlinear function in the mean state @xmath17 , and linear function in covariance @xmath22 .",
    "if we know how these quantities respond to changes in @xmath7 , we can also calculate the approximation of the @xmath7-dependent average @xmath14 .",
    "now , the response of @xmath17 and @xmath22 to changes in @xmath7 can be estimated via the linear fdt .",
    "in order to obtain the response formulas , we have to impose some restrictions on the structure of @xmath27 in @xmath8 . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a @xmath6-vector nonlinear function of @xmath8 , @xmath30 is a @xmath6-vector function of @xmath7 , and @xmath31 is a @xmath32-matrix valued function of @xmath7 .",
    "again , this assumption is not too restrictive for practical applications , as only the nonlinear part of @xmath4 does not depend on @xmath7 . in this case , the limiting system in can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath7 is a constant parameter .",
    "now , let @xmath34 , @xmath35 denote the long - term averages of @xmath36 and @xmath30 over a trajectory of , so that we can write the fast limiting system as @xmath37 given the mean state @xmath38 and the mean - centered covariance matrix @xmath39 for unperturbed with @xmath40 and @xmath41 set to zeros , one can think of @xmath17 and @xmath22 as responses of @xmath38 and @xmath39 to nonzero @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "these responses can be written as linear approximations via the fdt : @xmath42 where the linear response operators @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are given by the quasi - gaussian formulas    [ eq : r_gaussian ] @xmath47{\\,\\mathrm{d}}s \\;\\sigma^{*-1}_{kj},\\ ] ] @xmath48{\\,\\mathrm{d}}s\\;\\sigma^{*-1}_{lj } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath49{\\,\\mathrm{d}}s\\;\\sigma^{*-1}_{lk } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath50{\\,\\mathrm{d}}s .",

    "the details of derivation of and are given in appendix [ sec : app_reduced ] , along with relevant references .",
    "combining with yields the approximate reduced system for slow variables alone .",
    "indeed , observe that if the averages @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the response operators @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are computed , then and , therefore , are known explicitly for given parameter @xmath7 .",

    "the model has periodic boundary conditions : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the ( mean , standard deviation ) pairs for the corresponding uncoupled and unrescaled lorenz models    @xmath63    @xmath64    with the same periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the rescaling above ensures that the lorenz model in has zero mean state and unit standard deviation for both slow and fast variables in the absence of coupling ( @xmath65 ) , and remain near these values when @xmath66 and @xmath67 are nonzero .",
    "the original rescaled lorenz model in @xcite with linear coupling corresponds to the set of parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the nonlinear coupling above preserves the energy of the form @xmath70 indeed , observe that @xmath71 at this point , one can see that @xmath30 and @xmath36 are given by @xmath72 in particular , @xmath36 is a diagonal matrix .",
    "also , @xmath73 that is , only the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix are needed .",
    "this results in @xmath43 , @xmath45 , @xmath44 and @xmath46 all being matrices rather than 3- or 4-dimensional tensors .",
    "here we show the results of numerical simulations with the new reduced model for slow dynamics of the rescaled lorenz model with nonlinear coupling in . in particular compare the numerical simulations for the three following systems :    1 .   the full two - scale rescaled lorenz system from ; 2 .   the reduced model for slow dynamics from and ; 3 .   a simplified version of with both the mean state @xmath74 and covariance matrix @xmath75 of the fast variables are fixed at their average values @xmath76 and @xmath39 , without the correction terms from ( further referred to as the `` zero - order '' system ) .",
    "the quasi - gaussian approximations in are used to compute the approximations of the coupling terms in . for the time averaging in we use long - term trajectories with averaging time window equals 10000 time units , while the correlation time window equals 50 time units ( it was observed that the time autocorrelation functions in decays essentially to zero within the 50 time - unit window for all studied regimes ) .",
    "the reference mean state @xmath38 and the covariance matrix @xmath39 are also computed by time - averaging of the full two - scale lorenz model with the same averaging window of 10000 time units .",
    "the statistics of the model are invariant with respect to the index permutation for the variables @xmath77 , due to translational invariance of the studied models .",
    "for the numerical study , we compute the following long - term statistical quantities of @xmath77 :    a.   the probability density functions ( pdf ) , computed by standard bin - counting .",
    "b.   the time autocorrelation functions @xmath78 , where the angled brackets denote the time average is over @xmath79 .",
    "these autocorrelation functions are normalized by the variance @xmath80 , so that the initial value at @xmath81 is always 1 . c.   the time cross - correlation functions @xmath82 , also normalized by the variance @xmath83 .",
    "d.   the energy autocorrelation function @xmath84 this energy autocorrelation function measures the non - gaussianity of the process .",
    "it is identically 1 for all @xmath85 if the process is gaussian ( the ornstein - uhlenbeck process being an example ) . for details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the performance of the proposed approximation of the slow dynamics depends on several factors .",
    "first , the precision will be affected by the non - gaussianity of the fast dynamics , since the quasi - gaussian linear response approximation is used for the computation of the response operators .",
    "second , the dependence of the mean state @xmath86 and covariance @xmath22 for the fast variables depends on the perturbations @xmath41 and @xmath40 is generally nonlinear , and that should also affect the precision of the approximation . here",
    "we study the behavior of the proposed approximation in variety of dynamical regimes of the rescaled lorenz model in .",
    "the following dynamical regimes are studied :    * @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( so that @xmath89 ) , so that the number of the fast variables is four times greater than the number of the slow variables . * @xmath90 .",
    "typical geophysical processes , such as the annual and diurnal cycles , have the time scale separation of roughly two orders of magnitude . * @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "the slow forcing @xmath93 adjusts the chaos and mixing properties of the slow variables , and in this work it is set to a weakly chaotic regime @xmath91 .",
    "the fast forcing @xmath94 regulates chaos and mixing at the fast variables , which are usually more chaotic and mixing than the slow variables , so it is set to @xmath92 . *",
    "this value of the coupling constant is chosen based on the previous work @xcite , where the same value was used to test the method for linear coupling .",
    "* we test a mixture of different constants @xmath96 for each coupling term .",
