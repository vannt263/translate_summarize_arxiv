    "as the number of known exoplanets continues to rise at a steady pace , their diversity appears to only increase .",
    "for instance , transiting exoplanets have allowed us to access properties of exoplanet atmospheres through observations at infra - red ( ir ) wavelengths during secondary eclipse and atmospheric absorption during primary transit @xcite .",
    "further opportunities for atmospheric studies have arisen through the detection of phase variations of such planets as hd  189733b @xcite and hd  149026b @xcite .",
    "these phase variations have also been detected for non - transiting planets , including @xmath0  and  b @xcite and hd  179949b @xcite .",
    "significant constraints have been placed on the planet - to - star flux ratio for hd  217107b through ground - based near - ir observations by @xcite .",
    "studies thus far have largely been directed towards short - period planets which are expected to have an a priori high effective temperature . in particular , this exclusivity results from a relatively high thermal flux required from the planet in order for the signature to be detectable .",
    "the exception to this is the planet hd  80606b , with a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath1 ) and a period of @xmath2 days , detected by @xcite .",
    "subsequent spitzer observations by @xcite , as well as the detection of the secondary eclipse of the planet , were used to measure the out - of - eclipse variations and estimate the radiative time constant at 8 microns . as pointed out by @xcite , ambiguous measurements of radiative time constants",
    "have prevented a consensus on expected planet - wide flow patterns for short - period planets .",
    "recent three - dimensional models of planetary atmospheres @xcite have made significant progress in deriving the underlying atmospheric physics which drive the thermal properties and zonal winds in exoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "highly eccentric planets such as hd  80606b provide a means to explore atmospheric properties in a different regime of orbital parameter space since the heating of the atmosphere during periastron passage can be sufficient to produce a detectable signal @xcite .",
    "the possability of investigating eccentric planets at optical wavelengths has previously been explored by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this observing window for periastron passage is brief and requires a reasonable understanding of the orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "this paper describes the predicted thermal changes for exoplanets in highly eccentric orbits .",
    "this study is primarily motivated from an observers point of view and is mostly concerned with planets which are not known to produce either a secondary eclipse or primary transit .",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the albedos based upon theoretical models and calculate the effective temperatures and flux ratios , taking into account the thermal heat redistribution and radiative time constant .",
    "these calculations are applied to the known exoplanets for which orbital parameters measured from radial velocity data are available .",
    "we explore the dependencies of the planetary effective temperatures on eccentricity and orbital period and determine the percentage of the orbits which are spent in their respective habitable zones .",
    "we finally calculate predicted maximum flux ratios during periastron passage , discuss the effect of spots on detections , and propose potential targets for spitzer and jwst observations .",
    "in this section we outline the basic assumptions used to calculate the planetary effective temperatures throughout the remainder of the paper .",
    "these assumptions have been deliberately introduced to be fairly broad since the intention is to encompass a variety of planets to produce a first - order approximation of the global distribution of thermal signatures and detectability .",
    "these were designed in such a way so as to produce testable limits on the flux ratios at periastron passage .",
    "we begin with the luminosity of the host star , which is approximated as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the stellar radius , @xmath5 is the stellar effective temperature , and @xmath6 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . in cases where the radius of the star is not available from direct measurements , we estimate the radius from the derived values of the surface gravity @xmath7 using the relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "as described by @xcite , we can approximate the effective temperature of a planet , @xmath10 , as a blackbody .",
    "this approximation will deviate slightly from the true temperature depending upon albedo , atmospheric properties , and internal heating .",
    "assuming that the atmosphere is 100% efficient at redistributing heat around the planet , the planetary equilibrium effective temperature is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spherical ( bond ) albedo and @xmath13 is the star ",
    "planet separation . in this case",
    "the surface is uniformly bright and thus there will be no observable phase function at infra - red wavelengths .",
    "however , if the atmosphere is inefficient with respect to heat redistribution , this will lead to a hot dayside for the planet where the effective temperature is @xmath14 where there will be a resulting phase variation as the planet orbits the star .",
    "the generalized form for the planetary effective temperature is thus @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the atmospheric heat redistribution efficiency with a value ranging between 0 and 1 .    ) and efficient ( @xmath17 ) heat redistributions .",
    "this is calculated for g0v and k5v host stars and shows that the scale of the temperature variations are dominated by the star ",
    "planet separation and not by the heat redistribution efficiency.,width=309 ]    for a typical hot - jupiter scenario , the star ",
    "planet separation is assumed to be the same as the semi - major axis , @xmath18 , since these are usually circular orbits",
    ". however , the star  planet separation for eccentric planets has the following form : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the orbital eccentricity and @xmath21 is the true anomaly .",
    "thus , the eccentricity of a planetary orbit introduces a time dependency to the effective temperature of the planet . in the absence of atmospheric effects ( see section [ atmosphere ] ) , the temperature of the planet may be examined as indicated in figure [ sepdep ] , where the dependence on star ",
    "planet separation is shown for two example spectral class targets . for a given spectral type",
    ", the difference between 0% and 100% heat redistribution efficiency can lead to a @xmath22% adjustment in the temperature calculation .",
    "however , @xmath13 is clearly dominant over @xmath16 at all separations .",
    "this means that the planetary temperature , and thus the flux ratio , is more dependent upon the orbital properties ( which are well - determined ) than on the atmospheric dynamics ( which are generally unknown ) .",
    "this is elaborated upon in the following section .",
    "here we discuss the major atmospheric properties which directly influence planetary thermal signatures .",
    "the spherical albedo of planetary atmospheres beyond the hot jupiter regime is less understood at ir wavelengths ( @xmath23  @xmath24 m ) than it is at optical wavelengths .",
    "however , the models of @xcite and @xcite indicate that the albedo drops significantly in the range between 1.0  @xmath24 m and 1.2  @xmath24 m in a manner which is relatively independent of the star  planet separation . in the case of jupiter ,",
    "the effective temperature of jupiter beyond @xmath25  @xmath24 m is @xmath26  k and the spherical albedo is @xmath27% of the geometric albedo .",
    "in addition , constraints placed upon the spherical albedos of hot jupiters ( e.g. , @xcite ) show these to be exceptionally low and in agreement with models which predict the removal of reflective cloud layers in those extreme stellar flux regimes .",
    "we thus generalize the albedo dependence on star  planet separation adopted by @xcite by scaling the relation for spherical albedos .",
    "however , here we are testing the conditions at periastron where the albedo will be minimum .",
    "this is justified by the low measured albedos mentioned above and the independent statistical verification by @xcite which favors low bond albedos for small star",
    " planet separations .",
    "the small phase amplitude of hd  189733b detected by @xcite indicates that this particular planet has very high heat redistribution efficiency caused by atmospheric advection which produces high - speed zonal winds which carry heat to the night - side of the planet .",
    "these atmospheric patterns are highly model dependent @xcite and poorly understood for planets in the short - period regime due to the small sample size and the complex interaction of planetary structure , composition , tidal effects , and incident flux .",
    "longer period eccentric orbits such as hd  80606b will further exhibit time - dependent behaviour depending upon the star  planet separation and pseudo - synchronized spin rotation ( see equation ( 42 ) of @xcite ) . a statistical study of 24 known transiting planets performed by @xcite found that there is expected to be a wide range in heat redistribution efficiencies .",
    "as described earlier , the star  planet separation is dominant over heat redistribution efficiency in determining the planetary effective temperature .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in planetary models , we consider the two extremes of @xmath28 and @xmath17 to determine the upper and lower bounds on the flux ratio for a given planet .",
    "the radiative time constant is a quantitative measure of the seasonal lag caused by the thermal response of the atmosphere to incident flux @xcite . the radiative time",
    "constant , @xmath29 is related to fundamental atmospheric properties in the following way @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pressure , @xmath32 is the surface gravity , and @xmath33 is the specific heat capacity",
    ". if @xmath34 then the incident flux is immediately re - radiated from the day - side of the planet @xcite .",
    "for example , the measured value for hd  80606b by @xcite is @xmath35  hours .",
    "the related quantity is the advective time constant , @xmath36 , which is a measure of the movement of a parcel of gas around the planet .",
    "this is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the characteristic wind speed .",
    "thus , @xmath36 approximates to zero when the wind speed becomes large , a situation which results in a high heat redistribution efficiency , as discussed in section [ heat ] .",
    "the predicted values of @xmath29 and @xmath36 are highly dependent upon the circulation models of the atmospheres @xcite and also vary with the wavelength since this effects the depth into which the atmosphere is probed @xcite . here",
    "we concern ourselves with the peak flux ratio which is expected to occur relatively close to the point of periastron passage for eccentric orbits .",
    "thus we assume that @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the subsequent calculations , keeping in mind that significant planetary spin , in addition to atmospheric composition and cloud effects , may induce wind patterns that cause divergence from this assumption .",
    "this produces an upper limit on the flux from the planetary substellar point and thus an upper limit on the predicted flux ratio with the star .",
    "the interplay between the radiative / advective time constants and other effects , such as drag mechanisms and numerical dissipation , have been investigated by @xcite .",
    "the measurable quantity from observations acquired at frequency @xmath41 is the flux ratio between the star and the planet , given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the radius of the planet .",
    "the flux ratio as a function of the orbital phase depends upon the thermal redistribution efficiency of the atmosphere . if this is 100% efficient then the flux depends purely on the star ",
    "planet separation since there is no longer a phase function such as that described by @xcite .    observations of hd  189733b and hd  80606b indicate that these planets have relatively high redistribution efficiency @xcite .",
    "these planets are in very different kinds of orbits and so this high efficiency may be quite common amongst planets which experience either constant or intermittent periods of high stellar flux .",
    "the lack of atmospheric measurements , and thus models to explain observations , for eccentric planets further motivates the need for this study .",
    "an alternative hypothetical explanation is that hot jupiters have high zonal winds and very little cloud layer , whereas eccentric planets are not irradiated in the same way and so retain some of their clouds , even during periastron passage , thus reducing the redistribution efficiency @xcite .",
    "this could lead to phase variations in the thermal signature such that planets whose periastron argument is @xmath44 become the optimal targets . discriminating between these competing ideas",
    "requires further observations to resolve .",
    "the calculations in the following sections thus represent testable assumptions which can constrain these postulates .",
    "the habitable zone ( hz ) is defined as the range of circumstellar distances from a star within which a planet could have liquid water on its surface , given a dense enough atmosphere .",
    "the various criteria for defining the hz has been described in detail by @xcite and further generalized as a function of spectral type by @xcite and @xcite . in estimating the boundaries of the hz , we utlize the equations of @xcite which relate the radii of the hz inner and outer edges to the luminosity and effective temperature of the host star . using the boundary conditions of runaway greenhouse and maximum greenhouse effects at the inner and outer edges of the hz respectively @xcite",
    ", the stellar flux at these boundaries are given by @xmath45 the inner and outer edgers of the hz are then derived from the following @xmath46 where the radii are in units of au and the stellar luminosities are in solar units .",
    "the effect of orbital eccentricity on the habitability of planets has been investigated by @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we expand upon this by using our effective temperature calculations to determine the amount of time a planet spends in the hz .",
    "there are two types of habitable zone situations we consider : planets in eccentric orbits that remain within the bounds of the habitable zone , and planets in eccentric orbits that cross the boundaries of the habitable zone . in the latter case ,",
    "the atmospheric relaxation timescales ( governed by @xmath29 and @xmath36 , described in section [ radadv ] ) may moderate temperatures even during dramatic changes in star ",
    "planet separation .",
    "note that long - period planets in circular orbits are more likely to have a non - synchronous spin rotation and so @xmath29 and @xmath36 will have a much smaller correlation with orbital period .",
    "however , planets in eccentric orbits will likely spend the majority of their orbits within the hz if apastron lies close to the outer edge , thus retaining the possability of pseudo - synchronous spin rotation .",
    "note that it is poorly understood to what degree exoplanets in eccentric orbits will retain a pseudo - synchronous spin rotation within the hz due to the many contributing factors .",
    "however , the evidence for these relative influences have been observed for moons within our own solar system @xcite .",
    "figure [ hz_orbits ] shows two example eccentric orbits overlaid on a hypothetical hz which depicts the two cases described above . in the following section , we apply these methods to determine the percentage of the orbit spent in the hz for the known exoplanets .",
    "here we calculate predicted effective temperatures and flux ratios at periastron passage for a sample of the known exoplanets for which there are known orbital solutions .",
    "the orbital parameters of 390 planets , along with the host star properties , were extracted using the exoplanet data explorer @xcite .",
    "the data are current as of 17th january 2011 .",
    "planets for which the host star values of @xmath5 and @xmath7 were not available were excluded from the sample .",
    "the calculated flux ratios are highly dependent on the assumed radii of the exoplanets ( see equation [ fluxratio ] . the anomlous radii of short - period transiting planets has been investigated by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that , for a given planetary mass and composition , planetary radii should not vary substantially between orbital radii of 0.12.0  au . however",
    ", different compostions , particularly with regards to core versus coreless models , can lead to radii variations of @xmath47% .",
    "since we are considering eccentric orbits of massive planets , we take the conservative approach of fixing the radius for each of the planets in this sample at one jupiter radius , keeping the caveats mentioned above in mind .",
    "there are a variety of current and future space - based observatories that are capable of effectively monitoring known exoplanets for thermal signatures .",
    "the irac instrument of the spitzer space telescope had passbands centered at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 microns .",
    "for the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) , planned instruments include miri which covers 5 to 27 microns , and nircam which covers 0.6 to 5.0 microns .",
    "we calculate predicted flux ratios using the 3.6 and 4.5 micron passbands of irac since the longer wavelengths are no longer available during the warm phase of the mission .",

    "included in the table are the orbital period , @xmath31 , eccentricity , @xmath20 , periastron argument , @xmath48 , the percentage of a full orbit spent in the hz , @xmath49 , and the effective temperatures and ir flux ratios assuming both low ( @xmath50 ) and high ( @xmath17 ) heat redistribution efficiencies .",
    "we also assume an albedo of @xmath51 , meaning that the planet absorbs 100% of the incident flux ( see @xcite for a more thorough statistical analysis of these values ) .",
    "this produces a higher effective temperature for the planet but is a reasonable assumption since models and measurements have shown that planets lose their reflective cloud layers at small star ",
    "planet separations @xcite . for comparison",
    ", an albedo of @xmath52 leads to a @xmath23% reduction in the planetary effective temperatures .",
    "note that flux ratios for those planets at particularly long periods are approximately zero at both passbands . however , recall from figure [ sepdep ] that the flux ratios are mostly dependent upon the star  planet separation at periastron rather than @xmath16 .",
    "thus , as one increases the orbital period and decreases the eccentricity , the change in @xmath16 becomes less important ( also demonstrated later in the top - right panel of figure [ fluxecc ] ) .",
    "the flux ratios calculated for hd  80606b are comparable to the @xmath53 values measured by @xcite at 8  @xmath24 m and indicate that there is moderate heat redistribution efficiency of the atmosphere in this case .",
    "some of the more interesting examples are discussed in detail in section [ case ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     here we discuss the two interesting cases of hd  37605b and hd  33283b .",
    "the flux ratio of hd  37605b is second only to hd  80606b amongst the eccentric planets shown in table [ fluxtable ] , aided by the short orbital period compared with its large eccentricity .",
    "this planet was also suggested as an excellent candidate for phase monitoring at optical wavelengths by @xcite .",
    "the periastron argument of @xmath54 means that a significant fraction of the day - side will be angled towards us during periastron passage .",
    "hd  33283b has a very similar predicted flux ratio , the lower eccentricity being offset by a shorter orbital period .",
    "the host stars in both cases are bright enough such that a detection of phase variations during periastron passage will yield significant information regarding the atmospheric properties of the respective planets .",
    "a lack of detectable phase variation will in turn constrain atmospheric models for these planets regarding the mechanisms for which heat distribution is occurring .",
    "provided the orbital parameters for these stars are sufficiently refined , the total time needed to achieve adequate coverage of the phase curves to maximize a detection is relatively low . shown in figure [ phasecurves ]",
    "are the calculated flux ratios at 4.5  @xmath24 m as a function of orbital phase for each of the planets .",
    "zero orbital phase is defined to occur at superior conjunction and the location of the peak flux ratio depends upon the periastron argument of the orbit .",
    "this model assumes that the atmospheres are very efficient at redistributing the heat @xmath17 which lowers the effective flux ratios .",
    "thus , these models represent a minimum expected signature from each of the planets .",
    "each of the figures contains a sub - panel which zooms in on the pericenter passage segment of the orbit .",
    "these segments can be adequately covered with 25 hours of observations , therefore only 50 hours in total would be needed to monitor both targets .",
    "the planets have the same time - coverage requirements because , although hd  37605b has a longer period than hd  33283b , it also has a larger eccentricity which increases the planetary velocity at pericenter .",
    "such targets represent rare opportunities to probe the atmospheric properties of planets beyond the regime of hot jupiters and further develop theoretical models of these planets .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the known exoplanets to determine predicted temperatures and flux ratios .",
    "this exercise is clearly not meant to serve as an exhaustive modeling of the atmospheres for each of these planets and indeed combining the models of @xcite and @xcite with ir data will present new and exciting opportunities for studying the atmospheres of eccentric planets .",
    "rather , this is meant to serve as a guide towards which of the particularly eccentric exoplanets may serve as interesting targets for follow - up observations .    for planets which lie within the hz of their host stars , eccentric planets may present additional opportunities for studying planetary atmospheres in these zones .",
    "hd  43197b and hd  156411b are particularly interesting cases since they each spend a majority of the total orbital period within their respective habitable zones but vary dramatically in the temperature differences experienced throughout their entire orbits .",
    "thus these cases may be used to investigate the effects of eccentric orbits upon habitability . based on the fact that most stellar rotation periods are",
    "are much longer than the periastron passage timescales , and that star spots typically have a signature that is much less than that of a habitable zone planet at periastron passage , we conclude that spots are not a significant issue to this particular study . due to the changing nature of star spot activity on a given star ,",
    "long - term monitoring of the star could disentangle the planet phase signature .",
    "we have presented several case studies from our analysis which serve as potentially interesting targets for detection during periastron passage .",
    "hd  156846b is a good ir target for studies of the atmospheric properties of planets in extreme ( highly eccentric ) orbits .",
    "hd  37605b and hd  33283b are also good targets since they have bright host stars , relatively high predicted flux ratios , and brief periods of large changes in the flux ratio .",
    "warm spitzer is capable of monitoring some of these target during the remaining lifetime of the mission .",
    "when this mission ceases operations , jwst will have instrumentation that is capable of continuing this study to even higher precision .",
    "the authors would like to thank ian crossfield , gregory laughlin , nicolas cowan , and lisa prato for several useful discussions .",
    "we would also like to thank the anonymous referee , whose comments greatly improved the quality of the paper .",
    "this research has made use of the exoplanet orbit database and the exoplanet data explorer at exoplanets.org .",
