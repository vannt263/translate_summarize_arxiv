    "this paper is concerned with intermediate and final asymptotics of spherically symmetric solutions in einstein - skyrme ( es ) model and is meant as a natural extension of similar analysis done in @xcite .",
    "es model is known @xcite as the model which admits a surprisingly rich spectrum of asymptotically flat static spherically symmetric solutions , both with and without horizon . in particular , the static @xmath0 spherically symmetric solution ( skyrmion ) is stable @xcite .",
    "such stable static solutions are very important configurations in any physical model as they are natural candidates for endstates of a generic evolution . during this evolution",
    "the system relaxes to the final stable configuration radiating energy to infinity .",
    "this radiation contains information about the nature of the central object , therefore the understanding of the mechanism of the emission is of crucial importance .",
    "skyrme model was suggested by t.h.r .",
    "skyrme @xcite as a model describing properties of baryons in particle physics .",
    "it is a nonlinear model of a chiral field in which baryons are identified as solitons  topologically stable static field configurations .",
    "apart from its usefulness in particle physics the model is interesting theoretically because despite of its simplicity we may observe here  both in flat space as well as in self - gravitating case  all features of the relaxation process .",
    "so for generic initial data after short period of evolution sensitive to the initial conditions , the system reaches intermediate asymptotics which may be described by the sum of exponentially decaying oscillations ( so called quasinormal modes ) superimposed on final , static skyrmion configuration .",
    "its long - time asymptotics is governed by the power - law tail .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section ii with the specification of the model .",
    "then in section iii we discuss the linear stability of the skyrmion .",
    "next section iv is devoted to the calculation of parameters of quasinormal modes . in section",
    "v we describe the numerical method used in calculation of the time evolution and demonstrate the results of calculation of quasinormal modes obtained directly from the numerical evolution as well as from the method described in section iv . in this section",
    "we discuss also the results for power - law tails .",
    "we consider the einstein - skyrme model , so the matter in our model is a chiral field  an @xmath1  valued scalar function @xmath2 with dynamics given by the lagrangian @xcite : @xmath3^{2 } - \\frac{1}{16 \\pi g } r,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the covariant derivative with respect to the spacetime metric , @xmath5  gravitational constant and @xmath6  scalar of curvature . by choosing appropriate units of mass and length we set the values of coupling constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 to one .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of spherical symmetry and use the polar time slicing and the areal radial coordinate so we may parameterize the metric as follows @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the standard metric on the unit 2-sphere . for the chiral field",
    "we apply the usual hedgehog ansatz @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the vector of pauli matrices and @xmath13  unit radial vector .",
    "we denote @xmath14 and @xmath15 by overdots and primes respectively and introduce an auxiliary variable @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and as a result obtain the following set of es equations : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22    here @xmath23 is dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "we are interested in regular asymptotically flat solution of es equations . to ensure the regularity in the center , @xmath24 , we impose the following boundary condition @xmath25 for @xmath26",
    ". asymptotic flatness of initial data @xmath27 requires that @xmath28 at infinity , where the integer @xmath29 , which we will call baryon number , is equal to the topological degree of the chiral field . as long as no horizon forms the baryon number of initial configuration is preserved during the evolution .",
    "therefore the asymptotic flatness condition breaks the initial value problems into infinitely many disjoint topological sectors labeled by the baryon number @xmath29 .",
    "below we consider mainly @xmath0 sector .",
    "in is a well established fact @xcite that in this sector for @xmath30 the eqs.([dotf]-[hamilton ] ) have two regular static solutions .",
    "one of them is linearly stable and is identical with flat skyrmion for @xmath31 , so we regard it just as a gravitationally distorted skyrmion .",
    "the second one , which we denote by @xmath32 is unstable .",
    "this two solutions coalesce at @xmath33 and disappear for @xmath34 .",
    "we are interested in relaxation processes of solutions to the static configuration , therefore we start with the linear stability analysis of skyrmion .",
    "as we restrict ourselves only to the spherically symmetric perturbations , we use the following standard decomposition of solutions : @xmath35 } f(r , t)=s(r)+f_{1}(r , t),\\quad n(r , t)=n_{0}(r)+n_{1}(r , t),\\quad\\delta(r , t)=\\delta_{0}(r)+\\delta_{1}(r , t),\\ ] ] where ( @xmath36 ) denote static skyrmion configuration .",
    "we plug this decomposition into eqs.([dotf]-[hamilton ] ) and linearize .",
    "as it was demonstrated in @xcite , the analysis of such system simplifies considerably because in spherical symmetry the metric perturbations which enter the pulsation equation for @xmath37 are completely determined by the matter perturbations . exploiting this and introducing auxiliary field @xmath38 defined by the formula @xmath39",
    "we obtain the linear pulsation equation for @xmath38 : @xmath40 let us note that the potential @xmath41 is determined entirely by the functions describing the static skyrmion and is given by the formulae : @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 here @xmath45 .",
    "let us examine the behavior of the finite part of potential @xmath46 for large r. we may easily find , that this behavior in the flat space and in the case of the self - gravitating model are different . in both cases we have @xmath47 what means that @xmath48 . in case of the flat model we have additionally @xmath49",
    "; this means that potential @xmath50 . for self - gravitating case",
    "@xmath51 what leads to the relation @xmath52 for @xmath53",
    ". this difference will be important in the discussion of power - law tails .",
    "using the radial coordinate @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 and assuming the time - dependence of the form @xmath56 , we transfer eq.([pulsation_v ] ) into a radial p - wave schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath57 here the potential @xmath58 is bounded for all @xmath54 .",
    "the investigation of linear stability is then reduced to study the eigenvalue problem ( [ schrodinger ] ) in the space of square integrable functions .",
    "this was done in @xcite , where it was found , that the spectrum around the skyrmion is continuous and positive , @xmath59 .",
    "this means that the gravitating skyrmion is linearly stable .",
    "if we make similar calculation for @xmath32 we find out that eq.([schrodinger ] ) has exactly one bound state with @xmath60 , indicating an instability  exponentially growing mode with the exponent @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath62 , the instability exponent @xmath63 . numerical calculation done in @xcite confirm the above results also in nonlinear analysis .",
    "linear stability of the skyrmion is an important property of es system because it tells us that this solution is an attractor describing the final configurations in @xmath0 sector of initial data problem .",
    "however it does not provide a direct information about the way this configuration is reached in the evolution . to obtain the intermediate and long time asymptotics of solutions of eqs.([dotf]-[hamilton ] ) one usually discuss the eq.([schrodinger ] ) describing the perturbation of skyrmion .",
    "a problem of this type  especially perturbations of black holes and compact objects  has a long history starting with the papers of regge and wheeler @xcite , zerilli @xcite and price @xcite , for a review see @xcite and @xcite . as we will see the perturbations of skyrmion at intermediate times",
    "are described by quasinormal modes , whereas late time asymptotics is controlled by a power - law tail . to simplify the notation",
    "we will neglect the difference between the radial coordinates @xmath64 and @xmath54 , so the eq.([schrodinger ] ) takes the form :    @xmath65    in the case of es system by quasinormal mode we will understand the solution of eq.([radial ] ) satisfying the outgoing wave conditions for @xmath66 :    @xmath67    and regular at the center .",
    "we expect , that the mode with the least damping @xmath68 will dominate the intermediate asymptotics in the @xmath0 sector . to find a proper solution we have to apply the above boundary condition to the solution of eq.([radial ] ) ; this will quantize the eigenvalue @xmath69 .    however , it is not easy to implement the boundary condition of this type ( especially for long  range potentials ) . to see that let us remark , that for @xmath70 , where @xmath6  the range of potential , any regular solutions @xmath71 of eq.([radial ] )",
    "may be decomposed in terms of riccati - hankel functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 as follows : @xmath74 the riccati - hankel functions have the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath75 , hence the outgoing wave boundary conditions correspond to the zeros of @xmath76 coefficient . however , this is numerically difficult to achieve as the `` unwanted '' ingoing component of ( [ decomposition ] ) decreases exponentially with @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , we try to remove a numerically small ingoing component on the background of large outgoing component .",
    "to achieve this we should have there a very good resolution , at least of order of @xmath77 .",
    "for this reason a usual procedure of shooting from @xmath78 and varying @xmath69 until @xmath76 vanishes ( naive shooting ) is not feasible , especially in case of @xmath79 .",
    "we have found that much better way of proceeding is to use a shooting - to - a - fitting - point technique which is much more accurate and additionally may be generalized to the case of long - range potentials . in this technique",
    "we shoot from two sides  @xmath78 ( requiring that the solution is regular for @xmath53 ) and some large @xmath80 , where the decomposition ( [ decomposition ] ) works and try to match both solutions at some intermediate @xmath81 .",
    "technically @xcite , we use the amplitude ",
    "phase representation for the solution of eq.([radial ] ) : @xmath82 . as a result ,",
    "this equation for complex function @xmath71 is replaced by the following system of two equations for real functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 : @xmath85 @xmath86 regularity at the center requires : @xmath87 we solve this equations numerically from @xmath78 up to some relatively small intermediate @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath88 we replace the schrdinger equation ( [ radial ] ) by its riccati form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is defined as a logarithmic derivative of @xmath71 : @xmath91 .",
    "we solve this equation backwards in @xmath64 from some large @xmath80 to the intermediate @xmath81 defined above , starting with the initial value @xmath92 .",
    "we assume , that @xmath80 is large enough , so the riccati - hankel function @xmath93 which is exact outgoing solution of the free ( @xmath94 ) riccati equation approximates well the solution of the full riccati equation . now",
    "the quantization condition for the quasinormal modes is the matching of logarithmic derivatives at intermediate matching point @xmath81 .",
    "we have performed extensive numerical studies of long time asymptotics of solutions in es model . to this end",
    "we have solved initial value problem ( [ dotf][hamilton ] ) for various baryon numbers , coupling constant and initial data . to do this",
    "we apply the standard method of lines to the pair of dynamic equations ( [ dotf ] ) and ( [ wave ] ) .",
    "this means that we discretize space and replace spatial derivatives by proper algebraic difference approximations . in that way we change the original set of dynamical pdes into a system of odes , which may be solved by standard methods .",
    "usually we use 5-point , fourth - order accurate spatial discretization and solve the resulting ode system by means of fourth - order runge - kutta method . in addition , on each time layer we update the metric functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 by solving the slicing condition ( [ delta ] ) and hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamilton ] ) . here",
    "we also use fourth - order runge - kutta method with spline interpolation for the values of grid functions at the positions out of the grid which are also required by the integration procedure . as a result",
    "we have finite difference method which is fourth - order accurate both in space and time .",
    "we apply this method to the calculation of time evolution which starts with different initial conditions .",
    "typical examples of initial data are :        to ensure the regularity at the origin we impose the boundary conditions : @xmath100 . on the outer boundary",
    "we apply outgoing wave boundary condition .",
    "this is not enough when we calculate the properties of tails ; in order to avoid the contamination of results by the part of solution reflected from the outer boundary , we use the size of the grid big enough , so the calculation stops before the reflected signal reaches the observation point . in calculations of this kind",
    "the quadruple precision is crucial , otherwise the accumulation of round - off errors spoils the results at late times .",
    "the typical results of long time evolution in @xmath0 sector is demonstrated in fig.[fig1].a . in this figure a value of the field @xmath101 measured at a fixed value of @xmath64",
    "is plotted as a function of @xmath102 . in this figure",
    "we may observed all features of relaxation process towards a stable skyrmion configuration : the beginning of evolution is strongly dependent on the shape of initial data .",
    "after some time an intermediate asymptotics sets in ( @xmath103 ) where the relaxation manifest itself as a damped oscillations .",
    "finally , at large times ( @xmath104 ) we observe the power - law tail .",
    "the same features may be observed on a complementary picture where a late - time snapshot of solution ( see fig.[fig1].b ) , i.e. @xmath105 as a function of @xmath64 is seen .",
    "here we may also observed , that the fragment of solution corresponding to the quasi - normal modes treated as a function of @xmath64 grows exponentially , what makes the procedure of finding the mode parameters difficult numerically . using numerical data we may extract the parameters of least - damped quasi - normal mode ( see fig.[fig2 ] for details ) .",
    "we have also studied late time asymptotics , where quasi - normal modes are negligible and the relaxation process is dominated by power - law tail .",
    "our numerical calculations show that at late times the relaxation to the skyrmion takes the form : @xmath108 where the value of @xmath68 depends on the coupling constant @xmath109 and is equal 5 for @xmath110 and 4 for @xmath111 .",
    "as it was already pointed out in @xcite for the case of flat space , this does not agree with the predictions of linear scattering theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) . according to this theory , for late times the evolution of the system",
    "is well described by a linear wave equation with potential @xmath112 ( see eq.([pulsation_v ] ) ) .",
    "let us consider more general case , described by the equation : @xmath113 where @xmath112 is the finite part of potential .",
    "if the fall - off of @xmath112 at spatial infinity is @xmath114 , i.e. @xmath115 for @xmath116 , than for compactly supported initial data linear theory predicts : @xmath117 . as in our problem",
    "we have @xmath118 and @xmath119 for flat and @xmath120 for gravitating case ( see section iii ) , we may expect 8 and 5 for the values of power - law tail exponent for flat and gravitating model respectively , which is in disagreement with numerical results .",
    "this is another example of a situation where the tail has genuinely non - linear character and linear theory fails . to describe the tail correctly",
    ", one should use a nonlinear perturbatively scheme proposed recently by bizon et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "the application of this technique to the case of @xmath0 sector of es model is tedious , so we have checked , that we get the same values of tail exponents in the case of @xmath99 sector of es model and in non - linear sigma model .",
    "analyzes of tails in these models will be published elsewhere ( see @xcite for more details ) ."
