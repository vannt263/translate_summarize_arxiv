    "ages of stars are both fundamental and difficult to measure . stars of known age , such as members of star clusters , have therefore been studied intensively . for the far more numerous field stars , by contrast ,",
    "our tools for inferring ages are blunt and inexact ( see @xcite for a nice review of techniques used to estimate ages ) .",
    "we can infer ages for some binary stars , and also for turnoff stars , from the combination of parallax and metallicity measurements .",
    "however , for typical gkm dwarfs , slow luminosity evolution on the main sequence and ambiguities from metallicity and helium errors result in uncertain age estimates .",
    "measurements of ca ii h and k emission for main sequence stars led @xcite to insightfully notice an inverse relationship between chromospheric activity and stellar age .",
    "in an influential paper , @xcite argued that stellar rotation , activity , and lithium abundances for solar - like stars all decrease as the square root of age .",
    "rotation therefore provides an attractive alternative chronometer ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "stars with minimal _ nuclear _ evolution can experience strong _ rotational _ evolution , in the sense that low mass stars are observed to rotate more slowly as they age .",
    "the idea of rotation as a clock for low mass stars is an old one ; however , the prospect of rotation as a _ precise _ clock is new .",
    "we dedicate this paper to a comparison of rotation - mass - age predictions and a critical evaluation of the limiting precision of the rotation - mass - age relationship .",
    "we quantify two effects that limit the intrinsic precision of rotation - age relationships : the large initial range of stellar rotation rates and surface differential rotation .",
    "we also investigate the sensitivity of the age errors to different theoretical approaches and compare with intermediate aged and old cluster systems .",
    "the qualitative rotation - mass - age relationships from earlier decades are now being re - evaluated as practical tools for stellar population studies , and open cluster stars have once again become a central calibrating tool . both large scale monitoring campaigns driven largely by planet transit searches and dedicated stellar rotation programs , such as the monitor project ( @xcite and @xcite ) , have built on pioneering period searches in clusters ( e.g.  @xcite . ) modern rotation - mass - age , or gyrochronology @xcite , relations @xcite are based on the following major insights gleaned from open cluster studies .",
    "protostars are born with a wide range of rotation rates ( e.g.  ngc 6530 , @xcite ; orion nebula cluster , @xcite ; ic 348 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , by the time young stars arrive on the main sequence , the majority of them are rotating at similar , and slow , rotation rates ( @xcite and @xcite are nice examples for the pleiades cluster . )",
    "one can therefore define a median relationship that is applicable to many solar analogs , even young ones . the median rotation period at fixed color increases with increased age .",
    "additionally , the width of the rotation distribution also narrows with time ; this process is fastest for solar analogs and takes progressively longer for lower mass stars .",
    "this convergence is seen in solar analogs by ages of order 500  600 myr , exemplified by the hyades @xcite and m37 @xcite .",
    "published gyrochronology prescriptions take advantage of these basic features to define working relationships between rotation , color , and age using a semi - empirical approach .",
    "the median rotation of the bulk population is defined for young open clusters , tested in clusters with ages under 1 gyr , and extrapolated to older stars using the solar calibration as a constraint .",
    "gyrochronology relationships provide an empirical expression for rotation as a function of color with a time dependence based on @xcite .",
    "gyrochronology is a promising concept , but there is real tension between our understanding of angular momentum evolution , cluster data , and a simple mapping of rotation onto a mass - dependent age .",
    "this is especially true for rotation - mass - age relationships in the context of young clusters , which we examine in a companion paper ( epstein , pinsonneault , & terndrup 2013 ; paper ii . )",
    "these theoretical issues are important because the simple empirical fits described above make strong assumptions about the underlying physics , and these assumptions are not consistent with the results of detailed studies .",
    "we therefore begin with a brief review of modern models of angular momentum evolution , and then use their properties as guidance for a more physically motivated approach to gyrochronology .",
    "the theory of angular momentum evolution is complex . to predict rotation - age relationships",
    ", one must understand the origin of stellar rotation , angular momentum transport in stellar interiors , and angular momentum loss from magnetized solar - like winds .",
    "open clusters and star forming regions have been crucial for developing the standard picture of angular momentum evolution in low mass stars .",
    "large rotation datasets , and models capable of addressing them , became available in the late 1980s ( @xcite ) .",
    "rotation measurements in star forming regions set the initial conditions for angular momentum evolution , while open clusters provide snapshots in time of the evolution of stellar rotation rates .",
    "a standard working model of angular momentum evolution has emerged , with some important refinements on the simplest possible model .",
    "protostars of the same mass are born with a range of rotation rates ( e.g.  @xcite ; for more recent work see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest model of angular momentum evolution would begin with the distribution of rotation rates in protostars and evolve them forward assuming a scaled solar angular momentum loss rate @xmath3 @xcite , which reproduces the @xcite law .",
    "early models of this form @xcite were inconsistent with open cluster data , and this pointed to three major refinements of the picture .",
    "star - disk interactions , grouped under the general label of disk - locking @xcite , are required to understand the mapping from protostars to young open cluster stars .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that disks with a maximum lifetime between 3 and 8 myr can reconcile the protostellar and zams rotation distributions .",
    "the survival of rapid rotation in young stars ( e.g. @xcite ) prohibits a simple scaling of the solar torque by the cube of the rotation rate ; saturation in the loss rate is required @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in proxies of magnetic activity @xcite and expected in wind models @xcite .",
    "both the activity and spin down data require a mass dependent saturation threshold @xcite , in the sense that lower mass stars saturate at lower rotation rates .",
    "the final additional ingredient is the detection of core - envelope decoupling .",
    "stars spin up as they contract onto the main sequence , where their structure stabilizes and the timescale for evolution increases .",
    "a magnetized wind will initially spin down the convective envelope ; the radiative core will then respond over the internal angular momentum transport timescale .",
    "there will be a rapid initial drop in surface rotation if the transport timescale is long enough , followed by an epoch where the core spins down and the envelope does not ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "once the entire star is coupled it will spin down as a solid body , even if there is a differentially rotating internal profile @xcite .",
    "the observational signature is that the slow rotator population in young open clusters spins down quickly at first , and then the spin down stalls .",
    "numerous studies have confirmed this phenomenon @xcite , with inferred timescales in the range of tens to hundreds of myr , depending on mass .",
    "rapid rotators appear to always spin down as a solid body , suggesting that the transport timescale is a function of both rotation rate and mass ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the underlying mechanisms for all three of these effects are active research topics , but they are all physically well - motivated and supported by strong empirical evidence .",
    "a practical consequence is that there are documented problems with adopting a skumanich - style spin down model in young stars .",
    "fortunately , there is strong evidence that the physical picture is simpler for the older stars that will dominate a field sample .",
    "protostar - accretion disk interactions are important on timescales of millions of years , while effective core - envelope coupling is established by an age of 500 myr ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we therefore focus on the expected behavior of old field stars , with an emphasis on stars older than 500 myr",
    ". the distribution of initial conditions can be empirically specified by open cluster stars , and the assumption of solid body spin down at this age and beyond is well - justified .",
    "furthermore , there are good constraints on angular momentum loss , permitting a well - posed forward modeling of angular momentum evolution .",
    "much recent work has focused on presenting gyrochronology recipes as a function of color .",
    "we compare these relationships with two angular momentum loss models and the extremely limited current data for old stars .",
    "new data , especially from the kepler mission , will shed valuable light on the actual functional form of rotational evolution in old stars ( a point that we will return to in the conclusions . ) here , we emphasize an under - appreciated aspect of the problem : _ how precise are rotational ages ? _",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : method ] contains a detailed description of the initial conditions , stellar interior model , braking law , and assumptions necessary to model stellar angular momentum evolution .",
    "we present our results in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we compare the median rotation - mass - age relationship predicted by our preferred angular momentum loss model with an alternate braking law (  [ sec : timeevolution ] ) and published gyrochronology relations (  [ sec : compare2gyrochronology ] ) .",
    "sources of uncertainty in obtaining rotation - based ages are quantified in  [",
    "sec : uncertainties ] .",
    "these include both fundamental limitations ( e.g.  arising from the initial scatter in rotation rates ,  [ sec : ageatfixedp ] , and from surface differential rotation ,  [ sec : minperiod ] ) and model - specific errors (  [ sec : distwidth ] ) .",
    "we compare our models with open cluster rotation period data in  [ sec : intermediate - agecluster ] .",
    "those theoretical predictions are tested against observational constraints from two binary star systems 61 cyg and @xmath1 cen in  [ sec : oldfieldstars ] .",
    "kepler and corot are measuring asteroseismic ages for tens of thousands of old solar - like stars ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , such space missions cover only a limited number of fields and targets .",
    "we therefore also examine how the prospects for rotation - mass - age relationships depend on the sensitivity of the survey . in  [ sec : conclusions ] , we demonstrate that ground - based studies can find young to intermediate aged populations ( based on variability ) for plausible precision ranges , while it is likely that the detection of older populations will require a degree of precision currently achievable only from space .",
    "we also compare the limiting precision of rotation - based ages with other age diagnostics : trigonometric parallaxes and asteroseismology .",
    "we investigate two observational effects that limit the precision of rotation - age relationships : the range of rotation rates at fixed age and the precision of rotation period measurements .",
    "this requires an angular momentum evolution model and a means of specifying the range of rotation rates .",
    "our adopted initial conditions and treatment of differential rotation are described in  [ sec : initial conditions ] .",
    "we provide the details of our stellar interiors and angular momentum evolution models in  [ sec : interiors ] and  [ sec : torque ] , respectively .",
    "we discuss the benefits of using the intermediate - aged cluster m37 to set the initial conditions for the angular momentum loss models in  [ sec : m37 ] .",
    "we also introduce other intermediate - age clusters that can be used to constrain our angular momentum evolution models (  [ sec : intermediate - ageclusterdata ] ) .",
    "we use observations of old field stars conducted by the mount wilson survey to determine the significance of differential rotation (  [ sec : old field star dr ] ) .",
    "there are three natural starting points for angular momentum evolution studies .",
    "the protostellar domain is the natural physical one , but forward evolution requires modeling of the interaction between protostars and disks .",
    "we could also begin with young open clusters , but it is clear from prior work that the surface rotation rates do not reflect the internal angular momentum content .",
    "we have dedicated a separate paper to studying this ( different ) problem and the implications for rotation - age relationships in young stellar populations . by contrast",
    ", solar analogs in the 500 myr and older regime can be treated as more strongly coupled , permitting a much less model dependent forward approach .",
    "we therefore bypass model - induced uncertainties in the initial rotation distribution by adopting an empirical rotation distribution drawn from measurements of stellar rotation in the intermediate - aged open cluster m37 ( ngc 2099 )",
    ". the vast majority of field stars will be older than 500 myr , which makes this simpler approach attractive for examining field star rotation studies .",
    "we selected m37 because it is the cluster with the largest homogeneous set of measured rotation periods spanning a wide color range in the intermediate age range . using an empirical distribution to set the initial conditions , however",
    ", does mean that the results are sensitive to the same biases and systematics present in the input cluster data .",
    "fortunately , m37 has well understood biases , measures of completeness , and little field contamination . @xcite performed a deep , 20 night survey with the mmt of m37 , reaching down to @xmath4 mag .",
    "they determined an age of @xmath5 myr ( with overshooting ) , metallicity [ m / h]=@xmath6 , and distance modulus @xmath7 .",
    "reaching down to @xmath4 mag . searching for periodic variability using a multiharmonic aov algorithm",
    "@xcite yielded a clean sample of 372 rotation period measurements .",
    "the sample is close to 100% complete to @xmath8 mag ( see figure 9 in @xcite ) , in the sense of detecting stars with modulation above 0.01 mag , although the color - period diagram may be biased toward brighter stars .",
    "this means that an increasing fraction of cluster members have undetectable variations as mass declines .",
    "hartman et al .  estimate @xmath9 contamination of the cluster sample by background field stars .",
    "@xcite obtained b , v , and i@xmath10 band photometry for this cluster . for a given set of isochrones",
    ", different colors resulted in consistent mass estimates in regimes where the isochrones were not double - valued .",
    "for this paper , we select ( v  i@xmath10)@xmath11 to estimate mass because it has a large dynamic range and its relationship to mass remains monotonic for cool stars .",
    "the ( v  i@xmath10 ) photometry has been corrected for reddening e(v ",
    "i@xmath10)=0.355 @xcite and compared to the corresponding 550 myr , [ fe / h@xmath12=+0.045 $ ] yrec isochrone .",
    "the implications of our choice of isochrone for the forward modeling are discussed in section 3 .",
    "we will test the common assumption that clusters form an evolutionary sequence by comparing the rotation distribution predicted by our angular momentum evolution model ( anchored at m37 ) with observations in the hyades , praesepe , and ngc 6811 .",
    "rotation - based clocks are based on the premise that stars share a common underlying rotation distribution at birth and their subsequent angular momentum evolution is governed by the same physics . in this paradigm , each cluster is a realization of the underlying stellar rotation distribution at a given age . if cosmic scatter in the initial distribution of rotation rates is small , the predicted rotation distribution at a future time will be insensitive to the choice of initial conditions . here",

    "the hyades was one of the first open clusters targeted by rotation period surveys @xcite .",
    "however , the large angular extent of the cluster makes it difficult to monitor large numbers of cluster members .",
    "recently , @xcite doubled the number of cluster stars with measured rotation periods by using lightcurves from the wide - angle search for planets ( superwasp ) survey .",
    "@xcite report rotation periods for 62 members of hyades and 52 members of praesepe , where the cluster membership probability was determined by comparing proper motion and apparent magnitude with expectations .",
    "praesepe has been a beehive of activity with three rotation period studies published within one year @xcite .",
    "together , this provides a sample of 87 hyades members and 116 praesepe members .",
    "b- and v - band photometry is not available for all hyades and praesepe members , so we instead utilize 2mass photometry for these two clusters to bin the sample by color and compare to simulated rotation distributions .",
    "we adopt e(b ",
    "v)=0 for hyades and praesepe ( @xcite , respectively , following @xcite . )",

    "one possible cause for this @xmath20 myr dispute over the age of the cluster is significant contamination of the cmd by background field stars .",
    "@xcite provides cluster membership probabilities based on relative proper motions , but @xcite are the first to perform a radial velocity test for membership in this cluster .",
    "we will examine how latitudinal differential rotation affects the precision of rotation period measurements and , by extension , rotation - based ages .",
    "if the sun s differential rotation is characteristic of solar type stars , then the latitude of a star spot could significantly impact the measured rotation period .",
    "differential rotation in field stars is best characterized by the mount wilson survey , with observations of stars spanning years to over a decade ( e.g.  @xcite , see  [ sec : oldfieldstars ] ) .",
    "ideally , this would provide the uncertainty in rotation period measurements due to differential rotation .",
    "however , because @xcite only report the minimum , maximum , and mean observed rotation period , we can not know the shape of the period distribution .",
    "we therefore performed a simulation to determine the relationship between the range of observed rotation rates ( @xmath21 ) and the uncertainty in the mean period ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we randomly drew periods from the underlying distribution , which for simplicity we modeled as a gaussian .",
    "we calculated @xmath21 as a function of the number observing seasons and compared it to the standard deviation of the underlying gaussian .",
    "as the number of observations of the star increases , so too does the likelihood that you catch the star in one of the lower probability states ( e.g.  with a polar star spot ) , leading to a larger @xmath21 . after performing 1000 trials , we computed the mean @xmath23 relationship .",
    "we then used this tabulated relationship to determine an effective period uncertainty for the @xcite sample .",
    "the fractional uncertainty ranges from @xmath24 to 16% , with an average of 5% .",
    "we find weak evidence for a linear trend , where the fractional uncertainty increases with mean period .",
    "for slowly rotating stars ( @xmath25 days ) , where differential rotation is a larger effect , the mean fractional uncertainty is 7% .",
    "we model the impact of differential rotation as setting a lower limit on the range of rotation periods . because we use the interquartile range rather than a standard deviation to quantify the range of rotation periods , we correct for the fact that the interquartile range falls within @xmath26 . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we adopt a minimum fractional uncertainty , such that with the correction , latitudinal differential rotation sets a lower limit on the precision of rotation period measurements of @xmath27 .",
    "this is just slightly larger than would be found using the mean fractional uncertainty , but well within the range found in the simulation of @xcite data described above .",
    "we anchor our angular momentum study in theoretical models of stellar structure calculated using the yrec stellar interior models .",
    "we compute solar metallicity models ( x=0.7190 , z=0.0165 ) with no diffusion .",
    "these provide a prior on a star s he abundance , radius , moment of inertia , convective overturn timescale ( @xmath28 ) , and luminosity as a function of stellar mass and age .    the standard model of angular momentum loss described in  [ sec : introstdpic ] is only valid for stars in a particular mass range . because stars above spectral type f8 show no obvious sign of a rotation - age relationship @xcite , this sets an upper mass limit on where rotation - based ages are well motivated . for cooler stars",
    ", the saturation threshold appears to scale with the ratio of the rotation period to the overturn timescale , called the rossby number ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "however , there is evidence for a departure from a rossby - scaled saturation threshold in the low mass regime ( @xcite ; see  [ sec : kawaler ] ) .",
    "furthermore , quantities like @xmath28 become ill - defined for fully convective stars .",
    "the old open clusters also have sparse data at the low mass end .",
    "we therefore restrict our calculations to the mass range of @xmath30 , sampled in equally spaced 0.05 m@xmath0 intervals .",
    "stars in m37 ( used to define the initial rotation distribution ,  [ sec : m37 ] ) are excluded if their mass lies outside of this restricted range where our angular momentum loss model is valid .",
    "the empirically determined stellar masses and rotation rates from m37 set the initial conditions (  [ sec : m37 ] ) . a prescription for angular momentum loss (  [ sec : torque ] ) is used to simulate m37 s rotational future .",
    "we calculate a star s angular momentum at each point in time on a logarithmically - spaced grid of ages . at fixed age",
    ", we perform a polynomial interpolation in logarithmic rotation period on a grid of models to the mass of the star .",
    "we set the birth line by requiring that the deuterium abundance declines to a level of 0.1% below the initial value , resulting in a slight offset from the @xcite models .",
    "we stop our models if their age exceeds either a stars lifetime on the main sequence or the age of the galactic disk , assumed to be 10 gyr .",

    ", there is numerical jitter in @xmath28 at the @xmath33% level over a stars s main sequence lifetime .",
    "we therefore average @xmath28 over the five closest points in time to smooth over these numerical perturbations in the depth of the convection zone .",
    "we adopt solid body rotation in radiative and convective regions for our angular momentum transport treatment .",
    "the latitude - averaged solar convection zone rotation is consistent with this approximation .",
    "core and envelope coupling timescales are short in comparison to the lifetime of g , k , and m dwarfs discussed here ( e.g.  @xcite ) . because we are studying the rotation of field stars , assuming that the coupling timescale for angular momentum transport between the core and envelope is short ( i.e. solid body rotation is enforced at all times ) is a reasonable approximation for the majority of the age range of interest .      to simulate stellar angular momentum loss , we adopt as our preferred model a modified kawaler wind law @xcite .",
    "@xcite was able to recover the @xcite law ( @xmath34 ) for his favored choice of the magnetic field geometry .",
    "this yields a wind law of the form @xmath35 , where the normalizing constant @xmath36 parametrizes our ignorance about winds and magnetic field generation in stars .",
    "this produces a nearly mass - independent angular momentum loss rate .",
    "the strongly mass - dependent rotation data , especially at at @xmath37 and @xmath38 , led @xcite to question the kawaler loss law ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "the former likely occurs because the physics changes for high mass stars with a very thin surface convection zone , resulting in a different mass - dependence for stars above the kraft break .",
    "the kawaler angular momentum loss law is best suited to operate in the region below the kraft break and above the fully convective limit , where stars may develop a different type of dynamo .",
    "as initially conceived , this law does not account for magnetic saturation a necessary element in the standard theory of angular momentum loss (  [ sec : introstdpic ] ) .",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite in modifying the original kawaler loss law to include a prescription for how the torque changes when a star s magnetic field strength saturates at a critical rotation rate @xmath39 .",
    "because the @xcite wind law ( discussed in the next section  [ sec : reinerslaw ] ) treats magnetic saturation differently , we supply a brief discussion of the empirical motivation and prior theoretical work that produced the functional form of the saturation threshold adopted here .",
    "observational studies of rotation and magnetic activity indicators support a rossby - scaled magnetic saturation threshold .",
    "both chromospheric ca ii h and k and coronal x - ray emission display a break in their relationship with rossby number @xcite .",
    "in fact , activity correlates more tightly with rossby number than rotation period @xcite . because measures of stellar activity serve as a proxy for magnetic field strength , which in turn powers the wind , the rate of angular momentum loss is also thought to plateau .",
    "consequently , @xcite proposed the addition of a rossby scaled saturation threshold for stars more massive than 0.5 m@xmath0 , resulting in the following modified kawaler wind law :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 from the solar mass yrec model , @xmath42 s. because lower mass stars have deeper convection zones , @xmath28 contains the mass dependence in the saturation threshold .",
    "x - ray measurements confine the saturation threshold @xmath39 to the range 5 to 20 @xmath43 @xcite . @xcite",
    "tested the rossby scaling by comparing theoretical models to rotation distributions of ic 2602 , ic 2391 , @xmath1 per , the pleiades , and hyades .",
    "they found that the @xcite  scaling ( @xmath44 for solid body models ) works for stars with masses between @xmath45 .",
    "however , the rossby scaling breaks down for lower mass stars ; @xcite  argue that the saturation threshold drops more steeply than a rossby scaling for stars with 0.1 m@xmath46 .",
    "they then used the clusters to empirically measure the mass dependence of @xmath39 for stars in this mass range . for solid body models , they find that @xmath47 , 6.2 , 5.1 , 3.6 , and 1.7 @xmath43 at 0.5 , 0.4 , 0.3 , 0.2 , and 0.1 m@xmath0 .",

    "gyrochronology can define an age range , rather than just place upper limits on the age , in the shaded region . in some windows of mass and period space , constraints tighter than @xmath105 dex",

    "as before , the region where gyrochronology can only provide an upper limit on the age arises from the initial spread in rotation rates .",

    "the upward slope of the lower boundary at high mass represents these stars evolving off the main sequence .",
    "we offer the following cautions when interpreting this figure .",
    "first , because we use the interquartile region as our measure of the width of the rotation distribution , there will be stars that lie outside this range .",
    "second , the specific values of the period and age uncertainty depend on the validity of the underlying angular momentum evolution model .",
    "thus far , we have used the widely - adopted @xcite prescription for angular momentum loss , modified to include a rossby - dependent saturation threshold as described in  [ sec : kawaler ] . while this simple model reproduces observations well in the open cluster domain ; there is limited data for older field stars .",
    "alternative formulations should therefore be explored , and the @xcite prescription is an intriguing choice .",
    "following the same procedure as before , but instead using the @xcite wind law produces the fractional age uncertainty contours displayed in figure [ fig : reinerscontours ] .",
    "the @xcite braking law introduces some interesting features that merit closer examination .",
    "because the reiners law enforces rapid rotation among low mass stars until late times , rotation provides only a weak constraint on age . for stars with m@xmath106 m@xmath0",
    ", rotation - based ages can not be pinned down to better than 50% , regardless of the precision of rotation period measurements . among higher mass stars ,",
    "@xcite predict rapid angular momentum evolution until @xmath107 myr .",
    "if a star is caught with a rotation period in this range , its age may be determined to a precision of about 7% ( or approximately 30 - 50 myr ) . imposing a 10% period measurement error ( figure [ fig : reinerscontours ] , bottom panel ) produces a sweet spot for stars with rotation periods around 10 days .",
    "unfortunately , achieving these theoretical limits may not be feasible with real stars .",
    "old field stars have a significant range in measured surface rotation rates which reflects latitudinal surface differential rotation ( see  [ sec : old field star dr ] ) .",
    "this provides an additional fundamental source of uncertainty in rotation - based ages : where on the surface is the rotation period being measured ?",

    "comparison between the upper and lower panels shows that , even given a perfect angular momentum loss theory , latitudinal differential rotation at this level sets a floor on the age precision from gyrochronology estimates instead of allowing the range of rotation rates to converge arbitrarily .    for cool and young stars ,",
    "the range in initial rotation rates dominates the error budget for rotation - based ages , but massive and older stars are instead limited by the period uncertainty set by differential rotation .",
    "for example , if a @xmath111m@xmath0 star has a rotation period of 11.5 days , gyrochronology can only constrain its age to a factor of 4.7 regardless of whether there is a minimum precision in period . meanwhile",
    ", the age of a 0.8 m@xmath0 star with a period of 40 days can be tightly constrained to 2% with perfect period measurements , but only to 20% when we include a 10% range due to differential rotation . for the sun s mass and equatorial rotation period , its age",
    "can be constrained to 2% with perfect period measurements . with this correction for differential rotation , the sun s age",
    "is predicted to lie between 4.07 and 4.85 gyr . generally , imposing a 10% range in rotation periods translates to a 20% uncertainty in age .",
    "the dotted curves in figure [ fig : massrotationcontour ] delineate the median rotation period at a selected set of ages . at 550 myr and 10 gyr , rotation only sets a bound on the stellar age . at intermediate ages ,",
    "the median rotation period may be mapped onto a typical uncertainty for a star of a given age .",
    "although the logarithmic scale from figure [ fig : massrotationcontour ] is useful for visualizing the fractional error , the absolute age error also provides a helpful comparison .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ fig : medianageerror10 - 90 ] trace the absolute age uncertainties for stars with the median rotation period at select ages . given arbitrarily accurate rotation period measurements , stars more massive than 0.75 m@xmath0 always have an uncertainty in age smaller than 270 myr . adding in a 10% uncertainty in rotation period has the effect of capping the age precision at around 0.38 , 1 , or 1.5 gyr for a 2 , 5 , or 8 gyr population , respectively .",
    "the absolute age uncertainties are smallest for younger stars , but become increasely larger for older stars . nonetheless , the absolute age uncertainty is always below 2 gyr for stars with m @xmath112 m@xmath0 .",
    "the wide binaries 61 cyg and @xmath1 cen corroborate this expected level of uncertainty in rotation - based ages due to latitudinal surface differential rotation (  [ sec : oldfieldstars ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : reinersmedian ] shows the absolute age uncertainty predicted by both the kawaler and @xcite braking laws . when measurement uncertainty is introduced in the bottom panel , the @xcite law predicts degraded precision in old stars because the @xcite law has a weaker rate of angular momentum loss than the kawaler law does at ages @xmath113 gyr ( see figure [ fig : reiners ] ) . both exhibit stable rotation - based age uncertainties with mass down to a critical point where the age uncertainty abruptly becomes quite large , corresponding to the point of convergence .",
    "this effective boundary to the rotation - based age technique is dramatically shifted 0.15 m@xmath0 higher with the @xcite law .",
    "this shift is due to the mass - independent way that @xcite treat magnetic saturation .",
    "comparison of figures [ fig : m37movie ] and [ fig : moviereiners ] shows that @xcite set the saturation threshold lower than the rossby scaled saturation threshold for ( b  v)@xmath114 ( m@xmath115 m@xmath0 ) .",
    "this keeps stars in the saturated regime longer than with a rossby scaled saturation threshold . because a rossby - scaled saturation threshold is supported by observations of open clusters ( see [ sec : kawaler ] ) , we consider the kawaler version to be a more realistic boundary to the rotation - based age technique .    because the rotation - based age constraints differ strongly between these two angular momentum loss laws , properly testing the rate of angular momentum loss is important . for now , we favor the modified kawaler wind law because it properly reproduces skumanich spin down at late time for solar type stars and it incorporates a rossby scaled wind law , both of which are supported by open cluster observations ( see the discussion of hyades and praesepe in  [ sec : intermediate - agecluster ] ) .",
    "additionally , the @xcite law fails to reproduce the young and intermediate age open cluster distribution , as seen in their figure 4 .",
    "they predict rotation periods that are too long compared to the cluster m50 for m@xmath116 m@xmath0 .",
    "they argue that this is due to core - envelope decoupling , which is not included in their modeling .",
    "this can explain the presence of slow rotators over the mass range where core - envelope decoupling is expected to be important , primarily for solar - like stars with shallow surface convection zones .",
    "however , low mass stars ( below 0.5 - 0.6 m@xmath0 ) are well described empirically with solid body spin down models @xcite .",
    "the striking differences between their models and cluster data for cool dwarfs therefore can not be explained by this phenomenon .",
    "the modified kawaler braking law developed in response to problems in reproducing empirical trends , and a comparable modification of the @xcite prescription could be viable and interesting to explore .",
    "we compare the absolute age uncertainties in figure [ fig : medianageerror10 - 90 ] .",
    "the largest differences occur for low mass stars , where the spread in rotation rates is maintained until late times .",
    "the metric chosen to describe the rotation width does not change the functional form . even if arbitrarily accurate period measurements are possible , differences in the age uncertainty are only a few hundred myr for stars on the tightly converged mass - rotation sequence . from the bottom panel , we see these differences due to the choice of width metric are smaller than the age uncertainty due to differential rotation for stars with m @xmath117 m@xmath0 at 2 gyr and to even lower masses for older stars .",
    "we therefore consider the interquartile region a fair characterization of the rotation - based age uncertainty .",
    "we compare our results with the age uncertainty calculated in @xcite .",
    "instead of modeling the rotational evolution of the entire distribution , @xcite abstracts the morphology of the rotation distribution into two sequences .",
    "@xcite defines an analytic equation whose limiting behavior matches the expressions proposed in @xcite to reproduce the two sequences . using this function",
    ", @xcite finds that the absolute age range between the fastest and slowest rotators is a constant for a particular stellar mass , and is 255 myr at a solar mass . to compare with our models ,",
    "we adopt a more generous metric for the width of the distribution because @xcite is measuring the slowest and fastest rotators in the distribution . at a solar mass ,",
    "we predict the age range between the 10@xmath83 and 90@xmath83 percentile rotators is within @xmath118 myr for the first 5 gyr , in excellent agreement with the @xcite prediction .",
    "this is different by a factor of @xmath2 from the predictions that use the interquartile range to characterize the width for solar mass stars .",
    "as can be seen from the top panel of figure [ fig : medianageerror10 - 90 ] , our models corroborate @xcite s analytic result that the uncertainty in age is constant with time at a given mass when it is assumed that period measurements are arbitrarily accurate .",
    "our results are more general for two reasons .",
    "we utilize open cluster data to capture the mass - dependent range of initial rotation rates rather than assuming qualitative estimates for starting conditions .",
    "we also adopt a physically - motivated model for angular momentum loss that incorporates evolutionary changes in stellar properties , like the moment of inertia .",
    "uncertainties in the absolute age assigned to m37 affect all of our derived rotation - based ages . in  [ sec : initial conditions ] , we initialize all models to the age of m37 determined from @xcite . by fitting isochrones to the cluster main sequence , @xcite measured an age of @xmath5 myr . to see how this uncertainty in the initial conditions maps onto our age predictions , consider the illustrative case of skumanich spin down . in that scenario , the rotation rate scales as @xmath119 .",
    "this implies that :    @xmath120 ^ 2.\\ ] ]    thus , the age of m37 ( @xmath121 ) enters linearly into the calculation of a star s age ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "an analogous calculation may be performed for both the kawaler and the @xcite wind laws . as such , the @xmath855% uncertainty in the age of m37 @xcite propagates to a @xmath855% uncertainty in the ages predicted by these models .",
    "this uncertainty in the scale factor represents a systematic uncertainty for any semi - empirically calibrated model . the random error associated with the age of any particular cluster",
    "may be reduced by using many different clusters .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainty in the overall open cluster age scale will remain .",
    "the wind law describes the angular momentum loss rate in terms of mass , rather than an observable quantity like color .",
    "stellar interior models predict divergent mass - color relationships , particularly at the cooler end .",
    "our age uncertainties depend only weakly for m @xmath123 m@xmath0 .",
    "the measured rotation distribution of open cluster stars serves as a snapshot of stellar angular momentum evolution at fixed age .",
    "if these clusters are indeed representatives of an underlying evolutionary sequence , then a successful model should be able to evolve one clusters rotation distribution to match that of an older cluster . in this section , we show that this is the case .",
    "there are four intermediate - aged open clusters with substantial rotation samples and similar ages : m37 , hyades , praesepe , and ngc 6811 .",
    "the first three clusters have reliable published ages : 550 myr for m37 @xcite and 625 for hyades and praesepe ( @xcite . )    we begin with m37 at 550 myr , the youngest cluster of the four clusters from  [ sec : intermediate - ageclusterdata ] , and evolve it forward in time under two different models : a modified kawaler prescription and the @xcite wind law (  [ sec : torque ] ) .",
    "we use yrec isochrones to convert between mass and the appropriate color ( b  v for ngc 6811 and j ",
    "k for hyades and praesepe ) to compare m37 s simulated future distribution with the other cluster data .",
    "figures [ fig : hyadesdist ] , [ fig : praesepedist ] , and [ fig : ngc6811 ] depict the time evolution of m37 relative to the hyades , praesepe , and ngc 6811 , respectively . the age depicted in the panels",
    "are chosen to reflect the fiducial age of m37 ( 550 myr ; top ) and two of published age estimates for the comparison cluster described in  [ sec : intermediate - ageclusterdata ] .",
    "we focus on the regime where the rotation distribution has converged to a narrow band and divide this region into two color bins . for the hyades and praesepe , we choose a hot and cool bin with @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively . for ngc 6811 , we confine our analysis to the overlapping region of these two samples and choose bins @xmath126 and @xmath127 .    within each bin",
    ", we measure the agreement between the simulated m37 and observed cluster distributions by performing a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test .",
    "figures [ fig : ksproball_hyades ] , [ fig : ksproball_praesepe ] , and [ fig : ksproball_ngc6811 ] report the k - s probability as a function of the endpoint age of m37 s simulated time evolution , broken down both by color bin and angular momentum loss prescription for the hyades , praesepe , and ngc 6811 , respectively .",
    "we performed an additional test , where we allowed the initial age of m37 to vary by 10% .",
    "this resulted in an overall shift to the absolute age scale but had no effect on the relative agreement between probability distributions in different color bins .",
    "we therefore limit the discussion to the case where m37 s initial age is 550 myr .    in the case of the hyades , the region where the k - s probability exceeds 5% overlaps between the hot and cool color bins for ages between 665 and 785 myr with a modified kawaler model .",
    "not only are the hot and cool bins consistent with each other , but they also agree with both the @xcite and @xcite age estimates . in the @xcite models , the hot and cool bins do not formally agree .",
    "the @xcite model predicts rapid spindown among high mass stars , requires a younger age for bluer stars than for redder stars .",
    "a similar pattern is seen with the praesepe sample .",
    "the kawaler models are self - consistent between the hot and cool bins and agree with isochrone age estimates .",
    "the @xcite models differ relative to each other , but individually fall within the range of isochrone - based age estimates .",
    "the opposite situation is seen for ngc6811 . for this cluster ,",
    "the @xcite models are marginally self - consistent while the age predicted by the modified kawaler law differs significantly in the hot and cool bins .",
    "interestingly , the @xcite models agree more strongly with the @xcite young age for ngc6811 while the kawaler model is more consistent with the older @xcite age for the cluster.the rotation distribution of ngc6811 appears to flatline near a period of 12 days . because the kawaler models preserve the slope of the converged band in mass - period space , cool stars spindown down to a given period more quickly than hot stars do .",
    "the @xcite models actually invert the slope at the hot end , which agrees well with the flat observed ngc6811 distribution .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the observation that ngc 6811 rotation periods are flat with mass conflicts with data other old clusters ( e.g.  m37 , hyades , and praesepe ) that show a strong color dependence . this apparent inconsistency with other clusters could arise from crowding effects .",
    "rotation period studies in the crowded cluster fields are challenging because kepler s pixel scale is relatively large ( @xmath128  ) .",
    "for example , blending could cause a measured rotation period to be attributed to another star with a different color , smearing out a color - dependent sequence into a flat trend .",
    "this effect could explain why the modified kawaler law , which is consistent with both the hyades and praesepe , fails to match this older cluster .",
    "further rotation data , along with a robust age estimate , are needed for ngc 6811 to become a better calibration point .    because m37 , hyades , and praesepe are consistent under a modified kawaler wind law , selecting any one of these clusters to initialize the models",
    "will yield the same behavior .",
    "although it is possible to merge observations from these three clusters , such a heterogeneous sample would introduce complicated biases .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to select m37 to anchor our models of angular momentum evolution because it represents the largest and most homogeneous sample of the intermediate - aged clusters .    on the other hand , while the @xcite wind law has problems reproducing the observed rotation distributions in young ( see paper ii ) and intermediate - aged ( hyades , praesepe ) clusters , it does produce marginal agreement with ngc 6811 .",
    "this inconsistency with observations suggests that more consideration should be paid to the predicted mass - dependence of the @xcite angular momentum evolution for stars younger than ngc 6811 .",
    "however , the fact that the @xcite wind law agrees with the oldest cluster for which we have measured rotation periods makes it interesting to compare its rotation predictions for older stars .    in summary ,",
    "the hyades , praesepe , and m37 are consistent with one another for the kawaler angular momentum loss law , but that the cool and hot subsets require different ages for the reiners loss law .",
    "the situation is reversed for ngc 6811 , but observational selection effects may be important there . we therefore conclude that using m37 as a template is reasonable .",

    "if the @xcite rotation - based ages are too old , some published gyrochronology relationships produce ages that are too young .",
    "we compare the two solar - calibrated published gyrochronology relationships against these binaries and determine that the @xcite relation is consistent while the @xcite formalism is not .",
    "@xcite already performed this comparison , finding an age ( in years ) of @xmath160 and @xmath161 of 61 cyg s components using their mean rotation period , which average to @xmath162 .",
    "although this mean age ( 3.52 gyr ) is too young compared with the isochrone age of 61 cyg ( @xmath148 gyr ) , including the full range of rotation observed in 61 cyg broadens the range of rotation - based ages to @xmath163 gyr and @xmath164 gyr .",
    "similarly , for @xmath1 cen , @xcite report @xmath165 ( 5.01 gyr ) , which is inconsistent with the seismic age ( @xmath149 gyr ) at the @xmath166 level if the gyroage is treated as exact . with the inferred range of rotation periods , the tension between the seismic age and the @xcite age ranges ( @xmath167 gyr and @xmath168 gyr ) decreases to the @xmath169 level .",
    "thus , the mean @xcite trend is consistent with these binaries , but their estimated errors are too small .",
    "@xcite take the difference in predicted rotation - based ages of these coeval binary components as the error .",
    "they find an uncertainty of @xmath8511% in gyrochronology predictions , similar to the total error of 15% from @xcite .",
    "the analytic calculation of age uncertainty in @xcite uses the @xcite relationship ( see equation [ eq : donahue ] ) to estimate the period uncertainty due to surface differential rotation .",
    "we will discuss systematic sources of uncertainty in rotation - based ages , including surface differential rotation , in ",
    "[ sec : uncertainties ] .",
    "we next consider the @xcite relationship . for conciseness",
    ", we write the age corresponding to the mean and range due to surface differential rotation in a condensed format . for 61 cyg , the @xcite relation yields ages of @xmath170 gyr and @xmath171 gyr . for @xmath1 cen , we find @xmath172 gyr and @xmath173 gyr .",
    "even with the generous inferred range of surface rotation due to differential rotation , the @xcite relation predicts ages that are systematically too young , especially in the case of @xmath1 cen b. this large discrepancy with old field binaries , coupled with its deviation from m37 s median trend ( figure [ fig : gyrorange ] ) , indicates that the @xcite relationship does not reproduce observations .",
    "better rotation measurements for the @xmath1 cen system to determine a true , rather than inferred , range of differential rotation are important for testing rotation - mass - age relationships .",
    "these examples underscore the fact that differential rotation imposes an uncertainty in rotation - based ages and we will return to this point in  [ sec : minperiod ] .",
    "in addition to these binary systems , photometric monitoring programs have reported rotation periods for large samples of fgk ( corot , @xcite ) and m ( mearth , @xcite ) field stars .",
    "although these represent a heterogeneous stellar population that will include synchronized binaries as well as both dwarfs and subgiants , the rotation distribution gleaned by these studies still provides interesting constraints .",
    "these field star studies report rotation periods as long as 80100 days for fgkm stars .",
    "the existence of such slowly spinning stars presents a challenge to current rotation - mass - age relationships , if they are main sequence stars .",
    "because subgiants are expected to have longer rotation periods than dwarfs , we recommend a cautious interpretation of field star observations that do not distinguish evolutionary state .",
    "the three gyrochronology relationships tested here all predict that a 100 day period corresponds to ages older than 10 gyr within the color regime b  v@xmath174 .",
    "@xcite recognize that the braking predicted by their wind law is much too weak to explain the slowly rotating m stars from @xcite . to account for this problem",
    ", they change their saturation threshold from 8.5 days to @xmath175 days below @xmath176 m@xmath0 .",
    "they justify this break in the saturation behavior with an argument that the effective @xmath28 rises sharply at low masses ( e.g.  @xcite ) . with this adjustment ,",
    "the @xcite law reproduces the @xmath177 day rotation periods for m stars , but retains rapid rotaion for more massive stars .",
    "even with the adjusted @xmath178 , the @xcite law can not explain the recent detection of equally long rotation periods in k and g dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the modified kawaler wind law also fails to predict 100 day periods . at 10 gyr ,",
    "our models predict a median rotation period of @xmath179 days for g dwarfs , dropping to @xmath180 days for m dwarfs .",
    "these long - period field stars will present a serious challenge to our understanding of angular momentum evolution if the period measurements prove to not be aliased and if further examination places these stars on the main sequence .",
    "our goal is to quantify the strengths and weaknesses of rotation as a stellar age indicator . for which stars",
    "is rotation a good chronometer , and how reliable are those ages likely to be ?",
    "how does it compare to other age diagnostics ?",
    "both stellar rotation and activity diminish as stars age , and therefore rotation periods are harder to measure for old stars",
    ". how does the age limit for photometric surveys depend on the precision of the photometry ?",
    "in addition to these questions , there are broader issues that deserve comment .",
    "our data is concentrated in young stars , while the most promising applications are for old stars .",
    "what potential issues could complicate the interpretation of rotation in older stars ?",
    "how can observational selection effects be accounted for ? and",
    "what backgrounds need to be understood for stellar population studies ? in our summary",
    "we begin with the quantifiable answers to the first class of issues , and then turn our attention to the challenges and opportunities for progress in the future .",
    "our main result is that we have placed quantitative limits on the precision of stellar rotation as an age - indicator for sun - like stars .",
    "the upper mass limit for rotation - age relations is set by the f star transition from deep to shallow surface convection zones .",
    "it is not clear that stars more massive than m @xmath181 1.2 m@xmath0 have a rotation - age relationship , and it is difficult to detect rotation periods signals for stars more massive than the sun because the fractional star spot coverage , and the amplitude of variability , drops steeply for hotter stars .",
    "we demonstrated the method of deriving rotation - based ages from spin down models works for stars below the f star transition and above the fully convective limit by comparing the time evolved m37 rotation distribution with data from other intermediate - aged open clusters (  [ sec : intermediate - agecluster ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate that m37 , hyades , and praesepe are consistent under a modified kawaler wind law , while the alternate @xcite braking law is able to reproduce the 1 gyr old cluster ngc 6811 .",
    "although both theoretical angular momentum loss models and the semi - empirical published gyrochronology relationships are calibrated to the same open cluster data ( m37 ) , systematic errors arise in the extrapolation of these relationships forward in time . because of the limited data at late times",
    ", constraining the rotational behavior of old stars is difficult .",
    "we find that both a modified kawaler law and the @xcite gyrochronology relation agree with constraints from old field binaries , although their predicted ages at fixed rotation period differ by as much as 30% (  [ sec : oldfieldstars ] ) .",
    "we view this as a measure of the current systematic error level in rotation - age relations .",
    "these loose constraints from old binary stars opens the door for other angular momentum loss laws offering a different spin down trajectory than the modified kawaler law .",
    "a reassessment of the 25 year old kawaler braking law in the modern context is welcome .",
    "however , the proposed @xcite is inconsistent with data . taking",
    "the @xcite law at face value indicates that there are a strong mass- and radius - dependent trends in the spin down behavior at fixed @xmath69 .",
    "the torque is predicted to be so inefficient that it conflicts with long period rotation measurements from the old binary star systems ( 61 cyg and @xmath1 per ) , and field k and m dwarfs from corot @xcite , mearth @xcite , and mount wilson survey ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "future physically motivated revisions to the @xcite law may solve these problems .",
    "the @xcite relation is also inconsistent with the binary star data .",
    "more rotation and age data is necessary for old stars to provide better guidance to theory .",
    "the age errors for gyrochronology relationships are larger than optimistic early claims .",
    "we investigated the impact of the range of stellar birth rates (  [ sec : ageatfixedp ] ) and surface latitudinal differential rotation (  [ sec : minperiod ] ) on the precision of age measurements .",
    "these two phenomena will induce noise in age estimates of coeval stars even given perfect knowledge of the mean age - rotation relationship . below 0.6  0.7 m@xmath0 , the minimum errors in rotational ages rise steeply ; a range of surface rotation rates persists even for old stars .",
    "the exact boundary depends on how the period data is transformed from the observational ( color , period ) domain into the theoretical ( temperature , mass , age ) domain .",
    "fortunately , there is good empirical guidance for both the time evolution of rotation and the proper choice of color - temperature relationships for low mass stars .",
    "there is thus a window in the 0.6  1.2 m@xmath0 domain where stellar rotation is a promising chronometer .",
    "our technique for assigning errors for ages derived from rotation is conservative , and it may be possible to extract useful statistical age information from rotation in m dwarfs . the first step would be to empirically measure the shape of the rotation distribution and to empirically calibrate the time dependence of the spin down in systems of known age , such as open clusters .",
    "one could then construct a probability distribution of ages for a fixed rotation period . in",
    "any given field , however , the true probability distribution would be a function of the age distribution in the background .",
    "a good example would be a field with a star cluster superposed on a sparse background .",
    "a blind method would assign a range of ages to an intrinsically peaked age distribution .",
    "the age distribution in a given field would therefore need to be obtained independently ( for example , with rotation - based ages of k stars ) and a star by star age estimate could then be constructed for a sample of m dwarfs for which age estimates are otherwise difficult .",
    "this method would also be particularly useful for determining the ages of special targets , like planet hosts .",
    "stars like the sun do not have a unique surface rotation rate , and this injects another source of uncertainty in rotational age .",
    "the latter effect becomes dominant in old field stars , imposing a minimum uncertainty of 20% in age estimates for a 10% range in surface rotation period .",
    "different asymptotic angular momentum loss prescriptions have a major impact on the limiting precision , with the recent @xcite prescription implying much larger age uncertainties than previous spin down models based on a modified @xcite loss law .",
    "a proper empirical calibration of the late - time dependence should address the functional form of the rotation - age relationship , and it will also serve as a check on the width of the observed distribution . a proper calculation of the impact of surface differential rotation on period measurements would involve modeling of the number and latitude distribution of spots as a function of starspot cycle , and our method may overestimate the practical impact of surface differential rotation",
    ". a larger problem may be the poor visibility of solar analogs during minima in their activity cycles ( see below . ) because the timescale for stellar activity cycles is of order decades , monitoring over many seasons ( e.g.  the mount wilson survey ) would be necessary to measure a stars full range in surface rotation periods . nonetheless , surface differential is not a fundamental limitation in the same way as the initial conditions are . with extremely long term monitoring , surface differential rotation could in principle",
    "be calibrated out .",
    "in such a case , one might define a equatorial rotation period - mass - age relationship .",
    "however , the time investment to do this for a large number of calibrating stars is significant .",
    "as demonstrated in the previous section , a regime exists where the range of stellar rotation rates has converged enough to make gyrochronology a good clock . for stars of the same mass , the age constraints from gyrochronology are tighter for more slowly rotating stars . because magnetic activity , and therefore the presence of starspots , declines with time , so too does the amplitude of photometric variability",
    "this raises the question of whether there exists a good mass window where stellar amplitudes of variability are high enough that current ground based surveys can obtain rotation periods for the older , less magnetically active stars that are the most promising candidates for gyrochronology . in the following discussion",
    ", we demonstrate that current ground based studies can measure rotation - based ages for stars up to 1 - 2 gyr .    from the ground ,",
    "current rotational studies have a minimum detectable amplitude of 3 millimag ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which may be pushed to as good as 1 millimag in the future .",
    "the space - based kepler mission is monitoring roughly 150,000 stars with a time cadence of 30 min .",
    "its photometric precision is estimated to be 1 millimag for a 15.5 mag star and as good as @xmath182 mag for an 8@xmath83 mag star .",
    "indeed , some studies of stellar amplitude from the first quarter of kepler data ( e.g. @xcite ) have already begun examining how the amplitude of variability depends on @xmath183 , periodicity , and plan to investigate the age distribution of these stars once a longer time baseline is available .    in light of these upcoming developments",
    ", we use the current observations from open clusters to estimate what trends should be visible in the kepler sample . to do so , we require a conversion between rotation period and amplitude . @xcite",
    "used the clean sample of rotation periods in m37 to explore the relationship between observed amplitude of variation and rossby number . dividing their sample at ( b  v)@xmath184",
    ", the blue stars display a strong anti - correlation between rossby number ( @xmath185 ) and amplitude which flattens out for @xmath186 .",
    "redward of that division , the anti - correlation is less pronounced and the constraints on the convective overturn timescale are weaker . focusing on the bluer stars , @xcite call into question the period measurements for stars with @xmath187 , raising the possibility that they reflect spot evolution timescales rather than rotation periods .",
    "based on this , @xcite find an empirical fit to the r - band amplitude of m37 cluster members with ( b  v)@xmath188 and @xmath189 of the form @xmath190    we invert eq .",
    "[ eq : hartmanr0amplitude ] to determine the maximum observable rotation period for a survey of a given photometric precision .",
    "for some amplitude @xmath191 , the resulting @xmath185 may be converted into a rotation period if the @xmath28 is known .",
    "we perform this calculation for a grid of different stellar masses where we utilize the @xmath28 predicted by the yrec models . because @xmath28 changes only very slightly over a star s main sequence lifetime ,",
    "we adopt a mass-@xmath28 relation at 1 gyr .",
    "we restrict the grid to the range where the hartman et al .  relationship is applicable . to determine this , ( b  v ) is converted to mass using a 1 gyr , [ fe / h]@xmath192 yrec isochrone . under this transformation , the color limit ( b  v)@xmath188 corresponds to masses m@xmath193 m@xmath0 .",
    "this results in a mass - period relationship at fixed amplitude .",
    "these iso - amplitude curves represent the longest period for which a star of that mass could be detected with that photometric precision .",
    "a more slowly rotating star tends to have smaller variability in accordance with the activity - rotation - age relationship and therefore will drop below a given detection threshold .",
    "these lines of maximum period are shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : maxage ] .",
    "because older stars rotate more slowly , if a survey is unable to detect periods longer than some threshold , this places an upper limit on the age of stars that can be determined with gyrochronology for that survey .",
    "we translate the maximum rotation periods into age using the median of the rotation distribution at a grid of ages given in table [ table : gyrotable ] .",
    "the mass range of these calculations is set by where eq .",
    "[ eq : hartmanr0amplitude ] is applicable and by the scarcity of high mass stars in m37 .",
    "these maximum ages , shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : maxage ] , indicate that the current photometric precision of ground - based surveys ( 3 millimag ) limits gyrochronology to measuring stars younger than @xmath194 gyr .",
    "an improvement of a factor of 3 in precision ( @xmath195 millimag ) would open up the possibility of measuring rotation - based ages for stars as old as @xmath196 gyr .",
    "a further order of magnitude improvement in precision is required to use gyrochronology to measure the ages of stars over the full age range of the galactic disk ( up to 10 gyr ) .",
    "kepler is capable of achieving the requisite precision to do so for stars brighter than m@xmath19711 mag @xcite .",
    "the @xmath185-amplitude relationship suffers from a very limited dynamic range in @xmath185 from the m37 data .",
    "new observations of field stars will extend the relationship to larger @xmath185 ( longer rotation periods ) and provide a better constraint on the unsaturated slope .",
    "for now , we motivate a relationship with a shallower slope and consider its ramifications .",
    "this analysis is based on the @xcite best fit curve that maps @xmath185 to amplitude .",
    "some of the scatter in the m37 data is stochastic .",
    "the amplitude of variability of a star depends not only on the spot covering fraction , but also on the degree to which the spots are isotropically distributed over the surface of the star . at one extreme ,",
    "if a star had a perfectly isotropic distribution of spots , no modulation in the light curve would be observed .",
    "alternatively , large amplitude modulations would arise in the case of a concentration of spots along one line of longitude . by this logic ,",
    "the upper envelope of the amplitude-@xmath185 diagram for m37 ( see figure 17 , @xcite ) represents the maximum possible amplitude of variability for a star of a given @xmath185 .",
    "the cloud of points under this envelope could be produced by different spot configurations that decrease the amplitude of variation .",
    "if instead we had used the upper envelope , rather than the best fit through the cloud of points , to define the the transformation from @xmath185 to amplitude , visual inspection indicates that the slope of the anti - correlation would be shallower .",
    "if this is the case , then using the best - fit @xmath185-amplitude relationship would represent an underestimate of the amplitude of variability .",
    "that is , there may be older , more slowly rotating stars which exhibit higher amplitude variability than one would expect from eq .",
    "[ eq : hartmanr0amplitude ] because they possess a more favorable configuration of spots .",
    "this would enable ground - based surveys with sufficiently long time baselines to probe older ages than predicted in figure [ fig : maxage ] .",
    "conversely , stellar variability may be suppressed to arbitrarily low levels by an nearly isotropic distribution of spots and therefore one should not expect all low amplitude stars to be old .    we can perform an empirical check on these maximum period - age - sensitivity predictions using current field star data .",
    "@xcite searched for stellar variability in light curves collected by the hatnet survey for transiting extrasolar planet .",
    "this yielded rotation periods for 1568 field f , g , k , and m dwarfs . hatnet offers a photometric precision of a few millimag for @xmath198 mag and 0.01 mag for @xmath199 mag .",
    "figure 18 in @xcite compares the mass - rotation distribution for field stars detected with hatnet with those from open clusters , including m37 . at 0.7 m@xmath0 ,",
    "the field stars have rotation periods a factor of @xmath2 longer than the corresponding stars in m37 .",
    "this also agrees with @xcite s figure 17 that shows that the number of detected stars rises slowly as a function of rotation period , peaks around 20 days , and then drops off steeply to larger periods for all color bins .",
    "if hatnet can detect rotation periods of @xmath96 days or shorter , this corresponds to ages k - star ages 2 gyr or younger from interpolation on table [ table : gyrotable ] .",
    "we overplot the hatnet detection capabilities in figure [ fig : maxage ] and discover that they more closely match the curve at @xmath200 mag than the 0.01 mag curve that corresponds to the surveys detection threshold .",
    "this is an encouraging sign that our predicted detection limits are actually too pessimistic and the activity - rotation - age relationship does not fall off as steeply as equation [ eq : hartmanr0amplitude ] predicts .",
    "the results from hatnet mean that current groundbased surveys can identify populations of stars younger than 2 gyr based on their amplitude of variability alone .",
    "however , such a sample could suffer contamination from merger products or synchronized binaries that are more active than isolated field stars of the same age .",
    "additionally , the detection efficiency among slowly rotating is unknown .",
    "stars inclined pole - on to our line of sight or those at the minimum in their stellar activity cycle contribute to a non - detection fraction of stars at a given period .    in summary , current large ground - based surveys can reach a precision of 0.01 mag , and targeted open cluster campaigns have demonstrated 0.003 mag precision levels .",
    "we find that field k star populations younger than 1 and 2 gyr ( respectively ) can be detected at these levels of precision if we adopt the amplitude - rossby scaling relationship of @xcite .",
    "the field star data of @xcite detected longer periods than would be predicted based on this estimate , suggesting that ground - based surveys may be capable of finding older stars than we predicted ( 2 gyr at 0.7 m@xmath0 and 0.01 mag precision , as opposed to our 1 gyr estimate ) .",
    "much higher levels of precision , currently only possible with satellite data , are required to detect rotational modulation in old stars . with new ground - based surveys on the horizon , such as lsst and the las",
    "cumbres global telescope network , the monitoring large fractions of the sky will reveal variability for large samples of field stars . because the amplitude of variability , like rotation rate , declines with age",
    ", such surveys will be able to identify all young k stars by variability alone .",
    "a subset of active g stars will also be discovered , consisting of a very young ( @xmath201 gyr ) sample and tidally synchronized binaries .",
    "our method implicitly assumes that we can safely project the observational pattern seen in young systems into the future .",
    "there are interesting theoretical classes of models where this is not the case .",
    "for example , stars could vary in their core - envelope coupling because of differences in internal magnetic field morphology @xcite .",
    "this would lead to a persistent range in rotation rates at late ages generated by star - to - star differences in core rotation and the effective moment of inertia subject to spin down .",
    "it may not be possible to maintain a dynamo if the rotation rate becomes too long relative to the convective overturn timescale @xcite ; both spin down and starspots could simply cease in stars above some critical age for a given mass .",
    "finally , gravitational settling could induce a composition gradient sufficient to decouple the surface convection zone from the interior .",
    "there is some evidence from old open clusters @xcite that the pattern of lithium depletion stalls for systems older than a gyr ; if rotational mixing is tied to angular momentum loss @xcite , this could be evidence that there is a similar phenomenon in the torque . these questions can be addressed with _",
    "data in old open clusters and targets with known seismic ages and measured rotation rates .    interpreting rotation in field stars will also require careful consideration of observational selection effects and stellar population backgrounds .",
    "it will be difficult to detect stars observed nearly pole - on @xcite .",
    "it will also be difficult to detect solar - like stars either at the minimum of their sunspot cycle or if they are in extended maunder minimum - like epochs .",
    "what is even more challenging will be modeling the stochastic effects of the distribution of star spots on the surface and observational selection effects from the observing cadence .",
    "all of these effects conspire to produce a substantial population of non - detections , and careful work will need to be done to quantify their impact .    finally , our age estimates , as well as the body of gyrochronology work , assumes that we have a sample consisting of main sequence single stars .",
    "there will be significant background populations of tidally synchronized binaries and blue stragglers .",
    "a few percent of solar - type stars are likely to be merger products @xcite , and their rotation rates will not be simple functions of their age .",
    "subgiants may be difficult to distinguish from dwarfs , especially for f and g stars , and their rotation - age relationships will be very different from one another .",
    "all of these backgrounds will produce spurious signals when mapped onto single star relationships .",
    "finally , the metallicity dependence of spin down relationships is poorly understood because the calibrating open cluster sample has a very limited dynamic range in composition .",
    "rotation - based ages will be a welcome addition to the arsenal of age dating methods for unevolved dwarfs if they can be shown to be competitive with other techniques .",
    "the two other strongest contenders derive ages using constraints from parallax measurements or asteroseismology . for the former ,",
    "ages may be determined by comparing a star s location on the cmd to stellar interior model predictions if the distance and metal content of a star is known .",
    "gaia will provide exquisite geometric parallax measurements accurate to a few @xmath202as for @xmath203 stars .",
    "however , without helium or metallicity information , stellar isochrones suffer a degeneracy with age .",
    "in contrast , asteroseismology obtains distance - independent age estimates for dwarfs by measuring the helium content .",
    "these ages are good to 10% of a star",
    "s main sequence lifetime @xcite , making the best age constraints possible for more massive stars .",
    "we compare the expected age precision for these three techniques for a 5 gyr old star as a function of mass in figure [ fig : compareagetechniques ] .",
    "we illustrate the sensitivity of parallax - based ages to metallicity by adopting 0.1 and 0.05 dex uncertainties in [ fe / h ] , optimistically assuming perfect distance , temperature , and helium measurements . to generate these curves , we use dartmouth isochrones to determine what difference in age produces a change in luminosity equivalent to a shift of @xmath204 dex ( or 0.05 dex ) in [ fe / h ] at fixed temperature .",
    "gaia s photometric accuracy will make the precision of metallicity information the limiting source of error .",
    "the asteroseismology curve is taken to be 10% of the main sequence lifetime from the dartmouth isochrones .",
    "the rotation - based age precision at 5 gyr is taken from figure [ fig : medianageerror10 - 90 ] .    from this comparison",
    ", we see that asteroseismology potentially offers better age constraints than parallax - based techniques in the low mass regime",
    ". however , stellar pulsations may not even be detectable in low mass stars ( e.g.  @xcite ) . because both geometric parallax and asteroseismology measure ages based on changes on the nuclear timescale , both suffer higher uncertainties in low mass stars . in comparison ,",
    "figure [ fig : compareagetechniques ] demonstrates that rotation consistently offers ages good to @xmath195 gyr for stars m@xmath205 m@xmath0 .",
    "rotation - mass - age relationships are not competitive with other techniques for stars more massive than the sun and the spread in rotation is large for low mass stars . nonetheless , in an intermediate mass regime , rotation - based ages are not only competitive , but clearly the best possible age indicators available for field dwarfs .",

    "<S> our predicted rotation - mass - age relationship shows significant zero - point offsets compared to an alternative angular momentum loss law and published gyrochronology relations . </S>",
    "<S> systematic errors at the 30 percent level are permitted by current data , highlighting the need for empirical guidance . </S>",
    "<S> we identify two fundamental sources of uncertainty that limit the precision of rotation - based ages and quantify their impact . </S>",
    "<S> stars are born with a range of rotation rates , which leads to an age range at fixed rotation period . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the inherent ambiguity from the initial conditions is important for all young stars , and remains large for old stars below 0.6 m@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> latitudinal surface differential rotation also introduces a minimum uncertainty into rotation period measurements and , by extension , rotation - based ages . both models and the data from binary star systems 61 cyg and @xmath1 cen </S>",
    "<S> demonstrate that latitudinal differential rotation is the limiting factor for rotation - based age precision among old field stars , inducing uncertainties at the @xmath2 gyr level . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the relationship between variability amplitude , rotation period , and age . </S>",
    "<S> existing ground - based surveys can detect field populations with ages as old as 1  2 gyr , while space missions can detect stars as old as the galactic disk . in comparison with other techniques for measuring the ages of lower main sequence stars , including geometric parallax and asteroseismology , rotation - based ages have the potential to be the most precise chronometer for 0.6  1.0 m@xmath0 stars . </S>"
