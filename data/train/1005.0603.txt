    "we begin by introducing a generalized treatment of spin squeezing that applies equally to ensembles of spin-1/2 and also of higher - spin particles .",
    "such squeezing will be defined with respect to a coherent spin state @xcite , in which all particles are prepared in an identical single - particle spin-@xmath7 state @xmath8 .",
    "consider an orthogonal basis of the single - particle spin space that includes the state @xmath8 and also the @xmath9 states @xmath10 .",
    "we now define many - body observables @xmath11 where the summation index @xmath12 is taken over all particles in the @xmath13-particle ensemble .",
    "these spin fluctuation operators describe the subspace of spin excitations orthogonal to the coherent spin state .",
    "with respect to this uncorrelated state , these observables satisfy the commutation relations @xmath14\\rangle = 2 i n \\delta_{a , b}$ ] .",
    "thus , measurements of each pair @xmath15 independently obey an uncertainty relation @xmath16 .",
    "following the treatment of squeezing for vector spin operators , we identify one mode of spin fluctuations , labeled by @xmath17 , to be spin squeezed when the measurement variance for one quadrature of the @xmath18-@xmath19 plane is below the standard quantum limit , @xmath13 .    applying this treatment to an ensemble of spin-1/2 particles , we recall that any coherent spin state can be written as the @xmath20 eigenstate of a projection of the dimensionless vector spin . taking that projection to lie along @xmath2 , we identify the one mode of spin fluctuation operators as the pauli operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "more generally , for an ensemble of spin-@xmath7 particles prepared in the @xmath23 eigenstate of the @xmath24 spin operator , the spin fluctuation operators defined by the state @xmath25 act on @xmath8 as @xmath26 times the spin vector operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "for this one mode of spin - fluctuation operators , the commutation relation matches that of the spin - vector operators .",
    "thus , we recover the conventional description of vector - spin squeezing as pertaining to just one mode of spin fluctuations atop a maximum - spin coherent spin state .    to illustrate further the possibility of squeezing in several spin fluctuation modes , we consider spin squeezing of spin-1 particles prepared initially in the @xmath29 state .",
    "our treatment is facilitated by working in a polar state basis , where @xmath30 is the zero - eigenvalue state of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the pair of fluctuation operators defined according to the state @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) are identified as @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , where the former is a component of the quadrupole moment tensor @xcite .",
    "the coherent spin state @xmath38 is thus regarded as the uncorrelated vacuum state for independent spin fluctuations in the @xmath27-@xmath39 and the @xmath28-@xmath40 planes , and correlated states may be spin squeezed with respect to vector - spin or quadrupole - spin components , or linear combinations thereof .",
    "finally , we note that this unconventional form of spin squeezing , about the polar @xmath41 state , may be mapped directly onto the more conventional vector - spin squeezing discussed above by a unitary transformation that rotates the polar basis states onto the proper @xmath24 eigenstates ; experimentally , such generic unitary transformations upon alkali - atom hyperfine spin states are produced by rf - pulses and quadratic zeeman energy shifts @xcite .",
    "we now consider such multi - spin - mode squeezing in a spatially extended , ferromagnetic @xmath0 gaseous bose - einstein condensate where , as we show below , such squeezing is produced naturally by spin - dependent interactions @xcite .",
    "as in recent experiments @xcite , these condensed atoms ( at rest ) are prepared initially in the common spin state @xmath42 . within the volume occupied by the condensate ,",
    "we define position - space spin - fluctuation measurement densities @xmath43 where @xmath44 is now the position - space bose field operator for the polar state @xmath30 , and the index @xmath45 runs over the transverse spin polarizations .",
    "these observables represent components of the local nematicity ( rank-2 moments of the atomic spin ) and magnetization ( rank-1 moments of the atomic spin ) of the quantum gas , and obey the commutation relation @xmath46 \\right\\rangle = 2 i \\ , n({\\mathbf{r } } ) \\ , \\delta^3(\\mathbf{r } - \\mathbf{r}^\\prime ) \\delta_{a , b } $ ] where @xmath47 , and expectation values are taken with respect to the polar condensate .",
    "these measurement density operators are used to construct operators corresponding to spatially resolved measurements of particular spin fluctuations of the quantum field . defining the real measurement mode functions",
    "@xmath48 , we may define mode measurement operators as follows : @xmath49 where the common polarization index is omitted for clarity . in this definition for @xmath50 ( and similarly for @xmath51 ) , the local measurement weight is given as @xmath52 and the locally measured quadrature is defined by the angle @xmath53 .",
    "the commutation relation @xmath54 \\right\\rangle = 2 i\\ , \\int d^3\\mathbf{r } \\ ,",
    "\\left ( a d- b c\\right ) n(\\mathbf{r})\\ ] ] is non zero to the extent that the two measurement operators probe non - parallel spin - fluctuation quadratures on a common population of atoms .",
    "we see that our present treatment subsumes the commonly discussed single - mode description of spin squeezing in atomic ensembles .",
    "that is , the equal - weight sum of atomic spin operators is measured by spatial - mode operators defined with the uniform functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 . however",
    ", our treatment easily allows for a multi - mode description of spin squeezing and collective spin measurements of a spatially extended quantum field .",
    "for example , spin squeezing in a spatially resolved measurement of the atomic spin , e.g.  in the spinor - gas magnetometer of ref.@xcite , may be treated by defining measurement mode functions corresponding to every resolved pixel in the magnetization - sensitive image .",
    "our treatment applies also to optical measurements sensitive to spatially varying linear combinations of magnetization and nematicity , which are achieved by measuring different components of the linear optical susceptibility tensor @xcite .",
    "now , let us consider the evolution of the paramagnetic condensate under the quantum - coherent spin dynamics produced by the spin - dependent contact interactions between atoms @xcite . as in previous experiments , we consider the condensate to be prepared in the uncorrelated polar state and then allowed to evolve freely at a fixed value of the quadratic zeeman shift @xmath57 , which gives the difference between the average energy of the @xmath58 zeeman sublevels and that of the @xmath41 state . within the bogoliubov approximation ,",

    "the spin - mixing interactions are described through @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the density of the condensate and @xmath64 relates to the @xmath65-wave scattering lengths @xmath66 for binary collisions among atoms with total spin @xmath67 @xcite . for a ferromagnetic bose gas , @xmath68 . here , we restrict the spin excitations to the volume of the condensate .",
    "we find it convenient to consider separately the real and imaginary parts of @xmath69 , i.e.  we consider the fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which commute as @xmath72 = -2 i\\ , \\delta^3(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^\\prime)$ ] .",
    "considering the linearized equations of motion for these operators , obtained from @xmath73 given above , one identifies normal dynamical modes by defining a set of functions @xmath74 , spanning the condensate volume , as solutions to the following differential equation : @xmath75 it follows that @xmath76 and @xmath74 are real and that we may normalize the mode functions so that @xmath77 . with the aid of these functions",

    "the canonical evolution of magnon excitation mode @xmath82 is akin to that of a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath83 , with @xmath84 defining stable magnon excitations and @xmath85 defining unstable modes .",
    "the action of this canonical evolution on the initial fluctuations in each normal mode may be discerned by examining the scaled covariance matrix @xmath86 where the mode operators are scaled by their initial rms fluctuations .",
    "it is important to note that this scaling circularizes the initial fluctuations of the normal mode operators , but that these initial fluctuations do not have the minimum uncertainty .",
    "one finds , however , that the fluctuations do reach their minimum product for excitations of a homogeneous condensate and approximate the minimum product for inhomogeneous condensates with densities varying only on long length scales .",

    "the initial spin fluctuations rotate in the @xmath93-@xmath94 plane and also experience periodic , bounded dilatations and contractions .",

    "this field may be manipulated further to suit a particular metrological application .",
    "for example , spin squeezing may first be prepared at a particular wave vector @xmath128 by allowing the system to evolve for a given time at @xmath129 for which @xmath130 .",
    "thereafter , the quadratic shift may be adjusted to @xmath131 at which the spin modes at wave vector @xmath128 are dynamically stable . under such stable evolution ,",
    "the spin fluctuations undergo rotation in the @xmath115-@xmath116 plane , so that squeezing can be generated along any desired quadrature axis .",
    "more general control of the @xmath100-dependent rotation angle could be realized by applying a @xmath100-dependent optically induced quadratic zeeman shift , e.g.  by taking advantage of the band structure of an appropriately tuned and polarized optical lattice .",
    "it is illuminating to consider the evolution of a spatially extended @xmath0 quantum field in position space . the spin - dependent contact interactions to which we have ascribed the generation of a correlated quantum field act locally ; thus , we would expect spatial correlations to propagate at a finite rate across the spinor condensate .",
    "yet , the above description for the homogeneous system ( section [ sec : homo ] ) dealt with measurement observables that incorporate correlations between particles at infinite range .",
    "in contrast , given the local origin of spin correlations , we expect that spin squeezing should be effectively observed by local measurements of the collective atomic spin on a finite number of atoms .",
    "one approach to tracing the spatial evolution of spin correlations is to consider correlations among the position - space spin - fluctuation measurement densities , via the covariance matrix defined as @xmath132 for the uncorrelated condensate prepared at time @xmath97 , we have @xmath133 , i.e.  correlations are purely local . at later times , for the initially homogeneous condensate , @xmath134    now , let us inquire as to the spatial range of spin - squeezing produced by spin - dependent contact interactions by asking whether finite - volume spatial - mode operators may be defined that will capture the spin squeezing produced in a homogeneous spinor condensate .",

    "now we are in a position to consider forms of the measurement operators appropriate for capturing squeezing achieved by the spinor bose - einstein condensate amplifier .",

    "evaluating the correlation matrix , we now find fluctuations of the @xmath148 operator are squeezed with respect to their variance at @xmath97 .",
    "an estimate for the squeezing achieved using the quadrature - tuned mode function may be obtained analytically . if we assume that @xmath149 , then the reduction in the variance is given approximately as @xmath150 that is , the spin correlations produced in the quenched spinor bose - einstein condensate are indeed local , contained within a volume that grows diffusively in time .",

    "@xcite , and such amplification was found to be roughly consistent with quantum - limited amplification of quantum fluctuations in the initial state , with a gain , measured by the increase in the variance of spin fluctuations , as high as + 30 db .",
    "in contrast to previous studies on the parametric amplification of spin fluctuations @xcite , here we have considered the squeezing that may accompany such amplification .",
    "we assume experimental conditions similar to those of refs.@xcite , i.e.  an optically trapped @xmath0 @xmath6rb condensate of @xmath173 atoms with peak density @xmath174 . at this density ,",
    "the characteristic time scale for spin mixing in the spinor condensate is @xmath175 and the characteristic length scale is @xmath176 .",
    "let us estimate the maximum observable degree of spin squeezing , taking into account non - linearities , atom loss , and the spatial inhomogeneity of the condensate .",
    "thus far , we have treated spin dynamics in a quenched @xmath0 spinor condensate exclusively through the bogoliubov approximation ( equation [ eq : hspinbogo ] ) , i.e.  neglecting high - order terms in the spin fluctuation operators and also the depletion of the @xmath41 condensate due to spin mixing . within this linear , undepleted - pump approximation",
    ", we obtain the unphysical result , expressed in equation [ eq : spmkappa ] , that the minimum spin - quadrature variance @xmath126 in each unstable spin mode tends exponentially to zero . as in quantum - optical systems , sensible limits to squeezing are recovered by going beyond the linearized equations of motion and the undepleted - pump approximation .",
    "these limits are partly elucidated in the full dynamics of a single spin mode .",

    "we have performed numerical calculations including such terms , representing quantum noise in the evolution of a classical field as in the truncated wigner approximation ( twa ) @xcite . in accord with experimental observations , we assume an initial per - atom loss rate of 1 @xmath185 .",
    "we find squeezing in a @xmath186 atom sample can still be the level of -20 db , a result that is not surprising given the very short spin - mixing time as compared to the lifetime of trapped atoms .",

    "temporal evolution is thereafter considered according to classical wave equations , which include the full non - linear dynamics given by spin - mixing hamiltonian ( the non - linear schrdinger equation ) and also the effects of atom loss ( through additional noise and loss terms , described above ) .",

    "we apply analytic and numerical tools to determine that measurable spin squeezing better than 20 db may be achieved in such systems .    this treatment is relevant also to the question of symmetry breaking in a quantum many - body system .",
    "an initially polar - state spinor bose - einstein condensate preserves the @xmath200 rotational symmetry about the alignment axis .",
    "the quantum quench considered in this work , a rapid reduction in the quadratic zeeman shift to induce dynamical instabilities and parametric amplification of spin fluctuations , traverses the atomic system across a symmetry - breaking quantum phase transition , where the spin - dependent contact interactions favor broken symmetry states of maximum magnetization @xcite . in a closed noiseless quantum system",
    ", bona fide symmetry breaking does not occur ; rather , the system evolves coherently to a symmetric superposition of broken - symmetry states .",
    "the spin - squeezed states described in this work indeed represent such a coherent superposition .",
    "the metrological significance of spin squeezed quantum fields , and also the question of symmetry breaking in quantum systems , provide strong motivation for the detection and characterization of squeezing in quenched spinor bose gases .",
    "for this purpose , spatially resolved measurements of the magnetization of optically trapped condensates have been demonstrated @xcite , and optical means of measuring components of both the magnetization and the nematicity have been suggested @xcite .",
    "however , sensitivity below the atomic shot noise level , required for the direct detection of squeezing , is experimentally challenging and was not achieved in those measurements .",
    "alternately , we propose that one could use the condensate itself as a pre - measurement amplifier . following the generation of inhomogeneous spin squeezing with the quadratic shift at @xmath201 , one may quickly increase the quadratic zeeman shift .",
    "the previously unstable dynamical modes now evolve stably as the squeezed and amplified spin - fluctuation quadratures rotate in their quadrature spaces .",
    "after their rotation , the spin fluctuations may be again parametrically amplified by returning the quadratic shift to @xmath201 .",
    "spin squeezing produced by the first stage of amplification would result in a reduction of spin fluctuations observed after the second amplification stage , as compared to a single - stage amplification of vacuum spin noise .",

    "<S> investigations of spin squeezing in ensembles of quantum particles have been limited primarily to a subspace of spin fluctuations and a single spatial mode in high - spin and spatially extended ensembles . here , we show that a wider range of spin - squeezing is attainable in ensembles of high - spin atoms , characterized by sub - quantum - limited fluctuations in several independent planes of spin - fluctuation observables . </S>",
    "<S> further , considering the quantum dynamics of an @xmath0 ferromagnetic spinor bose - einstein condensate , we demonstrate theoretically that a high degree of spin squeezing is attained in multiple spatial modes of a spatially extended quantum field , and that such squeezing can be extracted from spatially resolved measurements of magnetization and nematicity , i.e.  the vector and quadrupole magnetic moments , of the quantum gas . taking into account several experimental limitations , we predict that the variance of the atomic magnetization and nematicity may be reduced as far as 20 db below the standard quantum limits .    </S>",

    "<S> ensemble states of uncorrelated particles are limited by the standard quantum limited variance , @xmath4 , achieved by partitioning the minimum measurement uncertainties equally between the two vector spin projections .    </S>",
    "<S> this form of _ vector operator _ spin squeezing describes present experiments not only on pseudo - spin 1/2 atomic gases , i.e.  where each atom is restricted to just two internal @xcite or external @xcite states , but also on gases of higher - spin atoms ( e.g.  the @xmath5 hyperfine - state manifold of cs @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> we go beyond existing treatments of spin squeezing by evaluating such squeezing in an ensemble that is explicitly higher - dimensional not only in its spin degrees of freedom , but also in its spatial degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation is motivated by two experimental results : the controlled amplification of spin noise in @xmath6rb quantum fluids @xcite , and the use of a spinor bose - einstein condensate as a spatially resolving magnetometer @xcite . as we discuss herein , these two results , respectively , provide a complete means for inducing squeezing of both the spin vector and quadrupole moments of the @xmath0 quantum gas , and also a means of applying the subsequent spatially extended non - classical quantum fluid toward spatially resolved magnetometry with sub shot - noise sensitivity . </S>"
