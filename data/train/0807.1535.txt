    "stellar and gas dynamical studies have proven to be the most secure method of measuring the masses of supermassive black holes in nearby galaxies , and black holes with masses of @xmath11@xmath12 @xmath1  have now been detected in a few dozen galaxies ( see ferrarese & ford 2005 for a recent review ) . with just a few exceptions ,",
    "however , stellar - dynamical and gas - dynamical techniques for black hole mass measurement can not be applied to seyfert galaxies and quasars , because most luminous active galaxies are too distant for their black hole s gravitational sphere of influence to be resolved .",
    "most black hole mass estimates in broad - lined active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are based on indirect methods that rely on scaling relations resulting from reverberation - mapping data @xcite . using these methods ,",
    "it has recently become possible to search for active galaxies having extremely low - mass black holes , in order to extend our understanding of black hole demographics to objects having black hole masses of @xmath13 @xmath1 .",
    "the best nearby example of a black hole in the @xmath14 @xmath1  mass range is that in the dwarf seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  4395 @xcite .",
    "ngc  4395 is an essentially bulgeless , late - type dwarf galaxy with type 1 seyfert characteristics such as broad emission lines @xcite and rapid x - ray variability @xcite .",
    "located at a distance of only @xmath15  mpc @xcite , it is an excellent target for multiwavelength observations despite the tiny luminosity of its central engine ( @xmath16 ergs  s@xmath7 ; moran et al .",
    "a recent ultraviolet ( uv ) reverberation - mapping measurement found @xmath17  @xmath18  @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "@xcite searched the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) archives to find agns with low - mass black holes and have found numerous examples of seyfert 1 galaxies with @xmath19 @xmath1 , which we will refer to as the gh sample .",
    "however , most of the sdss objects found by greene & ho are much more distant than ngc 4395 , making detailed studies of their nuclei and host galaxies more difficult .",
    "although the gh sample does contain examples of agns in low - mass disk galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc 4395 remains an exceptional case due to its extreme late - type morphology as well as its proximity .",
    ", also known as g1200 - 2038 or pgc 038055 ( @xmath20 mpc for @xmath21 km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 ) , is an interesting counterpart to ngc  4395 .",
    "it was originally discovered in an objective prism study by @xcite , who classified it as a dwarf disk galaxy with a seyfert 2 nucleus , but noted the presence of a weak broad component of the h@xmath8  line . @xcite re - observed pox 52 , classifying it as a type 1 agn based on clear detections of broad h@xmath22  and h@xmath8  and noting that its optical emission - line spectrum is nearly identical to that of ngc 4395 . both ngc 4395 and pox 52 can be classified as narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies , since they satisfy the defining criterion of having fwhm(h@xmath8)@xmath23 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "nls1 galaxies are often , but not always , characterized by strong emission and relatively weak [ ] emission when compared to h@xmath8 along with steep soft ( @xmath24 kev ) spectral slopes and rapid variability in the x - ray @xcite .",
    "ngc  4395 and pox  52 are therefore somewhat atypical nls1 galaxies in that they have very high - excitation spectra with large [ ] /h@xmath8  ratios and very weak emission .    using the virial scaling relation calibrated by @xcite , barth et al .",
    "estimated a black hole mass of @xmath25 @xmath1 , making this one of the least massive black holes identified in any agn .",
    "this mass is consistent with the mass expected based on the @xmath26  relation ( extrapolated to small @xmath27 ) for the measured stellar velocity dispersion @xmath28 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "they also estimated the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath29  @xmath30 ergs  s@xmath7 ) and the eddington ratio ( @xmath29/@xmath31  @xmath32 ) for pox  52 .",
    "thus , although pox  52 and ngc  4395 have very similar black hole masses and emission - line spectra that are nearly identical in appearance , the agn in pox  52 is @xmath33 times more luminous than that in ngc  4395 , which has an estimated @xmath29/@xmath31  @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used ground - based images to study the morphology of pox  52 and found that the host galaxy was best fit with a srsic  model with an index of @xmath35 , effective radius of @xmath36 , and absolute magnitude @xmath37 .",
    "combined with @xmath27  measured from the spectrum , these results show pox  52 to fall near the dwarf elliptical sequence @xcite in the fundamental plane projections of @xcite , making it the first example of a dwarf elliptical to host a seyfert nucleus . although the past few years have seen a large increase in the number of known agns with low - mass black holes , pox  52 remains a valuable target for further study , because of its relatively small distance and the fact that it is a less luminous and presumably less massive galaxy than the majority of the host galaxies in the gh sdss sample .    among nearby dwarf ellipticals ,",
    "there is little evidence for the presence of central black holes .",
    "the closest well - studied example is ngc 205 in the local group , and stellar - dynamical observations with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ have set an upper limit to the black hole mass of @xmath38 @xmath1  @xcite , which is below the mass expected from a simple extrapolation of the @xmath26  relation . for dwarf",
    "elliptical galaxies outside the local group , stellar - dynamical observations lack the spatial resolution needed to detect black holes , and agn surveys are the best available alternative for black hole searches .",
    "a double nucleus in one virgo dwarf elliptical galaxy has been interpreted as morphological evidence for a stellar disk in orbit around a central black hole @xcite , but aside from ngc  205 there are essentially no direct observational constraints on the black hole occupation fraction in dwarf elliptical galaxies .",
    "pox  52 represents a unique opportunity to study , in depth , the unambiguous presence of a low - mass central black hole in a nearby dwarf elliptical galaxy .    here",
    ", we present new multiwavelength observations of pox 52 , including the first targeted _ hst_and x - ray observations of this unusual object . _",
    "images are used to examine the host galaxy morphology ; our results confirm the previous conclusions that the galaxy is consistent with a dwarf elliptical morphology with a srsic  index of @xmath39 .",
    "we describe x - ray observations obtained with both the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  x - ray observatories in order to study the temporal and spectral properties of the active nucleus , and to constrain its bolometric luminosity and black hole mass .",
    "we also include observations from the very large array ( vla ) and _ spitzer _ infrared spectrometer ( irs ) , as well as archival data from 2mass and _ galex _ , in order to investigate the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of pox 52 over a wide range in frequency .",
    "we use recently updated versions of the broad - line virial scaling relations to obtain new estimates of the mass of the black hole , and in combination with the multiwavelength sed we determine the bolometric luminosity and eddington ratio for the agn .",
    "in addition to the _ hst _  data presented here , we were also awarded time as part of the same project to obtain ultraviolet and optical spectra of pox 52 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , but stis failed before the observations were scheduled to be taken .",
    "observations of pox 52 were made on 2004 november 18 ut with _ hst _  using the high resolution camera ( hrc ) on acs .",
    "four images of 590 s each were taken through the f814w ( _ i_-band ) filter and four images of 622 s each were taken through the f435w ( _ b_-band ) filter .",
    "these images were dithered using a 4-point box pattern with 015 spacing to enable the removal of cosmic ray hits and bad pixels .",
    "an additional 100 s image was taken in each filter in the event that the nucleus saturated in the longer exposures , though this saturation did not occur in any image .",
    "the images for each filter were combined using the multidrizzle task in pyraf ( version 1.3 ) to remove cosmic ray hits and to correct for the acs geometric distortion , and the output images were not sky subtracted or rotated during this processing .",
    "these _ hst _  images ( figure [ image - panel ] ) show pox 52 as a bright point source centered in a smooth host galaxy with no obvious signs of spiral structure in either filter .    the two - dimensional fitting program galfit ( version 2.1d , peng et al .",
    "2002 ) was used to model the host galaxy morphology . the central point source in the center of the host galaxy",
    "was modeled by a point spread function ( psf ) image , and the host galaxy itself was modeled by a srsic  component , or combination of srsic  components .",
    "since the sky background was not subtracted in the image processing , a sky component was also used within each galaxy model .",
    "all magnitudes are in the vegamag system calculated using the zeropoints calibrated for hrc , which are 25.188 for f435w and 24.861 for f814w , and corrected for galactic extinction using the iraf package _ synphot _ for @xmath40 mag @xcite .      the psf image used in the galfit modeling",
    "can either be created synthetically from a program such as tiny tim @xcite or cropped from a data image using the same detector and filter set as the object being modeled . both methods were tested in order to determine the most appropriate psf for our analysis .",
    "we began by creating a synthetic psf for each filter using tiny tim .",
    "we centered the psf in the same position as the point source in our galaxy images in order to properly reproduce the geometric changes involved in the multidrizzle process .",
    "these psf images were then multidrizzled in the same manner as the object data , since the tiny tim psfs created for hrc include the geometric distortions in raw hrc images , and therefore must be subject to the same corrections to undistort the images . in order to evaluate how well the tiny tim psf compares to the psf of a star observed with hrc , we searched the archive for unsaturated images of _ hst _  standard stars observed in the f814w and f435w filters , finding three that matched our criteria : , , and .",
    "table [ psfstar ] lists the observation dates and exposure times of these three white dwarf stars , in which they were located near the center of the ccd .",
    "the specific observations were chosen to bracket the pox 52 observation in order to minimize any changes to the psf over time , with the average observation occurring 6 months from that of pox 52 .",
    "all of the psf star images were processed through multidrizzle in the same manner as our pox 52 data with the exception that the standard star images were sky - subtracted during the multidrizzle process in order to be used as input psf images with galfit .",

    "can we examine how the shape of the psf changes for different stars ( due to color and/or ccd location ) , but the existence of multiple observations of each of these stars in the _ hst _   archive allows us to determine the extent of changes to the psf over time .",

    "the three left panels are profiles from the three different stars found in the _ hst _  archive .",
    "one can see how the shape of the psf s central peak can vary depending on the star used .",
    "the two observations of gd71 were taken about a year and a half apart .",
    "there is not a large change in the psf shape during this time period , but small differences are apparent .",
    "the differences in profile shapes are more apparent in the f435w filter , showing tiny tim has more difficulty modeling a psf in this filter .",
    "the tiny tim f435w psf tends to have a flatter inner core , leaving a @xmath41  mag  arcsec@xmath42 residual out to @xmath43 . in the acs / hrc camera about @xmath44 of the psf flux at long wavelengths ( @xmath45   ) scatters into a halo surrounding the psf core making psf modeling more difficult in red passbands @xcite , such as the f814w filter . the halo radius increases with wavelength , and tiny tim attempts to model its wavelength - dependent structure .",
    "despite the red halo ( seen as the bump at @xmath46 in figure [ ttmodel ] ) and the variations seen between the stellar psfs , tiny tim did a reasonable job modeling each of the standard stars in the f814w filter , with few significant deviations between the shape of the tiny tim psf and that of the observed star .",
    "since the tiny tim psfs reasonably fit the central regions of the observed stars in both filters and have the advantage of being noise - free , we selected the corresponding tiny tim psf to use in the galfit modeling of pox 52 .",
    "we fit the f814w hrc image of pox 52 over a @xmath47 arcsec@xmath48 ( @xmath49 pixel ) region with a simple model consisting of an agn point source and a single srsic  component , where all parameters ( including position and magnitude for both the point source and srsic   components and effective radius , srsic  index , axis ratio , and position angle for the srsiccomponent ) were allowed to vary",

    "the residuals after subtracting the model from the galaxy image are shown in the far right panel .",
    "the strong residuals in the center of the image are mostly confined to the psf - dominated region at @xmath53 and are likely to be the result of psf mismatch , but the weaker residuals seen further out from the psf - dominated region of the galaxy could indicate small - scale structure in the host galaxy .",
    "we added a second srsic  component to the model in an attempt to minimize the residuals , but it made little difference in the overall fit .",
    "the additional srsic  component closely followed that of the psf component , leaving the original srsic  component to trace the host galaxy as before .",

    "parameters for this fit and the f435w fits can be seen in table [ galfitt ] .",

    "we note a difference in terminology between what some authors call a dwarf elliptical galaxy @xcite and a different designation , spheroidals , in order to distinguish the typically less centrally concentrated objects from low - luminosity versions of classical ellipticals @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we refer to these galaxies as dwarf ellipticals for consistency with the nomenclature adopted in our earlier paper @xcite .    from our galfit decompositions",

    "the structure of the inner region of the host galaxy remains complicated due to the second srsic  component needed to provide a reasonable fit in the f435w filter .",
    "we noted earlier that the inner srsic  component seems to be compensating mostly for the psf mismatch , but its broader profile suggests the possibility of a spatially compact , blue component , such as a nuclear star cluster .",
    "looking at the @xmath217 color of pox  52 with and without the inner srsiccomponent included , we can bracket the range of possible colors of the host galaxy . excluding the inner srsic  component , we find @xmath218 for the host galaxy , which is similar to fiducial values ( @xmath219 ) for s0/sab galaxies found in @xcite and from _ synphot _ calculations ( @xmath220 ) with the @xcite s0/sab galaxy templates .",
    "if we assume that the compact component is entirely due to starlight , the resulting color of @xmath221 is bluer than both the @xcite fiducial value for i m galaxies ( @xmath222)and all of the starburst galaxy templates ( @xmath223 ) from @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the inner srsic  component in the f435w image must contain a substantial amount of light from the agn point source",

    "x - ray spectral variability is not an unusual occurrence in an agn , but is normally manifested in small changes in the spectral slope or in the width or amplitude of an emission line . strong variability in the absorbing column density is more rare , but is often attributed to partial covering . in this scenario , there exists a patchy absorber surrounding the agn made up of many smaller gas clouds orbiting the central engine with close to keplerian velocities .",
    "the variations seen in column density are therefore related to the number of clouds along the line of sight .",
    "this has become a common model to use when a change in the spectral slope on the soft end is observed , as has been seen in several nls1 galaxies , including iras  13224 - 3809 @xcite , rx  j2217.9 - 5941 @xcite , mrk  335 @xcite , mrk  1239 @xcite , and 1h  0707 - 495 @xcite .",

    "mrk  335 has regularly been studied in the x - rays since 1971 with no dramatic changes in flux until 2007 , when @xcite measured a factor of 30 decrease in flux compared to all previous observations . when the spectra were modeled , grupe et al .",
    "were unable to obtain a good fit with scaled - down versions of previously used models and found that adding a partial covering model to an absorbed power law with a high partial covering fraction of @xmath224 , much like that of pox 52 , enabled an acceptable fit .",
    "when corrected for this additional absorption , the change in intrinsic luminosity is only a factor of @xmath225 when compared to earlier observations .",
    "grupe et al .",
    "note that a partial covering model can also reasonably fit their 2006 data with a lower partial covering fraction of @xmath226 , but does not result in the best fit for their 2000 data .",
    "this suggests the partial covering absorber was moving into the line of sight as early as 2006 .    assuming the sizes of these discrete absorbing clouds do not vary much from one source to another , and that the accretion disks and surrounding x - ray - emitting regions of less massive black holes like pox 52 are ,",
    "in fact , scaled - down versions of those associated with their more massive counterparts , one would expect the x - ray absorbing region to be less voluminous and therefore contain fewer absorbing clouds .",
    "furthermore , if the differences in column density are attributed to the number of clouds instead of the size of clouds , it is possible that an x - ray - emitting region surrounding a black hole the size of pox 52 would have a higher likelihood of being observed with almost no absorbing clouds in the line of sight than for a more massive source due to the differences in the number of clouds associated with each source .",
    "the black hole in pox 52 is @xmath69 orders of magnitude less massive than that in mrk 335 @xcite and moved from an unabsorbed state to the partial covering state in less than 9 months , whereas the change in absorbing column in mrk  335 occurred over @xmath227 years @xcite .",

    "agns are highly variable in x - rays and with good data sampling , one can study the frequency dependence of these variations by computing the power spectrum density ( psd ) , which is a measure of the amount of variability at a given frequency .",
    "the psds of agns and seyferts are often fit with a combination of two power laws with a slope of @xmath246 at the high - frequency end and then breaking to a slope of @xmath247 at the low - frequency end .",
    "the frequency at which this change occurs is known as the break frequency , @xmath248 , and appears to correlate inversely with black hole mass @xcite .",

    "this fit is good enough that a broken power law fit is not justified .",
    "to test whether any constraints on @xmath248 could be derived , we attempted to fit a broken power law to the data .",
    "unfortunately , all attempts at fitting the data while allowing parameters to vary freely produced either a break frequency outside the range of our data or a broken power law with no break , and the result is that both power law models had identical slopes . arbitrarily forcing a specific break frequency produced fits to the data with low - frequency slopes of @xmath252 and high - frequency slopes of @xmath253 , neither of which approximate the expected slopes of @xmath247 and @xmath246 seen in most agns and seyferts . from this",
