    "referred to the center - of - mass system of the projectile , the transferred momentum is @xmath0 . for the knockout reactions in the sudden approximation , this must equal the momentum of the struck nucleon before the collision .",
    "the standard reaction models assume that the ground state of the projectile of spin and parity @xmath1 can be approximated by a superposition of configurations of the form @xmath2^{j^{\\pi}}$ ] where @xmath3 denote the core states and the @xmath4 are the quantum numbers for the single particle wave functions in a spherical mean field potential .",
    "the measured partial cross sections to individual final levels @xmath5 of the core allow to extract , by comparison with theoretical calculations , the spectroscopic factors for the individual core - single particle configurations . in complete analogy to the use of angular distributions in transfer reactions ,",
    "the orbital angular momentum @xmath6 is revealed by the shape of the momentum distributions @xmath7 .",
    "it is obvious then that the accuracy of the extracted spectroscopic factors , a measure of the occupancy of the single - particle orbitals in nuclei , and the conclusions that may follow from these spectroscopic factors about correlations inside nuclei depend in direct measure on the accuracy of the cross section calculations .",
    "similarly , the cross sections for one - proton removal reactions @xmath8 are directly related to the non - resonant part of the astrophysical s - factors for the inverse radiative proton capture y(p,@xmath9)x ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . again",
    ", the results and their reliability depend directly on the reliability and accuracy of the reaction calculations ( as discussed in @xcite ) .    the one - nucleon removal cross section is calculated in most reaction models as an incoherent sum of the contributions of all core - single particle configurations making the ground state of the fast moving projectile : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the spectroscopic factors of each configuration and the single particle removal cross section , respectively @xcite .",
    "a similar relation is valid for momentum distributions .",
    "systematic studies of projectiles and reactions allow the determination of the ordering , spacing and the occupancy of orbitals , essential in assessing how nuclei evolve in the presence of large neutron or proton excess .",
    "much was done in this respect in the last decade in various laboratories .",
    "this information can be compared to many - body nuclear structure calculations which are now able to reproduce the measured masses , charge radii and low - lying excited states of a large number of nuclei .",
    "it was found that , e.g. , for very exotic nuclei , the small additional stability that comes with the filling of a particular orbital can have profound effects upon their existence as bound systems , their lifetime and structure , and lead to the discovery of magic numbers that do not manifest along the valley of stability .",
    "extensions of the nucleon knockout formalism including the treatment of final - state interactions have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is shown that coulomb final - state interactions are of relevance . in the meantime , inclusion of higher - order effects @xcite and a theory for two - nucleon knockout @xcite have been developed .",
    "knockout reactions represent a particular case for which higher projectile energies allow a simpler theoretical treatment of the reaction mechanism , due to the simplicity of the reaction mechanism and the assumption of a single - step process .    a microscopic approach to direct reactions uses an effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction ( e.g. those of ref .",

    "@xcite , where the procedure starts from a nn effective interaction with independent real and imaginary parts . for collisions at high energies ( @xmath13 ) , it is possible to show that instead of nucleon - nucleon interactions one can use nucleon - nucleon cross sections as the microscopic input @xcite . in this case ,",
    "an effective treatment of pauli - blocking of nucleon - nucleon scattering is needed , as it manifests through medium modification of nucleon - nucleon cross sections .",
    "it is well known that medium modification of the nucleon - nucleon cross sections is necessary for an adequate numerical modeling of heavy - ion collision dynamics in central collisions . in these collisions ,",
    "the ultimate purpose is to extract information about the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) by studying global collective variables describing the collision process . in direct reactions , such as one - nucleon removal reactions , medium effects of nn scattering",
    "are smaller because mostly low nuclear densities are probed .",
    "a first study of this effect in knockout reactions was carried out in ref .",
    "nonetheless , no comparison with experimental data was provided . in this work",
    "we explore further consequences of medium corrections and final state interactions in knockout reactions .",
    "we study medium effects in the nn cross section in knockout reactions using the methods reported in ref .",

    "we also explore the effect of final state interaction , in particular the effects of coulomb distortion in the entrance and final reaction channels .",
    "this is of relevance as an increasing number of experiments use heavy targets with a large nuclear charge .",

    "we have to emphasize that the shaded areas in fig .",

    "we consider the simplest and most straightforward correction one can do , namely the inclusion of a coulomb phase , which accounts for the distortion of the elastic scattering of the core fragment .",
    "it has been usually taken for granted that longitudinal momentum distributions are little affected by elastic scattering of the core fragment , the reason being that the longitudinal forces acting on the core fragment reverse sign as the projectile passes by the target , leading to a reduced distortion effect @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the transverse momentum distributions are strongly affected by both nuclear and coulomb elastic scattering . for heavier targets the distortions are predominantly due to coulomb repulsion @xcite .",

    "we show that these argumentations are not always valid and need to be studied with care .    as discussed in the previous section , in the presence of the coulomb field the eikonal s - matrices factorize as the product of the nuclear and the coulomb contributions : @xmath60 .",
    "although this does not make any difference for the total stripping cross sections ( see eq .",
    "( 20 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it has an impact on the diffraction dissociation cross section ( through the second term of eq .",
    "( 21 ) of ref .",
    "this means that not only transverse , but also longitudinal momentum distributions will be affected by the coulomb field .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig02 ] for the longitudinal momentum distributions of several systems which we will consider in details later in this section .",
    "it is evident from the upper panels of this figure that longitudinal momentum distributions in knockout reactions t(@xmath52c,@xmath31b)x ( and their total cross sections ) are strongly influenced by the coulomb field of the target t at bombarding energies of 35  mev / nucleon .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) curves are calculations with ( without ) the inclusion of coulomb scattering .",

    "we artificially vary the binding energy of the proton in @xmath52c and in @xmath35al . as the separation energy increases",
    "so does the percent difference of the cross section , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the cross section without the coulomb scattering phases . with increasing separation energy",
    "the relative valence nucleon - core distance decreases and the nucleon removal cross section decreases , but the relative importance of the coulomb scattering increases . for very small energies the effects of coulomb dissociation ( not considered here ) should also become relevant and increase the magnitude of the cross sections .",
    "the relative importance of the coulomb scattering for the removal cross sections decreases with the bombarding energy .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig03 ] with the calculation for @xmath27c(@xmath35al,@xmath33 mg ) at 50 mev / u ( dotted curve ) .",
    "these preliminary discussions support our conclusion that both medium effects and coulomb distortion play a relevant role in knockout reactions .",

    "the @xmath69 wave functions for the valence proton were generated in a spherical woods - saxon ( ws ) potential with the parameters given in table [ bound ] .    in the optical limit of the glauber theory and the t-@xmath41 approximation ( explained in detail in refs .",

    "[ fig01 ] that @xmath52c has the smallest  effective \" size and that @xmath54be has the biggest size among the low energy systems in this study .",
    "the nuclear size is important for low energy cases because the diffraction dissociation becomes dominant when the nuclear size is smaller , but the stripping becomes dominant when the nuclear size is bigger .",
    "the reason for this is that a large projectile feels the nuclear interaction already at large impact parameters .",
    "a small projectile can come closer to the target where the coulomb interaction is larger . the evidence of this can be seen in table [ cross ] .",

    "the calculation is in agreement with the data when it is multiplied by @xmath62=1.74(19 ) .",

    "the cross sections were calculated from the relation @xmath90,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 has been calculated using eqs .",
    "( [ sib],[eikphase],[fnn ] ) and the carbon matter density from a hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculation @xcite .",
    "several distinct calculations are shown . the solid curve uses eq . with the free nucleon - nucleon cross sections and the carbon matter density from a hfb calculation @xcite , whereas the triangle - dotted curve ( the triangles are not data , but used for better visibility ) uses a different hfb density @xcite , consistent with the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . as expected , that the agreement between the two calculations is very good .",
    "the other curves in figure [ fig10 ] show the same calculation procedure , but including medium corrections for the nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "the results are evidently very different than the previous ones .",
    "the dotted ( dashed - dotted ) [ dashed ] curves use phenomenological ( brueckner ) [ pauli geometrical ] recipes for medium effects on the cross sections . based on the large error bars and spread of the experimental data , it is hard to judge what model adopted for medium corrections yields the best agreement with the data .",
    "it is clear that the inclusion of medium effects change the results to yield a closer reproduction of the data .",
    "these findings are in agreement with our present understanding of medium modifications of the reaction cross sections and of several other reaction channels involving heavy ion scattering at intermediate energies ( @xmath92 mev / nucleon ) .",
    "often neglected effects , such as medium modifications of the nucleon - nucleon cross sections and coulomb distortion , modify appreciably the nucleon knockout cross sections . as we have shown , these effects do not lead to an appreciable modification of the shapes of momentum distributions .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the momentum distributions are largely the fourier transforms of the contributing parts of the single - particle wavefunctions , overwhelmingly their asymptotic regions , which are the whittaker functions for protons or the hankel functions for neutrons , sensitive only to the orbital momentum and the nucleon binding energies .",
    "we have shown these features explicitly by comparing our results with a large number of available experimental data . as expected on physics grounds , these corrections are larger for experiments at lower energies , around 50  mev / nucleon , and for heavy targets .",
    "as more experiments make use of heavier targets , it is worthwhile to illustrate the relevance of coulomb corrections .",
    "medium effects in knockout reactions have also been frequently ignored in the past .",
    "we show that they also have to be included in order to obtain a better accuracy of the extracted spectroscopic factors .",
    "although these conclusions might not come as a big surprise , they have not been properly included in many previous experimental analyses .",
