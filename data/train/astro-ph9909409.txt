    "the nearby multiple system gl  866 has attracted considerable attention over the last decade , as it comprises some of the coolest dwarfs for which dynamic masses have been measured . at d=3.45  pc ( van altena et al .",
    "1995 ) the gl  866 system ( @xmath0=22:38:34 ; @xmath1=-15:18:02 ; eq=2000.0 ) is a very close neighbour of ours , with an m5.5v joint spectral type ( henry et al .",
    "leinert et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and mccarthy et al .",
    "( 1987 ) independently discovered it to be a binary from ir 1-d speckle observations , as well as blazit et al .",
    "( 1987 ) from visible speckle observations .",
    "leinert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) first determined the elements of the orbit ( p=2.2 years ) from three years of speckle observations , and heintz ( 1993 ) used astrometric measurements to improve the period to p=2.27 years .",
    "leinert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) derived an accurate ( @xmath25% ) total mass for the system , which however was too large for the measured luminosities . for the last few years , and",
    "at least amongst very low mass star observers , it has been common knowledge that the brighter component of the 0.35  pair is itself a short period binary ( gl  866  ac ) , though the paternity of this discovery is unclear and , to our knowledge , any paper claim it .",
    "this resolves the mass discrepancy identified by leinert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .    in this letter we present new radial velocity and angular separation measurements , which we use to determine substantially improved elements for the outer orbit , together with first orbital elements for the inner one .",
    "we then proceed to briefly discuss the mass - luminosity relation for the bottom of the main sequence , in the light of the derived masses .",
    "radial velocity measurements were obtained with the elodie spectrograph ( baranne et al .",
    "1996 ) on the 1.93 m telescope of the observatoire de haute provence ( france ) between september 1995 and july 1999 .",
    "this fixed configuration dual - fiber - fed echelle spectrograph covers in a single exposure the 390 - 680  nm spectral range , at an average resolving power of 42000 .",
    "the spectra were analysed by numerical cross - correlation with an m4v binary ( i.e. 0/1 ) mask , as described by delfosse et al .",
    "( 1999a ) . with this setup gl  866",
    "is a clear triple - lined system , with relative depths for the three well separated correlation peaks of @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath21% ( figure [ correlation ] ) .",
    "the individual radial velocities have typical accuracies of 50 - 80  @xmath3 for the two brighter components and 200 - 500  @xmath3 for the fainter one .",
    "our orbital analysis largely relies on the numerous speckle measurements of the gl  866 system obtained by leinert et al .",
    "we have also obtained one angular separation measurement at the 3.6-m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) with the adaptive optics bonnette adaptive system pueo ( rigaut et al . 1998 ) and the kir infrared camera ( doyon et al . 1998 ) : @xmath4 and @xmath5 on july 23@xmath6 1998 , delfosse et al .",
    "( 1999a ) provide a detailed description of the observing and analysis procedure , which we do nt repeat here .",
    "as the maximum separation between components a and c is @xmath20.010  ( section 3 ) , all separation observations to date , whether speckle , adaptive optics or with hst ( henry et al . 1999 ) , only resolve the ac photocenter from the b components .",
    "we have used the orbit program ( forveille et al .",
    "1999 ) to determine the elements of both orbits through a least square adjustment to all available observations , including the trigonometric parallax of 0.2943@xmath70.0035  ( van altena et al .",
    "orbit directly supports triple systems ( as well as symetrical quadruples ) , as long as three - body effects can be neglected .",
    "we have not used the individual velocities but instead made use of a recent improvement to orbit ( see forveille et al .",
    "1999 for details ) to directly adjust the orbits to the cross - correlation profiles .",
    "this direct adjustment to the profiles significantly improves the accuracy of the orbital parameters , since , for n spectroscopic measurements , it effectively removes @xmath22@xmath8(n-1 ) free parameters per spectroscopic component .",
    "this gain is particularly important for gl  866 , whose three correlation peaks blend for many velocity configurations , and whose weaker c component is sometimes only detected with a moderate signal - to - noise ratio .    in this process",
    "we produce directly a final orbit and not a intermediate radial velocity and we can not make available they , but we publish the individual radial velocity ( available in the electronic form of this paper ) obtained by classical gaussian fits of the correlation dips .",
    "we plan to send directly ( by e - mail ) our profile corelation at all people interested to work directly with them .",
