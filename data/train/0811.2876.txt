    "current experimental evidence indicates that gravitational physics is in agreement with einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) to considerable accuracy ( for thorough discussions see @xcite ) ; however , quite fundamental questions suggest that it is unlikely that gr stands as the ultimate description of gravity .",
    "actually , difficulties arise from various corners , most particularly in connection to the strong gravitational field regime and the existence of spacetime singularities .",
    "quantization is a possible way to circumvent these problems , nevertheless , despite the success of gauge field theories in describing the electromagnetic , weak , and strong interactions , the description of gravity at the quantum level is still missing , despite outstanding progress achieved , for instance , in the context of superstring / m - theory .",
    "furthermore , in fundamental theories that attempt to include gravity , new long - range forces often arise in addition to the newtonian inverse - square law .",
    "even if one assumes the validity of the equivalence principle , einstein s theory does not provide the most general way to establish the spacetime metric .",
    "there are also important reasons to consider additional fields , especially scalar fields .",
    "although the latter appear in unification theories , their inclusion predicts a non - einsteinian behaviour of gravitating systems .",
    "these deviations from gr include violations of the equivalence principle , modification of large - scale gravitational phenomena , and variation of the fundamental couplings .    on large scales ,",
    "recent cosmological observations lead one to conclude that our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe based on gr requires that most of the energy content of the universe is in the form of currently unknown dark matter and dark energy components that may permeate much , if not all spacetime .",
    "indeed , recent cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) data indicate that our universe is well described , within the framework of gr , by a nearly flat robertson - walker metric .",
    "moreover , combination of cmbr , supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillation and large scale structure data are consistent with each other only if , in the cosmic budget of energy , dark energy corresponds to about @xmath1 of the critical density , while dark matter to about @xmath2 and baryonic matter to only about @xmath3 .",
    "several models have been suggested to address issues related to these new dark states . for dark energy ,",
    "one usually considers the so - called `` quintessence '' models , which involves the slow - roll down of a scalar field along a smooth potential , thus inducing the observed accelerated expansion ( see @xcite for a review ) . for dark matter , several weak - interacting particles ( wimps )",
    "have been suggested , many arising from extensions to the standard model ( _ e.g. _ axions , neutralinos ) . a scalar field can also account for an unified model of dark energy and dark matter @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can implement this unification through an exotic equation of state , such as the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "however , recently a different approach has attracted some attention , namely the one where one considers a generalization of the action functional .",
    "the most straight forward approach consists in replacing the linear scalar curvature term in the einstein - hilbert action by a function of the scalar curvature , @xmath0 . in this context",
    ", a renaissance of @xmath0 modified theories of gravity has recently been verified in an attempt to explain the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "one could alternatively , resort to other scalar invariants of the theory and necessarily analyze the observational signatures and the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) metric coefficients arising from these extensions of gr . in the context of dark matter",
    ", the possibility that the galactic dynamics of massive test particles may be understood without the need for dark matter was also considered in the framework of @xmath0 gravity models @xcite . despite the extensive literature on these @xmath0 models ,",
    "an interesting possibility has passed unnoticed till quite recently .",
    "it includes not only a non - minimal scalar curvature term in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian density , but also a non - minimal coupling between the scalar curvature and the matter lagrangian density @xcite ( see also ref .",

    "it is interesting to note that nonlinear couplings of matter with gravity were analyzed in the context of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , and in the study of the cosmological constant problem @xcite . in this contribution",

    "the scalar - tensor representation of the model is presented , with particular emphasis on the new features and difficulties encountered in the new model .",
    "these issues are quite relevant , as they allow one to properly obtain the ppn parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 and show that they are consistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "section v , addresses the compatibility of the model with the astrophysical condition for stellar equilibrium @xcite . in section",
    "vi , a further generalization of the model is discussed and an upper bound on the extra acceleration introduced by the new non - minimal coupling is obtained @xcite .",
    "finally , in section vi our conclusions are presented and objectives for further research are discussed .    throughout this work , the convention @xmath6 and the metric signature @xmath7 are used .",

    "the above discussion confirms that if one adopts a particular on - shell lagrangian density as a suitable functional for describing a perfect fluid , then this leads to the issue of distinguishing between different predictions for the extra force .",

    "therefore , the equivalence between different on - shell lagrangian densities @xmath79 and the original quantity @xmath12 is broken , so that one can no longer freely choose between the available forms . for the same reason , the additional extra force is unique , and obtained by replacing @xmath80 into eq .",
