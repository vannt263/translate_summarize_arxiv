    "the stellar populations of galaxies offer a unique view of the formation and evolution of galaxies . in this work ,",
    "we use stellar populations to explore the evolution of barred quiescent disk galaxies .",
    "bars are predicted to affect the properties of their host galaxies through the slow rearrangement of energy and mass , a process called secular evolution @xcite .",
    "this redistribution of material leads to many effects , including the flattening of the initial global abundance gradients of their host galaxies @xcite , which results in bulge abundances that are dependent on the presence of star formation . specifically ,",
    "if star formation is present , then the gaseous metallicities of bulges in barred galaxies are predicted to increase compared to unbarred galaxies @xcite , while the bulge stellar metallicities stay relatively unchanged @xcite . in this case , bars are also predicted to produce younger stellar populations at the center and the ends of the bar structure @xcite .",
    "but if star formation is absent , then both the gaseous and stellar metallicities of bulges in barred galaxies are predicted to decrease due to dilution by lower metallicity stars and gas from further galactocentric distances , assuming an initial negative metallicity gradient @xcite .",
    "so far , works that have studied the _ bulge gas - phase metallicities _ of barred galaxies have only considered star - forming galaxies , which means that the bulge gaseous metallicities of barred galaxies are expected to be enhanced relative to unbarred galaxies . while there are works that agree with this prediction , there are others that do not . for example",
    ", @xcite , who used a large sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , found that the gas - phase metallicities in the inner few kpc of barred galaxies are higher ( by @xmath60.06 dex ) than unbarred galaxies at a given stellar mass . but",
    "@xcite , who also used a large sample of sdss galaxies , found that for a given stellar mass there are no significant differences in the gas - phase metallicities at the inner few kpc of barred and unbarred galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , in contrast to all these results , @xcite and @xcite found that the central gas - phase metallicities of barred galaxies are lower than that of unbarred galaxies .",
    "works that have studied the _ bulge stellar populations _ of barred galaxies have considered both star - forming and quiescent galaxies . however , in analyzing their results , most of these works did not separate star - forming galaxies from quiescent galaxies , thus producing results that are difficult to interpret .",
    "nonetheless , we summarize their findings for the benefit of the reader : @xcite found that barred galaxies have higher bulge stellar metallicities than unbarred galaxies at a given velocity dispersion , which is consistent with the findings of @xcite , who additionally found that the bulges of a sample of barred s0 galaxies are slightly @xmath7-enhanced compared to that of unbarred s0 galaxies . these results , however , are in contrast to those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; they all found no difference in the stellar metallicity of bulges .",
    "moreover , there is a similar disagreement about the bulge stellar ages of barred and unbarred galaxies : @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite found no difference , while @xcite did .",
    "clearly , there is no consensus on whether bars affect the bulge abundances of their host galaxies .",
    "however , the lack of any strong bulge abundance differences in these works suggests that any potential effects from bars are probably small .",
    "turning to global gradients , which are predicted to be flatter in barred galaxies regardless of the presence of star formation , reveals a similarly confused landscape . while some studies found that the _ gas - phase metallicity gradients _ of barred galaxies are flatter than unbarred galaxies @xcite , other studies found no difference @xcite .",
    "studies on the _ stellar population gradients _ of barred galaxies have also found conflicting results . using slits",
    "placed along the bars of 20 galaxies , @xcite found a variety of stellar metallicity and age gradients , including positive , negative , and null gradients ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . for two of these galaxies",
    ", @xcite found that the stellar metallicity and age gradients are flatter along the bar than along the disk . in agreement , @xcite used a sample of 28 galaxies to show that the stellar metallicity gradients of boxy / peanut - shaped bulges ( which are presumably , indicative of the presence of a bar ; @xcite ) are shallower than that of a sample of unbarred early - type galaxies . but most recently , using 62 face - on spiral galaxies from the califa survey @xcite , @xcite found no difference in the stellar metallicity gradient or age gradient ( their gradients extend out to the disk region ) between barred and unbarred galaxies .    similar to bulge abundances , there is no consensus on whether bars affect the abundance gradients of their host galaxies , indicating that any potential effects due to bars are small .",
    "therefore highly accurate and precise chemical analysis is needed to robustly detect them .",
    "this work aims to achieve this goal by using very high signal - to - noise ( s / n @xmath8 @xmath1 ) stacks of barred and unbarred galaxies , identified by galaxy zoo 2 @xcite , to model their stellar populations . aside from the unprecedented",
    "s / n stacks of barred galaxies , an additional important and unique feature of our study is the minimization of emission lines by selecting only quiescent galaxies .",
    "this latter feature circumvents the need to model the emission line contribution , which is complex and introduces more uncertainty to the resulting stellar population parameters @xcite . moreover , with quiescent galaxies",
    ", we are comparing to predictions that have not been investigated , i.e. , simulations without star formation .",
    "we describe the data , sample selection , stacking , and stellar population synthesis model in  2 and  3 .",
    " 4 presents our results , which indicates that there are no significant differences in the stellar populations of barred and unbarred quiescent disk galaxies .",
    "we present a comparison to past works in  5 and discuss our results in  6 .",

    ", we assume a flat cosmological model with @xmath9 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , and all magnitudes are given in the ab magnitude system .",
    "since our study aims to model the stellar populations of barred and unbarred quiescent disk galaxies , we must procure spectra of a large sample of these types of galaxies .",
    "thus we use the spectroscopic main galaxy sample in the legacy area of the sdss data release seven ( sdss dr7 ; @xcite ) ; these spectra are measured with a 3@xmath12 fiber , hence the results presented in this work only concern the central regions of our galaxies .      in order to most accurately and most precisely model the detailed abundance patterns of galaxies , passive galaxies with little - to - no emission lines are required .",
    "thus we select quiescent galaxies as described by @xcite , i.e. , no h@xmath7 or [ o@xmath13ii]@xmath143727 emission ; these criteria have been shown to exclude star - forming galaxies and agn hosts @xcite .",
    "compared to a red sequence defined by specific star formation rate or rest - frame @xmath15 , this spectroscopic quiescent criteria is much more strict  about @xmath16 of the galaxies in the red sequence make it into our quiescent sample .",
    "however , the fraction of face - on disk galaxies and the fraction of barred galaxies , which are defined below , are similar in both the red sequence and our spectroscopically - defined quiescent sample , indicating that our sample selection is not picking a special subset of red sequence galaxies .",
    "the presence of quiescent disks is consistent with recent work that showed that galaxies with disks have made up a significant fraction of the red sequence since @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "in addition to our quiescent selection , we follow the sdss dr7 caveats and select galaxies with median s / n>10 @xmath1 and with velocity dispersions of @xmath18 . for these selections",
    ", we have utilized the mpa - jhu dr7 value - added catalogs .",
    "to select barred disk galaxies from our quiescent sample , we first select face - on disk galaxies based on the criteria of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "namely , we select galaxies with axis ratios ( @xmath19 ) larger than 0.5 since it is difficult to identify bars in edge - on galaxies ( @xmath19 measurements are from the gim2d single srsic fits by @xcite ) .",
    "we then use the debiased ; see @xcite for more details ) . ]",
    "galaxy zoo 2 ( gz2 ) visual morphological classifications from @xcite to select non - edge - on disk galaxies by requiring that for each galaxy , at least a quarter of its classifications involved answering the bar question .",
    "a relevant aside is to compare our quiescent disk sample to the red spiral sample of @xcite : we find that less than @xmath20 of their sample make it into our sample .",
    "the main reason is our requirement of little - to - no h@xmath7 or [ o@xmath13ii]@xmath143727 emission , which is apparently present in almost all red spiral galaxies ( @xcite also excluded large bulges and imposed a more strict inclination cut ) .",
    "this comparison indicates that the disks of this sample of galaxies are distinctive in that they have little to no detectable spiral structure , i.e. , they are featureless disks .    from this face - on quiescent disk sample ,",
    "we select barred galaxies with a debiased bar vote fraction threshold of 0.5 , i.e. , galaxies with @xmath21 are considered barred . this bar threshold has been shown to be a reliable indicator of strong bar features  almost all galaxies with @xmath22 were classified as possessing a strong bar by @xcite ( see @xcite and @xcite)and has been adopted by several past galaxy zoo works @xcite",
    ". using a more strict debiased bar vote fraction threshold of @xmath23 does not change our qualitative results .",
    "we present representative images of barred galaxies in a given stellar mass and redshift interval in fig .",

    "this bar vote fraction choice is different from previous galaxy zoo works because we want to minimize contamination from weak bars , which has been shown by @xcite and @xcite to likely have @xmath25 .",
    "the selection of face - on unbarred quiescent disks is difficult and there is no perfect technique .",
    "however , comparing the structural parameters ( global srsic index , central surface stellar mass density , central velocity dispersion , and bulge - to - total ratio ) of our barred and unbarred quiescent disk samples for a given stellar mass bin shows a similar distribution , indicating that we select similar types of galaxies ( see figs .",

    "while some of these differences can be attributed to the choice of stellar population synthesis model , @xcite have shown that there is a broad agreement between their model ( the one used in this work ) and several other popular models , including ez_ages @xcite , which uses lick indices as opposed to full - spectrum fitting . thus assuming that different models produce similar results , we will restrict our comparison to data quantity , data quality , and sample selection .",
    "comparing our data quantity to previous works shows that there are only a couple of works that are comparable@xcite have 251 barred galaxies and 324 unbarred galaxies , and @xcite have 414 barred galaxies and 1180 unbarred galaxies ; both works primarily contained star - forming barred galaxies .",
    "our work contains over a 1,000 quiescent barred galaxies and over 5,000 quiescent unbarred galaxies .",
    "comparing our data quality to previous works shows that our stacked spectra have the highest s / n ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) .",
    "previous works have spectra with s / n=10 - 50 @xmath1 , which produces less accurate and less precise stellar population parameters .",
    "of course , in order to achieve such high s / n , we have stacked many spectra , which has not been done in any previous work on this topic .",
    "thus our work is measuring the average effects of bars in quiescent disk galaxies .    finally , comparing",
    "our sample selection to previous works shows that our sample is unique . while we only select galaxies with sdss spectra that are bereft of two of the strongest optical emission lines",
    " h@xmath7 and [ o@xmath13ii]@xmath143727all previous works selected galaxies with a range of star formation states .",
    "in fact , most works require the presence of these lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the main benefit of our selection criteria is that our stacked spectra have minimal emission line contamination , resulting in highly accurate and precise stellar population modeling , which was one of the main goals of this work .",
    "this sample selection , however , is an important consideration in our interpretation , which we discuss in  [ sec : discussion ] ( see also [ sub : sample_selection ] ) .",
    "based on these three comparisons , it is clear that our work is unlike any of the previous works on this topic .",
    "interestingly though , even with our differences , we find similar results to the latest work on this topic .",
    "namely , like @xcite , we find no strong differences in the stellar populations of barred and unbarred galaxies , indicating that bars do not significantly affect the stellar populations of their host galaxies , regardless of their star formation state .",
    "the results presented in this work indicate that bars do not affect  at least not strongly enough for us to significantly detect  the central stellar populations of quiescent disk galaxies . in the following discussion , we assume that bars are long - lived structures , which is consistent with the latest simulations of bar formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "moreover , given that our sample comprises solely of quiescent galaxies , we will restrict our comparison to simulations without star formation . according to these types of simulations from @xcite ,",
    "barred galaxies should have a lower central stellar [ fe / h ] ( by about @xmath74 dex ) compared to unbarred galaxies because the bar - driven inward transportation of stars reduces the initial negative [ fe / h ] gradient ( see also @xcite , who find a reduction of about @xmath75 dex in the central [ fe / h ] of barred galaxies , albeit with unrealistic initial conditions ) .",
    "but as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stellarpop_vs_mass ] , the bulge [ fe / h ] of barred galaxies do not differ from that of unbarred galaxies at the few hundredths of a dex level .",
    "chemical simulations of bar - driven secular evolution without star formation also predict that the slopes of the [ fe / h ] gradients of barred galaxies are flatter than those of unbarred galaxies @xcite .",
    "but fig .",
    "[ fig : gradients ] shows no obvious differences in the [ fe / h ] slopes of barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "it is important to note , however , that our gradients do not extend beyond the bar , and are in fact , well within the bars of our sample .",
    "this is important because most simulations have shown that the flattening of abundance gradients is most dramatic in the outskirts of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , simulations predict that the [ fe / h ] gradients near the centers are still affected by the presence of a bar@xcite predicts a flattening by @xmath60.01 dex / kpc in the inner regions of their barred galaxy simulation  an effect that we do not observe , albeit this effect may be too subtle for us to detect .",
    "the above mentioned simulations , however , do not include the effects of initial star formation and feedback , which are necessary for the accurate calculation of metallicity gradients .",
    "additionally , quiescent galaxies are not produced in any simulations , i.e. , galaxies are either always star - forming or always quiescent in simulations .",
    "moreover , since the onset of bars is around z @xmath76 ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and assuming that bars are long - lived ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the simulations should use initial conditions based on what we know for galaxies of that era .",
    "no observational data are available for metallicity gradients at such redshifts , apart from the work of @xcite , which indicates that some of the gas - phase metallicity gradients of galaxies around z @xmath77 could be positive even though most of them are negative .",
    "furthermore , there are no corresponding measurements for the stellar metallicity gradients .",
    "finally , these simulations mentioned above assume small bulges , which may optimize the tangential force from bars @xcite .",
    "thus the predictions from these simulations may be overestimating the influence of bars . in view of this situation ,",
    "it does not seem possible to compare adequately theoretical predictions with our results concerning the differential effect between barred and unbarred quiescent galaxies at z @xmath78 .",
    "in this work , we use the latest stellar population synthesis model of @xcite to estimate the stellar populations of barred and unbarred quiescent disk galaxies with very high s / n ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) stacks drawn from the sloan digital sky survey . taking advantage of the variable physical size of the sdss fiber as a function of redshift",
    ", we model the stellar populations at different parts within galaxies .",
    "we first focus on the bulges of galaxies , which have a typical half - light radius of 1 kpc @xcite , and approximates the physical size of the sdss fiber at @xmath2 .",
    "we then estimate the stellar population gradients by assuming that galaxies at a fixed stellar mass do not significantly evolve in the redshift range of @xmath57 , which spans @xmath48 gyr .",
    "our resulting stellar population gradients extend out to @xmath79% of the median semi - major half - light radius of our samples , which is well within the extent of the bars in our sample .",
    "we find that there are no significant differences in the stellar populations of the bulges or the gradients of barred vs. unbarred quiescent disk galaxies , suggesting that bars are not a significant influence to the chemical evolution of quiescent disk galaxies .",

    "this similarity though , does not mean that our unbarred quiescent disk sample is severely contained by ellipticals .",
    "indeed , the structural distributions of our barred quiescent disk sample are also similar to that of the spheroid - dominated sample at these massive bins . and since bars are pure disk phenomena @xcite , we conclude that the structural parameters we considered simply can not distinguish spheroid - dominated galaxies from quiescent disk galaxies at high stellar masses . therefore , given the ineffectiveness of these structural parameters to distinguish face - on quiescent disks from spheroid - dominated galaxies at high masses , we rely on the visual morphologies of galaxy zoo",
