    "however , the @xmath0 framework offers several advantages : firstly , more general classes of spde may be treated , secondly , contractive properties in @xmath0 norm are sometimes better than those in @xmath24 norm .",

    ", the time variable does not play a special role and is regarded as another space variable and , in particular , space - time fourier transforms are employed in the proofs .",

    "we rely on different arguments : we put forward averaging lemmas that rely on space - time fourier transforms , littlewood - paley decomposition and a careful analysis of each of the appearing terms . as a consequence , we are able to estimate the stochastic integral as well as the kinetic measure term directly by averaging techniques , without any additional damping ( as compared to @xcite ) .",

    "second , the equi - integrability estimates encoded in the decay properties of the kinetic measure in the deterministic situation , that is , in the assumption ( cf .",

    "<S> we study quasilinear degenerate parabolic - hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations with general multiplicative noise within the framework of kinetic solutions . </S>",
    "<S> our results are twofold : first , we establish new regularity results based on averaging techniques . </S>",
    "<S> second , we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions in a full @xmath0 setting requiring no growth assumptions on the nonlinearities . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we prove a comparison result and an @xmath0-contraction property for the solutions . </S>"
