    "kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been discovered by the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) in a number of low mass x - ray binaries ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 , van der klis et al .",
    "the presence of two observed peaks with frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the upper part of the power spectrum became a natural starting point in modeling the phenomena .",
    "attempts have been made to relate @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the peak separation @xmath9 with the neutron star ( ns ) spin . in the beat frequency model ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) the khz peak separation @xmath10",
    "is considered to be close to the ns spin frequency and thus @xmath10 is predicted to be constant . in other words @xmath11 is an `` invariant '' which does not vary when the khz qpos frequencies change .",
    "however observations of khz qpos in a number of binaries ( sco x-1 , 4u 1728 - 34 , 4u 1608 - 52 , 4u 1702 - 429 and etc ) show that the peak separation decreases systematically when khz frequencies increases ( see a review by van der klis 2000 , hereafter vdk ) . for sco x-1 vdk found that the peak separation of khz qpo frequencies changes from 320 hz to 220 hz when the low peak @xmath7 changes from 500 hz to 850 hz .",
    "the lower frequency part of the power spectrum , contains two horizontal branch oscillation ( hbo ) frequencies @xmath12 hz and @xmath13 hz ( presumably the second harmonic of @xmath4 ) which slowly increase with increase of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( van der klis et al .",
    "_ any consistent model faces a challenging task of describing the dependences of the peak separation @xmath11 and hbo frequency @xmath4 on @xmath7 and @xmath8 _ .",
    "there are two other qpo models in the literature which infer the relations between @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "the transition layer model ( tlm ) was introduced by titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov ( 1998 ) , hereafter tlm98 , to explain the dynamical adjustment of a keplerian disk to the innermost sub - keplerian boundary conditions ( e.g. at the ns surface ) .",
    "tlm98 argued that a shock should occur where the keplerian disk adjusts to the sub - keplerian flow .",
    "it was suggested by osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) , hereafter ot99 , that the radial oscillations of the fluid element that bounced from the disk shock region ( presumably at the adjustment radius ) would be seen as two independent oscillations in the radial and the vertical directions due to the presence of a coriolis force in the magnetospheric rotational frame of reference .",
    "simultaneous measurements of the frequencies of the two khz qpos and hbo harmonics in a wide frequency range allow one to derive the angle @xmath0 .",
    "titarchuk & osherovich ( 2001 , hereafter to01 ) , claim that for the sources gx 340 + 0 , sco x-1 , 4u 1702 - 42 and 4u 0614 + 09 the inferred angle @xmath0 , ( see eq 1 in to01 ) stays the same over significant range of the observed qpo frequencies .",
    "the low branch frequency @xmath14 , the kepler frequency @xmath15 and the hybrid frequency @xmath16 , as they are introduced by ot99 are eigenfrequencies of the oscillator . however these frequencies are revealed in the observations as the _ resonance _ frequencies @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 which are broadened as a result of the ( radiative ) damping in the oscillator ( see tlm98 , eq . 15 ) .",
    "furthermore , the resonance frequencies @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are shifted with respect to the eigenfrequencies @xmath14 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 .",
    "the frequency shift and random errors of the eigenfrequencies depend on the damping rate of oscillations @xmath18 ( see details in  2 ) .",
    "one should keep in mind that the systematic and random errors in the centroid frequency determination due to this resonance shift can be a factor of a few larger than the statistical error in the determination of the centroid frequency . in the present data analysis ( as the first approximation )",
    "we assume that @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "the inclination angle between the particle orbit plane and the equatorial plane can be infinitesimal . for a nonrotating configuration of the central body ( in the schwarzchild s treatment )",
    "the angular velocity is calculated using a classical kepler s formula . in the general case , when the intrinsic angular momentum , @xmath22 the azimuthal frequency is expressed in units @xmath23 , @xmath24 as follows ( bardeen et al . , 1972 ; stella et al .",

    "the _ letter _ reports the results of the detailed data analysis from sco x-1 collected by rxte during 4 years of observations from 1996 to 1999 . in  2 , we describe the rxte data which we use to construct the power spectra in the frequency range from @xmath40 hz to @xmath41 hz . in ",
    "2 we also give details of the resonance effect on the eigenfrequency restoration using the observed qpo frequencies and present comparisons of the predictions of the qpo models with the rxte observations . summary and conclusions are drawn in  3 .",

    "we constructed the power density spectra ( pds ) in the frequency range from 0.03125  hz to 2048  hz to analyze the sco  x-1 variability .",
    "the features of the low frequency and high frequency variability were investigated in the range @xmath45 hz and @xmath46 hz respectively .",
    "the pds was fit by a constant ( due to dead time effect , see details in vihlinin et al .",
    "1994 ) and a few lorentzians to determine qpo frequencies and we added the following term @xmath47^{-1},$ ] to our model to approximate low - frequency noise component .          among all analyzed spectra where a khz qpo pair was detected we selected only those for which an hbo was detected as well and at a significance more than 4 @xmath48 .",
    "the second harmonic @xmath49 is present for nearly all of these @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth noting that the significance of the hbo peaks decrease with the frequency which is a well known effect for quite a few sources noted by vdk . because of this",
    ", we can not find hbo harmonics for hbo frequencies higher than 48 hz ( @xmath50 hz ) with reliable level of significance .",
    "ratio @xmath51 , on the average , is slightly below than 2 , namely @xmath52 .",
    "the observational appearance of the hbo harmonics is presumably a combination frequency effect along with a resonance in weakly nonlinear oscillation system ( landau & lifshitz 1965 , hereafter ll ) .",
    "the resonance in weakly nonlinear systems occurs at the eigenfrequencies of the system @xmath53 when the frequency of the driving force @xmath54 is @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 are integers ( ll ) .",
    "the main peak resonance power ( for @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) is the strongest among all the harmonics because the peak power diminishes very quickly with the increase of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( ll ) .",
    "the maximum of the main resonance amplitude for the linear and nonlinear oscillations is not precisely at the eigenfrequency @xmath53 , but rather it is shifted to the frequency @xmath60 . for a linear oscillator",
    "@xmath28 depends on the damping rate @xmath18 ( see ll and and tlm98 , eq . 15 for the power of the forced oscillations ) , i.e. @xmath61 and thus the frequency shift @xmath62 from eq .",
    "( 3 ) it follows that @xmath63 when @xmath64 .",
    "ll also shows that the half - width of the resonance curve @xmath65 for @xmath66 . taking a differential from the left and right hand sides of the formula for @xmath28",
    "one can derive a formula for the random error of the eigenfrequency determination @xmath67 due to the resonance effect : @xmath68 .",
    "now one can estimate the ratio of the systematic shift and random error to @xmath69 .",
    "they are @xmath70 and @xmath71 for frequencies presented by jonker et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in tables  2 and 4 . of the tlm .",
    "they found that @xmath72 and @xmath73 for gx 5 - 1 and gx 17 + 2 respectively .",
    "but they pointed out the very large @xmath74 and @xmath75 for gx 5 - 1 and gx 17 + 2 respectively .",
    "their @xmath76 calculations include the statistical error only but do not account for the systematic resonance shift @xmath77 and for the random resonance error @xmath78 . ]",
    "we can conclude that jonker s et al .",
    "@xmath76 for the @xmath2mean would be significantly reduced if this effect were taken into account .    in the nonlinear case",
    "the systematic and random shifts are also affected by the amplitude of the driving force and the relative weights ( coefficients ) of the nonlinear terms ( ll ) .",
    "it is not by chance that our observed values of @xmath79 differ from 2 , _ since the apparent observed resonance frequency @xmath4 is shifted with respect to the eigenfrequency @xmath53_. this realization is particularly important when one compares the observationally identified frequencies @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 and those predicted by the qpo models . in order to lessen the uncertainty in determining the real eigenfrequency value as well as to decrease the systematic error caused by this nonlinear effect , we use two values for the low - frequency identification : @xmath4 and @xmath80 .",
    "the second value is a mean of @xmath53 , calculated using the main resonance frequency @xmath4 and the second harmonic frequency @xmath49 .",
    "the average pds and the main frequencies @xmath4 ( and also @xmath81 ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 were used for the analysis of the tlm and rpm .          for each set of @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 we obtained the @xmath2value using formula ( 1 ) in to01 , where @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are identified with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "in figure  1 the dependence of the angle @xmath0 between a normal to the disk and a magnetospheric axis on @xmath4 is shown .",
    "we establish that the strongest dependence of @xmath0 on the qpo peak frequencies involves @xmath4 .",
    "thus we investigated this dependence only .",
    "the model invariants should be kept the same , independent of the qpo frequency branch where it is verified . in table  1",
    "the approximation of @xmath0 by constant are present for two cases : @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "1 the lower panel ) and @xmath82 ( in the latter case the second harmonic is taken into account for @xmath0 determination ) .",
    "for each case we provide a reduced @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath2rms and the standard deviations @xmath84 are also present in table  1 .",
    "we repeated the same procedure for @xmath0 vs @xmath14 when @xmath85 . in figure  1",
    "these results are present . in order to reduce the possible stochastic scattering in the data , which always dominates relative to the statistical scattering",
    ", we implement an averaging of @xmath0 for a given hbo frequency ( see the upper panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "we repeated the same procedure for @xmath0 vs @xmath14 when @xmath85 . in figure  2",
    "these results are present . whereas some correlation of @xmath0 vs @xmath4 are clearly seen in figure  1 ,",
    "points @xmath86 are almost scattered along the horizontal line in figure  2 ( see the upper panel ) .",
    "now we investigate the rpm invariant , the ns mass @xmath1 as a function of @xmath87 or as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "the deduced dependences of @xmath1 on the hbo frequencies are stronger than for the khz frequencies ( similar to the case with @xmath0 for the tlm ) . in table  2 and in figs .",
    "34 we present a mean value of @xmath1 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath89 values are a factor of 3 - 6 bigger than that in table  1 for @xmath0 .",
    "but the relative deviation of @xmath1 , @xmath91 is also 2% as @xmath84 for @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath1 drops from 2.8 @xmath92 to 2.6 @xmath92 with increase of @xmath81 from 39.5 hz to 46.5 hz and the statistical deviation converge to the real values of the mean and the standard deviation with increase of a number of points for a given hbo frequency . ] . in rpm",
    "the mean @xmath1 are scattered along the oblique line whereas in the tlm @xmath0 are scattered along the horizontal line .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table  2 it is seen that the rpm is inconsistent with data ( @xmath93 , _ there is a perfect linear correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath81 ) and the proposed parameter @xmath1 is not invariant with respect to the observed qpo frequencies_. it is worth noting that inclusion of the second hbo component into the determination of the hbo peak leads to a weakening of the correlation for @xmath0 vs hbo frequencies while the opposite effect is seen for the correlation between @xmath1 vs hbo frequencies . in figs .  2 ,  4",
    "it is shown that the averaging leads to a decrease in the scattering of the inferred parameters along the best - fit line .",

    "it should be pointed out that @xmath89 in the table  1 are affected by the aforementioned underestimation of the systematic and random resonance shift ( see introduction and  2.2 ) .",
