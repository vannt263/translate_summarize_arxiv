    "left - right ( lr ) models have long provided attractive extensions to the well - tested standard model ( sm ) of particle physics  @xcite .",
    "a typical lr model is constructed by enlarging the sm gauge group @xmath2 to the group @xmath0 and thus contains an extra set of @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge bosons compared to the standard model , as well as an extended higgs structure .",
    "minimal versions of the left - right model usually contain one bidoublet higgs boson , @xmath5 , as well as left- and right - handed triplet higgs bosons , @xmath6 , although other constructions are also possible ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there are several reasons for the appeal of lr models . among these",
    "is the fact that , unlike in the sm , the @xmath1 symmetry of the theory has a physical interpretation in terms of baryon and lepton number .",
    "also , the observed parity - odd nature of the low - energy weak interactions is seen to be the result of a spontaneously broken symmetry in the lr model .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that , since parity is an exact symmetry of the theory at high energies , the strong cp problem has a natural solution in the context of lr models  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the choice of a higgs triplet to break left - right symmetry at a high energy scale leads naturally to a seesaw relation to explain the smallness of neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "finally , the extended higgs sector of the theory gives the possibility , at least in principle , of breaking cp spontaneously .",
    "many authors have focused on the possibility of spontaneous cp violation in lr models , both in minimal versions as well as in extended versions containing more complicated higgs sectors  @xcite .",
    "the results in minimal versions of the lr model have by and large been somewhat negative regarding the possibility of generating spontaneous cp violation , while investigations of more complicated models have had more encouraging results . a further complication in the case of the minimal model concerns the presence of neutral higgs bosons having flavour - violating couplings to quarks ( flavour changing neutral higgs ( fcnh ) bosons ) .",
    "recently , barenboim et al studied the decoupling limit of the minimal cp - invariant higgs potential in the lr model  @xcite .",
    "they found that non - negligible cp violation in the vacuum state is generally accompanied by weak - scale non - standard higgs bosons , which are ruled out phenomenologically . for cp - conserving vacuum states they found that it was possible to produce an acceptable physical higgs spectrum , but only at the cost of extreme fine - tuning .",
    "another well - known complication in the higgs sector of lr models concerns the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral component of the left - handed higgs triplet , @xmath7 .",
    "assuming that all dimensionless coefficients in the higgs potential are of order unity , @xmath8 is related to its right - handed counterpart @xmath9 through a seesaw relation , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a dimensionful quantity of order of the weak scale .",
    "the complication resides in the fact that , in general , the left - handed neutrino mass matrix contains a term that is proportional to @xmath8 . barring extreme fine - tunings , this term in the mass matrix forces @xmath8 to be of order a few ev or less , thereby forcing the right - handed scale , @xmath9 , to be extremely large . to allow for the possibility of an observable right - handed scale ,",
    "many authors assume that @xmath12 , a scenario that can be arranged by disallowing certain terms from the higgs potential .",
    "the offending terms in the higgs potential have the form @xmath13 and may be forbidden , for example , by imposing a symmetry under the discrete operation @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "unfortunately , invariance under this symmetry also disallows the majorana yukawa couplings that give rise to the seesaw relation for neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "another approach is simply to assume that the theory is embedded in a grand unified scheme that somehow disallows the troublesome terms from the higgs potential but still allows the desired majorana yukawa terms .",
    "this of course does not solve this problem within the lr model framework .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the higgs sector of the minimal lr model in the case that cp is _ not _ a manifest symmetry of the unbroken theory , a scenario that has not received much attention . in the most general case , the introduction of explicit cp violation corresponds to the introduction of only one complex coefficient into the higgs potential , i.e. only one extra degree of freedom . as we shall see below",
    ", the phase associated with this complex coefficient significantly alters the dynamics of the higgs sector , and we find that the presence of cp violation in the vacuum state no longer precludes the existence of an acceptable higgs spectrum .    in our calculation , in order to suppress @xmath8 to phenomenologically acceptable levels , we further assume the presence of an extra horizontal symmetry that is broken by a small parameter @xmath16  @xcite . an appropriate choice of charge assignments under this symmetry suppresses certain coefficients in the higgs potential and brings @xmath8 down to the ev scale for moderately light right - handed scales ( @xmath17  tev , say ) .",
    "the model still does contain a certain amount of fine - tuning .",
    "in particular , one dimensionless coefficient in the higgs potential needs to be `` unnaturally '' small ( of order @xmath18 ) .",
    "since we restrict our attention to right - handed scales that are only `` moderately '' large , this fine - tuning is not as unnatural as it might be in general .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the model and perform the minimization of the higgs potential to obtain relations among the various higgs vevs .",
    "section  [ sec : mass_matrices ] contains several approximate expressions for the higgs boson masses .",
    "section  [ sec : numerical ] contains our numerical results and in sec .  [ sec : conclusions ] we offer some concluding remarks .",
    "the appendix describes the derivations of the approximate expressions for the higgs boson masses .",
    "we consider a lr model with a single bidoublet field @xmath19 and triplet fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 . under @xmath22 the fermion fields in the theory transform as @xmath23 and the higgs fields transform as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "<S> we explore the higgs sector of the minimal left - right ( lr ) model based on the gauge group @xmath0 with explicit cp violation in the higgs potential . since flavour - changing neutral current experiments and the small scale of neutrino masses both place stringent constraints on the higgs potential , we seek to determine whether minima of the higgs potential exist that are consistent with current experimental bounds . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the case in which the right - handed symmetry - breaking scale is only `` moderately '' large , of order 15 - 50 tev . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the case in which the higgs potential is cp - invariant , the cp noninvariant case does yield viable scenarios , although these require a small amount of fine - tuning . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a lr model supplemented by an additional @xmath1 horizontal symmetry , which results in a higgs sector consistent with current experimental constraints and a realistic spectrum of neutrino masses . </S>"
