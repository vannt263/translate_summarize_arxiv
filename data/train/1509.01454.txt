    "one of the unresolved problems in cloud physics is drizzle formation in a warm ( ice free ) clouds .",
    "early modelling studies using lagrangian parcel models @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) demonstrated that condensational growth leads to a very narrow droplet spectrum , contrary to the observations , where the droplet spectrum inside the cloud was relatively broad e.g. @xcite  ( @xcite ) .",
    "a narrow droplet spectrum makes collision between droplets inefficient and as a result it takes a long time to switch from a condensational to a coagulational droplet growths .",
    "observations show , that development of precipitation in the clouds may be rapid e.g. @xcite  ( @xcite ) which could nt be explained by the modelling results .",
    "several mechanisms to explain this discrepancy between numerical model and observations were proposed and were reviewed by @xcite  ( @xcite ) .",
    "undoubtedly representation of the cloud formation process by a parcel model is an approximation .",
    "nevertheless attempts were made over the time to explain the width of the cloud droplet spectrum in clouds using this approach .",
    "@xcite  ( @xcite ) showed that a much broader droplet spectrum can be obtained when instead of one vertical velocity , a velocity distribution is used .",
    "another approach was utilized by @xcite  ( @xcite ) and @xcite  ( @xcite ) , who used a velocity field from a bulk model to derive trajectories for the parcel models .",
    "for both these approaches droplet spectra broader than predicted by a single parcel were reported , however , in these approaches the microphysics is separated from dynamics and thermodynamics of the eulerian model .",
    "the use of the bin models @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , where droplet spectrum is represented as a continuous function , made the problem of the transition from condensational to coagulational disappear .",
    "even very high resolution ( in bin sizes ) parcel models with bin microphysics are capable of producing precipitation @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) independent of whether turbulent enhancement is or is not taken into account .",
    "it s not clear , however , whether the rain forms in these models due to physical processes or numerical errors associated with the numerical solution of the condensational growth and collision or the physics itself , since detailed comparisons between eulerian ( bin ) and lagrangian models were never to our knowledge reported .    in the recent years",
    "a new approach to microphysics formulated in lagrangian framework was proposed for both warm rain @xcite  ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) and ice clouds @xcite  ( @xcite ) . in this",
    "approach dynamics and thermodynamics are represented in the traditional eulerian framework , whilst microphysics is represented in a lagrangian framework with two way interactions between eulerian and lagrangian parts .",

    "resulting forces , together with a drag force are return to the eulerian model .",
    "transport of physical properties by lagrangian parcels overcomes many problems present in eulerian models .",
    "the lagrangian representation of microphysics is diffusion free ; each parcel can be treated individually , which makes representation of the sub - grid scale variability easier ; the edge of the cloud is resolved without the need of the use of a special techniques ( for instance vof discussed in @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) ) . at the same time representation of the field with a limited number of parcels",

    "turbulence can affect directly relative velocities of the colliding droplets , leading to a coalescence of droplets which would not collide in a laminar flow .",
    "it can also indirectly influence drizzle formation , by modification of the environment in which droplets grow / evaporate .",
    "a broad review of the effect of turbulence on clouds and its importance were discussed by : @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) and @xcite  ( @xcite ) .",

    "because in the lagrangian microphysics the parcel velocity is a predicted variable , it can be used with the parameterization of the sub - grid scale velocity fluctuations to determine the relative velocity of the colliding parcels .",
    "this article reports an application of a two possible representations ( parameterizations ) of turbulence for a model with microphysics formulated in a lagrangian framework , one - random walk model , and the other interpolation of the velocity to parcel location and investigates its effect on a droplet spectrum .",
    "the results from these models are compared with the results from the model where parcel terminal velocity is used when calculating probability of droplet collisions .",
    "when for a parcel predicted by the model velocity is used to calculate probability of droplet collisions it is assumed that droplet turbulent transport and interaction occur in the same scales , because the same velocity is used for both .",
    "assumption that colliding droplets have terminal velocity corresponds to the case , where turbulent transport and interaction ( collision - coalescence ) between droplets happen in a different scales .",
    "this gives a lower and an upper limit of the effect of the turbulence on droplet collisions , because in former case it is consistent with the turbulent transport model and in latter is neglected .",

    "[ eq1 ] was used .",
    "although the mixing length of the order of model grid size is typically used in sub - grid scale model , in the lagrangian model because the location of each parcel within the grid is known , the mixing length based on @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be derived .",
    "this , simplified , description of the turbulence treats turbulence as a random walk process and represents the effect of air turbulent velocity on lagrangian parcels velocity through the variability in the eulerian model velocity field within a computational grid .",
    "a broad review of theory and application of lagrangian transport models can be found in @xcite  ( @xcite ) .",
    "no attempt has been made to represent eddies present in the turbulent flow , but not resolved by the model ; it is assumed that at each time - step turbulent fluctuations of the air velocity are independent .",
    "it is achieved by generating a new random number for each lagrangian parcel on each time - step .",
    "this method follows an approach proposed by @xcite  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other method of representing variability of the velocity within the computational grid is to use interpolation ; and instead of using the same value of the velocity for all parcels within a given computational grid the velocity can be interpolated from neighboring grids to each parcel location .",
    "these two approaches , later referenced as a turbulence , provide a way to describe the variability of the air turbulent velocity inside computational grids in the spirit discussed by @xcite  ( @xcite ) for a microscopic supersaturation .    details of representation of the coalescence process in lagrangian microphysics is described in detail in @xcite  ( @xcite ) and @xcite  ( @xcite ) .",

    "for each microphysical grid the mass of the aerosol , the mass of the water and the number of new droplets is calculated .",
    "based on this information new parcels are created for each microphysical grid for which the number of physical droplets is larger than specified threshold level - 156.25 in simulations discussed in this article ( which corresponds to resolving 1 droplet / m@xmath28 ) .",

    "they are randomly placed within the eulerian computational grid .",
    "additionally the algorithm assures also that existing parcels represent a larger than threshold level number of physical particles .",
    "should the collision lead to a smaller number , the probability of collision , with all other parcels for this particular one is reduced .",
    "this representation of coalescence process allows to process not only droplet sizes , but also aerosol sizes during droplet coalescence .",

    "the decrease in a twp for a @xmath65 case can be associated with a random velocity of the air within the grid . as a result evaporation at the edge of the cloud",

    "much more time is needed for the coalescence to process aerosol and form large / giant aerosol than the length of an idealized simulation discussed in this article .",
    "there is , however , evidence that this aerosol processing ( eg .",
    "@xcite  ( @xcite ) ) may be an important source of large aerosol , because within the @xmath020 minutes maximum aerosol size has doubled , reaching 2.5 @xmath1 radius ( see fig . [",

    "the increase of the concentration of the large aerosol is at the expense of the aerosol having sizes between 0.01 and 0.2 @xmath1 .",

    "turbulent velocity would have to be significantly larger than terminal velocity of larger droplets to influence @xmath89 , which is not a case in the simulations discussed in this article .",
    "the large values of the enhancement of the gravitational collision efficiency for small droplets are assiciated with the fact that those droplets adjust quickly to the environmental flow , and as a result the velocity of small droplets is very similar to the velocity of the air .",
    "much smaller values of the enhancement of the gravitational collision efficiency for large droplets are because these droplets need more time to adjust to the environmental flow and their terminal velocity is of the same order as air velocity fluctuations .",

    "is observed , and tails for a @xmath90 distribution is much broader than for a @xmath21 , with the statistics for @xmath65 case laying in - between @xmath21 and @xmath90 for a @xmath61 .",
    "in this article two possible representation of the air turbulent velocity in a numerical model with a lagrangian representation of microphysics are discussed . air turbulent velocity in the model",
    "is represented either as a random walk process , with the standard deviation of velocity fluctuations derived from the diffusion coefficient predicted by the numerical model ( eulerian part ) or as an interpolation of an air velocity to a parcel location .",
    "the random walk model is derived for an anelastic approximation and it s shown that an additional , deterministic , term @xmath91 needs to be included in a random walk model for consistency with the eulerian model .",
    "it is argued that the mixing length used in a lagrangian model should be smaller than used to derived diffusion coefficient for an eulerian model ; and the mixing length scale based on tke and model time - step for use in lagrangian microphysics is introduced .",
    "it is demonstrated that interpolation of the velocity to parcel location and use of this velocity in a collision kernel has a similar effect to representation of the turbulence as a random walk , and can be treated as an alternative to a random walk model .",
    "additionally , for turbulence treated as a random walk , because all parcels within the particular computational grid have the same value of the deterministic velocity , fluctuations in the parcel number in a computational grid may be larger than for the case when velocity is interpolated to a parcel location .",
    "unlike the random walk model , interpolation takes into account possible anisotropy in the flow velocity , also observed in a laboratory studies @xcite  ( @xcite ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ) but in a much smaller scale .",
    "if the sub - grid scale transport and droplet collisions occur on the same scale , air turbulent velocity can significantly enhance velocity differences between droplets , especially those having small sizes , when the turbulent velocity is much larger than terminal velocity of these droplets .",
    "in the cases discussed in this article enhancement as large as 120 has been observed for the case when only vertical velocity is taken into account when calculating relative velocity of colliding parcels . allowing for the differences in a horizontal velocity @xmath89 increases by @xmath015 % .",
    "the turbulent enhancement of the velocity of the colliding droplets obtained in this article is much larger than obtained form a dns simulations and used in les model by @xcite  ( @xcite ) or @xcite  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this difference is associated with the fact that in lagrangian microphysics the same velocity is used for the transport and when evaluating collision kernel .",
    "the values obtained with air turbulent velocity fluctuations ( @xmath61 , @xmath65 ) provide an upper limit of the impact of the air velocity fluctuations on gravitational collision efficiency , with the lower limit given by values from the bin simulation .",
    "an additional parameterization is needed to accont for scale separation between transport and droplet interactions .",
    "velocity enhancement diagnosed from the model is non - symmetric , with larger values for sizes smaller than size under consideration .",
    "the asymmetry , however , may be related to the microphysical grid , because in e@xmath92 averaged within a bin parcel velocity difference is normalized by a difference in the terminal velocity for bins these parcels belong to . as a result of the averaging and normalization e@xmath92 also depends on the number of bins used to represent domain in a radius space .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows e@xmath92 for a @xmath61 case together with an additional 2 simulations using the same setup , but one with 55 bins ( p=2@xmath93 ) , and other with 108 bins ( p=2@xmath94 ) . with the increasing number of bins e@xmath92 also increases , reaching the value of 900 when the smallest bin is under consideration .",
    "a e@xmath92 values approach 1 independent on resolution in a radius space when the differences in droplet sizes is large .",
    "turbulent velocity enhancement can affect significantly drizzle formation .",
    "simulation @xmath64 , where droplet vertical velocity has been set to a terminal velocity , based on the bin to which droplets belong produces negligible amount of rain water , and much smaller than for other simulations droplet sizes .",
    "note , however , that even in this case droplets do collide forming larger ones .    for simulations including a representation of air turbulen velocity fluctuations , drizzle forms initially preferentially near the cloud edge ,",
    "near the entrainment eddies or near the cloud top , and often in the areas where q@xmath95 is elevated .",
    "the edge of the cloud is a place where due to entrainment and mixing droplet spectrum is broader than in the center of the cloud and as a result coalescence between droplets is more efficient .",
    "additionally , because of the gradient of the velocity near the cloud edge , the differences in the relative velocity of parcels there is large and this also enhances probability of droplet coalescence .",
    "formation of the first drizzle near the cloud edge it a bin model with the representation of the effect of turbulence on droplet collision rate has been also reported recently by @xcite  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cloud droplet spectrum is relatively broad ( of the order of @xmath96 from the onset of the cloud formation .",
    "this value is much larger than reported for parcel models in the past and large enough to trigger the coalescence process even for the case with a very high cloud droplet concentration .",
    "it s acknowledged , however , that when the standard deviation for each computational grid is considered values smaller than 0.1 @xmath27 m are observed , indicating that very narrow ( comparable to a parcel model ) droplet distributions also form within computational grids .",
    "coalescence does process aerosol , but the time scale of this process is longer than @xmath020 minutes of cloud evolution discussed here .",
    "processing by multiple clouds is needed for the boundary layer aerosol to change the shape of the aerosol distribution .",
    "consider conservation equation for a scalar for an anelastic approximation : @xmath97 where @xmath98 - is concentration , @xmath3 - gas density , @xmath99 - gas velocity , @xmath100 - diffusion coefficient ( note that in general @xmath100 is a tensor , however , here it is assumed that this tensor has only diagonal values not equal to 0 ; k@xmath81=@xmath101 ) .",
    "this equation can be written as : @xmath102+\\triangle(\\rho k c).\\ ] ] this equation corresponds to the following stochastic differential equation in ito sense ( see for instance : @xcite  ( @xcite ) or @xcite  ( @xcite ) for the case when @xmath3 is constant ) : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a wiener process .",
    "integration of this equation gives : @xmath105 or in numerical representation for i - th direction , assuming that @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath3 are constant during the time step : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a random number having normal distribution .",
    "it follows that effectively turbulent diffusion corresponds to a random walk process with mean velocity having two components , first being the velocity from the numerical model , the other accounting for a change in the density and diffusivity in a non - homogeneous medium : @xmath108 and a random component : @xmath109    to find @xmath100 in numerical model an assumption must be made about the mixing length @xmath110 , @xmath111 . typically it is assumed to be of the order of a grid length .",
    "although in the eulerian model this assumption is justified , because mixing within each model grid must be completed within the time - step , in a lagrangian transport model , where the exact location of each parcel is known it s not necessary true . for a lagrangian model",
    "a different length scale can be used , for instance from model time - step and turbulent kinetic energy ( tke ) , which is a prognostic variable in a sub - grid scale model .",
    "the following length scale can be defined : @xmath112=@xmath113 , which for a 2d case discussed in this article is equal to @xmath112=@xmath114 .",
    "it follows that @xmath115 this length scale is used only in a lagrangian model to calculate diffusion coefficient and next the standard deviation of the velocity fluctuations and mean deterministic velocity .",
