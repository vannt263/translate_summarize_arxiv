    "this is defined as a distinct category of non - equilibrium matter in which energy uptake , dissipation and movement take place at the level of discrete microscopic constituents .",

    "recent work by us and others has shown that the pressure is also a state function for an active fluid of spherical spps with purely repulsive interactions  @xcite , but becomes dependent on the nature of the walls as soon as the active particles exert torques on each other or on the boundaries , as would for instance be the case for non - spherical spps  @xcite .    starting with the familiar virial expression  @xcite , the contribution from interparticle interactions to the pressure @xmath69 of a passive fluid with pairwise forces @xmath70",

    "both the divergence of @xmath159 at @xmath160 and the scaling @xmath161 are consistent with the behavior at an equilibrium gas - liquid spinodal line .",

    "in contrast , experiments in bacteria and active colloids generally do not see complete separation in two bulk phases , but rather observe the assembly of finite - size clusters that persist for very long times . in bacterial suspensions birth / death events that eliminate density conservation have been shown to arrest the phase separation yielding the formation of finite - size clusters  @xcite .",
    "attractive interactions have also ben suggested as a possible mechanism for arresting the phase separation  @xcite , but the mechanism that control the size of finite clusters in active colloids remain to be understood .    the @xmath166 divergence of the structure factor as @xmath167 is also the signature of the giant number fluctuations ( gnf ) predicted and observed ubiquitously in the ordered state of flocking models  @xcite .",
    "mips and gnf are , however , two distinct phenomena . in repulsive spps",
    "the large density fluctuations occur in a disordered state and are associated with a critical point and phase separation .",
    "the large density fluctuations that occur in the ordered state of active fluids with both polar and nematic order are the consequence of the coupling of a conserved field - the density - to a non - conserved noisy polarization field .",
    "the @xmath166 behavior of the correlation is in fact a generic feature of systems where the deterministic dynamics of a conserved field couples to non - conserved noise , resulting in power - law decay of correlations  @xcite , and is also ubiquitous in driven granular materials with inelastic interactions  @xcite .",
    "the onset of mips suggests that at moderate density a system of repulsive active colloids behaves like a thermal system with attractive interactions .",
    "this correspondence was recently demonstrated by correlating the pressure measured in sedimentation experiments of active colloids with numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "it has additionally been explored in models of brownian particles with gaussian colored noise correlated over a time @xmath48 , where the colored nature of the noise can be incorporated as an effective interaction in a many - body fokker - planck equation  @xcite . using this approach",
    "it has been shown recently that for weakly persistent motion ( small @xmath48 ) activity can be recast in the form of an effective pair potential with an attractive part of strength that increases with increasing @xmath104  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when the pair interparticle potential actually has an attractive component , activity can yield a weak repulsive contribution to the effective potential , hence competing with attraction by promoting particle escape from the potential well .",
    "in other words , self - propulsion can actually drive a system that has undergone bulk phase separation due to attractive interactions back into a uniform state .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the abp model and the model with gaussian colored noise are characterized by different speed distributions , which is gaussian in the latter , but bounded by @xmath13 in abp and in run - and - tumble models .",
    "simulations have additionally demonstrated that the competition of attraction and activity yields an intermediate regime where complete phase separation is arrested and particles assemble in a gel - like structure that has been seen in simulations in both two and three dimensions  @xcite    finally , it has been shown that hydrodynamic interactions can suppress phase separation by aligning the particles and therefore suppressing the self - trapping responsible for cluster formation  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , strong clustering is often observed in active systems even in the presence of aligning rules  @xcite , indicating that more work needs to be done to understand the effect of aligning torques on the mips of repulsive active particles .",
    "at large packing fraction abp have been shown to freeze in solid states .",
    "while this may not seem surprising since purely repulsive systems are known to form crystalline and glassy states in equilibrium , it is not a priori obvious that such states can survive in the presence of continuous energy input at the microscopic scale .",
    "key to the formation of active solid states is the fact that steric repulsion strongly suppresses motility at high density , as discussed in section [ mips ] .",
    "this results in particle caging and in what was first described by henkes and collaborators as ` active jamming '  @xcite , although that work was for a model of repulsive spps with alignment interactions , where confinement was required to impede collective flocking .    in equilibrium freezing in two dimensions",
    "is a continuous , two - step process , where the system goes from a liquid to a hexatic liquid state with quasi - long range bond orientational order , and then to a crystalline state with long - range orientational order and quasi - long range translational order .",
    "crystallization can be quantified using both structural and dynamical criteria .",
    "the onset of translational order identified via structural probes generally coincides with criteria for dynamical arrest , such as the vanishing of the long - time diffusion coefficient @xmath168 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] .",
    "crystalline order has been seen in phase separating active systems both in experiments and simulations  @xcite . in simulations of monodisperse systems",
    "the dense phase in the phase separated regime exhibits substantial structural order resembling a colloidal crystal near the hexatic - crystal transition , but with unusual super - diffusive behavior  @xcite .",
    "crystalline clusters have also been seen in the experiments , such as the ` living crystals ' formed by light activated colloids engineered by palacci _",
    "et al . _",
    "numerical simulations have also examined the onset of bond - orientational order in abp  @xcite and its correlation with structural arrest , concluding that the onset of order remains continuous , but is shifted to higher density that in equilibrium systems  @xcite . additionally , bialke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported the existence of an intermediate region between the liquid and the solid states characterized by large structural fluctuations .",
    "it is tempting to identify this phase an an active hexatic phase similar to but distinct from the equilibrium hexatic that has been observed for instance in superparamagnetic colloidal particles confined to an air - water interface  @xcite .",
    "finally , in models with aligning interactions the interplay of activity , alignment and structural order can lead to partially ordered liquid crystalline resting and traveling states that are beyond the scope of the present article  @xcite .",
    "our own work has focused on polydisperse systems , where even in equilibrium crystalline order is bypassed in favor of glassy or jammed states .",
    "[ fig : msd](a ) shows a simulation snapshot near the active glass transition for a non - aligning , polydisperse system . in this case",
    "the characterization of glassy behavior relies on criteria for dynamical arrest , such as the strong suppression of diffusion at intermediate times , when particles are persistently caged .",
    "[ fig : msd](b ) shows the evolution of the mean square displacement of a polydisperse assembly of repulsive spps over a range of packing fractions . at small and intermediate packing fraction",
    "the long - time dynamics remains diffusive , but at high packing fraction the msd is bounded over the time of the simulation , indicating a jammed or frozen state . the fluctuations in the actively jammed state ,",
    "see fig .  [",
    "fig : msd](a ) , are intimately connected to the low frequency or ` soft ' modes of a solid that are associated with the jamming transition of passive thermal systems  @xcite . at small @xmath13",
    "active systems form solid phases that can be analyzed in terms of a complete set of normal modes with normal frequencies @xmath169 determined by the inter - particle interactions  @xcite . as in the familiar description of lattice vibrations in terms of phonons ,",
    "the lowest frequencies correspond to large scale collective structural rearrangements of the system .",
    "work on passive granular matter has shown that such low frequency modes have much lower energy barriers than high frequency modes  @xcite .",
    "the jammed state is then a steady state with structural rearrangements involving a handful of low frequency modes that also provide easy paths for unjamming as @xmath13 is increased .",
    "this hints at a generic connection between the dynamics of jammed active systems at low @xmath38 and the kinetic arrest of passive glassy systems , as explored in refs .",
    "note that the prominence of low frequency modes in the active jamming dynamics is strongly linked to the polarization - velocity alignment mechanism , and more work is necessary to disentangle the interplay of activity , alignment and caging .     from our simulations of polydisperse",
    "abp with soft repulsive interactions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ri][eq : thetai ] ) , for @xmath170 showing ballistic growth at small times and the crossover from diffusive to bounded behavior with increasing packing fraction at long time .",
    "the dashed lines have slopes @xmath171 and @xmath172 . ]    one interesting feature of the onset of glassy behavior in repulsive spps is the shift of the glass transition to packing fraction higher than the value @xmath173 obtained for thermal systems in the limit of vanishing motility , @xmath174  @xcite .",
    "this shift increases with increasing persistence time @xmath48 and has been reported in both simulations of spps with hard repulsions where activity pushes the glass transition towards the random close packed limit of @xmath175 and in our simulations of soft disks ( see phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ) , where we find @xmath176 for @xmath177 .",
    "finally , ni _ et al . _ have shown numerically that doping a hard sphere glass with a small number of active particles promotes crystallization bypassing the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a small concentration of active particles may be used as a means for facilitating the formation of large crystalline states that would be otherwise hindered by defects and grain boundaries .",
    "collections of repulsive self - propelled particles , also known as active brownian particles , provide a minimal realization of an active system with rich non - equilibrium behavior .",
    "they exhibit active gas , liquid and solid phases with novel mechanical properties . at low density",
    "they seemingly behave as ` hot ' colloids with an effective temperature controlled by activity ( but see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and a novel swim pressure unique to active systems . at intermediate density",
    "they resemble attractive colloids and exhibit a motility - induced phase separation . at high density",
    "they form solid and glassy phases that have provided new insights in the physics of glassy and jammed solids .",
    "mapping abp s onto an `` equivalent '' equilibrium system has proven a powerful method , as evidenced by the concepts of effective temperature and effective attraction .",
    "such mappings , however , are necessarily limited in scope .",
    "activity - induced attraction is antagonistic to actual attraction  @xcite .",
    "the hot colloid model fails in the presence of a rapidly varying external potential , e.g. , a stiff wall  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the application of these concepts is sometimes subject to controversy and one should keep in mind that active systems are fundamentally nonequilibrium .",
    "the key property that has allowed much theoretical progress in the description of this minimal active system is that the noisy single - particle angular dynamics is decoupled from interactions .",
    "in other words active brownian colloids do not exert torques on each other nor on the walls of a container . as a consequence",
    "the effect of activity can be mapped onto a non - markovian noise of strength controlled by the self - propulsion speed and with time correlation given by the persistence time @xmath48 , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ri - one][eq : xi ] ) .",
    "this has led to renewed interest in stochastic models of brownian particles with gaussian colored noise , for which exact results exist in the literature  @xcite .",
    "although these models are not precisely equivalent to abp due to the different speed distributions , useful insight has been obtained from these studies  @xcite . on the other hand , torques are likely to be present in most experimental realizations , as they can arise from the non - spherical shape of the particles , from lateral friction , from hydrodynamic interactions or explicit aligning rules , and will generally modify the collective behavior of the systems .",
    "it has already been shown , for instance , that the pressure is a state function only for the case of repulsive spherical active brownian particles , independent of the nature of the interaction of the system with the walls .",
    "the presence of torques may also arrest the bulk phase separation , leading instead to clustering or micro - phase separation , as ubiquitously seen in experiments .",
    "work remains to be done to fully understand how alignment , induced either by anisotropic steric effects or by aligning interactions , modifies the phase behavior of active colloids and to make _ quantitative _ contact with experiments .    in the limit of small persistence time ( @xmath178 ) , active brownian colloids are equivalent to brownian colloids .",
    "the opposite limit of @xmath179 is intriguing and has not been fully explored . in this limit",
    "the active drive becomes correlated in time and resembles quenched disorder . at high density",
    "the fluctuations patterns tend to exhibit both spatially and temporally long - ranged correlations  @xcite and resemble those seen in sheared passive granular matter  @xcite , suggesting an intriguing connection that needs to be further investigated .    finally ,",
    "quite unexplored is the effect of noise in the continuum dynamics as described for instance by eqs .",
    "( [ rho ] ) and ( [ p ] ) .",
    "most work using phenomenological continuum models to describe active matter has focused on deterministic equations or has included white gaussian noise in the linear theory to evaluate correlation functions  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the noise in active systems is in general multiplicative in the density  @xcite and may , for instance , provide a mechanisms for selecting nonlinear dynamical states .",
    "the minimal model of active brownian colloids may provide an excellent playground for beginning the exploration of the role of multiplicative noise in mesoscopic theories of active matter .",

    "<S> minimal models of active brownian colloids consisting of self - propelled spherical particles with purely repulsive interactions have recently been identified as excellent quantitative testing grounds for theories of active matter and have been the subject of extensive numerical and analytical investigation . </S>",
    "<S> these systems do not exhibit aligned or flocking states , but do have a rich phase diagram , forming active gases , liquids and solids with novel mechanical properties . </S>",
    "<S> this article reviews recent advances in the understanding of such models , including the description of the active gas and its swim pressure , the motility - induced phase separation and the high - density crystalline and glassy behavior .    </S>",
