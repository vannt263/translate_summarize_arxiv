    "in the standard model of the electro weak interactions , the lepton masses and the values of other parameters such as weak mixing angle , couplings , etc .",
    "are arbitrary and are therefore determined by experiments .",
    "these parameters are independent of each other and can not be determined uniquely , while the neutrino is taken to be massless because of maximal parity violation .",
    "the masslessness of the neutrino however does not follow from any other theoretical ground unlike the local gauge invariance for the photon @xcite .    in order to search for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics ,",
    "light neutrino masses are incorporated in the extensions of the standard model .",
    "empirically , one places finite non - vanishing upper bounds on measurable neutrino masses .",
    "presently , there is some indirect empirical evidence for the masslessness of the neutrino @xcite .",
    "massive neutrinos quite likely mix .",
    "the mixing of quarks is an established fact and because of quark - lepton symmetry , it is natural to assume that leptons exhibit mixing as well .",
    "an additional argument , in this sense , is provided by grand unification models , in which quarks and leptons are described in a unified manner .",
    "mixing means that @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. , the states created in weak interactions , are different from the states @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 that have definite masses .",
    "the neutrinos @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are orthogonal combinations of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with different phases between them .",
    "in addition , the sterile neutrinos may mix with these neutrinos .",
    "neutrino mixing has , as its consequence , neutrino oscillations , i.e. , the process of periodic ( complete or partial ) conversion of neutrinos of one type into another , for instance , @xmath6 .",
    "the components @xmath7 of a mixed neutrino have different masses and hence different phase velocities .",
    "it follows that the phase difference caused by the mass difference between the @xmath7 vary monotonically during the propagation .",
    "this phase change manifests itself as neutrino oscillations .",
    "if neutrino oscillations do occur in vacuum , matter can enhance their depth ( probability amplitude ) up to a maximal value @xcite .",
    "that is , a monotonic change of density may lead to resonant conversions between various neutrino flavors .",
    "this follows from the fact that when neutrinos propagate through a monotonically changing density medium , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) feel different potentials , because @xmath0 scatters off electrons via both neutral and charged currents , whereas @xmath8 scatters off electrons only via the neutral current .",
    "this induces a coherent effect in which maximal conversion of @xmath0 into @xmath1 take place ( even for a rather small intrinsic mixing angle in the vacuum ) , when the phase difference arising from the potential difference between the two neutrinos cancel the phase caused by the mass difference in the vacuum @xcite .    during nearly past half a century ,",
    "the empirical search for neutrinos has spanned roughly six orders of magnitude in neutrino energy @xmath9 , from @xmath10 gev up to @xmath11 gev .",
    "the lower energy edge corresponds to the solar neutrinos , whereas the upper energy edge corresponds to the atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "a detailed early description of the solar neutrino search can be found in @xcite , whereas for recent status , see , for instance @xcite .",
    "the aspects of neutrino production in atmosphere of earth related to neutrino oscillation studies are recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the intermediate energy range corresponds to terrestrial neutrinos such as from reactors ( and accelerators ) and the supernova neutrinos .",
    "thus , obviously either going in energy range below these values or above are the available frontiers . for a general introduction of the possibility of having neutrinos with energy @xmath12 gev ,",
    "see @xcite . the upper energy edge for these high energy neutrinos",
    "is limited only by the concerned experiments .",
    "more detailed general discussions in the context of high energy neutrinos can be found in @xcite . despite the availability of the somewhat detailed discussion of progress cited in the last reference",
    ", the field of high energy neutrino astrophysics is still passing through its initial stage of development .",
    "main terrestrial empirical highlights include the early discovery of the @xmath13 , the existence of three light stable neutrinos flavors @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well as the recent ( tentative ) evidence for the @xmath14 oscillations .",
    "the extra - terrestrial highlights include the observation of solar neutrinos and the @xmath15 oscillations for these neutrinos , the same from atmosphere of earth with atmospheric @xmath16 oscillations .",
    "the confirmation of role of neutrinos in dynamics of supernova core collapse via sn 1987a also needs to be mentioned here @xcite .",
    "the above highlighted empirical search has thus already given us quite useful insight into neutrino intrinsic properties such as mass and mixing .",
    "massive neutrinos and their associated properties such as dirac or majorana character of their mass , their mixings ( and magnetic moments ) can have important consequences in astrophysics . in this review",
    ", i shall discuss some of the selected consequences and the constraints implied by these consequences on neutrino properties as well as the insight that one may gain about the nature of the astrophysical ( or / and cosmological ) sites and the interactions that produce these high energy neutrinos .",
    "the explanation of observed solar @xmath0 deficit relative to its production value in the core of the sun , via @xmath17 conversion occurring inside the sun is an impressive example in this context @xcite .",
    "the general plan of this mainly pedagogical review is as follows . in section iia and iib , the presently envisaged motivations and absolute levels of the expected high energy neutrino flux from some representative examples of cosmos around us such as our galactic plane",
    "are presented .",
    "this includes also the one arising from the interaction of ultra high energy cosmic ray flux ( @xmath18 gev ) with the matter and radiation inside the sources ( such as center of our and other galaxies ) of as well as during propagation of ultra high energy cosmic ray flux to us . in section iic ,",
    "the effects of neutrino flavor mixing for high energy neutrino flux are discussed , whereas in sect .",
    "iid , main high energy neutrino interactions relevant for possible future observations are described along with a discussion of possibility of neutrino flavor identification .",
    "section iii gives the summary and conclusions .",
    "neutrinos with @xmath19 gev are expected to mainly arise from the interaction of ultra high energy cosmic rays considered to be protons ( @xmath20 ) here with the matter ( @xmath20 ) and/or radiation ( @xmath21 ) present in cosmos .",
    "examples of the astrophysical sites where these interaction may occur include the galactic plane , other sites within our galaxy as well as distant sites such as centers of nearby active galaxies ( agns ) and sites for gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "searching for high energy neutrinos thus can in turn also constrain the particle identity of ultra high energy cosmic rays .    as mentioned in the general introduction , here",
    "plan is to briefly review the present motivations of study of these high energy neutrinos .",
    "though , so far there is no observation of neutrinos with energy greater than few thousand gev , whose origin can not be associated with the atmosphere of earth , nevertheless , somewhat optimistically speaking , given the current status of high energy neutrino detector developments and the absolute levels of predicted high energy neutrino fluxes , it is expected that possibly the first evidence of high energy neutrinos may appear within this decade .",
    "a main motivation of high energy neutrino search is the quest of the microscopic understanding of the nature and origin of observed ultra high energy cosmic rays , namely the presently open questions such as whether they are protons , photons , neutrinos , heavy nuclei such as iron nuclei or some other particles suggested beyond the standard model of particle physics , and where and how they are produced or accelerated",
    ". a positive observation of high energy neutrinos can raise the possibility of simultaneous explanation of observed high energy photons ( @xmath22 gev ) and ultra high energy cosmic rays as a result of hadron acceleration and interaction in the presently expanding universe .",
    "neutrinos with energy @xmath12 gev can act as probes of the ultra high energy phenomena observed in the universe . unlike photons and charged particles such as protons and heavy nuclei , which can be absorbed or deflected by dust , other intervening matter or magnetic fields , neutrinos can more easily reach the earth because of their weak interactions with matter particles .",
    "it is therefore hoped that such neutrinos can provide information about the astrophysical ( or / and cosmological ) sources that will be complementary to inferences based on visual observations .",
    "a better understanding of the interactions involved in neutrino production and a more accurate estimate of resulting neutrino fluxes could entail important consequences . among these are insights into intrinsic properties of neutrinos such as mass and mixing @xcite , and the possible role of gravity on neutrino propagation in astrophysical environments @xcite .",
    "however , it all depends on the existence of a sizable high energy neutrino flux . assuming an existence of a sizable high energy neutrino flux , several of the other neutrino intrinsic properties as well as the useful information about the source producing these neutrinos can be obtained , at least in principle .",
    "these include testing neutrino decay hypothesis @xcite , constraints on neutrino magnetic moment @xcite , quantum gravity effects on neutrino propagation @xcite , tests of possible violation of equivalence principle by neutrinos @xcite , as well as information on different properties of relic neutrinos @xcite . also possibly enhancement in neutrino nucleon interaction cross section because of various new physics effects",
    "may be constrained @xcite .",
    "an early attempt to constrain the neutrino nucleon interaction cross section is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the relevant average physical picture in agns is as follows .",
    "some galaxies ( @xmath23 ) have quite bright centers .",
    "the photon luminosity of these galaxies typically reach ( @xmath24 ) erg s@xmath25",
    ". these galaxies are typically several mpc away from us ( where 1 pc @xmath26 cm ) . in general",
    ", agns refer to these bright and compact central regions , which may extend up to several pc in the center .",
    "these central compact regions have the remarkable property of being much more luminous than the rest of the entire galaxy .",
    "it is hypothesized that the existence of a super massive black hole with mass , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 g , may explain the observed brightness as this super massive black hole captures the matter around it through accretion .",
    "this super massive black hole is presently hypothesized to be formed by the collapse of a cluster of stars .",
    "some agns give off a jet of matter that stream out from the central compact region in a transverse plane and produce hot spots when the jet strikes the surrounding matter at its other ends . during and",
    "after accretion , the ( fermi ) accelerated ultra high energy protons may collide with other protons and/or with the ambient photons in the vicinity of an agn or / and in the associated jets / hot spots to produce unstable hadrons ( such as @xmath29 ) .",
    "these unstable hadrons decay mainly into neutral and charged pions .",
    "the neutral pions further decay dominantly into photons and thus may explain a large fraction of the observed brightness , whereas the charged pions mainly decay into neutrinos .",
    "agns , therefore , have been targeted as one likely source of high energy neutrinos . currently , the photohadronically ( @xmath30 ) produced diffuse flux of high energy neutrinos originating from agns dominate over the flux from other sources above the relevant atmospheric neutrino background typically for @xmath31 gev @xcite .",
    "for further reading on astrophysical super massive black holes , see @xcite .",
    "recently , fireballs are suggested as a possible production scenario for gamma ray bursts as well as high energy neutrino bursts at the site @xcite .",
    "though , the origin of these gamma ray burst fireballs is not yet understood , the observations suggest that generically a very compact source of linear scale @xmath32 cm through internal or / and external shock propagation produces these gamma ray bursts ( as well as burst of high energy neutrinos ) mainly in @xmath30 interactions . typically , this compact source is hypothesized to be formed possibly due to merging of binary neutron stars or due to collapse of a super massive star .",
    "thus , fireballs have also been suggested as a probable scenario for the observed gamma ray bursts , and they too are expected to emit neutrinos with energies in excess of thousands of gev , possibly above the atmospheric neutrino background . for a recent review , see @xcite .",
    "a nearby and more certain source of high energy neutrinos is our galactic plane .",
    "the incoming ultra high energy cosmic ray protons interact with the ionized hydrogen clouds there and can produce high energy neutrinos in @xmath33 interactions .",
    "present estimates indicate that the diffuse galactic plane muon neutrino flux can dominate over the atmospheric one for @xmath34 gev .",
    "other sources within the galaxy such as galactic micro quasars may also produce high energy muon neutrino flux around this energy .",
    "several types of interactions and the resulting unstable particles can in principle give rise to high energy neutrino flux in cosmos .",
    "for definiteness , here i shall consider only @xmath35 interactions to illustrate some examples of presently envisaged main source interactions and to classify the expected high energy neutrino production sites accordingly .    a presently favorable astrophysical ( or bottom up ) scenario for high energy neutrino production is that the    .comparison of the cross sections and average fraction of incident high energy carried by neutrinos for the three high energy neutrino production interactions discussed in the text at @xmath36 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     detailed estimates of the high energy neutrino event rates",

    "these estimates are model dependent .",
    "the event rates of downward high energy neutrinos typically vary between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in units of ( yr sr)@xmath25 for the proposed km@xmath39 volume ice or water neutrino detector .",

    "the three flavors on the average give rise to different event topologies based on these interactions and the behavior of the associated charged lepton .",
    "for instance , for @xmath43 , in proposed km@xmath39 volume ice or water neutrino detectors , typically the downward going high energy electron neutrinos produce a single shower , the muon neutrinos produce muon like tracks passing through the detector ( along with a single shower ) , whereas the tau neutrinos produce two hadronic showers connected by tau ( muon like ) track and is such that the amplitude of the second shower is essentially a factor of two larger as compared to the first . here , amplitude refers to maximum number of charged particles per unit length ( see right panel of fig .",

    "is included in the integral given by eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) .",
    "the shadow factor @xmath44 takes into account the effects of absorption by earth @xcite .",

    "the upward going tau neutrinos may reach the surface of the earth in a relatively small number by lowering their energy so that @xmath46 gev @xcite , whereas the upward going electron and muon neutrinos are almost completely absorbed by the earth .",
    "for further details , see @xcite .",
    "it might become possible to observe the ( air ) showers produced by charged leptons produced in neutrino nucleon interactions occurring near the surface of earth . here a cord of earth essentially equal to just one neutrino nucleon interaction length is considered to be traversed by high energy neutrinos before reaching the detector .",
    "this situation is in contrast to upward going high energy neutrinos which are basically completely absorbed by the earth because of multiple interactions @xcite .    for a recent discussion on prospects for observations of near horizontal high energy ( tau ) neutrinos ,",
    "see , @xcite , whereas for ultra high energy neutrinos , see @xcite .",
    "the emerging tau lepton spectra induced by quasi horizontal ( or earth skimming ) neutrinos , using monte carlo simulation techniques are calculated in some detail in @xcite .",
    "detailed study of high energy neutrino fluxes from different astrophysical sites such as the galactic plane , as well as other more far away anticipated astrophysical and cosmological sites will provide valuable information about the neutrino intrinsic properties and the site itself . given the current status of absolute level of expected high energy neutrinos , the detectors with area @xmath47 seems to be needed to obtain the first evidence .",
    "for more distant and energetic sources , the prospective high energy neutrino observation will provide clues for a solution of the long standing problem of origin of observed ultra high energy cosmic rays .",
