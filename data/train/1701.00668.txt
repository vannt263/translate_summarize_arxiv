    "in this paper we will analyze standard galerkin - finite element approximations to the periodic initial - value problem for the system of _ serre equations_. the system consists of two pde s , approximates the two - dimensional euler equations of water - wave theory , and models two - way propagation of long waves on the surface of an ideal fluid in a uniform horizontal channel of finite depth @xmath1 . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a typical wave amplitude , and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a typical wavelength , the system is valid when @xmath6 and is written in nondimensional , scaled variables in the form : @xmath7_{x}=0 .",

    "( for @xmath16 the left - hand side of ( [ eq12 ] ) is an @xmath17 asymptotic approximation derived from the equation of conservation of momentum in the @xmath8 direction of the 2d - euler equations ; ( [ eq11 ] ) is exact . )",
    "the system ( [ eq11])-([eq12 ] ) was first derived by serre , @xcite , and subsequently rederived by su and gardner , @xcite , by green _",
    "et al . _ , and green and naghdi , @xcite , @xcite , ( who extended it to the case of two spatial variables and variable bottom ) , and others",
    "it is also known as _ green  naghdi _ or _ fully nonlinear boussinesq system_. for its formal derivation from the euler equations and the derivation of related systems , cf .",
    "@xcite ; regarding its rigorous justification as an approximation of the euler equations we refer the reader to the recent monograph by lannes , @xcite , and its references .    in case one considers long waves of _ small amplitude _ , specifically in the _ boussinesq _ regime @xmath18 , @xmath19 , it is straightforward to see that the serre system becomes @xmath20 i.e. reduces ( if the right - hand side of the second equation is replaced by zero ) , to the ` classical ' boussinesq system , @xcite , which has a linear dispersive term in contrast to the nonlinear dispersive terms present in ( [ eq12 ] ) .",

    "li also provided a rigorous justification for the serre equations as an approximation of the euler equations .",
    "local well - posedness of the system in 1d in its variable bottom formulation was proved in @xcite . for results on the well - posedness and justification of the general 2d green  naghdi equations with bottom topography , we refer the reader to @xcite and its references .",
    "it should be noted that local temporal existence of the cauchy problem for the scaled equations ( [ eq11])-([eq12 ] ) may be established in intervals of the form @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 .",
    "it is not hard to see , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , that suitably smooth and decaying solutions of ( [ eq13])-([eq15 ] ) preserve , over their temporal interval of existence , the mass @xmath39 , momentum @xmath40 , and energy integrals . the latter invariant ( hamiltonian ) is given by @xmath41 dx .",
    "\\label{eq16}\\ ] ] in addition , as serre had already noted in the second part of his paper , @xcite , the system ( [ eq13])-([eq14 ] ) possesses solitary - wave solutions and a family of periodic ( cnoidal ) travelling wave solutions ; cf .",
    "also @xcite for the latter .",
    "closed - form formulas are known for both of these families of solutions .    in recent years many papers dealing with",
    "the numerical solution of the serre system and its enhanced dispersion and variable bottom topography variants have appeared . in these",
    "works the reader may find , among other , numerical studies of the generation , propagation , and interaction of solitary and cnoidal waves , of the interaction of waves with boundaries , and of the effects of bottom topography on the propagation of the waves .",
    "the numerical methods used include spectral schemes , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite , finite difference and finite volume methods , cf .",
    "e.g. the early paper @xcite , and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and its references , @xcite , @xcite , standard galerkin methods , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite , _",
    "et al_. in some of these papers the results of numerical simulations with the serre systems have been compared with experimental data and also with numerical solutions of the euler equations .",
    "these comparisons bear out the effectiveness of the serre systems in approximating the euler equations in a variety of variable - bottom - topography test problems , cf.e.g .",
    "@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , especially when the equations are solved with hybrid numerical techniques , wherein the advective terms of the equations are discretized by shock - capturing techniques while the dispersive terms are treated e.g. by finite differences , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite .    in the paper at hand",
    "we consider the periodic initial - value problem for the serre equations ( [ eq13])-([eq14 ] ) with periodic initial data on the spatial interval @xmath42 $ ] , assuming that it has smooth solutions over a temporal interval @xmath43 $ ] that satisfy @xmath44\\times[0,t]}\\eta(x , t)>0 $ ] .",
    "in section 2 we discretize the problem in space by the standard galerkin method using the smooth periodic splines of order @xmath45 ( i.e. piecewise polynomials of degree @xmath46 ) on a uniform mesh of meshlength @xmath47 .",
    "we compare the galerkin semidiscrete approximation with a suitable spline quasiinterpolant , @xcite , and , using the high order of accuracy of the truncation error ( due to cancellations resulting from periodicity and the uniform mesh ) , and an energy stability and convergence argument , we prove _ a priori _ optimal - order error estimates in @xmath0 , i.e. of @xmath48 , for both components of the semidiscrete solution .",
    "this is the first error estimate for a numerical method for the serre system that we are aware of .",
    "as expected , the presence of the nonlinear dispersive terms complicates the error analysis that is now considerably more technical than in analogous proofs of convergence in the case of boussinesq systems , @xcite , and the shallow water equations , @xcite .    in section 3 we present the results of numerical experiments that we performed in order to approximate solutions of the periodic initial - value problem for the serre equations using mainly cubic splines in space and the fourth - order accurate , explicit , ` classical ' runge - kutta scheme for time stepping .",
    "we check first that the resulting fully discrete scheme is stable under a courant number restriction , enjoys optimal order of accuracy in various norms , and approximates to high accuracy various types of solutions of the equations including solitary - wave solutions .",
    "we then use this scheme to illustrate properties of the solitary waves . in the preliminary section",
    "@xmath49 we compare by analytical and numerical means the amplitudes @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 of the solitary waves of , respectively , the serre equations , the cb system , and the euler equations , corresponding to the same speed @xmath53 , for small values of @xmath54 .",
    "our study complements the analogous numerical computations of li _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite , and our conclusion is that always @xmath55 and that up to about @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for larger speeds the solitary waves of both long - wave models are no longer accurate approximations of the solitary wave of the euler equations . in section",
    "@xmath59 we study numerically the _ resolution _ of general initial profiles into sequences of solitary waves when the evolution occurs according to the serre or the cb equations .",
    "the number of the emerging solitary waves seems to be the same for both systems and agrees with the prediction of the asymptotic analysis of @xcite .",
    "however , the emerging solitary waves of the cb equations are faster and of larger amplitude than their serre counterparts .",
    "finally , in section @xmath60 we make a careful numerical study of _ overtaking collisions _ of two solitary waves of the serre equations , as the ratio of their amplitudes is varied .",
    "we observed types of interaction that are similar to the cases @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 of lax s lemma @xmath64 in @xcite for the kdv equation .",
    "in addition , for the serre system , there is apparently another type of interaction , intermediate between lax s cases @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    in this paper",
    "we denote , for integer @xmath65 , by @xmath66 the usual @xmath0-based sobolev spaces of periodic functions on @xmath42 $ ] and their norms by @xmath67 .",

    "the oscillations of the dispersive tail behind the serre solitary wavetrains are much larger in amplitude and number than those of the dispersive tail in the cb case , which is a nonlinear feature of the serre system as the linearized equations of both systems coincide .",
