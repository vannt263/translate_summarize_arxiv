    "heavy quark production in high energy hadronic collisions consitutes a benchmark process for the study of perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "the comparison of experimental data with the predictions of qcd provides a necessary check that the ingredients entering the evaluation of hadronic processes ( partonic distribution functions and higher order corrections ) are under control and can be used to evaluate the rates for more exotic phenomena or to extrapolate the calculations to even higher energies .",
    "the estimates of production rates for the elusive _ top _ quark rely on the understanding of heavy quark production properties within qcd .",
    "much progress has been made in the field since the last  collider workshop in 1989 , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "being impossible to fit in the time allowed a complete review of these developments , i will shortly summarise them here before proceeding with the recent material , for the benefit of the unaware reader .    at the time of the last workshop ,",
    "one of the outstanding issues in the field was the disagreement between the measurement of the cern experiment ua1 of the b cross section at large  @xcite and the first theoretical calculation of this distribution at the next - to - leading order in qcd ( a.k.a .",
    "nde , @xcite ) .",
    "no results from the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) were available as yet .",
    "since then , new data from ua1 have come into nice agreement with the theoretical qcd expectations @xcite , and an independent qcd calculation has been performed by a different group @xcite , providing an important confirmation of the nde results .",
    "the dust on the ua1 new analysis had barely settled , when the success of qcd in describing the b production cross section was put into serious embarassement by the first results from cdf @xcite , indicating a significant discrepancy between the data and the same theoretical prediction working so well at the lower cern energies .",
    "this disagreement at higher energy , whose possibility had already been anticipated in the original nde article , was justified qualitatively by the inadequacy of a fixed order calculation in perturbation theory ( pt ) applied to processes probing initial state gluons at very small bjorken-@xmath1 . in this regime , in fact ,",
    "large corrections of order @xmath2^n \\sim [ \\as \\log(s / m^2)]^n$ ] appear at higher orders in pt .",
    "some of the most interesting theoretical papers in this period have been devoted to the development of techniques designed to resum these corrections @xcite . while it became clear that indeed these effects can increase the total b cross section by significant factors at asymptotic energies , the increase from 0.63 to 1.8 tev between the cern and fnal energies was seen to be insufficient to explain the factor of 3 or more observed rate discrepancy .",
    "alternative explanations have been attempted , most notably the possibility @xcite  that the gluon distribution function as determined from standard fits of low energy data is not known sufficiently well to allow a reliable extrapolation to the small values of @xmath1 involved in b production at the tevatron . while there is here some room for improvement , as shown in @xcite , it is my view @xcite  that with the most recent data and analyses of structure functions @xcite  it would be hard to account for a change in the expected b cross section as drastic as required by the first cdf data .    in the attempt to further probe the dynamics of heavy quark production ,",
    "a full nlo calculation of the @xmath3 correlations has also been carried out in the recent past @xcite .",
    "quantities predicted by this calculation ( a.k.a .",
    "mnr ) are , among others , the  distribution of the quark pair system ( ) and the shape of the  distribution ,  being the difference in azimuth between the quarks in the plane transverse to the beam axis . measurements of this distribution have been carried out both by ua1 @xcite  and by cdf @xcite , indicating good agreement with the expectations of nlo qcd . in this area",
    ", a recent study has improved the theoretical calculation of the mass and  correlations by including the effects of multiple soft gluon emission from the initial state @xcite .",
    "the corrections to the inclusive  distribution due to multiple soft gluon emission have also been calculated , in an important recent paper by laenen et al .",
    "since these effects contribute terms of order @xmath4^n$ ] , they turn out not to affect significantly the bottom cross section , while they can be of importance in the case of the more massive top quark , which is produced much closer to threshold and for which soft gluon exchanges are more important . a complete discussion of the results for the top can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "parallel to the theoretical developments , signficant improvements have taken place on the experimental side .",
    "we can now benefit from the presence of the new detector , d0 , whose preliminary b results have been shown also at this meeting @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the upgrade of the cdf detector with a silicon microvertex detector , capable of reconstructing the secondary vertices from b decays , is increasing cdf s ability to identify b s with reduced backgrounds @xcite .",
    "this is fundamental , for example , in separating the component of the s produced directly from those produced in the decay of b states .",
    "the new preliminary results on the  distribution of fully reconstructed b mesons , presented here by d. crane @xcite , suggest a decrease of the measured cross section in the small  region when compared to what previosuly observed @xcite .",
    "i collect in fig .",
    "[ fbcdf ]  the available cdf data and compare them with the nlo qcd calculation @xcite .",
    "6.5 cm    0.5 cm    6.5 cm    i pushed to the limit the input parameters of the theoretical calculation , namely the renormalization / factorization scale ( set to @xmath5 , with @xmath6 ) , and the value of  ( set to = 275 mev for the mrsd0 pdf set @xcite ) .",
    "this choice of parameters still provides an acceptable upper limit to the theoretical expectation .",
    "as clear from the plot , if the new data were confirmed in the final analyses by cdf and d0 , the discrepancy with theory would have disappeared , though at the expense of selecting extreme values for the theoretical input parameters .",
    "the situation with the b cross section at the tevatron is therefore what i would define as _ fluid _ :",
    "new data from hera in the small @xmath1 and large @xmath7 region will soon provide more reliable parametrisations of the gluon densities , and new data and analysis techniques from cdf and d0 will further reduce the experimental uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "in the rest of this report i will concentrate on two items :    * recent progress in the calculation of charmonium production * studies of charm and bottom jet production , both at the inclusive level and in association with electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "the interest in these two subjects arises from different observations .",
    "the driving force for the former is directly related to the measurement of the b cross sections : b decays are in fact an important component of the observed rates of charmonium states , , @xmath8 and . in the case of the , for example , it is currently believed from theoretical calculations @xcite  that almost 100% of the observed events result from b decays .",
    "large fractions are also expected for the .",
    "independent measurements of the b cross section , and knowledge of the decay branching ratios , will therefore provide by subtraction a measurement of the direct sources of charmonium , which can then be tested against our qcd production models .",
    "interest in the latter subject comes from several sources . to start with",
    ", the study of heavy quark jets ( namely jets originating from the evolution of a promptly produced @xmath9 or jets containing a heavy quark produced during the gluon shower evolution ) provides yet another test of our understanding of qcd .",
    "furthermore , b - jets produced in association with @xmath10 bosons provide powerful signatures for the detection of the top quark @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to understand all possible sources of backgrounds induced by direct production of heavy quark jets .",
    "the use of different data samples which are known not to be contaminated by a possible top , but which do contain at some level bottom or charm jets , allows to explore the performance of the heavy quark tagging techniques , and to determine the reliability of the theoretical expectations .",
    "finally , associated production of ewk bosons and heavy quarks has been suggested as a possible tool to study the heavy flavour content of the proton @xcite .",
    "a more thorough discussion of all of these questions will hopefully appear soon @xcite .    before concluding this introduction ,",
    "let me just mention an additional couple of very recent theoretical developments in the theory of heavy quark production in hadronic collisions , items which i will have no time to cover but which i want to point out to the interested reader .",
    "the first is the study of the interplay between a finite top decay width and the spectrum of soft gluon radiation emitted by the top itself and its decay products @xcite .",
    "the predicted correlations are very difficult to observe , but perhaps future large statistics of detected top and better confidence with new experimental techniques will open new exciting possibilities .",
    "the second subject is a recent calculation @xcite  of the resummed nlo high  behaviour of the @xmath11 cross section , performed by matching the nlo fragmentation function formalism @xcite  with the nlo massless matrix elements .",
    "the most important outcome of this study is the reduced sensitivity of the spectrum on the choice of renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "charmonium production in hadronic collisions has been measured both by ua1 @xcite  and cdf @xcite , and has been studied within qcd for quite some time now @xcite .",
    "however , all of the results available for production at large  are relative to leading order calculations .",
    "therefore the theory of quarkonium production is not as solid as the theory of open heavy quark production , and unfortunately a complete nlo calculation presents serious difficulties and lies years ahead of us .    at leading order ,",
    "large  charmonium is mostly produced via gluon fusion diagrams such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ ffragpsi ] .",
    "simple power counting in the propagators suggests that the production at large  is strongly suppressed : @xmath12 .",
    "this suppression can be understood physically as a sort of form factor of the charmonium state , form factor which is probed at @xmath7 values of the order of : it is hard to accelerate a  to a large  without destroying it in the process !    it was recently realised by braaten and yuan @xcite  that there is a class of higher order processes which are not suppressed at large  as the leading order ones .",
    "these are contributions where a high  gluon or charm quark will fragment into charmonium states ( fig .",
    "[ ffragpsi ] ) .",
    "while the probability that such a parton fragments into , say , a  is very small , this probability is a number relatively constant with  and the  will carry away a large fraction of the parton momentum . therefore the  spectrum of charmonium states produced according to this fragmentation mechanism is similar to that of the initial hard parton , namely something with an approximate shape @xmath13 .",
    "fragmentation functions for charmonium production from gluon and charm quarks have recently been calculated and their scaling violation studied @xcite .",
    "they can be convoluted with the inclusive  distributions of gluons and charm to give inclusive  distributions of charmonium states @xcite .",
    "some pieces are still missing , such as the fragmentation production of @xmath8 states .",
    "work on these is in progress , and for the time being a final prediction for the spectrum of s is still unavailable .",
    "a complete fragmentation calculation is available however for the , which does not receive contributions from @xmath8 decays .",
    "6.5 cm    0.5 cm    6.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fpsi2_th ]  i show the  distributions predicted at 1.8 tev from the three processes : direct lo production , gluon fragmentation and charm fragmentation .",
    "the fragmentation channels become larger than the lo contribution as soon as @xmath14 gev . in spite of this , however , the sum of all these terms is still small compared to the effect of b decays , and small compared to the current discrepancy observed between cdf data @xciteand the sum of b decays and direct production .",
    "a similar problem is apparent from the preliminary studies of the b fraction in  data @xcite , indicating a large contribution from non - b decays , incompatible with current estimates of direct  production .",
    "it is clear that more has to be learned about charmonium production in hadronic collisions .",
    "for example , there is a class of processes in between the lo and the fragmentation ones , which behaves like @xmath15 and which probably contributes significatly to the  region below 10 - 15 gev .",
    "these processes have not been calculated yet .",
    "new data and analyses dedicated to separate all possible sources of charmonium , for example by separating samples on the basis of the  isolation and impact parameter , will be fundamental to help theorists disentangle what today seems a rather embarassing issue for qcd .",
    "when discussing heavy quark production in hadronic collisions , is has become customary to refer to properties of the heavy quark themselves rather than to the properties of the jets in which they are embedded .",
    "for this reason , available calculations are always formulated in terms of the spectrum of bottom mesons and not of their jets .",
    "nevertheless , several measures of current interest , say tagging of b - jets produced in association with @xmath10 bosons , are formulated in terms b - jet energies .",
    "what makes this distinction interesting is the fact that different mechanisms will dominate production of b mesons at a given  and production of b - flavoured jets of the same .    with a language which is more pictorial than formal ,",
    "we usually identify three processes for heavy quark production : direct production , induced by @xmath16 scattering , gluon splitting , given by a standard qcd @xmath17 collision followed by the branching of a final state gluon into a @xmath3 pair , and flavour excitation .",
    "the frequently asked question `` which is the dominant process for @xmath11 production ? '' admits several answers , depending on the details of the events we are considering .",
    "for example , say we are interested in the azimuthal correlations , .",
    "if we consider a sample of events triggered by a 20 gev @xmath11 , we expect that phase space will suppress in part configurations at = 0 relative to @xmath18 .",
    "in fact configurations with = 0 require the presence of a stiff gluon jet recoiling against the @xmath19 pair , in order to compensate not only the momentum of the triggered @xmath11 , but also the momentum of the @xmath20 flying parallel to the @xmath11 .",
    "we expect the overall  distribution to be peaked at @xmath18 .",
    "if we trigger instead on a 20 gev b - jet , namely a 20 gev jet which contains a b quark , regardless of its momentum , configurations with = 0 and @xmath18 have the same phase space , as in both cases it is sufficient the presence of just two 20 gev jets : in one case the first jet is made of the @xmath19 pair and the second jet is a gluon ; in the other both jets are b jets from the direct production channel .",
    "the dynamics of the collinear gluon splitting enhances the = 0 region , compensating the presence of an additional power of , and one expects the resulting distribution to have a double peak structure , with peaks at = 0 and @xmath21 .",
    "all of these considerations are qualitative , and will vary with energy and other boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless one can observe their relevance by looking at fig .",
    "[ fdphi ] , where the two different cases are displayed for 20 and 50 gev jets .",
    "the calculation was performed using the fully exclusive nlo calculation by mnr @xcite , which allows to define b - jets using the standard cone algorithms applied to inclusive jets in hadronic collisions . here",
    "we define `` jet '' a set of one or two partons with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "more specifically a b - jet is a jet in which at least one of the forming partons is a @xmath11 , while a gluon jet is a jet just made out of one gluon . at the nlo ,",
    "the  of a gluon jet is by construction equivalent to the  of the heavy quark pair .    using the work of ref.@xcite",
    ", one can calculate the b - jet inclusive distribution , and then answer at the nlo in qcd another important question , namely `` what is the fraction of jets of a given  containing a heavy quark '' .",
    "to do this it is sufficient to compare with the available nlo calculations of the jet inclusive  distributions @xcite .",
    "[ fbincet ]  plots three nlo quantities : the inclusive @xmath11 ( and @xmath24 )  distribution ( i.e. the nde spectrum ) , the gluon jet  distribution and the b - jet inclusive  distribution .",
    "we applied no @xmath25 cuts in these plots . taking the ratio of the heavy quark jet  distribution with the inclusive jet  distribution",
    ", we obtain the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fbfrac ] , for charm and bottom jets . as a denominator",
    ", we used a lo calculation for the inclusive jet  spectrum . for @xmath26 and @xmath27 this was shown to lead to a result numerically equal to the nlo result .",
    "the results are consistent with indipendent estimates of the heavy quark content of gluon jets @xcite , and are consistent with calculations performed @xcite  using the shower monte carlo herwig @xcite .",
    "the flattening of the fractions at large  reflects the diminuishing percentage of gluonic jets in the inclusive jet sample with larger .",
    "since , as observed above , measurements based on the b  or b - jet emphasize differently the various production mechanisms , a direct measurement of the b - jet  distribution would provide a check of the nlo calculations which is complementary to the one performed using the standard nde spectrum and the b meson  distribution .",
    "associated production of photons and charm quarks has been suggested as a probe to study the charm density inside the proton @xcite .",
    "the dominant production process is in fact @xmath28 .",
    "the similar process @xmath29 would allow the study of the @xmath11 density .",
    "additional interest in this process arises because it is a potential background to the observation of the neutral current decay of a 4-th generation @xmath30 quark , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "finally , these processes provide a useful control sample for the study of heavy quark tagging .",
    "these processes are theoretically interesting because the density inside the proton of a heavy quark is in principle calculable perturbatively @xcite .",
    "neglecting higher order logarithmic corrections , which can be resummed using the altarelli parisi evolution , the inclusive process @xmath32 can be calculated by evaluating the partonic process @xmath33 and integrating over the phase space of the @xmath34 .",
    "this process is dominated by configurations where the quark being integrated over is produced at large rapidity and small .",
    "no divergence will appear , because of the heavy quark mass .",
    "a consistent definition of the heavy quark density , including thresholds effects , should then reproduce the result of this calculation .",
    "comparison against the experimental data is however important , to verify that no additional non - perturbative effect is at work .",
    "i show in fig .",
    "[ fgamma ]  the photon distribution in events with a central @xmath11 , calculated using the structure function approach ( @xmath35 , solid line , cteq pdf s @xcite ) and the exact matrix elements for the @xmath36 processes , where higher order corrections to the initial state evolution have not been included .",
    "the @xmath37 channel produces a heavy quark pair via gluon splitting , and can not be accounted for by the structure function calculation .",
    "as the plot shows there is perfect agreement between the two approaches , at least in the region where gluon splitting is small .",
    "this indicates that the effects of initial state evolution for the b quark at these values of @xmath1 and @xmath7 are not important .",
    "notice that this conclusion is important for the consistency of the nlo evaluation of the @xmath11 cross sections , which is performed without including flavour excitation diagrams @xcite , already accounted for at this order in perturbation theory by the nlo matrix elements .",
    "similar results are obtained in the case of charm production , where however there is some larger sensitivity to the choice of the charm mass .",
    "[ fgammatyp ]  finally contains the distributions of jets of various type produced with photons . because of the difference in charge and partonic density",
    ", associated production of @xmath11 is suppressed by a factor equal to 810 w.r.t . charm . as a curiosity ,",
    "notice that because of the suppression of the light - quark annihilation channel , it is more likely for a jet produced in association with a photon to be a charm jet rather than a gluon jet , at least for trasverse momenta up to 30 gev .",
    "this is a hot subject in these days , considering its implications on the search for the top quark .",
    "a detailed study can be found in ref .",
    "i will present here some additional remarks , mostly matured from the work of and discussions with various cdf collaborators , in particular g. unal and b. williams @xcite .",
    "given the importance of top search , it is important to be able to perform estimates of the backgrounds which are as much as possible independent of absolute normalizations provided by a theoretical calculation",
    ". the most straightforward approach would be therefore to simply assume that the fraction of b - jets in the inclusive jet sample is the same as in the @xmath10+jets sample .",
    "the first can be measured , and the rate as a function of jet  and possibly other jet features can be then applied to the @xmath10+jet sample ( see contreras presentation at this workshop ) . in this fashion any theoretical uncertainty on the absolute rate of inclusive @xmath10+multi - jet would drop out , being replaced by the observed cross sections .    a priori there are several reasons to expect this assumption to be too naive .",
    "first of all the inclusive jet sample has a large contribution from direct production of @xmath11 jets , contribution which is absent in the case of the @xmath10 sample , where all heavy quarks come from gluon splitting @xcite .",
    "secondly , the average fraction of gluon - initiated final state jets is different in the two processes .",
    "this difference will affect the rate of heavy quarks produced via gluon splitting .",
    "both these reasons point to a smaller fraction of heavy quark jets in the @xmath10 sample than in the inclusive jet sample , indicating that at worst the above background assumption was conservative .",
    "finally , even gluon jets of the same  in the two samples will have a different probability to produce @xmath3 pairs , because of the intrinsically larger @xmath7 scale of the collision producing a massive @xmath10 .    in spite of these differences",
    ", we expect the calculation of the relative fractions of heavy quark jets to be less affected by theoretical uncertainties than the absolute rates .",
    "the predictions can be tested on the inclusive sample of @xmath10 + one @xmath11-jet + x , which is not significantly contaminated by top .",
    "notice that for this calculation it is fundamental to keep into account the effects of the @xmath11 mass , in order to avoid divergencies associated with the integration over the second @xmath11 phase space @xcite .          without getting into the details of the calculation , performed using a mixture of the matrix element results of ref .",
    "@xcite  and herwig @xcite , i show an indicative result in fig .",
    "[ fwbb ] , which gives the fraction of @xmath10+multijet events containing a @xmath11-jet above 20 gev , as a function of the multiplicity of jets above a given  threshold .",
    "it appears that the probability per jet of being a @xmath11-jet is of the order of 1% , almost independently of the jet multiplicity .",
    "for comparison , i show in fig .",
    "[ fnjet ]  the same distribution obtained for generic multi - jet events . as expected , the fractions here are slightly larger , indicating that indeed the naive assumption that jets in the two samples have the same @xmath11-quark content is conservative . +",
