    "<S> modified quark fragmentation functions in deeply inelastic @xmath0 collisions and their qcd evolution equations are derived for the first time in the framework of multiple parton scattering . induced radiation gives rise to additional terms in the evolution equations and thus softens the modified quark fragmentation functions . </S>",

    "<S> recent theoretical studies @xcite show that a fast parton will lose a significant amount of energy via induced radiation when it propagates through a hot partonic matter . </S>",
    "<S> one can not directly measure the energy loss of partons because they are not final experimentally observed particles . </S>",
    "<S> however , parton energy loss does lead to modification of the final particle spectra . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can only study the parton energy loss indirectly by measuring the modification of the parton fragmentation functions in semi - inclusive processes like @xmath0 or @xmath2-jet events in @xmath3 collisions @xcite or the inclusive spectra at large transverse momentum @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter , we report our first study and derivation of the qcd evolution equations for the medium - modified fragmentation functions in the simplest case of deeply inelastic @xmath0 scattering ( dis ) . </S>",
    "<S> the induced gluon radiation due to multiple parton scattering gives rise to additional terms in the modified qcd evolution equations that soften the modified fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> utilizing the generalized factorization of higher - twist ( ht ) parton distributions @xcite , we show that these additional ht terms depend on both the diagonal and off - diagonal twist - four parton distributions , the combination of which clearly manifests the landau - migdal - pomeranchuk ( lpm ) interference pattern . using estimates of these twist - four parton matrix elements from other processes such as the @xmath4 broadening of drell - yan dilepton in @xmath5 collisions , </S>",
    "<S> we predict the modification of the effective quark fragmentation functions and their dependence on the parton energy and nuclear size . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate the quark energy loss defined as the total energy carried by gluons from induced radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the following semi - inclusive process in the deeply inelastic @xmath0 scattering , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the four momenta of the incoming and the outgoing leptons , @xmath9 is the observed hadron momentum , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denoted as @xmath12 \\label{eq : frame}$ ] , @xmath13 $ ] , are the momentum per nucleon in the nucleus with the atomic number @xmath14 and the momentum transfer , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the differential cross section for the semi - inclusive process can be expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the electromagnetic ( em ) coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> the leptonic tensor is given by @xmath18 while the semi - inclusive hadronic tensor is defined as , @xmath19 where @xmath20 runs over all possible final states and @xmath21 is the hadronic em current .    in the parton model with collinear factorization approximation and to the leading - twist ( lt ) the semi - inclusive cross section factorizes into a product of parton distributions , parton fragmentation functions and the partonic cross section . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to the leading order in @xmath22 , @xmath23 where the momentum fraction carried by the hadron is defined as @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the bjorken variable . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the factorization scales for the initial quark distributions @xmath28 in a nucleus and the fragmentation functions @xmath29 , respectively . including all leading log radiative corrections </S>",
    "<S> , the renormalized quark fragmentation function @xmath29 satisfies the qcd evolution equation @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will consider contributions of quark rescattering with partons from another nucleon inside the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> such contributions are proportional to the nuclear size @xmath30 @xcite . for large enough @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> , we can neglect other @xmath14-independent ht effects . for large @xmath31 in dis </S>",
    "<S> , it may suffice to only consider one rescattering . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of one rescattering can be treated as ht corrections to the lt results . </S>",
    "<S> we work in a framework @xcite in which the twist - four contributions can be expressed as the convolution of the partonic hard parts and four - parton matrix elements @xcite . at the lowest order , rescattering without gluon radiation as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) broadens the transverse momentum of the leading jet @xcite but contribute little to parton energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> one can also neglect rescattering with another quark in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the dominant ht contributions to the qcd evolution of the fragmentation functions come from radiative processes involving rescattering with a gluon from another nucleon as illustrated by the central - cut diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> kinematics only allows two poles , one at each side of the central - cut , out of the four propagators in the diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to four possible combinations each give different momentum fractions to the initial partons . </S>",
    "<S> in one case , the initial gluon has @xmath32 which is finite when @xmath33 , where @xmath34 @xmath35 is the transverse momentum of the radiated gluon , @xmath36 is the initial gluon s intrinsic transverse momentum , and @xmath37 is the momentum fraction carried by the final quark . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to gluon radiation induced by the rescattering and is referred to as a double - hard process . in another combination , @xmath38 which vanishes when @xmath33 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the rescattering is soft and the gluon radiation is induced by the initial hard photon - quark scattering . </S>",
    "<S> such a process is called hard - soft . the four contributions from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) correspond to these two distinct processes and their interferences . </S>",
    "<S> their sum has the form , @xmath39 this clearly manifests the lpm interference pattern caused by the destructive interferences between hard - soft and double - hard processes . </S>",
    "<S> the interference pattern is dictated by the gluon s formation time , @xmath40 , relative to the nuclear size . </S>",
    "<S> the two processes completely cancel each other in the collinear limit when @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> diagrams involving three - gluon vertices have exactly the same structure as fig .  [ fig1](c ) , except that they have different momentum dependence and color factor in the hard part .    </S>",
    "<S> we have considered all together 23 possible cut diagrams , 14 of them are interferences between no and double rescattering ( shown as the left and right - cut diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) ) which cancel some of the contributions from central - cut diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> including virtual corrections , we obtain @xcite the leading ht contribution from rescattering processes , @xmath42 \\ , , \\label{eq : wd - fq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is quark - gluon correlation function which essentially contains four independent four - parton matrix elements in a nucleus and @xmath44 . with the definition of the @xmath45 functions @xcite , the term proportional to the @xmath46-function accounts for virtual corrections and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : vsplit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can similarly get the contribution from the gluon fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> we will neglect the radiative corrections to processes such as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) that involve rescattering with a quark in the leading log approximation , because they can be shown to be proportional to @xmath48 @xcite as compared to @xmath49 in eq .  ( [ eq : wd - fq2 ] ) .    summing up all the leading contributions from lt and ht processes </S>",
    "<S> , we can effectively define the modified quark fragmentation function as @xmath50 where for completeness @xmath28 should also include the ht contributions as studied by mueller and qiu @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the modified quark fragmentation function satisfies the following evolution equation @xmath51 \\ , ,   \\label{eq : e - ap1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the modified splitting functions defined as @xmath52 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\label{eq : dsplit1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the normal splitting functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume in the leading order that the gluon fragmentation function follows the normal qcd evolution equations .    </S>",
    "<S> solving the above equation is equivalent to summing all leading log twist - four contributions . as an approximation </S>",
    "<S> , one can write the solution as , @xmath54 \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\label{eq : dmod}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 are the normal fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> notice that there is no collinear divergence in the above integration because of the lpm effect in @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath57 is proportional to @xmath48 , @xmath58 is suppressed by @xmath59 relative to the lt fragmentation function @xmath60 .    to estimate the twist - four parton matrix elements , we generalize the approach by @xcite to include the off - diagonal matrix elements . assuming a gaussian nuclear distribution in the rest frame , @xmath61 , @xmath62 fm , we express @xmath56 in terms of single parton distributions , @xmath63 ( 1-e^{-x_l^2/x_a^2 } ) , \\label{eq : tqg2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the gluon distribution per nucleon in a nucleus , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the nucleon s mass . </S>",
    "<S> the off - diagonal terms involves transferring momentum @xmath67 between different nucleons inside a nucleus and thus should be suppressed for large nuclear size or large momentum fraction @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath68 is the gluon s formation time . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the nuclear size in our chosen frame .    using the above approximation in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dmod ] ) and replacing the momentum fraction @xmath67 in the parton distributions by its average value @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\label{eq : modf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we choose the factorization scale @xmath73 . shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 are the numerical results of @xmath74 for three different values of @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameterization in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite of the normal fragmentation functions is used in our calculation . as we see from the numerical results , the modification to the shape of fragmentation function increases for larger values of @xmath75 corresponding to smaller quark energy @xmath76 at fixed @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the modification also increases for smaller values of @xmath77 corresponding to larger nuclear size . as shown in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : modf ] ) , the magnitude of the modification depends quadratically on the nuclear size . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the lpm effect modifies the transverse momentum spectra of the radiated gluon such that the phase space for the momentum integral is limited . </S>",
    "<S> that limited phase space is proportional to the nuclear size . </S>",
    "<S> together with the linear dependence of the parton correlation function , this leads to non - linear dependence of the total energy loss on the nuclear size .    we can define the quark energy loss as the momentum carried by the emitted gluons . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dmod ] ) , we have , @xmath78 according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath79 can be related to the transverse momentum broadening of drell - yan dilepton in @xmath5 collisions , @xmath80 in the rest frame of the nucleus , the total energy loss is @xmath81 which depends quadratically on the nuclear size . for @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 gev which is consistent with the estimate in ref  @xcite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have derived for the first time the evolution equations for the nuclear modified quark fragmentation functions due to multiple scattering and induced radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we can generalize our results to the case of hot qcd matter . in our approximation , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : tqg2 ] ) , the quark distribution which represents the initial quark production probability does not enter into the modified evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> what remains is the gluon matrix element . in the case of a hot qcd medium , </S>",
    "<S> the coordinates of the two gluon fields are not restricted to the nucleon size due to deconfinement in a nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the final results will be sensitive to the correlation length of the hot medium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if there is a dramatic change of the correlation length during the qcd phase transition , one should also see a big change in the modification of the parton fragmentation functions . </S>"
