    "the schwinger mechanism @xcite ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) is a phenomenon by which charged particles , e.g. electron - positron pairs , are produced spontaneously from an external electrical field .",
    "this phenomenon is non - perturbative since pairs can be produced even from a static electrical field , something which is forbidden at any finite order of perturbation theory by simple kinematical arguments .",
    "it is also a purely quantum phenomenon , whose probability goes to zero in the classical limit @xmath0 . loosely speaking ,",
    "@xmath1 vacuum fluctuations are promoted to on - shell real particles by picking energy to the electrical field  which can be viewed as a kind of quantum tunneling process .    in quantum electrodynamics ,",
    "the probability for particle production by the schwinger mechanism is of the order of @xmath2 , for particles of mass @xmath3 and electrical charge @xmath4 , in a field @xmath5 .",
    "for fields one may realistically create in experiments , and taking even the lightest charged particle , the electron , this probability is so small ( mostly due to the fact that the coupling constant @xmath4 is small ) that this phenomenon has remained elusive in all laboratory experiments so far ( the typical electrical field necessary to make the production of an electron - positron pair likely is of the order of @xmath6  v / m ) .",
    "the subject of pair production by the schwinger mechanism is also relevant in the context of quantum chromodynamics and strong interactions , since the strong coupling constant @xmath7 is much larger .",
    "it is for instance an important ingredient in hadronization models such as the lund string model @xcite , where the breaking of a `` string '' made of a color electrical field into quark - antiquark pairs leads to meson production .",
    "it is also an ingredient in several phenomenological models of heavy ion collisions , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it may also be a relevant mechanism of particle production in the color glass condensate framework ( see @xcite ) , that is commonly used in the description of the first stages of hadronic or nuclear collisions at high energy . in this effective theory ,",
    "the fast partons mostly gluons at high energy of the two colliding projectiles act as a static classical color source . the gluon occupation number , and",
    "therefore also this color source , increases with energy .",
    "eventually , when the gluon occupation becomes of order of the inverse strong coupling @xmath8 , nonlinear effects that tame this growth become important  an effect known as gluon saturation @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the color source corresponding to the fast partons is of order @xmath9 , and therefore it creates fields that are themselves of order @xmath9 .",
    "the probability of pair creation by such a strong field is not suppressed since @xmath10 can be large , unlike in qed . in @xcite , it has been argued that the cgc framework at next - to - leading order ( 1-loop ) includes the contribution of the schwinger mechanism to particle production .",
    "the color glass condensate provides a semi - classical description of the underlying dynamics : at leading order ( tree level ) , observables are computed by solving classical field equations of motion .",
    "this power counting is justified by the large occupation numbers and large fields that characterize the saturation regime , that allow one to neglect the non - commuting nature of the quantum fields and treat them as classical .",
    "the color fields obtained at leading order the glasma  @xcite are non - perturbatively large , of order @xmath9 , and can thus lead to a large pair production . at next - to - leading order ( 1-loop )",
    ", one can formulate observables in terms of small perturbations of this classical field  @xcite , that obey linearized ( and still classical ) equations of motion .",
    "equivalently , these 1-loop corrections can be calculated , and resummed , by computing a classical path integral where one sums over a gaussian ensemble of initial conditions for the classical field encountered at leading order .",
    "this approach , sometimes called classical statistical field theory , has been employed in a number of problems in cosmology @xcite , cold atom physics @xcite , and more recently in computations related to the thermalization of the quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the traditional method of computing the schwinger mechanism has been to obtain it from the imaginary part of the heisenberg - euler lagrangian @xcite , which in more modern quantum field theory language corresponds to calculating the imaginary part of the 1-loop effective action .",
    "it has also been derived in the framework of kinetic theory  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the schwinger mechanism was computed from the bogoliubov transformation that maps the creation - annihilation operators at @xmath11 onto those at @xmath12 .",
    "this requires that one solves the linearized equations of motion in order to obtain the time evolution of the mode functions ( i.e. modes that start as plane waves in the remote past , and are distorted by their propagation over the external field ) .    motivated by the applications of the classical statistical method to the cgc framework",
    ", we show in the present paper how the schwinger mechanism can be calculated in classical statistical field theory , despite being an intrinsically quantum phenomenon . in order to keep the formalism as light as possible",
    ", we consider scalar electrodynamics instead of qcd .",

    ", we describe the model and discuss two methods of calculating the spectrum of produced particles at leading order ; first in a rather standard quantum field theory formulation , and secondly as a classical path integral . in the section [ sec : num-1loop ]",
    ", we describe the lattice formulation of this calculation in order to evaluate the particle spectrum numerically , and then we compare the results of the classical statistical approach to the results obtained by the direct calculation of the 1-loop diagram , in order to show that they are indeed equivalent .",
    "we improve this calculation in the section [ sec : br ] in order to include the back - reaction of the produced particle pairs on the electrical field . indeed , this screening effect is crucial for proper energy conservation .",
    "the self - interactions among the produced particles , that are crucial for the eventual thermalization of the system , are considered in the section [ sec : self ] . since the issue of thermalization in classical statistical field theory",
    "has been addressed elsewhere , we focus here on the issue of mass renormalization , which plays a crucial role in the schwinger mechanism due to its extreme sensitivity on the mass of the particles being produced . finally , the section [ sec : conc ] contains some concluding remarks , while details about the mass renormalization are relegated to the appendix [ app : tadpole ] .",

    ", one must keep in mind that the concept of particle number in the presence of a non - trivial background field is not rigorously defined , since the particles we are trying to count are not free particles .      a typical graph contributing to the spectrum is shown in the figure [ fig : gen ] .",
    "the spectrum can be organized as a triple series expansion , in powers of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath4 , of the self - coupling @xmath20 , and of the external source @xmath21 .",

    "in particular , the total energy present in the system is not conserved at this level of approximation , because of the uninterrupted production of scalar particles , shown in the left plot of the figure [ fig : en - cur ] .",
    "one could in fact use this as a criterion for deciding when the one loop approximation ceases to be valid : it should be improved when the energy carried by the produced particles becomes of the same order of magnitude as the energy density carried by the electrical field .",
    "from the left plot of [ fig : en - cur ] , we expect this breakdown to occur as early as @xmath154 .. for the qed critical field strength @xmath155 , @xmath156 amounts to @xmath157 seconds .",
    "] this is also corroborated by the behavior of the electrical current carried by the produced particles . because this current acts as a source in the maxwell s equations that control the gauge potential , it can alter the background electrical field when it becomes too large .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that the plain 1-loop calculation of the spectrum of produced particles is bound to break down after some time , because this approximation violates energy conservation .",
    "what is missing is the back - reaction of the produced scalar particles on the electrical field , which has the effect of screening this field , which eventually will put an end to the production of particles  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the back - reaction means that the source of the electromagnetic field is not just the external source @xmath158 , but also includes the contribution of the scalar field @xmath13 to the electromagnetic current , @xmath159    \\nonumber\\\\    j^i ( x ) & = &     ie \\left [ \\phi^ * ( x ) d_i^+ \\phi ( x ) -\\left ( d_i^+ \\phi ( x ) \\right)^ * \\phi ( x ) \\right]\\ ; ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] written here with lattice discrete spatial derivatives . in the gauge @xmath135 , the maxwell s equation for the vector potential read @xmath160 the first of the two equations ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) is gauss s law .",
    "it is automatically satisfied if @xmath161 obeys the second equation , and @xmath15 is conserved . ] , @xmath162 which , in turn , is the case if the scalar field @xmath13 obeys the equation of motion .",
    "diagrammatically , solving simultaneously the equation of motion of the scalar field @xmath13 and maxwell s equations , starting from some initial condition @xmath74 at the time @xmath73 , amounts to resumming graphs such as the one represented in the left part of the figure [ fig : br ] .",
    "all the graphs are made of a principal scalar line , to which the measured particle of momentum @xmath23 is attached . to this line",
    "are attached a number of photons .",
    "these photons can either be attached to the external current @xmath21 , or to the induced current , i.e. to another scalar line .",
    "these secondary scalar lines can themselves be decorated by photons , etc ...    averaging the functional of @xmath92 obtained by this procedure over the gaussian distribution of initial conditions defined by ( [ eq : init - corr ] ) amounts to reconnecting pairwise all the hanging scalar lines in the graph of the figure [ fig : br ] .",
    "although all the topologies obtained when doing this were indeed present in the original quantum field theoretical formulation of the particle spectrum , some of them are miscalculated by the classical statistical simulation .",
    "this because in the css all propagators are retarded , while they are feynman propagators in the field theoretical calculation .",
    "however , when we reconnect together the two scalars that enter in the same instance of the induced current , the classical statistical approach reproduces exactly the qft value of that loop .",
    "this amounts to replacing the induced current @xmath163 in maxwell s equation by its ensemble average , @xmath164 by doing this , one obtains all the graphs such as the one represented in the right part of the figure [ fig : br ] , where the scalar loops represented in orange originate from the use of @xmath165 in the right hand side of maxwell s equations .",
    "although this is not manifest on this example , these scalar loops can themselves be dressed by an arbitrary number of photon insertions , whose other endpoint can either be the external current @xmath21 or another instance of the ensemble averaged induced source .",
    "let us now show some numerical results that illustrate the effect of the back reaction .",
    "first , in the figure [ fig : br1 ] , we display the electrical current density ( left ) and the resulting electrical field ( right ) .",
    "there in an inflection in the growth of the current at a time @xmath166 , which roughly corresponds to the moment when the energy carried by the produced particles becomes comparable to the energy stored in the electrical field .",
    "simultaneously , the electrical field decreases and even changes sign periodically , while the amplitude of its oscillations decrease to zero .",
    "consequently , the production of particles slows down and effectively stops after some time ( when the probability of particle creation , of the order of @xmath167 , becomes too small ) .",
    "it is rather easy to understand why the induced electrical field is opposite in direction to the externally field , as illustrated in the figure [ fig : ind ] . indeed , after having been produced , the positive charges are accelerated in the direction of the external field and the negative charges in the opposite direction .",
    "this charge separation acts like capacitor plates , that create an induced field oriented from the positive to the negative charges between them .",
    "this initial separation contributes to the polarization current , while the subsequent charge acceleration does the conduction current @xcite . ] .",
    "the induced electrical field thus counteracts the effect of the external field .    in the left plot of the figure [ fig : br2 ]",
    ", we see that the expansion of the @xmath151 spectrum towards the right is no longer linear in time , a direct consequence of the decreasing electrical field which is no longer providing a constant acceleration to the produced particles .",
    "in fact the plot on the right of the figure [ fig : br2 ] shows that for slightly larger times , the shift towards the right of the @xmath151 spectrum comes to a halt , and is replaced by a shift to the left .",
    "obviously , this happens when the electrical field has changed sign , around @xmath168 .",
    "after the @xmath151 spectrum moves into the negative momentum region , its value undergoes a rapid increase .",
    "this is because particles which have been created earlier pass through the zero - momentum region and stimulate the subsequent particle production ( bose - enhancement ) .",
    "at the same time , the @xmath151 spectrum starts to show an oscillatory pattern .",
    "this is due to an interference between the fields of the previously produced particles and of the newly produced particles  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the css method can describe this intricate pattern of peaks , that are purely quantum effects .    at even larger times ,",
    "when the electrical field has become small , the @xmath151 distribution becomes roughly centered around @xmath169 , as one can see from the plot on the left of the figure [ fig : br3 ] .",
    "because the electric field has changed its sign for several times , the spectrum has gone through several stages of bose - enhancement and is now much larger than its value at early times .",
    "finally , one can also check that the inclusion of the back - reaction effects cure the main problem of the plain 1-loop calculation , i.e. the energy conservation . in the plot on the right of the figure [ fig : br3 ]",
    ", we have represented the energy density carried by the produced particles , the energy density carried by the electromagnetic fields , and the sum of the two contributions .",
    "we observe a transfer into particles of the energy initially stored in the electrical field , while the total energy remains constant .",
    "so far , all the results we have shown have neglected the self - interactions of the scalar fields .",
    "this means that after the external electrical field has been `` neutralized '' by the produced particles , their distribution is frozen and ceases to evolve . in particular , it has no way to thermalize .",
    "the effect of these self - interactions has been studied in the classical statistical framework employed here , where it is rather straightforward to take into account since it just amounts to adding a non - linear term in the equation of motion of the classical scalar fields , @xmath170 written here for a quartic self - interaction . in the slightly simpler example of a real scalar field theory , it has been shown that these nonlinearities lead to the isotropization and thermalization . ] of the momentum distribution of the particles .",
    "diagrammatically , including the self - interactions in the classical equation of motion of the scalar fields changes the figure [ fig : br ] into the figure [ fig : br - si ] .",
    "in particular , the gaussian average over the initial conditions for the scalar field can now produce loop corrections such as ( but not only ) tadpoles .    our goal in this section in not to reproduce previous results on thermalization in classical statistical simulations , but to stress the complication due to mass renormalization , which is crucial when dealing with a tunneling phenomenon such as the schwinger mechanism .",
    "the main issue is that the probability of particle production by quantum tunneling is extremely sensitive to the value of the mass of the scalar particles , since its square enters in the exponential @xmath171 .",
    "however , when we include the nonlinear term in the equation of motion of the scalar field and we average over its initial conditions , we resum some loop corrections that are ultraviolet divergent . in a lattice simulation",
    ", they are regularized by the lattice spacing , but provide a potentially large renormalization of the mass that will alter significantly the production of particles by the schwinger mechanism .",
    "the worst offenders are the tadpole corrections , that have a quadratic dependence on the inverse lattice spacing .",
    "this problem is illustrated in the figure [ fig : ren ] .",
    "the black curve , which is almost overlapping with the orange curve , shows the spectrum of produced particles ( at @xmath172 , i.e. shortly after the external field has been switched on ) without self - interactions ( i.e. with a coupling constant @xmath173 ) .",
    "the ( bare ) mass in the lagrangian , and hence in the classical equation of motion , is @xmath143 .",
    "this curve should be compared to the blue curve , where the same computation has been performed with a nonzero self - coupling @xmath174 , and the same value of the bare mass .",
    "we see that the particle yield has been considerably reduced .",
    "as we shall argue , this is a consequence of the fact that these two computations correspond to two different values of the renormalized mass .",
    "this is an unphysical effect that should be fixed . indeed",
    ", one expects that the self - interactions among the scalar fields alter their long time evolution ( and in particular play a crucial role in their thermalization ) , but should have little physical effects at short times .",
    "this issue is also visible in the two plots of the figure [ fig : cur - l ] , where the computation at @xmath173 and the bare computation at @xmath174 lead to very different results , even at short times .",
    "as explained in the appendix [ app : tadpole ] , one can remove the quadratic divergence coming from the tadpoles by adding a mass counterterm @xmath175 in the equation of motion for the classical scalar field .",
    "this mass counterterm is space - time independent , and can thus be computed once for all at the initial time .",
    "we define it by @xmath176 which is directly given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : init - corr ] ) and is obviously independent of the external electrical field . with the value of the self - coupling @xmath174 that we are using , we have @xmath177 , which is why the calculation done without any mass renormalization gives a yield that is well reproduced by @xmath167 with @xmath178 ( see the figure [ fig : ren ] ) . in the figure [ fig : ren ]",
    ", we also show the @xmath151 spectrum obtained when this counterterm is added to the classical equation of motion .",
    "now , we see that the particle yield is back at the level expected for a renormalized mass that appears in the equation of motion should now be viewed as the bare mass .",
    "this bare mass combines with the tadpole that result from the gaussian average , in such a way that the renormalized mass is back at the expected value . ]",
    "similarly , the figure [ fig : cur - l ] shows that this mass renormalization cures the unphysical effect of the self - interactions at short times .",
    "motivated by recent works on thermalization in heavy ion collisions using classical statistical field theory , in which one computes 1-loop quantum corrections by performing a gaussian average over the initial condition of a purely classical field , we have applied the same method to the calculation of the schwinger mechanism of particle production in an external electrical field .",
    "we have first shown that , at leading order ( i.e. at 1-loop ) , the spectrum of particles produced by the schwinger mechanism can be expressed as a path integral over classical fields that have a gaussian ensemble of initial conditions . the 2-point correlation function that characterizes this gaussian distribution",
    "is uniquely determined by the propagator of small fluctuations on top of the external field .",
    "this representation of the spectrum is exact at 1-loop , and is a mere rewriting of the original quantum field theory result .",
    "moreover , this formulation of the spectrum leads to a very efficient method for the numerical evaluation of the spectrum on a lattice .",
    "then , by promoting the gauge potential to a dynamical variable , this formulation makes easy the inclusion of the back - reaction effects that are important for the physical consistency of the model .",
    "indeed , the charged particles that are produced via the schwinger mechanism tend to screen the applied external field , thereby reducing progressively their production rate .",
    "this back - reaction is essential for the conservation of total energy ( particles + electromagnetic field ) .    in the last section ,",
    "we have studied the possibility of taking into account the self - interactions of the produce charged particles , which is an essential ingredient for their eventual thermalization . in the classical statistical approach",
    ", they can be simply included by keeping the non - linear interaction term in the classical equation of motion for the field .",
    "however , since the schwinger mechanism is very sensitive to the value of the mass of the particles , it is important to take proper steps in order to renormalize the mass : the naive ( i.e. without any mass renormalization ) inclusion of the self - interactions leads to an unphysical lattice spacing dependent reduction of the charged particle yield , because the self - interactions produce large corrections to the mass .",
    "the main correction to the mass is a quadratic ultraviolet divergence that comes from tadpole corrections .",
    "we have shown that it can be systematically subtracted in the classical statistical framework by adding a mass counterterm in the classical field equation of motion .    to close this paper",
    ", we would like to digress with a remark regarding the applicability of the classical statistical approach to the calculation of observables .",
    "the example considered in this paper , as well as other quantities previously considered in the literature , is an inclusive observable .",
    "this means that it measures the expectation value of a certain operator ( here the particle number operator ) in the final state of the system , without putting any constraints on this final state .",
    "this is the reason why these observables can be expressed in terms of fields that obey retarded boundary conditions , which in turn are amenable to a computation in terms of a gaussian average over their initial conditions .",
    "very little is known about exclusive observables , whose definition veto certain final states .",
    "the archetypal example of this kind of observable would be the probability of producing a specific number of charged particles , which obviously excludes any final state that does not contain the expected number of particles . in some examples",
    ", it has been shown that exclusive observables can be expressed at leading order in terms of classical fields that obey non - retarded boundary conditions ( e.g. fields that are constrained both at @xmath12 and at @xmath11 ) .",
    "at least on the surface , it seems very implausible that such an observable can be obtained by a classical statistical simulation where one performs an average over the _ initial _ conditions of the classical field .",

    "the numerical part of this work was performed using the hpc resources from genci - ccrt ( grant t2013056929 ) .",
    "in this appendix , we show how to deal with the quadratic divergences that arise from the tadpoles when we keep the self - interactions in a classical statistical simulation . in this appendix",
    ", we disregard the coupling of the scalars to the gauge fields , since our purpose is to discuss an issue related to the scalar self - coupling .",
    "moreover , in order to keep the notations simple , we use continuum notations in this appendix . in practical applications to an actual lattice computation",
    ", all the integrals would become discrete sums .",
    "let us illustrate the issue in the case of the simple calculation of the expectation value of the field operator itself , @xmath180 .",
    "before we go further , it is useful to recall the green s formula that relates the classical field @xmath181 to its initial value at @xmath138 : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the free _ retarded _ green s function of the dalembertian operator . by iterating the interaction term",
    ", one sees that the functional dependence of @xmath72 with respect to its initial condition can be represented as a sum of tree diagrams , of the form : 1to 6 cm @xmath184 in this equation , we have represented the terms that arise up to the second order in the coupling .",
    "the vertical dotted line symbolizes the initial time surface @xmath185 , and the red circles the initial value of the field @xmath72 at this initial time .",
    "the average over the initial field is a gaussian average ; it can be done diagrammatically by introducing the following objects 1to 4 cm @xmath186 where the green dot represents the central value of the gaussian ensemble ) , that allows to have a non - zero @xmath180 for the purposes of the discussion in this appendix . ] , and the green link represents its 2-point correlation function . when we apply these diagrammatic rules to the expectation value of the field operator , we obtain the following contributions 1to 10 cm @xmath187 in this diagrammatic representation , the green lines and dots represent the average over the initial condition , while the black lines are genuine ( retarded ) propagators coming from the subsequent time evolution .",
    "the first line is the sum of tree level contributions , the second line is the 1-loop contribution , etc .. the tree level contribution ( first line ) is nothing but the classical field whose initial condition at @xmath138 is the central value of the gaussian ensemble , @xmath188 .",
    "we see that in the classical statistical approach , this classical solution is corrected by an infinite set of loop corrections .",
    "the tadpoles are the loops that have the strongest dependence on the ultraviolet cutoff . before going further",
    ", it is worth clarifying an important point : it is not obvious a priori that the tadpole - like subgraphs that appear in the diagrams of eq .",
    "( [ eq : avg ] ) are identical to the usual tadpoles encountered in feynman s perturbation theory .",
    "let us demonstrate that they are in fact equal . by using the green s formula ( [ eq : green ] ) ,",
    "the tadpoles of eq .",

    "( [ eq : avg ] ) , which is also the right coupling and symmetry factor .",
