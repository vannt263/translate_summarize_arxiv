    "solid solutions of zirconia ( zro@xmath1 ) containing other oxides are among the major representatives of modern ceramic materials .",
    "the wide range of applications , including traditional structural refractories , fuel cells and electronic devices such as oxygen sensors ,  @xcite testifies to the technological importance of zirconias .",
    "different divalent and trivalent oxides are added to zro@xmath1 in order to improve its thermomechanical properties , and charge - compensating vacancies are thereby introduced on the anion sublattice .",
    "the macroscopic effects associated with the impurities are very well known ,  @xcite but a microscopic model which gives a theoretical interpretation is still missing . as a preliminary step",
    ", this paper provides a physical picture of the crystal thermodynamics of pure zirconia , combining the results of first principles density functional and semiempirical tight binding ( tb ) calculations .",
    "zirconia has three zero - pressure polymorphs ; these have cubic ( @xmath2 ) , tetragonal ( @xmath3 ) and monoclinic ( @xmath4 ) symmetry .",
    "the high temperature @xmath2 phase @xcite ( _ fm_3_m _ ) is stable between 2570 k and the melting temperature of 2980 k. the @xmath3 structure @xcite ( @xmath5 ) , which is stable between 1400 and 2570 k , is closely related to the @xmath2 one : the internal degree of freedom @xmath6 shifts the oxygen ions away from the centrosymmetric positions along the @xmath7 mode of vibration ( figure  [ cellct ] ) and forces the @xmath8 ratio of the unit cell to adjust .",
    "below 1400 k the low - symmetry @xmath4 phase @xcite ( @xmath9 ) is thermodynamically stable .    besides its technological implications ,",
    "the relationship between these structures is of fundamental interest",
    ". the mechanisms of the phase transformations , the effects of impurities and vacancies on them , and their relationship to the nature of the bonding still require explanation , and this may shed light on the properties of other , more complex oxides .",
    "the crystal structure of purely ionic bonded materials can be determined on the basis of radius - ratio rules ,  @xcite based purely on electrostatic arguments . because of the small size of the zr@xmath10 ions , these rules place zro@xmath1 on the border between the 8-fold coordinated fluorite structure and the 6-fold coordinated rutile one ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the radius - ratio is too blunt a tool to account for the absolute stability of the unique 7-fold coordinated @xmath4 structure .",
    "the classical empirical models of zirconia are based on the _ a priori _ assumption of its _",
    "ionicity_. empirical approaches like the shell model ( sm ) or the rigid ion model ( rim ) described the structural ,  @xcite dynamical @xcite and transport @xcite properties of the phases on which they were parameterized , but failed to predict the absolute stability of the @xmath4 structure .",
    "the most detailed of such models was developed by wilson _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite whose environment - dependent compressible and polarizable ion model ( cim - dq ) demonstrated the importance of the anion polarizabilities at both dipole and quadrupole levels on the energetics of zirconia .",
    "however , further calculations  @xcite carried out with this model revealed that even though it predicted the correct energy ordering of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 phases , it predicted that the rutile structure should be even more stable , and this phase is never observed experimentally in zirconia .",
    "the experience gained with the cim - dq model suggests that a successful empirical model of zirconia should describe the effects of the atomic polarization , but should also go beyond a purely ionic description of the bonding .",
    "the partial covalent character of zirconia has already been postulated @xcite and is evident from electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory . in this paper",
    "we further investigate the recently proposed polarizable self - consistent tight binding ( sc - tb ) model @xcite which combines the physical concepts of covalency , ionicity and polarizability . using the sc - tb model we are drawn to the conclusion that the covalent character of the zr - o bond makes a significant contribution to the relative energetics of different structures , which would explain the limited predictive power of the previous ionic models .",
    "there have been several previous approaches to analyzing the structural and electronic properties of zirconia .",
    "boyer and klein @xcite used the apw method to derive pair potentials with which to investigate the equation of state of the @xmath2 phase .",
    "@xcite calculated the relative energetics and the elasticity using the potential induced breathing ( pib ) method based on the gordon - kim approach .",
    "@xcite studied the electronic structure with a first principles lcao method .",
    "the flapw calculations of jansen @xcite predicted for the first time the correct energetic ordering between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 structures at zero absolute temperature , identifying the double well in the potential energy that governs their relative stability . the double well",
    "was subsequently confirmed by _",
    "ab initio _ hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations ,  @xcite but these did not predict the stability of the @xmath4 structure over the @xmath3 one .",
    "only the very recent density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite consistently reproduce the relative energetics of the three zirconia polymorphs at 0 k.    the plan of the present paper is as follow . in section [ tb model ]",
    "we describe the model used in the calculations , the inclusion of the atomic polarizability in the tb framework and the parameterization procedure . a preliminary account of this work has been published .",
    "@xcite we have made dft calculations of band structures of the simple structures for this purpose , using a new full - potential , linear muffin tin orbital method ( nfp - lmto ) .",
    "the predictive power of the new model is tested against the dft calculations in section [ en - vol ] , where we study the relative energetics of zirconia .",

    "the results are summarized in the concluding section .",
    "in the tb approximation the crystal wave function can be expressed as a linear combination of atom - centered orbitals which we denote @xmath12 :    @xmath13    @xmath14 is a composite angular momentum index @xmath15 of the atomic orbital centered on the site whose position is * r * , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the band and @xmath18vector indices of the single particle wave function . for the purpose of derivation",
    ", we express the local orbitals as a product of a radial function and a real spherical harmonic @xmath19 although in our _ empirical _ tb scheme the explicit functional forms of the radial wave functions are not required . to simplify the notation",

    "the total hamiltonian @xmath22 can be expressed as a sum of two terms , @xmath23 . in traditional self - consistent ( sc ) tb , @xmath24 contains both on - site and inter - site terms .",
    "the on - site terms are diagonal in @xmath14 , and are often taken as hartree - fock term values of the isolated atoms .",

    "the additional part of the hamiltonian , @xmath25 , is diagonal in * r * and @xmath14 in the traditional approach ( majewski and vogl @xcite ) .",
    "it controls the charge redistribution between neighboring sites which results from the balance between the opposite effects due to the on - site coulomb repulsion ( hubbard @xmath26 ) and madelung potentials .",
    "what is missing in the previous model is the effect of the crystal fields on the valence electrons , _",
    "i.e. _ the atomic _ polarizability_. in a preliminary account of this work @xcite we indicated how to include the polarization effects in a sc - tb formalism by adding off - diagonal terms @xmath27 to the on - site blocks of the hamiltonian . here",
    "we describe how we make that extension .",
    "if we assume the on - site charge distribution to be localized , then its total multipole moment @xmath28 has a monopole contribution from the ionic core charge and a multipole ( including monopole ) contribution from the valence charge :    @xmath29    as stone @xcite points out , the electronic multipole moment on a site is the expectation value of the operator @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the charge of the electron .",
    "neglecting inter - site terms like @xmath32 for @xmath33 , the definition of the on - site multipole moment is therefore :    @xmath34    by invoking equations ( [ loc - orb ] ) and ( [ stone ] ) , the last factor of eq.([mpol ] ) can be expressed as a product of two quantities , the gaunt coefficients @xmath35 , which dictate the selection rules , and the integrals @xmath36 , which will be new parameters of the model :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 stands for the element of solid angle @xmath39 . the r@xmath40le of the gaunt coefficients , which depend on the angular part of the wave function only , is to select the term with symmetry @xmath14 arising from the coupling of the on - site orbitals @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the @xmath43 parameters , depending on the radial part of the wave function , determine the magnitude of the coupling .",
    "the substitution of eq.([product ] ) in eq.([mpol ] ) defines the multipole moment of symmetry @xmath14 on the site * r*.    having defined the on - site multipole moments , we can calculate the fields which they generate on all the lattice sites .",
    "the derivation uses standard results from classical electrostatics .",
    "the electrostatic potential is expanded in partial waves about the site : @xmath44 where , using the poisson equation , @xmath45 and @xmath46 the sum over @xmath42 is restricted to the values for which @xmath47 ; @xmath48 are proportional to the well known lmto - asa structure constants .",

    "the atomic environment of the high pressure phases is completely different to that of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 phases used in the parameterization of the tb model , therefore these orthorhombic structures provides a severe benchmark for the transferability of the tb parameters .",

    "the relationship between the cubic and the tetragonal phases is governed by a volume dependent double well in the potential energy . since the flapw calculation of jansen @xcite who predicted it first ,",
    "the double well has been confirmed by several other _ ab initio _ calculations and it is now well established .    in this section",
    "we analyze the nature of the 0 k energy surface by combining the information gained using two very different approaches : the nfp - lmto method and the polarizable tb model .",
    "the qualitative and quantitative agreement between the results of the two calculations , shown in the previous section , entitles us to use the physical picture provided by the simpler model to interpret the _ ab initio _ results .",
    "starting from the @xmath2 phase , the @xmath3 structure can be obtained by continuously stretching the unit cell along the @xmath2 crystallographic direction and by displacing the oxygen columns by @xmath6 along the tetragonal axis according to the @xmath7 mode of vibration ( figure  [ cellct ] ) .",
    "we calculated the total energy of the crystal using the two methods , for different values of ( @xmath6 , @xmath8 ) at several volumes .",
    "the energy curve exhibits a single well or a double well structure depending on the specific volume . at small volumes ,",
    "v@xmath97 , the tetragonal distortion is energetically unfavored and the equilibrium structure is cubic ( figure  [ well ] ) . when the cubic phase is stable , there is no distinct metastable tetragonal phase with which to compare its energy , so the energies of the two phases merge . at larger volumes ,",
    "v@xmath1 , a structural instability appears and the @xmath2 structure spontaneously distorts to the @xmath3 one ( figure  [ well ] ) .",
    "the curvature of the energy surfaces is related to the phase transition mechanism .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ well ] that @xmath98 is positive , while @xmath99 is negative : this suggests that the phase transition is driven by the @xmath6 instability and that the adjustment of the @xmath8 ratio is a secondary effect .",
    "the coupling between these two order parameters will be further discussed when we interpret the double well using landau theory .",
    "our lda and tb results for the depth of the double well at the @xmath3 phase equilibrium volume , v@xmath1 , are consistent with the recent lda values of @xmath100 7 mry .",
    "@xcite this energy barrier for the 6-atom unit cell corresponds to a temperature of @xmath100 1100 k. the same result was obtained by jansen @xcite with the flapw method who proposed a value of @xmath100 1200 k. it is natural that these temperatures , extrapolated from the 0 k potential energy , underestimate the experimental phase transition temperature of 2570 k.  @xcite the experimentally observed phase transition temperature can be considered as the sum of the kinetic contributions of all the activated eigenmodes , while the calculated energy barrier refers to the kinetic contribution of the @xmath7 eigenmode only .",
    "even though it is reasonable to expect that at the phase transition the soft mode in the phonon spectra ( figure [ phon ] ) will be highly weighted in the total density of states , the kinetic energy @xmath101 associated with all the other modes of vibrations will still contribute to the measured phase transition temperature .",
    "what causes the @xmath102 symmetry breaking ? the tetragonal distortion of the oxygen sublattice implies the following geometrical changes : ( i ) two zr - o bond lengths get smaller and two get longer but the average zr - o distance increases .",
    "( ii ) entire columns of oxygen atoms shift one with respect to each other ( see fig .",
    "[ cellct ] ) therefore the nearest neighbor o - o distances along the column remain constant while the other 4 nearest neighbor o - o distances increase .",
    "( iii ) all the zr - zr distances remain constant .",
    "the overall increase of both the zr - o and the o - o bond lengths is the basis of our interpretation of the double well , founded mainly on electrostatic arguments .    by adjusting the various parameters describing ionicity , covalency and polarizability of the tb model we can select and isolate the effects that induce the double well , but",
    "before doing so it is instructive to understand how a simple rim answers to the same question .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that it is possible to reproduce the double well with a rim in which there are two contributions : a repulsive short ranged pairwise interaction @xmath76 and a long ranged electrostatic term @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath103    @xmath104 is the ionic charge and @xmath105 is the interatomic distance between the ions @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the zr - o bonds increase and decrease in length in a symmetric way . as a net result ,",
    "the centrosymmetric position of the oxygen atoms is a relative maximum of the coulomb energy @xmath66 .",
    "the change in the madelung potential caused by the tetragonal distortion is shown in figure [ split1 ] ( a )",
    ". the overall increase of the o - zr and o - o distances makes the oxygen sites much more sensitive to the change of the madelung potential then the zirconium ones .",
    "the structural instability can therefore be interpreted as an effective way of minimizing the electrostatic energy of the oxygen sublattice .",
    "the repulsive zr - o interaction counteracts the structural instability driven by the electrostatics , in a way which dominates at large displacements because of the exponential distance dependence of this repulsion .",
    "the double well shape of the energy profile is due to the different functional form of these opposing energy terms of eq.([rim ] ) .",
    "this argument clearly depends on the strength of the repulsion , and does not work if the repulsion is too weak .",
    "it can be noticed that analogous terms are present in the tb model and a similar interpretation is tempting .",
    "however , we now have the additional effects due to polarization , covalency , and charge redistribution .",
    "figure [ split1 ] ( b ) shows that the absolute value of the self - consistent equilibrium charge @xmath108 decreases on both species .",
    "consequently , in this approximation ,",
    "the on - site energy @xmath109 \\ , , \\label{elcst - en}\\ ] ] plotted in figure [ split1 ] ( c ) , decreases not only because of the previous geometric arguments but also because the charge redistribution reduces the ionic charges and therefore both the o - o and zr - zr electrostatic interactions .",
    "it is interesting to note that , on the oxygen atoms , the self - consistent charge @xmath110 decreases with @xmath6 even though the total on - site potential [ the sum of the hubbard and electrostatic terms as in eq.([elcst - en ] ) ] increases .",
    "this non - intuitive behavior of the charge transfer is due to covalency .",
    "the charge transfer is controlled both by the on - site potential and by the bonding integrals , which depend on the zr - o distance . for @xmath111 ,",
    "the overall increase in the zr - o distance results in a decrease in the magnitude of the hopping integrals , and this overcomes the opposing effect of change in the on - site potential , _ pushing back _ some electrons from the oxygen to the zirconium sites .    in the cim - dq",
    ", it was the quadrupole polarization of the o ions which stabilized the tetragonal structure , so it is of interest to see if it is also the development of a quadrupole moment in the tetragonal phase which stabilizes it within the sc - tb model .",
    "in fact it turns out that covalency is the main effect , although polarizability is still significant .",
    "the @xmath3 structure is stable with respect to the @xmath2 one even with a _",
    "non _ polarizable sc - tb model [ figure  [ split2 ] ( a ) ] : the small energy difference is due to both ionicity and covalency of the crystal .",
    "the addition of the oxygen polarizability enhances the energy difference between the two phases deepening and broadening the double well [ figure  [ split2 ] ( b ) ]",
    ".    we can be more specific about the nature of the polarization . in the @xmath2 structure ,",
    "the first non - zero components of the electrostatic potential are @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the latter could , in principle , induce an octapole moment @xmath114 on the anions .",
    "we truncated the multipolar expansion of the atomic multipole moments to the quadrupoles @xmath115 therefore , within this approximation , the ions in the @xmath2 structure are not polarized .",
    "higher order terms can be included in the expansion , but the overall agreement of the results with both experiments and first - principle calculations demonstrates that the model is already capturing the important physics of the system .    as the anion sublattice is distorted , the symmetry lowering induces the @xmath116 and @xmath117 components of the potential which couple the @xmath81 and @xmath82 oxygen atomic orbitals .",
    "the magnitude of the coupling , and therefore of the multipole moments , is controlled by the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the latter , fixed in order to reproduce the electronic structure of the rutile phase , produces very weak quadrupole moments , whose contribution to the double well is negligible .",
    "the former controls the size of the dipole moments whose symmetric distribution further minimize the electrostatic energy [ figure [ split1 ] ( d ) ] . the total effect on the double well",
    "is shown in figure  [ split2 ] .",
    "the @xmath102 phase transition can be interpreted in terms of the landau theory .",
    "@xcite in a subsequent paper we plan to explore the free energy surface at @xmath118 with this formalism , so it is convenient to introduce it here to discuss the @xmath119 results .",
    "experimentally , the mechanism of this phase transition has been very controversial and a clear description is still missing .",
    "@xcite    theoretically , chan @xcite suggested that a partial softening of an elastic constant is the driving force of this phase transition and , after symmetry considerations based on the elastic strains only , concluded that the phase transition must be of first order .",
    "we show here that the inclusion of the order parameter @xmath6 gives a second order phase transition .",
    "a similar discussion has been given by ishibashi and dvok .",
    "@xcite    according to the landau theory , the appropriate thermodynamic potential which describes the relationship between the two phases of interest , is expanded in a taylor series in one or more order parameters , in which the expansion coefficients are temperature dependent .",
    "the order parameters are non - zero in the low symmetry phase and vanish in the high symmetry one , providing therefore a unique way to differentiate the two phases .",
    "the terms involved in the taylor expansion are invariants under the symmetry operations of the high symmetry phase and can be identified using group theory .    in the case of zirconia ,",
    "the @xmath2 structure is unstable along the three crystallographic directions , therefore the distortions along @xmath120 and @xmath104 have to be explicitly treated in the energy expansion .",
    "this suggests the following 9 order parameters , defined in terms of the strain tensor @xmath121 , and grouped into 4 symmetry - adapted bases which spans the corresponding irreducible representations :    @xmath122    a complete analysis involving all the order parameters will be done in a separate paper , here we simplify the total energy expansion selecting one of the three possible directions of the tetragonal axis . under this hypothesis",
    "three order parameters are necessary to describe the @xmath123 phase transition of zirconia : @xmath6 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the high temperature @xmath2 phase has the full cubic symmetry @xmath126 and the only degree of freedom is the hydrostatic strain @xmath127 .",
    "the low - symmetry @xmath3 phase is defined by the distortion of the anionic sublattice @xmath6 , which we define as the amplitude of the @xmath7 mode of vibration , and by the tetragonal strain @xmath128 .",
    "the three order parameters can be hierarchically classified according to the amount of symmetry breaking that they involve .",
    "the hydrostatic strain @xmath125 preserves the cubic symmetry of the crystal .",
    "the tetragonal strain @xmath124 maintains the number of atoms in the primitive cell and lowers the symmetry to the point group @xmath129 which still has the mirror symmetry operation perpendicular to the tetragonal axis .",
    "the tetragonal distortion @xmath6 breaks this symmetry operation and involves cell doubling .",
    "therefore , according to landau theory , @xmath6 is the primary order parameter , @xmath124 is the secondary and @xmath125 is the tertiary one .",
    "the potential energy is expanded as a power series in these order parameters around the equilibrium volume of the cubic phase @xmath112 ( figure [ envol - ct ] ) :    @xmath130    the elastic constants @xmath131 and @xmath132 are proportional respectively to the bulk modulus and to @xmath133 in the @xmath2 phase described in the next section .",
    "the third order term @xmath134 is forbidden by symmetry , therefore this transition is of second order if @xmath135 goes negative .",
    "the volume dependence of the order parameters can be studied by setting to zero @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "both the _ ab initio _ and tb results ( figure  [ landvol ] ) confirm the analytic expressions :    @xmath138    these expressions show that the second - order strain terms of eq.([lanexp ] ) are already proportional to @xmath139 and therefore , within the chosen order of approximation , it is not necessary to include third - order terms in @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , from the static results it is clear that the description of the high temperature stability of the @xmath2 phase must go beyond the quasi - harmonic approximation .",
    "the higher the temperature , the larger the volume and , according to figure  [ landvol ] , the larger @xmath6 and @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , in a simple quasi - harmonic picture , a higher temperature seems to favor the @xmath3 phase with respect to @xmath2 , in contradiction to the experimental observation .",
    "the parameters @xmath132 and @xmath131 are known from the elastic properties of the crystal and have been calculated independently ( see next section ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath135 and @xmath141 have been fitted to the double well of an undistorted stress - free cubic crystal ( in the sense @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) . in a similar way , @xmath144 and @xmath145 have been fitted to the double well of a tetragonal crystal at @xmath112 ( @xmath143 , @xmath146 ) and of a cubic crystal near @xmath112 ( @xmath142 , @xmath147 ) respectively .",
    "figure  [ lansurf ] ( a ) shows the three curves used for the fitting procedure . the agreement is very good even far away from the reference volume of the energy expansion [ figure  [ lansurf ] ( b ) ] .",
    "this demonstrate that the fourth order truncation in eq.([lanexp ] ) is sufficient to capture all the essential features of the 0 k energy surface .",
    "nardelli _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown the crucial r@xmath40le played by the coupling between different order parameters and how it can affect the correct interpretation of the phase transformation . to see this we substitute the relationships ( [ land - orvol ] ) back in eq.([lanexp ] ) :    @xmath148 \\delta^4 + { \\cal o}\\left ( \\delta^6 \\right).\\ ] ]    the above equation shows that the coupling term @xmath149 can renormalize the fourth order coefficient , and could make it negative . in that case it would be necessary to truncate eq.([lanexp ] ) at the sixth order term in @xmath6 , including therefore the third - order terms in the strain .",
    "these would then drive the phase transition making it first order .",
    "@xcite the numerical values of the coefficients ( table  [ landcfc ] ) allow us to estimate the amount of the coupling .",
    "we find that the coupling term is @xmath150 of @xmath151 , not big enough to affect the sign of the fourth order coefficient and therefore the 0 k calculations suggest that the phase transition is displacive of second order .",
    "the temperature dependence of the elastic constants might change this description and the final answer will be given by high temperature md calculations which are in progress .",
    "the elasticity of @xmath2 and @xmath3 zirconia has been explored with the tb model .",
    "the analysis involved the distortion of the crystal along high symmetry directions , the calculation of the total energy for different values of the distortion parameter and the fit of the results to a polynomial .",
    "the rigidity of the crystal with respect the particular distortion applied has been extracted from the quadratic coefficient of the energy series expansion . for each strain of the @xmath3 structure , we constrained the volume to the predicted equilibrium value and minimized the energy with respect to the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "volume conserving stretches along the high symmetry directions of the @xmath2 unit cell @xmath152 and @xmath153 provide @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively .",
    "extra distortions are necessary when the symmetry is lower : if @xmath104 is the tetragonal axis , an independent set of 5 shear moduli were obtained by stretching along @xmath152 , @xmath156 , @xmath153 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the bulk moduli have been obtained by fitting the energy - volume curves with a birch - murnaghan equation of state .",
    "@xcite    liu _ et al . _",
    "@xciteused the slope of the acoustic branches at small wavelength of a zro@xmath1-y@xmath1o@xmath159 ( 15 @xmath160 ) system to estimate the elastic constants of the cubic phase .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite directly measured the elastic constants of yttria stabilized zirconia ( ysz ) single crystals : the reference values included in table  [ elconst ] are extrapolations to 0@xmath160 impurities . to our knowledge there is no equivalent experimental study of the elasticity of the @xmath3 phase .",
    "the most recent values @xcite are measured via a powder diffraction technique on 12% ce - doped @xmath3 zirconia .",
    "we compare our predictions with theoretical and experimental data in table  [ elconst ] .",
    "the results of two other theoretical approaches , the hartree - fock and the pib ones , are very different .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , none of these calculations predicted the correct relative energetics of the crystal structures .",
    "elasticity is a property of the energy second derivative : a good description of the energy curves is a prerequisite for reliable elastic constant calculations .",
    "the fairly good agreement of our calculations with the experiments further indicates that the sc - tb model captures the main physics of the bonding .",
    "the bulk modulus , however , is seriously overestimated : this may not be an intrinsic limitation of the tb model , because it was fit precisely to the nfp - lmto calculation , which similarly overestimates this quantity .",
    "in order to test the model further , as well as to give further insight into the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath2 phase , we studied its vibrational properties .",
    "first principle calculations @xcite predict an imaginary frequency at the boundary of the bz : this reinforces the idea that the phase transition is displacive , and driven by the softening of an optic mode .",
    "our calculations were carried out with the tb model on a 96-atom unit cell .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the possible vibrational modes in that unit cell , were found by diagonalising the dynamical matrix which we calculated using the direct method .",
    "the procedure was as follows .    within the harmonic approximation ,",
    "the potential energy @xmath161 is expanded to second order in powers of the atomic displacements @xmath162 :    @xmath163    we use the notation of maradudin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite : @xmath164 and @xmath165 label respectively the atom in the primitive cell and the position of the primitive cell with respect to some origin .",
    "the direct method consists in computing the force constants @xmath166 via total energy and force calculations . in general , the atom @xmath164 in the @xmath165 cell is displaced by a small amount in direction @xmath167 and the hellmann - feynman forces on the other atoms are recorded .",
    "these give directly the quadratic terms in the total energy expansion .",
    "the force constants @xmath166 can be related to the corresponding term of the dynamical matrix * d * via the usual relation :    @xmath168    @xmath169 is the mass of the atom @xmath164 and @xmath170 is a point in the bz .",
    "the crystal symmetry can considerably reduce the number of necessary independent calculations .",
    "@xcite    the phonon spectra plotted along the high symmetry direction @xmath152 are shown in figure  [ phon ] .",
    "the main feature of the spectra is the imaginary frequency of the @xmath7 mode of vibration which corresponds to the tetragonal instability shown in figure  [ well ] .",
    "as already mentioned the tetragonal instability involves cell doubling therefore the corresponding eigenvector appears at the bz border of the @xmath2 phase .",
    "the soft mode at the @xmath171 point @xmath172 is the natural consequence of the negative curvature of the energy surface at @xmath173 ( figure  [ well ] ) .",
    "setting to zero the dipolar polarizability of the anions ( @xmath174 ) , the @xmath7 mode is still soft , @xmath175 , but the force constant corresponding to the instability is much smaller .",
    "this is consistent with figure  [ split2 ] where the same effect is studied from the energetic point of view : the energy curve is concave at @xmath173 even when the oxygens are not polarizable .",
    "the effect of the oxygen polarizability is evident on the @xmath176 ir - active mode , which involves the rigid displacement of the two atomic sublattices .",
    "the calculated vibration frequency is 7.9 thz when the anions are not polarizable and 6.3 thz when the dipolar degree of freedom is allowed .",
    "the closer agreement of the non - polarizable result with the dft frequencies of @xmath177 thz , together with the overestimation of the bulk modulus suggests that the present model could slightly overestimate both the short - range repulsion between closed shells of electrons , responsible for the high bulk modulus , and the long range polarization effects which make the @xmath176 frequency lower than the _ ab initio _ values .",
    "the results might be improved with a more accurate re - parameterization but the physical interpretation of the _ ab - initio _ results , which is the main objective of this analysis , is unlikely to change .",
    "table  [ phontab ] shows the general agreement of the tb model with other calculations and with the experimental data .",
    "the latter are measured by raman spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering at high temperatures on ysz .",
    "certain non - analytical terms in the dynamical matrix have been neglected , namely those relating to macroscopic polarization or the berry phase .",
    "for this reason our calculations can not reproduce the lo - to splitting of 12 thz calculated by detraux _",
    "et al._.  @xcite the non - analytical terms can be approximated by knowing the born effective charge and the dielectric tensor , both of which could in principle be obtained from our model .",
    "this has previously been done in a tb framework ,  @xcite although not for zro@xmath1 , and we plan to investigate the effect in the future .",
    "we have explored the predictive power of a polarizable sc - tb model by investigating the crystal stability of pure zirconia .",
    "the results of this extended tb model are in overall good agreement with our own _ ab initio _",
    "( nfp - lmto ) calculations and with previous experimental and theoretical _ ab initio _ studies .",
    "this semiempirical model has captured the basic physics of the relative phase stability of zirconia with a set of parameters which are transferable between the crystal structures .",
    "a noteworthy improvement over all previous models is the absolute stability of the monoclinic structure at 0 k with respect to the usual set of alternatives .",
    "this demonstrates that the model is ready to deal with more complicated crystalline environments such as solid solutions , high temperature distortions , or interfaces .",
    "the tb model predicts that the covalent character of the zr - o bond plays a major r@xmath40le in the energetics of zirconia , more so than the polarizability of the oxygen ions .",
    "for example , the double well about the cubic structure , absent in a rigid ion model , exists when covalency is included ; it is further enhanced by including also polarizability at the dipole level .",
    "we do not believe that the separation between covalent effects and polarizability effects is unique , since it depends on the choice of basis functions .",
    "quite possibly the previous polarizable ion models were capturing some effects of charge redistribution which could alternatively be described by covalency .",
    "it remains to be seen if a model for zirconia without explicit covalency could satisfactorily reproduce all the structural energies .",
    "the landau theory , used to interpret the tb and _ ab initio _ results , together with the lattice dynamic analysis , shows that the @xmath123 phase transition is displacive of the second order and is driven by the softening of the @xmath7 mode of vibration .",
    "if it had been driven by a softening of the corresponding elastic constant @xmath178 it would have been a first order transition .",
    "the partial softening of the elastic constants due to the temperature could also in principle change the character of the phase transition .",
    "we are currently applying the molecular dynamics technique to understand the high temperature thermodynamic stability of the @xmath2 phase and to explore the character of the phase transition . to this end",
    "we can use thermodynamic integration to go beyond the harmonic approximation .",
    "the preliminary results of these calculations will appear in the near future .",
    "@xcite    since the valence electrons are treated explicitly within the sc - tb model we also hope to be able to study the effects of point defects",
    ". this would be more difficult with a classical polarizable ion model because of the problems associated with charge conservation and redistribution .",
