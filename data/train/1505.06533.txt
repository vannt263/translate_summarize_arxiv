    "the low - lying elementary excitations of @xmath0-wave cuprate superconductors are known to be massless nodal fermions that have a linear dispersion and fulfill the relativistic dirac equation .",
    "these fermions govern many of the unusual low temperature properties of the superconducting state . in the past twenty years",
    ", there have been extensive experimental signatures @xcite supporting the fact that the nodal fermions are nearly non - interacting and have a rather long lifetime .",
    "however , this feature can be significantly changed if the fermions interact with certain critical bosonic mode .",
    "recently , various measurements observed an anisotropy in the physical properties of some cuprate superconductors @xcite . such an anisotropy is usually attributed to the emergence of a novel electronic nematic order @xcite , which spontaneously breaks @xmath1 symmetry of the system down to @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "both experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies suggest that a zero temperature nematic quantum critical point is therefore expected to exist somewhere in the superconducting dome . in the vicinity of this point , the nematic order parameter fluctuates quantum - mechanically around its vanishing mean value .",
    "the critical nematic fluctuation couples strongly to the nodal fermions , which gives rise to severe fermion damping @xcite and other striking properties @xcite .",
    "the quantum critical phenomena associated with the critical nematic fluctuation become more interesting , and meanwhile more complicated , when there are certain amount of disorders .",
    "disorders play an essential role in modern condensed matter physics @xcite , and can result in a plenty of prominent phenomena , such as anderson localization and metal - insulator transition .",
    "the past two decades have witnessed intense research activities devoted to the study of two - dimensional massless dirac fermions moving in a disordered potential .",
    "realistic systems that contain these fermions include the aforementioned @xmath0-wave cuprate superconductors @xcite , graphene @xcite , quantum hall effect @xcite , and topological insulators @xcite . in systems composed of dirac fermions",
    ", there can be three sorts of disorders @xcite . according to the coupling with nodal fermions",
    ", the disorders might be random chemical potential , random mass , or random gauge potential @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis has demonstrated that these disorders can produce different behaviors of dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "back to the @xmath0-wave cuprate superconductors , an important question is whether these disorders drive an instability of the nematic quantum critical point .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the influence of disorders on the low - energy properties of nodal fermions .",
    "recently , we have studied this problem by means of renormalization group ( rg ) techniques at the one - loop level @xcite . in particular , we have introduced a parameter @xmath3 to characterize the effective strength of disorder , and calculated the rg flows of @xmath3 after taking into account the interplay between fermion - nematic interaction and fermion - disorder interaction .",
    "it was found that @xmath3 vanishes in the low - energy region in the presence of random mass and random gauge potential @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath3 does not flow at all in the case of random chemical potential , i.e. , @xmath4 with @xmath5 being a running length scale @xcite .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath3 for random chemical potential is considered as marginal . in the other two cases , @xmath6 , so @xmath3 vanishes in the low - energy regime and is hence irrelevant . if the perturbative expansion is reliable , the result that @xmath3 vanishes in the low - energy regime obtained in the cases of random mass and random gauge potential will not be changed by higher order corrections . nevertheless , the same conclusion can not be simply reached in the case of random chemical potential .    in the spirit of rg theory @xcite ,",
    "the marginal nature of certain parameter is hardly stable against higher order corrections .",
    "it often happens that a marginal parameter is turned to marginally relevant or marginally irrelevant once higher order corrections are taken into account .",
    "these two fates of disorder parameter may induce different behaviors of physical quantities . in order to address this issue",
    ", we need to go beyond the one - loop rg analysis , and make detailed two - loop ( or even higher order ) calculations .",
    "interestingly , a recent work @xcite has revealed that two - loop corrections are able to make an important contribution to the quantum criticality of some particular three - dimensional dirac semimetals , which partly motivated the present work .    in this paper , we combine the @xmath7-expansion method and the replica technique to analyze the interplay of nematic fluctuation and disorder scattering ( in the following text we use `` disorder '' to uniquely denote random chemical potential ) .",
    "the perturbation expansion is carried out up to two - loop level .",
    "we derive a number of rg flow equations for fermion velocities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , velocity ratio @xmath10 , and disorder parameter @xmath3 .",
    "these equations are coupled to each other , and thus need to be solved self - consistently .",
    "we show that the parameter @xmath3 for random chemical potential becomes marginally relevant due to two - loop corrections .",
    "therefore , the interaction between nodal fermions and random chemical potential is always in the strong coupling regime at nematic quantum critical point , since any small parameter @xmath3 flows eventually to infinity at the lowest energy .",

    "now we consider the influence of random chemical potential . before running into complex numerical computation , it is helpful to first make a simple analysis about the behavior of parameter @xmath3 . from the flow equation of @xmath3 ( [ eq_disorder_two_loop ] ) ,",
    "it is convenient to extract a general differential equation , @xmath153 . apparently , the fate of @xmath3 in the low - energy region ( i.e. , large @xmath5 limit ) is unambiguously determined by the value of the coefficient @xmath154 : as the running length scale @xmath5 increases , @xmath3 flows towards infinity , vanishes , and stays at a certain constant for @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "previous one - loop calculations @xcite showed that the coefficient @xmath154 vanishes , so the strength parameter @xmath3 of random chemical potential is marginal and remains a constant as @xmath5 varies .",
    "after including two - loop corrections , @xmath154 may become either positive or negative , which will be addressed by solving the coupled flow equations ( [ eq_vf_two_loop ] ) , ( [ eq_vd_two_loop ] ) , ( [ eq_vdf_two_loop ] ) , and ( [ eq_disorder_two_loop ] ) .    the numerical solutions of rg equations with properly chosen initial values of disorder parameter are shown in figs .  [ fig_two_loop_with_disorder_me5 ] and [ fig_two_loop_with_disorder_me3 ] .",
    "as @xmath5 grows , @xmath3 increases quickly and eventually diverges in the limit @xmath158 .",
    "this behavior does not depend on the initial values of the running parameters .",
    "therefore , the strength parameter of random chemical potential , which is marginal at one - loop level , becomes relevant after including the two - loop order corrections .",
    "this change may have significant influence on the physical properties of the system under consideration since even an infinitesimal relevant parameter will flow to very large at ultra low energies .",
    "a natural question arises : how can we understand the marginally relevant nature of the characteristic parameter @xmath3 of random chemical potential and its impacts on the nematic quantum criticality in @xmath0-wave superconductors ? in the clean limit , @xmath159 , the strong quantum fluctuation of nematic order results in non - fermi liquid behavior of nodal fermions @xcite .",
    "once random chemical potential is introduced , the non - fermi liquid state is immediately turned into a diffusive metallic state @xcite , which has a finite zero - energy density of states and finite scattering rate .",
    "this conclusion is valid for all possible values of @xmath3 , since @xmath3 , irrespective of its initial value , unavoidably flows to infinity in the low - energy regime .",
    "in addition to the tendency of non - fermi liquid behavior due to the marginally relevant behavior of random chemical potential , we , within this section , try to delineate investigate the influence of nematic fluctuation , gapless qps and marginally relevant random chemical potential on a number of significantly physical observables in a @xmath0-wave cuprate superconductor at the nematic qcp , such as the superfluid density , critical temperature , and thermal conductivity .",
    "learning from the fig .",
    "[ fig_two_loop_with_disorder_me5 ] and the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec_numerical_discussions ] , we can be recalled some points . on the one hand ,",
    "the strength of random chemical potential , due to the marginally relevant behavior , flows away with the energy scale @xmath5 reaching a critical value , dubbed @xmath160 , at the nematic qcp .",
    "this indirectly triggers the unphyscial behaviors of fermion velocities @xmath8 and @xmath9 at a very scale @xmath161 which is dependent on the initial values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 by the growing strength of random chemical potential and will be carefully investigated in the following subsections . on the other hand , runaway behavior of physical quantities",
    "suggests a first - order phase transition  @xcite . in order to figuratively describe it in finite temperatures , we employ a useful formula @xmath162 @xcite ( @xmath163 is the critical temperature of superconductor ) to translate @xmath160 to @xmath164 .",
    "it is necessary to further emphasize that our effective theory and method are only valid for the continuous phase transitions and hence we subsequently focus on the critical behaviors of physical observables with the confined region @xmath165 , such as superfluid density , critical temperature and thermal conductivity .",
    "as studied by lee and wen  @xcite , the superfluid density in the noninteracting case exhibits a linear temperature dependence which is in agreement with experiments  @xcite @xmath166 with @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath20 represent the doping concentration and lattice spacing , respectively and @xmath169 by defining @xmath170 , reproducing the uemura plot  @xcite .",
    "the other term of right hand side is the contribution of the normal qps density . as presented in the previous section , the fermion velocities @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the ratio @xmath10 are heavily renormalized by the interplay between nematic fluctuation and the effects of random chemical potential in the vicinity of the nematic qcp",
    ". we can approximately derive the superfluid density of of the @xmath0-wave superconducting state at the nematic qcp which is renormalized by nematic fluctuation and marginally relevant random chemical potential  @xcite , @xmath171 where the normal qps density is complicatedly dependent on the fermion velocities @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath172 by combing the eqs .",

    ".  [ fig_thermal ] , the thermal conductivity of qps , influenced by nematic fluctuation and marginally relevant random chemical potential at the nematic qcp , is highly increased and insensitive to the initial values of random chemical potential .",
    "this may be helpful to enhance our understand the phase diagram of @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the impact of a particular disorder , namely random chemical potential , on the stability of nematic quantum critical point located in the superconducting dome of @xmath0-wave superconductors .",

    "the effective parameter that characterize the strength of random chemical potential is marginal at one - loop order , but becomes relevant due to the inclusion of two - loop order corrections .",
    "this means that , even if we start from a very weak disorder , the effective strength of disorder eventually becomes infinitely large at the lowest energy .",
    "the dirac fermions therefore enter into a diffusive metallic state driven by random chemical potential at the nematic quantum critical point @xcite .",
