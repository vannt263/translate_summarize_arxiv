    "we describe a new method for strengthening and extracting more information from the virtual biquandle counting invariants using yang - baxter cocycles together with cocycles from a cohomology theory associated to the virtual operation .",
    "in particular , the new invariants can detect non - classicality in some virtual links .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the basics of virtual knot theory ; in section 3 we recall virtual quandles and virtual biquandles . in section 4",

    "a _ classical oriented link diagram _ is a planar 4-valent directed graph with two edges directed in and two directed out at every vertex . the vertices are regarded as crossings , so one inbound / outbound pair forms an over - crossing strand and the other pair forms an under - crossing strand ; we indicate which is which by drawing the under - crossing strand broken .",
    "it is well - known that two classical oriented link diagrams represent ambient isotopic links iff they are related by a finite sequence of oriented reidemeister moves . here",
    "we depict the unoriented moves :    @xmath4    a _ virtual oriented link diagram _ is an oriented link diagram in which we drop the planarity requirement .",
    "we may draw such a diagram on an orientable surface @xmath5 with genus @xmath6 , and the represented _ virtual link _ is really an ordinary link whose ambient space is @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "classical links form a subset of virtual links . to draw an oriented virtual link on planar paper , we must distinguish crossings arising from genus in @xmath5 from ordinary _ classical _ crossings ( decorated vertices in the non - planar graph ) ; the former are called _ virtual crossings _",
    ", represented as circled self - intersections with no over / under sense .",
    "virtual links were introduced in @xcite and have been studied in many recent works .",
    "@xmath8    we may also represent an oriented link diagram using a _ signed gauss code _ in which every classical crossing is assigned a label and a plus or minus sign according to its local writhe number or _ crossing sign_.",
    "a signed gauss code is then the result of traveling around each component of the oriented link diagram in the direction indicated by the orientation and noting the order in which each overcrossing and undercrossing is encountered .",
    "the figure eight knot and its signed gauss code .",
    "@xmath9    indeed , signed gauss codes provide one motivation for studying virtual links ",
    "while not every gauss code corresponds to a planar link diagram , every signed gauss code can be interpreted as a virtual link diagram by simply inserting virtual crossings as needed while drawing the link .",
    "a _ virtual link _ is then an equivalence class of oriented virtual link diagrams or , equivalently , signed gauss codes , under the equivalence relation generated by the three reidemeister moves .",
    "since virtual crossings are not included in ordinary signed gauss codes , any two oriented virtual link diagrams with the same signed gauss code are equivalent .",
    "such diagrams are related by the _",
    "detour move _ , which can be broken down into four _ virtual reidemeister moves_.    @xmath10    @xmath11    we may then consider virtual knots to be equivalence classes of planar virtual knot diagrams under the equivalence relation generated by the three reidemeister moves and the detour move , or equivalently the three reidemeister moves and the four virtual moves @xmath12 and @xmath13 . note that while move @xmath14 permits a strand with only virtual crossings to be moved past a classical crossing , we can not move a strand with classical crossings over or under a virtual crossing , since this changes the gauss code and , generally , the virtual knot type .",
    "virtual crossings are not usually included in a signed gauss code , since in one sense the whole point of virtual crossings is to avoid testing codes for planarity .",
    "however , to compute the new invariants we will define in section [ inv ] , we will need to specify the location of our virtual crossings .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath15    the following observation will be useful .",
    "[ lem : v ] the classical and virtual ii moves , together with one oriented v or viii move , imply the other oriented v and viii moves .",
    "that is , we can reverse the direction of any strand in a type v or viii move using a sequence of ii and vii moves .",
    "we illustrate the case of reversing the virtual strand in a v move using virtual ii moves .",
    "the other cases are similar .",
    "the combinatorial approach to knot theory described in the previous section has a corresponding algebraic approach , which we now describe .",
    "the biquandle axioms are obtained by associating elements of @xmath17 to semiarcs ( i.e. , edges in the link diagram considered as a 4-valent graph ) in an oriented link diagram and letting these elements act on each other at crossings as pictured .",
    "the notation is chosen so that @xmath18 suggests `` @xmath19 under @xmath20 '' and @xmath21 suggests `` @xmath20 over @xmath19 . ''",
    "@xmath22    the set of biquandle axioms is then the result of checking the conditions imposed by a minimal set of oriented reidemeister moves .",
    "for example , the type ii reidemeister move with both strands oriented in the same direction ( the _ direct _ ii - move ) implies axiom ( 1 ) above : @xmath23 see @xcite for more .",
    "biquandles are useful for defining invariants of knots and links .",
    "specifically , for every knot or link diagram there is an associated _ knot biquandle _ defined as the quotient of the free biquandle on the set of semiarcs in the diagram by the equivalence relation generated by the relations determined by the crossings in the diagram .    given a finite biquandle @xmath0",
    ", we can obtain an easily computable link invariant by computing the cardinality @xmath1 of the set of biquandle homomorphisms from the knot biquandle @xmath24 of the link @xmath25 into @xmath0 .",
    "each such homomorphism can be pictured as a `` coloring '' of @xmath25 which associates an element of @xmath0 to each semiarc in @xmath25 such that the biquandle operations in @xmath0 are compatible with the relations determined by the crossings in @xmath25 .",
    "thus , for every finite biquandle @xmath0 there is a counting invariant @xmath1 .",
    "several recent papers describe examples of finite biquandles ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for example ) .",
    "one nice example is the family of _ alexander biquandles _ , where @xmath0 is a module over the ring @xmath26 $ ] of two - variable laurent polynomials with integer coefficients .",
    "such a @xmath0 is a biquandle with operations @xmath27 for example , for any @xmath28 we can get an alexander biquandle of cardinality @xmath29 by taking @xmath30 and choosing @xmath31 invertible elements of @xmath32 .",
    "[ tref ] @xmath33    we can specify a finite biquandle @xmath34 by listing its operation tables in the form of a block matrix @xmath35 $ ] ; for example the biquandle @xmath36 with @xmath37 from example [ tref ] has biquandle matrix @xmath38\\ ] ] where we use @xmath39 , x_2=[2]$ ] and @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "this notation has the advantage of letting us compute the counting invariant even in the absence of a convenient algebraic description of the structure of @xmath0 .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more .    for virtual knots",
    ", we can simply ignore the presence of virtual crossings and compute the counting invariant with respect to a finite biquandle @xmath0 , since the reidemeister moves are local and hence agnostic of the genus of the surface on which @xmath25 is drawn .",
    "an alternative idea is to consider virtual crossings in our algebraic structure , dividing our virtual link diagrams at both classical and virtual crossings and introducing an additional operation at the virtual crossings .",
    "this approach was taken in @xcite ; the resulting algebraic structure is called a _ virtual biquandle_.    @xmath41    at a virtual crossing , the semiarc entering from the right picks up an @xmath3 while the semiarc entering from the left picks up an @xmath42 : @xmath43    the pure virtual moves @xmath44 and @xmath45 require that @xmath3 is bijective , move @xmath13 imposes no conditions , and the oriented @xmath14 moves require that @xmath3 is an automorphism of @xmath17 ; see @xcite ( or , check it as an exercise ! ) .",
    "we may regard ordinary biquandles as the special case @xmath46 , so the theory of biquandles is a subset of the theory of virtual biquandles .",
    "given a virtual link diagram @xmath25 , one defines the _ knot virtual biquandle _ @xmath47 of @xmath25 as the quotient of the free virtual biquandle on the set of semiarcs in the virtual link diagram @xmath25 by the equivalence relation generated by the relations at the crossings in @xmath25 .",
    "as before , we can regard a homomorphism @xmath48 from the knot virtual biquandle of @xmath25 to a finite virtual biquandle @xmath49 as a coloring of @xmath25 , i.e. , an assignment of elements of @xmath0 to semiarcs in @xmath25 ( divided at both classical and virtual crossings ) such that the virtual biquandle operations are satisfied at every crossing .",
    "let @xmath17 be a biquandle and @xmath50 .",
    "then the two virtual biquandle structures @xmath51 and @xmath52 are isomorphic iff @xmath3 is conjugate to @xmath53 .",
    "an isomorphism of virtual biquandles @xmath54 is an automorphism @xmath55 such that for all @xmath56 we have @xmath57 , that is , @xmath58 or @xmath59 conversely , if @xmath60 in @xmath61 , then @xmath57 for all @xmath56 and @xmath2 is an isomorphism from @xmath51 to @xmath62    given a biquandle @xmath17 , we may list all virtual biquandle structures on @xmath17 by listing one representative from each conjugacy class of @xmath63    @xmath64\\ ] ]    if a virtual diagram @xmath25 represents a classical knot or link , then the counting invariants with respect to any two virtual biquandle structures on a given biquandle must be equal since both can be obtained from a diagram equivalent to @xmath25 with no virtual crossings .",
    "thus we have :    if @xmath65 for any two virtual biquandle structures @xmath49 and @xmath66 defined on the same biquandle @xmath0 , then @xmath25 is non - classical .",
    "@xmath67    the counting invariants associated to virtual biquandles provide a sharpening and strengthening of the biquandle counting invariants for virtual knots and links , while they coincide with the usual biquandle counting invariants for classical knots and links . in the next section",
    ", we will see a method for further improving and strengthening these invariants .",
    "the counting invariant @xmath1 associated to a finite biquandle @xmath0 is a computable and useful invariant of knots and links .",
    "however , a set is more than a mere cardinality , and it is natural to seek ways of extracting more information from the set @xmath68 .",
    "one very successful idea , with origins in statistical mechanics , is to associate to every crossing a function @xmath2 with values in some abelian group ; then for a given element @xmath69 , we can sum our values of @xmath2 over the crossings in the diagram colored by @xmath70 to obtain a _ boltzmann weight _ for @xmath70 .",
    "the set - with - multiplicities of all such weights for all @xmath69 is then an invariant of knots and links provided the function @xmath2 is chosen such that the boltzmann weight for each colored diagram is unchanged by reidemeister moves .",
    "the condition on @xmath2 required to make this happen turns out to be expressible in terms of a cohomology theory associated to the coloring quandle or biquandle @xmath0 .",
    "many variations of this idea exist , including the quandle homology described in @xcite , twisted quandle homology described in @xcite , quandle homology with coefficients in a quandle module ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the biquandle version known as yang - baxter homology ( @xcite ) , and a unifying approach to the homology of quandles and lie algebras ( @xcite ) .",
    "since our focus is on virtual biquandles , we will use the yang - baxter homology approach from @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will choose our coefficient ring to be @xmath71 for simplicity of computation",
    ". then if @xmath17 is a biquandle , a function @xmath72 is a _ yang - baxter 2-cocycle _ if @xmath2 satisfies @xmath73 for all @xmath74 . if @xmath75 for all @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the elements of @xmath17 from biquandle axiom ( 4 ) , then @xmath2 is a _ reduced yang - baxter 2-cocycle_. we will refer to such cocycles as _ classical cocycles_.    as implied by the term `` 2-cocycle '' , these functions @xmath2 are elements of the second cohomology in a cohomology theory , described in @xcite .",
    "the chain groups are generated by ordered @xmath29-tuples of biquandle elements , and the boundary map is obtained by interpreting an @xmath29-tuple as colors on a preferred path in the @xmath29-cube from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "such a coloring then extends in a unique way to the whole @xmath29-cube graph ; one then takes the usual boundary of the @xmath29-cube and interprets the faces as the @xmath80-tuples corresponding to their preferred paths .",
    "it is perhaps more enlightening , however , to consider the reidemeister iii move :    @xmath81    here the rule is that every positive crossing contributes @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the color on the undercrossing inbound semiarc and @xmath84 is the color on the overcrossing inbound semiarc , while negative crossings contribute @xmath85 where @xmath83 is the undercrossing outbound semiarc , and @xmath84 is the overcrossing outbound semiarc .",
    "this rule guarantees that the boltzmann weights are unchanged by reidemeister ii moves ; the cocycle condition takes care of the type iii moves and the reduced condition takes care of the type i moves .",
    "the classical yang - baxter 2-cocycle invariant is then @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the boltzmann weight of the homomorphism @xmath70 .",
    "finally , it is observed in @xcite that if @xmath88 is a yang - baxter coboundary then at every crossing @xmath70 effectively counts @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the inbound undercrossing , inbound overcrossing , outbound undercrossing , and outbound overcrossing semiarcs respectively .",
    "then since every semiarc appears in the sum once as an inbound and once as an outbound semiarc , the total boltzmann weight of a coboundary is zero and cohomologous cocycles define the same invariant .",
    "for virtual biquandles @xmath51 , we now define a second cohomology theory which we will use to augment the classical theory for defining invariants of virtual knots and links .",
    "first , we need a rule for contributions to the boltzmann weight from each virtual crossing in a virtual biquandle colored diagram .",
    "let @xmath92 ; then at each virtual crossing , we will count @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the biquandle color on the right - hand input semiarc , @xmath95 is the color on the left - hand input semiarc , @xmath96 is the output right - hand semiarc and @xmath97 is the color on left - hand output semiarc .",
    "@xmath98    the contribution to the boltzmann weight of a colored virtual link diagram with the above rule is unchanged by vi and vii moves .",
    "move @xmath44 : @xmath99 in the first move , the contribution to the boltzmann weight on the left is 0 , and on the right , the contribution is @xmath100 in the second move , on the left again we have a contribution of 0 and on the right we have @xmath101 .",

    "@xmath102 here , in the first move the contribution on the left is again 0 , while on the right we have a contribution to the boltzmann weight of @xmath103 . similarly , in the second move the contribution on the left is 0 while the contribution on the right is @xmath104 .    to deal with the virtual type iii move",

    ", we need to restrict our attention to a certain subcomplex .",
    "@xmath120 @xmath121    the map @xmath122 reverses the order of the components of its argument and operates on each by a power of @xmath3 so that the sum of the power of @xmath3 and the subscript of @xmath94 equals the position in @xmath122 of each entry .",

    "@xmath152    armed with our s - homology theory , we can see what kind of function @xmath92 must be to give the same contribution to the boltzmann weight before and after a viii move .    @xmath153    using our counting rule , the contribution to the boltzmann weight from the diagram on the left is @xmath154 while the contribution from the diagram on the right is @xmath155 note that @xmath156 so that @xmath157 iff @xmath14 evaluates to @xmath158 on @xmath159 for all @xmath160 .",
    "that is , the condition we need for the contribution to the boltzmann weight from @xmath14 to be invariant under @xmath13 moves using our counting rule is simply that @xmath161 .",
    "note that lemma [ lem : v ] implies that the other oriented virtual type iii moves are equivalent to the one depicted here .",
    "we are almost ready to define our virtual cocycle invariants .",
    "the final step comes from the last oriented virtual move , the mixed move @xmath14 .",
    "it is here that we get interaction between the classical and virtual cocycles .",
    "lemma [ lem : v ] and figure 5 of @xcite show that in the presence of the oriented classical and virtual type ii moves , a mixed move with one classical crossing is equivalent to ( 1 ) the same move with the classical crossing type switched and to ( 2 ) the same move with the orientation of the virtual strand reversed .",
    "thus , all eight possible oriented mixed moves are equivalent , and it is sufficient to consider only the one move pictured below .",
    "@xmath162    note that @xmath14 and @xmath2 are strongly compatible iff both are compatible with the zero cocycle .",

    "curiously , unlike in the classical case , coboundaries can contribute nontrivially to the boltzmann weight for a given coloring . more specifically , as in the classical case , a virtual coboundary breaks down into weights on semiarc endpoints , i.e. @xmath170 but even if both the classical and virtual cocycles are coboundaries , the weights do not cancel as in the classical case unless we have @xmath171 and @xmath172 for the _ same _ @xmath173 .",
    "thus , cohomologous cocycles from either complex do not necessarily define the same virtual invariant .",

    "first , for every classical biquandle @xmath179 , the zero virtual cocycle @xmath180 is compatible with every reduced yang - baxter cocycle @xmath2 ; this case is the classical yang - baxter cocycle invariant .",
    "secondly , evaluating the polynomial version of the invariant at @xmath181 ( or @xmath182 in the strong case ) yields the virtual biquandle counting invariant @xmath183 .",
    "moreover , in the strong case , setting @xmath184 yields the single - variable version of @xmath169 .",
    "lastly , if @xmath14 and @xmath185 are strongly compatible , then the presence of any nonzero power of @xmath185 in the two - variable version of the invariant indicates that the link in question is non - classical , since a classical link will always have a total contribution of @xmath158 from virtual crossings .",
    "in this section we present some examples of virtual yang - baxter 2-cocycle invariants .",
    "these were computed using ` maple ` with programs in the files ` virtualbiquandles-maple.txt ` , ` biquandles-maple.txt ` , and ` yangbaxtercohomology.txt ` , available at ` www.esotericka.org/quandles ` .    our ` maple ` notation uses gaussian integers for crossing labels in virtual signed gauss codes with imaginary part 0 for positive crossings , imaginary part @xmath186 for negative crossings and imaginary part @xmath187 for virtual crossings .",

    "moreover , the fact that cohomologous cocycles do not define the same invariant seems troubling , as does the fact that the degeneracy condition for @xmath3 2-cocycles is not just the coboundary condition .",
    "perhaps there is a deeper cohomology theory which unifies both the classical yang - baxter and @xmath3-homology theories ?",
    "it is because we suspect that such a theory awaits uncovering that we chose the term `` @xmath3-homology '' , preferring to reserve the term `` virtual biquandle homology '' for this deeper theory .",
    "other counting rules for contributions to the boltzmann weight from both classical and virtual crossings are possible , of course , and choosing different rules may result in different theories , defining potentially different invariants .",
    "we chose our rule for counting contributions from virtual crossings because it handles the @xmath44 and @xmath45 moves easily ; different rules might have other advantages and disadvantages .",
    "it is worth noting that the obvious alternative counting rules appear to suffer from the same deficiencies as the rule we ultimately chose , and most have the added disadvantage of requiring quotients to handle @xmath44 and @xmath45 moves .",
    "for example , if we count just @xmath204 instead of @xmath205 we can use the same boundary map @xmath111 , but two levels of quotients are required to handle the @xmath44 and @xmath45 moves .",
    "the virtual biquandle definition we used is the simpler of the two given in @xcite ; instead of using the unary operations @xmath3 and @xmath42 at virtual crossings , one can define a pair of binary operations at a virtual crossing , so that the virtual biquandle structure consists of six binary operations . a theory of cocycle invariants associated to this presumably richer virtual biquandle structure should prove interesting as well ."
