    "planetary nebulae show different morphologies , but since the works of kwok et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and balick ( 1987 ) , it is possible to reproduce their observed shape basically with two types of geometry : spherico - elliptical ones and bi - polar ones ( also called butterfly ) . the correlation between morphological types and other properties linked to the central star mass set constraints on stellar evolution theories ( e.g. stanghellini et al .",

    "a new modeling tool for studying the morphology and kinematics of pne is presented .",
    "this tool is first used to show that an equatorial brightness enhancement does not always correspond to a density enhancement .",
    "secondly we present two models for ngc  3132 .",
    "the first one is an ellipsoidal shell , as suggested in the literature , but which neither reproduces the density variation along the nebula , nor the velocity profiles .",
    "a diabolo shape is successful in reproducing consistently all the observations .",
    "the results of a 3d photoionization code ( gruenwald , viegas & broguire 1997 ) are analyzed through an idl ( rsi ) code , to generate images to be directly confronted with various kinds of observations .",
    "rotations , projections , line imaging , diagnostic line ratios maps , velocity line profiles and pv - diagrams can be performed .",
    "we computed two models of pne with the same ionizing spectra and the same mean density , the only difference being the matter distribution : the first one ( model 1 ) have a spherical cavity surrounded by a shell with a density gradient ( equatorial enhancement ) while the second one ( model 2 ) is a constant density ellipsoidal shell .",
    "the global spectroscopic results are similar .",
    "the theoretical line images are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - pap1 ] , showing an equatorial luminosity enhancement .",
    "one way to distinguish between the two geometries is a density map determined e.g. by the [ s  ii]6718/6732 ratio image .",
    "see morisset et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for more details .",
    "we applied 3d code to model ngc  3132 , classified as an elliptical pn .",
    "we adopt the central star and gas properties used by bssgen , diesch & grewing ( 1990 ) and perform two models differing in the gas distribution .",
    "we show that an ellipsoidal shell sucessfully reproduces the low resolution observations ( line images and the global spectroscopy ) .",
    "however , high ( spatial and spectroscopic ) resolution observations are not reproduced .",
    "observations of [ s  ii]6718/6732 line ratio indicate a decrease of the eletronic density towards the center of the pn ( juguet et al .",
    "the density variation modeled with the ellipsoidal shell ( fig.2 , dashed line ) can not reproduce the observed density decrease . choosing a diabolo morphology ( fig .",
    "[ fig - diab1 ] , right side ) we successfully reproduced the central density hole ( solid line , left side ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig - diab - hst ] the line images of ngc  3132 from hst observations ( top four panels ) are compared to the results of our diabolo model ( bottom four panels ) .",
    "the ellipsoidal image as well as the ionization structure are well reproduced with a 40rotation of the symmetry axes relative to the line of sight . adopting a linear velocity law",
    ", we can model the emission line profiles observed through various apertures .",
    "the observed [ o  iii ] profiles ( sahu & desai 1986 ) can be compared to the theoretical ones obtained with the diabolo model using their aperture size and positions ( fig .",
    "[ fig - diab_velo ] ) .",
    "notice that the asymmetrical profiles observed at the external part of the pn ( four bottom panels ) are not obtained with the ellipsoidal shell model .",
    "see monteiro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for more details",
    "we show that the lack of high resolution observations and of a 3d modeling tool , can lead erroneous conclusions about the morphology of pne .",
    "in particular , we showed that ngc  3132 was misclassified as an elliptical pn .",
    "a diabolo shape is successful in reproducing : 1 ) the density decreasing in the central direction of the pn , 2 ) the asymmetric [ o  iii ] velocity profiles observed at the external part of the pn .",
