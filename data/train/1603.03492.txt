    "understanding the production of the chemical elements in galaxies is vital to understanding the evolution of galaxies .",
    "in fact , the cosmic odyssey of the elements is fundamental to nearly all aspects of science , including the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , pei et al . 1999 ,",
    "pagel 2009 ) , the formation of planets , and the development of life .",
    "indeed , planets have been detected around stars older than even 11 gyr ( silva aguirre et al .",
    "understanding the early phases of metal production in the universe is thus crucial for a number of reasons .    especially interesting",
    "are the galaxies at redshifts @xmath8 , an epoch spanning the first @xmath9 gyr since the big bang .",
    "this epoch included the formation of the population iii stars and early generations of population ii stars .",
    "many recent theoretical studies have investigated the formation of metals in these early stars ( e.g. , maio & iannuzzi 2011 ; wise et al .",
    "2012 ; maio & tescari 2015 ) .",
    "these studies predict that nucleosynthesis by the early stars should give rise to rapid metallicity evolution and peculiar interstellar element abundance patterns in galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "supernova explosions of population iii stars can also contribute a significant amount of dust production in young galaxies ( e.g. , marassi et al .",
    "measuring the element abundances of galaxies at redshifts @xmath8 is , however , very challenging , since observations of emission from these galaxies are difficult .",
    "absorption lines in quasar spectra offer a promising tool to measure abundances in distant galaxies .",
    "the damped lyman - alpha ( dla , @xmath10 @xmath11 , wolfe et al . 1986 , 2005 ) and sub - damped lyman - alpha ( sub - dla , @xmath12 @xmath11 , proux et al .",
    "2003 ) absorbers are especially important for this purpose .",
    "a primary reason for this is that dlas and sub - dlas allow accurate measurements of the h i column densities from the damping wings of the lyman - alpha absorption lines .",
    "dlas have h i column densities @xmath10 @xmath11 and sub - dlas have h i column densities in the range @xmath12 @xmath11 ( proux et al . 2003 ) .",
    "given these large h i column densities , dlas and sub - dlas dominate the h i content of the universe , and therefore play an important role in the evolution of gas and stars in galaxies ( e.g. , prochaska & wolfe 2009 ; zafar et al .",
    "2013 ; popping et al .",
    "2014 ) .    the majority of past studies of element abundances in quasar absorbers focused on dlas , since owing to their large h i column densities , dlas were expected to be associated with star formation and chemical enrichment ( e.g. , nagamine et al . 2004 , pettini 2004 , wolfe et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it was thus surprising that recent studies of sub - dlas at @xmath13 showed the sub - dlas to be more metal - rich on average than the dlas ( e.g. , proux et al .",
    "2006 ; meiring et al .",
    "2007 , 2009a , b ; prochaska et al . 2006",

    "metallicity sub - dlas are found even at @xmath14 ( e.g. , som et al .",
    "the high metallicities are not an artifact of ionization , since the ionization corrections for most sub - dlas are relatively modest ( @xmath15 dex ; e.g. , dessauges - zavadsky et al . 2003 ; meiring et al . 2007 ; som et al .",
    "thus , sub - dlas appear to have undergone metal enrichment earlier and may be associated with more massive galaxies than dlas ( e.g. , kulkarni et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this raises the question of whether sub - dlas were more metal - rich than dlas even at higher redshifts , and whether sub - dlas with super - solar metallicities exist at even @xmath16 . at high enough redshifts , both sub - dlas and dlas",
    "should be metal - poor , yet at @xmath17 , they clearly differ in metallicity .",
    "thus , understanding when dlas and sub - dlas started differentiating chemically is of great interest .",
    "unfortunately , no reliable observations of quasar sub - dla metallicities exist at @xmath18 .",
    "a few limits exist for @xmath19 quasar sub - dlas ( e.g. , three o limits by prochaska et al .",
    "2015 ) ; but no definitive measurements have been reported .",
    "[ we note that metallicity limits based on undepleted elements also exist for a few @xmath20 dla / sub - dlas in the host galaxies of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; e.g. , kawai et al .",
    "2006 , ruiz - velasco et al .",
    "2007 , hartoog et al . 2015 ) , but most of these are based on low - resolution spectra . ]    in recent years , some quasar dlas at @xmath18 have been observed ( e.g. , rafelski et al .",
    "2012 , 2014 ) .",
    "these studies suggest that the relatively gentle metallicity evolution of dlas observed at @xmath21 holds back to @xmath22 ( although some other studies disagree  see , e.g. , jorgenson et al .",
    "furthermore , rafelski et al .",
    "( 2014 ) reported a sharp drop in the dla metallicity at @xmath23 .",
    "such a drop , if real , could signal a sudden change in the nucleosynthetic processes , perhaps indicative of an influence from population iii stars or early population ii stars .",
    "one complication in determining element abundances for dlas and sub - dlas is that the refractory elements get depleted into interstellar dust grains , i.e. , condense into the solid phase .",
    "elements such as fe , ni , cr , and to a somewhat smaller extent , si , are more depleted ( e.g. , savage & sembach 1996 ; jenkins 2009 ) , so it is more difficult to determine metallicities from these elements .",
    "reliable determination of the total ( gas + solid phase ) metallicities requires observations of volatile elements that do not show much depletion .",
    "the volatile elements most commonly used for determining metallicities of dlas / sub - dlas are s and zn . at @xmath18 , however , the only available lines of zn lie in the near - infrared , and thus are inaccessible to optical spectrographs .",
    "elements such as o and c can be used if their column densities can be measured without problems of line saturation .",
    "unfortunately , such dust - free measurements exist for only 3 dlas at @xmath24 .",
    "likewise , only 2 sub - dlas at @xmath16 have o or s measurements , of which neither is at @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , both of these measurements are limits based on a single saturated line , rather than definitive values based on multiple lines .",
    "in fact , none of the sub - dlas at @xmath26 have reliable o or s measurements .    here",
    "we report the first reliable quasar sub - dla metallicity measurement at @xmath27 , based on detections of undepleted elements in high - resolution data for a sub - dla at @xmath28 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations , data reduction , absorption line measurements , and column density measurements .",
    "section 3 discusses the results and compares the chemical compositions and physical properties of the sub - dla studied here with those of other sub - dlas and dlas presented in the literature .",
    "section 4 summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "the observations of the background quasar sdssj120207.78 + 323538.8 ( hereafter q1202 + 3235 , @xmath29 @xcite ) consisted of two exposures of 7200 s each obtained with keck hires on april 4 , 2010 as part of the program uh018hr ( pi a. wolfe ) and two exposures of 1800 s each obtained with keck esi on march 22 , 2009 ( program u143e , pi a. wolfe ) .",
    "the extracted , continuum - normalized , and combined hires spectra were downloaded from the kodiaq database ( omeara et al .",
    "2015 ) , and the raw esi spectra were downloaded from the keck observatory archive . the esi spectra were reduced and extracted using esiredux , an idl - based reduction package written by j. x. prochaska .",
    "the extracted esi spectra were split into smaller sections ( typically @xmath30  wide ) around the lines of interest , and these sections were continuum - fitted using the iraf `` continuum '' task . to fit the continuum in each section , we tried cubic spline polynomials typically of an order between two and six , and used the function that provided the best fit as judged from the rms of the residuals .",
    "the continuum - normalized sections from the two esi exposures were combined for each wavelength range using the iraf `` scombine '' task .",
    "in addition , the continuum around a few of the lines measured with hires was refitted using second order cubic spine polynomials in order to obtain a better continuum fit in these regions .",

    "it is clear from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ lyseries ] , that this @xmath36 value is fairly well - determined . since the blends with the other ly-@xmath33 lines makes the task of continuum determination challenging at these high redshifts , we make use of the small stretches of continuum seen on both sides of the line in estimating the continuum level .",
    "we note that the excess absorption seen to the left of the ly-@xmath34 fit near 6129  can not be attributed to ly-@xmath34 : if this excess flux is fitted as ly-@xmath34 , then the wings of the ly-@xmath33 fit are correspondingly wider than observed .",
    "column densities were determined by voigt profile fitting using the program vpfit version 10.0 . when fitting the metal lines , the low ions , o i , si ii , c ii , and feii , were fitted together , with the redshifts and the doppler @xmath37-parameters of corresponding components tied together .",
    "[ lowions ] shows the velocity plots for the key low - ion metal lines .",
    "we emphasize that all of these metal lines except o i @xmath38 976 lie _ outside _ the ly-@xmath33 forest , and thus allow accurate measurements of column densities .",
    "this fact is very important , since the primary reason for the dearth of measurements of weakly depleted elements such as o in @xmath8 dlas and sub - dlas is that their key absorption lines often lie within the ly-@xmath33 forest , which is very dense at these high redshifts . for c ii , only one line ( @xmath38 1334 )",
    "is covered outside the ly-@xmath33 forest .",
    "the c ii @xmath38 1036 line is strongly blended with the ly-@xmath33 forest lines , and therefore not useful .    while o",
    "i @xmath38 1302 can often be saturated in lower redshift dla / sub - dlas , it does not appear to be extremely saturated in the absorber of interest here .",
    "moreover , o  i @xmath38 976 is covered by the data .",
    "even though the higher velocity components of o i @xmath38 976 are blended with c iii @xmath38 977 and also the lyman-@xmath33 forest , the main component seen in o i @xmath38 1302 is also seen in o i @xmath38 976 ; thus we can obtain reasonable column density constraints by simultaneously fitting both the o i lines .",
    "the weaker components that are only fitted using o i @xmath381302 are weak enough that , even if their fits were not perfect , the change to the total o i column density would be insignificant . fig .",
    "[ oi_tests ] demonstrates what is gained by using the o i @xmath38 976 line by showing the effect of changing the o i column density in steps of 0.05 dex on the profiles of the @xmath38 976 and @xmath38 1302 lines .",
    "it is clear that even though the strongest component of o  i @xmath381302 changes very slowly , the corresponding component of o i @xmath38 976 quickly becomes too deep for the observed profile .",
    "thus , the o i column density is unlikely to be higher than our adopted best - fit value by much more than 0.10 - 0.15 dex . since the o i @xmath38 976 line is in the ly-@xmath33 forest , we also investigated the question of what the lowest o i column density consistent with o i @xmath38 1302 is . to do this , we examined the effect of decreasing the o i column density in steps of 0.05 dex below the best - fit value on the o i @xmath38 1302 profile . comparing the corresponding profiles with the observed o i @xmath38 1302 profile , we determine that the o i column density can not be lower than our adopted best - fit value by more than 0.10 - 0.15 dex . for si ii , simultaneous fitting of two lines ( si ii @xmath39 1304 , 1526 , both outside the lyman-@xmath33 forest ) allows us to obtain a robust determination of the line parameters .",
    "for fe ii , the only available line outside the lyman-@xmath33 forest is fe ii @xmath38 1608 , which is marginally detected .",
    "the stronger fe ii lines at longer wavelengths ( e.g. fe ii @xmath40 2382 , 2586 , 2600 are not covered by the hires or esi data at these high redshifts , while the fe  ii lines at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. , @xmath41 ) are strongly blended with the lyman-@xmath33 forest .    fig .",

    "the si iv @xmath38 1394 line from the hires data was fitted independently to obtain the velocity structure .",
    "this velocity structure was then applied to the same line in the esi data to confirm that the fit parameters gave the same column density . after confirming the hires fit worked on the esi data , the velocity structure , with the redshifts and @xmath37-parameters fixed ,",

    "we note , however , that more recent oscillator strength determinations exist for a few elements ( e.g. , cashman et al .",

    ", we used photoionization models using the plasma simulation code cloudy v. 13.03 ( ferland et al . 2013 ) .",
    "first , the absorbing gas was assumed to be a slab of constant density , illuminated by a radiation field consisting of a mixture of an intergalactic uv background , the radiation from o / b stars , the cosmic ray background and the cosmic microwave background at @xmath50 .",

    "the o / b stellar radiation was based on a kurucz model spectrum for a temperature @xmath51 k.    the observed si iv/ si ii and c iv/ c ii ratios were used to constrain the ionization parameter @xmath52 , i.e. the ratio of the number density of ionizing photons to that of the gas . to do this , grids of models",

    "the resultant ionization corrections ( @xmath58 = [ x@xmath59/h@xmath59 ] - [ x@xmath61/ h i ] ) are also fairly similar ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ ioniz_c ] and fig .",
    "[ ioniz_si ] ) . given that the si ii and si  iv column densities are better determined , we adopt the ionization parameter determined from si iv / si ii ; this implies ionization corrections of -0.37 dex for c , -0.001 dex for o , -0.40 dex for si , and -0.04 dex for fe .",
    "the corresponding ionization corrections from the c iv/ c ii constraint agree with the above values within @xmath62 dex .",
    "we next carried out cloudy calculations without assuming a constant density , but letting the density and radiation field intensity to be varied simultaneously using the `` optimization '' option .",
    "this approach gave a f higher ionization parameter log @xmath54 = -1.44 , and fairly similar ionization corrections for o , si , fe , i.e. , @xmath58 = -0.01 , -0.37 , -0.10 , respectively , and a somewhat different value for c , i.e. , @xmath58 = -0.47 .",
    "columns 3 , 4 and 5 , 6 in table 4 give , respectively , the abundances [ x / h ] and [ x / o ] derived using the above two sets of ionization correction estimates ( `` ic1 '' and `` ic2 '' , respectively ) .",
    "both determinations of the ionization corrections for o are essentially negligible ( @xmath63 dex ) .",
    "this is , of course , expected , since the ionization potential of o i is very close to that of h i. we therefore regard the o abundance as the most reliable indicator of metallicity in this system . for the remaining elements , we adopt the second set of ionization corrections ( `` ic2 '' , calculated with the optimization technique ) .",
    "this choice was made because there is no evidence to suggest that a constant density is a realistic situation , and thus the values returned by the optimization technique are likely to be more realistic .",
    "several peculiarities are seen in the overall relative abundances .",
    "relative to the solar ratio , c and fe are underabundant compared to o by 0.25@xmath64 dex and 0.58 @xmath65 dex , respectively . in other words , the c / o ratio is lower than in the sun by a factor of 1.78@xmath66 , while the fe / o ratio is lower than in the sun by a factor of 3.85@xmath67 .",
    "the most striking feature of the overall abundance pattern is that si is significantly under - abundant relative to o , with [ si / o ] of -0.50@xmath68 . in fact",
    "si is barely enhanced with respect to fe , with [ si / fe ] = 0.09@xmath69 . comparing the observed values [ si / c ] = -0.25 @xmath70 and [ si / o ] of -0.50 @xmath71 with the corresponding values in the warm milky way ism , i.e. [ si / c ] = -0.22 and [ si / o ] = -0.31 ( jenkins 2009 )",
    ", it appears that the gas - phase si / c ratio in our @xmath72 absorber is similar to that in the milky way , but the gas - phase si / o ratio is lower .",
    "thus this absorber does not show a clear evidence of alpha - enrichment .",
    "this suggests that the nucleosynthetic history in this @xmath72 absorber was peculiar , and/or that si is more preferentially depleted on to dust grains ( see sections 3.4 and 4 for more discussion of these points ) .",
    "we also note that the _ observed _ column densities would , at face value , suggest a significant c enhancement relative to fe , [ c / fe]@xmath73 = 0.69 . however , some of this excess is due to ionization effects .",
    "the ionization - corrected value is [ c / fe ] = 0.33 .",
    "thus , this absorber does not show the strong c / fe enhancement seen in some very metal - poor ( vmp ) dlas observed at lower redshifts ( e.g. cooke et al .",
    "2015 ) or in the c - enhanced metal - poor stars ( e.g. , aoki et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "how does this absorber compare to the handful of dlas studied at @xmath74 ?",

    "the [ si / fe ] in the sub - dla reported here lies in between these values .",
    "neither of these dlas from rafelski et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have reports of o abundances , so it is not possible to compare the substantially negative value of [ fe / o ] = -0.58@xmath77 in our sub - dla with that in other @xmath74 absorbers .",
    "to help put this chemically poor @xmath72 sub - dla in context , we also compare its relative abundances to those in the vmp dlas at @xmath78 ( e.g. , cooke et al .",
    "the [ fe / o ] value of -0.58 @xmath77 in our @xmath72 absorber is somewhat low compared to the typical value of @xmath79 for the vmp dlas .",
    "the [ c / o ] value of -0.25@xmath64 is comparable to the typical value of @xmath80 for vmp dlas , while the [ si / o ] value of -0.50 @xmath71 is much lower than the typical value of @xmath81 for vmp dlas ( cooke et al .",
    "thus the @xmath72 absorber studied here appears to have had a distinct metal and/or dust production history than the lower redshift vmp dlas .      the bulk of the o i absorption in this absorber is limited to a much narrower velocity range , while the si ii and c ii absorption is spread more uniformly",
    ". there thus appears to be a substantial difference between the relative c , o , and si abundances between the different components .",

    "the observed c ii/ o i and si ii/ o  i ratios in these two velocity components differ by factors of about 23 and 32 , respectively .",
    "we can not accurately estimate ionization corrections for these individual components seen in the low ions due to the different velocity structures of the low and high ions .",
    "however , based on the overall ionization corrections ( table 4 ) , it is clear that the large differences between the c ii/ o i and si ii/ o i ratios between these components originate at least in part in actual abundance differences .",
    "the overall under - abundance of c and si relative to o mentioned in section 3.2.1 ( obtained after summing over all velocity components ) seems to be arising primarily in the main component at @xmath84 .",
    "by contrast , the weaker component at @xmath85 ( which is at a velocity of @xmath8876 km s@xmath89 relative to the main component ) appears to have an enhancement of c and si relative to o. it is possible that this higher - velocity gas traces an outflow enriched by early stars .",
    "the main component , deficient in c and si relative to o , may be enriched by a different stellar population and may trace cooler gas with higher dust depletion .",
    "such abundance differences may be further aided by ionization differences to produce the observed large differences in the c ii/ o i and si ii/ o i ratios , if the outflowing higher velocity component gas is also more ionized ( and hence more deficient in o i ) than the main component .",

    "the kulkarni et al .",
    "( 2013 ) model includes population iii stars in the range 100 - 260 @xmath94 , but is dominated by population ii star formation , and thus not very sensitive to the population iii model .",
    "a few things are striking about these comparisons :    \\(1 ) the @xmath72 sub - dla lies below the extrapolation from the lower redshift sub - dlas , by 7.1 @xmath5 taking the upper limits as detections and treating the lower limits with survival analysis .",
    "the difference is 4.0 @xmath5 if the upper limits are treated with survival analysis , and the lower limits are excluded .",
    "even if the sub - dla trend is calculated excluding all the upper and lower limits , the @xmath72 sub - dla lies 3.6 @xmath5 below the extrapolation from that trend .",
    "in fact , this sub - dla also lies 3.7 @xmath5 below even the level expected at @xmath72 from the trend for @xmath95 dlas .",
    "given that this sub - dla was randomly selected based on only its high redshift , it appears that at these early epochs , sub - dla abundances may have been low .",
    "these results , together with the @xmath96 times higher mean metallicity of lower redshift sub - dlas , suggest that sub - dla metallicity may have built up rapidly between @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "of course , robust measurements ( not just limits ) of s and o abundances are needed for many more @xmath26 sub - dlas to verify if they are also metal - poor and if so , to determine how rapid the metallicity rise was .",
    "\\(2 ) the low metallicity of our @xmath72 sub - dla is consistent with both the maio & tescari ( 2015 ) model , which does not include population iii stars , and the maio & iannuzzi ( 2011 ) model , which does include population iii stars .",
    "this suggests that the left - over signatures of population iii enrichment may not be significant at @xmath99 .",
    "our observed value is lower than the prediction from the model of kulkarni et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ; however , the predicted trend is sensitive to the delay time involved in the metal enrichment of the interstellar gas by supernovae ( kulkarni et al .",
    ". more gradual enrichment may give better agreement with the metallicity observed at @xmath72 .",
    "future measurements of metallicities and relative element abundances in more sub - dlas and dlas at @xmath20 can potentially help to discern more definitively between different chemical evolution models .",
    "we note that none of these three models agree with the lower redshift sub - dla data , even though two of them are consistent with the @xmath72 measurement .",
    "additionally , we note that the metallicity evolution of a given galaxy depends on the halo mass , and the mean metallicity evolution trends predicted by the models depend on the halo mass distribution ( e.g. , kulkarni et al . 2013 , 2014 ) .",
    "thus , if the halo mass distribution of sub - dla host galaxies has evolved between @xmath72 and @xmath100 , that may explain in part why the models do not fit the sub - dla data well across the whole redshift range .",
    "\\(3 ) we also note that the @xmath93 dlas appear to be consistent with the extrapolation from the lower redshift dlas .",
    "this contrasts with the sudden drop of metallicity at @xmath23 claimed by rafelski et al .",
    "this difference stems from the fact that we have focused only on s and o measurements , while most of the measurements of rafelski et al .",
    "( 2014 ) were for si and fe , elements that are known to be depleted on dust grains in the milky way .",
    "it is therefore important to track down whether the difference is a result of dust depletion of si and fe .",
    "we stress that dust depletion can not be ignored , given the evidence for dust at high redshift ( e.g. , from @xmath98 sub - mm galaxies , coppin et al .",
    "2009 , walter et al .",
    "2012 , casey et al .",
    "furthermore , the supernova explosions of early stars are more likely to produce silicate dust ( e.g. , cherchneff & dwek 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "marassi et al .",
    "( 2015 ) find that standard core - collapse population iii supernovae can produce dust efficiently , in the range of 0.2 - 3 @xmath94 , and that this dust is predominantly silicate .",
    "given such efficient production of silicate dust , the gas in high - redshift galaxies could show stronger depletion of si than in the milky way .",
    "thus the sudden metallicity drop claimed at @xmath23 could be due to higher depletion levels .",
    "finally we note that a roughly comparable metallicity lower limit ( @xmath101 dex ) has been reported for a @xmath102 sub - dla associated with a grb host ( hartoog et al .",
    "the higher metallicity of the latter system compared to our @xmath72 quasar sub - dla may be due to a higher - than - average star formation rate in the grb host galaxy .",
    "a comparison of the abundances of refractory and volatile elements offers a tool to estimate the extent of dust depletion ( e.g. , savage & sembach 1996 , jenkins 2009 ) .",
    "jenkins ( 2009 ) proposed a method based on multiple elements for assessing the extent of dust depletion and the determination of true ( undepleted ) abundances .",
    "we now attempt to determine the level of dust depletion in the @xmath72 sub - dla toward q1202 + 3235 applying the prescription of jenkins ( 2009 ) to element abundances available from our data , as described in a study of absorbers from the eso uves advanced data products quasar sample ( quiret et al .",

    "the dotted line shows the buckley - james regression fit to the data .",

    "the intrinsic metallicity thus inferred is consistent with the metallicity we obtain from o ( -2.00 @xmath3 0.12 ) .",
    "the @xmath108 value is a little higher than the average value of @xmath110 for the larger sub - dla sample from quiret et al .",
    "this suggests that the sub - dla at @xmath72 toward q1202 + 3235 may be somewhat more dusty than the typical lower redshift sub - dlas , perhaps further supporting the possibility that the depletion levels may be higher at @xmath72 . for reference ,",
    "representative @xmath108 values are -0.1 for the warm ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way , 0.1 for the warm neutral medium , and 0.4 for the cold neutral medium ( draine 2011 ) .",
    "the @xmath72 sub - dla toward q1202 + 3235 may be more similar to the warm ionized ism , which is not entirely surprising .",
    "( we point out that quiret et al .",
    "2016 find the typical @xmath108 value for dlas to be even more negative @xmath111 , again suggesting warm ionized gas and lower dust content compared to the milky way ism . )",
    "it would be interesting to obtain @xmath108 values for the high-@xmath1 dlas as well .",
    "more detections of undepleted elements in high-@xmath1 dlas are needed for this purpose , since none of the high-@xmath1 dlas observed so far have enough such detections to permit determination of @xmath108 .",
    "another important indicator of the absorber properties can be obtained from the velocity structure of the absorption lines .",
    "a correlation between the gas velocity dispersion and metallicity has been observed for both dlas and sub - dlas ( e.g. , ledoux et al .",
    "2006 ; meiring et al . 2007 ;",
    "som et al .",
    "if the velocity dispersion is determined primarily by the mass of the host galaxy , the velocity - metallicity correlation may indicate a mass - metallicity relation .",
    "alternately , the velocity dispersion may be determined primarily by turbulent motions , outflows , or inflows of gas .",
    "the velocity - metallicity relation appears to be different for dlas and sub - dlas ( som et al .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare the gas kinematics of the @xmath72 sub - dla studied here with that for other sub - dlas and for dlas .",
    "the velocity width @xmath112 is determined as the velocity range within which 90% of the integrated optical depth is contained .",
    "the top two panels of fig . [ dv ]",
    "show the measurements of @xmath112 for si ii @xmath38 1526 and o i @xmath38 1302 , based on our observations . despite the difference in the strengths of the lines , the velocity dispersions inferred from their observations are quite similar , i.e. , 88.42 km s@xmath89 for si ii @xmath38 1526 and 85.81 km s@xmath89 for o i @xmath38 1302 .",
    "quiret et al .",
    "( 2016 ) recently advocated using the theoretical voigt profile fit without convolution with the instrumental profile instead of the actual data for calculating @xmath112 .",
    "the idea is to reduce the sensitivity of the measurement to instrumental resolution and to the presence of noise or saturation in the data .",
    "this latter approach , illustrated in the bottom two panels of fig .",
    "[ dv ] , gives @xmath112 of 84.49 and 74.04 km s@xmath89 , respectively , for the si ii @xmath38 1526 and o i @xmath38 1302 lines .",
    "since the si  ii @xmath38 1526 line is less saturated , we adopt its @xmath112 as the velocity dispersion for this system .    given this velocity dispersion ,",
    "this absorber lies far below the metallicity - velocity relation observed for lower redshift sub - dlas .",
    "for example , som et al . (",
    "2015 ) obtain [ x / h ] = ( @xmath113 ) log @xmath114 @xmath115 ) for lower redshift sub - dlas . as per this relation",
    ", one would expect the @xmath72 sub - dla toward q1202 + 3235 to have a metallicity of @xmath116 dex , far above the observed value of @xmath117 dex . for dlas , som et al .",
    "( 2015 ) estimate [ x / h ] = ( @xmath118 ) log @xmath114 @xmath119 ) . even as per this relation , an absorber with a velocity dispersion of 84.49 km s@xmath89 would be expected to have a metallicity of -1.13 @xmath71 dex .",
    "the absorber toward q1202 + 3235 thus appears to lie closer to the velocity - metallicity relation for dlas than that for sub - dlas , and in fact , lies substantially below even the dla relation .",
    "we do note again , however , that the bulk of the o i absorption in this absorber is limited to a much narrower velocity range .",
    "the si ii and c ii absorption is spread more uniformly .",
    "this difference may arise from a difference in abundances and/or ionization in the higher velocity , possibly outflowing gas .",
    "we also note that the velocity dispersion of the si ii gas in this absorber is much larger than the velocity dispersion measured for the very metal - poor dlas by cooke et al .",
    "2015 ( even after accounting for their use of the innermost 68 @xmath120 rather than the innermost 90 @xmath120 of the optical depth to define the velocity dispersion ) .",
    "cooke et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have suggested that the very metal - poor dlas arise in galaxies with low halo masses .",
    "it appears that the @xmath72 sub - dla studied here may be larger in halo mass . on the other hand ,",
    "if the higher velocity component represents outflowing gas , and the velocity dispersion of the main absorber is in fact smaller , the implied halo mass could be smaller .",
    "we have studied the chemical composition and kinematics of a sub - dla at @xmath72 , providing the first reliable measurement of element abundances based on detections of undepleted elements in a quasar sub - dla at @xmath26 .",
    "this absorber is substantially metal - poor ( [ o / h]= @xmath121 ) , @xmath4 4 @xmath5 lower than the expectations from the @xmath122 sub - dlas .",
    "it has unusual relative abundance patterns , e.g. , an overall under - abundance , relative to the solar ratio , of si and c compared to o by factors of @xmath883.2 and @xmath881.8 , respectively .",
    "the relative abundance pattern is also distinct from the typical pattern seen in the vmp dlas .",
    "furthermore , there appears to be a substantial variation in the c / o and si / o ratios between different velocity components .",
    "indeed , the component offset by @xmath123 km s@xmath89 from the dominant component appears to have significant enhancement of c and si relative to o. it is possible that this higher - velocity gas traces an outflow enriched by early stars .",
    "the main component , deficient in c and si relative to o , may be enriched by a different stellar population , or may be reflecting a higher level of dust depletion . with a gas velocity dispersion of @xmath8884 km",
    "s@xmath89 , this absorber lies closer to the velocity - metallicity trend observed for dlas than that for sub - dlas , and in fact lies substantially below even the dla relation .",
    "the possibility of higher si depletion in this @xmath72 absorber also suggests that the sudden metallicity drop reported in the dla metallicity at @xmath23 could perhaps be caused in part by higher dust depletion levels . in any case , the low [ si / o ] ratio in this absorber underscores the need to obtain measurements of undepleted or weakly depleted elements such as o in other dlas and sub - dlas at these high redshifts .    our results ,",
    "if confirmed by studies of other sub - dlas at similar redshifts , would suggest that sub - dla metallicity may have built up rapidly between @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the metal - poor nature of this absorber and its location in the velocity - metallicity plane also suggest that the dla and sub - dla absorber populations may have been more similar at high redshifts .",
    "indeed , an absorber that is a sub - dla at low redshift could have been a dla at high redshift .",
    "for example , if a subset of dlas experienced more rapid star formation ( and hence neutral gas consumption ) compared to the remaining dla population , they could later manifest themselves as the less gas - rich , but more metal - enriched sub - dlas .",
    "a systematic study of undepleted elements in more high-@xmath1 dlas and sub - dlas is essential to understand whether the two populations were indeed similar in the past , and when they started differentiating from each other",
    ". it would be fascinating to examine , for example , whether this differentiation was linked to the emergence of the dichotomy between early - type and late - type galaxies .",
    "the evolution of interstellar element abundances is governed by the history of star formation and the distribution of these elements in interstellar space .",
    "the cosmic star formation history has been measured out to @xmath124 ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2015 and references therein )",
    ". it will therefore be very interesting to examine how the metal evolution implied by this cosmic star formation history compares with the observations of high-@xmath1 dlas and sub - dlas .",
    "the relative abundances of elements in high-@xmath1 dlas and sub - dlas will also offer excellent constraints on metal and dust production by population iii and early population ii stars .",
    "for example , it will be interesting to examine whether the low [ si / o ] seen in the @xmath72 absorber toward q1202 + 3235 was common at that epoch .",
    "population iii nucleosynthesis models predict substantial differences between relative abundances such as [ si / o ] at high redshifts for different population iii initial mass functions ( imfs ) and different halo masses .",
    "[ si / o ] is more constraining than [ c / fe ] because the si yield varies more with the imf , due to the efficiency of si production in massive stars as a result of o burning .",
    "for example , kulkarni et al . ( 2013 ) predict a substantial under - abundance of si relative to o at @xmath125 for a population iii imf extending over 35 - 100 @xmath94 stellar mass range . for that imf",
    ", a [ si / o ] ratio comparable to that seen in the sub - dla studied here would be expected for a @xmath126 @xmath94 halo at @xmath125 . on the other hand ,",
    "kulkarni et al . ( 2013 ) predict a substantial overabundance of si relative to o for a population iii imf extending over the 100 - 260 @xmath94 range .",
    "the differences seen in the si / o ratios between the velocity components of the @xmath72 sub - dla toward q1202 + 3235 thus could be indicative of spatial variations in the population iii imf .",
    "any insights obtained into the population iii imf from more relative abundance studies in high-@xmath1 dlas and sub - dlas would also help to quantify the role played by population iii stars in the reionization of the intergalactic medium .",
