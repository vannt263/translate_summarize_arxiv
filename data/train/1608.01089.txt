    "compact stars , in minutes or hours after their birth rapidly cool down to temperatures of @xmath0 from upper bounds of @xmath1 .",
    "this cooling process is performed by the neutrinos which are transported to the surface and is essentially determined by the emissivity of neutrinos produced in direct reactions @xcite .",
    "the matter density in the core of the neutron stars could well exceed upto a few times the nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "thus , in this context , we can expect comparable proportions of up , down and strange quarks @xcite which are quite truly the ground state of qcd at finite baryon density . in addition , at such high matter densities , the constituents of matter are relativistic which compells one to describe such matter in the framework of non- fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior .",
    "the recently discovered phenomenon of nfl behaviour relates itself to the modified quark dispersion relation for excitations close to the fermi surface , finds important application in this realm of phase space .",
    "it has been shown that the nfl corrections to the quark self - energy enhance the neutrino emissivity of ungapped quark matter which may exist in the core of neutron stars@xcite . like emissivity , in dense",
    "quark matter , the neutrino mean free path(mfp ) also receives significant nfl corrections as has been demonstrated in @xcite . in many calculations ,",
    "such corrections appear in the modification of the phase space giving rise to appreciable contributions to the well known fermi liquid ( fl ) terms .",
    "knowledge of the neutrino emissivity showing nfl behavior from quark cores or essentially the neutrino mean free path ( mfp ) in compact stars which is an essential pre - requisite for a comprehensive understanding of a host of interesting phenomena such as the cooling of the star . in view of these contemporary investigations ,",
    "we here plan to present the neutrino mfp and corresponding emissivity in normal degenerate quark matter beyond leading logarithmic order and compare it with the lo results .",
    "leading order ( lo ) refers to the anomalous logarithmic term @xmath2 that occurs as the first term in the non - fermi liquid contribution to the fermion self energy .",
    "the quantities such as mfp and emissivity of neutrinos calculated with this term is called the lo corrections .",
    "next to leading order ( nlo ) terms include all other terms beyond the lo that contain the fractional powers of @xmath3 and up to the @xmath4 .",
    "quantities calculated with this correction are labeled as nlo corrections @xcite . knowing the specific heat of dense quark matter upto the order concerned , we investigate the cooling behaviour of the neutron star with dense quark core . the important theoretical input required for the study of the emissivity and cooling is the neutrino mfp from such quark cores . in all these cases , the correction at the lo has been seen to involve @xmath5 term which has been dubbed as anomalous corrections in many of the recent literatures @xcite . similar behavior has also been reported while investigating quantities like drag , diffusion coefficients and thermal relaxation time of electrons for relativistic degenerate plasmas @xcite .",
    "in fact , the specific heat of the qm is also modified due to such corrections beyond the fl order . in this review",
    ", we will present the specific heat of degenerate quark matter which receives significant correction due to the presence of the high external magnetic field while including the nfl corrections .",
    "such high magnetic fields are present a the core of the ns .",
    "thus , the inclusion of the magnetic field in the specific heat in the case of interacting plasma and its effect on the kick velocity of the ns is studied in detail .",
    "the mechanism for the generation of such phenomenal kicks is the polarisation of the electrons leading to neutrino emission in a preferred direction .",
    "the magnetic field strength required has to be equal to or greater than @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass and charge of the electron .",
    "this leads to the formation of the neutrino and anti - neutrino emission cones which give rise to polarised neutrino emission opposite to the direction of the magnetic field producing the recoil velocity .",
    "we have used the electron polarisation for different conditions of magnetic field and kick velocities has been studied recently by sagert et .",
    "al.@xcite where the dependence of the kick velocity with the quark phase temperature and radius of the star with varying quark chemical potentials have been investigated .",
    "this review is based upon the recent works @xcite where the authors have explored various aspects of the neutrino dynamics in reactions involving ultra - degenerate quark matter . in this review ,",
    "we discuss the mean free path of the neutrinos and emissivity of neutrinos from neutron star in section a and b respectively .",
    "in addition , we will present results to see how the cooling is affected when one considers the anomalous corrections into the calculable physical quantities . in section b. in the succeeding section",
    ", we will extend this formalism and introduce the effect of the external magnetic field to calculate the specific heat capacity of degenerate quark matter .",
    "this quantity directly influences the kick velocity of pulsars ( i.e. rapidly rotating neutron stars ) which arises due to asymmetric neutrino emission .",
    "finally , we will present the results and conclude in section d.        the dominant contribution to the emission of neutrinos is given by the quark analog of @xmath9 decay and the electron capture reaction producing neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the degenerate neutrinos refer to the case where the neutrino chemical potential ( @xmath10 ) is much larger than the temperature . d+_eu+e^- [ dir ] u+e^-d+_e .",
    "[ inv ] the corresponding mean free paths are denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 which are subsequently combined to obtain the total mean free path of the neutrinos , = +    the mfp of the neutrinos is related to the total interaction rate due to neutrino emission which is averaged over the initial quark spins and eventually summed over the final state phase space and spins .",
    "it is given by @xcite , [ mfp01 ] = & & ( 2)^4 ^ 4(p_d + p_-p_u -p_e ) + & & |m|^2 \\{n(p_d)[1-n(p_u)][1-n(p_e ) ] + n(p_u)n(p_e)[1-n(p_d ) ] } , where , @xmath13 is the spin and color degeneracy , taken as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the energy , momentum and distribution function for the corresponding particle . the squared invariant amplitude @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 .",
    "here @xmath20 is the weak coupling constant .",
    "the interaction involving strange quark is cabibbo suppressed due to which the neutrino emission from strange quark matter can be neglected .",
    "we now consider the case of degenerate neutrinos _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath21 .",
    "so in this case both the direct eq.([dir ] ) and inverse eq.([inv ] ) processes are relevant .",
    "therefore , the @xmath9 equilibrium condition becomes @xmath22 .",
    "now , the momentum integration , @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be calculated as , d^3p_d=2pdpd ; d^3p_u=2de_edwhere we define @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 can be evaluated from the modified dispersion relation as follows @xcite , = ( 1- ) [ dpdo ] we use the explicit form of the real part of the quark self energy in the ultradegenerate limit as found in refs.(@xcite ) . neglecting the quark - quark interactions ,",

    "to arrive at the fermi - liquid result , one can use the free dispersion relation to arrive at @xcite , [ mfp_cond1 ] |_fl = g_f^2 ^ 2_c .",
    "quarks and electrons are considered to be massless in this framework , the chemical equilibrium condition gives @xmath27 , which we use to derive eq.([mfp_cond1 ] ) .",

    "proceeding in a similar way , we obtain @xcite ,     @xmath30 is the number density of quark of flavor i and @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 is defined in @xcite where @xmath33 if @xmath34 and @xmath35 if @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the vector and axial vector coupling constants which are given in detail in table ( ii ) of @xcite . the contributions from the fermi liquid(fl ) , lo and nlo are added to obtain the mfp of the neutrinos .",
    "we now derive mfp for nondegenerate neutrinos _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath39 beyond the fermi - liquid contribution . for nondegenerate",
    "neutrinos the inverse process ( [ inv ] ) is not considered as for untrapped case , the reverse reaction is assumed to be zero .",
    "hence , we neglect the second term in the curly braces of eq.([mfp01])@xcite . including the strong interactions between the quarks results in a nonvanishing squared matrix amplitude . the neutrino momentum in energy conserving relation due to the thermal production of the neutrinos",
    "can safely be neglected @xcite .",
    "the fermi liquid case , lo and nlo are given as @xcite , [ mfp03 ] |_fl&=&g_f^2 ^ 2_c  _ d  _ u  _ e  ; |_log_f^2 ^ 2_c_e(g)^2 ( ) ; |_nlo&&g_f^2 ^ 2_c^2_ewhere the constants are evaluated in @xcite .",
    "similarly , for the scattering of nondegenerate neutrinos in quark matter with appropriate phase space corrections we obtain @xcite , [ mfp_scnd ] |_fl&=&n_q_ig_f^2 ;     here , it has been assumed @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the total mfp for non - degenerate neutrinos is obtained by summing up the contributions from the absorption and scattering parts to get the expression of the mfp of the non - degenerate neutrinos up to the nlo terms .      in this section ,",
    "we focus on the calculation of the neutrino emissivity from the neutrino mfp .",
    "the total emissivity of the non - degenerate neutrinos is obtained by multiplying the neutrino energy with the inverse of the mfp with appropriate factors and integrated over the neutrino momentum given by , = e_. the total nfl correction can be obtained as , - _ 0 = _ lo + _ nlo where , _ 0",

    "one power of @xmath3 from the energy conserving @xmath43 function is cancelled by a power from the emitted neutrino energy . for excitations lying close to the fermi surface ,",
    "the angular integrals provide no temperature dependence .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned quark direct process , there are contributions from other processes in different domain of density and momentum of the constitutent particles . as for example",
    ", the neutrino emissivity from modified quark urca process is given as @xcite , ^qurca~_c^2 g_f^2 cos^2_c p_f(q)(k_b t)^8 in lower densities , dominant neutrino emission mechanisms are the one - nucleon processes e.g. , @xmath44 , called nucleon direct urca ( du ) reactions .",
    "their emissivity is@xcite , ^du~10",
    "^ 27t_9 ^ 6(n / n_0)^2/3(n -n_c^du ) erg/ cm^3 s where @xmath45 is the nucleon density measured in units of the nuclear matter saturation density @xmath46 .",
    "the du processes are operative only when the proton fraction exceeds a critical value of 1114% .",
    "another similar process of quite interest is the two nucleon interactions ( in presence of a bystander particle ) e.g. , @xmath47 , called modified urca processes ( mu ) with the emissivity @xcite , ^mu~10 ^ 21t_9 ^ 8(n / n_0)^2/3 erg / cm^3 s however , other different processes , the nuclear bremstrahlung reactions , such as @xmath48 ( nb ) , @xmath49 ( npb ) and @xmath50 ( pb ) have an order of magnitude smaller emission rates than the mu processes .",
    "in addition , quark matter at asymptotically high density is in the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase  @xcite of color superconductivity ( csc ) .",
    "the csc phases at moderate density are still unclear due to the complicated non - perturbative effect .",
    "various candidates have been proposed , such as two flavor csc ( 2sc )  @xcite , gapless 2sc  @xcite , gapless cfl ( gcfl )  @xcite , crystalline csc  @xcite , and spin-1 csc  @xcite .",
    "neutrino emission from csc quark matter is exponentially suppressed at low temperature , if the quasi - particle spectra are fully gapped  @xcite .",
    "similar to nuclear matter , the pair breaking and recombination effect results in an emissivity of @xmath51 at temperature close to @xmath52  @xcite .",

    "this agrees well with the high density @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the nuclear matter saturation density ) at the core .",
    "we have taken @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in left panel of fig.([figdn ] ) we note that there is a considerable decrease in mfp of degenerate neutrinos due to nlo corrections over the fermi liquid result . in right panel of fig.([figdn ] ) lo correction is compared with the nlo correction and it is seen that the mfp with nlo correction is reduced marginally as compared to lo correction .",
    "similar features have been observed in case of the mfp of non - degenerate neutrinos as displayed in fig.([figndn ] ) .",
    "this modest difference in the mfp between nfl lo and nlo corrections also leads to marginal difference in the emissivity for the two cases .",

    "these small reductions are reflected in the marginally enhanced emissivity of the non - degenerate neutrinos which has been shown in left panel of fig.([figecv ] ) .",
    "we note that there is a modest increase in the emissivity of the neutrinos .",
    "the complicated cooling equation has to be solved numerically as shown in fig.([figecv ] ) ( right panel ) .",
    "the temperature of the neutron star with a quark matter core shows a dependency with time . to analyse the cooling of the star @xcite",
    ", the specific heat capacity of the quark matter core needs to be taken into consideration along with the emissivity via the cooling process @xcite .",
    "we have considered the nfl contribution to the specific heat capacity to compute our results .",
    "we observe that the cooling of neutron star is marginally faster in case of nfl ( nlo ) as compared to the fermi liquid result ( shown in fig.([figcool ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , it is found that the cooling process from the quark core is much faster than the case where the nuclear matter is considered to be present at the core .",
    "this influence of magnetic interaction has a significant effect on the cooling behavior of the neutron star , which in the present case , is modified due to incorporation of the nfl contribution beyond lo .",
    "this leads to a marginally faster cooling of the neutron star due to neutrino emission urca processes and the quark neutrino scattering reaction .",
    "the amount of pulsar acceleration depends on the polarisation of the electron spin and the momenta .",
    "the kick velocity can be written as @xcite , @xmath61 where the polarisation fraction of the electrons has been denoted by @xmath62 and the neutrino emissivity by @xmath63 . using the cooling equation , @xmath64 one can rewrite eq.([diffv ] ) in terms of the specific heat ( @xmath65 ) of the quark matter core .",
    "the influence of the exterior magnetic field on the specific heat of the quark matter in addition to the nfl effect can be explored in an interesting way . in the presence of a constant external magnetic field ( b ) along the z axis",

    "the nlo correction is @xcite , v|_nlo^b&&()()^2()^3 + & & ( c_f_s ) [ vbnlo ] the long range magnetic interactions are responsible for the anomalous @xmath71 term in the expressions of the pulsar kick velocity .    for the case of cold neutron stars ,",
    "the spin polarisation of electrons is given by @xcite , @xcite , @xmath72 where the critical value of the magnetic field is taken to be @xmath73 to landau quantize the electrons .",
    "the second case arises when the strength of the magnetic field is chosen to be much larger than the temperature , the chemical potential and the electron mass ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the electron polarisation is given as @xcite , @xmath75 for the case of large magnetic field , the kick velocity can not be solved analytically . the net contribution to the pulsar kick velocity upto nlo is obtained by the sum of the fermi liquid result and the non - fermi liquid correction upto nlo :",
    "v_total^b = v|_fl^b+v|_lo^b+v|_nlo^b [ vtotal ] with these results , an estimation of the quark phase radius of the ns with the temperature of the quark matter in the core is presented . in fig.([figkickvel ] ) , for the case of highly polarised electrons , a comparison between fl , lo and nlo corrections to the kick velocity is shown in the extreme left panel .",
    "the middle panel shows an exactly similar behavior with inclusion of the magnetic field on the specific heat capacity of quarks . in the figure at extreme right ,",
    "similar behavior for nfl cases are observed when the electrons are partially polarised for low magnetic fields .",
    "it is observed that the pulsar kick velocity receives significant contribution from the logarithmic corrections at the lo in comparison to the fl result .",
    "the results are computed with lo and nlo corrections to include plasma or quasiparticle effects which are anomalous ( nfl ) effects . in addition",
    ", comparison has been made between the nfl lo and nlo contributions to the kick velocity with the fl case .",
    "it is seen that the nfl lo corrections are significant while calculating the radius - temperature relationship as seen in fig.([figkickvel ] ) .",
    "the anomalous corrections introduced to the pulsar kick velocity due to the nfl ( lo ) behavior is responsible for the appreciable increment of the kick velocity for a particular value of temperature found in the ns core .",
    "however , for all the cases , moderate change in the r - t relationship has been observed for the nlo correction with respect to the lo case .",
    "the prime objective of the present review is to unravel the subtleties of the application of the in - medium modified propagators to describe the collective excitations of quasiparticles in relativistic dense plasma involving neutrinos . in the domain of phase space of qcd matter , in the astrophysical realm",
    ", physical quantities of the neutrinos from various processes have been presented .",
    "we found the mfp of both degenerate and non - degenerate neutrinos involving terms which have fractional powers in @xmath76 at higher orders ; obtained using the perturbation theory and the nfl phenomenon as discussed above .",
    "in addition , we have also calculated the emissivity of neutrinos and examined nlo corrections over nfl lo and the simple fl case .",
    "finally , we have examined the cooling behavior of the neutron star involving nlo correction to the emissivity of neutrinos .",
    "we have found that although there is a modest correction to the quantities like mfp and emissivity of neutrinos over lo and fl case , there is a marginal alteration in the cooling behavior due to such nfl corrections .",
    "the extension of the nfl phenomena to the study of pulsar kick velocities show that it receives significant contribution from the logarithmic corrections .",
    "further , incorporation of the modified quark dispersion relations up to next - to - leading order to include the anomalous nfl / quasiparticle effects into the kick velocity has been done .",
    "in addition , we have studied the effect of external magnetic field on the specific heat capacity of quarks which modifies the pulsar kick velocity .",
    "the main mechanism in our study has been asymmetric neutrino emission leading to the kicks which arises due to the strong magnetic field which can align the electron spin opposite to the magnetic field direction .",
    "thus , we have taken into account the contribution from electron polarization fractions for different field strengths . in our study",
    ", we have seen that the presence of the logarithmic term and the fractional powers which are signatures of the weaker dynamical screening ( as mentioned previously ) as well as external magnetic field considerably enhances the kick velocity of the neutron star .",
    "these studies provide a starting point to the study of the interplay of strong magnetic fields @xcite and physical quantities of neutrinos which can have significant impact in the context of interesting astrophysical entities such as neutron stars .",
