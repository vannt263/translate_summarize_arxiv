    "conventional methods like atomic beam sources ( abs ) , appropriate for the production of polarized protons and heavy ions can not be applied , since antiprotons annihilate with matter . so far",

    "filtering is practically non  existent .",
    "the ad  ring at cern is a unique facility at which stored antiprotons in the appropriate energy range are available and whose characteristics meet the requirements for the first ever antiproton polarization buildup studies . therefore , it is of highest priority in the quest for polarized antiprotons to make use of this opportunity , and to perform spin  filtering experiments using stored antiprotons at the ad  ring of cern . in preparation for the experiment at the ad , a number of dedicated spin  filtering experiments will be carried out with protons at the cooler synchrotron cosy at jlich , germany in order to commission the needed equipment , and to gain additional understanding of the accelerator physics aspects of the project .",

    "the qcd physics potential of experiments with high energy polarized antiprotons is enormous , yet hitherto high luminosity experiments with polarized antiprotons have been impossible . the situation could change dramatically with the demonstration of spin filtering and storing of polarized antiprotons , and the implementation of a double  polarized high ",

    "proton collider .",
    "the list of fundamental physics issues for such a collider includes the determination of transversity , the quark transverse polarization inside a transversely polarized proton , the last leading twist missing piece of the qcd description of the partonic structure of the nucleon . it can be directly measured only via double  polarized antiproton ",
    "proton drell  yan production . without measurements of the transversity",
    ", the spin tomography of the proton would be ever incomplete .",
    "other items of great importance for the qcd description of the proton include the phase of the timelike form factors of the proton and hard antiproton  proton scattering .",
    "such an ambitious physics program has been formulated by the pax collaboration ( polarized antiproton experiment ) and a technical proposal @xcite has recently been submitted to the fair project . the uniqueness and the strong scientific merits of the pax proposal",
    "have been well received @xcite , and there is an urgency to convincingly demonstrate experimentally that a high degree of antiproton polarization could be reached with a dedicated apr  @xcite .",
    "when some 25 years ago , intense antiproton beams became a new tool in nuclear and particle physics , there was an immediate demand to polarize these antiprotons . at the time",
    ", there was no shortage of rough ideas on how this might be accomplished  @xcite , but , up to now , the only polarized antiprotons available for use were in a secondary beam facility , which made use of the decay of hyperons  @xcite , and which was operating at fermilab in the 1990 s .",
    "only a few of the early ideas to polarize antiprotons are still considered today  @xcite , and they all aim at polarizing an ensemble of antiprotons that is orbiting in a storage ring .",
    "spin@xmath31 particles have two possible spin projections . polarizing a beam of such particles",
    "could be accomplished by identifying and selectively discarding the particles in one of the two states .",
    "the separation of the spin states could be accomplished via the interaction of the magnetic moments with external fields ( known as ` stern - gerlach effect ' ) , or via the spin dependence of a nuclear reaction ( known as ` spin filtering ' ) .",
    "while there is doubt that the former scheme is feasible , the second method has actually been subjected to a successful experimental test  @xcite .",
    "a spin@xmath31 beam could also be polarized if particles in one spin state would be moved into the other state ( by ` spin flipping ' ) .",
    "the advantage over the spin filter method is that the precious stored beam is conserved by this process .",
    "some time ago it was suggested that such a spin flip may be induced by an interaction of the stored beam with polarized electrons .",
    "recently , the mainz group  @xcite calculated a very large spin ",
    "flip probability in electron ",
    "proton scattering at low energy ( around 1 ev center  of  mass energy ) .",
    "the predicted cross sections were so large that it would have become possible to polarize stored antiprotons by spin flip , using a co  moving beam of polarized positrons  @xcite even at the low intensities at which such a beam is currently available . however a competing calculation  @xcite disagreed with the estimate of the mainz group by 16 orders of magnitude and came to the conclusion that spin flip in hadron ",
    "lepton scattering is not a viable mechanism to polarize a stored beam .",
    "the discrepancy between the two theoretical estimates was resolved by a very recent , dedicated experiment at cosy in which the depolarization of a stored , polarized proton beam scattering from unpolarized electrons , was measured  @xcite .",
    "this experiment establishes an upper limit for the spin ",
    "flip cross section that clearly rules out the estimate by the mainz group  @xcite , and for the time being the prospect of using spin flip to polarize a stored beam , at least until a better idea provides new hope .",
    "since the completion of the experiment , the calculations of the mainz group have been withdrawn  @xcite .",
    "thus , at this time , spin filtering is the only known method that stands a reasonable chance of succeeding in the production of a stored beam of polarized antiprotons .",
    "that a stored beam can be polarized by spin filtering has been demonstrated in the filtex experiment at tsr , heidelberg  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "a 23mev , stored proton beam was passing through an internal transversely polarized hydrogen gas target with a thickness of @xmath32 atoms/@xmath33 .",
    "the polarization buildup of the beam as a function of filter time @xmath34 can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath35 provided that the effect of depolarizing resonances can be neglected on a time scale of @xmath36 . here",
    ", @xmath36 is the polarizing time constant .",
    "the induced beam polarization is parallel to the target polarization . in filtex , a polarization buildup rate of @xmath37 has been observed .",
    "the polarization buildup has been interpreted in terms of the known @xmath38 spin ",
    "dependent interaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it can be shown that the time constants for transverse ( @xmath39 ) or longitudinal ( @xmath40 ) filtering are given by , respectively @xmath41 here , @xmath25 is the target polarization , @xmath42 is the target thickness in atoms/@xmath33 and @xmath43 is the revolution frequency of the particles in the ring .",
    "the `` filtering cross sections '' @xmath44 and @xmath45 are closely related to the spin  dependent total cross sections , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - spin - dep ] ) .",
    "the difference arises because antiprotons that scatter at a sufficiently small angle remain in the ring .",
    "this is the case for scattering events with @xmath46 less than the acceptance angle @xmath47 of the machine downstream of the target .    in order to extract both spin  dependent total cross sections @xmath1 and @xmath2 from the observed time constants [ eq .  (",
    "[ eq : tau ] ) ] , a measurement with transverse and longitudinal target ( and therefore beam ) polarization is required .",
    "the latter involves the operation of a siberian snake in the ad .",
    "in addition , the acceptance angle @xmath47 has to be known ( typically 10  20  mrad , see sec .",
    "[ sec : acceptance - lifetime ] ) , because the spin ",
    "dependent cross sections @xmath44 and @xmath45 depend on @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , coulomb  nuclear interference at extreme forward angles @xmath49 must be taken into account . for protons , where the interaction is purely elastic , this is accomplished using the existing @xmath50 scattering databases said  @xcite and nijmegen  @xcite .",
    "for antiprotons such a data base does not exist yet , and since both elastic scattering and all annihilation channels contribute , the corrected cross sections need to be calculated within a specific model .",
    "recently , a calculation was published of the spin ",
    "dependent cross sections in @xmath0 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 at intermediate energy , based on @xmath53 interaction models developed by the jlich group  @xcite .",
    "while the unpolarized total cross sections reproduce the data quite well , the predicted spin  dependence depends strongly on the interaction model chosen , emphasizing the need for empirical information .",
    "it was also found that shorter buildup time constants might be achieved using a polarized deuterium target .",
    "the polarized target to be installed at the ad would be capable of providing polarized deuterium , so this option will be seriously considered .",
    "in addition to a test of the feasibility of polarizing antiprotons by filtering , the proposed ad experiment will provide a measurement of the spin ",
    "dependent cross sections @xmath1 and @xmath2 as a function of energy from 50 to 450  mev .",
    "first information will be obtained on the spin  dependence of the antiproton  proton and the antiproton ",
    "deuteron interaction .",
    "these data will represent a crucial test of current and emerging theoretical models .",
    "the stored beam intensity decreases with time because of reactions and scattering outside the machine acceptance .",
    "most of these events occur in the internal target .",
    "the beam lifetime depends thus on the target thickness . for a given production rate of polarized atoms ,",
    "the target thickness depends on the diameter of the storage cell .",
    "the opening in the storage cell , in turn , affects the machine acceptance , and one is faced with an optimization problem .",
    "possible optimization criteria are the polarization buildup rate , the beam remaining after filtering , or the statistical accuracy of a polarization measurement .        as an example , the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : thetavsd ] shows the dependence of the acceptance angle in the ad as a function of the diameter of a storage cell at the pax target .",
    "this relation uses a machine acceptance of @xmath54   @xmath55 m and @xmath56  @xmath55 m and a @xmath57 beam emittance of 1  @xmath55 m in both planes  @xcite .",
    "the right panel shows predicted beam lifetimes for three different cell diameters .",
    "it is assumed that the beam losses occur entirely in the target , taking into account rutherford scattering and the @xmath0 total cross section .      at present",
    ", the ad provides about @xmath58 stored antiprotons .",
    "we anticipate that by the development of stacking techniques one may be able to increase this number by about a factor of five  @xcite . with about @xmath59 stored antiprotons ,",
    "a luminosity of @xmath60 @xmath61  s@xmath62 atoms/@xmath33 @xmath63  @xmath7s@xmath8 will be achievable .",
    "keeping in mind that after spin filtering for a few beam lifetimes a substantial remaining beam intensity is needed in order to measure the beam polarization , it is fairly important to dedicate some development effort towards increasing the number of antiprotons stored in the ad .",
    "obviously , other experiments at the ad would also benefit from such a development .",
    "the spin tune is the number of rotations of the magnetic moment of a particle during one turn around the ring .",
    "depolarizing resonances arise when the horizontal and vertical tune , the orbit frequency and the synchrotron frequency , or combinations thereof , are related in a simple way to the spin tune . as an example ,",
    "an ` intrinsic ' resonance occurs when the ( e.g. ) horizontal tune and the spin tune are an integer multiple of each other .",
    "more complicated resonance conditions are possible and lead to ( usually weaker ) resonances . near a resonance ,",
    "the spin motions of individual particles start to differ , and the beam depolarizes .",
    "experimental studies of the polarization lifetime in a storage ring have been carried out at the indiana cooler  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the polarization lifetime increases rapidly with distance from the resonance , and quickly becomes so long as to be difficult to measure .",
    "thus , for the cooler experiments it was sufficient to avoid the immediate proximity to any low - order resonance .    for experiments involving long filtering times ,",
    "the conditions on the preservation of polarization are more stringent and higher  order resonances could become an issue .",
    "we anticipate that in preparation for the experiments at the ad a careful study of depolarizing resonances will be needed , in order to guarantee that the polarization lifetime is much longer than the buildup time .",
    "in this section we present an estimate of the anticipated polarization buildup by filtering . for the spin ",
    "dependent @xmath0 interaction we are using two different models ( models `` a '' and `` d '' of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the solid lines are calculated for different cell diameters , and correspond to the curves in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : predictedpol ] ; the dashed line is for the theoretical acceptance angle limit of 25 mrad .",
    "the primary quantity measured in this experiment is the polarization of the stored beam .",
    "vertical beam polarization is measured by observing the left ",
    "right @xmath0 scattering asymmetry .",
    "this asymmetry is given by the product of the beam polarization and the analyzing power .",
    "the @xmath64 analyzing power , of course , has never been measured but is related to the @xmath65 analyzing power by cpt symmetry . in our energy range , angular distributions of the @xmath65 analyzing power have been measured at lear by experiment ps172",
    "@xcite at fifteen momenta , ranging from 497 to 1550 mev / c , and by experiment ps198 at 439 , 544 , and 697  mev / c  @xcite .",
    "most of the data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbarpay ] .",
    "it is important to realize that our experiment generates its own @xmath65 analyzing powers , since , at least during the early part of the filtering process , the ( still ) unpolarized antiproton beam is interacting with a hydrogen target of known , large polarization .    in order to avoid contributions from other spin observables",
    ", it is assumed that during the polarization measurement the target is unpolarized .",
    "this is easily achieved by averaging data taken with spin up and down , or by injection of unpolarized h@xmath66 into the cell ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : ugfs ] ) .",
    "longitudinal beam polarization could only be directly measured when the spin ",
    "correlation coefficients were known .",
    "thus , in this case , before measuring the beam polarization , the spin alignment axis at the target must be turned from longitudinal to vertical by adiabatically turning off the siberian snake .",
    "it is interesting to note that with the polarized internal target , a determination of the longitudinal spin correlation coefficient @xmath67 in elastic @xmath68 scattering becomes possible .",
    "once this parameter is established , the longitudinal beam polarization could be determined directly .",
    "the target polarization will either be measured using known @xmath0 analyzing powers or by the breit",
    " rabi polarimeter that analyzes a fraction of the atomic beam that is generated in the target source ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : tga - brp ] ) .",
    "the target density can be either obtained from the observed deceleration of the stored beam when the electron cooling is switched off , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , or it can be inferred from the measured rates in the polarimeter using the quite well established elastic antiproton  proton differential cross sections , measured at lear  @xcite .",
    "the detector system needed to observe @xmath0 scattering is quite similar to the one that has recently been developed for the anke spectrometer operated at cosy  @xcite .",
    "this system uses microstrip detectors in close proximity to the luminous target volume ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , and also sec .",
    "[ sec : detector ] ) .",
    "at present , the ad of cern is the only place world wide , where the proposed measurements can be performed .",
    "the effort involved is substantial .",
    "although we will perform most of the design and commissioning work outside of cern many aspects in the design require a close collaboration with the cern machine group .",
    "the new components that need to be installed in the ad are described in the following sections .",
    "they shall all be tested and commissioned at the cooler synchrotron cosy in jlich . during these tests we plan to perform dedicated spin  filtering experiments with protons .",
