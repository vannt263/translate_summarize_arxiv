    "quantum technologies are often developed in the qubit paradigm , where the basic carrier of quantum information is a two - level quantum system .",
    "qubits are a natural choice because binary is the language of classical technologies .",
    "however , even here , despite the prevalence of binary , its supremacy is questionable .",
    "indeed , donald knuth has advocated the use of balanced ternary , a 3-state classical logic  @xcite . in the quantum domain ,",
    "qudits offer a state space with a richer structure than their two - level counterparts , and the merits of this for quantum information have been explored in many contexts  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have shown even large @xmath0 quantum systems can be precisely controlled  @xcite .    here",
    "we present a qudit generalisation of a powerful class of quantum error correcting codes , the color codes  @xcite .",
    "along with surface codes  @xcite , they constitute the most successful topological codes . using topology ,",
    "quantum codes have achieved high error thresholds , whilst proving more practical than concatenated codes .",
    "thresholds of qudit surface codes indicate improvements with qudit dimension  @xcite .",
    "qubit color codes have several advantages over qubit surface codes , and we show these features can be transferred over into the qudit setting .    there has been some prior investigation into qudit color codes for prime - power @xmath0  @xcite and color codes based on more general groups  @xcite , although these works were restricted to 2d topologies . in this paper",
    ", we generalize color codes to any qudit dimension @xmath0 and spatial dimensions @xmath1 up to the point where @xmath2 factorial is a multiple of @xmath0 . specifically , given any lattice suitable for constructing qubit color codes",
    ", we show how to use the same lattice to construct a qudit color code . for qubits ,",
    "a non - clifford gate can be implemented in color codes in 3 and higher spatial dimensions transversally , i.e. by a tensor product of local unitary gates , an inherently fault - tolerant procedure  @xcite . to avoid confusion between the spatial dimension of the lattice and the hilbert space dimension of the qudit",
    ", we shall always denote the former by the letter @xmath1 and the latter by the letter @xmath0 .",
    "recently , it has been shown by bravyi and knig  @xcite that a quantum error correcting code in @xmath1 spatial dimensions can support a gate with constant depth from at most the @xmath1th level of the clifford hierarchy .",
    "the fact that color codes can be shown to saturate this bound with transversal gates is a very promising feature , and when combined with gauge fixing techniques  @xcite enables universal quantum computation without the need of magic state distillation  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the qudit clifford group is very different from its qubit counterpart  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we find that 3d color codes also provide transversal non - clifford gates in the qudit case .",
    "recently the color codes were generalized to gauge color codes  @xcite  subsystem codes with many advantageous features  including low weight error detection measurements , universal transversal gates via gauge fixing for @xmath3 , fault - tolerant conversion  @xcite between codes of different spatial dimension  @xcite , and for the @xmath4 case , single shot error correction  @xcite  a robustness to measurement errors without the need for repeated measurements .",
    "we show that the qudit color codes introduced here can also be generalized to gauge color codes .",
    "the main technique which we employ is a bipartition of the vertices in the graph that defines the code into _ starred _ and _ unstarred _ vertices .",
    "we call this the _ star - bipartition _ , to distinguish it from the other important colorings which define the color codes . the commutation properties of the stabilizer and logical operators of the color codes ( and gauge color codes ) in the qubit setting can be reduced to the fact that the pairs of operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 commute .",
    "the star - bipartition we introduce replaces some operators with their complex conjugate with respect to the computational basis of @xmath7 eigenstates .",
    "for example , replacing the above operators with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "crucially , this latter pair of operators does commute for qudits of any dimension , and this becomes the starting point for a generalisation of the color codes from qubits to qudits of any hilbert space dimension @xmath0 and any spatial dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the sharp - eyed reader will note that @xmath10 .",
    "we write the star explicitly on a real matrix here , and throughout , to emphasize symmetry and to simplify notation .",
    "thus we see that as long as a pair of @xmath11- and @xmath7-type stabilizers have in common an equal number of starred qudits , they will commute .",
    "furthermore , the star - bipartition provides a general framework for constructing transversal gates from higher levels of the clifford hierarchy .",
    "while elements of this technique can be seen in earlier work  @xcite , this is the first time that it has been exploited systematically .",
    "the second key technical component of our work is a generalisation of the triorthogonal matrix technique by bravyi and haah  @xcite .",

    "stabilizers_. the stabilizer group defines an error correcting code with codewords corresponding to states @xmath28 that are stabilized by the stabilizers , i.e. @xmath29 for all @xmath30 .",
    "the logical operators correspond to the set of operators that commute with @xmath31 but are not contained in it . a pair of logical operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath18-commute with each other and hence encode one qudit .",
    "gottesman and chuang  @xcite introduced a classification of quantum gates known as the _ clifford hierarchy _ ( ch ) , which can be defined recursively  @xcite as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the pauli group .",
    "for example , @xmath36 is the group of operators that leave the pauli group invariant under conjugation and is called the clifford group .",
    "we shall describe some important clifford group gates @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 below . in prime qudit dimensions , these are known to generate the whole clifford group  @xcite .",
    "the gate @xmath40 is the qudit version of the hadamard gate ( also known as the discrete fourier transform ) , @xmath41 the @xmath42 gate is the generalisation of the qubit @xmath43-phase gate , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the controlled-@xmath46 gate ( also known as the sum gate ) , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the control and target qudits , respectively .",
    "the set of gates @xmath50 in the hierarchy contains all gates from lower levels of the hierarchy . to refer to gates in level @xmath51 of the hierarchy but not level @xmath52",

    ", it is known that it suffices to supplement the clifford group with just one non - clifford gate from the third level of the ch in order to obtain a universal set of gates  @xcite .",
    "such a gate is not unique , and in the qubit case , the @xmath53 gate @xmath54 is usually chosen for this purpose . for the qudit case , we choose the following particularly convenient definition for the @xmath53 gate , which is valid in all dimensions except when @xmath55  @xcite , @xmath56    it is a consequence of lemmas [ rlemma1 ] and [ rlemma2 ] ( below ) that for @xmath57 this gate is non - clifford and inhabits the third level of the ch . in @xmath58 and @xmath59 ,",
    "the gate defined in equation   is not non - clifford , as it reduces to the pauli @xmath7 gate since @xmath60 mod @xmath61 and mod @xmath62 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath88 .",
    "if the corresponding operator is proportional to the identity then this function must be constant , and thus @xmath89 .",
    "these two lemmas provide us with a simple way to generate gates at all levels of the clifford hierarchy as required .",

    "color codes  @xcite are a class of topological qubit stabilizer codes that be defined on a topological space of any spatial dimension  @xcite @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath1-dimensional manifold is celluated into a lattice of objects called @xmath93-_cells _ for all spatial dimensions @xmath94 .",
    "for example , vertices are @xmath95-cells , edges are @xmath96-cells and a @xmath97-cell is a cell defined on the faces , or plaquettes , of the lattice .",
    "we define    [ mucolex ] a lattice @xmath98 is called a @xmath1-colex ( colex is short for `` color complex '' ) whenever    1 .",

    "for example , the smallest 3-dimensional color code is a 15-qubit code defined on the lattice illustrated in figure  [ fig : tetra](a ) .",
    "the stabilizer group is generated by face operators ( with a @xmath7 operators assigned to the vertices around the face or 2-cell ) and cell operators ( with an @xmath11 operators assigned to the vertices around each 3-cell ) , see figure  [ fig : tetra](b ) .",
    "our results show a @xmath1-colex also defines a qudit color code .",

    "such codes can be constructed  @xcite by starting with a closed hyperspherical lattice and then removing a vertex to `` puncture '' the surface . alternatively , as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : code_distance ] , one can construct them directly by defining a suitable boundary on a regular lattice structure .",

    "the stabilizer generators are guaranteed to commute in this construction .",
    "those of the same type ( @xmath11 or @xmath7 ) trivially commute , while those of different types commute since they always meet in pairs .",
    "as already remarked , @xmath5 and @xmath104 commute only in @xmath20 .",
    "however , by replacing one operator of each pair with its complex conjugate we produce a pair of operators that commute for all @xmath0 .",
    "these are @xmath8 and @xmath105 .",
    "to define color codes in all qudit dimensions , we need , therefore , to find a construction which allows us to take advantage of the commutation of @xmath8 and @xmath105 .",
    "this can be achieved by identifying and exploiting a bipartition or bicoloring of the graph defining the lattice . to avoid confusion with other colorings of the lattice important for color codes we call this the star - bipartition .",
    "we note that a similar construction was defined ( for prime power qudit dimension only ) in  @xcite . here",

    "@xmath109 ; and 2 .",

    "lemmas  [ starlem ] and  [ starcelllem ] , or variants thereof , were already proved in prior research  @xcite .",
    "these results are especially important to qudit color codes and play a fundamental role , and so , for completeness , we present our own proofs .",
    "our presentation of lemma  [ starlem ] has the merit of being more concise than that of ref .",
    "@xcite . before presenting our proof",
    ", we review the concept of orientation from topology theory  @xcite .",
    "an orientation on a @xmath113-simplex is an ordered list of its vertices , with orientations considered equivalent whenever they differ by a permutation generated from an even number of transpositions ( a transposition is swap of two elements ) .",
    "all permutations can be generated by either an even or odd number of transpositions , and so there are two possible orientations for a @xmath113-simplex .",
    "the @xmath113-simplex contains subsimplices that can be obtained by removing a single vertex .",
    "this vertex removal provides an induced orientation on the subsimplex , such that removing @xmath114 from a simplex with orientation @xmath115 induces an orientation @xmath116 .",
    "consider two oriented @xmath113-simplices with a common subsimplex ( that is , they are are neighbors ) .",
    "we say their orientations are consistent if they induce opposite orientations to their common subsimplex .",
    "an entire lattice of simplices is said to be orientable if there exists a choice of orientations such that all pairs of simplices are consistently orientated .",
    "an example of a consistently orientated lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lemma3 ] .",
    "orientablity of a lattice is a topological feature that depends on the underlying manifold and from this definition one can show that many familiar manifolds are orientable , including euclidean , spherical and toroidal manifolds .",
    "we now employ these concepts in our proof .     moving clockwise round the simplex . for neighboring simplices @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ", we also show the induced orientation on their edges . for an edge orientation @xmath117",
    ", we illustrate this with an arrow going from @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "the simplices @xmath16 and @xmath17 induce opposite orientations to their common edge , and so are consistently orientated .",
    "if a simplex has an orientation @xmath120 with colors @xmath121 then we label it starred , and otherwise unstarred .",
    "the star - bipartition lemma further formalises this notion of starring in terms of color and orientation . ]    to prove the star - bipartition lemma , we switch to the dual lattice @xmath100 . in the dual picture , we need to show that the @xmath1-dimensional cells can be 2-colored .",
    "property 2 of def .",
    "[ mucolex ] ensures that the dual lattice is simplical .",
    "property 3 of def .",
    "[ mucolex ] ensures the dual vertices are @xmath99 colored .",
    "this coloring can be described by a map @xmath122 that assigns color label @xmath123 to vertex @xmath114 . given a simplex @xmath124 with an orientation , say @xmath125 , we can apply the color map to the orientation to obtain a colored - orientation @xmath126 .",
    "this defines a bipartition ( the star - bipartition ) with two simplicies belonging to the same partition if their colored - orientation differs by an even permutation .",
    "the remainder of the proof establishes that neighbouring simplicies belong to different partitions .",
    "two neighbouring oriented simplices @xmath16 and @xmath17 always share a common @xmath127 subsimplex .",
    "let us call the vertices they share in common @xmath128 .",
    "simplex @xmath16 also contains a vertex @xmath129 and we label its orientation @xmath130 .",
    "similarly , simplex @xmath17 contains additional vertex @xmath131 and has orientation @xmath132 where @xmath133 is some permutation of vertex labels .",
    "no generality is lost by placing @xmath129 and @xmath131 last in their respective orientations as this can always be achieved with an even number of transpositions ( assuming @xmath134 ) . since the manifold is orientable , we can assume a consistent orientation on their common subsimplex .",
    "we see that @xmath16 induces the orientation @xmath135 and @xmath17 induces the orientation @xmath136 , and so consistency demands that @xmath133 is an odd permutation of the vertex labels .",
    "next , we show this lifts to odd permutation in the color - orientation of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "simplex @xmath16 has color - orientation @xmath137 and simplex @xmath17 has color - orientation @xmath138 .",
    "since the lattice is @xmath139 colored , we know @xmath129 and @xmath131 must possess the same color , which is whatever color is absent from their common subsimplex .",
    "permutation of vertex labels results in a corresponding permutation of colors .",
    "therefore , the color - orientations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 differ by an odd permutation of their first @xmath113 elements , which corresponds to an overall odd permutation . since all neighboring @xmath1-simplicies must have opposite color - orientations , they belong to separate partitions of our star bipartition , proving the lemma .",
    "let us now turn to lemma  [ starcelllem ] .",
    "we shall begin with part _ 1 _ of the lemma .",
    "consider a bipartite lattice that is @xmath70-valent .",
    "we count the number of edges @xmath140 .",
    "every edge is incident to one , and only one , starred vertex .",
    "furthermore , each vertex is contained in @xmath70 edges , and so the total count is @xmath141 .",
    "the same argument applies to unstarred vertex , so @xmath142 . equating @xmath143",
    ", we see that @xmath144 entails @xmath145 .",
    "since a @xmath1-colex is @xmath99-valent , we have proven part _ 1 _ of lemma  [ starcelllem ] .",
    "consider any @xmath93-cell @xmath110 .",
    "it defines a sublattice @xmath146 with same vertex set as @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath146 is a @xmath93-valent with @xmath147 , then the above argument applies and @xmath110 contains equal number of starred and unstarred vertices .",
    "the following reasoning parallels that in ref .",
    "we show explicitly that @xmath146 is a @xmath93-colex for the @xmath148 case , but any @xmath93 is reached by iteratively applying the argument down to the desired @xmath93 .",
    "again , we must switch to the dual lattice where @xmath149 is obtained by removing a single vertex @xmath150 from @xmath100 .",
    "the sublattice @xmath149 retains all simplices containing @xmath150 , but with their dimension reduced by the removal of @xmath150 .",
    "therefore @xmath149 is a simplical lattice of dimension @xmath151 and so @xmath98 is @xmath1-valent .",
    "our proof only requires the correct valency , which we have shown , but note that @xmath146 also has the correct coloring for a @xmath151-colex .",
    "specifically , if @xmath152 and @xmath110 intersect on some @xmath151-cell of @xmath146 , then we assign it the color of @xmath152 .    the above results concern a lattice without a boundary",
    "however , if one punctures the code removing a starred vertex then we have    [ cor_punc ] let @xmath98 be puncturing of a @xmath1-colex , with the inherited bipartition into @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    ". then    1 .",
    "@xmath153 ; and 2 .",

    "property _ 1 _ is immediately follows from point _ 1 _ of lemma  [ starcelllem ] as a single starred vertex has been removed .",
    "2 _ is identical to its partner in lemma  [ starcelllem ] .",
    "the punctured lattice only keeps cells that did not contain the punctured vertex , and so the property is directly inherited . the dual lattice @xmath100 has been an essential proof tool for these lemmas , but in the rest of the paper we shall only consider the primal lattice .",
    "-type stabilizers colored red , green , blue and yellow . the 1-cells ( edges ) of the code",

    "before we write down the stabilizer generators for these codes , we shall use the star - bipartition to define notation for an important family of transversal operators which we call star - conjugate transversal . throughout this paper , when discussing color codes we identify qudits with vertices in the lattice defining the code .",

    "as in the qubit case , we associate @xmath7-type stabilizer generators with the @xmath160-cells of the lattice and @xmath11-type stabilizers with the @xmath161-cells  @xcite . in this section , for simplicity of presentation , we will take the example of @xmath162 so the @xmath7-type stabilizers are associated with plaquettes ( @xmath97-cells ) and @xmath11-type stabilizers are associated with @xmath1-cells , although the construction holds in the more general case , which we shall consider later .",

    "however , multiplying by a subset of the stabilizer group we can localize @xmath175 to any edge of the polytope formed by the lattice , where such an object is a 1-dimensional sub - manifold of the lattice between two of the vertices of the polytope .",
    "each such vertex is contained in only a single @xmath1-cell ( as opposed to those contained in two or more cells of the lattice ) , and hence there are exactly ( @xmath176 ) vertices of the polytope .    in @xmath1 spatial dimensions ,",
    "an edge of the polytope is comprised of 1-cells of two different colors .",

    "the constraints placed on the subset of stabilizers chosen , and the initial choice of transversal operator basis ensures that the minimum length of a string - like logical operator defined in this way is the length of the edge of the polytope colored as indicated .",
    "the minimum length of a string - like @xmath175 in such a definition , and hence the code distance , is then length of the shortest edge of the polytope .",
    "thus by showing that the length of an edge of the polytope can be made arbitrarily large we demonstrate the ability to create codes of any distance .",
    "we begin with an example in 3d and then generalize the argument to higher spatial dimensions .",
    "the particular choice we make for this example is a 4-colorable tiling of _ truncated octahedra _ , part of which is illustrated in figure  [ fig : truncated_octa ] .",
    "this is not a unique choice  for an alternative see  @xcite where the 3d color code is defined on a lattice constructed from cubes and truncated octahedra .",
    "in addition to the two lattices already mentioned , we have identified two further possible choices of regular tilings in 3d euclidean space on which a color code may be defined .",

    "the second is the omnitruncated cubic honeycomb comprising truncated cuboctahedra and octahedral prisms .",
    "this list is not exhaustive , for instance many more tilings may exist in curved space .",
    "the method proceeds by carefully cutting a block of the lattice out , in order to form a tetrahedron , similar to that illustrated in figure  [ fig : tetra](a ) .",

    "3 .   there should be exactly @xmath1 vertices that belong only to a single cell of the lattice .",
    "these cells should be different colors and these vertices will form the vertices of the polytope .",
    "errors are detected by measuring all the stabilizer generators .",
    "we shall not present a detailed analysis here , since errors and syndrome are related for these codes in a similar way to the qubit case .",
    "for example , in 3 spatial dimensions a single @xmath7-type error on an unstarred qudit will result in a measured eigenvalue of @xmath18 in the @xmath11 stabilizers corresponding to the four cells containing that vertex ( see figure [ fig : tetra ] ) .",
    "similarly , a single @xmath11-type error on an unstarred qudit will result in a measured eigenvalue of @xmath18 in the six faces that contain the vertex ( see figure [ fig : tetra ] ) .",

    "syndromes arising from sets of multiple errors can be calculated using standard techniques .",
    "a classical algorithm called a _ decoder _ may be used to interpret the syndrome and infer the correction operator that must be applied to return the code to its original state .",
    "there are many examples of decoding algorithms for 2d qubit color codes that have been developed recently  @xcite , but very little is known for the case of higher qudit and spatial dimensions .",
    "however , in the case of surface codes , it has been shown that some proposed renormalization group ( rg ) algorithms can be generalized to qudit codes in a straightforward manner  @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent work for the 3d fault - tolerant implementation of the qudit surface code using a hard - decision rg decoder  @xcite suggests that adaptations of such algorithms for higher spatial dimensions should be possible , however , the error correction thresholds would likely be degraded as the spatial dimension increases due to the larger stabilizer generators .",
    "we shall not present a decoder in this paper , but remark that , unlike in qubit codes where neighboring errors lead to cancellation of syndromes in between , such cancellation becomes unlikely with increasing qudit dimension , and thus in general more information is available to the decoder .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that it is possible to design decoders to exploit this additional information to obtain higher thresholds with respect to qubit codes  @xcite .",
    "for the case of gauge color codes , very recently a hard - decision rg decoder @xcite was implemented for the qubit 3d construction .",

    "these gauge qubits are not used to carry information and can be corrupted or measured during operations on the code .",
    "the logical operators @xmath202 and @xmath175 are products of @xmath11 and @xmath7 ( and @xmath165 and @xmath296 ) operators acting on every qudit .",
    "therefore , a natural candidate for transversal @xmath297 is a global star - conjugate hadamard .",
    "however , for color codes of @xmath3 it can be seen from the structure of the stabilizer generators that such a unitary will not leave the code space invariant .",
    "in particular , the @xmath11 stabilizers act on the @xmath160-cells of the lattice whereas the @xmath7 stabilizers act on the @xmath161-cells of the lattice . therefore unless @xmath298 , the @xmath7 stabilizers can not be transformed into valid @xmath11 ( cell ) stabilizers , by a global hadamard . the solution to this is to switch between the stabilizer color codes and a different code in which @xmath11 stabilizer generators and @xmath7 stabilizer generators have identical support .    in @xmath1 spatial dimensions",
    "the subsystem code stabilizers are defined as the star - conjugate @xmath11 and @xmath7 operators acting on the qudits contained in a @xmath1-cell of the lattice .",
    "the logical operators matching the color code logical operators are the transversal @xmath202 and @xmath175 defined in equations  .",
    "in addition there are @xmath11 and @xmath7 gauge operators defined on the @xmath151-cells , @xmath299-cells , and so on to the @xmath97-cells of the lattice , such that they commute with the stabilizer group .",
    "they can be identified in @xmath18-commuting pairs , with each pair protecting a gauge qudit .    in higher spatial dimensions",
    "there are a larger number of gauge generators and hence more gauge qudits than in lower spatial dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , the basic protocol for realising the logical hadamard gate in the subsystem code and fixing the gauge to return to the stabilizer code is independent of the spatial dimensions .    the star - conjugated transversal hadamard gate",
    ", @xmath300 \\otimes h^{*}[v_{\\star } ] , \\label{eqn : trans_h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] transforms the transversal logical operators and the stabilizers of the code correctly .",
    "however the gauge generators are corrupted under the action of @xmath297 , meaning that @xmath301 ( the @xmath7 logical operator for qudit @xmath279 ) is transformed not to @xmath302 as desired but instead to the operator for a different qudit , @xmath303 , causing the gauge qudits to become entangled .",
    "these corrupted gauge operators must be _ fixed _ , to return the code to the original stabilizer code in which the other transversal operators can be realized .",
    "this fixing is enacted by measuring the stabilizer generators .",
    "the measured eigenvalues will indicate the pauli correction operator that should be applied  this is an operator that restores the corrupted gauge qudit to its initial state while commuting with the other logical operators .",
    "once the corrections are applied , the gauge qudits are re - initialized to their original state so that any entanglement between the gauge qudits is destroyed .",
    "this is equivalent to the stabilizer color code with a logical hadamard applied to the encoded qudit .",
    "another approach to the implementation of the transversal hadamard is to treat the subsystem code as the base code , and to achieve the transversal non - clifford gates by gauge fixing to the ( stabilizer ) color code .",
    "this switch in perspective leads to the _ gauge color codes _ , recently introduced by bombin  @xcite .",
    "far more than a change in perspective , however , gauge color codes gain many useful new properties , which the original color codes do not possess .",
    "the first advantage of the gauge color code construction is that the outcome of stabilizer measurements can be inferred from measurements of the gauge operators .",
    "this offers a practical advantage , since the weight of the gauge generators can be significantly smaller than stabilizer generators .",
    "for example , in 3d the @xmath11 stabilizer generators would include 24-body operators associated with truncated octahedrons , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : code_distance ] , requiring coherent 24-body measurement . in the equivalent gauge color code , however , the @xmath11 stabilizers can be decomposed into 4- or 6-body @xmath11 gauge operator measurements , a much more practically feasible proposition .    a second advantage ( in the @xmath4 case )",
    "is that the outcome of stabilizer measurements is more robustly encoded in the gauge generator measurement .",
    "the extra redundancy leads to to `` single - shot fault - tolerant error correction ''  @xcite  meaning that measurement errors can be accounted for without the need for repeated measurements .",
    "a third advantage is that one can use gauge fixing to fault tolerantly convert  @xcite between codes of different spatial dimension  @xcite , allowing one to combine the advantageous features of both .",
    "for example , one could perform all clifford computations in a 2-d code while only resorting to a 3-d code to achieve a non - clifford gate .",
    "we can define qudit gauge color codes in any spatial dimension analogously to bombin s qubit codes  @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that operators are star - conjugated according to the star - bipartition of the lattice .",
    "the most studied gauge color code exists on a 3d lattice and we shall describe the qudit analogue as an example .",
    "gauge generators consist of star - conjugated face operators of both @xmath11 and @xmath7-type .",
    "the stabilizer is generated by 3-cell operators whose values can be obtained from the products of the face operators .",
    "the star - conjugate transversality of the hadamard gate for this code is trivial via its definition . to achieve a transversal @xmath53 gate",
    "one must gauge fix back to the stabilizer color code by promoting @xmath7 face operators to the stabilizer .",
    "although the basic properties of color codes transfer immediately to the general qudit case via this definition and by the results presented in previous sections in this paper , the performance of single - shot error correction is less straightforward to analyze , and we leave a detailed study to further work .",
    "single - shot error correction works , in the qubit case , because the relationship between gauge and stabilizer measurement outcomes in the code is such that the values of the stabilizer are mapped to delocalized structures ( branching points in string - like extended structures ) in the gauge outcomes .",
    "this arises because the parity of the outcomes of the face operators around the cell must be equal to the eigenvalue of the stabilizer representing the cell , even parity in for a trivial syndrome , and odd - parity for the non - trivial case .    in qudit codes",
    ", the stabilizer measurement outcome may take any of @xmath304 non - trivial values .",
    "the outcomes of gauge measurements must sum to these values .",
    "thus the relationship between gauge measurements and stabilizer measurements is more complicated than the simple `` branching point or no branching point '' behavior seen in the qubit code .",
    "this extra structure , however , should represent additional information about the location and charge of stabilizer outcomes which a decoder could exploit .",
    "thus , with the development of a suitable decoder , we expect single - shot error correction robust to measurement error to be achieved in qudit gauge color codes , but we leave its the construction of such a decoder , and analysis of its performance , to future work .",
    "the outcomes of the gauge measurements for each of the red faces , or each of the blue faces , or each of the green faces.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "we have shown how any existing qubit color code can be generalized to support a qudit color code in arbitrary spatial dimensions , and with an arbitrarily large distance . to do this",
    "we introduced the notion of a star - conjugate lattice and showed how this construction allows the clifford phase , controlled-@xmath11 and non - clifford phase gates to be implemented transversally .",
    "the set of clifford group generators is completed by the hadamard , which can be implemented in a subsystem code . techniques for switching between the two codes have been outlined .",
    "an additional advantage of considering the color codes as gauge codes is reduction of the weight of measurements required to obtain the error syndrome .",
    "there are still many open questions remaining  here we shall outline some of the ones we find most interesting .",
    "although a fault - tolerant decoder has been implemented for a 2d code , no decoder has , to our knowledge , been proposed for color codes in higher spatial dimensions . in ref .",
    "@xcite a decoder for a 3d gauge color code is discussed , unfortunately however , a classical algorithm capable of performing the decoding is not specified .",
    "one would expect that in a fully fault - tolerant simulation the gate error threshold for the @xmath1-dimensional color codes would be prohibitively low , since the stabilizers defined on the @xmath1-cells would require circuits of many time steps to measure .",
    "there is hope however that by switching to the corresponding gauge color code the measurements require fewer gates and therefore the threshold may recover  @xcite .",
    "the development of efficient decoders for qudit gauge color codes is therefore of significant interest .",
    "the construction of the transversal gates in the color codes and gauge color codes presented in this work holds for qudits of any dimension , @xmath0 .",
    "however , for non - prime @xmath0 it is not clear that @xmath38 , @xmath37 and @xmath39 are sufficient to generate the clifford group .",
    "we desire a better understanding of universality and the clifford hierarchy when using systems of non - prime dimension .",
    "we have identified some other lattices that can support a color code in 3d .",
    "it would be interesting to see a comprehensive list of possible lattices .",
    "furthermore , our star - conjugate construction is valid for all of these lattices , but there may be one that offers advantages in terms of the necessary qudit overhead to achieve a desired distance .    finally , there are many reed - muller codes known for qudits for which no equivalent color code is known  @xcite .",
    "is it possible to use one of these to construct a topological code similar to a color code and study its properties ?",
    "here , we found codes where the distance is purely topological in nature , and so depends on the lattice not on whether we use qudits .",
    "in contrast , qudit reed - muller codes provide an improved distance that is algebraic rather than topological in origin .",
    "the potential exists for qudit quantum codes which abstract topological ideas to a more general setting to generate novel codes of arbitrary code distance with a rich family of transversal logical gates .",
