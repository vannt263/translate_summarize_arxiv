    "<S> the paper that is commented by touchette contains a computational study which opens the door to a desirable generalization of the standard large deviation theory ( applicable to a set of @xmath0 nearly independent random variables ) to systems belonging to a special , though ubiquitous , class of strong correlations . </S>",
    "<S> it focuses on three inter - related aspects , namely ( i ) we exhibit strong numerical indications which suggest that the standard exponential probability law is asymptotically replaced by a power - law as its dominant term for large @xmath0 ; ( ii ) the subdominant term appears to be consistent with the @xmath1-exponential behavior typical of systems following @xmath1-statistics , thus reinforcing the thermodynamically extensive entropic nature of the exponent of the @xmath1-exponential , basically @xmath0 times the @xmath1-generalized rate function ; ( iii ) the class of strong correlations that we have focused on corresponds to attractors in the sense of the central limit theorem which are @xmath2-gaussian distributions ( in principle @xmath3 ) , which relevantly differ from ( symmetric ) lvy distributions , with the unique exception of cauchy - lorentz distributions ( which correspond to @xmath4 ) , where they coincide , as well known . in his comment , touchette has agreeably discussed point ( i ) , but , unfortunately , points ( ii ) and ( iii ) have , as we detail here , visibly escaped to his analysis . consequently </S>",
    "<S> , his conclusion claiming the absence of special connection with @xmath1-exponentials is unjustified .    before addressing in detail the comment by touchette @xcite on our paper @xcite , </S>",

    "<S> this is to be compared with the ldt probability @xmath10 , where the rate function @xmath11 ( the meaning of the subindex @xmath12 will soon become clear ) is related to a bg entropic quantity _ per particle _ , and plays a role analogous to @xmath13 $ ] ( we remind that , for such standard systems , @xmath14 is an intensive variable ) .    </S>",
    "<S> if now we focus on say a @xmath15-dimensional classical system involving two- body interactions whose potential asymptotically decays at long distance @xmath16 like @xmath17 @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> the canonical bg partition function converges whenever the potential is integrable , i.e. for @xmath19 ( short - range interactions ) , and diverges whenever it is nonintegrable , i.e. for @xmath20 ( long - range interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the bg weight becomes unjustified [  illusory \" in gibbs words @xcite for say newtonian gravitation , which in the present notation corresponds to @xmath21 , hence @xmath22 in the later case because of the divergence of the bg partition function . </S>",
    "<S> we might therefore expect the emergence of some function @xmath23 different from the exponential one , in order to describe some specific stationary ( or quasi - stationary ) states differing from thermal equilibrium . </S>",

    "<S> the quantity @xmath35 can be rewritten as @xmath36n = [ { \\tilde \\beta}{\\cal h}_n /(n{\\tilde n})]n$ ] , where @xmath37 plays the role of an intensive variable . the correctness of all these scalings has been profusely verified in various kinds of thermal @xcite , diffusive @xcite and geometrical ( percolation ) @xcite systems ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
