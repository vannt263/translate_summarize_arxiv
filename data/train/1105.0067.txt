    "resonant absorption , caused by plasma inhomogeneity in the direction transverse to the magnetic field , has proved to be the most likely candidate for explaining the observed attenuation of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) kink waves in the solar atmosphere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review about this damping mechanism ) .",
    "e.g. , resonant absorption is a feasible explanation for the damping of kink mhd waves in both coronal loops @xcite and in the fine structure of solar prominences ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "most of theoretical studies of resonant absorption assume that the inhomogeneity is in the radial direction exclusively , and only a few works ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have studied the properties of resonantly damped standing kink waves when plasma inhomogeneity is also present in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "these studies have been restricted to standing waves , so the amplitude of the standing wave is damped in time as a result of the resonance . nevertheless , there are observational indications of spatial damping of propagating waves along different waveguides in the solar atmosphere .",
    "some clear examples have been reported by @xcite and @xcite in coronal loops using coronal multi - channel polarimeter ( comp ) data .",
    "other observational evidence of propagating kink waves in wave guides of the solar atmosphere are , e.g. , @xcite in spicules , @xcite in the fine structure of prominences , and @xcite in filament threads .",
    "the theoretical modeling of the spatial damping of traveling kink waves due to resonant absorption has been carried out by @xcite and @xcite analytically , and by @xcite numerically .",
    "all these works assumed a homogeneous density in the longitudinal direction .",
    "@xcite showed that the damping length by resonant absorption is inversely proportional to the wave frequency .",
    "it was predicted that high - frequency waves become damped in length scales smaller than low - frequency waves .",
    "@xcite showed that this theory is consistent with the comp observations reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this means that in solar waveguides resonant absorption acts as a natural low - pass filter .",
    "some recent investigations have extended the analytical work of @xcite by adding effects not considered in their original paper .",
    "@xcite took into account the effect of partial ionization in the single - fluid approximation , so kink waves are damped by both resonant absorption and ion - neutral collisions in their configuration .",
    "@xcite concluded that in thin tubes the effect of resonant absorption dominates , recovering the result of @xcite in the fully ionized case that the damping length is inversely proportional to the frequency .",
    "therefore , the result of @xcite allows the theory developed by @xcite to be applied to kink waves in partially ionized plasmas as , e.g. , chromospheric spicules and solar prominences .",
    "alternately , @xcite have shown that in the presence of flow the damping length remains inversely proportional to the frequency , but the factor of proportionality is different for forward and backward propagating waves to the flow direction and depends on the characteristics of the flow . however , none of these previous works investigated the effect of longitudinal stratification .",
    "the analysis of kink mhd waves in longitudinally homogeneous models make some problems more tractable from an analytical point of view .",
    "realistic models of solar waveguides should include longitudinal stratification .",
    "e.g. , coronal loops can extend out into the atmosphere up to heights of the order of several density scale heights .",
    "this means that the differences in the density at their footpoints and apex can be significant .",
    "there is evidence of such stratification in coronal loops both from emission measure analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and coronal magnetoseismology ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for review of this topic )",
    ". regarding spicules , there have been spectroscopic line intensity studies to show the plasma density is longitudinally strongly stratified ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more recently by magnetoseismology @xcite .",
    "it is also clear from h@xmath0 observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that prominence threads too exhibit longitudinal density inhomogeneity . for these reasons ,",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to investigate the effect of longitudinal stratification on the properties of resonantly damped propagating kink waves .",
    "this is an interesting problem from a theoretical , as well as observational point of view .",
    "the reason is that a radial variation of density causes damping due to resonant absorption while a longitudinal variation might cause an increase of the amplitude .",
    "an increase of the amplitude due to stratification along the magnetic field direction has been obtained by , e.g. , @xcite for phase mixed alfvn waves and @xcite for propagating slow modes .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of longitudinal density variation on propagating kink waves by using both analytical and numerical approaches .",
    "analytical theory is used to the largest possible extent . to do so",
    ", we apply standard approximations usually adopted in the preceding literature for the investigation of kink waves in magnetic tubes .",
    "the approximations used in the analytical part of this paper are briefly discussed and justified in the next two paragraphs .",
    "in addition to the analytical theory , the problem is solved numerically beyond the limitations of the analytical approximations .",
    "the comparison between the analytical results and those from the full numerical simulations will enable us to check the validity of the analytical theory .",
    "our waveguide model is a straight cylindrical magnetic flux tube , inhomogeneous in both the radial and longitudinal directions , and embedded in a magnetized environment . to investigate propagating kink waves",
    "analytically we adopt the following approximations .",
    "we use the thin tube ( tt ) approximation , so that the wavelength , @xmath1 , is much larger than the radius of the tube , @xmath2 .",
    "this condition is easily fulfilled for propagating waves observed in the solar atmosphere ( see the various references given above ) .",
    "the variation of density in the radial direction is confined to a thin transitional layer , and we adopt the thin boundary ( tb ) approximation ( see details in , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the tb approximation has been proved to be very accurate even when radial inhomogeneity is not restricted to a thin layer ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regarding inhomogeneity in the longitudinal direction , we assume that the kink mode wavelength is shorter than the longitudinal inhomogeneity length scale , so that the wkb approximation can be applied . in the numerical part of this paper ,",
    "the problem is solved in the general case where large variations of density in both the radial and longitudinal directions are considered and for arbitrary wavelength .    curvature is neglected in the model .",
    "the effect of curvature was studied by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , and it has been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "analytically , @xcite showed that curvature has no first - order effect on the frequency and the damping of kink modes in curved cylindrical models .",
    "the result that curvature has only a minor effect on kink mhd waves was also numerically confirmed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "wave damping due to leakage is not considered .",
    "leaky waves , i.e. , waves damped by mhd radiation , were first studied in magnetic flux tubes by @xcite , whose conclusion was that leakage is only important for wavelengths of the order of the tube radius or smaller . for thin tubes leakage",
    "is unimportant .",
    "this result was confirmed by @xcite and @xcite . finally , the @xmath3 approximation is also adopted , where @xmath4 is the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure .",
    "the assumption of @xmath3 implies that waves do not have motions along the equilibrium magnetic field direction .",
    "it has been explained by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite that the longitudinal component of the velocity is proportional to the transverse component , with a factor of proportionality that depends of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the low-@xmath4 case and for thin tubes",
    "the longitudinal component of the velocity is much smaller than the transverse component . in magnetic structures of the solar atmosphere @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the longitudinal component of the velocity can be neglected and the @xmath3 approximation can be safely adopted . for the effect of plasma @xmath4 on the resonant damping of kink waves , @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that the contribution of the slow continuum damping , present when @xmath7 , is negligible compared to the alfvn continuum damping .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the description of the model configuration and basic equations are given in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "then , we obtain general expressions for the amplitude and wavelength of propagating kink waves in longitudinally and transversely inhomogeneous magnetic flux tubes in section  [ sec : general ] .",
    "later , we use these general expressions to study resonantly damped propagating kink waves in stratified solar waveguides and compare the analytical predictions with full numerical time - dependent simulations in section  [ sec : appli ] .",
    "the implications for the method of solar atmospheric magnetoseismology are given in section  [ sec : seis ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : discussion ] contains the discussion of the results and our conclusions .",
    "in the @xmath3 approximation , the basic equations for the discussion of linear ideal mhd waves are , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the plasma density , @xmath10 is the equilibrium magnetic field , @xmath11 is the velocity perturbation , @xmath12 is the magnetic field perturbation , and @xmath13 is the magnetic permittivity .",
    "we use linear theory in our investigation because the alfvn velocity in the solar corona is of the order of 1000  km  s@xmath14 , while the peak - to - peak velocity amplitude of the propagating waves observed using comp is only about 1  km  s@xmath14 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we study mhd waves in a static background , so the equilibrium flow is absent from our discussion .",
    "the effect of flow on resonantly damped propagating kink waves has been recently studied by @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium configuration is a straight cylindrical magnetic flux tube of average radius @xmath2 embedded in a magnetized plasma environment . for convenience ,",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates , namely @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for the radial , azimuthal , and longitudinal coordinates , respectively .",
    "the axis of the cylinder is set along the @xmath17-direction . in the following expressions ,",
    "subscripts @xmath18 and @xmath19 refer to the internal and external plasmas , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 and @xmath21 the internal and external densities , respectively .",
    "both of these quantities are functions of @xmath17 .",
    "there is a nonuniform transitional layer in the transverse direction that continuously connects the internal density to the external density .",
    "the thickness of the layer is @xmath22 , and extends in the interval @xmath23 .",
    "the equilibrium magnetic field is straight and homogeneous , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 constant . as @xmath16 is an ignorable coordinate in our model and we consider waves propagating along the tube with a fixed frequency , we write all perturbations proportional to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the azimuthal wavenumber and @xmath28 is the wave ( angular ) frequency .",
    "the frequency @xmath29 is related to @xmath28 by @xmath30 .",
    "kink modes , i.e. , the only wave modes that can displace the magnetic cylinder axis and so produce transverse motions of the whole flux tube ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are described by @xmath31 . due to the presence of a transverse inhomogeneous transitional layer , wave modes with @xmath32",
    "are spatially damped by resonant absorption . in the position within the transverse inhomogeneous transitional layer where the wave frequency coincides with the local alfvn frequency , i.e. , the resonance position , the wave character changes and becomes more alfvnic as the wave propagates . as a result of this process , transverse motions of the flux tube are damped while azimuthal motions within the transitional layer are amplified .",
    "we use the tt approximation , i.e. , @xmath33 , where @xmath1 is the wavelength along the tube , and apply the formalism of @xcite .",
    "the effect of the resonant damping is included here by introducing jump conditions for perturbations at the resonance position along with the tb approximation ( see details in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . the combination of both tt and tb approximations is usually called the tttb approach ( see the recent review by * ? ? ? *",
    ") . then , following the scaling arguments of @xcite , the total pressure perturbation @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the longitudinal component of the magnetic field perturbation , evaluated at both sides of the transverse transitional layer can be cast as @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 arbitrary functions of @xmath17 . in the tb approximation ,",
    "the condition of @xmath39 continuity across the resonant layer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "now , we take into account that in the tb approximation the jump of @xmath44 across the resonance layer , namely @xmath51 $ ] , is assumed to be the same as the jump of @xmath44 across the whole transverse inhomogeneous layer , i.e. , @xmath52 $ ] . for a straight and constant magnetic field ,",

    "note that the imaginary parts of the coefficient functions @xmath62@xmath63 are all proportional to @xmath27 .      as a limiting case of equation  ( [ eq : vrfull ] ) ,",
    "we study wave propagation in a magnetic tube which is uniform in the longitudinal direction and try to recover the results of ( * ? ? ?",

    "the reader is referred to tgv for a complete analysis of this case .",
    "it is worth noting that equation  ( [ eq : relkzrkzi ] ) also agrees with equation  ( 20 ) of @xcite , obtained for the spatial damping of propagating kink waves in partially ionized threads of solar prominences , if the effect of damping by ion - neutral collisions is removed from their expression .",

    "first , we study the case when resonant damping is absent to assess the effect of density stratification on the amplitude of the propagating kink wave .",
    "damping will be considered later .",
    "then , equation  ( [ eq : vrfull ] ) reduces to @xmath74 note that equation  ( [ eq : basicnores ] ) is independent of the azimuthal wavenumber , @xmath27 . in the absence of damping , the waves are degenerate with respect to @xmath27 as long as @xmath75 .    to find a solution to equation  ( [ eq : basicnores ] )",
    ", we use the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for details about the method ) .",
    "we define the dimensionless longitudinal coordinate as , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the longitudinal inhomogeneity scale height , and express the solution of equation  ( [ eq : basicnores ] ) in the following form , @xmath78 , \\label{eq : wkb}\\ ] ] with @xmath79 and @xmath80 functions to be determined .",
    "the validity of the wkb approximation , and so of equation  ( [ eq : wkb ] ) , is restricted to large values of @xmath77 , i.e. , weak inhomogeneity , such as @xmath81 .",
    "we combine equations  ( [ eq : basicnores ] ) and ( [ eq : wkb ] ) , and separate the different terms according to their order with respect to @xmath77 . as @xmath77 is large , the dominant terms are those with the highest order in @xmath77 . from the leading term , i.e. , that with @xmath82 , we obtain the following expression , @xmath83 where @xmath84 has been defined as @xmath85 we see that @xmath84 plays the role of the longitudinal wavenumber , which in our case is a function of @xmath86 through the dependence of the kink velocity on @xmath86 ( equation  ( [ eq : vk ] ) ) . therefore , the wavelength , @xmath87 , is @xmath88 with @xmath89 the wave period .",
    "we obtain that @xmath87 changes in @xmath86 due to stratification . therefore , function @xmath90 is @xmath91 where we have assumed @xmath92 .    on the other hand , from the contribution of @xmath93 in the wkb expansion of equation  ( [ eq : basicnores ] ) , we get the following expression @xmath94 which can be easily integrated to @xmath95 equation  ( [ eq : amp ] ) tells us how the amplitude changes with height due to density stratification .",
    "density stratification modifies both the amplitude and the wavelength of the kink wave as it propagates along the magnetic tube .",
    "if density decreases with height , and hence the kink velocity increases with height , equations  ( [ eq : amp ] ) and ( [ eq : wavelength ] ) show that both the wavelength and the amplitude increase .",
    "the complete expression for @xmath44 in the wkb approximation using the original variable @xmath17 is @xmath96      hereafter , we include the effect of damping by resonant absorption and we try to solve the full equation  ( [ eq : vrfull ] ) . as a completely general solution to equation  ( [ eq : vrfull ] )",

    "while the effect of longitudinal stratification depends on whether the density increases or decrease with @xmath17 , the role of resonant absorption is always to damp the wave and so to decrease its amplitude .",

    "apart from the exact expression of @xmath44 given in equation  ( [ eq : vrgen ] ) , we also can obtain an expression in the wkb approximation , which is instructive to understand the wave properties .",

    "we see that density stratification increases both amplitude and wavelength of the kink wave as it propagates along the loop from the footpoint to the apex . in the limit of no longitudinal stratification ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath154 , equations  ( [ eq : vrassymapp ] ) and ( [ eq : wavelengthapp ] ) simply reduce to @xmath155 which corresponds to the propagating kink wave in a longitudinally homogeneous tube with constant kink velocity @xmath156 .",
    "both the amplitude and the wavelength are constants in this case .",
    "we compare in figure  [ fig : comp ] the exact @xmath157 given by equation  ( [ eq : vrgen ] ) with the expression in the wkb approximation ( equation  ( [ eq : vrassymapp ] ) ) for a particular set of parameters .",
    "we see that there is a very good agreement between both equations .",
    "the effect of longitudinal stratification on both the wavelength and the amplitude is clearly seen in figure  [ fig : comp ] .      here",
    ", we include the effect of damping by resonant absorption . as an exact solution of equation  ( [ eq : vrfull ] )",
    "is very difficult to obtain , we use the expressions derived in the wkb approximation .",
    "first of all , the expression for @xmath158 is the same as given in equation  ( [ eq : wavelengthapp ] ) in the case without resonant damping .",

    "we see that there are two competing effects that determine the amplitude of the propagating kink wave . on the one hand",
    ", density stratification causes the amplitude to increase with height ; on the other hand , resonant absorption damps the kink wave , so its effect is to decrease the amplitude .",
    "whereas the increase of the amplitude due to longitudinal stratification is independent of @xmath28 , the damping by resonant absorption does depend on @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we can anticipate that for a particular , critical frequency , @xmath164 , the amplitude may be a constant independent of @xmath17 .",
    "however , due to the functional dependence of equation  ( [ eq : amptotres ] ) on @xmath17 , we clearly see that the amplitude can not remain constant for all @xmath17 . despite this fact ,",
    "it is still possible to give an expression for the critical frequency for which the amplitude is a approximately constant for small @xmath17 only .",
    "to do so , we approximate @xmath165 \\approx   z/(2 \\lambda)$ ] in equation  ( [ eq : amptotres ] ) . then , we obtain @xmath166 for @xmath167 longitudinal stratification is the dominant effect and the amplitude increase with @xmath17 . on the contrary , for @xmath168 damping by resonant absorption",
    "is more efficient and the amplitude decreases in @xmath17 .",
    "we must bear in mind that equation  ( [ eq : relationamp0 ] ) is only valid for small @xmath17 , i.e. , close to the footpoint of the loop , but gives us some qualitative information about the behavior of the amplitude depending on the value of the frequency .    in figure",
    "[ fig : reso ] we plot @xmath157 for fixed frequency and longitudinal inhomogeneity scale height , but for different values of @xmath169 . in the case",
    "@xmath170 there is no resonant damping . as @xmath169 increases",
    ", the wave amplitude decreases as a result of resonant absorption .",
    "however , we see that the wavelength is independent of the value of @xmath169 .",
    "this means that , in the tttb approximation , resonant absorption does not affect the value of the wavelength , which is exclusively determined by the longitudinal inhomogeneity scale height .",
    "this is an important result from the observational point of view , because the wavelength carries information about longitudinal stratification only ( equation  ( [ eq : wavelength ] ) ) , while the amplitude is influenced by both longitudinal and transverse density profiles ( equation  ( [ eq : amptot ] ) ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ampli ] displays the kink wave amplitude computed from equation  ( [ eq : amptotres ] ) for different combinations of parameters . in figure",
    "[ fig : ampli](a ) we determine the effect of @xmath169 when the remaining quantities are kept constant , while figure  [ fig : ampli](b ) and ( c ) show the effect of @xmath28 and @xmath171 , respectively .",
    "both @xmath169 and @xmath28 have a similar effect on the amplitude as both of them control the efficiency of the resonant damping in front of the increase of the amplitude due to stratification .",
    "when both @xmath169 and @xmath28 get larger , the effect of resonant damping becomes stronger . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath171 controls the role of longitudinal stratification through @xmath77 ( equation  ( [ eq : deflamstrat ] ) ) .",
    "as @xmath171 grows ( @xmath77 decreases ) , the increase in amplitude due to stratification becomes more important .",
    "for the set of parameters used in figure  [ fig : ampli](b ) , the approximate critical frequency for a constant amplitude according to equation  ( [ eq : relationamp0 ] ) is @xmath172 .",
    "we see that , as expected , for the critical frequency , amplitude is constant for small @xmath17 , but then increases slightly with larger @xmath17 .",
    "we stress again that , for fixed frequency , the amplitude is determined by the combined effect of longitudinal stratification and transverse inhomogeneity , while the wavelength is only affected by longitudinal stratification .      here",
    "the aim is to show how the analytical results derived in the previous sections for the eigenmode problem are related to the time - dependent problem .",
    "in addition , we go beyond the tt and tb approximations used in the derivation of the analytical expressions , allowing us further insight . to study the problem of linear propagating waves , equations  ( [ eq : b1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : b2 ] ) are numerically solved in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "since we are only interested in the kink mode we assume an azimuthal dependence of the form @xmath173 with @xmath31 , and the equations are integrated in the radial and longitudinal coordinates ( @xmath15 and @xmath17 in our case , respectively ) .",
    "a driver at the footpoint of the loop ( @xmath132 ) , with a single frequency @xmath28 , is introduced to excite propagating waves along the tube .",
    "the spatial form of the driver in the radial direction is chosen , to simplify things , to be the eigenmode of a loop with no resonant layer .",
    "this enables us to mainly excite the resonantly damped modes , while the direct excitation of alfvn modes is very weak .",
    "thus , the driver at @xmath132 is implemented through the periodic variation in time and the radial dependence of the kink mode eigenfunctions .",
    "the simulations are done with the code molmhd ( see * ? ? ?",

    "note that in the previous sections , the dimensionless frequency has been written as @xmath180 , with @xmath181 .",
    "the relation between the two time scales is @xmath182 .",
    "hereafter , we concentrate on the analysis of the two main variables , @xmath44 and @xmath183 , i.e. , the radial and azimuthal velocity perturbations , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : vr_vphi ] shows the two - dimensional spatial distribution of the two velocity components , @xmath44 and @xmath183 , at a given time and for a particular set of parameters .",
    "the driver excites propagating waves that move upwards along the tube with a characteristic wavelength and amplitude .",
    "the amplitude inside the tube decreases with height for both @xmath44 and @xmath183 , while the @xmath183 component shows a significant increase in @xmath17 within the inhomogeneous layer ( see the work by * ? ? ? * for a longitudinally homogeneous loop ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : vr_vphi_z ] , we perform two cuts along the @xmath17-direction of @xmath44 at @xmath184 and @xmath183 at @xmath185 .",
    "the radial velocity perturbation at the center of the loop decreases its amplitude in @xmath17 due to the combined effect of longitudinal stratification and resonant absorption . on the contrary",
    ", the amplitude of @xmath183 at @xmath185 grows in @xmath17 because of the conversion from radial to azimuthal motions that takes place in the inhomogeneous layer due to the alfvn resonance . as a consequence of this process more",
    "energy is concentrated in the layer in the form of azimuthal motions as the wave propagates upwards along the loop .",
    "first , we perform some test cases in order to compare the full numerical solutions with the analytical expressions in the tttb and wkb approximation .",
    "we start with an example that satisfies both the tttb and wkb approximations . in this example",
    "the frequency of the driver is @xmath186 .",
    "the transitional layer thickness is set to @xmath187 , i.e. , we consider a a thin layer , and the stratification scale height is @xmath188",
    ". waves with a wavelength much longer that the tube radius and much shorter than the stratification scale height are excited .",
    "therefore , we are in the tttb and wkb regimes . in figure",
    "[ fig : vr_l200l_0.1 ] we plot the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath44 at @xmath184 .",
    "the radial velocity perturbation shows an almost constant amplitude in @xmath17 , while the wavelength increases slightly with height . in this particular example , the effect of longitudinal stratification and resonant absorption on the amplitude cancel each other .",
    "the numerical curve is in quite good agreement with the analytical expression given by equation  ( [ eq : vrexpres ] ) .",
    "thus , this simulation shows that the assumptions made to derive equation  ( [ eq : vrexpres ] ) are well justified when @xmath189 .",
    "the almost negligible differences between the numerical and analytical results become smaller as we take smaller values of @xmath2 and larger values of @xmath77 .",
    "next , we show how the results are modified when we depart from the valid regimes of the tttb and wkb approximations . in a second example ( see figure  [ fig : vr_l200l_0.1w ] ) the driver frequency is @xmath190 and the rest of parameters are the same as in the previous case , but now the excited kink wavelength is almost twice smaller than before and the assumption of tt may be compromised .",
    "the comparison of the numerical result and analytical tttb expression indicates that for large @xmath17 the analytical formula overestimates both amplitude of oscillation and wavelength . in our third example , we return to the case with @xmath186 but we use a larger value of the transitional layer thickness , @xmath191 .",
    "then , we are not in the tb regime . the results in this case ( see figure  [ fig : vr_l200l_0.4 ] )",
    "point out that the analytical expressions predict a stronger damping of amplitude and a larger increase of wavelength with @xmath17 in comparison with our numerical results . in our last case ,",
    "we test the wkb approximation by considering that the wavelength of the excited kink mode is not much shorter than the stratification scale height .",
    "first we take in figure  [ fig : vr_l50l_0.1 ] the same parameters as in figure  [ fig : vr_l200l_0.1 ] but with @xmath192 and @xmath186 . now",
    "the wavelength and the stratification scale height are of the same order , approximately , and we are not in the wkb regime strictly .",
    "next in figure  [ fig:10 ] we use exactly the same parameters but @xmath193 , so that the wavelength is longer than the stratification scale height and the condition of applicability of the wkb approximation is violated . however , both figures  [ fig : vr_l50l_0.1 ] and [ fig:10 ] show that the full numerical solutions and the wkb results are in remarkable good agreement .",
    "the numerical simulations performed in this section tell us that the analytical expressions derived in the tttb and wkb approximations are very accurate when kink wavelength is in the range @xmath189 and @xmath194 .",
    "we also obtain a very good agreement when the condition @xmath195 is relaxed . for thick layers ,",
    "i.e. , outside the tb approximation , the analytical expression for the amplitude gives a slightly stronger damping than in the full numerical case , although the wavelength remains approximately correct .",
    "if instead we depart from the tt approximation , the analytical approximation of amplitude and wavelength gives slightly larger values in comparison with the numerical results .",
    "however , as can be seen in figures  [ fig : vr_l200l_0.1w][fig:10 ] , the differences between the numerical simulations and the analytical predictions are remarkably small even in the worst case scenarios studied here .",
    "the theoretical results of this paper show that determining the longitudinal and transverse inhomogeneity length scales of solar waveguides from observations of propagating kink waves is not a trivial matter . as was shown in section",
    "[ exploit ] , if we can observationally identify the wavelength ( or phase speed ) as a function of @xmath17 , we know this is independent of the transverse inhomogeneity . therefore , if we can simultaneously estimate the wavelength ( or phase speed ) and amplitude of the kink wave as a function of @xmath17 we will have enough information to quantify the possible contribution of resonant absorption on attenuating the observed amplitude .",
    "however , observationally this presents difficult challenges . in the wkb approximation",
    ", for a flux tube with density stratification , constant magnetic field and no resonant layer , equation ( [ eq : vrassym ] ) shows that the velocity amplitude is related to the phase speed by @xmath196 hence if this relationship does not hold for an observed wave , the discrepancy could be caused by damping due to the presence of a resonant layer , i.e. , transverse inhomogeneity . at present a possible avenue to for this type of magnetoseismology is by using the high spatial / temporal resolution solar optical telescope ( sot ) onboard hinode . using the ca ii",
    "broadband filter of sot chromospheric kink waves propagating in spicules can be analyzed . as was shown by @xcite",
    ", it is possible to track both the propagating kink wave amplitudes and phase speeds from the photosphere up to the lower corona . @xcite",
    "have also shown time snapshots of these propagating waves that nicely show the relationship between wavelength and amplitude with height . unfortunately , since there are only a few wavelengths detected up to the visible apex of spicules it is difficult to detect a clear trend in the variation of wavelength with height .",
    "therefore a more practical approach of estimating @xmath197 is by tracking the phase travel time of the kink wave as was done by @xcite .    regarding comp data",
    ", @xcite attempted to estimate the damping length of kink waves propagating along coronal loops , assuming the plasma was longitudinally homogeneous . to interpret comp data , assuming there is longitudinal variation in plasma density , as stated previously , we need both information about velocity amplitude and phase speed to see if equation ( [ undamped ] ) holds .",
    "certainly , @xcite showed that it was possible to estimate @xmath197 from their time - distance plots ( see figure 5 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , since the velocity amplitudes were small ( only a few km @xmath14s ) it will be more of a challenge to estimate the longitudinal variation of this quantity .",
    "we must also mention the physical limitation of using a model flux tube with constant magnetic field .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that if the magnetic field is varying longitudinally ( still with density stratification ) , in the thin tube approximation equation ( [ undamped ] ) becomes @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the flux tube radius . indeed ,",
    "equation ( [ rundamped ] ) was used by @xcite as the basis for interpreting propagating kink waves in a spicules to determine chromospheric flux tube expansion , since both @xmath200 and @xmath197 were estimated from observation .",
    "it can be seen from equation ( [ rundamped ] ) that if there is a resonant layer present , assuming ideal mhd will cause the expansion of flux tube with height to be underestimated . of course ,",
    "equation ( [ rundamped ] ) can also be applied to comp observations of propagating kink waves to estimate the variation of the magnetic field along coronal loops since in the thin tube flux conservation is given by @xmath201 .",
    "magnetoseismology of post - flare standing kink waves in coronal loops , allowing for both longitudinal variation in magnetic field strength and plasma density was first done by @xcite , therefore it would be interesting to see if propagating coronal kink waves could be exploited for a similar purpose .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the propagation of resonantly damped kink mhd waves in both transversely and longitudinally inhomogeneous solar waveguides .",
    "the present work extends the previous investigation by tgv , where longitudinal inhomogeneity was not taken into account . by using the wkb method ,",
    "we have derived general expressions for amplitude and wavelength of kink waves in the tt and tb approximations .",
    "variation of wavelength along the magnetic flux tube only depends on longitudinal stratification .",
    "however , wave amplitude is affected by both transverse and longitudinal inhomogeneity . the kink mode is damped by resonant absorption in the alfvn continuum due to transverse inhomogeneity and the damping length changes along the waveguide since it is dependent on the longitudinal density profile .",
    "however , it is important to note that the ratio of damping length to wavelength along the magnetic flux tube is constant .",
    "it is obvious that the effect of longitudinal inhomogeneity can both amplify or attenuate the wave , depending on whether the density decreases or increases towards the direction of wave propagation , respectively . in the case of radial and longitudinal inhomogeneity",
    "we have shown that the variation of kink mode amplitude along magnetic tubes is determined by the combined effect of both these mechanisms .",
    "we have performed an application of the theory to the case of driven kink waves in stratified coronal loops propagating upward from the loop footpoints . in this model",
    "the density decreases exponentially along the flux tube , and so resonant absorption and longitudinal stratification have opposite effects on the kink wave amplitude . the efficiency of resonant absorption as a damping mechanism depends on the frequency . for frequencies larger than an approximate critical value ,",
    "the net effect is the decrease of the amplitude in @xmath17 . the opposite effect , i.e. , increase of the amplitude , takes place for frequencies smaller than the approximate critical one .",
    "these analytical results have been checked using full numerical simulations beyond the tttb and wkb approximations .",
    "the analytical expressions and the full numerical solution of driven waves are in good agreement even when the requirements of the tttb and wkb approximations are not strictly fulfilled .",
    "the analytical expressions for the wavelength and the amplitude derived in this paper have direct implications for solar magnetoseismology of , e.g. , coronal loops , spicules , and prominence threads , allowing the equilibrium model to have realistic variation in plasma density in both the longitudinal and transverse direction to the magnetic field .",
