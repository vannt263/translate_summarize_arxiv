    "observations of abundances and abundance ratios in stars yield powerful constraints on models of internal processes in stars .",
    "in particular , the predicted abundance evolution of stars of a given mass and metallicity depends on both mixing and nuclear burning processes . while it is customary to provide observational results with some estimate or analysis of the associated errors , this is seldomly done for theoretical abundance predictions .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that quantitative uncertainties on the input physics is not available and that theoretical model uncertainties ( in particular for poorly understood mixing processes ) are hard to make .",
    "finally , a systematic error propagation in stellar models can be computationally demanding and the effort has often not been justified in the past",
    ". however , new spectroscopic observations with unprecedented precision will be available in the near future , and one has the impression that stellar physics in general is entering a new high - precision era . in this context",
    "it seems necessary to reconsider the question of abundance prediction uncertainties in a quantitative way .    as an initial step in this direction",
    ", we have chosen specifically the dependence of oxygen isotopic ratio predictions in giant stars on nuclear reaction rate uncertainties .",
    "the oxygen isotopic ratios are of particular interest because they are affected not only by nucleosynthesis but also by mixing processes which are not yet very well understood .",
    "the latter is evident from the spectroscopic properties of giant stars which are not entirely consistent with standard stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important to quantitatively know the uncertainties arising from nucleosynthesis in order to help constrain mixing processes using observations .",
    "in addition , the oxygen isotope predictions are important for the interpretation of pre - solar corundum ( al@xmath0o@xmath1 ) from meteorites for which oxygen isotopic ratios can be measured with high precision ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    during the main sequence ( ms ) evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars , partial h - burning in the envelope produces @xmath14o , @xmath15c , and @xmath16n while @xmath17c , @xmath18n , and @xmath19o are destroyed ( fig.[fig : abund ] ) .",
    "the abundance of @xmath20o in the envelope is essentially unchanged for stellar mass @xmath11 . for more massive stars , core convection on the early ms reaches out to @xmath21 per cent of the stellar mass , leaving behind core processed material as it retreats , including destroyed @xmath20o ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "evidence of the retreating core convection is seen in the 2 and 3@xmath2 cases in fig.[fig : abund ] at the bottom of the envelope where the h and @xmath20o are depleted .    at the end of the ms phase hydrogen",
    "is exhausted in the core , causing the core to contract and the envelope to expand and cool .",
    "envelope convection descends into the star as the envelope temperature drops .",
    "regions previously affected by cool h - burning are homogenised , leading to a change of surface abundances ( 1@xmath22 dredge - up , 1dup hereafter ) . as a result of this mixing",
    ", theory predicts the @xmath20o/@xmath14o ratio decrease from initially @xmath23 to a few hundred , depending on stellar mass while the @xmath20o/@xmath19o ratio increases only marginally by @xmath24 per cent from the initial value of about 500 , weakly dependent on mass . for many stars ,",
    "this is in fair agreement with spectroscopic observations .",
    "for example , @xcite find for k - giants @xmath25 ratios in the range @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , some corundum oxygen isotopes are in rough agreement with standard 1dup model predictions ( e.g.  seal203 in @xcite has @xmath28 and a solar @xmath4 ratio ) while many others require either non - solar initial @xmath4 ratios @xcite or non - standard mixing processes .    the dependence of oxygen isotopic ratios on the @xmath29 proton capture nuclear reactions has been studied before by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they considered the effect of a new determination of these reactions by @xcite and found that the uncertainty of the @xmath25 predictions is dominated by the uncertainty of these rates for stars with initial masses larger than @xmath30 .    in this paper",
    "we include seven reactions in a systematic analysis of the influence of rate uncertainties on the predicted oxygen isotopic ratios in red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "in addition to addressing this scientific question , we also want to demonstrate and test the method of evaluating model error propagation described here .",
    "2 describes the method and computations . in sect .",
    "3 the uncertainty in the modeled oxygen isotopic ratios of rgb stars is analysed for significant reaction rate uncertainties and comparisons are made to observations and other models .",
    "a summary is in the final section .",
    "the nucleosynthesis and mixing considered here do not alter the structural evolution .",
    "therefore we can efficiently post - process a time sequence of full stellar models to analyse the behaviour of nucleosynthesis and mixing in the envelope under variations of the input nuclear reaction rates .",
    "a sequence is post - processed many times , each time with a different set of values for the reaction rates ( within published uncertainty ) to obtain a monte carlo ( mc ) estimate of error propagation into the surface abundance predictions . in the following subsections we describe the stages of this method in more detail .",
    "a time sequence of stellar models is generated by the _",
    "evol _ code ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "at each time step the four partial differential equations of stellar structure are solved on a 1d lagrangian grid , with the _ opal _ opacity tables from @xcite . a standard nuclear reaction network , including the pp - chains and the cno tri - cycle , is incorporated .",
    "the treatment of mixing , in particular the use of convective overshooting , is not essential to this study because we are interested here in the differential impact of the uncertainties of nuclear reaction rates .",
    "however , there is some agreement that the hydrodynamical properties of convection inevitably result in some turbulent mixing into the neighboring stable layers , defined by the convective boundary where the acceleration of streams disappears . models of convection in the hydrodynamical framework predict that the turbulent velocity field decays roughly exponentially ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the extent of overshooting is not the same at all convective boundaries .",
    "this is evident from hydrodynamical simulations , for example by @xcite who find @xmath31 for the shallow surface convection of a - stars and @xmath32 for white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath33 reproduces the results of @xcite who fitted the observed width of the main sequence with an instantaneous treatment of overshooting of @xmath34 .",
    "this order of magnitude for core convection overshooting was confirmed by 2d hydrodynamical models by @xcite .",
    "for a situation with an extended , deep envelope , like during the first dredge - up , an estimate of overshooting efficiency is more difficult .",
    "@xcite found that the position of the rgb luminosity bump can be aligned with observation with an envelope overshooting three times the value required for the core overshooting ( see , however , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that overshooting at the bottom of the solar convection zone in excess of @xmath35 would cause too much lithium destruction ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . in view of the ambiguous evidence we decided to use the same value as for the main sequence core convection at the bottom of the descending envelope convection during the first dredge - up evolution .",
    "for the core convection we use no overshooting in the 1@xmath2 cases , @xmath36 in the 1.5@xmath2 sequence and @xmath37 for the 2@xmath2 and 3@xmath2 cases . the mixing efficiency in the envelope is chosen to be @xmath38 for all cases .",
    "the reimer s mass loss formulae @xcite with @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 is employed , starting at the bottom of the rgb .",
    "our post - processing code takes the stellar structure from the full stellar evolution model sequences generated by _",
    "evol _ as input and recomputes abundance changes due to nucleosynthesis and mixing .",
    "the code is fully implicit , iterative , and couples mixing with nucleosynthesis using adaptive step size and full error control .",
    "all reactions in the post - processing code use nacre reaction rates @xcite , which include estimates on upper and lower limits .",
    "we have used the electronic web tool _ netgen _",
    "@xcite to retrieve the tabulated rates .",
    "the full network of nuclear reactions is the same as in the full stellar evolution code , but rates for a predefined set of seven reactions were systematically altered .",
    "if one is interested in knowing the abundance uncertainty of a particular species , then inspection of its production and destruction reactions may reveal to which reaction uncertainty the abundance is most sensitive .",
    "for example , @xmath19o is mainly destroyed rather than produced in the envelope .",
    "hence , the surface abundance of @xmath19o after 1dup ought to be most sensitive to the one of the two major reactions which consume it .",
    "reaction @xmath3 has a larger nominal rate than @xmath43 and accordingly this reaction must be most important to @xmath19o .",
    "while such a qualitative consideration is straightforward it is harder to estimate the quantitative effect of the uncertainty of this reaction because the combined effects of @xmath44 and the other reactions when the temperature profile evolves before equilibrium is reached and core convection on the early main sequence may affect the envelope abundances .",
    "manipulating the rates of one reaction that is part of a larger network will not necessarily reveal the whole picture , especially when equilibrium abundances are not achieved .",
    "this is true in particular for a general network situation in which reaction flows may be redirected due to uncertainties of reactions that are involved in branchings . in order to have a tool available which can readily be applied to any nucleosynthesis and mixing scenario we decided to take a general and flexible approach by combining post - process calculations with an mc scheme , as described below . with this approach we could ,",
    "for example , also study more complex situations like the dependence of the @xmath45-process in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars on nuclear reaction rate uncertainties .    for each mc iteration",
    "the reaction rate for reaction @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the upper , nominal , and lower rates respectively .",
    "we choose a gaussian distribution to the random variable @xmath51 which peaks at zero and has an e - folding distance at @xmath52 so that the extreme values are populated at 1.8@xmath53 .",
    "note that while the distribution on @xmath51 is symmetric , the distribution of @xmath54 is not .      with the stellar evolution code we generated seven sequences of stellar structure models for a range of initial mass and metallicity .",
    "each sequence was followed from the beginning of the ms to just after the end of the 1dup .",
    "the stellar model sequences together with the mass coordinate of the deepest penetration of the 1dup ( @xmath55 ) and the maximum temperature achieved at that mass coordinate are listed in table[tbl : cases ] .",
    "the maximum envelope temperature was achieved at about @xmath56 of the ms lifetime for all cases .",
    "the envelopes of the 23@xmath2 cases receive matter from the core due to core convection on the early ms . for these cases , table",
    "[ tbl : cases ] also shows the maximum temperature achieved at the centre of the star ( @xmath57 ) from the beginning of the ms to when the core convection no longer overlaps with the envelope .",
    "these temperatures are the maximum that part of the surface material , after 1dup , was exposed to .",
    "out of the full stellar evolution model sequences about 32 to 36 models for 11.5@xmath2 cases and 82 to 119 models for 23@xmath2 were chosen for post - processing .",
    "the bulk of extra models used in the 23@xmath2 cases were put on the first half of the ms , when core convection was retreating , leaving behind material processed in the core .",
    "at least 4 models were put near the time of deepest 1dup to ensure that a precise mixing depth was achieved .",
    "we post - processed the whole star for 23@xmath2 but only the envelope layers affected by the 1dup for 11.5@xmath2 . in this study",
    "we ignore any extra mixing processes that might occur later on the rgb , like cool bottom processing @xcite .",
    "the choice of stellar cases spans 1@xmath2 to 3@xmath2 with solar metallicity and additional cases for 1@xmath2 and 2@xmath2 where the metallicity is lower . for the lower metallicity cases we have scaled all three oxygen isotopes with z , _ not _ taking into account the anti - correlation of the @xmath58 with z reported by @xcite . to facilitate comparison ,",
    "the initial oxygen isotope ratios were chosen to be @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the same as in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : abund ] shows example abundance profiles produced by the post - processing code using the nominal reaction rates , together with the 1dup mark .",

    "the reduced @xmath20o at the bottom of the envelope , from where core convection retreated , enhances the sensitivity to the maximum depth of the 1dup for the 2@xmath2 and 3@xmath2 cases .",
    "the seven cno cycle reactions which are included in the analysis are listed in table[tbl : reac ] in decreasing order of @xmath61 .",

    "branching off from this series are reactions @xmath3 and @xmath43 , which consume @xmath19o , and @xmath9 , which consumes @xmath14o .",
    "for the 1@xmath2 cases , reaction @xmath12 is slow enough and @xmath20o is abundant enough that the @xmath20o reservoir is effectively not changing in the envelope .",
    "this is not true for 23@xmath2 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : abund ] ) , and therefore reactions @xmath63 and @xmath64 should receive attention in these cases because they affect the production of @xmath20o .",
    "[ fig : rat ] shows the nominal , upper and lower limits on these reaction rates for the relevant temperature range .",
    "the primary result from the mc simulations are quantified model uncertainties in the oxygen isotopic ratios due to reaction rate uncertainties .",
    "secondly , we assess the individual contribution from each of the considered reaction uncertainties on isotopic ratio uncertainties .",
    "an mc simulation was carried out for each of the cases in table [ tbl : cases ] and the results are summarized in table [ tbl : uncer ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : tripleiso ] .",

    "there were 200 iterations for each 11.5@xmath2 case , and at least 400 iterations for each @xmath13 case , which are already more time consuming due to a greater number of input models .",
    "more iterations are needed for the @xmath13 cases because there are 3 instead of 2 influential reaction rate uncertainties .",

    "the distribution of the flagged iterations can reveal the relative importance of the uncertainties of the reactions considered .",
    "symbols for reactions that do not dominate the isotopic uncertainties can appear everywhere in the cloud of points , indicating that a rate far from the nominal value for these reactions does not cause any preferred location in the plot ( reaction @xmath63 for example ) .",
