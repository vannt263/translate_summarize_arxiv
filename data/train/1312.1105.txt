    "solar cycle 24 was predicted to begin in 2008 march ( @xmath0 6 months ) , and peak in late 2011 or mid-2012 , with a cycle length of 11.75 years .",
    "so , the recent paucity of sunspots and the delay in the expected start of solar cycle 24 were unexpected , even though it is well known that solar cycles are challenging to forecast @xcite . since traditional models based on sunspot data require information about the starting and rise times , and",
    "also the shape and amplitude of the cycle , the fine details of a given solar cycle can be predicted accurately only after a cycle has begun ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "many of these models analyze a large number of previous cycles in order to predict the pattern for the new cycle .",
    "in contrast , the technique of helioseismology does not depend on sunspot data and has been used to predict activity two cycles into the future ; this method was used by @xcite to predict that sunspots will cover a larger area of the sun during cycle 24 than in previous cycles , and that the cycle will reach its peak about 2012 , one year later than forecast by alternative methods based on sunspot data ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements of the length of the sunspot cycle show that the cycle varies typically between 10 and 12 years .",
    "moreover , these variations in the cycle length have been associated with changes in the global climate @xcite .",
    "in addition , the maunder minimum illustrates a connection between a paucity of sunspots and cooler than average temperatures on earth .",
    "the length of the sunspot cycle was first measured by heinrich schwabe in 1843 when he identified a 10-year periodicity in the pattern of sunspots from a 17-year study conducted between 1826 and 1843 @xcite . in 1848 ,",
    "rudolph wolf introduced the relative sunspot number , r , organized a program of daily observations of sunspots , and reanalyzed all earlier data to find that the average length of a solar cycle was about 11 yrs . for more than two centuries , solar physicists applied a variety of techniques to determine the nature of the solar cycle .",
    "the earliest methods involved counting sunspot numbers and determining durations of cyclic activity from sunspot minimum to minimum using the `` smoothed monthly mean sunspot number '' @xcite .",
    "the `` group sunspot number '' introduced by @xcite is another well - documented data set and provides comparable results to those derived from relative sunspot numbers .",
    "in addition , sunspot area measurements since 1874 describe the total surface area of the solar disk covered by sunspots at a given time .",
    "the analysis of sunspot numbers or sunspot areas is often referred to as a one - dimensional approach because there is only one independent variable , namely sunspot numbers or areas @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced a new parameter called the `` sunspot unit area '' in an effort to combine the information about the sunspot numbers and sunspot areas to derive the length of the cycle .",
    "there is also a two - dimensional approach in which the latitude of an observed sunspot is introduced as a second independent variable @xcite .",
    "when sunspots first appear on the solar surface they tend to originate at latitudes around 40 degrees and migrate toward the solar equator .",
    "when such migrant activity is taken into account it can be shown that there is an overlap between successive cycles , since a new cycle begins while its predecessor is still decaying .",
    "this overlap became obvious when @xcite published his butterfly diagram and demonstrated the latitude drift of sunspots throughout the cycles .",
    "maunder s butterfly diagram showed that although the length of time between sunspot minima is on average 11 years , successive cycles actually overlap by @xmath1 1 to 2 years .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that there were distinct solar cycles lasting 10 years as well as cycles lasting 12 years .",
    "this type of behavior suggests that there could be a periodic pattern in the length of the sunspot cycle .",
    "a summary of analyses of the sunspot cycle is found in @xcite and a more recent review of the long - term variability is given by @xcite .",
    "sunspot number data collected prior to the 1700 s show epochs in which almost no sunspots were visible on the solar surface .",
    "one such epoch , known as the maunder minimum , occurred between the years 1642 and 1705 , during which the number of sunspots recorded was very low in comparison to later epochs @xcite .",
    "geophysical data and tree - ring radiocarbon data , which contain residual traces of solar activity @xcite , were used to examine whether the maunder period truly had a lower number of sunspots or whether it was simply a period in which little data had been collected or large degrees of errors existed .",
    "these studies showed that the timing of the maunder minimum was fairly accurate because of the high quality of sunspot data during that period , including sunspot drawings , and the dates are strongly correlated with geophysical data .",
    "other epochs of significantly reduced solar activity include the oort minimum from 1010 - 1050 , the wolf minimum from 1280 - 1340 , the sprer minimum from 1420 - 1530 @xcite , and the dalton minimum from 1790 - 1820 @xcite .",
    "these minima have been derived from historical sunspot records , auroral histories @xcite , and physical models which link the solar cycle to dendrochronologically - dated radiocarbon concentrations @xcite .",
    "our interest in predicting flaring activity cycles on cool stars ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) led us to investigate the long - term behavior of the solar cycle since solar flares display a typical average 11-year cycle like sunspots @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the preliminary results of which were published in @xcite and @xcite , we investigate the variations in the length of the sunspot number cycle and examine whether the variability can be explained in terms of a secular pattern .",
    "our analysis can serve as a tutorial .",
    "we apply classical one - dimensional techniques to recalculate the periodicities of solar activity using the sunspot number and area data to provide internal consistency in our analysis of the long - term behavior .",
    "these results are then used as a basis in the subsequent study of the sun s long - term behavior . in ",
    "2 we discuss the source of the data ; in  3 we describe the derivation of the cycle from sunspot numbers and sunspot areas using two independent techniques ; in  4 we examine the variability in the cycle length based on the times of cycle minima and maxima using two independent techniques ; and in  5 we discuss the results .",

    "a maximum test period of 260 years was chosen for all data sets , except in the case of the more extensive yearly sunspot number data when a maximum of 350 years was assumed .",
    "we chose the same maximum test period for the sunspot area analysis for consistency with the sunspot number analysis , even though these test periods are longer than the duration of the area data .",
    "the results from the fft and pdm analyses of sunspot number and sunspot area data are illustrated in figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , corresponding to the daily , monthly , and yearly sunspot numbers and the daily , monthly , and yearly sunspot areas , respectively . in these figures ,",

    "the three averages given in table 3 were determined by averaging the dominant solutions from the fft and pdm analyses for each data set .",
    "the errors in the averages were determined using standard techniques @xcite . while the errors for the sunspot area results are smaller than those for the spot numbers , the area data are actually less accurate than the sunspot number data because the measurement error in the areas may be as high as 30% @xcite .",
    "the higher errors for the area data are related to the difficulty in determining a precise spot boundary .",
    "longer periodicities that could not be eliminated because of relationships with the duration of the data set or other frequencies related to the data ( as described in  3.1 ) were also identified with durations ranging from @xmath190  260 years ( figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] ) .",
    "these long - term periodicities are discussed further in the following section .",
    "the previous analysis of sunspot data provided some evidence of long term cycles in the data .",
    "this secular behavior was studied in greater detail through an analysis of the dates of sunspot minima and maxima from 1610 to 2000 , as shown in table 2 .",
    "since there have been concerns about the difficulty in deriving the exact times of sunspot minima , and the even greater complexity in the determination of the maxima , we derived our results using the cycle minima and maxima separately .",
    "the sunspot cycle lengths were calculated in two ways : ( i ) from the dates of successive cycle minima provided by the ngdc , and ( ii ) from our calculations of cycle lengths derived from the maxima .",
    "these cycle lengths are tabulated in table 2 and plotted in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "the data in figure 5 show substantial variability over time .",
    "the cycle lengths derived from the dates of sunspot minima and maxima were analyzed to search for periodicities in the cycle length using two techniques : ( i ) a median trace analysis and ( ii ) a power spectrum analysis of the ` observed minus calculated ' or ( o - c ) residuals .",
    "median trace analyses have been used to identify hidden trends in scatter plots which , at first glance , display no obvious pattern ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these analyses have also been applied to astronomical data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the method of median trace analysis is applicable to any scatter plot , irrespective of how measurements were obtained , and is one of a general class of smoothing methods designed to identify trends in scatter plots .",
    "a median trace is a plot of the median value of the data contained within a bin of a chosen width , for all bins in the data set @xcite .",
    "a median trace analysis depends on the choice of an optimal interval width ( oiw ) .",
    "these oiws , @xmath30 , were calculated using three statistical methods applied routinely to estimate the statistical density function of the data .",
    "the first method defines the oiw as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the number of data points and @xmath33 , a statistically robust measure of the standard deviation of the data called the mean absolute deviation from the sample median , is defined as    @xmath34    where @xmath11 is the sample median .",
    "the second method defines the oiw as @xmath35 a third definition of the oiw is given by @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the interquartile range of the data set .",
    "optimal bin widths were determined for three data sets corresponding to the cycle lengths derived from the ( i ) cycle minima , ( ii ) cycle maxima , and ( iii ) the combined minima and maxima data .",
    "table 4 lists the solutions for the optimal interval widths ( @xmath38 ) for each data set .",
    "since the values of the optimal bin widths ranged from @xmath160  120 years , we tested the impact of different bin widths on our results .",
    "this procedure was limited by the fact that only 35 sunspot number cycles have elapsed since 1610 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the data set can be increased to 70 points if we analyze the combined values of the length of the solar cycle derived from both the sunspot minima and the sunspot maxima . using our derived oiws as a basis for our analysis",
    ", we calculated median traces for bin widths of 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , and 90 years .",
    "these are illustrated in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "the lower bin widths were included to make maximum use of the limited number of data points , and the higher bin widths were excluded because , once binned , there would be too few data points to make those analyses meaningful .",

    "the least absolute error method @xcite was used to produce the sinusoidal fits to the median trace in each frame of the figure .",
    "these sinusoidal fits illustrate the long - term cyclic behavior in the length of the sunspot number cycle .",
    "the optimal solution was determined by identifying the fits that satisfied two criteria : ( 1 ) the cycle periods deduced from the three data sets should be nearly the same , and ( 2 ) the cyclic patterns should be in phase for the three data sets .",
    "table 5 lists the derived cycle periods for all three data sets : the ( a ) cycle minima , ( b ) cycle maxima , and ( c ) combined minima and maxima data .",
    "the lengths of the sunspot number cycles tabulated by the national geophysical data center ( table 2 & figure [ f5 ] ) show that the basic sunspot number cycle is an average of ( 11.0 @xmath0 1.5 ) years based on the cycle minima and ( 11.0 @xmath0 2.0 ) years based on the cycle maxima .",
    "this schwabe cycle varies over a range from 8 to 15 years if the cycle lengths are derived from the time between successive minima , while the range increases to 7 to 17 years if the cycle lengths are derived from successive maxima .",
    "these variations may be significant even though the data in figure [ f5 ] show _ heteroskedasticity _ , i.e. , variability in the standard deviation of the data over time .",
    "although the range in sunspot cycle durations is large , the cycle length converged to a mean of 11 years , especially after 1818 as the accuracy of the data became more reliable .",
    "in particular , the sunspot number cycle lengths from 1610 - 1750 had a high variance while the cycle durations since 1818 show a much smaller variance ( figure [ f5 ] ) because the data quality was poor in the 18th and early 19th century .",
    "this variance may be influenced by the difficulty in identifying the dates of cycle minima and maxima whenever the sunspot activity is relatively low .",
    "even after the data became more accurate there was still a significant @xmath0 1.5-year range about the 11-year mean .",
    "the range in the length of this cycle suggests that there may be a hidden longer - term variability in the schwabe cycle .",
    "our median trace analysis of the lengths of the sunspot number cycle uncovered a long - term cycle with a duration between 146 and 419 years ( table 5 ) , if the data are binned in groups of 40 to 90 years ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "since the median trace analysis is influenced by the bin size of the data , we determined the optimal bin width based on the goodness of fit between the median trace and the corresponding sinusoidal fit ( see figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "based on the sunspot minima ( the best data set ) , the cycle length was 185 years for the 50-yr bin width , 243 years for the 60-yr bin , 222 years for the 70-yr bin , 393 years for the 80-year bin , and 299 years for the 90-yr bin ; so we found no direct relationship between the bin size and the resulting periodicity .",
    "figure [ f6 ] also shows the median traces for the data and illustrates that the optimal bin width is in the range of 50 - 60 years because it is only in these two cases that the sinusoidal fits are in phase and the derived periods are approximately equal for all three data sets .",
    "the 50-year median trace predicts a 183-year sunspot number cycle , while the 60-year trace predicts a 243-year cycle .",
    "since the observations span @xmath1385 years , there is greater confidence in the 183-year cycle than in the longer one because at least two cycles have elapsed since 1610 .",
    "similar long - term cycles ranging from 169 to 189 years have been proposed for several decades @xcite .",

    "however , an alternative method to derive this secular period is to calculate the power spectrum of the ( o - c ) variation of the dates corresponding to the ( i ) cycle minima , ( ii ) cycle maxima , and ( iii ) the combined minima and maxima .",

    "the variability in the length of the sunspot cycle was examined through a study of archival sunspot data from 1610  2005 . in the preliminary stage of our study , we analyzed archival data of sunspot numbers from 1700 - 2005 and sunspot areas from 1874 - 2005 using power spectrum analysis and phase dispersion minimization .",
    "this analysis showed that the schwabe cycle has a duration of ( 10.80 @xmath0 0.50 ) years ( table 3 ) and that this cycle typically ranges from @xmath110  12 years even though the entire range is from @xmath17  17 years . based on our results ,",
    "we have found evidence to show that ( 1 ) the variability in the length of the solar cycle is statistically significant .",
    "in addition , we predict that ( 2 ) the length of successive solar cycles will increase , on average , over the next 75 years ; and ( 3 ) the strength of the sunspot cycle should eventually reach a minimum somewhere between cycle 24 and cycle 31 , and we make no claims about any specific cycle .",
    "the focus of our study was to investigate whether there is a secular pattern in the range of values for the schwabe cycle length .",
    "we used our derived value for the schwabe cycle from table 3 to examine the long - term behavior of the cycle .",
    "this analysis was based on ngdc data from 16102000 , a period of 386 years ( using sunspot minima ) or 385 years ( using sunspot maxima ) .",
    "the long - term cycles were identified using median trace analyses of the length of the cycle and also from power spectrum analyses of the ( o - c ) residuals of the dates of sunspot minima and maxima .",
    "we used independent approaches because of the inherent uncertainties in deriving the exact times of minima and the even greater complexity in the determination of sunspot maxima .",
    "moreover , we derived our results from both the cycle minima and the cycle maxima .",
    "the fact that we found similar results from the two data sets suggests that the methods used to determine these cycles ( ngdc data ) did not have any significant impact on our results .",
    "the median trace analysis of the length of the sunspot number cycle provided secular periodicities of 183  243 years .",
    "this range overlaps with the long - term cycles of @xmath190  260 years which were identified directly from the fft and pdm analyses of the sunspot number and area data ( figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] ) .",
    "the power spectrum analysis of the ( o - c ) residuals of the dates of minima and maxima provided much clearer evidence of dominant cycles with periods of @xmath45 years , @xmath48 years , and @xmath47 years .",
    "these results are significant because at least two long - term cycles have transpired over the @xmath1385-year duration of the data set .",
    "the derived long - term cycles were compared in figure [ f8 ] with documented epochs of significant declines in sunspot activity , like the oort , wolf , sprer , maunder , and dalton minima @xcite . in this figure ,",
    "the modern sunspot number data were combined with earlier data from 1610 - 1715 @xcite and with reconstructed ( ancient ) data spanning the past 11,000 years @xcite .",
    "these reconstructed sunspot numbers were based on dendrochronologically - dated radiocarbon concentrations which were derived from models connecting the radiocarbon concentration with sunspot number @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed sunspot numbers are consistent with the occurrences of the historical minima ( e.g. , maunder minimum ) .",
    "@xcite found that over the past 70 years , the level of solar activity has been exceptionally strong .",
    "our 188-year periodicity is similar to the 205-year de vries - seuss cycle which has been identified from studies of the carbon-14 record derived from tree rings ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ f8 ] compares the historical and modern sunspot numbers with the derived secular cycles of length ( a ) 183 years (  4.2 ) , ( b ) 243-years (  4.2 ) , and ( c ) 188 years (  4.4 ) .",
    "the first two periodicities were derived from the median trace analysis , while the third one was derived from the power spectrum analysis of the sunspot number cycle ( o - c ) residuals .",
    "the fits for the 183-year periodicity all had the same amplitude , but were moderately out of phase with each other , while the fits for the 243-year periodicity were in phase for all data sets , albeit with different amplitudes .",
    "an examination of frames ( a ) and ( c ) of figure [ f8 ] reveals that the cycle lengths increased during each of the wolf , sprer , maunder , and dalton minima for the 183-year and 188-year cycles . on the other hand , frame ( b )",
    "shows no similar correspondence between the cycle length and the times of historic minima for the 243-year cycle .",
    "therefore , the 183- and 188-year cycles appear to be more consistent with the sunspot number data than the 243-year cycle .",
    "all four historic minima since 1200 occurred during the rising portion of the 183- and 188-year cycles when the length of the sunspot cycle was increasing . according to our analysis , the length of the sunspot cycle was growing during the maunder minimum when almost no sunspots were visible .",
    "given this pattern of behavior , the next historic minimum should occur during the time when the length of the sunspot cycle is increasing ( see fig .",
    "[ f8 ] ) .",
    "the existence of long - term solar cycles with periods between 90 and 200 years is not new to the literature but the nature of these cycles is still not fully understood .",
    "our study of the length of the sunspot cycle shows that there is a dominant periodicity of 188 years related to the basic schwabe cycle and weaker periodicities of @xmath140 and 87 years .",
    "this 188-year period , determined over a baseline of 385 years that spans more than two cycles of the long - term periodicity , should be compared with schwabe s 10-year period that was derived from 17 years ( i.e. , less than two cycles ) of observations @xcite .",
    "our study also suggests that the length of the sunspot number cycle should increase gradually , on average , over the next @xmath175 years , accompanied by a gradual decrease in the number of sunspots .",
    "this information should be considered in cycle prediction models ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) to provide better estimates of the starting time of a given cycle .",
