    "spin ice are ferromagnetic frustrated rare - earth materials with pyrochlore structure @xcite .",
    "the rare earth ions are located at the corners of tetrahedrons , and due to the anisotropy their magnetic moments can point only in the two possible orientations in the direction that connects the corner to the center of the tetrahedron - acting like ising spin variables .",
    "the exchange and dipolar interactions between the magnetic moments , as well as the geometry of the structure , impose the so called ice rule - at the ground state , two of the spins located at the corners point inward and the two other spins point outward each tetrahedron .",
    "spin ice materials present also excitations ( violation of this 2-in , 2-out ice rule ) that behaves like magnetic monopoles @xcite , rising both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite interest in the study of the system .    as the spin - orbit coupling is large in rare - earth ions , the interactions on a spin ice structure",
    "is dominated by the exchange interaction @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , the dipolar long range interactions are comparable in magnitude , and also plays a significant role in the description of the system , so spin ice is usually described by an effective pyrochlore ising model @xcite that includes both exchange and dipolar interactions . in a simplified version of the the spin ice model , the dipolar coefficient is set to zero , and the exchange interaction is considered only between nearest neighbors .",
    "this simplified version is referred as the nearest neighbor spin ice model ( nnsi ) @xcite , and was employed to the qualitative description of several properties of spin ice materials .",
    "belonging to a different class of materials , but with some similar properties , two - dimensional spin ices are artificial structures , litographically assembled , constituted by elongated permalloy nano - islands @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moments of the nano - islands are , due to the islands shape anisotropy , constricted to point on the direction of the longest axis @xcite .",
    "again , magnetic moments behave as ising spin variables , being referred only as spins . if the geometry of the array is a two - dimensional square lattice , in which the islands alternate in orientation along the @xmath0 and @xmath1 axis , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sjk](a ) , the system is denominated a two - dimensional square spin ice .",
    "exchange interactions are not present , due to the dimensions of the nano - islands and lattice spacing , providing a classical character to the phenomena here studied , but the dipolar long range interactions is still present and it is responsible for the two - dimensional version of the ice rule - at the ground state , in each vertex of the array of nano - islands , two spins point in the direction of the vertex and two others point in the opposite direction .",
    "also these two - dimensional spin ice systems are subject of great interest , and several studies on the thermodynamics and dynamics of the system and its excitations - the magnetic monopoles - are conducted @xcite .    in a recent work ,",
    "xie , du , yan and liu @xcite used a nearest neighbors model to study phase transitions in a square two - dimensional spin ice , in the context of the conserved monopoles algorithm @xcite , to analyze the thermodynamics of monopoles in an ensemble with fixed monopole density .",
    "the authors consider first a model hamiltonian presenting the exchange interactions between the nearest neighbors spin pairs as well as the long range dipolar interaction .",
    "this model hamiltonian can represent both the artificial two - dimensional square spin ice , lithographically constructed , and also the square spin ice mapping obtained from the projection of the three - dimensional tetrahedral lattice of the pyrochlore spin ice on a plane @xcite . since spin frustration comes from the nearest neighbors interactions , this hamiltonian is then reduced to an effective nearest neighbors hamiltonian given by @xmath2 where the sum runs over the nearest neighbors spin pairs and @xmath3 is the effective coupling that include both exchange and dipolar interactions and assume different values for the two different alignments of the pair of spins ( perpendicular or parallel ) .",
    "following the denomination employed for the nearest neighbors spin ice model , we will refer to this model as the nearest neighbors two - dimensional spin ice model ( nn2dsi ) .    in the present work we will use an extension of the nn2dsi model to study the thermodynamics of the two dimensional square spin ice in the canonical ensemble and compare its results to those obtained by considering the long range character of the dipolar interaction , presented in references @xcite .",
    "there , the authors used monte carlo simulations to develop a study of the thermodynamics of the model , including the interaction between all the pairs of spins on finite lattices , with periodic boundary conditions treated by the ewald summation technique @xcite or with open boundary conditions",
    ". these approaches , of course , made the results more precise , but with the cost of increasing the computational efforts .",
    "the extension of the model we present here will consider a set of eight spins as the nearest neighbors of a given spin , in contrast with the six nearest neighbors of the nn2dsi model @xcite , for the reasons we will present in section [ sri ] .",
    "also in section [ sri ] , we will show that the major influence on a reference spin comes from this set of eight neighbors , in comparison to the influence of all the other spins on the lattice , justifying the use of the nn2dsi model as an effective model for two - dimensional spin ice . in section [ nn2dsi ]",
    "we define the model hamiltonian to the extension of the nn2dsi model employed here . in section [ nr ]",
    "we present the numerical results of our monte - carlo simulations , including the phase transition from the ordered to the disordered phase and the behavior of the density of monopoles and strings on the lattice as a function of the temperature .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the dipolar interaction between the permalloy nano - islands on the artificial two - dimensional spin ice model can be described by the dipolar hamiltonian given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dipole coupling coefficient , with @xmath6 the permeability of the vacuum , @xmath7 the magnetic moment of each spin .",

    "the notation we adopt here has the advantage of allowing the reference to each point of confluence of four spins ( the vertexes where we can introduce magnetic monopoles ) by the index @xmath17 . at the same time , the same index locate the four spins adjacent to this vertex , given by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    .",

    "this set of eight nearest neighbors surrounds the reference spin as a two dimensional shell , so we will refer to the sets of spins at a given distance of the reference spin as shells . for example , the set of sixteen next - nearest neighbors , indicated in red in figure [ shells](b ) , will be referred as the second shell of spins and so on .",
    "the number of spins on a given shell is equal to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the index of the shell , and the relative distance @xmath24 of the spins on the shell to the reference spin grows with @xmath23 , being @xmath25 for the spins located at the edges of the shell .",
    "the influence on a specific spin due its eight nearest neighbors relative to the influence of all the other spins on the lattice can be easily computed by means of the following process .",
    "let us compute the energy cost of flipping one single spin , @xmath26 , from the ground state , due to its nearest neighbors .",
    "considering the geometry of the lattice , and computing the contribution to the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) coming from the spin @xmath20 by means of @xmath27 where the sum in @xmath28 is taken over the nearest neighbors of @xmath8 , one can find that this variation of the energy is given by @xmath29 @xmath30 since @xmath31 .",
    "the same process can be employed to compute now the energy cost relative to the contribution of the next - nearest neighbors , the second shell of spins surrounding @xmath32 , as shown in figure [ shells](b ) , resulting in @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "note the alternating sign of each contribution as we go from one shell to the next one . by proceeding this way for the third shell of spins , as well as for the fourth , fifth and so on ,",
    "we obtain the result depicted in figure [ figexshell ] , in which we observe the rapid decay of the energy contribution ( in absolute values ) of the coupling of each shell with the reference spin to the total energy of the system ( closed circles with dashed line ) .",
    "this rapid decay is due to the @xmath35 decay law of the dipolar interaction as well as to the alternating sign of the spins on a given shell .",
    "if all the contributions of the spins on a given shell acted on the same direction , one should expect that the energy relative to that shell would decrease as @xmath36 , since , as we have seen , the number of spins on the @xmath23-th shell grows with @xmath23 and the strength of the interaction decreases with @xmath35 , with @xmath37 .",

    "the influence of the shells decays faster than this reference decay .",
    "full squares : the cumulative contribution to the energy cost of flipping the reference spin from the first up to the n - th shell . ]    also in fig .",
    "[ figexshell ] we show the cumulative energy cost by flipping the reference spin ( @xmath38 ) as we consider the joint influence of a greater number of shells ( gray squares ) .",
    "here , the alternating sign of each shell contribution tends to partially cancel each other as we go further on including new shells , and contributes to the fast convergence of @xmath38 .",
    "we can see that the energy difference by considering only the first shell or up to the 10th shell is very small .",
    "in fact , by considering only the first shell , @xmath38 is given by eq .",
    "( [ de1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath39 . by adding the contribution of the second shell , eq .",
    "( [ de2 ] ) , the result changes to @xmath40 .",
    "after including the contributions of the first 20 shells , one obtain @xmath41 .",
    "as we can see , the contribution coming from the nearest neighbors is very close from the total energy variation computed after including 20 shells .",
    "the contribution from the first shell of neighbors ( nearest neighbors ) is only @xmath42 greater than the convergence value , @xmath43 .",
    "since the major contribution to the energy change as we flip a given spin comes from its coupling to the nearest neighbors , it seems to be a reasonable approximation to compute only the contributions of these neighbors spins .",
    "of course , better approaches could be constructed by considering the next - nearest neighbors and so on , but with the cost of complexity and increasing computational time .",
    "so , the nearest neighbors two dimensional spin ice model ( nn2dsi ) @xcite can be useful to describe , at least qualitatively , the major features of the two dimensional square spin ice and , as a toy model , the phenomena relative to the pyrochlore three dimensional real spin ice .",
    "furthermore , we can estimate the errors involved on the nearest neighbors approach in comparison with the long range dipolar interaction model by considering the ratio between the energy costs evaluated above , @xmath44 , with @xmath45 standing for the long range dipolar model and @xmath46 for the nearest neighbors approach .",
    "since @xmath38 is expressed in units of the dipolar coupling @xmath47 , the exact energy variation could be recovered from the nearest neighbors result by replacing the dipolar coupling by an effective dipolar coupling @xmath48 .",
    "thus , we can consider the replacing of @xmath47 by @xmath49 on the nearest neighbors model results as a first correction to our results .",
    "on the nearest neighbors approach we are dealing with here , each spin at each sub - lattice couples with the four nearest neighbors of the same sub - lattice , with different couplings , however , due to the alignment of the spins and to the structure of the dipolar coupling presented in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "so , the coupling between two @xmath50 neighbor spins on the horizontal direction is @xmath51 , while the coupling of two @xmath50 spins on the vertical direction is @xmath47 .",
    "the contribution to the hamiltonian of the coupling of a specific spin @xmath17 on the horizontal sub - lattice with its four nearest neighbors in a @xmath13 square spin ice lattice is given by @xmath52 with a equivalent expression for the contribution of an spin on the vertical sub - lattice , @xmath53 . here , and",
    "in what follows , we have already included a factor @xmath54 in order to avoid double counting on the evaluation of @xmath55 .",
    "each spin of a given sub - lattice also couples to the four nearest spins of the other sub - lattice , as represented in figure [ shells](a ) . in our convention",
    "we assign the same indexes to a given @xmath50 spin and its nearest @xmath56 neighbor at the lower - left position , as exemplified in figure [ sjk](b ) .",
    "then , the contribution to the hamiltonian of the coupling of an specific @xmath17 spin on the horizontal sub - lattice with its four vertical @xmath56 nearest neighbors is given by @xmath57 and the contribution of a spin on the vertical sub - lattice with its four horizontal neighbors is @xmath58 finally , the nearest neighbors hamiltonian to the artificial two - dimensional square spin ice is given by @xmath59 where the sum runs over @xmath60 .",

    "so , in this approach , we can obtain faster results and/or employ larger lattices , allowing to obtain qualitative results for several observables on the square spin ice as an insightful scenario for studying dynamic and thermodynamic phenomena in both artificial two - dimensional and real three - dimensional spin ice models .",
