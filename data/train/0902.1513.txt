    "besides the differences in terms of geometry , the lid - driven cubical cavity flow @xcite and the cylindrical swirling flow investigated in this article , present similar features typical of shear - driven recirculating flows such as intense wall - jets , shear layers in the vicinity of the driven wall , and secondary recirculating flows , all of which are very dependent on the flow parameters . nevertheless , the geometry ",
    "cubical on one hand and cylindrical on the other hand  dramatically influences the nature and structure of these secondary flows : corner eddies for the cubical cavity and recirculation bubbles or vortex breakdown in the cylindrical case .",
    "following the pioneering work of bogatyrev & gorin @xcite and koseff & street @xcite , it was shown that contrary to intuition , the lid - driven _ cubical _ cavity flow is essentially three - dimensional , even when considering large aspect ratio .",
    "it is only recently that the three - dimensionality of the lid - driven _ cylindrical _ cavity flow was confirmed numerically by blackburn & lopez @xcite after it was suggested but not fully proved experimentally by srensen @xcite , spohn  @xcite , sotiropoulos & ventikos @xcite , and pereira & sousa @xcite . in 2001 ,",
    "sotiropoulos & ventikos @xcite gave full experimental evidence of the three - dimensional character of the flow with the onset of non - axisymmetric modes .",
    "the three - dimensional nature of these driven cavity flows therefore appears as a general characteristic of internal recirculating shear - driven flows .    in the sequel",
    ", we will only consider the cylindrical lid - driven cavity flow also referred to as `` swirling '' flow without any additional precision .",
    "the first experiments by vogel @xcite and later ronnenberg @xcite showed that ekman suction and pumping , induced by the ekman layers on the rotating and stationary disks , lead to the formation of a concentrated vortex core along the axis in the closed cavity case .",
    "the two dimensionless numbers characterizing this flow are the height - to - radius aspect ratio @xmath0 and the reynolds number @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the height and radius of the cylinder respectively , @xmath4 the constant angular velocity of the bottom end - wall , and @xmath5 the kinematic viscosity of the newtonian fluid . for specific values of the aspect ratio @xmath6 , and above a critical reynolds number ,",
    "the vortex core breaks down in the form of one or more recirculation bubbles which are on - axis in the closed cavity case and on- or off - axis in the open cavity case . owing to the enormous extent of work in the area of vortex breakdown ( vb ) , ( see reviews by hall @xcite , leibovich @xcite , shtern & hussain @xcite , kerswell @xcite , and arndt @xcite )",
    ", we will only briefly recall the central features of vb .",
    "as defined by leibovich in its review on the structure of vortex breakdown @xcite , the term `` vortex breakdown '' refers to a disturbance characterized by the formation of an internal stagnation point on the vortex axis , followed by reversed flow in a region of limited axial extent .",
    "two forms of vortex breakdown predominate , one called `` near - axisymmetric '' ( sometimes `` axisymmetric '' or `` bubble - like '' ) , and the other called `` spiral '' .",
    "the practical importance of vortex breakdown lies mainly in the field of aeronautics , where they can be observed over wings",
    " mainly delta wings  with highly swept leading edges when the angle of incidence exceeds a critical value .",
    "vortex breakdown can be a limiting factor on the operating altitude of slender - winged flying vehicles .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of vb in the wake of a large aircraft is relevant to the safety of flight in dense air - traffic , which is becoming more and more frequent with the constant increase in air - traffic over the years .",
    "vb is also important in other fields for example it has been observed in the swirling flows through nozzles and diffusers @xcite , and in the field of reactive flows , in combustion chambers . besides the tremendous importance of vb in engineering applications , it is also a prototypical phenomenon allowing to elucidate the fundamental aspects of the bubble mode .",
    "the first comprehensive experimental study of the closed cylindrical container case was undertaken by escudier @xcite , and escudier & keller @xcite , who extended the earlier results of vogel @xcite and ronnenberg @xcite to obtain the first map of vb transitions with respect to the aspect ratio @xmath6 and the reynolds number .",
    "escudier @xcite revealed flow states with one , two or even three successive breakdowns , as well as a transition from steadiness to unsteadiness .",
    "srensen @xcite extended to a broader range of reynolds number in the same experiment as escudier @xcite for the closed container , and inferred that above a critical reynolds number in the unsteady flow regime , the meridional flow becomes highly asymmetric .",
    "the first experimental study of the open cylindrical container case with a free surface on the top , was undertaken by spohn  @xcite , who highlighted the significant change in the structure , the occurrence and the location of the breakdown bubbles . in the steady closed cylinder case ,",
    "hourigan  @xcite investigated the asymmetric spiraling effects along the cylinder axis prior to the first vortex breakdown .",
    "they argued that the observed asymmetry was purely an experimental artifact and not an evidence of the three - dimensional nature of the flow .",
    "spohn  @xcite were the first to investigate experimentally the origin of possible asymmetric features of the instabilities at their onset .",
    "the steady breakdown bubbles reported by spohn  @xcite showcase asymmetric features comparable to earlier measurements , and also to unsteady bubbles observed in circular diffusers by faler & leibovich @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the work of spohn @xcite is really a pioneering work in the acceptance of the axisymmetry breaking , amongst fluid experimentalists , see brns  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy at this point , that the complex physics associated with these intricate phenomena occurring in closed / open rotating cylindrical container is still not clearly understood .    like for the lid - driven cubical cavity flow , and in relation with the simple geometry of the flow",
    ", the rotating cylindrical cavity flow has been extensively studied using direct numerical simulations .",
    "it is important to note that since the early seventies , the method of choice has consisted in solving the streamfunction - vorticity formulation of the axisymmetric incompressible navier  stokes equations . without being exhaustive",
    ", the following list of references gives an overview of the numerical simulation of the closed lid - driven cylindrical flow over three decades : pao @xcite , lugt & haussling @xcite , dijkstra & van heijst @xcite , lugt & abboud @xcite , neitzel @xcite , daube & srensen @xcite , lopez @xcite , brown & lopez @xcite , lopez & perry @xcite , srensen & christensen @xcite , watson & neitzel @xcite , gelfgat  @xcite , tsitverblit & kit @xcite , and brns @xcite .",
    "all these works were able to reproduce with a reasonable accuracy , the basic features observed experimentally and reported earlier including the size , shape and number of recirculation bubbles .",
    "the onset of vortex breakdown was to some extent captured by several of these numerical simulations .",
    "lopez @xcite , and brown & lopez @xcite suggested a physical mechanism for the intricate phenomena observed .",
    "they prove the existence of a standing centrifugal wave , whose amplitude increases with the reynolds number and which can create a stagnation point on the cylinder axis , initiating the breakdown process .",
    "it is worth recalling that the streamfunction - vorticity formulation is adequate and appropriate only for the study of flow dynamics preserving the property of axisymmetry . at the inception of any instability breaking the axisymmetry of the flow , a three - dimensional solution of the navier ",
    "stokes equations is required , thereby increasing considerably the complexity of the task .",
    "the last remark justifies the observed changes in terms of numerical modeling of lopez group and srensen s group , to allow them to investigate axisymmetry breaking in the closed cylinder case @xcite .",
    "therefore , three - dimensional flow structures have started being simulated more recently , see gelfgat  @xcite , sotiropoulos & ventikos @xcite , sotiropoulos @xcite , marques & lopez @xcite , blackburn & lopez @xcite , serre & bontoux @xcite , blackburn @xcite , and lopez @xcite .",
    "apart from the canonical case with a single driving lid in rotation at a constant angular velocity , different variations of the problem have been extensively studied in the past years :  cylinder with co- and counter - rotating end - covers by brns  @xcite , steady axisymmetric flow in an open cylindrical container with a partially rotating bottom wall by piva & meiburg @xcite , vortex scenario and bubble generation in a cylindrical cavity with rotating top and bottom by okulov @xcite .",
    "mullin  @xcite also included a rod at the axis to control the breakdown , and pereira & sousa @xcite significantly changed the configuration by replacing the flat rotating bottom cover by a cone .",
    "as noted by brns  @xcite , all these studies show a large set of flow structures which are quite sensitive to variations of external parameters .",
    "mununga  @xcite and lo  jacono  @xcite investigated different strategies for the control of vortex breakdown .",
    "the focus in the present article is on the canonical problem of a cylinder with a rotating bottom end - wall but replacing the stationary solid top end - wall by a free surface .",
    "the flow associated with this problem was first studied experimentally by spohn @xcite .",
    "they observed the influence of the top free surface  assuredly clean of surfactants  on the onset , structure , nature and number of recirculating bubbles .",
    "their central observations are that breakdown bubbles still appear , but are off - axis and may be attached to the free surface , depending on the aspect ratio @xmath6 and the reynolds number .",
    "of course , such structures could not be observed in the closed case because of the no - slip condition imposed on the top wall .",
    "all the past simulations of free - surface swirling flows rely on the central assumptions that the free surface is flat and clean , which means that the froude number is very small and that surface tension effects are negligible . with these assumptions ,",
    "the flow is identical to the flow in the lower half part of a cylinder with two solid covers in co - rotation , rotating at the same angular velocity .",
    "brns  reported a wide range of topologies of vortex breakdown bubbles in a bottom - driven cylinder with a free surface .",
    "valentine & jahnke @xcite , observed in their simulations the existence of one or two toroidal - like types of recirculation bubble having their stagnation lines attached to the free surface , depending on the value of the reynolds number .",
    "their study was complemented by the work of lopez @xcite for oscillating unsteady flows .",
    "information relevant to the present problem with a free surface all indicate consistent flow behavior at small aspect ratio , @xmath7 in that stagnation occurs off - axis and associated secondary flow creates a toroidal recirculation bubble .",
    "steady free - surface flows have been computed by iwatsu @xcite providing flow state classifications with new flow patterns not revealed in the previous studies .",
    "the present study is motivated by several factors .",
    "firstly , compared to the closed cylinder case , only some limited aspects of the open swirling flow have been investigated so far .",
    "the study of this intricate problem is relatively new and consequently the body of knowledge in some @xmath8-parameter regions appears fairly limited .",
    "secondly , most of the past studies involving numerical simulations of this free - surface swirling flow , used axisymmetric streamfunction - vorticity formulations : brns @xcite , iwatsu @xcite , and piva & meiburg @xcite . to our knowledge , the only fully three - dimensional numerical simulations is due to lopez @xcite , who investigated mainly symmetry breaking issues .    in the present article ,",
    "new flow states are investigated based on a fully three - dimensional solution of the navier ",
    "stokes equations without the need to resort to symmetry properties by doubling the computational domain and enforcing co - rotation of both end - walls . to our knowledge",
    ", the present study provides the most general available results for this flat - free - surface problem .",

    "a legendre spectral element method is used to provide an accurate solution of the governing equations , while the stress - free boundary condition is naturally enforced into the weak formulation of the problem .    the mathematical model and the problem formulation are detailed in sec .

    "[ fig : sketch ] . without adequate treatment",
    ", this discontinuous behavior will undermine the convergence and the accuracy of any numerical method in the vicinity of the lid .",
    "the same remedy as in the lid - driven cubical cavity problem in @xcite is used here for the same reasons and with analogous justifications .",

    "the grid refinement , in terms of spectral element distribution near the disk will be presented in greater details in sec .",
    "[ sec : computational ] .",
    "one of the constraint in the grid design is to ensure the proper resolution of the lid velocity distribution by the spectral element decomposition .",
    "the analysis of a two - phase flow is based on the coupled hydrodynamics interactions between adjacent layers over a broad range of space and time scales .",
    "this analysis can be significantly simplified if the dynamics of the interface is almost entirely dependent  from the hydrodynamics and physico - chemistry viewpoints  on one phase ,  a liquid phase , and almost independent of the dynamics of the second phase ,  a gas phase .",
    "based on this hypothesis , the surface is said to be _",
    "free_. consequently , the two fluid phases can only exert constant normal stresses .",
    "sarpkaya in his review entitled `` vorticity , free surface and surfactants '' @xcite gives a clear characterization and definition of a free surface : `` although , the exterior of a free surface is free from externally imposed shear , the interior is not necessarily free from the shear generated internally .",
    "in fact , surface deformations and contaminants give rise to surface - gradients and tangential stresses in the internal side of the bounding interface . from a mathematical viewpoint",
    ", a free surface means that the density and the viscosity of the upper fluid are zero and that the existence of a continuum above the interface is inconsequential . from a practical point of view",
    ", the free surface means that the dynamics of the continuum above the interface has negligible influence on the lower phase ,  a free surface is a simplifying approximation for an _ almost free surface_. ''    in the present study , the modeling of the interface between the fluids in the cylindrical cavity as a free surface is supplemented by an additional simplifying approximation : the free surface is supposed to remain flat and fixed all along the dynamic range of investigation . in general , the dynamics of the free surface depends on the non - dimensional froude number defined here as @xmath32 which measures the relative importance of the inertial effects compared to the stabilizing gravitational effects .",
    "therefore , assuming a flat free surface corresponds mathematically to a froude number identically zero .",
    "as a consequence and in consistency with the latter assumption , the axial component of the velocity @xmath33 needs to vanish at the free surface @xmath34 @xmath35 thereby expressing the kinematic boundary condition at the free surface .",
