    "muon inelastic scattering off nuclei plays an important role in muon propagation through matter . in this process muon",
    "may loss a significant part of its energy and can be scattered at large angle .",
    "therefore , muon - nucleus inelastic scattering is of interest for numerous applications related to muon transport in matter , in particular , for calculations of muon intensity at large depth of matter , muon - induced hadron flux underground , background produced by atmospheric muons in underground neutrino experiments , etc .",
    "several models [ 1 - 4 ] have been developed to describe the muon - nuclear inelastic interactions , nonetheless uncertainties of this process are much larger than for purely electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the reason is that the bulk of this process is characterized by low squared four - momentum transfer @xmath1 .",
    "the smallness of the @xmath1 does not allow to use of the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) for calculation of nuclear structure function ( sf ) and phenomenological models such as the regge or general vector dominance model ( gvdm ) have to be used .",
    "the parameterization of the nucleon sf obtained in these models , depends on free parameters which can be determined from a fit of experimental data and can be applied in the range of @xmath4 gev@xmath5 .",
    "this range is often referred to as photo - production .",
    "however , they fail to describe deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data at high @xmath1 .",
    "the pqcd ( nlo qcd ) gives a good description of the structure functions at @xmath6 gev@xmath5 .",
    "so , a model to combine various aspects of these approaches is needed to describe the @xmath1 behavior of nucleon sfs over complete range from photo - production to dis .",
    "the widely used approximation [ 4 ] of the muon photo - nuclear cross - section was obtained twenty years ago in the framework of gvdm .",
    "experimental data in the region of @xmath7 gev@xmath5 and @xmath8 were used for determing the parameters . recently , precise data [ 5 ] on sf in wide ranges of @xmath1 ( @xmath9 gev@xmath5 ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) have been obtained and new nuclear effects ( anti - shadowing and emc - effect ) were observed .",
    "the main goal of this work is the calculation of the muon - nucleus inelastic cross - section , based on the modern nucleon sf and on the present knowledge of nuclear effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we give the general relations and definitions used for description of neutral current charged lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "the procedure of the calculation of nucleon sf , using ckmt regge model ckmt [ 6 ] and mrs99 parton distribution function ( pdf ) [ 7 ] is described in sec.3 . in sec.4 , nuclear effects and their parameterization are described .",
    "the total cross - section , the muon energy losses , and the angular distributions of scattered muons are given in sec.5 . in the conclusion",
    "we summarize the main results of the paper .",
    "the cross - section of neutral current charged lepton scattering off nucleon @xmath11 is given by the sum of contributions from the processes as shown in fig.1 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are initial and final lepton four - momenta , @xmath14 is the virtual photon and z - boson momentum , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the initial nucleon momentum and the total momentum of the final hadrons @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "this process can be described by the four - momentum transfered @xmath1 , bjorken @xmath2 and lepton s energy loss @xmath18 ( or inelasticity @xmath19 ) defined as @xmath20 in laboratory system @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are nucleon and lepton masses , respectively .",
    "the general form of the differential cross - section for scattering of charge non - polarized lepton on non - polarized nucleon , summed over the final lepton polarizations can be expressed as : @xmath24 ,                   \\ ] ] where @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28\\frac{1}{\\nu } \\nonumber\\\\ & & y_3=\\big(e-\\nu\\big ) .                   \\ ] ] here the term @xmath29 accounts for the z@xmath30 propagator is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fermi constant , @xmath33 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath34 is z - boson mass .",
    "the constants of lepton weak coupling @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is weinberg angle .",
    "the functions @xmath39 are the electromagnetic ( @xmath40-exchange ) and neutral current ( @xmath41-exchange ) structure functions , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath42 correspond to decomposition over invariant functions of the tensor ( @xmath40-@xmath41 interference ) @xmath43 the upper sign in eq.(6 ) and eq.(7 ) corresponds to lepton scattering ( @xmath44 ) , and the lower sign is for antilepton(@xmath45 ) scattering .",
    "the term proportional to the function @xmath46 , is due to interference between the electromagnetic scattering amplitude and the axial - vector current weak interaction amplitude .",
    "the amplitudes have opposite @xmath47 parities , so the corresponding terms have opposite sings for lepton and antilepton scattering . at low @xmath1",
    "the @xmath48 interference term is much smaller then the @xmath40-exchange one , but it increases linearly with @xmath1 ( eq.(9 ) ) and becomes comparable with the @xmath40-exchange term at @xmath4910@xmath50 gev@xmath5 .    in terms of parton distributions in lo - approximation , the sfs can be written as @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 here @xmath59 and @xmath60 are parton distribution functions in the proton , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the charge , vector and axial - vector week couplings of quarks . for up - quarks ( u , c ,",
    "t ) they are @xmath64 and for down - quarks ( d , s , b ) @xmath65 it is seen from eqs.(4 ) and ( 9 ) that the main contribution to the total cross - section is due to photo - production ( low @xmath1 process ) , however at fixed outgoing muon energy the large scattering angle corresponds to high @xmath1 @xmath66 so , for calculation of muon scattering at large angles it is necessary to know the behavior of the nucleon sfs in the wide range of @xmath67 gev@xmath5 .",
    "at high-@xmath1 the qcd predictions for the nucleon sfs are obtained by solving the dglap evolution at nlo approximation in @xmath68 or dis schemes .",
    "these equations yield the parton distribution functions at all values of @xmath1 provided that the pdf are given as a function of @xmath2 at some input scale @xmath69=1.2 - 5 gev@xmath5 .",
    "the latest global fits performed by several group ( mrs99 [ 7 ] , grv98 [ 8 ] , and cteq5 [ 9 ] ) give a good description of the experimental data . at @xmath1 below @xmath70",
    "perturbative qcd fails to describe data and phenomenological non - perturbative ( gvdm or regge ) models are required .",
    "a considerable number of non - perturbative models have been developed [ 10]-[12 ] recently .",
    "these models predict a correct limit of @xmath0 at @xmath1=0 and give a good description of the sfs at low and medium @xmath1 .",
    "thus , neither the non - perturbative approaches nor pqcd can be expected to describe the @xmath1 behavior of the sfs over the complete the range from photo - production to dis . a number of models combining qcd and phenomenological approaches have been developed to describe data in the transition region of @xmath1 ( see review [ 13 ] ) . in this paper",
    "we use the ckmt model [ 6 ] at low and moderate @xmath1 and the mrs99 fit of pdf [ 7 ] at high-@xmath1 .",
    "the ckmt model proposes the following parameterization of the proton structure function @xmath71 @xmath72 the singlet term @xmath73 corresponds to the pomeron contribution which determines the small-@xmath2 behavior of sea quarks and gluons .",
    "the dependence of effective intercept of the pomeron , @xmath74 on @xmath1 is parametrized as @xmath75 the @xmath76 behavior of @xmath77 is determined by the function @xmath78 the parameterization for the non - singlet term which corresponds to the secondary ( @xmath79,@xmath80 ) reggion ( valent quark ) contribution , is @xmath81 where behavior at @xmath82 is determined by the secondary reggion intercept @xmath83",
