    "if the spatial resolution of the observation is reduced , the emergent stokes profiles @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are averaged over the corresponding resolution element . at the disk center ,",
    "the @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath10 signals are therefore generally degraded because of cancellation of the positive and negative signals coming from different regions of the atmosphere .",

    "three seconds of arc can therefore be regarded as a characteristic spatial scale of the polarized structures seen at the center of the ly@xmath0 line . we can therefore argue that unless the spatial resolution of the observation is significantly better than 3 arcseconds , the polarization of the emergent radiation will be a mixture of signals coming from locations having significantly different plasma structures .",
    "likewise , we can expect that for inferring the average properties of the solar tr , the spatial resolution of a single observation should be much worse than 3 arcseconds , so that the influence of the local inhomogeneities is sufficiently reduced .    for the case of a disk - center observation",

    "nevertheless , in addition to the important goal of measuring for the first time scattering polarization in a fuv line ( hydrogen ly@xmath0 ) whose core originates in the solar tr , clasp can still aim at constraining the average magnetization of the tr by partial spectrum averaging along the spectrograph slit .    an important question to consider",
    "is whether the spectrograph s slit , which selects solar light along a distance of @xmath125 on the solar disk ( i.e. , almost one half of the apparent solar radius ) , should be oriented radially or tangentially with respect to the solar limb , in order to maximize the chances of detection of the expected scattering polarization in ly@xmath0 and the scientific output of the clasp experiment .",
    "we dedicate this section to analyze the pros and cons of both options . although both options seem to be suitable for detecting the scattering polarization signals , we have some reasons to prefer the radial option ( see below ) .",
    "we begin our analysis by considering the case of tangential orientation of the spectrograph s slit , with its center located at the heliocentric angle @xmath85 , i.e. , at an on - disk position where the spatially - averaged @xmath78 signal is maximal ( cf . fig .  [",
    "fig : clvav ] ) .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the spatially - averaged @xmath78 line - center signal on the length @xmath126 ( in arc seconds ) along the slit s direction over which we average the computed stokes @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 signals .",
    "we have done this analysis by averaging the individual signals corresponding to a large number of randomly positioned virtual slits on top of the 3d model grid .",
    "this has been done by selecting randomly the @xmath127 $ ] point that corresponds to the first point of the slit .",
    "the average is then obtained by integration of the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 signals along the randomly selected slit .",
    "if the virtual slit crosses the model s boundary , then the integration continues along the same direction but starting at the opposite boundary , with a random position along this boundary .",
    "this way , it is possible to obtain slit - integrated signals for a large number of slits that are longer than the model s dimensions ( which is about @xmath128 ) . we have applied this procedure for averaging lengths between @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdet ] for three different degrees of the model s magnetization .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the spatialy - averaged @xmath78 signal depends on @xmath126 : stronger signals are found , on average , for smaller lengths @xmath126 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath78 depends on correlations between @xmath15 and @xmath14 at particular pixels . in our 3d model ,",
    "the regions with lower line intensity are , on average , more polarized than the high - intensity regions . consequently",
    ", stronger signals are obtained for smaller lengths @xmath126 .",
    "the spread of the resulting @xmath78 signals is indicated by the error bars in the figure , which correspond to the standard deviation of each @xmath78 value for any given length @xmath126 . as expected , the larger @xmath126 , the smaller the spread of the values . averaging over the whole @xmath118 distance of the clasp spectrograph s slit would provide a @xmath131 test for detection of the zero magnetization versus the actual model magnetization ( @xmath132 g ) of the 3d model .",
    "similarly , @xmath133 would be sufficient for a test distinguishing between a non - magnetized and a strongly magnetized ( @xmath134 g ) transition region , with a similar level of confidence .",
    "[ fig : bdettara ] shows , both for the radial and tangential slit options , how the spatially - averaged ( including averaging along the whole length of the spectrograph s slit ) @xmath78 line - center signal of the emergent ly@xmath0 radiation from the 3d model varies with the average magnetization value of the model s tr . for each average magnetization , @xmath113 , a very large number of @xmath78 signals were obtained by a method analogous to the one described in the previous paragraph . in the radial - slit option case , the fact that the @xmath78 signal varies with the heliocentric angle ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : clvav ] ) has been taken into account .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath78 signal predicted for the tangential configuration is slightly larger than in the radial case , but the difference is not very important and both slit orientations appear to be suitable for detecting the ly@xmath0 scattering polarization .    our reasons in favor of the radial slit option for a sounding rocket experiment such as clasp are the following .",
    "first , in the case of the tangential slit orientation we would have data only for a small interval of @xmath104 values , for example with @xmath135 at the central slit point ( where the polarization amplitude is the largest ) .",
    "obviously , any significant pointing error would compromise the measurement .",
    "in contrast , the radial slit option provides much more information on the clv of the scattering polarization signals , and having such clv data would facilitate reaching more reliable conclusions via detailed confrontations with radiative transfer modeling . note that with a @xmath118 radially - oriented slit one can have information from the solar limb till about @xmath121 . with the radial slit option such clv information would be available both at the line center ( where the hanle effect in ly@xmath0 operates ) and in the nearby wings of the @xmath78 profile ( where effects of partial frequency redistribution and @xmath136-state interference come into play ; see @xcite ) . as shown by these authors , having in addition information on the clv of the @xmath78 wing signals may help to constrain ( together with the observed stokes @xmath14 profiles ) the thermal structure of the upper chromosphere . another reason to prefer the radial slit option",
    "is related with the fact that with the clasp ( which will measure the ly@xmath0 radiation @xmath137   from the line center ) it will be difficult to determine with sufficient precision the zero offset of the linear polarization scale , and having the above - mentioned clv information may help to end up with reliable conclusions in terms of the hanle effect .",
    "clasp will be observing the solar atmosphere for approximately five minutes during which the structure of the dynamical tr will change to some extent . in our numerical experiments , we have only considered an instantaneous state of the solar model atmosphere corresponding to a particular snapshot of the time - dependent simulation .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed an infinitely narrow spectrograph s slit and we have neglected any possible drift of the slit during the simulated observation . because of the fine structuring and dynamical behavior of the solar chromosphere , clasp can not aim at determining the magnetic field at high spatial resolution .",
    "however , the lack of spatio - temporal resolution might actually help us to end up with observables useful to determine the mean field strength of the solar tr .",
    "therefore , the standard deviations shown in figs .  [ fig : bdet ] and [ fig : bdettara ] should be understood as being the most pessimistic estimates and the real observation will be of better accuracy .",
    "the outer solar atmosphere is a highly structured and dynamic plasma , much more complex than a uniform , plane - parallel 1d configuration .",
    "very likely , the height of the tr varies from one place in the atmosphere to another , delineating a highly crumpled surface ( e.g. , such as in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jkq ] ) .",
    "strong spectral lines originate in this type of spatially complex plasmas , where the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities break the axial symmetry of the radiation field .",
    "this symmetry breaking produces changes in the scattering polarization signals , which may compete with those caused by the hanle effect .",
    "therefore , the interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations in chromospheric and tr lines requires solving a complex radiative transfer problem , namely the generation of spectral line polarization in realistic 3d models of the solar atmosphere .",
    "likewise , since the intensity profiles are practically insensitive to the magnetic field vector , the true way to validate or refute the models themselves is by confronting synthesized and measured stokes profiles , because the magnetic field information is encoded in the spectral line polarization .    in this paper",
    "we have extended to the full 3d case previous radiative transfer investigations of the scattering polarization in the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line , which were carried out using 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite models of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the 3d model of the extended solar atmosphere chosen for this investigation is representative of the physical conditions of an enhanced network region , with magnetic field lines that reach chromospheric and coronal heights ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mgf ] ) . using the radiative transfer code porta developed by @xcite we solved the full 3d radiative transfer problem of the generation and transfer of scattering polarization in the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line , and carried out numerical experiments to understand its magnetic sensitivity due to the hanle effect .",
    "the first noteworthy point is that contained in fig .",
    "[ fig : jkq ] , which shows the radiation field tensors that quantify the symmetry properties of the ly@xmath0 radiation .",
    "the fractional anisotropy of the ly@xmath0 radiation ( see the top right panel ) is fully negligible throughout the whole photosphere and chromosphere , but it suddenly becomes significant ( of the order of 10% ) and predominantly negative right at the tr . that the model s tr practically coincides with the corrugated surface where the optical depth is unity along the los . ] the other panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : jkq ] show that the radiation field tensors that quantify the breaking of the axial symmetry of the ly@xmath0 radiation are also negligible below the tr ; i.e. , in the regions where the optical depth at the line center is larger than unity . as the optical depth at the ly@xmath0 line center becomes smaller than unity at the tr , such radiation field tensors become significant . as a result",
    ", the emergent ly@xmath0 radiation shows conspicuous scattering polarization signals , with sizable @xmath78 and @xmath79 line - center amplitudes all over the solar disk , even in the unmagnetized reference case .    at full spatial resolution",
    "the most likely fractional polarization amplitude is 1.5% for simulated observations at @xmath85 ( close to the limb scattering geometry ) , while it is 0.7% at @xmath84 ( forward scattering geometry ) .",
    "the polarization signals drop below the 1% level when the spatial resolution is degraded .",
    "for example , for a square resolution element of 3 arc seconds the most likely forward scattering polarization signal decreases by a factor two . in the limit of no spatial resolution",
    "we find that the clv of the line - center @xmath78 signal is qualitatively similar to that found in semi - empirical 1d models of the solar atmosphere , with the largest polarization amplitudes around @xmath85 and with @xmath138 at @xmath84 .",
    "although the average magnetic field strength of the model s tr is only @xmath139 g , the hanle effect in the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line ( whose critical hanle field is 53 g ) produces a significant depolarization ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bsens ] ) . for stronger magnetic fields",
    "the ensuing depolarization is larger , until it reaches the hanle saturation limit for @xmath140 g . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdettara ] , for the radial slit case the @xmath141 line - center amplitudes are slightly smaller than in the tangential slit case , but they are equally measurable and show a similarly significant hanle depolarization . in section  [ ssec : tara ]",
    "we give our arguments in favor of the radial slit option when observing the ly@xmath0 scattering polarization with the clasp sounding rocket experiment .",
    "another important conclusion is that the hanle effect in forward scattering geometry ( i.e. , when observing the solar disk center ) does not necessarily create linear polarization in the presence of an inclined magnetic field , as it happens in the idealized case of 1d model atmospheres . the fact that in a 3d model of the solar atmosphere the radiation field that illuminates each point of the tr plasma does not have axial symmetry with respect to the local vertical direction implies that even in the absence of a magnetic field forward - scattering processes can produce significant linear polarization signals in ly@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , we have found and understood that in such a spatially - complex plasma the hanle effect of an inclined magnetic field tends instead to destroy the forward - scattering polarization , as it happens when observing close to the edge of the solar disk where one reaches the case of @xmath142 scattering geometry .",
