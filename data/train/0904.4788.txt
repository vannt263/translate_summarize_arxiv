    "the plasma wave generation mechanism [ 1 ] in an ultrashort - channel field effect transistor ( fet ) has attracted a considerable attention .",
    "the high - density 2deg can be used for detection [ 2],[3 ] of high - frequency radiation as well . the generation [ 4],[5 ] and both the non - resonant [ 6 ] and resonant [ 7]-[9 ] detection in the terahertz ( thz ) frequency range(see also [ 10 ] )",
    "have been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the current instability and the resulting plasma wave generation similar to that in fet can be obtained in ungated 2d electron layers [ 11 ] . moreover ,",
    "the possibility of a single - mode thz generator based on an ungated 2d electron layer was discussed in ref.[12 ] . in the present paper , we calculate the response of a detector based on ungated 2d electron layer for an arbitrary current on the assumption of a dissipationless carrier transport .",
    "the role of the finite carrier scattering strength is discussed .",
    "we demonstrate the feasibility of a single - mode detector operating in the terahertz frequency range .",
    "we use the hydrodynamic model of a weakly damped , incompressible charged - electron fluid placed in a rigid , neutralizing positive background .",
    "the mean free path associated with electron - electron collisions is assumed to be less than that related to scattering by phonons and impurities and than the device length .",
    "the behavior of the 2d fluid is described [ 11 ] by the euler and the continuity equations :    @xmath0    here , @xmath1 is the 2d electron density ; @xmath2 , electron flux velocity ; @xmath3 , effective mass ; @xmath4 , electronic charge ; and @xmath5 , potential , so that the electric field is @xmath6 .",
    "let us analyze the detector mode for the equivalent circuit shown in fig.1 .",
    "the boundary conditions at the source(@xmath7 ) and drain(@xmath8 ) are     ungated 2d electron gas detector setup configuration .",
    "the response @xmath9 is caused by the incident radiation @xmath10 . ]    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the current fixed at the drain , and @xmath13 is the 2d layer width .",
    "we further suppose that the incident electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength substantially longer than the device dimensions is collected by an antenna coupled with 2deg device .",
    "the boundary condition at the source can be realized by implementing the antenna output between the source contact and the ground .",
    "therefore , the background 2deg density at the source @xmath14 is kept constant .",
    "then , the slot antenna provides an ac voltage @xmath15 , and , hence the subsequent small variation of the 2des density at the source @xmath16 .",
    "finally , connecting the drain to the power supply via an inductance provides that the current at the drain is maintained constant .    in the absence of radiation",
    ", the steady state corresponds to a current - carrying electron fluid with a constant density @xmath17 ( because of the local quasi - neutrality of the 2d fluid ) and constant flux velocity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the carrier mobility .",

    "the @xmath56-th mode frequency exhibits a well pronounced red - shift upon an increase in the current .",
    "then , each mode is characterized by the respective increment , which is positive within a certain range of flux velocities @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the cutoff velocity of the @xmath56-th mode .",
    "actually , the current - driven cutoff of the instability is caused by vanishing of the upstream plasma wave group velocity @xmath64 when the relation @xmath65 is valid(see eq.(10 ) at @xmath48 ) .",

    "it is easy to check whether @xmath56-th mode is still present in the plasma wave spectrum by plotting the damping strength @xmath73 in the instability increment plot ( see fig.2 , inset ) . above a certain critical value of dissipation @xmath74",
    ", the instability disappears .",
    "then , for @xmath75 , only the proper mode remains unstable .",
    "note that , at small dissipation @xmath76 , an increase in the current must result in a step - by - step suppression of , first , higher- and , then , lower - index modes .",
    "now we can predict some essential features of the detector response . at @xmath77 ,",
    "the response is expected to be resonant at the proper- and higher - order mode frequencies given by eq.(12 ) . for intermediate values of scattering @xmath78 ,",
    "an increase in the current must lead to suppression of , first , higher- and , then , lower - index resonator modes . for certain values of @xmath79 , the detector response must exhibit a single - mode behavior . in the opposite case of a strong dissipation @xmath80 ,",
    "the response becomes non - resonant . in order to confirm our predictions ,",
    "we analyze in more detail the detector response in two limiting cases : a ) @xmath81 and b ) @xmath82 .",
    "we now find the detector response under the current - carrying condition @xmath83 and zero dissipation @xmath84 .",
    "substituting eq.(11 ) into eq.(7 ) , we obtain the detector response @xmath85 as follows    @xmath86    where we introduced dimensionless wave vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the response function . at small frequencies",
    "@xmath89 the detector response is described by the asymptote @xmath90 , and thus is independent of the current .",
    "then , at a zero drain current , eq.(14 ) describes the detector response @xmath91 which exhibits sharp resonances(see fig.3 ) at the fundamental frequency and its odd harmonics @xmath92 .",
    "as expected , in the opposite case of a nonzero current , the response function specified by eq.(14 ) demonstrates the noticeable red - shift of the resonator peaks(see fig.3 ) . at a fixed carrier flux velocity @xmath69 ,",
    "the detector response exhibits a cutoff at a certain frequency @xmath93 .",
    "when @xmath66 , only the first mode of the resonator can be excited , and , thus , the device operates as a single - mode detector(see heavy curve in fig.3 ) .",
    "we are now interested in the case of a detector operating under zero - current conditions @xmath94 and finite dissipation @xmath72 .",
    "the dispersion relationship is simplified as follows @xmath95 .",
    "the detector response given by eq.(7 ) yields @xmath96 without dissipation , i.e. at @xmath48 eq.(15 ) we reproduce the above - mentioned result @xmath91 which yields the zero - frequency asymptote as @xmath97 . an increase in the dissipation results in a smoothing of the resonant peaks ( see fig.4 ) which then shrink when the detector quality factor becomes on the order of unity , i.e. , @xmath98 . in the opposite case of a strong dissipation and(or ) long sample @xmath99 the oscillations excited at the source by the incident radiation",
    "do not reach the drain because of the damping .",
    "the boundary condition at the drain is irrelevant in this case and the response is independent of the sample length since @xmath100 . at substantially higher frequencies @xmath101",
    ", the response becomes independent of the scattering strength @xmath102 .",
    "let us estimate the values of the parameters determined in the present paper . for @xmath103 m channel and the typical 2deg density @xmath104sm@xmath105 , effective mass @xmath106 , and dielectric constant @xmath107 of ingaas lattice matched with inp , we obtain the proper mode frequency @xmath108thz . then , assuming the 2deg mobility @xmath109v / sm s , we find the relaxation time @xmath110s and the scattering parameter @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the proper mode is undamped since the quality factor @xmath112 .",
    "the device operates as a single - mode detector when the carrier flux velocity exceeds the value @xmath113 m/s .",
    "we now estimate the detector responsivity defined in ref.[14 ] .",
