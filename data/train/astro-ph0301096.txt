    "probing the star formation activity in galactic or subgalactic systems in early universe is important for understanding both the history of galaxies and the origin of cosmic reionization ( e.g. , loeb , barkana 2001 ) .",
    "recent advance in deep optical imaging capability with 8 - 10 m class telescopes enabled new searches for star - forming galaxies beyond redshift 5 .",
    "in particular , imaging surveys using narrow - passband filters have proved to be an efficient way to find such galaxies ( ajiki et al .",

    "indeed , the most distant ly@xmath7 emitter ( lae ) known to date , hcm 6a at @xmath10 was discovered by using this technique ( hu et al .",
    "however , surveys for emission - line galaxies with narrow - band filters have an intrinsic limitation in redshift coverage and hence the survey volumes are not often large enough to ensure robust for success . in order to increase survey volumes and to reach faint limiting magnitude",
    ", we need wide - field ccd cameras on 8 - 10 m class telescopes .",
    "suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al . 2002 ) mounted at the prime focus of the 8.2 m subaru telescope ( kaifu 1998 ) on mauna kea , hawaii , provides a unique opportunity for wide - field ( a @xmath15 field of view ) , narrowband imaging surveys for emission - line objects at high redshift .",
    "the most distant lae , hcm 6a at @xmath16 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ) , is gravitationally amplified by a factor of 4.5 by the foreground cluster of galaxies abell 370 at @xmath17 .",
    "although the help of any gravitational lensing is highly useful in investigating faint high-@xmath18 objects ( ellis et al .",
    "2001 ; hu et al .",
    "2002 ) , it is also important to search for high-@xmath18 laes in a so - called blank field for an unbiased study . in an attempt to find star - forming objects at @xmath19 in such a blank field ,",
    "we have carried out a very deep optical imaging survey in the subaru deep field ( sdf ) centered at @xmath7(j2000 ) = @xmath20 and @xmath21(j2000 ) = @xmath22 ( e.g. , maihara et al .",

    ", we report on our discovery of two ly@xmath7 emitters at @xmath23 6.5  6.6 .",
    "in this survey , we used the narrow - passband filter , nb921 , centered on @xmath24 = 9196    with a passband of @xmath25(fwhm ) = 132  , corresponding to a redshift range between 6.508 and 6.617 for the ly@xmath7 emission .",
    "optical imaging was made in the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath0 bands on a central @xmath28 area of the sdf with suprime - cam .",
    "our direct imaging was obtained during several observing runs between 2001 april and 2002 may .",
    "the total integrations time was 4.7 hr , 5.8 hr , and 5.0 hr for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 , respectively .",

    "the limiting magnitude ( ab ) for a 5@xmath30 detection on a @xmath31 diameter aperture is 26.9 , 26.1 , and 25.7 for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 , respectively .    for each object detected in the @xmath0 image , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0",
    "magnitudes are measured on a common aperture of @xmath31 diameter . in total ,",
    "50,449 objects are detected down to @xmath32 ( the @xmath33 limiting magnitude ) .",
    "the effective area used to search for @xmath0-excess objects is 814.3 arcmin@xmath4 . the fwhm half ",
    "power points of the filter correspond to a co - moving depth along the line of sight of 40.9 @xmath34 mpc .",
    "thus a total volume of 202,000 @xmath35 mpc@xmath36 is probed in our @xmath0 image .",
    "we select candidates of @xmath37 laes imposing two criteria , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , on the above objects .",
    "there are 404 objects satisfying the first criterion alone .",
    "the latter criterion is used to reduce contamination from foreground objects .",
    "objects at @xmath19 have sharp breaks because of the strong ly@xmath7 absorption at this redshift ( songaila , cowie 2002 ) and are expected to exceed the adopted i - z criterion while low redshift galaxies invariably do not .",
    "this latter criterion is applied only to objects brighter than @xmath40 ( @xmath41 limiting magnitude ) , and we retain all the objects ( satisfying @xmath38 ) with @xmath42 in order not to miss possible faint laes .",
    "these selection procedures yield eventually a photometric sample of 73 lae candidates .",
    "note that among the objects with @xmath43 , those brighter than @xmath44 ( @xmath45 limiting magnitude ) satisfy automatically @xmath46 , but we can not obtain a meaningful constraint on @xmath47 for those with @xmath48 .      in order to investigate the nature of lae candidates found in our optical imaging survey , we obtained optical spectroscopy of nine objects in our lae candidate sample using the subaru faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas : kashikawa et al .",
    "2002 ) on 2002 june 7 - 9 under a 0.@xmath4955 - 1.@xmath4910 seeing condition .",
    "this spectroscopic sample contains the brightest three objects with @xmath50 .",
    "however , the remaining six objects are randomly selected from the photometric sample and they have @xmath51  25.5 .",
    "our optical spectroscopy was made with the 300 lines mm@xmath12 grating and an o58 order cut filter .",
    "the wavelength coverage was between 6000    to 10000    with a pixel resolution of 1.34  .",
    "the use of an 0.8 arcsec - wide slit gave a spectroscopic resolution of 9.0    at 9200    ( or @xmath52 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution was 0.@xmath493 pixel@xmath12 by 3-pixel , on - chip binning .",
    "spectroscopy of the brightest object in our lae sample ( @xmath0 = 23.01 ) was obtained in the long - slit spectroscopy mode .",
    "the exposure time was 1800 seconds .",
    "this source was quickly identified as an [ o iii]@xmath535007 emitter at @xmath54 .",
    "other eight objects were observed in the multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) mode .",
    "we chose two fields that contained as many lae candidates as possible ; hereafter field 1 and field 2 .",
    "we succeeded in obtaining spectra of three targets in field 1 and five in field 2 .",
    "the same grating , filter , and slit as those in the long - slit mode were used in this mos mode .",
    "we obtained twelve and six 1800s exposures for field 1 and field 2 , respectively .",
    "we also obtained the spectrum of a standard star hz 44 for flux calibration .",
    "our optical spectroscopy ( see figure 1 ) indicates that at least two objects are well - defined laes between @xmath55 and @xmath56 because their emission - line shapes show the sharp cutoff on the uv side together with the continuum depression at wavelengths shortward of the line peak .",
    "two more objects also show the sharp cutoff at wavelengths shortward of the line peak . however , their continuum magnitudes are so faint that we can not see firm evidence for the continuum break",
    ". although they are probable candidates of laes at @xmath57  6.6 , we do not include them in the later discussion9200    in our optical spectra .",
    "since they show an almost symmetrical emission - line profile , we can not identify them as laes solely basing upon our optical spectroscopy ; they may be either an [ o ii]@xmath533727 source at @xmath58 or a lae at @xmath19 ( e.g. , stern et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it seems also worthwhile noting that a symmetric emission - line profile does not necessarily rule out the case of ly@xmath7 emission ( e.g. , eso 350-ig038 in kunth et al .",
    "the remaining two sources are confirmed to be [ o iii]@xmath535007 emitters at @xmath54 . ] . in the spectra of the well - defined two laes , sdf j132415.7 + 273058 in field 2 and",
    "sdf j132418.3 + 271455 in field 1 [ panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively ] , continuum emission appears to be present at wavelengths longer than the ly@xmath7 peak . combining these two spectra and applying a 3-pixel smoothing",
    ", we obtain the average spectrum in panel ( c ) . the average continuum flux density between 1200    and 1210    is @xmath59 ergs s@xmath12 @xmath60 @xmath12 while that between 1219    and 1226    is @xmath61 ergs s@xmath12 @xmath60 @xmath12 .",
    "this difference is regarded as evidence for the continuum break in the spectra of these two laes .",
    "the redshifts of the two laes are estimated from the peak of the ly@xmath7 emission line and the results are given in table 1 together with line widths .",
    "it is noted that sdf j132418.3 + 271455 ( @xmath62 ) is more distant than hcm 6a at @xmath10 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ) because error of our redshift measurement is @xmath63 0.002 .",
    "therefore , sdf j132418.3 + 271455 is the most distant lae known to date .",
    "thumbnail images of the two objects are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath0 images reveal that only sdf j132415.7 + 273058 is spatially extended ; its angular diameter ( fwhm ) is estimated as 1.2 arcsec . correcting for the seeing spread ( 0.9 arcsec ) ,",
    "we obtain an angular diameter of 0.8 arcsec , corresponding to 4.4 @xmath34 kpc at @xmath64 .",
    "the sdf is a so - called blank field and there is no apparent cluster of galaxies known to date at low and intermediate redshifts in our field . since , further",
    ", the lensing effect is expected to be small in this field , our survey results allow us to perform a simple statistical analysis of star formation activity in the investigated volume even though our sample is not large .",
    "first , we estimate the star formation rate of the laes at @xmath19 by using the relation @xmath65 ( kennicutt 1998 ; brocklehurst 1971 ) . the observed ly@xmath7 flux , the ly@xmath7 luminosity , and the star formation rate , sfr(ly@xmath7 ) , of each lae are summarized in table 1 where a flat universe with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 with @xmath69100 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 ) is adopted .",
    "the average sfr obtained for the two laes is 7.1 @xmath63 2.0 @xmath70 yr@xmath12 , being comparable to those of laes at @xmath71 5.1  5.8 ( e.g. , ajiki et al . 2002 ) . it should be mentioned that the sfrs estimated above are lower limits because it is quite likely that a blue half or more of the ly@xmath7 emission may be absorbed by h i gas and dust grains in the galaxy itself and by the intergalactic h i gas ( miralda - escud 1998 ; miralda - escud , rees 1998 ; cen , mcdonald 2002 ) .",
    "the sfr based on the ly@xmath7 luminosity tends to be underestimated by a few times or more than that based on the uv luminosity ( see also hu et al .",
    "2002 ) . indeed , using the average uv continuum flux density between 1219    and 1226    for the combined spectrum shown in panel ( c ) of figure 1 together with the relation ( kennicutt 1998 ) , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is in units of ergs s@xmath12 hz@xmath12",
    ", we obtain an average value of @xmath74 yr@xmath12 for the two laes . as for sdf j132415.7 + 273058 , we obtained @xmath75-band imaging using the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs : kobayashi et al .",
    "2000 ) on the subaru telescope on 2002 july 15 .",
    "the integration time was 6480 seconds ( the detail will be given elsewhere ) .",
    "the @xmath75 magnitude ( ab ) is estimated as @xmath76 24.9 .",
    "this photometry allows us to estimate the star formation rate at @xmath77 = 1650    for sdf j132415.7 + 273058 ; @xmath78(uv ) @xmath79 yr@xmath12 , which is even higher by a factor of four than @xmath78(ly@xmath7 ) .",
    "this is suggestive of dust obscuration at the bluest wavelengths .",
    "now we can estimate the total star formation rate of 73 laes in our photometric sample using the equivalent width of nb921 flux .",
    "we have identified one lae ( sdf j132415.7 + 273058 ) in the three brightest candidates and the other ( sdf j132418.3 + 271455 ) in the faint sample .",
    "because of small number statistics , it seems modest to assume that approximately 22% ( = 2/9 ) of 73 lae candidates are real laes at @xmath23 6.5 - 6.6 in any magnitude range ; note that 95 % confidence level based on the random sampling hypothesis ranges 8 % - 49 % .",
    "if we assume that all the 73 lae candidates are true laes at @xmath57  6.6 , we obtain nominally a total star formation rate of @xmath80 yr@xmath12 . provided that approximately 22% of 73 lae candidates are real laes at @xmath23 6.5 - 6.6",
    ", we can estimate the total star formation rate , @xmath81 yr@xmath12 .",
    "given the survey volume , 202,000 @xmath35 mpc@xmath36 , we thus obtain a star formation rate density of @xmath82 yr@xmath12 mpc@xmath13 . it should be reminded here again that we apply neither any reddening correction nor integration by assuming a certain luminosity function for laes .",
    "further , we note that there are two more probable lae candidates in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "therefore , our estimate should be regarded as a robust and first meaningful lower limit for the star formation rate density beyond @xmath83 .",
    "let us compare this value with previous estimates in figure 3 ; note that we convert all the previous estimates to those in the cosmology adopted in this letter . in conclusion ,",
    "the present study shows unambiguously that the moderate star formation activity already occurred in the early universe beyond @xmath83 .",
    "we would like to thank the subaru telescope staff for their invaluable assistance .",
    "we would also like to thank prof .",
    "hy spinrad both for useful comments for the earlier version of this paper and for encouragement .",
