    "in the last decade , the number of events organized by the universities for students at high school or even elementary school has increased significantly .",
    "this can be seen , e.g. , by browsing corresponding university websites .",
    "publications , however , are mostly informal and often concentrate on compiling the material used rather than on explaining and reflecting the methodological and didactic concepts involved .",
    "one of the few exceptions is a paper by halverscheid and sibbertsen @xcite in which the authors conduct a careful analysis of the students feedback .",
    "the aim of many events is to recruit future university students in the respective discipline . in view of the high number of university drop - outs  in particular in mathematics ",
    "it is worthwhile to design recruiting events in such a way which allows the participants to gain a realistic insight into their potential life as a student rather than merely to maximize the number of future students . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we suggest using a format which allows applicants to imitate the main activities that university students have to pursue during their mathematics studies , in particular those of the first year at university : attending lectures , solving exercises on their own or in small groups and presenting solutions to classmates .",
    "in addition , we suggest that the level of the lectures and exercises should ever so often reach university level . in order to meet the latter goal ,",
    "one first has to select an appropriate topic . on the one hand",
    ", the topic needs to be accessible for high school students and on the other hand it should allow the teacher to illustrate what university studies are about .",
    "second , a workshop which covers the above three activities ( attending lectures , solving exercises , presenting solutions ) has to be conceptualized .    in this article",
    "we report on a workshop for grade eleven high school students organized in the summer term 2013 at the university of wuppertal ( germany ) and whose topic was the mathematical notion of a metric space .",
    "in section [ sec-2 ] we outline the material covered and we describe our work flow during the workshop . in section [ sec-3 ]",
    "we present and discuss the feedback received from the participants .",
    "our workshop entitled metric spaces  on the notion of distance in mathematics took place in the summer term 2013 at the university of wuppertal ( germany ) .",
    "it was part of the wuppertal summer university , an open day for female high school students interested in mathematics , natural sciences or engineering .",
    "one specific aim was to complement other formats like lectures , presentations or panel discussions by an event that allows the participants to take an active role and enables them to experience what it feels like to study mathematics on a university level .",
    "the workshop took place in a seminar room and lasted for two hours .",
    "eleven high school students , between 16 and 18 years old , participated . due to the format of the open day",
    ", the participants came from different high schools with wildly varying backgrounds in mathematics .",
    "german high school education usually treats concepts like mappings , limits or continuity not in a rigorous but rather in an intuitive way . in order to allow the students to work on the exercises together ,",
    "they were split into four groups . since we had recruited four undergraduate students for the workshop we were able to assign one teaching assistant to each group to provide support during the exercise sessions .    in order to make our workshop on the basis of this article easily reproducible we give in the sequel an outline of the lecture , the exercises and their solutions .",
    "we note that the following is a selection of standard material as presented in courses on analysis and is covered together with more background information in many textbooks .",
    "we refer , e.g. , to rudin ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 , p.30ff ) , browder ( * ? ? ? * chapter 6.2 ) , amann and escher ( * ? ? ? * chapter ii.1 ) and dugundji ( * ? ? ? * chapter ix ) . for further reading about the manhattan metric ,",
    "see exercise [ exercise-1 ] and theorem [ thm ] , we refer to the book by krause @xcite .",
    "we started the workshop with the following exercise for the students .",
    "[ exercise-1 ] find a meaningful notion of distance in the following four situations .",

    "we used application [ app ] in order to point out that the notion of a metric space now allows for a formal definition .",
    "this is a clear advantage compared with an only intuitive idea .",

    "in section 1 , the goal of our workshop was described as painting a realistic picture of mathematical studies at university .",
    "our workshop met this goal in two ways : the first way is concerned with a theoretically based analysis of the content of the workshop .",
    "it inherited lecture parts which not only touched university level but also provided a realistic insight into basic skills and methods used in mathematics : definition [ dfn ] , theorem [ thm ] and the notion of convergence given in application [ app ] appear verbatim in many first year courses on analysis .",
    "the participants solved exercises , in particular exercise [ exercise-3 ] is compatible with homework for first year university students in the german system .",
    "finally , the participants presented the solutions to their classmates as it is usually required by university students during exercise sessions . due to the concept of working in small groups with one",
    "teaching assistant assigned to each group it was possible to provide the participants not only with an experience what mathematical studies are , but also with an experience what mathematics is about .",
    "the second way in which the workshop met our goal stated in section 1 is related to students written feedback .",
    "after the workshop , they were asked to answer the following prompts :    what did you like ?",
    "what did you understand well ?    what did",
    "nt you like ?",
    "what did nt you understand well ?",
    "what additional comments do you have ?",
    "two students mentioned that they liked that the workshop was close to university studies :        probably very similar to university studies        good insight into university studies    five students explicitly mentioned that they liked the active participation via exercises , e.g. :        by computing ourselves we could understand everything much better        concrete exercises and not only theory    eight students appreciated working in small groups and explicitly mentioned it , e.g. :        working independently in groups    with regards to criticism , two participants indicated that the topic was difficult , eight mentioned that the lecture parts were too fast and that there was not enough time for the exercises though one student , at the same time , admitted in a rather rational way that this is probably due to university studies .",
    "however , the latter impressions are a characteristic aspect of studies in mathematics and it is therefore a good idea honestly to inform prospective students about this issue before they finally decide which major to take .",
    "as we explained in section [ sec-3 ] the workshop was very successful .",
    "it met our goals and it received an encouraging feedback from the participants . in particular , assigning exercises to the participants seemed to be a key factor for the success of the workshop .",
    "this corresponds , e.g. , to the results of halverscheid and sibbertsen @xcite who found in a similar format that exercises are most important for the students .",
    "we can thus recommend the workshop format as well as our concrete topic to anybody interested in organizing a similar open day in mathematics .",
    "the authors would like to thank m.frantzen , f.hasenkamp , k.kerkmann , e.molar and n.vaz for their help during the workshop .",
