    "this means that all individuals in the population have equal chances in the competition for resources such as food , light , space etc .",
    ", see e.g.  @xcite . in many species , however , competition for resources that determine individual mortality and fertility is based on some hierarchy in the population which is related to individuals size or to any other variable that characterizes physiological structure . significant amount of interest has been paid to understand the dynamics of populations that exhibit _ contest _ competition .",
    "structured population models are a useful tool to study intra - specific contest competition . both ( time-)discrete ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and continuous ( see e.g.  @xcite ) models have been formulated and analysed to this end .",
    "most of the nonlinear models in the literature incorporate environmental feedback through some form of density dependence in the vital rates .",
    "our goal in this paper is to carry out a qualitative analysis of a continuous model which incorporates quite general nonlinearities .",
    "we study the following quasilinear partial integro - differential equation @xmath0 with the initial condition @xmath1 this model describes the long term dynamics of a population of a sufficiently large size living in a closed habitat .",
    "the function @xmath2 denotes the density of individuals of size ( or other developmental stage ) @xmath3 at time @xmath4 .",
    "it is assumed that individuals may have different sizes at birth and therefore @xmath5 denotes the rate at which individuals of size @xmath6 `` produce '' individuals of size @xmath3 .",
    "hence the non - local integral term in equation represents the recruitment of individuals into the population .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the size - specific growth rate , while @xmath8 stands for the mortality rate .",
    "we assume that individual growth is also regulated by a weighted population size @xmath9 , for example due to competition .",
    "mortality however , depends on the size - specific environment @xmath10 , for example due to cannibalism .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is related to the strength of the hierarchy in the population .",
    "we note that if @xmath12 our model reduces to the scramble competition model that in the special case @xmath13 was considered in @xcite .",

    "they established global existence and uniqueness of solutions using results from the theory of nonlinear evolution equations .",
    "model - is a special case of the general model treated in @xcite , however , in @xcite qualitative questions were not addressed .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , our paper focuses on the existence and local asymptotic stability of equilibrium solutions of system - with particular regards to the effects of the distributed states at birth ( previously we addressed simpler models without hierarchical structure in @xcite ) .",
    "earlier , in @xcite henson and cushing studied continuous age - structured hierarchical models .",
    "they compared models with scramble versus contest competition for a limited resource .",
    "in particular the equilibrium levels for the two modes of competition were analyzed .",
    "crucially however , the models in @xcite incorporate vital rates that do not depend explicitly on the structuring variable .    in section [ section :",
    "existence ] , we will establish conditions for the existence of positive steady states of our model .",
    "the question of the existence of non - trivial steady states is difficult mainly for two reasons .",
    "firstly , due to hierarchy in the population related to individual size , individual mortality and fertility depend on the size specific environment @xmath10 .",
    "this environmental feedback yields an infinite dimensional nonlinearity in the model equations , in contrast to gurtin - maccamy type models @xcite , where the vital rates depend on a weighted total population size , or on a finite number of such variables . secondly , as individuals may be recruited into the population at all possible sizes , a recruitment operator of infinite rank arises .",
    "this means that the steady state equation can not be solved explicitly . in @xcite",
    "we overcame this issue for a simpler model where the model ingredients only depended on the total population size by using results from the spectral theory of positive operators . unfortunately this approach can not be extended to the model considered here .",
    "therefore we devise a different approach , based on fixed point results for nonlinear maps in conical shells of a banach space , see @xcite .",
    "this approach was used before to treat age - structured models ( also with diffusion ) , see @xcite , where every individual enters the population at a single state , namely at age zero .",
    "the method is based on the construction of an appropriate nonlinear map that requires the implicit solution of the steady state equation .",
    "however , the solution of the steady state equation of our model is not available .",
    "therefore we need to construct an appropriate sequence of recruitment processes of finite rank for which we can solve the corresponding steady state problems .",
    "then we show that the steady states constructed from the fixed points of the sequence of the nonlinear maps , have actually a convergent subsequence and we show that the limit point is actually a steady state of the original problem - .    in section [ section :",
    "asymptotic ] we focus on the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the model .",
    "a positive quasicontraction semigroup describes the evolution of solutions of the system linearized at an equilibrium solution .",
    "we establish a regularity property of the governing linear semigroup in proposition [ reg ] that allows in principle to address stability questions of positive equilibrium solutions of - .",
    "however , even the point spectrum of the linearized semigroup generator can not be characterized explicitly via zeros of an associated characteristic function .",
    "this is because the eigenvalue equation can not be solved explicitly due to the infinite dimensional nonlinearity in the original model and the very general recruitment process .",
    "we will overcome this issue by using compact positive perturbations of the semigroup generator and rank one perturbations of the general recruitment term .",

    "it is however not a sufficient condition in contrast to scramble competition models , i.e.  when density dependence is incorporated via finite dimensional nonlinearities in the vital rates .",
    "[ trivialss ] assume that there exists a function @xmath136 such that @xmath263 and @xmath264 ( where @xmath265 stands for the net reproduction functional corresponding to the fertility function @xmath136 ) .",

    "nevertheless , the question of the existence of positive equilibrium solutions for hierarchical models remained an open question up to our knowledge . in this work we formulated biologically relevant conditions for the existence of positive steady states of a very general model .    in the second part we focused on the stability of equilibria . as we have also seen earlier in @xcite ,",
    "the main difficulty to establish easily verifiable stability / instability conditions for positive steady states of hierarchical structured population models is that the point spectrum of the semigroup generator can not be characterized explicitly via zeros of an associated characteristic function . in @xcite",
    "we devised a dissipativity calculation to show that the linearized semigroup has negative growth bound , and therefore the steady state is stable .",
    "the stability conditions we obtained in that way , though , were extremely restrictive .",
    "therefore in this work we devised a new approach to establish stability by using results from the theory of compact and positive operators .",
    "the separability assumption made in is only required for the result of grabosch and heijmans @xcite to be applicable , and not to prove any of the results concerning the linearized semigroup @xmath276 .",
    "a principle of linearized stability for fully nonlinear quasilinear hyperbolic equations remains a problem for future investigations ( see also @xcite for related results ) .",
