    "there are several automated tools for inferring the properties of the stellar populations contributing to the integrated galaxy spectra .",
    "the list includes moped @xcite , starlight @xcite , steckmap @xcite , vespa @xcite , or ulyss , as well as the use of line indices like the lick indices @xcite .",
    "similarly , there are semi - automatic procedures to deduce the properties of the gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including the so - called strong - line ratio methods .",
    "these tools are ( and will be ) fundamental for understanding the galaxy formation and evolution , but the blind use of the codes results quite unsatisfactory from a physical stand point .",
    "one obtains a precise quantitative description of the stellar populations contributing to the integrated spectra , but ignores the reason why the code has chosen them rather than other potential alternatives .",
    "the educated eye of an astronomer is often far more telling from a physical point of view .",
    "unfortunately , the know - how of qualitatively interpreting a spectrum is learned after a long experience of working in the field .",
    "the information on which particular spectral feature informs of which particular physical property is scattered among a large number of technical publications , difficult to identify and to deal with for a newcomer .",
    "this paper aims at providing a step - by - step guide to qualitative interpretation of galaxy spectra .",
    "moreover , it will be compared with up - to - date numerical techniques to show that both qualitative and quantitative results are in excellent agreement .",
    "the work was originally planned as a mere academic exercise to understand the nature of the classes resulting from the k - means classification of all the galaxy spectra in the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss - dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "we wanted to translate the spectral shapes into physical units like stellar ages and metallicities , so that this information can be used to tailor class - based searches , or when interpreting spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the exercise is of interest beyond the original scope .",
    "the simple decision tree we use is suitable to characterize any galaxy spectrum .",
    "we know of its generality because it allows to separate and characterize the 28 automated spectroscopic k - means - based ( ask ) classes @xcite which , by construction , are proxies that condense the properties of the some one - million sdss spectra @xcite .",
    "the ask class characterization represents a significant part of the paper , that are discussed in detail as an illustration of the procedure .",
    "as we stress above , our qualitative analysis may have several other applications , e.g. , ( 1 ) to gain physical insight when interpreting quantitative star formation histories ( sfhs ) derived from modern automated tools , ( 2 ) for quick - look galaxy classification ( not only in the local universe , but also at moderate - high redshifts , since the hubble expansion shifts the uv - visible spectrum to the near ir ) , ( 3 ) for interpreting noisy spectra where eyeball inspection is often better than detailed inversion , ( 4 ) as reference for identifying unusual galaxies , or ( 5 ) for educational purposes to develop physical intuition .",

    "@xcite classified all the galaxies with spectra in sdss - dr7 into only 28 ask classes .",
    "the original sdss covers one - fourth of the sky and contains the spectra of all the galaxies above an apparent magnitude threshold ( sdss  @xmath0 ) .",
    "therefore , the some one million sdss spectra can be regarded as representative of the galaxies of the local universe , and so do the ask classes inferred from them . the ask classification is detailed in @xcite , with additional properties of the classes discussed elsewhere . for the sake of comprehensiveness ,",
    "however , we summarize here the main properties .",
    "all galaxies with redshift smaller than 0.25 were transformed to a common rest - frame wavelength scale , and then re - normalized to the integrated flux in the sdss @xmath1-filter .",
    "these two are the only manipulations the spectra underwent before classification .",
    "we wanted the classification to be driven only by the shape of the visible spectrum ( from 400 to 770 nm ) , and these two corrections remove obvious undesired dependencies of the observed spectra on redshift and galaxy apparent magnitude .",
    "we deliberately avoided correcting for other effects requiring modeling and assumptions ( e.g. , dust extinction , seeing , or aperture effects ) .",
    "the employed classification algorithm , k - means , is a robust workhorse that allows the simultaneous classification of the full data set ( @xmath212 gb ) .",
    "it is commonly employed in data mining , machine learning , and artificial intelligence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it guarantees that similar rest - frame spectra belong to the same class .",
    "most galaxies ( 99% ) were assigned to only 17 major classes , with 11 additional minor classes including the remaining 1% .",
    "it is unclear whether the ask classes represent genuine clusters in the 1637-dimensional classification space , or if they slice a continuous distribution ",
    "probably the two kinds of classes are present ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all the galaxies in a class have very similar spectra , which are also similar to the class template spectrum formed as the average of all the spectra of the galaxies in the class .",
    "these template spectra are the ones analyzed in the paper .",
    "the averaging is slightly different from the one in @xcite , and the novelty allows us to reach the near uv of the spectrum .",
    "the sdss spectrograph detects from 3800  to 9200(e.g .",
    "* ) , however , the templates cover from 3000  to 9200 .",
    "the uv extension is recovered because the classified galaxies have redshifts up to 0.25 , which moves the rest - frame @xmath33000  within the observed range . rather than averaging the spectral range common to all galaxies , the new templates consider the full range of available rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "given a wavelength bin , it includes the spectra of all the galaxies in the class that have been observed at that particular rest - frame wavelength .",
    "consequently , the template spectra ( i.e. , the average spectra ) include wavelengths down to 3000 .",
    "the templates thus obtained vary smoothly and continuously .",
    "they are labeled according to the @xmath4 color , from the reddest , ask  0 , to the bluest , ask  27 .",
    "the use of numbers to label the classes does not implicitly assumes the spectra to follow a one dimensional family .",
    "the numbers only name the classes .",
    "the sorting ( and , so , the naming ) would have been slightly different using other bandpasses to define colors . in general , however , the smaller the ask class number the redder the spectrum .",
    "the ask classification of all galaxies with spectra in sdss - dr7 is publicly available , templates includedftp://ask:galaxy@ftp.iac.es/ + http://sdc.cab.inta-csic.es/ask/index.jsp in the spanish virtual observatory . ] .",
    "wavelengths of sdss spectra ( and of ask templates ) are vacuum wavelengths .",
    "however , all the spectra shown in this paper are transformed to air wavelengths according to the equations by @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectra used for classification , and so the templates shown along the paper , are given as flux per unit wavelength .",
    "galaxies have composite spectra . they integrate contributions from different stars of different stellar populations , from hii regions , from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , as well as from other possible components .",
    "our qualitative analysis builds on this fact , and tries to separate each spectrum into a minimum number of components .",
    "we consider the ( ionized ) gas and the stars separately , that is to say , the emission and absorption lines separately .",
    "each one of these two components is assumed to have one or two sub - components .",
    "the details on the characterization are summarized as a decision tree in sect .",
    "[ decision_tree ] .",
    "it is based on the analysis of a set of general spectral features , listed in the next sub - section .",
    "the main spectral features that can be considered are listed in the section , ordered from the more obvious to the subtle details .",
    "each item names the particular feature , and then outlines its main properties and interest .",
    "the actual features are illustrated using the appropriate ask templates .    1 .   the shape of the continuum and the presence or not of emission and absorption lines must be considered .",
    "the emission lines trace the ionized gas and its excitation mechanism .",
    "the absorption lines trace the stellar populations , their ages and metallicities .",
    "the overall continuum shape is modulated by the gas , the stars , as well as by the presence of dust .",
    "figure  [ dust_effect ] shows the prototype red galaxy with passively evolving stellar populations ( ask  0 ) .",
    "although red , the continuum is rather flat from 6000   on .",
    "spectra even redder must be shaped by dust extinction ( see ask  1 in fig .  [ dust_effect ] ) .",
    "the so - called 4000  _ break _ is produced by the absorption of metallic lines of a variety of elements in various states of ionization , including caii  h  and  k ( @xmath53969  and 3934 ) and high - order lines of the balmer series ( h@xmath63970 , h@xmath73889 , h@xmath83835 ,  ) ( see * ? ? ?",
