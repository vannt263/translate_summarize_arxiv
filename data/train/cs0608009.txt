    "shape comparison is probably one of the most challenging issues in computer vision and pattern recognition . in recent years",
    "many papers have been devoted to this subject and new mathematical techniques have been developed to deal with this problem . in the early 90 s ,",
    "size theory was proposed as a geometrical / topological approach to shape comparison .",
    "the main idea is to translate the comparison of two datasets ( e.g. 3d - models , images or sounds ) into the comparison of two suitable topological spaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 , endowed with two continuous functions @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "these functions are called _",
    "@xmath5-dimensional measuring functions _ and are chosen according to the application . in other words , they can be seen as descriptors of the properties considered relevant for the comparison . in @xcite the definition of the natural pseudo - distance @xmath6 between the pairs @xmath7 , @xmath8 was introduced , setting @xmath9 equal to the infimum of the change of the measuring function , induced by composition with all the homeomorfisms from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . unfortunately , the study of @xmath6 is quite difficult , even for @xmath10 , although strong properties can be proved in this case ( cf .",
    "size theory tackles this problem by introducing some mathematical tools that allow us to easily obtain lower bounds for @xmath6 , such as _ size homotopy groups _ and _ size functions _",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is to study the pairs @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is defined by setting @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath5-th size homotopy group @xmath15 describes the non - trivial equivalence classes of @xmath5-dimensional loops in @xmath16 that remain homotopically non - trivial also in @xmath17 .",
    "size functions count the number of connected components in @xmath17 that meet @xmath18 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath19 is a set whose cardinality is equal to the value taken by the size function at @xmath20 . from the homological point of view , an analogous approach , named _ size functor _ , has been developed in @xcite for @xmath0-dimensional measuring functions .",
    "more recently , similar ideas have independently led edelsbrunner et al . to the definition of _ persistent homology _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and allili et al . to the definition of the _ morse homology descriptor _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    from the beginning of the 90 s ,",
    "size functions have been studied and applied in the case of @xmath0-dimensional measuring functions ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the multidimensional case presented more severe difficulties , since a concise , complete and stable description of multidimensional size functions was not available before this work .    in @xcite ,",
    "carlsson and zomorodian examine the completeness problem by studying multidimensional persistent homology . in that paper",
    ", it is claimed that multidimensional persistence has an essentially different character from its @xmath0-dimensional version .",
    "indeed , their approach does not seem to lead to a concise , complete and stable descriptor in the multidimensional case , whereas it does in classical persistent homology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first result of this paper is the proof that in size theory the comparison of multidimensional size functions can be reduced to the @xmath0-dimensional case by a suitable change of variables ( theorem [ reduction ] ) .",
    "the key idea is to show that a foliation in half - planes can be given , such that the restriction of a multidimensional size function to these half - planes turns out to be a classical size function in two scalar variables .",
    "our approach implies that each size function , with respect to a @xmath5-dimensional measuring function , can be completely and compactly described by a parameterized family of discrete descriptors ( remark [ descriptor ] ) .",
    "this follows from the results proved in @xcite about the representation of classical size functions by means of formal series of points and lines , applied to each plane in our foliation .",
    "an important consequence is that we can easily prove the stability of this new descriptor ( and hence of the corresponding @xmath5-dimensional size function ) also in higher dimensions ( proposition [ stability ] ) , by using a recent result of stability proved for @xmath0-dimensional size functions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and analogous to the result obtained in @xcite for persistence homology . as a final contribution",
    ", we show that a matching distance between size functions , with respect to measuring functions taking values in @xmath21 , can easily be introduced ( definition [ multidimatch ] ) .",
    "this matching distance provides a lower bound for the natural pseudo - distance , also in the multidimensional case ( theorem [ lowbound ] ) .",

    "the family @xmath87 is a new complete descriptor for @xmath88 , in the sense that two multidimensional size functions coincide if and only if the corresponding parameterized families of formal series coincide .",
    "in @xcite , it has been shown that @xmath0-dimensional size functions can be compared by means of a distance , called _ matching distance_. this distance is based on the observation that each @xmath0-dimensional size function is the sum of characteristic functions of triangles .",
    "the matching distance is computed by finding an optimal matching between the sets of triangles describing two size functions . for a formal definition",
    "we refer to @xcite ( see also @xcite for the analogue of the matching distance in persistent homology ) . in the sequel , we shall denote by @xmath89 the matching distance between the @xmath0-dimensional size functions @xmath86 and @xmath90 .",
    "the following result is an immediate consequence of theorem [ reduction ] and remark [ descriptor ] .",
    "let us consider the size pairs @xmath22 , @xmath91 .",

    "if @xmath119 is finite , this pseudo - distance appears to be particularly suitable for applications , from a computational point of view .",
    "in @xmath120 consider the set @xmath121\\times[-1,1]\\times[-1,1]$ ] and the sphere @xmath122 of equation @xmath123 . let also @xmath124 be the continuous function , defined as @xmath125 . in this setting , consider the size pairs @xmath22 and @xmath8 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath24 and @xmath128 are respectively the restrictions of @xmath129 to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "therefore , theorem [ reduction ] implies that , for every @xmath144 @xmath145 in this case , by theorem [ lowbound ] and remark [ a ] ( applied for @xmath119 containing just the admissible pair that we have chosen ) , a lower bound for the natural pseudo - distance @xmath146 is given by @xmath147 indeed , the matching distance @xmath89 is equal to the cost of moving the point of coordinates @xmath148 onto the point of coordinates @xmath149 , computed with respect to the @xmath34-norm .",

    "the multidimensional size functions , with respect to @xmath152 , are able to discriminate the cube and the sphere , while both the @xmath0-dimensional size functions , with respect to @xmath153 and @xmath154 , can not do that .",

    "in a recent paper @xcite , cohen - steiner et al . have introduced the concept of _ vineyard _ , that is a @xmath0-parameter family of persistence diagrams associated with the homotopy @xmath156 , interpolating between @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "these authors assume that the topological space is homeomorphic to the body of a simplicial complex , and that the measuring functions are _",

    "anyway , another interesting link exists between dimension @xmath167 vineyards and multidimensional size functions .",
    "this link is expressed by the following theorem . in order to prove it",

    "for every positive integer number @xmath175 , let @xmath176 be the connected component of @xmath177 containing @xmath49 and @xmath50 . since connected components are closed sets and @xmath36 is compact , each @xmath176 is compact .",
    "the set @xmath178 is the intersection of a family of connected compact hausdorff subspaces with the property that @xmath179 for every @xmath175 , and hence it is connected ( cf .",
    "theorem @xmath180 in @xcite p. @xmath181 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath182 is a subset of @xmath183 and contains both @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath169-connected .",
    "the following lemma allows us to study the behavior of multidimensional size functions near @xmath184 ( where they have not been defined because of instability problems when the measuring functions are not assumed to be tame ) .",
    "[ limit ] let @xmath185 be a size pair . if @xmath186 then @xmath187 is equal to the number @xmath188 of equivalence classes of @xmath189 quotiented with respect to the @xmath190-connectedness relation .",
    "note that , for @xmath191 , @xmath188 simply coincides with @xmath192 .",
    "first of all we observe that the function @xmath193 is nonincreasing in the variable @xmath194 , and hence the value @xmath187 is defined .",
    "the statement of the theorem is trivial if @xmath195 , since , for every @xmath196 , the inequality @xmath197 holds by definition , and hence the equality @xmath198 immediately follows .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath199 . in this case",
    "a finite set @xmath200 of points in @xmath201 exists such that , for every small enough @xmath196 , every @xmath202 is @xmath203-connected to a point @xmath204 in @xmath36 .",

    "therefore @xmath211 .    for @xmath212 $ ] ,",
    "consider the family of size pairs @xmath213 where @xmath156 is a homotopy between @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",

    "we know that @xmath225 is equal to the number of equivalence classes of @xmath226 quotiented with respect to the @xmath227-connectedness relation . on the other hand , lemma [ limit ]",

    "this concludes our proof .",
    "however , although these two links exist , the concept of multidimensional size function has quite different purposes than that of vineyard .",
    "first of all , vineyards are based on a @xmath0-parameter parallel foliation of @xmath120 , while the study of multidimensional size functions depends on a @xmath234-parameter non - parallel foliation of @xmath235 .",
    "in fact , multidimensional size functions are associated with @xmath5-dimensional measuring functions , instead of with a homotopy between @xmath0-dimensional measuring functions .",
    "furthermore , @xcite does not aim to identify distances for the comparison of vineyards , while we are interested in quantitative methods for comparing multidimensional size functions .",
    "in this paper we have proved that the theory of multidimensional size functions can be reduced to the @xmath0-dimensional case by a suitable change of variables .",
    "this equivalence implies that multidimensional size functions are stable , with respect to the new distance @xmath236 , and this allows us to use them in concrete applications by exploiting the existing computational techniques .      * * choice of the foliation .",
    "* other foliations , different from the one we propose are possible . in general",
