    "the flow between concentric cylinders has served as a paradigm for the transition to turbulence since taylors 1923 characterization of the bifurcation from laminar to vortical flows @xcite .",
    "many transitions between spatially and temporally simple flow states like vortices , modulated vortices and traveling waves , are accessible by standard bifurcation theory and have been described and studied in considerable detail @xcite . the turbulent states that are reached after several of these bifurcations are not always homogeneous but",
    "can show patchiness in the form of turbulent spots or turbulent spirals @xcite .",
    "in addition to such azimuthal and axial modulations , coughlin and marcus @xcite have described a radial inhomogeneity for counter - rotating cylinders , which consists of turbulent bursts that have been seen in experiments by colovas and andereck @xcite .",
    "measurements in the twente taylor - couette facility have confirmed the presence of this inhomogeneity up to reynolds numbers of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the onset of this instability has been linked to the maximum in torque that appears for moderate counter - rotation @xcite .",
    "coughlin and marcus @xcite already suggested that this radial inhomogeneity should be linked to the presence of a neutral surface of vanishing angular velocity in the laminar couette profile for counter - rotating cylinders .",
    "the region between the inner cylinder and the neutral surface is inviscidly unstable by the rayleigh criterion , whereas the region between the neutral surface and the outer cylinder is rayleigh stable .",
    "these considerations do not provide an immediate prediction for the onset of inhomogeneity since the neutral surface appears with infinitesimal amounts of counter - rotation already .",
    "we here discuss the extensions needed in order to derive a predictive theory for the onset of this intermittency , compare it with observations for different radius ratios , and describe the link to the torque maxima .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the numerical simulations and describe the phenomenon .",
    "we also identify the onset of intermittency and summarize numerical and experimental results for torque maxima , including a reanalysis of the data of wendt @xcite which is documented in appendix [ sec : wendt ] . in section [ sec : theory ] we present the argument for the boundary layer intermittency , and in section [ sec : lsc ] we describe the link to the torque maximum .",

    "the criteria used to test and verify the code are detailed in @xcite .",
    "specifically , the spatial resolution , characterized by the number of modes @xmath11 in each direction , is chosen so that three convergence criteria are satisfied : torque computed at the inner and outer cylinder has to agree within a relative deviation of @xmath12 , the expansion coefficients in each direction have to cover a range of at least @xmath13 and the energy dissipation estimated from the torque has to agree with the volume energy dissipation rate to within @xmath14 .",
    "all these requirements are met in all simulations shown here .",

    "in order to connect the onset of fluctuations with the rotation ratio for maximal torque and its dependence on the radius ratio , we ask the following questions : ( i ) what is the physical mechanism that determines the onset of fluctuations and can one derive a prediction for the onset from it ? ( ii )",
    "why should the rotation ratio of torque maximization coincide with the onset of fluctuations ?",
    "a first answer to these questions is provided by van gils et al .",

    "( [ eq : bisector ] ) gives .",
    "we here propose an explanation for the onset of fluctuations that is not based on the stability of laminar flow but on properties of turbulent flows in general and turbulent taylor vortices in particular .",
    "the key idea is that the turbulent flow detaches because the inner part that is driven by the rayleigh - unstable region is not sufficiently strong to maintain persistent turbulence across the rayleigh - stable region to the outer cylinder .",
    "but the outer region can not return to laminar for all times , because the turbulent transport and the friction has to be the same , independent of the radial distribution @xcite .",
    "the radial range over which the inner unstable region can maintain a turbulence is somewhat larger than the inner rayleigh - unstable region .",
    "the simple inviscid stability calculations for counter - rotation alluded to before gives a neutral surface at radius @xmath65 that separates stable from unstable flow @xcite and implies a detachment of the unstable flow for any @xmath66 .",
    "however , experiments and viscous calculations show that taylor vortices extent beyond this neutral surface when counter - rotation sets in , see for example @xcite .",

    "the extended range of the inner unstable region as captured by the factor @xmath67 then mandates a minimal counter - rotation for the neutral surface to fall inside the cylinders .",

    "however , to obtain a torque maximum at the bursting onset @xmath36 , additionally , the torque has to increase with @xmath41 decreasing from zero to @xmath102 .",
    "we argue that this increase is caused by a strengthening of the mean taylor vortex flow .",
    "such a large - scale circulation ( lsc ) is able to effectively transport momentum and , thus , to increase the torque in addition to turbulent fluctuations .",
    "the strengthening of the lsc is due to a change in the effective outer boundary condition : while for @xmath103 the lsc seeks to extend beyond the outer cylinder and is restricted by the rigid wall , i.e. @xmath104 , the rigid boundary conditions become replaced by a softer free - surface - like laminar outer boundary layer as @xmath41 approaches @xmath105 .",

    "therefore , we introduced an additional radial average in ( [ eq : g_contrib ] ) to measure the mean weight of each contribution . moreover to accurately capture the mean taylor vortex motion , we axially shift the instantaneous flow fields during the temporal average of @xmath114 and in ( [ eq : g_contrib ] ) so that taylor vortices always stay at a fixed height .    for @xmath115 ,",
    "the torque is mainly caused by turbulent fluctuations and the mean - flow contribution nearly drops to the laminar level , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nupart ] .",
    "turbulent fluctuations also dominate the torque for strong counter - rotation , i.e. @xmath116 for @xmath0 and @xmath117 for @xmath10 . for intermediate rotation ratios , mean - flow vortices ( lsc ) contribute the major share to the torque .",
    "note that the onset of mean vortical flow for @xmath118 , with @xmath119 corresponding to perfect counter - rotation @xmath120 , was previously observed by ravelet et al .",
    "additionally , the lsc contribution grows with @xmath41 decreasing from zero which is consistent with our picture of a change in the outer boundary condition from no - slip to a less restrictive free - surface condition .",
    "the mean taylor vortices are strongest ( as measured by their contribution to the torque ) at the rotation ratio @xmath121 where @xmath122 is maximized . using a quadratic fit with an uncertainty estimation analogue to ( [ eq : uncert ] ) we find @xmath123 consequently , the rotation ratio of optimal momentum transport by the mean flow coincides with the empirically found onset of intermittency , eq .",

    "the analysis presented here support the idea that the torque increases with increasing counter - rotation because the vortices gain in strength until they can no longer sustain turbulence all across the gap .",
