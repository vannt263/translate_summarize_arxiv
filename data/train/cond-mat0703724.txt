    "we suggest the following reason for a possible decrease of @xmath14 : the phase diagram of cuprates is usually interpreted in terms of holes doped into the planar cu@xmath116-o@xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) antibonding band . in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath12 it is assumed that one hole per sr atom enters this band .",
    "however , recent @xmath119 calculations yielded additional features appearing on doping of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath12.@xcite according to these calculations part of the holes occupy the cu@xmath120-o@xmath121 orbitals .",
    "experimentally , the existence of o @xmath122 holes on the @xmath121 orbitals of the apical oxygen were observed for la214 by polarization - dependent fluorescence yield absorption measurements , @xcite and further supported by neutron diffraction studies.@xcite in addition , two superconducting condensates with @xmath88 and @xmath123wave symmetries were recently observed in slightly overdoped la@xmath124sr@xmath125cuo@xmath12.@xcite it was suggested that the @xmath123wave contribution to the total superfluid density arises from the out - of plane band related with the cu@xmath120-o@xmath121 orbitals.@xcite bearing in mind that for each particular hts family the transition temperature @xmath11 is determined by the number of holes in the cuo@xmath3 planes , the smaller superfluid density in na - ccoc in comparison with that in la214 can naturally be explained by a substantial difference in the amount of apical holes in these compounds .",
    "on the 2d superfluid density @xmath126 for na - ccoc and various hole - doped hts s with oxygen on the apical site .",
    "solid red circles and blue stars are na - ccoc data obtained in the present study .",
    "the green circle is the data point for na - ccoc ( @xmath76 ) from ref .  .",

    ", hts s with a small @xmath128 tend to have a high @xmath11 for a given @xmath133 , following the relation @xmath134 . recalling the close similarities between na - ccoc and bi2201 ,",
    "one expects that data points for these two systems would exhibit the same trend ( similar to what is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : uemura ] ) .",
    "it is seen , however , that the data points for na - ccoc , y123 , and la214 ( except the data points for optimally doped and overdoped la214 that are not shown ) almost follow the same curve , while those for bi2201 exhibit a higher 2d superfluid density .",
    "this implies that substitution of cl on the apical site not only leads to a pronounced 2d - like behavior due to a reduction of the coupling between the superconducting cuo@xmath3 planes , but also to a decrease of the transition temperature @xmath11 .",
    "ca@xmath1na@xmath2cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 is a structural analogue to the cuprate superconductor la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath12 with cl atoms replacing oxygen on the apical sites . in order to check the role of the apical oxygen for high - temperature superconductivity",

    "the following results were obtained : the absolute value of the in - plane magnetic penetration depth at @xmath7 was found to increase with decreasing doping from @xmath5=316(19 )  nm for the @xmath9 sample to @xmath5=430(26 )  nm for the @xmath4 one .",
    "comparison of the superfluid density @xmath135 of na - ccoc with that for the structurally related la214 compound reveals that for the same doping level @xmath115 in na - ccoc are is more than a factor of two smaller than in la214 .",
    "the reason for this is very likely due to a substantial decrease of the amount of holes on the apical sites in na - ccoc .",
    "based on a comparison of the three - dimensional [ @xmath114 ] and the two - dimensional [ @xmath126 ] superfluid density of na - ccoc with that of bi2201 it is concluded that replacing apical oxygen by chlorine , first , decreases the coupling between the superconducting cuo@xmath3 planes and , second , leads to a substuntial reduction of the transition temperature @xmath11 . in addition , the appearance and enhancement of magnetism with increasing magnetic field was observed for the optimally doped ca@xmath23na@xmath24cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 sample , suggesting that even optimally doped na - ccoc has a competing magnetic state very close in free energy to its superconducting state . in conclusion ,",
