    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the promising extension of standard model .",
    "if the nature picks up the low energy supersymmetry(susy ) , mssm will be proven _ for sure _ , as superpartners will be copiously produced at future colliders such as large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern or tev scale @xmath0 linear colliders ( lc ) proposed by desy , kek , and slac .",
    "the symmetry also offers natural solution of the hierarchy problem , amazing gauge coupling unification , and dark matter candidates .",
    "on the other hand , the mssm suffers sever flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) constraints if no mass relation is imposed on sfermion mass parameters .",
    "various proposals have been made of the mechanism to incorporate the susy breaking to `` our sector '' , trying to offer the natural explanation of such mass relations . in short",
    ", it would be very surprising if sparticles are found in any future collider the discovery is not the goal , but it is the beginning of a new quest of `` the mechanism '' of susy breaking",
    ". measurements of soft breaking masses would be an important aspects of the susy study at future colliders , because different susy breaking mechanism predict different sparticle mass patterns .    in this talk",
    ", i will review attempts to measure soft breaking parameters at lhc and lc s . in section 2 and 3",
    ", i will concentrate on the process that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are produced and decay , involving the leptonic second lightest neutralino decay @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the decay either proceeds through virtual exchanges of @xmath18 and @xmath19 or direct two body decays such as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "events near the end point of the @xmath4 distribution of the three body decay play a key role to reconstruct the kinematics of @xmath14 and @xmath15 cascade decay chain , and minimal supergravity parameters is determined precisely.@xcite in section 3.1 , i point out the three body decay distribution depends strongly on the decay matrix element .",
    "this dependence may reduce the @xmath4 end point resolution , while the whole shape of @xmath4 distribution could provide information on slepton masses and ino mixings.@xcite i also show a new analysis for the case where @xmath22 decays dominantly into @xmath23.@xcite we point out that the peak position of @xmath24 asymmetry of the same flavor opposite sign ( os ) lepton pairs in @xmath25 region would be independent of @xmath22 momentum distribution , therefore may be used to constraint @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 directly such as the end point of the @xmath4 distribution .",
    "in section 4 , i discuss precision study at future lc s .",
    "thanks to low backgrounds at polarized @xmath0 collider , the machine is perfect to discover and study the superparticles if they are in kinematical reach . furthermore it offers clean tests of relations of soft mass parameters and couplings .",
    "i discuss the radiative correction to the susy coupling relations which can be probed precisely at lc .",
    "the measurement of the deviation from the susy tree level relation offers a way to determine the squark mass scale in the `` decoupling scenario''.@xcite",
    "squarks ( @xmath15 ) and gluinos ( @xmath14 ) will be copiously produced at lhc , and they subsequently decay into charginos ( @xmath26 ) or neutralinos ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "they could further decay into sleptons ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the signal of the sparticle production will be leptons and/or jets with missing @xmath24 if lsp is stable is the lsp . ] .",
    "various study indicates that lhc will find the excess of the sparticle signal if @xmath28 tev in msugra scenarios .",
    "the question is then if we could understand the nature of sparticles in detail .",
    "mssm contains many parameters , on the other hand , the observed signal distributions are sum of products of production cross sections , branching ratios , and acceptances .",
    "the substantial complexities may prevent simple and model independent interpretations .    however some kinematical quantity can be extracted model independently by investigating some characteristic decay distributions .",
    "one of impressive examples is the case studied for snowmass 96 , so called `` lhc point 3 '' .",
    "it is a case that the production of gluino followed by @xmath29 , @xmath30 occurs with substantial branching fraction .",
    "the leptonic decay of the second lightest neutralino @xmath31 occurs with branching fraction of 16% .",
    "the number of @xmath32 jet events then would be around 2.3 m for one year low luminosity run with s / n ratio about 10:1 ; this is substantially larger production ratio compared to typical s - channel sparticle production at lc .",
    "the end point of @xmath4 distribution of os dileptons would be identified as @xmath10 @xmath33 .",
    "the end point could be measured within 50 mev error .    for point 3 ,",
    "@xmath34 events near the @xmath4 end point could be selected for further analysis . in the limit where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is stopped in the rest frame of @xmath8 , therefore @xmath37 in the laboratory frame .",
    "assuming further an approximate msugra relation @xmath38 @xmath39 , one would reconstruct @xmath40 and @xmath41 through the invariant mass distribution of all possible combination of bottom jets and @xmath22 momentum .",
    "this leads to the resolution of msugra parameters @xmath42 gev and @xmath43 gev .",
    "the above analysis showxs that the event distribution ( which in principle depends on hundreds of parameters of mssm model ) could be factrized into a few distributions which sensitively reflects a few parameters of the model . the rest of the distributions will be understood better with the constraints . to this end",
    ", we may be able to provide enough cross checks between events and theoretical calculations ( or mc simulations ) , so that we would be able to use event rates and whole distributions to determine model parameters precisely , or even reject some susy breaking scenarios .",
    "in the previous section , we find the invariant mass distribution of os lepton pairs from @xmath22 decay is the important part of the analysis . in this section",
    "we concentrate on some new aspects on the nature of the decay distribution and discuss the constraints to mssm parameters that would be obtained from the distribution measurement .",
    "three body decays of @xmath45 are dominant as long as two body decays such as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are not open .",
    "the branching ratio of the three body leptonic decay of the second lightest neutralino , @xmath49 , is known to be very sensitive to the values of the underlying mssm parameters .",
    "the dependence is enhanced by the negative interference between the decay amplitude from @xmath18 exchange and that from slepton exchange . in this subsection",
    "we show that the effect of the interference appears not only in the branching ratios , but also in the decay distributions , such as the distribution of the invariant mass @xmath4 of the lepton pairs .",
    "the partial decay width is given by @xmath50 the range of ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) is given by the conditions @xmath53 when @xmath54 .",
    "in the phase space of the decay @xmath49 , the @xmath18 exchange amplitude and @xmath19 exchange amplitude behave differently .",
    "when the @xmath18 contribution dominates , distributions are enhanced in the region of large @xmath55 .",
    "in contrast , when the @xmath19 exchange contribution dominates , distributions are enhanced in regions with large @xmath51 and/or large @xmath52 , therefore in small @xmath4 and large @xmath56 region .",
    "note that @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 are lepton energies in the @xmath45 rest frame .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath61 , a typical case in msugra model . in this case , @xmath45 is wino - like and @xmath36 is bino - like .",
    "an interesting property in this case is that the @xmath18 and @xmath19 amplitudes could be of comparable size in some region of phase space .",
    "furthermore , their interference is generally destructive for leptonic decays .",
    "these effects cause complicated situations , which we discuss below .    for illustration",
    ", we use two sets of parameters for the neutralino sector , ( a ) and ( b ) , shown in table [ nsets ] .    .parameter sets for neutralinos .",
    "all entries with mass units are in gev . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to see the importance of @xmath62 measurement , we first show the expected constraint on @xmath12 and @xmath11 when @xmath10 is fixed , provided that @xmath62 and @xmath63 is measured with the error of 0.07 and 0.5 gev respectively ( fig.4 ) . the error on @xmath12 and @xmath11 could be of the order of 1% , consistent with the previous fits@xcite .",
    "note they did not identify the origin of the peak structure and used _ whole _",
    "@xmath62 distribution for the fit .",
    "the used distribution may depend on parent squark and gluino masses , while our fit relays solely on the peak position , or only on @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "one may also observe the end point of @xmath4 distribution of the three body decay in addition to the edge of the @xmath4 distribution originated from two body cascade decay through slepton .",
    "this is because right handed slepton coupling to wino and higgsino is zero .",
    "the measurements of @xmath64 ( 2 body ) , @xmath65 , and @xmath64 ( 3 body ) @xmath66 @xmath67 are potentially sufficient to determine all sparticle masses involved in the @xmath22 cascade decay . assuming a rather optimistic error on @xmath68 , @xmath69 gev , @xmath11 , @xmath10 , and @xmath12 are constrained within @xmath70 gev , without assuming any relation between ino and slepton masses .",
    "the errors are substantially larger than those shown in fig.4 , due to the correlations between the constraints . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath71 ratio would be constrained strongly .",
    "assuming @xmath72 , @xmath73 gev , @xmath74 gev , we obtain @xmath75 % for @xmath76 , and 7% for @xmath77 .",
    "note that the background in @xmath25 region must be studied to claim the above measurement is possible .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath78 could be important in low @xmath4 region .",
    "note that the full amplitude level study of @xmath79 production has been done for the background process of @xmath22 @xmath80 , and large background is found in @xmath81 gev region@xcite .",
    "however it is unlikely that the background distribution has peak in @xmath82 region .",
    "the peak of the signal distribution may be observed precisely on the top of such backgrounds , especially when signal rate is high enough to allow precision studies .",
    "a tev scale linear colliders could be a powerful discovery machine . in the context of msugra model",
    ", 1 tev lc roughly corresponds to lhc in its discovery potential .",
    "this is because that in the model with universal scalar and gaugino mass at very high scale , relations @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 are predicted naturally . in future lc s ,",
    "search modes are the production and the decay of sleptons , charginos , and neutralinos .",
    "we should also note that lc experiments cover the case where superparticles takes nasty patterns of mass spectrum .",
    "because of the available high beam polarization , backgrounds from @xmath86 boson pair production can be highly suppressed .",
    "notice also that its effective @xmath87 is monochromatic for @xmath0 colliders , therefore @xmath19 and @xmath88 will be produced subsequently from lighter to heavier , and we can measure production cross sections and the decay distributions systematically .",
    "systematical studies of physics potential at lc when slepton , chargino and neutralino are produced have been done in detail by several authors@xcite , and it has been shown that gaugino mass relations , slepton mass relation , and coupling relations can be confirmed with errors of @xmath13 .",
    "in this note , we concentrate on measurements of the coupling relations imposed by supersymmetry , @xmath89 it has been argued that this coupling relation could be measured within @xmath13 accuracy or better by measuring sparticle production cross sections , angular distributions , and sparticle masses involved in the production process @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the couplings is important because the equivalence of the gauge coupling and gaugino coupling is ultimate probe of the supersymmetry at low energy , although the partial discovery of sparticle of course suggests the existence .",
    "another way to say , the existence of ( large ) susy breaking sector couples to ( observed ) sparticles will appear as the deviation of the sparticle coupling from those predicted by the tree level symmetry .",
    "such corrections might come from the existence of squarks which is much heavier than sleptons , charginos or neutralino .",
    "such scenarios , with relatively light third generation squarks are occasionally quoted as `` decoupling '' scenarios , and attractive because they are free from large flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "when such mass spectrum is realized , susy coupling relations do not hold in the effective theory below @xmath90 , and the corrections to the couplings from the tree level predictions are expressed as follows ; @xmath91 if @xmath92-channel exchange of sparticles dominates over @xmath93-channel exchange of gauge bosons , the cross section can be proportional to the 4th power of the coupling , and the correction to the cross section could be around 8% when @xmath94 for sneutrino and wino productions .",
    "a specific example is considered for @xmath95 production with charginos lighter than @xmath96@xcite .",
    "the production is dominated by @xmath92 channel exchange of charginos , and involve the wino - sneutrino - electron coupling . for integrated luminosity around @xmath97 ,",
    "the accepted number of events consisted with @xmath0 and some other jets or leptons activity exceeds more than @xmath98 events . with suitable constraint to @xmath99 and heavier ino masses , @xmath100 would be constrained within 0.09 ( statistics ) @xmath101 0.08 ( sneutrino mass error ) .",
    "behavior of the cross section near the sneutrino production threshold .",
    "chargino threshold production is proportional to @xmath102 and the error due to the mass uncertainty might be controlled better . ]",
    "it would not be very surprising if @xmath103 sparticle events is accumulated in future , with sufficient understanding on underlying parameter of mssm models .",
    "note that different sparticles produced simultaneously , and the proposed tesla integrated luminosity is as large as 1 ab@xmath104= 1000fb@xmath104 . then does this",
    "mean that the production cross sections are measured within o(0.1% ) accuracy ; a few % measurement of the first generation squark masses without producing them ?    apparently , measuring the number of signal events is not equivalent to the measurement of the production cross section",
    ". measured production cross sections suffer various uncertainties , which is schematically given as @xmath105 where @xmath106 may be expressed as @xmath107 the branching ratios may be around @xmath108 and the acceptance could be as high as 50 % . in the right hand side of equation ( [ e12 ] ) , the first line contains errors of underlying mssm parameters that could be negligible in the limit of infinite statistics .",
    "the second line contains machine dependent errors and potentially large and uncontrolled qed and qcd corrections .",
    "they must be very small if we want to extract @xmath109 deviation of cross section , and would require the huge efforts .",
    "in this talk , i discussed a `` precision '' study of supersymmetry in future colliders , lhc and lc .",
    "the motivation of the precision study is to explore the origin of supersymmetry breaking and mechanisms to bring it to our sector .",
    "the signature must appear on the sparticle mass patterns , and would be studied in detail in lhc and lc .    for lhc , charginos and",
    "neutralinos are produced as decay products of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the nature of weak interacting sparticles will be studied . in this talk",
    ", i discussed the decay of the second lightest neutralino .",
    "the leptonic decays of the second lightest neutralino @xmath22 could be studied even though one does not know the parent neutralino momentum .",
    "the @xmath4 distribution of the three body decay is sensitive to neutralino mixing and slepton masses .",
    "if systematical errors can be controlled , one may be able to constrain slepton masses . when the two body decay @xmath110 is open , one would measure the peak of lepton @xmath24 asymmetry in @xmath111 .",
