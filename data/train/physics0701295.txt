    "keldysh - faisal - reiss ( kfr ) theories are very popular to describe nonresonant multiphoton ionization of atoms and molecules in intense laser fields ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "while the principle concept of ignoring the effect of the laser field in the initial state and the interaction of the ionized electron with the remaining atomic system in the final state is common to all kfr approximations , the approaches differ in the details of their formulation .",
    "whereas the length gauge was used in the original work of keldysh  @xcite , the velocity gauge was invoked by reiss  @xcite and faisal  @xcite .",
    "historically , the velocity - gauge variant of kfr theory is also known as strong - field approximation ( sfa )  @xcite .",
    "although this terminology is not consequently adopted nowadays , this meaning of sfa is used in the present work that discusses exclusively the velocity - gauge variant of kfr .",
    "a natural test of kfr theories is a comparison of its prediction in the tunneling limit with the corresponding one of quasistatic theories  @xcite .",
    "the tunneling limit of the length - gauge version of kfr was considered already by keldysh for the explicit example of a hydrogen atom . in the derivation he employed , however , two additional approximations : the one of a small kinetic momentum and the saddle - point method ( spm ) . in his detailed work",
    "@xcite about sfa theory reiss has also used the spm to obtain an approximation for the generalized bessel functions ( asymptotic approximation ) that are required for the calculation of the transition amplitude . as in keldysh work",
    "he also adopted an expansion assuming a small kinetic momentum in order to derive the differential ionization rate in the tunneling limit .",
    "the algebraically cumbersome form of the in  @xcite derived asymptotic approximation has motivated the development of a simpler form appropriate for the tunneling regime .",
    "this approximation  @xcite is again based on the spm and is referred to as tunneling 1 approximation. it was , however , recently criticized by bauer  @xcite who has shown numerically that the tunneling 1 approximation is much worse than the asymptotic approximation in the case of large kinetic momenta .",
    "since neither  @xcite nor  @xcite contain explicit asymptotic expressions in the limit of vanishing laser frequency ( @xmath0 ) , a systematic study of the quasistatic limit on their basis is almost impossible .",
    "recently , the different versions of kfr were numerically compared with quasi - static theories for the hydrogen atom in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that sfa significantly underestimates the ionization rate , especially in the limit @xmath0 or for very strong fields .",
    "since both limits can be well described with quasistatic theories , a comparison of them with the corresponding limit of sfa can provide an insight into the reasons for such a disagreement .",
    "the derivation and analysis of such an asymptotic expression for the sfa ionization rate is the main motivation of this work .",
    "as is shown below , the sfa rate does not converge to the tunneling result , if long - range coulomb interactions are present .",
    "the asymptotic limit of sfa for @xmath0 is also very interesting , because it may be used for deriving a coulomb correction factor by comparing this limiting expression with the one of quasistatic theories .",
    "rescaling the sfa rate ( for @xmath1 ) in such a way that it agrees with the quasistatic limit for @xmath0 is supposed to correct sfa for the otherwise neglected long - range coulomb interaction between the ionized electron and the remaining ion .",
    "such a coulomb correction factor was proposed by becker and faisal ( see @xcite and references therein ) and is extensively used in their atomic and molecular sfa calculations@xcite .",
    "note , this correction factor is in fact very large and can amount to almost three orders of magnitude for atomic hydrogen and standard parameters of intense femtosecond lasers .",
    "although it is emphasized in @xcite that the low - frequency limit of sfa converges to the tunneling result , this is only shown for the case of short - range interactions . as is demonstrated in the present work ,",
    "the correct asymptotic limit of sfa in the presence of long - range coulomb interactions differs from the short - range case even _",
    "qualitatively _ , since it is proportional to @xmath2 , but @xmath2 independent for short - range potentials .",
    "therefore , the present work also allows to directly derive an asymptotically correct coulomb correction factor for sfa .",

    "this can explain the reasonable agreement of the @xmath187-corrected sfa results with the ones of _ ab initio _ calculations reported for such parameters in  @xcite .",
    "however , the deviation increases by a factor 10 for the co@xmath191 laser frequency or for larger @xmath157 .",
    "it may be noted that although  @xcite contains also comparisons with experimental data obtained with a co@xmath191 laser , the present work shows that the found agreement is due to the fact that the comparison is made on a relative scale , as mentioned before . in this case",
    "the erroneous @xmath2 dependence of sfa ( clearly not corrected by the @xmath187 factor ) is , for example , not visible .",
    "as follows from the derivation , @xmath128 in ( [ w_qsfa ] ) is the exact asymptotic form of the sfa ionization rate @xmath73 in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "it is of course interesting to investigate the validity regime of qsfa for non - zero values of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , as is shown now , qsfa provides for a wide range of parameters a good approximation to sfa even for laser wavelengths of around 800 nm or less .",
    "[ fig : ratio_1s ] shows the ratio @xmath192 for the 1s state of a hydrogenlike atom as a function of laser frequency for nine different values of the inverse field parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the variation of @xmath31 is achieved by using three different values for both the binding - energy related quantity @xmath152 and the field intensity @xmath132 .",
    "the ( reference ) ionization rate @xmath73 has been calculated numerically using the scheme described in sec.[subsec : efc ] .",
    "all curves approach unity for @xmath25 indicating the correctness of the derivation of qsfa as well as numerical consistency . in the case of the smallest shown value of the inverse field parameter , @xmath193 ,",
    "one notices that the ratio shows an oscillatory behaviour that is due to channel closings that are not resolved in qsfa .",
    "the oscillation amplitude increases with @xmath2 , but the ratio remains in between about 0.75 and 1.25 in the full frequency range .",
    "therefore , qsfa is correct to within 25% .",
    "if one averages over the oscillations , one finds an even much better quantitative agreement between qsfa and sfa . in view of the fact that the sfa rate is known to overestimate the effect of channel closings and that these pronounced channel closing features mostly disappear when averaging over realistic laser parameters ( envelope , focal volume etc",
    ", the qsfa can be said to provide a very accurate approximation for the given parameters .",
    "note , @xmath194a.u .  corresponds to a laser wave length of about 450 nm and thus the shown frequency range covers a large range of experimentally relevant lasers .",
    "increasing @xmath31 by decreasing @xmath132 ( but keeping @xmath152 fixed ) leads to larger oscillation amplitudes while the oscillation period increases .",
    "most importantly , the average value of the ratio drops with increasing @xmath2 below 1 .",
    "qsfa starts to overestimate the sfa rate .",
    "nevertheless , the oscillation averaged qsfa rate deviates for @xmath195 at 800 nm from sfa by less than 25% .",
    "increasing @xmath31 by increasing @xmath152 ( for fixed @xmath196a.u . )",
    "decreases the oscillation amplitude .",
    "however , the @xmath2 averaged ratio deviates more from unity than for smaller binding energies .",

    "( 27.2ev , he@xmath198 ) changes the ratio at @xmath199a.u .  to about 0.75 and 2.0 ,",
    "respectively . from the representative examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_1s ] one can see that these are general trends .",
    "a decrease of @xmath132 ( fixed @xmath152 ) leads to larger oscillation amplitudes and deviations of the averaged ratio from unity .",
    "this limits the applicability of qsfa to a smaller @xmath2 range .",
    "an increase of the binding energy ( fixed @xmath132 ) damps the oscillation , but increases the deviation from unity . combining both results",
    "it is clear that qsfa works best for small binding energies and high field strengths and thus for small values of @xmath31 .",
    "however , @xmath31 alone is not a sufficient parameter to describe the validity of qsfa , as can be seen from the examples shown for @xmath195 and 5.0 . in this example",
    "qsfa works better for the larger value of @xmath31 that is realized by enlarging both @xmath9 and @xmath132 .    in figs.[fig :",
    "ratio_ns_1 ] and [ fig : ratio_ns_2 ] the validity of the qsfa is investigated for different initial states of hydrogen - like atoms .",
    "this includes all possible states with @xmath131 .",
    "fig.[fig : ratio_ns_1 ] shows the results for @xmath200a.u .  and",
    "these are the same parameters as the ones used for the 1s state in the upper left corner of fig.[fig : ratio_1s ] .",
    "the results in fig.[fig : ratio_ns_2 ] were on the other hand obtained with @xmath202a.u .  and @xmath203a.u .",
    "and correspond therefore to the ones in the middle of fig.[fig : ratio_1s ] . again , all ratios approach unity for @xmath25 as it should be . comparing the results for the s states one notices that the oscillation amplitude increases with @xmath157 , but the deviation of the @xmath2-averaged results is very similar .",
    "the same trend is visible within the p states ( for either @xmath164 or @xmath204 ) . for a given @xmath157 value",
    "the oscillations are most pronounced for @xmath205 and decrease with increasing @xmath155 . in view of the @xmath2-averaged results",
    "the range of validity of the qsfa as a function of @xmath2 shows , however , a weaker dependence on @xmath155 , but is in fact decreasing for increasing @xmath155 . for a given @xmath157 and @xmath155 combination ( 2p@xmath147 and 2p@xmath206 , 3p@xmath147 and 3p@xmath206 , or 3d@xmath147 , 3d@xmath206 , and 3d@xmath191 ) the @xmath2-averaged ratios indicate that the range of validity of the qsfa increases with @xmath156 .",
    "one may notice the close similarity of the results within the series 1s@xmath147 , 2p@xmath206 , and 3d@xmath191 , 2p@xmath147 and 3d@xmath206 , as well as 2s@xmath147 and 3p@xmath206 .",
    "finally , as was the case for the 1s state , also figs.[fig : ratio_ns_1 ] and [ fig : ratio_ns_2 ] show that a larger value of @xmath31 decreases the oscillation amplitude and increases the validity regime of the qsfa .",
    "[ fig : ratio_ns_1 ] shows in addition the ratio of @xmath207 [ see eq.([ap1sfa ] ) ] and @xmath128 . the overall good agreement with the ratio @xmath208 indicates @xmath209 .",
    "clearly , the first step in deriving qsfa is well justified for finite frequencies .",
    "especially , the highly oscillatory behavior of the rate due to channel closings is relatively well reproduced by @xmath207 .",
    "the main reason for the deviation between sfa and qsfa is thus due to step 2 of the derivation which smoothes out the highly oscillatory behavior of the rate if @xmath2 is varied .",
    "it is instructive to investigate the main reason for the failure of qsfa to reproduce sfa for large values of @xmath31 .",
    "it turns out that for large @xmath31 it is most essential to consider in eq.([isup ] ) also the terms proportional to @xmath127 .",

    "[ fig : cor_qsfa ] shows a direct comparison of @xmath73 and @xmath139 ( both scaled by @xmath140 ) for those two case where qsfa failed most severely for the 1s state of a hydrogenlike atom , @xmath212a.u .  and @xmath213 or 0.1a.u .",
    "besides the oscillatory behavior of sfa that is also not reproduced in the corrected qsfa , the overall agreement is very good , even if the rate varies by many orders of magnitude , if @xmath2 changes from 0 to 0.1a.u .",
    "the results of the corrected qsfa are not only interesting for improving the qsfa , but they also confirm once more that the two steps made in the derivation of the qsfa are justified .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that the range of applicability of eq.([cqsfa ] ) is not restricted to a range of parameters that according to the keldysh parameter @xmath144 belongs to the quasistatic regime ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "[ fig : cor_qsfa ] shows that it works even for @xmath215 .",
    "the sfa ( kfr theory in velocity gauge ) was studied both analytically and numerically in the quasistatic limit . the derived analytical asymptotic expression ( qsfa )",
    "shows that in the presence of long - range coulomb interactions and thus for ionization of neutral or positively charged atoms or molecules the sfa rate is proportional to the laser frequency in this limit .",
    "this evidently unphysical result indicates a break - down of the sfa .",
    "furthermore , this result shows that in contrast to the case of short - range potentials the sfa rate does not converge to the tunneling limit for weak fields , if long - range coulomb interactions are present .",
    "the analytical result is supported by a numerical study for which an efficient scheme for the numerical evaluation of the sfa transition amplitude has been developed .",
    "using different states of hydrogenlike atoms as an example , the predictions of the original sfa and the qsfa are compared to each other .",
    "it is found that qsfa allows for a rather accurate prediction of the sfa rate even for finite laser frequencies extending in some favorable cases to wavelengths of 500 nm and below .",
    "it is shown that the validity regime of the qsfa can even be extended using a correction factor that is explicitly derived for 1s states .",
    "the large range of applicability of the qsfa is of practical interest , since its numerical evaluation is simpler than the one of the original sfa rate , especially in the ir and far - ir frequency regime .",
    "furthermore , it is very convenient for studies of the frequency dependence of the sfa rate , since the qsfa is , besides a simple proportionality factor , @xmath2 independent .",
    "thus the qsfa has to be evaluated for a given system and field strength only once . in turn",
    ", the relatively large range of laser frequencies in which qsfa and sfa agree demonstrates that also the sfa rate itself is in a wide range of laser parameters only proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "an exception is the pronounced @xmath2 dependence due to channel closings that is not reproduced by qsfa .    on the basis of a comparison of the qsfa result with the prediction of the popov - peremolov - terentev ( ppt ) formula a coulomb correction factor",
    "is derived .",
    "this factor is compared to a previously proposed one that was supposed to be successfully adopted in a wide range of calculations .",
    "it is discussed that part of this success may be due to the fact that the comparisons to experimental data was only possible on a relative scale . in this case",
    "a number of important terms missing in the previously proposed coulomb correction factor is not visible .",
    "the goal of this work has been the derivation of an anlytical expression for the sfa in the quasistatic limit in the presence of long - range coulomb interactions and a discussion of the resulting qsfa in comparison to sfa .",
