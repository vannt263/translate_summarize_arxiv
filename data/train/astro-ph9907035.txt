    "much observational evidence has been accumulated since the first discovery of luminous ( infrared luminosities of @xmath6 , `` lirgs '' ) and ultraluminous ( @xmath7 , `` ulirgs '' ) infrared galaxies to suggest that their interstellar medium ( ism ) is quite different from that of normal galaxies .",
    "ulirgs and lirgs contain very large quantities of molecular gas , as traced by co ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) , and by tracers of high density gas such as hcn and cs(3 - 2 ) ( solomon , downes & radford 1992 ) . in spite of their abundance of molecular hydrogen ,",
    "lirgs have ratios of far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity to molecular gas mass , @xmath8 , that largely exceed those measured in our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the luminosity of the high - density tracers and @xmath9 , however , is quite normal .",
    "the fir emission is a measure of the star formation activity in a galaxy and so the constant @xmath10 implies that the star formation rate ( sfr ) per _ dense _ gas mass is normal .",
    "the ratio of the luminosity of the high - density gas tracers to co is much higher than in our own galaxy , and so it would appear that a larger fraction of the molecular gas is in a dense state .",
    "solomon et al .",
    "conclude from this that the ism of ulirgs is much denser than in normal galaxies , with even gas in intercloud regions being in the molecular state .",
    "the dust properties of lirgs are also different from those found in less luminous galaxies .",
    "there are a number of strong indications that the dust opacity in lirgs is very high , with the result that the emission from lirgs is optically thick even in the fir wavelength range . based on the tight correlation between the flux at 100 @xmath0 m and the co emission of ulirgs , solomon et al .",
    "argue that the ism is optically thick at wavelengths as long as 100 @xmath0 m . a high opacity in arp 220",
    "is supported by a range of observations : ( i ) emerson et al .",
    "have concluded from observations in the ir and submillimetre that the dust opacity is of order unity between 100 and 200 @xmath0 m .",
    "( ii ) from observations with iso using the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) fischer et al . derived unity optical depth at @xmath11 m .",
    "( iii ) the ratios of the ir fine structure line emission observed by iso @xcite are consistent with a screen opacity of @xmath12 mag , equivalent to an opacity of @xmath13 mag if the dust and gas were well - mixed .",
    "( iv ) calculations by downes & solomon using measurements of the co surface brightness and a galactic dust - to - gas ratio suggest an opacity of about @xmath13 mag .",
    "the dust opacity is also high in ngc 4418 , where a high dust extinction has been measured at optical wavelengths ( @xmath14 mag , roche et al .",
    "the high dust opacity might also explain why the c@xmath15 158 @xmath0 m line is so weak in ulirgs ( malhorta et al .",
    "1997 , luhman et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "an accurate measurement of the molecular gas mass of a galaxy is critical to determining star formation activity . estimating the molecular gas mass of an object is not straightforward , and is typically made in one of two ways : the first method relies on observations of the optically thick co(1 - 0 ) emission .",
    "the calculated co line luminosity can be converted to a @xmath16 gas mass by adopting a conversion factor between co and @xmath16 that has been derived from observations of galactic molecular clouds ( e.g. young & scoville 1982 ) and @xmath17-rays fluxes @xcite .",
    "the second method makes use of the empirical relationship between gas and dust mass .",
    "the dust mass can be determined from the dust emission spectrum with assumptions made about the dust emissivity and composition .",
    "the dust mass can in turn be converted into a molecular gas mass using the locally derived gas - to - dust mass ratio ( e.g. hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "both derivations assume that the dust and gas parameters derived from measurements in our own galaxy are valid under the quite different conditions in lirgs , and that they are independent of star formation activity .",
    "theoretical arguments by maloney & black suggest that the co - to - h@xmath18 conversion factor should be considerably lower in actively star forming galaxies because of the higher density and temperature of the constituent molecular clouds .",
    "observationally , there are also indications that the galactic co - to - h@xmath18 conversion factor overestimates the molecular gas mass in lirgs : shier , rieke & rieke find that the molecular gas mass derived from co emission using the standard galactic conversion factor exceeds the dynamical mass by a factor of 4  10 .",
    "similarly , solomon et al . conclude from comparisons of the dynamical and gas mass derived from the fir emission and the co , that the galactic conversion factor between the co luminosity , @xmath19 , and the molecular gas mass , @xmath20 , overestimates @xmath20 by a factor of about 5 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by a better determination of the dynamical mass of a sample of ulirgs using high angular resolution observations made with the plateau de bure interferometer @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report on observations of the 850 @xmath0 m emission for a sample of 19 lirgs galaxies using the submillimetre - wave continuum bolometer array , scuba @xcite , at the jcmt .",
    "the aim of these observations has been twofold : firstly , to study the dust emission from a selection of galaxies believed to have an ism quite different to that of our own galaxy , and secondly , to compare the molecular gas mass derived from the dust emission at 850 @xmath0 m with that derived from co measurements in order to assess whether the assumptions on which both methods rely are valid for galaxies spanning a wide range of different star formation activities .",
    "the large field of view of scuba enables us to include any extended dust emission and to measure its size . in this way we are able to avoid the limitations of previous studies made with single - pixel bolometers ( e.g. andreani & franceschini 1996 , lisenfeld et al .",
    "the sample consists of 19 galaxies selected from the subsample of the bright iras galaxies observed in co(1 - 0 ) with the nrao 12 m telescope by sanders et al . .",
    "the combination of the large co beam ( 55  ) and the small optical diameter of our sample means that no co emission has been missed .",
    "the galaxies were selected to cover a wide range of infrared luminosities ( @xmath21 ) where the fluxes are in jy . ] and infrared - to - blue - luminosity ratios @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , thus sampling a wide range of luminosities and star formation activities ( as traced by @xmath22 ) .",
    "the galaxies were mapped in service time with scuba at the jcmt between july 1997 and april 1998 .",
    "the 16-jiggle mode was used for the observations to obtain fully sampled maps at 850 @xmath0 m ; the weather conditions were too poor in order to make use of the 450 @xmath0 m data that was obtained parallely .",
    "the chop throws ranged betweeen 60  and 120  ( see table 1 ) and the integration time per map was between 15 and 70 minutes .",
    "the sky opacity at 850 @xmath0 m varied between 0.2 and 0.45 .",
    "the data were reduced using the software package surf @xcite .",
    "the data were flatfielded , extinction - corrected and despiked , with bad bolometers and bad channels removed prior to rebinning and flux calibration .",
    "flux calibration was achieved using uranus and the secondary calibrators crl  618 , irc+10216 , oh231.8 . the conversion factor between volts and jy was found to be quite consistent over different nights , with an average value of @xmath24 jy / v .",
    "listed in table 1 are the measured 850 @xmath0 m fluxes ( column 6 ) together with 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath0 m iras fluxes taken from the iras faint source catalog .",
    "the flux errors given in column 6 represent the noise in the maps , @xmath25 .",
    "the total error , @xmath26 , used for the model fitting , takes additional account of the estimated calibration error , @xmath27 , of an estimated 20 per cent : @xmath28 .",
    "fourteen of the nineteen galaxies were detected at 850 @xmath0 m , with 3@xmath25 upper limits of between 50 and 200 mjy obtained for the remaining five galaxies .",
    "these upper limits have been computed under the assumption that the angular size of the galaxy is small compared to the beam ; if considerable extended emission is present , the total fluxes could be higher .",
    "we have found extended emission for ngc 5653 and ngc 5936 . for ngc 5653",
    "a gaussian fit yielded a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of 17  , whereas the shape of ngc 5936 is rather irregular with a maximum diameter of about 40  . in the case of ngc 1614 and ngc 3110",
    "there could be extended emission present , but the noise level of our data is not low enough in order to definitely confirm this . for the other galaxies we determined the source sizes to have a fwhm of less than 8  .",
    "the flux at 850 @xmath0 m was determined as the integrated flux over the source extension .",
    ".fir and submillimetre data [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the molecular gas mass can be calculated from the 850 @xmath0 m emission :    @xmath29    where optically thin dust emission at 850 @xmath0 m is assumed ( this is correct even for the high dust opacities estimated in the previous section ) .",
    "we have adopted temperatures derived in the best - fit @xmath30 models .",
    "we have used the value for @xmath31 given by hildebrand which , for @xmath32 and for a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 150 , is @xmath33 . for comparison with other authors ,",
    "this value can be extrapolated to 1.3 mm , where we obtain ( for @xmath32 ) @xmath34 .",
    "based on extensive simulations of dust emission and absorption krgel , steppe & chini estimate @xmath35 .",
    "mezger , wink & zylka suggest a value of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a measure of the dust environment and @xmath38 is the metallicity . adopting a value of @xmath39 for moderately dense gas yields ( for @xmath40 ) a value of @xmath34 , which matches the value adopted in this paper . in contrast",
    ", the `` standard '' dust model of draine & lee gives a somewhat lower value of @xmath41 , which has been found to agree with observational comparisons between dust extinction at ir wavelength and dust emission at fir / mm wavelength in dense galactic molecular cloud cores ( kramer et al .",
    "1998 , lehtinen et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the most significant uncertainty in this method , apart from @xmath31 , is the dust temperature .",
    "the error in the dust temperature can be estimated by comparing the temperatures derived in the different models ( optically thin / thick , single temperature or various temperature components ) used here , which differ by about 50 per cent . at submillimetre wavelengths the planck function depends linearly on the dust temperature",
    ", so this uncertainty in the dust temperature produces an error in @xmath4 of 50 per cent also . adding to this quadratically the measurement error of the 850 @xmath0 m flux densities ( on average 25 per cent ) , we estimate an error of 55 per cent for @xmath4 .      in fig .",
    "5 we show the comparison between the molecular gas mass derived from the co emission , @xmath5 , and the molecular gas mass derived from the 850 @xmath0 m continuum , @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is systematically higher than @xmath4 .",
    "a good correlation ( correlation coefficient @xmath42 ) exists between the two quantities , spanning nearly 2 orders of magnitude .    in fig .",
    "6 we have plotted the ratio between the molecular gas mass derived using the two alternative methods as a function of @xmath43 and as a function of @xmath22 to see whether there is any trend with luminosity or the star formation activity . the error of @xmath44 is the root of the sum of the squares of the errors in @xmath5 and @xmath4 , and so approximately 60 per cent . the average ratio , @xmath44 is @xmath45 , ignoring upper limits .",
    "there is no trend visible for @xmath44 to vary with @xmath43 .",
    "there might be a weak anticorrelation in the lirg sample between @xmath44 and @xmath22 , but the statistical significance is low and a larger sample size will be needed in order to confirm or refute this anticorrelation .    also plotted in fig .",
    "6 are data taken from the literature for other galaxies , including spiral galaxies ( ngc 3637 , ngc 891 ) and actively star forming and starburst galaxies ( markarian galaxies , ngc 253 ) .",
    "the @xmath44 ratios for these comparison galaxies have been rederived using the same parameters as for the lirg sample .",
    "the most significant differences between the lirg sample and these other galaxies is seen in the spiral galaxies ngc 891 ( factor of 3.3 ) the starburst galaxy ngc 253 has about the same ratio as the average of the lirgs , while the markarian galaxies have a lower value , possibly due in part to the fact that @xmath5 has been derived from the co(2 - 1 ) line emission assuming a ratio of co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) of 1 .    we have found for the lirg sample that the molecular gas mass derived from the co is higher than that derived from the 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "this confirms the conclusion of other authors , that the standard galactic co - to - molecular mass conversion factor overestimates the molecular gas mass in lirgs",
    ". the resultant ratio of @xmath44 is slightly less than that seen in other studies , the results of which suggest that the co emission overestimates the molecular gas mass by a factor of about 4 - 5 ( solomon et al .",
    "1997 , downes & solomon 1998 ) or more ( factor 3 - 10 , shier et al .",
    "1994 , braine & dumke 1998 ) .",
    "if this higher value is true , it implies that the molecular gas mass derived from the 850 @xmath0 m flux is also an overestimate",
    ". this could be possibly due to a higher dust - to - gas mass ratio in these galaxies which could be caused by the higher metallicity produced by intense star formation as seen in galactic nuclei and bulges , for example in the inner part of m  51 @xcite and the centre of ngc 253 @xcite .",
    "we have presented new data at 850 @xmath0 m taken with scuba at the jcmt for 19 luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "fourteen galaxies were detected at a level of 5@xmath26 or better . using the 850@xmath0 m data as well as iras fluxes taken from the literature",
    ", we have shown that the submillimetre / far - infrared spectral energy distribution for the majority of the sources in the sample is well - described by an optically thin , single temperature dust model , with @xmath2",
    ". a lower value of @xmath46 is required to fit the data for two of the galaxies , arp 220 and ngc 4418 .",
    "this difference can be attributed to one , or a combination of : ( i ) different intrinsic dust properties , ( ii ) the presence of a large cold - dust component , ( iii ) high dust opacities .",
    "we have discussed the various possibilities and conclude that the most physical explanation is a high dust opacity .",
    "we have compared the molecular gas masses derived from the dust emission to the molecular gas masses derived from the co emission of our sample .",
    "we find , on average , that @xmath5 is a factor of 23 higher than @xmath4 .",
    "if the co luminosity indeed overestimates the gas mass by a factor of about 5 - 10 as indicated by other studies , then the dust emission must also overestimate the gas mass .",
    "the most likely reason for this is a higher dust - to - gas mass ratio in lirgs .",
    "we would like to thank the staff at the jach for carrying out the observations , rob ivison for useful advices with respect to the data analysis and and loretta dunne for allowing us to compare our results with observations made in the scuba local universe and galaxy survey prior to publication .",
