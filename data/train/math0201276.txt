    "we present three major steps towards our goal .",

    "[ linkthm ] for two linking data @xmath17 and @xmath74 of finite cartan type for a finite abelian group @xmath18 which only differ in their choice of the @xmath30 we have that @xmath40 and @xmath75 are quasi - isomorphic .",
    "the strategy of the proof is as follows .",
    "we will prove the statement for an arbitrary linking datum and the datum where all the @xmath30 are 0 .",
    "this will be achieved inductively by proving the statement for an arbitrary linking datum with at least one pair of linked vertices and one datum with the same data , except that the number of connected components that are not linked to any other vertex is increased by one .",
