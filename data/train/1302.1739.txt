    "@xcite a considerable amount of work has been devoted to the investigation of electron - atom scattering in the presence of a powerful laser field .",
    "reviews on this topic can be found on the theoretical side in a survey by one of the present authors @xcite and on the experimental situation in a summary given by mason @xcite .",
    "further details can also be found in the books by mittleman @xcite and by faisal @xcite , as well as in the work by gavrila @xcite . initially the atomic target was described by a static potential but starting with the work of gersten and mittleman @xcite the laser dressing of the target was taken into account , treating the radiation - atom interaction perturbatively . along the same lines work was published by zon @xcite , beilin and zon @xcite and , in particular , by joachain and co - workers in several consecutive papers @xcite-@xcite as well as by maquet and co - workers @xcite-@xcite . in all these investigations a linearly polarized @xmath1 laser field was considered .",
    "more recently , it became of interest to analyze in some detail the case of a circularly polarized @xmath2 laser field @xcite-@xcite to find out , in particular , whether for @xmath3 the nonlinear scattering cross sections depend explicitly on the _ dynamical _ _ phase _ @xmath4 and the _ helicity _ of the radiation field .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to investigate free - free transitions on a hydrogen atom for a @xmath3 laser field .",
    "the scattering process is treated in the first order born approximation and the target - dressing by the radiation field is taken into account in second order perturbation theory .",
    "it will be explicitly shown that in this case the nonlinear differential cross sections depend neither on the _ dynamical _ _ phase _ @xmath4 nor on the _ helicity _ of the radiation field . in section",
    "ii we shall start our investigations by considering free - free transitions in a cp laser field on a laser - dressed model potential in order to define the essential parameters of the process .",
    "we shall then investigate in section iii in greater detail and generality the effects of atomic dressing evaluating first and second order radiative corrections to the bound state .",
    "section iv will be devoted to a discussion of our numerical results for the angular distribution and the frequency dependence of the nonlinear signals in electron - hydrogen scattering in @xmath3 laser field .",
    "comparison will be made between these signals for @xmath3 and those for @xmath5 fields and the main differences encountered will be analyzed .",
    "the final section will summarize our findings .",

    "the second term in eq.([pot ] ) describes approximately the interaction between the electron and the atomic dipole moment induced by the field .",
    "an effective laser - dressed potential of the form eq.([pot ] ) was already used by several authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for @xmath5 fields .",

    "is @xmath17 @xmath18 are volkov solutions , which describe the projectile in the initial and final state , respectively .",
    "since the volkov state is written in the velocity gauge , while the electron - dipole interaction in eq.([pot ] ) is written in the length gauge , a gauge factor would have to be introduced for consistency reasons . in the present approximation ,",
    "however , the gauge factors drop out in eq.([s - pol ] ) .    for an electron of kinetic energy @xmath19 and momentum @xmath20",
    ", the volkov solution reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the classical oscillation of the electron in the electric field @xmath23 . in the case of the above @xmath3 laser field this quiver motion is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",

    "one can see that , apart from the arguments of the bessel functions ( @xmath39 instead of @xmath99 ) , the only difference between eqs .",
    "( [ cs ] ) and ( [ lp ] ) concerns the angular parts ( @xmath100 instead of @xmath101 ) .",

    "our equations ( [ cs ] ) and ( [ lp ] ) emphasize the importance of the geometrical relation between the momentum transfer of the scattering electron and the polarization vector . to make the discussion clear",

    "once we have established these correspondences , we can make a couple of remarks concerning the relations between laser assisted signals in @xmath3 and @xmath5 laser fields .",
    "we shall always refer to @xmath5 and @xmath3 which are connected to each other by eq.([geo ] ) .",
    "the first remark concerns the difference between the laser assisted signals in @xmath5 and @xmath3 in the case of the elastic term ( @xmath36=0 ) . for low frequencies , in the forward direction ,",
    "the laser assisted signal is smaller in @xmath3 than in @xmath5 and the difference is given by @xmath118 in any of the three related configurations .",
    "the second remark is more general and it is valid for any photon frequency . for weak laser fields at any scattering angles and for moderate laser intensities at small scattering angles , i.e. whenever the arguments of the bessel functions are small ,",
    "the following relation exists for @xmath119 @xmath120    this relation is of particular interest since for @xmath121 one can recover in this way the perturbative limit given by @xmath122 the same expression can be obtained by using eqs.(14 - 16 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "one should keep in mind that in that paper the photon energy was expressed in rydbergs and that eq.(7 ) of the same paper ( devoted to excitation processes ) should be modified for free - free transitions by putting @xmath123 . in the weak field limit",
    "we find out that , on account of the relations eq.([geo ] ) , the laser assisted signal involving one @xmath3 photon ( absorbed / emitted ) will be always one half of the corresponding signal for @xmath5 . for higher intensities , the deviations from this relation appear as a signature of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we shall show in this section that by adding second or higher order terms in the expansion ( [ fun ] ) we get no change in our main conclusion that neither the dynamical phase @xmath124 nor the photon helicity are relevant parameters in free - free transitions at high scattering energies .",
    "if the second order correction , @xmath125 in eq.([fun ] ) , is added to the wave function that describes the ground state of hydrogen in the laser field , we get the third contribution to the transition matrix element in eq.([tm - cp ] ) . after integration over the coordinates of the projectile",

    "as long as the scattering is treated in first order born approximation , the helicity will remain an unobservable parameter .",
    "it is interesting to note that the weak field limit of the differential cross section for two @xmath3 photon absorption / emission has a simple angular dependence given by @xmath152 .",
    "indeed , one finds @xmath153    on the contrary , for @xmath5 fields where @xmath154 , the atomic matrix element @xmath128 has a different angular behavior given by @xmath155 .\\ ] ] the amplitudes @xmath134 and @xmath156 depend on the momentum transfer of the scattered electron and on the four parameters @xmath157 and @xmath87 , given in eqs.([tau1 ] ) and ( [ tau2 ] ) .",
    "finally , in the weak field domain , this leads to the following expressions for the differential cross sections for two photon absorption / emission in lp fields @xmath158",
    "in this section we illustrate our results by considering the numerical evaluation of the nonlinear differential cross sections for the elastic term ( @xmath45 ) and the next two sidebands ( @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) .",
    "we focus our discussion on the geometries denoted earlier by * cp3 * and * lp3 * because in these geometries the coupling between the laser field and the colliding system is particularly strong .",
    "the angular distributions of the scattered electrons with final energies given by @xmath161 are shown in figure 1 for the three values of @xmath36 : 0 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "we have chosen two frequencies in the optical domain , namely @xmath162=5 ev and @xmath162=2  ev and our results are evaluated for the laser field strength @xmath12=10@xmath163 v / cm and the initial scattering energy @xmath164=100 ev .    in the left hand panels",
    "@xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 of figure 1 the laser frequency is @xmath162=5 ev and the quiver amplitude , @xmath168 , takes the value 0.58 a.u . , corresponding to the perturbative regime . in panel @xmath165 , at small scattering angles where the dressing of the target is important , the differential cross section @xmath169 exceeds the field - free signal for both linear and circular polarizations .",
    "the nonlinear signals , @xmath170 , belonging to the final energy @xmath171=105 ev are presented in panel @xmath166 . here",
    "we recognize that for small arguments of the bessel functions the assisted signals for @xmath3 have half the value of the signals for @xmath5 .",
    "finally , in panel @xmath167 we find large differences between the @xmath3 and @xmath5 signals .",
    "to understand this different behavior we focus on the dominant contributions to the differential cross sections , given by ( [ pers ] ) and ( [ perl ] ) , respectively .",
    "moreover , we note that only @xmath156 of eq.([perl ] ) has a pole at @xmath172=2 while it does not appear in eq.([pers ] ) .",
    "hence it becomes clear that the enhancement of the @xmath5 signal originates in a two photon virtual transition between the ground state and the first excited state ( e@xmath173-e@xmath174=10.2 ev ) .",
    "considerations of angular momentum algebra can be used to show that such transitions are forbidden if the two photons have circular polarization .    in figure 1",
    "( panels @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 ) we also present the angular distributions for the second laser frequency , @xmath162=2 ev . in this case the amplitude of the quiver motion takes the value @xmath168=3.6 a.u . and",
    "the nonlinear dynamical behavior becomes apparent .",
    "therefore the angular distributions are considerably different from those of the previous case .",
    "we point out that our formula ( [ dif1 ] ) reproduces quite well the differences between @xmath5 and @xmath3 signals for @xmath36=0 , since here second order corrections are of minor importance .",
    "for @xmath36=1 the @xmath3 signals are again one half of the @xmath5 ones at small scattering angles , as is shown in the window inserted in panel @xmath166 . with increasing scattering angle ,",
    "the argument of the bessel functions increases and nonlinear contributions become important .",
    "the present frequency , @xmath162=2 ev , is too small for establishing a two - photon resonance and the chosen intensity is not strong enough for higher order contributions .",
    "therefore @xmath5 and @xmath3 signals remain comparable for @xmath36=2 .",
    "we think that the differences between our data for @xmath162=2 ev and those published earlier for the same parameters @xcite are due to spurious phase effects present in the calculations of that work .",
    "we shall next discuss the resonance structure of the first ( @xmath36=1 ) and of the second ( @xmath36=2 ) sidebands considering a sufficiently small scattering angle , @xmath178=5@xmath179 , such that the target dressing effects are relevant .    in figure 2",
    "the resonance structures of @xmath170 are shown for one photon absorption in the geometry * cp3*. we restrict ourselves to the weak field domain and we normalize the signals with respect to the intensity of the laser field . the differential cross sections exhibit a number of resonance peaks corresponding to @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the binding energy of the ground state and @xmath182 is the principal quantum number .",
    "they correspond to the poles in the analytic expression of @xmath84 in eq.([jal ] ) . at very low frequencies",
    "the major contribution stems from the bunkin - fedorov term ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the first minimum of the differential cross sections , close to @xmath162=2 ev , comes from an interference between the atomic and the electronic term ; the other minima , located between two consecutive resonances , are related to the contribution of the first order dressing correction to the ground state in eq.([fun ] ) . since the relation , eq.([dif2 ] ) , holds in the perturbative domain , the resonance structures for the related scattering geometry , * lp3 * , are obtained by a vertical upshift of these curves by a factor @xmath183 .",

    "one photon resonances are located above 10.2 ev as discussed earlier .",
    "in addition , a second series of resonances , located between 5.1 and 6.8 ev , is predicted .",
    "it corresponds to _ two _ photon virtual transitions to excited states .",
    "this further series of resonances is related to second order corrections to the ground state ( [ fun ] ) and is presented in our figure 3 .",
    "the panel @xmath184 refers to the geometry * cp3 * , while the other one to the geometry * lp3*. as discussed before , the resonance located at @xmath162=5.1 ev is present for @xmath5 only .",
    "one can explicitly see in our figures that the dressing effects are increasing for increasing frequencies of the laser beam .",
    "in the present work we have investigated scattering of electrons by hydrogen atoms in the presence of a circularly polarized laser field . for comparison , we also considered linearly polarized laser light .",
    "since we assumed the scattered electrons to have initially some @xmath185 ev kinetic energy , we were permitted to treat the scattering process in first order born approximation .",
    "the laser dressing of the atomic target was treated in second order perturbation theory , while that of the scattering electron was described by a volkov solution . within this approximation scheme",
    ", we were able to show that the nonlinear cross sections @xmath186 neither depend on the dynamical phase @xmath187 , contrary to what was predicted by earlier work on this topic @xcite,@xcite , nor is there any indication of circular dichroism . in our derivation of the above findings we devoted particular attention to the proper definition of the phases in graf s addition theorem of bessel functions , basing our considerations on the corresponding definitions in watson s book @xcite .",
    "this was outlined , in particular , in section ii of this work . as we found out",
    ", it is very crucial to make a careful analysis of the phase relations in the above treatment for otherwise quite easily spurious phase dpendences can creep in to finally simulate circular dichroism in the process studied above . besides , we took advantage of our analysis to also make a comparison between nonlinear electron - atom scattering in a circularly and a linearly polarized laser beam of equal frequency and intensity . among other differences between these two cases , we were able to show that for weak fields , at any scattering angles , and for moderate fields , at small scattering angles , @xmath188 are always smaller than @xmath189 .",
    "moreover , the resonance structures of the two cross sections are different , in particular , there are more resonances in the linear than in the circular case . although one can qualitatively understand these differences by using angular momentum considerations , we have explicitly shown in the appendix how the additional resonance in the case of linear polarization comes about .",
    "nevertheless , we should stress that a possible phase dependence may occur if the scattering process is treated beyond the first order born approximation @xcite . in this case",
    "the appearance of imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude may lead to phase dependences and eventually circular dichroism in the scattering of electrons by atoms in circularly polarized laser light . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we shall show that , for a particular laser configuration , circular dichroism due to the target dressing can be predicted for high scattering energies , choosing the laser frequency and the scattering geometry in an appropriate way .",
    "in order to evaluate analytically the atomic matrix element @xmath190 in eq.(50 ) we use the expressions of the linear and quadratic response given in refs.@xcite and@xcite , respectively .",
