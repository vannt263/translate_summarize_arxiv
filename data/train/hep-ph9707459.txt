    "@xmath20 denotes the _ subtraction _ terms which removes the potential heavy quark collinear singularities from @xmath19 .",
    "the physical cross section @xmath21 is scheme independent .",
    "the choice of subtraction @xmath20 defines the scheme , and hence the parton distributions @xmath22 and their associated splitting functions @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , to this order these terms are connected by the relation : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 perturbative distribution of @xmath27 in @xmath28 . for the complete @xmath15",
    "we have : @xmath29 near threshold ( @xmath30 ) , we have @xmath31 which reflects the fact that @xmath32 , by construction . this yields @xmath33 independent of the specific choice of scheme @xmath8 , and therefore independent of the choice of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this is the key mechanism that compensates the different effects of the mass - independent _ vs. _ mass - dependent evolution , and yields a @xmath10 which is identical up to higher - order terms .",
    "ref.@xcite strongly advocated the use of mass - dependent evolution of the parton distributions , and questioned the correctness of using the familiar  mass - independent evolution in ref .",
    "@xcite . is this criticism justified ?",
    "no  provided the proper matching between the hard scattering cross sections and the parton distributions is observed .",
    "although the acot scheme chose to use a _ mass - independent _",
    "evolution for its simplicity and natural connection to the familiar zero - mass parton results , this choice is not an approximation  the physical predictions are insensitive to this choice .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate this by implementing a mass - dependent evolution scheme in the same formalism , and compare the new results with the existing mass - independent acot calculation . in the next section",
    ", we shall compare this new massive calculation with that of mrrs .    in fig .  1 we display the separate contributions to @xmath36 for both mass - independent and mass - dependent evolution .",

    "the lesson is clear : the choice of a mass - independent  or a mass - dependent ( non- ) evolution is purely a choice of scheme , and becomes simply a matter of convenience_there is no physically new information gained from the mass - dependent evolution . _",
    "a necessary consistency check of any proposed general mass scheme in the important intermediate energy region is that it yield the correct limits for threshold and asymptotic energies .",
    "although this feature is , in principle , built into the formalism discussed in eq .",
    "[ eq : sub ] , it is essential to verify that the expected behavior actually appears in specific implementation of the scheme  in particular , near the threshold region where the required cancellation between the @xmath37 and @xmath38 terms is delicate    fig.2 compares @xmath36 _ vs. _ the physical variable @xmath40 using the same charm mass , scale choice , and format of an existing mrrs plot , ( _ cf .",
    "_ fig.6b , ref.@xcite ) . in fig.2a",
    ", @xmath39 smoothly interpolates between @xmath41 in the threshold region , and @xmath37 in the high energy region , demonstrating the desired matching .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding curve in fig.2b ( taken from ref.@xcite ) shows a sudden rise at threshold which indicates a lack of expected cancellation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 just above threshold .",
    "since both calculations use the same ( mrrs ) evolution kernel , this difference can only be due to the implementation of the subtraction procedure : fig.2a uses the general mass formalism described above,@xcite ; fig.2b uses the procedure described in",
    "irrespective of smoothness of the theory calculation , a physical prediction must be stable against the choice of artificial theoretical parameters such as the renormalization and factorization scale @xmath42 .",
    "fig.3a shows our calculation ( again , using the mass - dependent evolution ) with a different choice of @xmath42 compared to fig.2a .",
    "in fig.3b we note that while @xmath37 changed dramatically with choice of @xmath42 , this change is compensated by @xmath38 such that @xmath39 remains stable .",
    "the corresponding comparison is not available for the mrrs procedure .",
    "if the threshold behavior evident in fig.2b persists for other choices of scale , the position of the sudden rise in cross - section will move with the choice of scale ; that would be cause for concern .",
    ", the charm quark evolution turns on at @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a arbitrary parameter . ]",
    "in conclusion , we find that the presence or absence of heavy quark mass in the evolution kernels has no physical effect on cross sections  there is no physically new information gained from a mass - dependent evolution .",
    "a mass - dependent evolution scheme has inherent difficulties .",
    "the definition of the mass - dependent splitting kernels introduces a kinematic ambiguity since it is impossible to have an on - shell massless particle split into two collinear massive on - shell particles ( e.g. , @xmath45 ) ; this leads to a number of different definitions for the mass - dependent splitting kernels.@xcite since the pdf s in the mass - dependent scheme are not , the hard scattering cross sections @xmath46 must be converted from the   scheme to this scheme . at nlo , this conversion , as well as the pdf evolution , requires two - loop splitting kernels ( @xmath47 ) computed in the mass - dependent scheme ; these results do not yet exist .",
    "the hallmark of any consistently formulated pqcd theory is : _",
    "i ) _ proper matching between @xmath37 and @xmath38 at threshold , and _",
    "ii ) _ insensitivity of the physical @xmath39 to the arbitrary scheme / scale choice .",
    "the properly implemented general mass formalism satisfies these criteria .",
    "the acot scheme ( with mass - independent  evolution ) has the added advantage that the known mass - independent   kernels follow naturally from the renormalization scheme adopted .",

    "<S> in a consistently formulated pqcd framework incorporating non - zero mass heavy quark partons , there is still the freedom to define parton distributions obeying either mass - independent or mass - dependent evolution equations , contrary to statements made in a recent paper by mrrs . with properly matched hard cross - sections , </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate this principle in a concrete order @xmath0 calculation of the dis charm structure function . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the proper matching between parton definitions and subtractions in the hard cross - section near threshold where the calculation is particularly sensitive to mass effects of the heavy quark . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained from the general - mass formalism are quite stable against different choices of scale and exhibit a smooth transition in the threshold region ( using either mass - independent or mass - dependent evolution ) , in contrast to results of another recently proposed scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> recent improved measurements of heavy quark production in both leptoproduction and hadroproduction demand better theoretical understanding of the underlying qcd physics . </S>",
    "<S> one must consider the changing role of the heavy quark ( denoted by @xmath1 ) from threshold to the very high energy limit available in current and future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we address the question of the mass dependence in the evolution of the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) , @xmath2 .    in the acot factorization scheme,@xcite the heavy quark mass ( @xmath3 ) is fully incorporated in the hard cross - section and threshold ( @xmath4 ) matching conditions on @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme has the desirable feature that the evolution of all partons , including the heavy quark , is controlled by the mass - independent   kernels ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath6 satisfy the well established evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> this is a precise consequence of the renormalization scheme in the theory with mass , _ it is not an approximation_. , the massive hard scattering @xmath7 s reduce to precisely the zero - mass  @xmath7 s without any finite renormalization ; in this sense , the acot scheme is uniquely the minimal massive extension of the  scheme.@xcite ]    a general mass formalism can , in principle , be implemented with factorization prescriptions different from that of acot . in a consistently formulated theory , physical predictions from different schemes must remain the same up to higher - order corrections . in a recent paper , </S>",
    "<S> mrrs @xcite proposed a procedure within the general mass approach involving _ mass - dependent splitting functions _ for the evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> they questioned the validity of the acot scheme because of its use of mass - independent evolution . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to clarify this question and determine what schemes are truly viable , since further development of heavy quark theory and phenomenology rely on the availability of dependable calculations . </S>"
