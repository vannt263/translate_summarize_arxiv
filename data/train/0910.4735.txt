    "the era of the massive surveys of galactic stars is now very much underway .",
    "our understanding of the history of the formation and evolution of the stellar populations in the galaxy is presently being revolutionized , based on results from two primary surveys , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* york et al . 2000 ) ) , in particular its dedicated sub - surveys sloan extension for galactic exploration and understanding ( segue-1 and segue-2 ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* yanny et al . 2009 ) ) and the radial velocity experiment ( rave ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zwitter et al . 2008 ) ; wyse , this volume ) . collectively , these two surveys are in the process of providing detailed spectroscopic information for a million or more stars , sampling all of the known stellar populations in the galaxy .",
    "although refinements in the procedures for extracting estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters ( t@xmath1 , log g , [ fe / h ] ) and individual element abundances ( in the case of sdss / segue , [ @xmath2/fe ] and [ c / fe ] ratios ; for rave , many more ) are still underway , the wealth of information already available provides the basis for numerous investigations and follow - up observations .",
    "here we summarize a few of the ongoing projects that are being enabled by the sdss / segue database .",
    "the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp ) processes the wavelength- and flux - calibrated spectra generated by the standard sdss spectroscopic reduction pipeline , obtains equivalent widths and/or line indices for about 80 atomic or molecular absorption lines , and estimates the effective temperature , t@xmath1 , surface gravity , log g , and metallicity , [ fe / h ] , for a stellar spectrum through the application of a number of approaches .",
    "a given method is usually optimal over specific ranges of color and signal - to - noise ( @xmath3 ) ratio .",
    "the sspp employs 8 primary methods for the estimation of t@xmath1 , 10 for the estimation of log g , and 12 for the estimation of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the final estimates of the atmospheric parameters are obtained by robust averages of the methods that are expected to perform well for the color and @xmath3 of the spectrum obtained for each star .",
    "the use of multiple methods allows for empirical determinations of the internal errors for each parameter , based on the range of reported values from each method  typical internal errors for stars in the temperature range that applies to the calibration stars are @xmath4 100 k to @xmath5 125 k , @xmath6 0.25 dex , and @xmath7 } \\sim$ ] 0.20 dex .",
    "the external errors in these determinations are of similar size .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",

    "( 2008b ) ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* allende prieto et al . ( 2008 ) ) for more details .",
    "over the past several years , large - aperture telescopes have been used to obtain high - resolution spectroscopy for over 300 of the brighter ( 14.0 @xmath8 17.0 ) sdss stars ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* allende prieto et al . 2008 ) ; aoki et al . , in preparation ; lai et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the observations reported by aoki et al . and",
    "lai et al . suggest that the current sspp is actually somewhat conservative in the assignment of metallicities for stars of the lowest [ fe / h ] , in the sense that high - resolution estimates of [ fe / h ] are on the order of 0.3 dex lower than those reported by the sspp .",
    "based on the derived atmospheric parameters from the sspp , and distances estimated from photometric parallaxes , figure 1 shows a simple visualization of the sdss / segue database .",
    "the colors are coded to represent metallicity , and clearly indicate the presence of stars from the disk populations close to the galactic plane , and an extended population of stars comprising representatives of the inner- and outer - halo populations .",
    "more sophisticated visualizations , encoding other available observables such as full space motions , are presently being developed .",
    "the great majority of metal - poor stars in the galaxy identified to date have come from two primary sources , the hk survey of beers and colleagues ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* beers et al .",
    "1985 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* beers et al .",
    "1992 ) ) and the hamburg / eso survey of christlieb and colleages ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* christlieb et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "sdss / segue specifically targeted large numbers of low - metallicity candidates based on combinations of sdss filters that approximately isolate them from the vastly more common higher metallicity stars of the disk populations .",
    "this approach , although not as selective as prism - survey techniques , has greatly enlarged the numbers of known metal - poor stars , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that , due to the ongoing calibration of the sspp at lower metallicities , the true numbers of extremely metal - poor stars identified by sdss / segue with [ fe / h ] @xmath9 is certain to increase in the near future .",
    "the apparent lack of newly discovered ultra ( [ fe / h ] @xmath10 ) and hyper ( [ fe / h ] @xmath11 ) metal - poor stars by sdss / segue could also be , at least in part , due to calibration issues . in order to be certain , all stars with metallicities suggested by the sspp to be below [ fe / h ] @xmath12 need to be observed at higher spectral resolution , as the presence of interstellar ca  ii k ( the only metallic feature detectible at such low metallicities from medium - resolution spectra ) can confound the derived abundance as well .",

    "based on an analysis of a large sample of calibration stars from sdss dr-5 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* adelman - mccarthy et al . 2007 ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* carollo et al . ( 2007 ) ) argued for the existence of _ at least _ a two - component halo .",
    "in their view , the galactic halo comprises two broadly overlapping structural components , an inner and an outer halo .",
    "these components exhibit different spatial density profiles , stellar orbits , and stellar metallicities .",
    "it was found that the inner - halo component dominates the population of halo stars found at distances up to 10 - 15 kpc from the galactic center , while the outer - halo component dominates in the region beyond 15 - 20 kpc .",
    "the inner halo was shown to comprise a population of stars exhibiting a flattened spatial density distribution , with an inferred axial ratio on the order of 0.6 . according to these authors , inner - halo stars possess generally high orbital eccentricities , and exhibit a small ( or zero ) net prograde rotation around the center of the galaxy . the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of the inner halo peaks at [ fe / h ] = @xmath181.6 , with tails exending to higher and lower metallicities . by comparison ,",
    "the outer halo comprises stars that exhibit a more spherical spatial density distribution with an axial ratio @xmath5 0.9 .",
    "outer - halo stars possess a wide range of eccentricities , exhibit a clear retrograde net rotation , and are drawn from an mdf that peaks at [ fe / h ] = @xmath182.2 , a factor of four lower than that of the inner - halo population .",
    "this work has now been extended by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* carollo et al . ( 2009 ) ) ( see also carollo s article , this volume ) , making use of the calibration star sample through dr-7 .",
    "the full sample of 32360 stars represents an increase of 60% relative to the numbers used in the previous analysis .",
    "the larger sample , which includes many more stars from the disk populations due to segue observations , has been used to derive , among many other results , estimates of the velocity ellipsoids for the inner- and outer - halo populations , as well as for the metal - weak thick disk ( mwtd ) and canonical thick - disk populations .",
    "one can obtain an impression of the contribution of the various populations to the observed mdf from inspection of figure 2 , which shows its variation with height above the galactic plane .",
    "examination of the left - hand column of panels in this figure shows how the mdf changes from the upper panel , in which there are obvious contributions from the thick - disk , mwtd , and inner - halo components in the cuts close to plane , to the lower panel , with an mdf dominated by inner - halo stars . in the right - hand column of panels , with distances from the plane greater than 5 kpc ,",
    "the transition from inner - halo dominance to a much greater contribution from outer - halo stars is obvious .",
    "this demonstration is , by design , independent of any errors that might arise from derivation of the kinematic parameters , and provides confirmation of the difference in the chemical properties of the inner- and outer - halo populations originally suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* carollo et al . ( 2007 ) ) .",
    "although it might appear possible to attempt mixture - model analysis to obtain mdfs for each of the individual components , we recall that biases in the selection of the stars in the calibration - star sample would confound such an attempt .",
    "other samples of sdss stars are being studied for this purpose , and will be reported on in due course .",
    "* schlaufman et al . ( 2009 ) ) have used the segue spectroscopic database of metal - poor main - sequence turnoff ( mpmsto ) stars to search for significant radial velocity enhancements along 137 segue-1 lines of sight .",
    "they identify ten ( seven for the first time ) elements of cold halo substructure ( echos ) in the volume within 17.5 kpc of the sun , in the inner halo of the milky way .",
    "these echos represent the observable stellar debris of ancient merger events in the stellar accretion history of the milky way .",
    "these authors use their detections and completeness estimates to infer a formal upper limit of @xmath19 on the fraction of the mpmsto population in the inner halo that belong to echos .",
    "they also suggest that there exists a significant population of low fractional overdensity echos in the inner halo , and predict that one - third of the inner halo ( by volume ) harbors echos with mpmsto number densities @xmath20 kpc@xmath21 .",
    "in addition , they estimate that there are @xmath22 10@xmath23 echos in the entire inner halo . since echos are likely older than the known substructures identified by surface - brightness contrast methods , these detections provide a direct measure of the accretion history of the milky way in a region and time interval that has yet to be fully explored .",
    "the authors argue , on the basis of this information , that the level of merger activity has been roughly constant over the past few gyrs , and that there has been no accretion of stellar systems more massive than a few percent of the milky way mass in that interval .",
    "lee et al . ( in preparation ) demonstrate , by comparison with measured abundances of [ @xmath2/fe ] from high - resolution spectra in the elodie spectral library and recently obtained @xmath24 spectra from hobby - eberly telescope observations of sdss / segue stars , that it is possible to determine [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios from sdss spectra ( with @xmath25 ) to an accuracy of better than 0.1 dex , for stars with atmospheric parameters in the range t@xmath1 = [ 4500,7500 ] k , log g = [ 1.5,5.0 ] , and [ fe / h ] = [ @xmath182.5,@xmath260.2 ] .",
    "this capability opens up the opportunity to make use of this ratio to investigate predictions from simulation studies of the formation and evolution of the disk systems of the milky way ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "* johnston et al . 2008 ) )",
    ".    for example , the lower right panel of figure 3 shows , for a sample of some 10000 sdss / segue f- and g - dwarfs in the solar neighboorhood , that stars with higher [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios ( associated with the thick disk ) have orbital eccentricities that peak around 0.2 , with relatively few such stars having higher eccentricities ( most of these are found at lower [ fe / h ] , indicating possible membership in the mwtd population ) .",
    "the association of the low - metallicity , high-[@xmath2/fe ] stars with the mwtd population is also indicated by the lower left panel of figure 3 , where it is clear that they exhibit a substantially lower mean rotational velocity .",
    "much remains to be explored with data such as these .",
    "stars with observed carbon enhancements are likely to play a key role in our understanding of the formation and evolution of the various stellar populations in the galaxy , as the production mechanisms of carbon depend sensitively on the initial mass function and star formation environments of their birth .",
    "although carbon - enhanced stars were not specifically selected for in sdss / segue , they are found in great numbers over a variety of the categories that were targeted , such as metal - poor stars , f - turnoff stars , and late - type giants .     in metal - poor stars .",
    "the upper panels show a portion of the original spectrum ( black ) overlayed with a synthetic spectrum ( red ) with the listed parameters and [ c / fe ] = 0 .",

    "for spectra with sufficient s / n ( roughly @xmath27 ) these methods are now able to estimate [ c / fe ] , or upper limits on [ c / fe ] , accurate to roughly 0.1 dex . see figure 4 for some examples of fits to the ch g - band region , which is the feature used to estimate [ c / fe ] .",
    "there are several hundred thousand stars in sdss / segue for which such estimates now exist . based on these data , sivarani et al .",
