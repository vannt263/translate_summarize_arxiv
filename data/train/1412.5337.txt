    "the stationary dirac equation leads to a singularity in the solution for the ground state of an electron in the field of the pointlike nucleus with the charge @xmath0137 .",
    "but for an extended nucleus the energy of the 1@xmath1  state @xmath2 goes continuously beyond the point @xmath3 and reaches the negative - energy continuum at the critical value @xmath4  @xcite . as predicted independently by gershtein and zeldovich  @xcite and by pieper and greiner  @xcite ,",
    "if the empty level dives into the negative - energy continuum , then it turns into a resonance that can lead to the spontaneous decay of the vacuum via emission of a positron and occupation of the supercritical k - shell by an electron .",
    "the experimental observation of this effect would confirm the predictions of quantum electrodynamics in the highly nonperturbative supercritical domain .",
    "unfortunately , the charge of the heaviest produced nuclei is far less than the required one , @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the collision of two ions , if their total charge is sufficiently large , the ground state of the formed quasimolecular system can become so deeply bound that the spontaneous pair creation is possible .",
    "the most favorable collision energy for investigation of the supercritical regime is about the coulomb barrier  @xcite . in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the electron - positron pairs can also be created dynamically due to the time - dependent potential of the moving ions . in order to find the signal from the vacuum decay one needs to distinguish the spontaneously produced pairs from the dynamical background .",
    "the experiments for searching the spontaneous pair creation were performed at gsi ( darmstadt , germany ) using the collisions of partially stripped ions with neutral atoms , but no evidence of the vacuum decay was found  @xcite . it should be noticed that for studying this phenomenon the collisions of bare nuclei would be more favorable due to the empty k - shell .",
    "it is expected that the upcoming facility for antiproton and ion research  ( fair ) will provide new opportunities for investigations of low - energy heavy - ion collisions , probably including the collisions of fully stripped ions  @xcite .",
    "to date a number of approaches to calculations of various processes in low - energy heavy - ion collisions have been proposed  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the pair - creation process was considered in the static approximation , according to which the corresponding probability is proportional to the resonance width @xmath6 which depends on the internuclear distance @xmath7 .",
    "such an approximation does not take into account the dynamical effects .",
    "a more advanced approach was based on the propagation of a finite number of initial states using the time - dependent adiabatic basis set with the feshbach projection technique  ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this method allowed calculations of the pair - creation probabilities employing small numbers of the basis functions .",
    "however , the small basis size might lead to the low resolution of the continuum . from the results , which were basically obtained in the monopole approximation ,",
    "it was concluded that the spontaneous contribution is indistinguishable from the dynamical background in the positron spectra in elastic collisions , and only in hypothetical collisions with the nuclear sticking can there be the visible effects of the vacuum decay  @xcite .",
    "another dynamical approach  @xcite was based on solving the time - dependent dirac equation in the monopole approximation with the mapped fourier grid method . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pair - creation probabilities were calculated with propagation of all initial states of a very large basis set , compared to the previous works , that might improve the energy resolution of the continuum . for the collisions of bare uranium nuclei ,",
    "the results for the positron spectra were quite different from those in ref .",
    "the importance of the dynamical pair - production effects follows also from the recent perturbative evaluation of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop an alternative method for calculations of the pair - creation probabilities in low - energy heavy - ion collisions . in this method ,",
    "the time - dependent dirac equation is solved numerically in the monopole approximation employing the stationary basis set .",
    "the basis functions are constructed from the b - splines using the dual - kinetic - balance ( dkb ) approach  @xcite , which prevents the appearance of nonphysical spurious states .",
    "the dkb b - spline basis set provides a very accurate representation of the continuum and previously was successfully used in qed calculations for the summation over the whole dirac spectrum ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "all of the eigenvectors of the initial hamiltonian matrix are propagated in order to obtain the one - electron transition amplitudes , which are used to calculate the particle - production probabilities .",

    "<S> a method for calculations of electron - positron pair - creation probabilities in low - energy heavy - ion collisions is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is based on the propagation of all one - electron states via the numerical solving of the time - dependent dirac equation in the monopole approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the electron wave functions are represented as finite sums of basis functions constructed from b - splines using the dual - kinetic - balance technique . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations of the created particle numbers and the positron energy spectra are performed for the collisions of bare nuclei at the energies near the coulomb barrier with the rutherford trajectory and for different values of the nuclear charge and the impact parameter . to examine the role of the spontaneous pair creation the collisions with a modified velocity and with a time delay </S>",
    "<S> are also considered . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results are compared with the previous calculations and the possibility of observation of the spontaneous pair creation is discussed . </S>"
