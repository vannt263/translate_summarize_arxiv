    "such distributions include in particular the uniform distribution where all input strings are chosen with equal weight @xmath121 .",
    "to start we derive the upper bound @xmath66 , valid for any distribution @xmath119 . from the definition  ( [ cstrat ] ) , we have that @xmath122 for every input string @xmath123 .",
    "this trivially leads to the upper - bound @xmath124 notice that this bound is only meaningful when the right - hand side is smaller than 1 , since obviously @xmath125 .",
    "we now show that for all no - signalling distributions @xmath126 , from which the bound @xmath66 immediately follows .",
    "first note that from the no - signaling condition , [ rec ] p(a_1,  ,a_k-1|x_1,  ,x_k-1)p(a_1,  ,a_k|x_1,  ,x_k ) .",
    "we now write @xmath127 where the inequality follows from and in the last equality we used the no - signaling condition after summing over @xmath128 . iteratively performing this last step ,",
    "we finally obtain _ x p(a_i = x_i+1|x)_x_1,x_2 p(a_1=x_2|x_1)2 .",
    "we now analyze the no - signalling winning probability for distributions satisfying @xmath120 for some input string @xmath23 .",
    "note that for such weights @xmath129 , as easily follows from ( [ cstrat ] ) . we thus have _",
    "ns=_xq(x ) p(a_i = x_i+1|x)_xp(a_i = x_i+1|x ) .",
    "but , as we have shown above , @xmath126 for all no - signalling distributions , and thus @xmath130 .",
    "since any classical strategy is also a no - signalling strategy , it actually holds that @xmath68 .",
    "here we describe two inequivalent no - signaling correlations which attain @xmath131 for the tripartite inequality .",
    "these correlations are extremal non - local boxes in the sense of being vertices of the no - signaling polytope for three parties and binary inputs and outputs  @xcite .    writing @xmath132 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 for @xmath135 , we can write the first box as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the boolean function @xmath138 similarly , we can write the second box as @xmath139 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 the two boolean functions @xmath140 among the boxes that are equivalent to @xmath141 under relabeling of parties , inputs , and outputs , a total of 24 of them violate maximally the bell inequality , and similarly for 8 of those that are equivalent to @xmath142 .",
    "even though other tripartite no - signaling boxes ( inequivalent to @xmath141 or @xmath142 under relabeling of parties , inputs , or outputs ) violate the bell inequality , those 32 boxes obtained from @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the unique ones that violate it maximally .",
    "here we show that for the input distribution , the no - signaling bound for an even number of parties @xmath108 is always equal to the no - signaling bound for @xmath0 parties . start by considering @xmath108-gyni game , where the first @xmath0 players use the optimal strategy for the @xmath0-player case and player @xmath108 outputs its input .",
    "they then achieve a no - signaling violation equal to the @xmath0 case , which imposes the lower bound @xmath143 .",
    "but this is actually the best average success these @xmath108 players can obtain . to see that , consider the game for @xmath108 parties .",
    "allowing players @xmath0 and @xmath108 to communicate can only increase the achievable value of @xmath144 .",
    "indeed , in this situation the best strategy that player @xmath0 can adopt is to output @xmath145 , which was communicated to him by player @xmath108 , while player @xmath108 needs to guess @xmath146 given @xmath128 and @xmath145 .",
    "clearly , the knowledge of @xmath145 is of no use for him since this bit is completely uncorrelated with the rest of the input string .",
    "consequently , the situation is analogous to having players @xmath147 ( i.e. all players except player @xmath0 ) play the game for @xmath0 parties .",
    "therefore @xmath148 and we have finally that @xmath149 for odd @xmath0 .",
    "in what follows , we derive a criterion that is necessarily satisfied by any facet - defining bell inequality associated to the task of nonlocal computation ( nlc ) @xcite , and show that none of the nlc bell inequalities for boolean functions of two and three input bits are facet - defining .",
    "nonlocal computation is a distributed task of two parties , where the goal is to compute a given boolean function @xmath150 of an @xmath65-bit string @xmath151 .",
    "the input bit string is decomposed into two strings @xmath152 and @xmath153 , such that @xmath154 .",
    "the bit string @xmath152 is sent to party a while the bit string @xmath153 is sent to party b. upon receiving their input bit strings , a and b each output a single bit , @xmath155 and @xmath156 respectively , such that the following relation holds : @xmath157 .",
    "importantly , each party has locally no information about the input bit string @xmath151 , that is @xmath158 for all @xmath159 . for each @xmath65 , @xmath150 , and distribution of inputs",
    "@xmath160 , we obtain a bell expression whose value is associated to the probability of success at the task .",
    "these nlc inequalities have the form @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are observables which take values @xmath164 .",
    "notice that each party measures @xmath165 observables .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it is proven that the best classical strategy is given by @xmath166 and @xmath167 with @xmath168 where @xmath169 denotes a single bit and @xmath170 an @xmath65-bit string shared by the parties .",
    "this classical strategy , which is a linear approximation of the function @xmath171 , achieves a winning probability as high as any quantum resource .",
    "thus the local and quantum bounds of inequalities coincide .",
    "there exist however no - signaling correlations which can perform with winning probability one at this game .",
    "checking whether the nlc inequalities are facet - defining is in general a hard problem since one should consider any input size @xmath65 , boolean function @xmath171 , and distribution @xmath172 .",
    "below we give a first simplification to this problem by deriving a necessary criterion satisfied by facet nlc inequalities .",
    "our method is based on a mapping from the @xmath173 correlation space ",
    "i.e. ( 2 parties , @xmath165 settings , 2 outcomes )  in which the nlc inequalities are defined , into the @xmath174 full - correlation space for which the complete set of tight bell inequalities has been provided in ref .  .",
    "to any inequality of the form ( [ lpsw ] ) defined by the triple @xmath175 , we associate the following bell inequality in the @xmath174 full - correlation space : @xmath176 where @xmath177 , and where we view @xmath178 as denoting one of two possible observables @xmath179 of party  @xmath18 taking values @xmath164 ( with @xmath180 ) .",
    "_ proof . _",
    "the deterministic extremal points of the @xmath174 full - correlation polytope are of the form   [ det ] c_z_1  c_z_n=(-1)^u_1z_1  (-1)^u_n z_n(-1)^=(-1)^*uz * where @xmath183 specifies the local strategy of each party and @xmath184 represents an additional global sign flip , which we can think of as being carried out by the last party .",
    "these deterministic points are thus specified by the single bit @xmath169 and the @xmath65-bit string @xmath170 , and are therefore in one - to - one correspondence with the extremal points ( [ opt strat ] ) saturating the inequalities ( [ lpsw ] ) . for any such strategy specified by @xmath169 and @xmath185 ,",
    "we have that        let us now suppose that the bell inequality @xmath186 is not facet - defining . then we can write @xmath187 and @xmath188 for some @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 such that i^1_n22(n , f , p)2 ^ -nk^1(n , f , p ) and i^2_n22(n , f , p)2 ^ -n k^2(n , f , p ) are valid inequalities for the @xmath174 full - correlation polytope , i.e. , they are satisfied by all deterministic points of the form ( [ det ] ) .",
    "but then it follows from the above correspondence between deterministic point of the @xmath174 polytope and the @xmath173 polytope that @xmath193 , where i^1(n , f , p)k^1(n , f , p ) and i^2(n , f , p)k^2(n , f , p ) are valid nlc inequalities .",
    "this implies that @xmath194 is not facet - defining for the @xmath173 polytope , from which the statement of the lemma follows .",
    "@xmath195    the above lemma implies that it is sufficient to restrict our analysis on nlc inequalities associated with facet inequalities in the @xmath174-full correlation space . in ref .",
    "a construction for the coefficients @xmath196 of all facet @xmath174 correlation bell inequalities has been given .",
    "for small number of inputs , i.e. @xmath117 , we have explicitly verified that none of the corresponding nlc inequalities are facet - defining ; all these inequalities can actually be expressed as sums of chsh inequalities . for larger @xmath65",
    "however , a similar analysis becomes difficult due to the large number of facet @xmath174 bell inequalities and the high dimensionality of the @xmath173 correlation space ."

    "<S> in @xcite , gill raised the question of whether there exist bell inequalities which ( i ) feature this ` no quantum advantage ' property and ( ii ) define facets of the polytope of local correlations . here </S>",
    "<S> we give a positive answer to this question . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the gyni inequalities defined by the distribution are facet - defining for @xmath110 players . </S>",

    "<S> first , it would be interesting to understand the structure of those input distributions @xmath12 leading to a gap between no - signaling and classical / quantum correlations ( see appendix a , for a class of distributions for which there is no gap ) . </S>",

    "<S> another question is thus to single out , among all relevant input distributions , those corresponding to facet bell inequalities . for three parties </S>",
    "<S> , it follows from @xcite that the distribution is the unique possibility .    </S>",
    "<S> a further interesting problem is whether there exist facet bell inequalities with no quantum advantage in the bipartite case . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , examples of bipartite bell inequalities with no quantum advantage have been presented in the context of nonlocal computation . </S>",
    "<S> however , as mentioned earlier , none of the bell inequalities associated to nonlocal computation has been proven to be facet - defining . </S>",
    "<S> we studied this question here and could prove that none of the simplest inequalities from @xcite ( corresponding to the family of inequalities specified by the parameters @xmath117 in @xcite ) are facet inequalities . </S>",
