    "single - electron tunneling ( for general reviews , see refs . )",
    "is one of the most active areas of solid state physics research , but it has several key problems that have not yet been addressed in detail .",
    "one of these problems is the dilemma of the discreteness / continuity of electric charge transfer@xcite .",
    "several single - electron tunneling phenomena can be understood as an interplay between _ discrete _ transfer of electric charge via electron tunneling , and _ continuous _ transfer in ordinary diffusive conductors .",
    "for example , a tunnel junction biased by a dc current may generate single - electron tunneling ( set ) oscillations with average frequency @xcite    @xmath10    this effect may be interpreted as a gradual accumulation of continuous charge on the junction capacitance , followed by the abrupt passage of one electron through the junction , as soon as the accumulated charge has reached a threshold level@xcite @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "however , if the charge transfer in the external circuit ( fixing the current @xmath13 ) is discrete , set oscillations do not exist .",
    "this can be seen from the following general formula for the set oscillation linewidth @xcite : @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the spectral density of the bias current fluctuations .",
    "for example , if the current is fixed using another tunnel junction , then at low temperatures the fluctuations obey the schottky formula @xmath16    and @xmath17 , that is , set oscillations are completely smeared by the current fluctuations@xcite . on the other hand , in macroscopic diffusive conductors ,",
    "the current noise may be much lower than the schottky value , and set oscillations ( and very similar `` bloch '' oscillations@xcite ) may have a relatively narrow bandwidth - see , e.g. , experimental measurements in ref . .",
    "more generally , discreteness of charge transfer will certainly be one of the central issues facing the emerging nanoelectronics .",
    "this is why it is important to formulate the conditions under which the transport of charge through a conductor may be considered as ( quasi)continuous , i.e. , having discreteness @xmath18",
    ". the definition of @xmath19 can be most readily introduced in the most interesting case of negligible thermal and quantum fluctuations : @xmath20 \\ , ,   \\label{lowt } \\\\ g & \\ll & \\frac{e^{2}}{h}\\ , ,   \\label{lowg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the coulomb blockade threshold of the conductor and @xmath22 its effective conductance . however , even in this simplest case , the definition depends essentially on the characteristic time scale @xmath23 of an experiment :    a. if @xmath24 ( i.e. either the time scale @xmath23 is large , or the dc current is high , or both ) , @xmath19 may be defined as follows : @xmath25 in fact , if the charge @xmath26 transferred through a system may be presented as a poissonian series of jumps of fixed height @xmath19 , then repeating the well - known derivation of the schottky formula we arrive at eqn .",
    "( [ deltaq ] ) . if the jump height is random as well , eqn .",
    "( [ deltaq ] ) is still applicable as an estimate of the average jump height .",
    "b. in the opposite limit , when @xmath23 is much shorter than the average spacing between the charge jumps ( @xmath27 ) , we are essentially dealing with the coulomb blockade regime . in this case",
    "an adequate definition of @xmath28 is as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the effective input capacitance of the system of interest .",
    "( @xmath19 given by this formula is the fraction of the initial electric charge of the system which can not relax , due to the coulomb blockade ; for a diffusive conductor @xmath31 , while for a single tunnel junction @xmath32 . )",
    "one of the most interesting systems capable of quasicontinuous charge transfer is the 1d array of small tunnel junctions  see , e.g. , the review in ref . .",
    "the key property of such an array@xcite is that each additional electron inserted into one of its islands creates a series of gradually decreasing polarization charges , and hence may be considered as a `` single - electron soliton '' with a characteristic size @xmath33 which may be much larger than one island . as a result , when an electron is drifting along the array , tunneling between the neighboring islands , the effective charge @xmath26 transferred through the external electrodes  which is essentially what interests us  changes in jumps of scale @xmath34 which may be much smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the condition @xmath36 is sufficient for the quasicontinuous transfer of charge in the arrays .",
    "in fact , the calculation of the coulomb blockade threshold for arrays with uniform@xcite and random@xcite background charges have shown that , under definition b , charge transport in uniform arrays with vanishing background charge _",
    "can not _ be considered as continuous ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the reason is that a relatively strong coulomb blockage results from the pinning of single - electron solitons by the sharp edges of the array . presently , we know only two cases when charge transport through a uniform array is quasicontinuous ( @xmath18 ) according to the definition b :    \\1 ) an array with arbitrary capacitances , but with the background charge of all the islands equal to @xmath38 . ( in this case the coulomb blockade threshold vanishes , and @xmath39 . )",
    "\\2 ) an array with @xmath40 and random background charges .",
    "( in this case@xcite @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the tunnel junction capacitance , while @xmath43 , and hence @xmath44 . )",
    "however , even in these cases , the charge transfer is not automatically continuous in the sense of criterion a. if the coulomb blockade is finite , and the array is driven with dc voltage @xmath45 slightly above the blockade threshold @xmath21 , one of the junctions presents a bottleneck to the single - electron soliton drift along the array . as a result ,",
    "the passage of an electron consists of a long wait at the bottleneck junction , followed by a rapid burst of transitions through the remaining junctions of the array . at @xmath46",
    "the statistics of these bursts is always poissonian , and the charge transferred by each burst is equal to @xmath35 , so that the shot noise is well described by the schottky formula .    thus , current noise in 1d arrays presents an important problem . to our knowledge",
    ", this problem has previously only been solved@xcite for a very particular case of uniform arrays with @xmath47 ( zero stray capacitance ) and zero background charge .",
    "the objective of this work was to calculate @xmath48 ( and hence the effective discreteness of charge transfer for long time intervals ) for a much broader range of array parameters .",
    "we have considered arrays consisting of @xmath49 small metallic islands connected by @xmath3 tunnel junctions , and flanked at either end by dc voltage - biased electrodes ( fig .",
    "[ array - diag ] ) . under the conditions expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ lowt ] ) , ( [ lowg ] ) , we can ignore the effects of cotunneling and of thermally activated tunneling .",
    "current flow in single - electron arrays may be analyzed in terms of the junction tunneling rates , @xmath50 . according to the orthodox theory@xcite , at zero temperature ,    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the drop in the free ( electrostatic ) energy , caused by the tunneling event .",
    "the drop in energy due to an electron tunneling from island @xmath53 to island @xmath54 can be written    @xmath55\\ , ,   \\label{deltau}\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 is the vector of the electrostatic potential of the islands before the jump , and the matrix @xmath57of inverse capacitances is defined by the following equation :    @xmath58    here the matrix @xmath59 represents capacitances between islands and external terminals with potentials @xmath60 if these potentials do not change in time , the probability that the system preserves its charge state can be expressed explicitly :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the time of the preceding tunneling event , while @xmath63 is the total rate for all possible tunneling events :    @xmath64",
    "the preceding relations were incorporated into our main computational tool , a c++ program called mso@xcite that uses a monte carlo algorithm@xcite to simulate the flow of current in dc voltage biased 1d arrays .",
    "the basic unit of calculation in mso is the `` current run '' , in which charge flows through the array until a user - specified total charge @xmath26 is transferred . to calculate @xmath0 , mso loops through a user - specified number @xmath65 of current runs , each starting with the same initial charge state and ending when the total charge transferred equals @xmath26 .",
    "the same random number generators@xcite for time and jump location are used continuously through all loops .",
    "to the extent that the random numbers constitute a `` good '' quasi - random series , the ensemble of current runs represents a statistical ensemble of independent , initially identical systems .",
    "we may calculate @xmath0 from the statistical properties of the time @xmath66 taken by each run , as@xcite :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 , and the angle brackets and variance refer to our statistical ensemble of current runs . equation ( [ s - vart ] ) is exact only for infinite @xmath26 and @xmath65 ; since the jumps are not completely independent , the accuracy of this formula should be determined experimentally . figure  [ s - qn ] shows a typical dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath26 and @xmath65 .",
    "the results for @xmath70 , @xmath71 seem to be accurate to within @xmath72 of the asymptotic value . in this paper",
    ", we used the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 for calculating shot noise in arrays without background charge , and assigned @xmath72 error bars to these numbers .    for arrays with random background charge ,",
    "each point was calculated for 50 different realizations of the background charge for each circuit , using the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 , to keep the simulation time within reasonable limits .",
    "although these calculations are therefore less accurate , perhaps only to within @xmath77 of their asymptotic value , this inaccuracy was overshadowed by the overall spread in shot noise values among the different background charge realizations .",
    "calculation ( cpu ) times in mso scale as @xmath78 , with @xmath79 slightly larger than 2 .",
    "a typical calculation with @xmath80 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 takes around 400 seconds of cpu time on an alphastation 250 ( 266 mhz alpha , digital unix 4.0b , digital cxx ) or around 950 seconds on a linux pc ( 120 mhz pentium , redhat linux 2.0.30 , ) .",
    "varying the bias voltage across an array , we have calculated the average current and spectral density as functions of applied voltage and have made parametric plots of @xmath81 vs. @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ s - i ] ) .",
    "we will refer to these plots as @xmath83 curves .",
    "the most immediate , universal result of our calculations is the crossover of @xmath84 from @xmath85 to @xmath86 with increasing current .",
    "this result can be understood as follows . as argued in section [ introduction ] ,",
    "@xmath0 near threshold is dominated by the poissonian statistics of tunneling through a single bottleneck junction , and is thus given by the schottky formula : @xmath87    at high voltages , however , a large number of charge states becomes available for tunneling through each junction .",
    "though the tunneling rate for each of these states may be affected by the state of neighboring junctions , these effects are averaged out , since the voltage dependence of the rate of tunneling through each junction is linear at @xmath88 ( see eqn .",
    "( [ gamma - zero ] ) ) . under these conditions ,",
    "current noise through each junction is described by the schottky formula , @xmath89 . since we may transform current noise into voltage noise by the square of the dynamic resistance ( which at @xmath90 just equals @xmath91 )",
    ", we write the voltage noise of a single junction as @xmath92    the total voltage noise @xmath93 is the simple sum of the noise of the individual junctions @xmath94 , while the total current noise is finally obtained from @xmath93 via the total array resistance @xmath95 : @xmath96 ( for the particular case @xmath97 this equation has been discussed in ref . . )",
    "thus the crossover in @xmath81 from @xmath85 to @xmath86 with increasing current could be expected ; what was really surprising for us is that in most cases this crossover takes place very close to the coulomb blockade threshold , where the array @xmath98 curve is still not quite linear , and hence the arguments given above can not be taken too seriously .    in order to describe the crossover quantitatively , we may define the _ crossover current _ @xmath4 as a value at which @xmath99 is midway between these two limits , on a logarithmic scale : @xmath100 we have written a perl script called sicurve to automate the extraction of the crossover current @xmath4 from the @xmath83 curves . while invoking mso , sicurve continuously adjusts the change in bias voltage between successive points , in an attempt to produce a series of evenly spaced points in the @xmath101 vs. @xmath102 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ s - i ] ) .",
    "this is an important practical technique for generating @xmath83 curves on circuits with random background charge , since the relationship between voltage , current , and spectral density can be quite irregular .",
    "our first case was the simplest model@xcite of a uniform , symmetrically biased array near a ground plane with no background charges ( fig .",
    "the direct capacitance matrix in this model is tridiagonal , and is described by one dimensionless parameter , the ratio @xmath103 where @xmath42 is the junction capacitance , and @xmath104 is the `` stray '' capacitance between an island and the ground plane . in this model ,",
    "the reciprocal length scale @xmath105 of the single - electron soliton is determined as @xmath106 and in the most interesting limit of @xmath107 , @xmath108 .    surprisingly , our numerical results ( fig .",
    "[ tri - ic - nl ] ) show that for all values of @xmath7 and @xmath109 data for @xmath4 fall roughly on a single universal curve , with for . for a fixed product @xmath110 ,",
    "there is a relatively weak decrease of @xmath4 with increasing @xmath3 .    to understand this unexpected result",
    ", we began looking for an analytic expression for current noise for the case when the passage of charge through the array consists of a fixed , repeated sequence of tunneling events .",
    "if such a sequence is repeated @xmath111 times , we can write the average total time as a sum of average times for each jump in the fixed sequence : @xmath112    where @xmath113 is the total rate at each stage of the process .",
    "since the time of each jump follows poissonian statistics , @xmath114    and since the jump times are independent of one another , @xmath115    we arrive at a simple formula@xcite : @xmath116    this formula was obtained earlier@xcite for a particular case @xmath117 . in particular",
    ", it shows that the spectral density can be dominated by bottleneck points , where the rate @xmath118 is much lower than average .    in order to find these bottleneck points for the present case of arrays near a ground plane , let us examine the energy profile created by these arrays for tunneling charges .",
    "the potential created by an electron in an array with externals at both ends is@xcite @xmath119+e^{-(n - n)\\lambda } \\sinh ( n\\lambda ) } { \\sinh ( n\\lambda ) } \\right\\ } \\ , ,   \\label{tri - phi - s}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the position of the electron in the array , @xmath121 is the measurement position , and @xmath122 . for our symmetric bias ( @xmath123 ) , the potential created by the external electrodes is@xcite @xmath124}{\\sinh ( n\\lambda /2)}% \\ , .",
    "\\label{tri - v}\\ ] ]    numerical simulations show that in symmetrically biased arrays with , the basic tunneling scenario near threshold is the passage of electron - hole pairs .",
    "the components of the pair enter at opposite ends of the array , move towards each other , then annihilate near the center ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we can write the energy of the electron - hole pair as @xmath125    where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the positions of the electron and hole , respectively , and @xmath128-e^{-n\\lambda } } { \\sinh ( n\\lambda ) } \\right]\\ ] ] is the self - energy of an electron or hole .",
    "figure [ tri - ic - nl ] shows the results of calculation of the crossover current using eqs .",
    "( [ ehp - energy ] ) and ( [ sian ] ) in a fixed scenario picture , where the electron and hole enter the array one right after the other , and then take turns tunneling towards each other in a symmetric manner . for , the results of this semi - analytical calculation match the monte carlo results very closely .",
    "( for @xmath129 , a difference appears , increasing with @xmath3 . )",
    "this means that we can analyze our problem , at least approximately , by examining the energy profile in our fixed scenario .",
    "a straightforward analysis of eq . ( [ ehp - energy ] ) shows that , for , there is a slow point ( a minimum in @xmath52 ) when both electron and hole are islands from their respective edge of the array .",
    "here both members of the electron - hole pair are far from the edges and can not be pushed strongly by the external voltage , yet are not close enough to attract each other strongly , either . at this point , @xmath113 scales as @xmath130 . according to eq .",
    "( [ sian ] ) , this leads to a similar dependence of @xmath4 , at least in the limit .",
    "some difference between the fixed - scenario calculations and the monte carlo simulations can be readily explained by the observation that frequently the tunneling process is somewhat more complicated than the exactly alternating electron and hole motion sequence ",
    "see table 1 .",
    "figure  [ tri - gt ] shows a typical pattern of the total tunneling rates .",
    "these figures show that sometimes there are three ( rather then one ) slow points with low @xmath113 .",
    "the first slow point is before any charge enters the array ( see labels ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ tri - gt ] ) .",
    "after the first charge enters the array , the external voltage pushes it quickly away from the edge .",
    "there is then typically a second slow point when that charge reaches a distance of roughly @xmath131 islands from the external it emerged from ( see labels ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ tri - gt ] ) .",
    "then the opposite charge enters the array from the other side , also hopping quickly away from the edge .",
    "the third slow point usually follows when the opposite charge is roughly @xmath131 islands away from its external ( see labels ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ tri - gt ] ) .",
    "only the first two points are taken into account in our fixed scenario .",
    "since the second slow point is frequently important , the good agreement between our monte carlo and fixed scenario calculations is somewhat puzzling .",
    "here we examine the case of an array with islands between semi - infinite external electrodes ( fig .",
    "[ cube - diag]a ) , without a ground plane . in the absence of a ground plane , mutual capacitances",
    "other than the junction capacitances may become important .    to model the electrostatics of such arrays ,",
    "we have used two methods . in the first method",
    ", we create a geometric model of the island and external electrodes ( fig .",
    "[ cube - diag]b ) , and use it to calculate the full capacitance matrix for the array numerically using fastcap@xcite . since the electrostatics is rather insensitive to the exact shape of the islands@xcite , they may be modeled by cubes of side length @xmath79 . the resulting capacitance matrix ( an example is given in table  [ cube - mat ] ) was used for the monte carlo simulation of noise , as described above .",
    "in the second method , we used a simple heuristic approximation for the single - electron soliton potential at distance @xmath132 in a long array , found in ref . , @xmath133 \\right\\ } \\",

    "this formula describes a crossover from an exponential decay at short distance ( @xmath135 to a coulomb - law @xmath136 decay at large distance .",
    "the effect of the external electrodes was described by the usual image charge method ; in our case , with two electrodes , it involves an infinite series of images . as a result",
    ", the full single electron potential , @xmath137 , may be expressed as the sum of an infinite series over all image charge contributions , and the self energy can be written as @xmath138}{2}\\right\\ } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the form of the external potential is quite simple , @xmath139 the energy for an electron - hole pair can then be written just as in eqn .",
    "( [ ehp - energy ] ) .",
    "this energy was used for the fixed - scenario calculation of noise , similar to that described in the previous section .",
    "results from both methods are shown in fig .",
    "[ cube - ic - l ] .",
    "the monte carlo simulation shows that , unlike in arrays near a ground plane , @xmath4 does not follow a universal dependence on @xmath110 .",
    "rather , the @xmath4 values follow a common curve depending mostly on @xmath7 alone , decreasing weakly with the array length @xmath3 . even the @xmath7 dependence is weak , compared to the results for arrays near ground plane : for @xmath80 in the range of @xmath7 from 0.25 to 1",
    ", @xmath4 drops by a factor of @xmath140 in arrays with no ground plane , whereas it drops by more than two decades in arrays with ground plane ( fig .",
    "[ tri - ic - nl ] ) .    the fixed scenario results for @xmath4 match the monte carlo results fairly well in terms of the shape of the @xmath7 dependence of the curves .",
    "for @xmath141 , the magnitude of the results are also in fairly close agreement . however , the fixed scenario results exhibit a stronger decline with @xmath3 than the monte carlo results . for @xmath142 ,",
    "the fixed scenario values of @xmath4 are between 3 and 8 times smaller than the corresponding monte carlo values .",
    "generally , it is easy to understand why the fixed scenario values for @xmath4 fall below the values calculated with monte carlo simulation : randomness of jump location , which is ignored in the fixed scenario calculation , can be thought of as an additional source of noise . as the general level of noise in the crossover region increases , so does the crossover current .",
    "however , we are still in need of a simple interpretation of the @xmath3 and @xmath7 dependence of the shot noise in arrays without ground plane .",
    "returning to arrays near ground plane , with their simple electrostatics , we have explored the behavior of shot noise in the presence of random background charges on the islands , @xmath143 .",
    "these charges can represent , for example , the effect of charged impurities in a substrate .",
    "the charge @xmath144 placed on each island was randomly selected@xcite , using a uniform probability distribution between @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "( any integer part of the background charge would immediately be compensated by trapping one or a few tunneling electrons or holes . )",
    "the @xmath83 curves which stem from the monte carlo simulation of such arrays still show the progression from shot noise to suppressed shot noise , but at larger values of @xmath7 tend to feature strong , irregular peaks ( fig .",
    "[ s - i ] ) where curves for arrays without background charge were smooth .",
    "occasionally these peaks in the @xmath83 curve cause it to cross the @xmath147 line more than once . in such cases ,",
    "we arbitrarily define @xmath4 as the lowest crossing value .",
    "it turns out that the variation in the general location of @xmath4 among different instantiations of @xmath143 is large enough to make the distinctions among different crossing points on a single curve irrelevant .",
    "figure [ q0-ic - l ] shows the average value of @xmath4 and its standard deviation of over ensembles of 50 different @xmath143 realizations .",
    "strikingly , for @xmath148 , @xmath4 for all values of @xmath3 appears to fall on the same , almost flat curve .",
    "this behavior is in sharp contrast to results for similar arrays without background charge ( fig .",
    "[ tri - ic - nl ] ) .",
    "this quasi - universal value of @xmath4 is @xmath149 .",
    "although there appears to be weak downward trend in @xmath8 with increasing @xmath7 for , this trend is virtually hidden within the relatively large standard deviation .",
    "let us try to comprehend this result .",
    "simulation shows that in such arrays the typical tunneling process near the crossover is due to several ( rather than one ) electron - hole pairs moving simultaneously in the array .",
    "( due to this multiplicity , a fixed - scenario calculation of noise would not make sense . )",
    "this effect is easy to explain .",
    "the electric potential induced by the background charges creates a series of charge traps .",
    "so , as the applied voltage is increased , the first several charges to enter the array are trapped , forming a `` sandpile''@xcite of charge ( see fig .  [ sandpile ] ) .",
    "the final energy profile in the sandpile is still random , though the maximum possible energy change @xmath150 is now upwardly bound by @xmath151 .",
    "the remaining disorder is , however , strong enough to overcome the interaction of distant charges , which is exponentially weak in arrays over a ground plane .",
    "this argument also explains why the crossover current is independent of the array length .",
    "we are , however , still in need of an analytical theory which would explain the virtual independence of the average crossover on @xmath152 , and also would predict its universal value cited above .",
    "we have used both monte carlo and fixed scenario techniques to calculate the low - frequency current noise for three different models of 1d single - electron - tunneling arrays . within each of the three models",
    ", we find a crossover of the spectral density of current fluctuations , @xmath0 , from the schottky value @xmath153 , to the `` reduced schottky '' value @xmath154 , with increasing current .",
    "the crossover can be well characterized in terms of the crossover current @xmath4 , which may be said to mark the onset of quasicontinuous charge transfer .",
    "the particular behavior of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath7 depends on the interaction of electrons within the array and on the interaction of electrons with the external field .    for arrays near ground plane , with no background charge ,",
    "the crossover current exhibits a universal behavior that is a function of only the product @xmath110 , i.e. of the ratio of the array length @xmath3 to the length @xmath155 of single - electron solitons . at @xmath156",
    "the dependence is exponential : @xmath157 .",
    "our analysis has shown that this behavior is the result of the exponential decrease of the soliton interaction with the external electrodes and its counterpart in the electron - hole pair .    in arrays without a ground plane , @xmath4 is almost independent of @xmath3 and exhibits a nearly - universal weak decrease with @xmath152 .",
    "we believe that the substantial difference in results between this model and the previous model is due to the long - range electrostatic interactions , which were screened by the ground plane in the previous model .    finally , in arrays with random @xmath143",
    ", we have found that the crossover takes place at a nearly universal value of current , @xmath158 .",
    "the absence of noise dependence on the array length can be readily explained as a result of the random potential created by the background charges , which overwhelms long range order in the arrays .",
    "however , the independence of noise on the single - electron soliton length still has to be explained .",
