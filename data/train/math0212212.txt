    "the deployment of large groups of autonomous vehicles is rapidly becoming possible because of technological advances in networking and in miniaturization of electro - mechanical systems . in the near future large numbers of robots",
    "will coordinate their actions through ad - hoc communication networks and will perform challenging tasks including search and recovery operations , manipulation in hazardous environments , exploration , surveillance , and environmental monitoring for pollution detection and estimation .",
    "the potential advantages of employing teams of agents are numerous .",
    "for instance , certain tasks are difficult , if not impossible , when performed by a single vehicle agent .",
    "further , a group of vehicles inherently provides robustness to failures of single agents or communication links .",
    "working prototypes of active sensing networks have already been developed ; see  @xcite . in  @xcite , launchable miniature mobile robots communicate through a wireless network . the vehicles are equipped with sensors for vibrations , acoustic , magnetic , and ir signals as well as an active video module ( i.e. , the camera or micro - radar is controlled via a pan - tilt unit ) .",
    "a second system is suggested in  @xcite under the name of autonomous oceanographic sampling network ; see also  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "underwater vehicles are envisioned measuring temperature , currents , and other distributed oceanographic signals .",
    "the vehicles communicate via an acoustic local area network and coordinate their motion in response to local sensing information and to evolving global data . this mobile sensing network is meant to provide the ability to sample the environment adaptively in space and time . by identifying evolving temperature and current gradients with higher accuracy and resolution than current static sensors ,",
    "this technology could lead to the development and validation of improved oceanographic models .",
    "a fundamental prototype problem in this paper is that of characterizing and optimizing notions of quality - of - service provided by an adaptive sensor network in a dynamic environment . to this goal ,",
    "we introduce a notion of _ sensor coverage _ that formalizes an optimal sensor placement problem .",
    "this spatial resource allocation problem is the subject of a discipline called locational optimization  @xcite .",
    "locational optimization problems pervade a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines .",
    "biologists rely on locational optimization tools to study how animals share territory and to characterize the behavior of animal groups obeying the following interaction rule : each animal establishes a region of dominance and moves toward its center .",
    "locational optimization problems are spatial resource allocation problems ( where to place mailboxes in a city or cache servers on the internet ) and play a central role in quantization and information theory ( the design of a minimum - distortion fixed - rate vector quantizer is a locational problem ) .",
    "other technologies affected by locational optimization include mesh and grid optimization methods , clustering analysis , data compression , and statistical pattern recognition .",
    "because locational optimization problems are so widely studied , it is not surprising that methods are indeed available to tackle coverage problems ; see  @xcite . however , most currently - available algorithms are not applicable to mobile sensing networks because they inherently assume a centralized computation for a limited size problem in a known static environment .",
    "this is not the case in multi - vehicle networks which , instead , rely on a distributed communication and computation architecture .",
    "although an ad - hoc wireless network provides the ability to share some information , no global omniscient leader might be present to coordinate the group .",
    "the inherent spatially - distributed nature and limited communication capabilities of a mobile network invalidate classic approaches to algorithm design .",
    "in this paper we design coordination algorithms implementable by a multi - vehicle network with limited sensing and communication capabilities .",
    "our approach is related to the classic lloyd algorithm from quantization theory ; see  @xcite for a reprint of the original report and @xcite for a historical overview .",
    "we present lloyd descent algorithms that take into careful consideration all constraints on the mobile sensing network . in particular",
    ", we design coverage algorithms that are adaptive , distributed , asynchronous , and verifiably asymptotically correct :    adaptive : : :    our coverage algorithms provide the network with the ability to    address changing environments , sensing task , and network topology ( due    to agents departures , arrivals , or failures ) . distributed : : :    our coverage algorithms are distributed in the sense that the behavior    of each vehicle depends only on the location of its neighbors .",
    "also ,    our algorithms do not required a fixed - topology communication graph ,    i.e. , the neighborhood relationships do change as the network evolves .",
    "the advantages of distributed algorithms are scalability and    robustness .",
    "asynchronous : : :    our coverage algorithms are amenable to asynchronous implementation .",
    "this means that the algorithms can be implemented in a network    composed of agents evolving at different speeds , with different    computation and communication capabilities .",
    "furthermore , our    algorithms do not require a global synchronization and convergence    properties are preserved even if information about neighboring    vehicles propagates with some delay .",
    "an advantage of asynchronism is a    minimized communication overhead .",
    "verifiable asymptotically correct : : :    our algorithms guarantees monotonic descent of the cost function    encoding the sensing task .",
    "asymptotically the evolution of the mobile    sensing network is guaranteed to converge to so - called centroidal    voronoi configurations that are critical points of the optimal sensor    coverage problem .",
    "let us describe in some detail what are the contributions of this paper .",
    "section  [ sec : review ] reviews certain locational optimization problems and their solutions as centroidal voronoi partitions .",
    "section  [ sec : coverage - control ] provides a continuous - time version of the classic lloyd algorithm from vector quantization and applies it to the setting of multi - vehicle networks . in discrete - time",
    ", we propose a family of lloyd algorithms .",
    "we carefully characterize convergence properties for both continuous and discrete - time versions ( appendix  [ sec : appendix ] collects some relevant facts on descent flows ) .",
    "we discuss a worst - case optimization problem , we investigate a simple uniform planar setting , and we present numerical results .",
    "section  [ sec : distributed - asynchronous ] presents two asynchronous distributed implementations of lloyd algorithm for ad - hoc networks with communication and sensing capabilities .",
    "our treatment carefully accounts for the constraints imposed by the distributed nature of the vehicle network .",
    "we present two asynchronous implementations , one based on classic results on distributed gradient flows , the other based on the structure of the coverage problem .",
    "section  [ sec : vehicle - dynamics ] considers vehicle models with more realistic dynamics .",
    "we present two formal results on passive vehicle dynamics and on vehicles equipped with individual local controllers .",
    "we present numerical simulations of passive vehicle models and of unicycle mobile vehicles .",
    "next , section  [ sec : geometric - patterns ] describes density functions that lead the multi - vehicle network to predetermined geometric patterns .",
    "recent years have witnessed a large research effort focused on motion planning and coordination problems for multi - vehicle systems .",
    "issues include geometric patterns @xcite , formation control  @xcite , and conflict avoidance  @xcite .",
    "algorithms for robotic sensing tasks are presented for example in  @xcite .",
    "it is only recently , however , that truly distributed coordination laws for dynamic networks are being proposed ; e.g. , see  @xcite and the conference versions of this work  @xcite .",
    "heuristic approaches to the design of interaction rules and emerging behaviors have been throughly investigated within the literature on behavior - based robotics ; see  @xcite .",
    "an example of coverage control is discussed in  @xcite . along this line of research ,",
    "algorithms have been designed for sophisticated cooperative tasks .",
    "however , no formal results are currently available on how to design reactive control laws , ensure their correctness , and guarantee their optimality with respect to an aggregate objective .",
    "the study of distributed algorithms is concerned with providing mathematical models , devising precise specifications for their behavior , and formally proving their correctness and complexity . via an automata - theoretic approach , the references  @xcite treat distributed consensus , resource allocation , communication , and data consistency problems . from a numerical optimization viewpoint , the works in  @xcite",
    "discuss distributed asynchronous algorithms as networking algorithms , rate and flow control , and gradient descent flows .",
    "typically , both these sets of references consider networks with fixed topology , and do not address algorithms over ad - hoc dynamically changing networks .",
    "another common assumption is that , any time an agent communicates its location , it broadcasts it to every other agent in the network . in our setting",
    ", this would require a non - distributed communication set - up .",
    "in this section we describe a collection of known facts about a meaningful optimization problem .",
    "references include the theory and applications of centroidal voronoi partitions , see  @xcite , and the discipline of facility location , see  @xcite . along the paper",
    ", we interchangeably refer to the elements of the network as sensors , agents , vehicles , or robots .",
    "let @xmath0 be a convex polytope in @xmath1 and let @xmath2  denote the euclidean distance function .",
    "we call a map @xmath3  a _ distribution density function _ if it represents a measure of information or probability that some event take place over @xmath0 . in equivalent words",
    ", we can consider @xmath0 to be the bounded support of the function @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the _ location of  @xmath6 sensors _ , each moving in the space  @xmath0 .",
    "because of noise and loss of resolution , the _ sensing performance _ at point  @xmath7 taken from @xmath8th sensor at the position @xmath9 degrades with the distance @xmath10 between @xmath7 and @xmath9 ; we describe this degradation with a non - decreasing differentiable function @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath12 provides a quantitative assessment of how poor the sensing performance is .    as an example , consider @xmath6 mobile robots equipped with microphones attempting to detect , identify , and localize a sound - source .",
    "_ how should we plan to robots motion in order to maximize the detection probability ? _ assuming the source emits a known signal , the optimal detection algorithm is a matched filter ( i.e. , convolve the known waveform with the received signal and threshold ) .",
    "the source is detected depending on the signal - to - noise - ratio , which is inversely proportional to the distance between the microphone and the source .",
    "various electromagnetic and sound sensors have signal - to - noise ratios inversely proportional to distance .    within the context of this paper ,",
    "a _ partition _ of @xmath0 is a collection of @xmath6 polytopes @xmath13 with disjoint interiors whose union is @xmath0 .",
    "we say that two partitions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are equal if @xmath16 and @xmath17 only differ by a set of @xmath4-measure zero , for all @xmath18 .",
    "we consider the task of minimizing the locational optimization function @xmath19 where we assume that the @xmath8th sensor is responsible for measurements over its `` dominance region ''  @xmath16 .",
    "note that the function @xmath20 is to be minimized with respect to both ( 1 ) the sensors location @xmath21 , and ( 2 ) the assignment of the dominance regions @xmath14 .",
    "this problem is referred to as a facility location problem and in particular as a continuous @xmath22-median problem in  @xcite .",
    "note that if we interchange the positions of any two agents , along with their associated regions of dominance , the value of the locational optimization function @xmath20 is not affected . to eliminate this discrete redundancy",
    ", one could take the discrete group of permutations @xmath23 with the natural action on @xmath24 , and consider @xmath25 as the configuration space for the position @xmath21 of the @xmath6 vehicles .",
    "one can easily see that , at fixed sensors location , the optimal partition of @xmath0 is the _ voronoi partition _",
    "@xmath26 generated by the points @xmath27 : @xmath28 we refer to  @xcite for a comprehensive treatment on voronoi diagrams , and briefly present some relevant concepts .",
    "the set of regions @xmath29  is called the voronoi diagram for the generators @xmath30 .",
    "when the two voronoi regions @xmath31  and @xmath32  are adjacent , @xmath9 is called a _ ( voronoi ) neighbor _ of @xmath33 ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "the set of indexes of the voronoi neighbors of @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath34 . clearly , @xmath35 if and only if @xmath36 .",
    "we also define the @xmath37-face as @xmath38 .",
    "voronoi diagrams can be defined with respect to various distance functions , e.g. , the @xmath39- , @xmath40- , @xmath41- , and @xmath42-norm over @xmath43 , and voronoi diagrams can be defined over riemannian manifolds ; see  @xcite .",
    "some useful facts about the euclidean setting are the following : if @xmath0 is a convex polytope in a @xmath44-dimensional euclidean space , the boundary of each @xmath31  is the union of @xmath45-dimensional convex polytopes .    in",

    "remarkably , one can show  @xcite that @xmath48 and deduce some smoothness properties of @xmath49 .",
    "since the voronoi partition @xmath50 depends at least continuously on @xmath51 , the function @xmath49 is at least continuously differentiable .",
    "let us recall some basic quantities associated to a region @xmath52 and a mass density function @xmath53 .",
    "the ( generalized ) mass , centroid ( or center of mass ) , and polar moment of inertia are defined as @xmath54 additionally , by the parallel axis theorem , one can write , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is defined as the polar moment of inertia of the region @xmath57 about its centroid .",
    "let us consider again the locational optimization problem  , and suppose now we are strictly interested in the setting @xmath58 that is , we assume @xmath59 . applying the parallel axis theorem leads to simplifications for both the function @xmath49 and its partial derivative : @xmath60 it is convenient to define @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    therefore , the ( not necessarily unique ) local minimum points for the location optimization function @xmath49 are _ centroids _ of their voronoi cells , i.e. , each location @xmath9 satisfies two properties simultaneously : it is the generator for the voronoi cell @xmath31 and it is its centroid @xmath63 accordingly , the critical partitions and points for @xmath20 are called _ centroidal voronoi partitions_. we will refer to a sensors configuration as a _ centroidal voronoi configuration _ if it gives rise to a centroidal voronoi partition .",
    "this discussion provides a proof alternative to the one given in  @xcite for the necessity of centroidal voronoi partitions as solutions to the continuous @xmath22-median location problem .",
    "in this section , we describe algorithms to compute the location of sensors that minimize the cost @xmath20 , both in continuous and in discrete - time . in section  [ se : continuous - lloyd ] , we propose a continuous - time version of the classic lloyd algorithm . here , both the positions and partitions evolve in continuous time , whereas lloyd algorithm for vector quantization is designed in discrete time . in section  [ se : discrete - lloyd ] , we develop a family of variations of lloyd algorithm in discrete time . in both setting , we prove that the proposed algorithms are _ gradient descent flows_.      assume the sensors location obeys a first order dynamical behavior described by @xmath64 consider @xmath49 a cost function to be minimized and impose that the location @xmath9 follows a gradient descent . in equivalent control theoretical terms , consider @xmath49 a lyapunov function and stabilize the multi - vehicle system to one of its local minima via dissipative control .",
    "formally , we set @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a positive gain , and where we assume that the partition @xmath26 is continuously updated .    for the closed - loop system induced by equation  , the sensors location converges asymptotically to the set of critical points of  @xmath67 , i.e. , the set of centroidal voronoi configurations on @xmath0 . assuming this set is finite , the sensors location converges to a centroidal voronoi configuration .    under the control law",
    ", we have @xmath68 by lasalle s principle , the sensors location converges to the largest invariant set contained in @xmath69 , which is precisely the set of centroidal voronoi configurations .",
    "since this set is clearly invariant for  , we get the stated result .",
    "if @xmath69 consists of a finite collection of points , then @xmath70 converges to one of them , see corollary  [ corollary : lasalle - finite ] .    if @xmath69 is finite , and @xmath71 , then a sufficient condition that guarantees exponential convergence is that the hessian of @xmath67 be positive definite at @xmath72 .",
    "this property is known to be an open problem , see  @xcite .",
    "note that this gradient descent is not guaranteed to find the global minimum .",
    "for example , in the vector quantization and signal processing literature  @xcite , it is known that for bimodal distribution density functions , the solution to the gradient flow reaches local minima where the number of generators allocated to the two region of maxima are not optimally partitioned .",
    "let us consider the following class of variations of lloyd algorithm .",
    "let @xmath73 be a continuous mapping @xmath74 verifying the following two properties :    \\(a ) for all @xmath75 , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the @xmath8th component of @xmath73 ,    \\(b ) if @xmath21 is not centroidal , then there exists a @xmath78 such that @xmath79 .",
    "property ( a ) guarantees that , if moving , the agents of the network do not increase their distance to its corresponding centroid .",
    "property ( b ) ensures that at least one robot moves at each iteration and strictly approaches the centroid of its voronoi region .",
    "because of this property , the fixed points of @xmath73 are the set of centroidal voronoi configurations .    [ prop : discrete - lloyd ] let @xmath80 @xmath81 denote the initial sensors location .",
    "then , the sequence @xmath82 converges to the set of centroidal voronoi configurations . if this set if finite , then @xmath83 converges to a centroidal voronoi configuration .",
    "consider @xmath84 as an objective function for the algorithm @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath85 with strict inequality if @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , the parallel axis theorem guarantees @xmath87 as long as @xmath88 for all @xmath89 , with strict inequality if for any @xmath8 , @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , @xmath91 , with strict inequality if @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes the set of centroids of the partition @xmath14 .",
    "now , we have @xmath94 because of  .",
    "in addition , because of property ( a ) of @xmath73 , inequality   yields @xmath95 and the inequality is strict if @xmath21 is not centroidal by property ( b ) of @xmath73 .",
    "hence , @xmath67 is a descent function for the algorithm @xmath73 .",
    "the result now follows from the global convergence theorem  [ lemma : discrete - lasalle ] and proposition  [ prop : discrete - lasalle - surprising ] .",
    "lloyd algorithm in quantization theory  @xcite is usually presented as follows : given the location of @xmath6 agents , @xmath96 , ( i ) construct the voronoi partition corresponding to @xmath5 ; ( ii ) compute the mass centroids of the voronoi regions found in step ( i ) .",
    "set the new location of the agents to these centroids ; and return to step ( i ) .",

    "therefore , @xmath102 verifies properties ( a ) and  ( b ) .",
    "different sensor performance functions @xmath107 in equation   correspond to different optimization problems .",
    "provided one uses the euclidean distance in the definition of @xmath108 , the standard voronoi partition computed with respect to the euclidean metric remains the optimal partition . for arbitrary @xmath107 ,",
    "it is not possible anymore to decompose @xmath67 into the sum of terms similar to @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible to implement the gradient flow via the expression for the partial derivative  .",
    "assume the sensors location obeys a first order dynamical behavior , @xmath111 .",

    "more generally , various distance notions can be used to define locational optimization functions .",
    "different performance function gives rise to corresponding notions of `` center of a region '' ( any notion of geometric center , mean , or average is an interesting candidate ) .",
    "these can then be adopted in designing coverage algorithms .",
