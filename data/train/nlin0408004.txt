    "a standard tool for studying chaotic behavior in dynamical systems is the computation of the characteristic lyapunov exponents , which measure the typical exponential growth rate of an infinitesimal disturbance @xcite .",
    "the characteristic lyapunov exponents in extended systems are defined in a similar way as their low - dimensional counterpart and can be calculated from the linearization of the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the main point is that the growth of an infinitesimal perturbation is described by the linear equations for the tangent space , the so - called lyapunov vectors ( see below ) .",
    "however , for many practical purposes the dynamics of infinitesimal perturbations may be irrelevant as indicators of , for instance , the predictability time .",
    "indeed , in many realistic situations the error in the initial conditions is finite .",
    "the important fact is that the evolution of finite errors is not confined to the tangent space , as defined by the growth of linearized perturbations , but is controlled by the complete non - linear dynamics .",
    "a good example with important practical application occurs in weather forecasting , where one deals with the whole earth",
    "s atmosphere an extremely high dimensional system in which initial conditions can be determined only with limited accuracy .",
    "the effects of finite perturbations have recently been studied in the context of fully developed turbulence @xcite . in order to deal with realistic perturbations , the concept of finite size lyapunov exponents has been found to be useful to analyze predictability in high - dimensional chaotic systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of random spatially distributed finite - size errors in chaotic extended systems and focus on their propagation dynamics .",
    "we argue that , after a suitable transformation of variables , the dynamics of finite perturbations can be interpreted as a kinetic roughening process in the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class @xcite .",
    "we find that , due to the finiteness of the initial error , there is a characteristic time scale @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the largest lyapunov exponent , @xmath0 is a measure of the initial size of the perturbation , and @xmath3 is a constant . for times",
    "@xmath4 the dynamic evolution of a finite perturbation is governed by the lyapunov vector . in this regime ,",
    "finite perturbations become spatially correlated up to a typical length scale @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the dynamic exponent of the kpz problem ( @xmath10 for one dimensional systems ) . however , for times @xmath11 any finite perturbation leaves the tangent space and is no longer described by the lyapunov vectors . in this late regime , memory of spatial correlations is progressively destroyed and perturbations actually become white noise in space and time .",
    "our approach provides new tools for studying chaotic extended systems by allowing to fully describe the spread of correlations , to estimate the spatial extend of correlations of the chaotic field and to measure the effective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we exemplify our results by means of numerical simulations of coupled map lattices in one dimension , which are simple model systems exhibiting space - time chaos and convenient as far as the computing time is concerned .",
    "we consider a coupled map array consisting of @xmath12 chaotic oscillators given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a chaotic map , @xmath16 is the coupling constant , and periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "we have fixed the coupling to @xmath17 in all the simulations presented in this paper .",
    "we have carried out simulations for two different choices of the map , the chaotic logistic map @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the tent map @xmath20 , @xmath19 . for the sake of brevity ,",
    "all the results we present below correspond to coupled logistic maps , but similar results were obtained for the tent map .",
    "the dynamics of _ infinitesimal _ perturbations of a turbulent state @xmath21 can be studied by linearizing the evolution equation eq .",
    "( [ cml ] ) .",
    "this leads to the tangent space equations or lyapunov vector @xmath22 evolution equation @xmath23\\,\\delta u(x+1,t)\\ , + \\nonumber\\\\ \\nu\\ , f'[u(x-1,t)]\\,\\delta u(x-1,t)\\ , + \\nonumber\\\\ ( 1 - 2\\,\\nu)\\,f'[u(x , t)]\\,\\delta u(x , t)\\ , + o[(\\delta u)^2 ] \\label{lyap - cml}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 = df(y)/dy \\vert_{u(x , t)}$ ] .",
    "this implies to solve simultaneously the field @xmath25 evolution equation ( [ cml ] ) .",
    "the lyapunov vector is defined in the linear approximation , when higher order corrections @xmath26 $ ] are neglected .",
    "the analysis of infinitesimal perturbations allows to compute several indicators characterizing the chaotic system , including the whole spectrum of lyapunov exponents and investigate how this depends on system size @xcite .",
    "however , as explained above , there are indeed many situations where the lyapunov analysis has no relevance due , for instance , to the finite nature of the initial errors .",
    "let us now consider the evolution of random finite - size perturbed trajectories in our model system ( [ cml ] ) .",
    "given an initial condition @xmath27 , the solution @xmath21 is univocally determined by computing eq .",
    "( [ cml ] ) for a number @xmath28 of time steps .",
    "this is our reference trajectory and we are interested in the evolution of finite perturbations around that reference solution . for reasons that will become clear below",
    ", we find convenient to introduce now what we call the _ amplitude factor _ @xmath29 as the spatial geometrical mean value of a perturbation : @xmath30 as we shall see below , the amplitude factor turns out to be a very important quantity which contains the information about the dominant exponential growth rate .",
    "since we are interested here in the propagation of real ( non - infinitesimal ) errors , we should avoid linearization of eq.([cml ] ) .",
    "instead , we compute the trajectories generated by iterating ( [ cml ] ) for an ensemble of initial conditions @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a random finite perturbation of initial amplitude @xmath33 . for each iteration of the lattice ( [ cml ] ) the difference @xmath34 between the reference trajectory and every one of the perturbed solutions is calculated .",
    "although the disturbances are initially random and uncorrelated in space , as time goes by , they grow and get spatially correlated .",
    "the statistical fluctuations of errors can be characterized by studying the ensemble of finite perturbations @xmath35 , which correspond to @xmath36 independent realizations of the initial perturbation .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in fig .",
    "1 ( upper panel ) we plot @xmath37 _ vs. _ time for different values of the initial perturbation amplitude @xmath0 , where @xmath38 stands for average over realizations of the initial perturbation .",
    "one can immediately see that there exists a characteristic time scale @xmath39 such that for times @xmath40 the average amplitude factor grows exponentially in time @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "we demonstrate below that @xmath43 indeed corresponds to the maximal lyapunov exponent . for longer times , @xmath44 the amplitude factor saturates to a constant value .",
    "both , the saturation constant and the maximal lyapunov exponent , are independent of the initial perturbation size @xmath0 . however , the saturation times @xmath39 increase as the size of the initial perturbation @xmath0 becomes smaller .",
    "the characteristic time scale @xmath6 corresponds to the crossover time at which the dynamics of a finite size perturbation depart from the linear evolution ( _ i.e. _ the lyapunov vectors ) given by eq.([lyap - cml ] ) .",
    "this crossover occurs because lyapunov vectors describe only the behavior of strictly infinitesimal perturbations .",
    "one can estimate @xmath6 roughly as the time at which @xmath29 reaches some @xmath45 , so that the higher order terms @xmath26 $ ] can not be neglected in the evolution equation ( [ lyap - cml ] ) .",
    "this crossover takes place at a typical time @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , for times @xmath44 nonlinear corrections , due to finiteness of the initial perturbation , come into play and drive errors out of the tangent space . from then on",
    ", the linear approximation can not describe the evolution of errors .",
    "one then expects that @xmath47 as @xmath48 .    besides exponential growth ,",
    "spatial correlations are dynamically generated during the evolution of the perturbation .",
    "correlations contain information about the sub - leading lyapunov exponents and thus also contribute to the perturbation size growth .",
    "the important role of correlations can be better realized after subtraction of the dominant exponential growth component given by @xmath29 .",
    "we find that a very useful indicator is given by the _ reduced _",
    "perturbations @xmath49 that we define as @xmath50 where the dominant exponential growth is globally removed and one is left with the effect of correlations . for random initial errors , _",
    "i.e. _ random spatially distributed initial conditions , the average @xmath51 vanishes , where @xmath38 stands for average over realizations of the initial perturbation and the over bar is a spatial average .",
    "thus , statistical fluctuations of the reduced perturbations are measured by the variance @xmath52 . as we shall see below",
    ", @xmath53 gives information about the growth of perturbations due solely to correlations .    in fig .",
    "1 ( lower panel ) we show our numerical results for the variance of the reduced perturbations , eq.([reduced ] ) .",
    "the variance @xmath54 grows as @xmath55 for times @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ before saturation occurs due to finiteness of the initial disturbance .",
    "this scaling behavior is better seen in fig .  2 where we plot in log - log scale @xmath56 _ vs. _ time and the exponent @xmath57 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "as before , this rapid growth occurs for times @xmath4 when the dynamics of disturbances are well described by the lyapunov vectors .",
    "one can determine the crossover time @xmath6 from fig .",
    "1 , either by measuring the saturation times of @xmath29 ( upper panel ) or by measuring the time shift of the maxima of @xmath54 ( lower panel ) . results are shown in the inset of fig .  2 , where a straight line fit of the data leads to @xmath58 with @xmath3 a constant . the slope of the fit @xmath59 is in excellent agreement with our previous determination of @xmath60 from the exponential growth of the amplitude factor @xmath61 .",

    "site correlation function @xmath62 .",
    "the magnitude of spatial correlations increases in time @xmath63 if @xmath64 for times @xmath65 .",
    "however , as shown in fig.3 , correlations become progressively smaller for times @xmath66 .",
    "this again demonstrates that the effect of having initially finite perturbations is to introduce a characteristic time @xmath39 marking the typical time it takes for the system to depart from tangent space ( with the building - up of correlations ) to non - linear evolution ( uncorrelated errors ) . for times larger than @xmath6 the perturbation spatial correlation are progressively destroyed , as can be seen from the decay of the correlations @xmath67 in fig .",
    "further fourier spectrum analysis @xcite shows that errors actually become undistinguishable from white noise .",
    "in order to make a theoretical interpretation of our numerical results , in particular the existence of scaling behavior , we can resort to the hopf - cole transformation , first proposed by pikovsky and politi for the actual lyapunov vectors @xcite , that allows to link spreading of errors to non - equilibrium surface growth .",
    "we find that the dynamics of finite perturbations can also be seen as a kinetic roughening processes of the surface defined by @xmath68 .",
    "this is a very useful transformation that allows us to borrow some well - known results in the field of nonequilibrium surface growth .",
    "indeed , politi and pikovsky @xcite have shown that errors in many extended systems lead to surface growth process in the universality class of kpz @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the amplitude factor defined in eq.([amplitude ] ) and show that it is related to the average surface velocity .",
    "we can write @xmath69 $ ] and thus @xmath70 = \\exp[\\overline{h}(t)]$ ] .",
    "we then obtain that the amplitude factor must grow as @xmath71 , where @xmath2 is the largest lyapunov exponent and corresponds in this mapping to the surface velocity , @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "direct measures of the average surface velocity ( not shown ) are in excellent agreement with our above discussed estimations of @xmath43 . as an independent check we have also measured the largest lyapunov exponent by standard techniques @xcite .",

    "where @xmath75 .",
    "we can now proceed and calculate @xmath76 explicitly by considering the cumulant generating function of the stochastic variable @xmath77 given by @xmath78 @xcite , where @xmath79 is the imaginary unit .",

    "in general , no closed simple formula exists for the cumulant of order @xmath84 of a given variable @xmath77 , but the first cumulants are given by @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , etc @xcite . in our case @xmath88 and the second cumulant @xmath89 corresponds to the surface width @xmath90 ^ 2}\\rangle$ ] . to leading order",
    "we have @xmath91.\\ ] ] higher order cumulants are also finite , but their contribution to the series gets smaller as @xmath84 increases .",
    "we have checked numerically that including the 3rd and 4rd cumulants shifts the exponent in less that a 10% .",
    "therefore , within this somewhat crude approximation , eq.([gaussian ] ) , we expect to have an estimation of the _ effective _ scaling exponent of @xmath92 with less than a 10% error bar .",
    "a clarification is now in order . for systems in which the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath93 one would expect to have larger crossover times @xmath6 , so that higher order cumulants may eventually become relevant , yielding corrections to eq.([gaussian ] ) . in this sense",
    "the scaling picture has to be considered as approximate .",
    "however , the scaling approach is consistent for hyper - chaotic systems , as those we are interested here , in which not only the leading lyapunov exponent is finite , but a series of finite positive lyapunov exponents exists and whose number increases with the system size .",
    "the ansatz of a kpz behavior for the surface @xmath94 then implies that the width should scale as @xmath95 for times @xmath96 and saturates to a size dependent value , @xmath97 for @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the growth and roughness exponent , respectively , that are known to take the values @xmath101 and @xmath102 for the kpz universality class in one dimension @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the approximate @xmath103 scaling observed in fig .  2 , baring in mind the limitation of the approximation ( [ gaussian ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that all the numerical results presented here are obtained for system sizes such that @xmath104 , so that the existence of @xmath6 could be clearly observed .",

    "we have introduced what we call the amplitude factor @xmath29 in eq.([amplitude ] ) and showed that this quantity is directly related to the maximal lyapunov exponent and exhibits nice scaling properties .",
    "the amplitude factor allows us to remove in a simple and self - consistent way the dominant growth component of the perturbation at every time step , so that spatial correlations can be determined more easily . at variance with infinitesimal perturbations ,",
    "finite - size errors lead to a characteristic time scale @xmath39 signaling the departure of the finite perturbation from the linear approach . for times",
    "@xmath105 the evolution is nonlinear and spatial correlations are destroyed .",
    "we have found that the perturbation variance grows as @xmath106 , once the contribution of the largest growth rate is removed .",
    "we have explained this behavior by representing the error growth as a kinetically rough 1d kpz surface .",
    "the interpretation of the exponentially growing errors @xmath107 as a roughening surface @xmath108 has many advantages since it allows to translate the problem of analyzing deterministic chaotic fluctuations into the simpler framework of kinetic roughening of the associated surface @xmath109 .",
