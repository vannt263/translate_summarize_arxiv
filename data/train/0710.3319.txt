    "in the last decade or so , there has been a great increase of interest in the theory of random graphs and networks ( in the following we will use those two terms interchangeably ) .",
    "while in principle this is a branch of mathematics , much of this effort was fueled by the availability of `` experimental '' data on real graphs ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "these data are compared to the predictions of various random graphs models .",
    "probably the best known and simplest example of such reference models is the ensemble of all labeled graphs with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath1 links ( without multiple- and self - links ) , chosen with uniform probability .",
    "we will call this model erds - rnyi ( er ) graphs after the authors , who were the first to introduce and study them @xcite .",
    "the er ensemble is the simplest example of the so - called `` maximally random '' graphs .",
    "intuitively those are the ensembles where the distributions of vertices and links joining them are `` as random as possible '' for a given set of constraints . in the case of er graphs",
    "the only constraints are the fixed number of links and vertices .",
    "the `` maximal randomness '' can be formalized using the notion of _ entropy _ ( see next section ) .",
    "the maximally random ensembles serve as null hypothesis .",
    "for example , it was the deviation of data collected on the world wide web ( www ) graph from the predictions of the er model that triggered the interest in random networks @xcite , because it implied that those graphs were not created just by joining vertices at random , but required the existence of another mechanism @xcite",
    ".    a popular generalization of the er ensemble are graphs with a given degree distribution ( degree of a node is the number of links attached to it ) @xcite .",
    "one feature of those ensembles is the absence of correlations between neighboring nodes degrees , at least for degree distributions without heavy tails ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : sf ] ) .",
    "the object of our study was to find what happens when we constrain to connected graphs only .",
    "a simple argument indicated that correlations would appear : a neighbor of a node with degree one ( leaf ) must have its degree greater than 1 ; otherwise , they would form a separate connected component .",
    "similarly , all neighbors of a node can not have their degree equal to 1 , as such a `` hedgehog '' would also form a separate connected component @xcite .",
    "this obviously leads to correlations .",
    "it is not clear , however , how strong they are and if they survive the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we have already studied those correlations numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite and found that they also appear in large graphs . in this paper",
    "we derive the analytic formulas describing them .",
    "we also found a strong indication that the described mechanism is the only one responsible for the correlation in maximally random connected graphs : when we forbid vertices with degree 1 correlations disappear .",
    "connectivity is a nonlocal constraint hard to deal with . to study the properties of connected graphs we use another feature of maximally random graphs with a given degree distribution : the appearance of a connected component that includes a finite fraction of all the vertices ( and links ) . from the properties of this giant connected component we can infer the properties of connected graphs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : basic ] introduces some basic definitions concerning random graphs . in sec .",
    "[ sec : connected ] we present the method of generating functions used to study the properties of the giant connected component in random graphs with arbitrary degree distribution @xcite .",
    "then we calculate degree - degree correlations in the giant component .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] contains some examples where we compare our predictions with the results of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . finally , we show in sec .  [",
    "sec : connectedgraphs ] how to relate connected random graphs to giant connected components in other ensembles .",
    "[ sec : uncorrelatedconnectedgraphs ] we address the situation when correlations in random graphs are suppressed by the absence of vertices with degree one ( leaves ) .",
    "the paper is summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "formally we consider random graphs as an ensemble of graphs @xmath2 with probability @xmath3 assigned to every graph @xmath4 . using this definition we introduce the entropy of the ensemble : @xmath5 the maximally random ensembles described in the previous section are those which for given constraints have maximal entropy .    denoting by @xmath6 some property of graph @xmath7",
    "we can calculate its average over the whole ensemble : @xmath8 the most widely studied example is the probability distribution of node degrees : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of vertices with degree @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the total number of vertices in graph @xmath7 ( in the following we will often omit the argument @xmath7 ) .",
    "the mean of this distribution is the `` link density , '' @xmath13 because @xmath14 ; by @xmath15 , we denote the number of links in graph @xmath7",
    ".    however , what is frequently observed is not an average , but the properties of a single graph ( e.g. , www ) .",
    "that is why we are actually interested in the probability that our model will produce a graph with those properties .",
    "it is described by the distribution @xmath16 in many cases this distribution is sufficiently well characterized by its mean with relative fluctuations disappearing in the large-@xmath0 limit . in this situation",
    "we will say the @xmath17 is self - averaging .",
    "in such a case one can infer the properties of the whole ensemble from the properties of just one large graph .",
    "we want to emphasize , however , that this is only an assumption that has to be checked for each particular model ( see @xcite for a discussion of self - averaging in real graphs ) .    in appendix",
    "[ app : non - sa ] we show for illustration a definition of a non - self - averaging ensemble .",
    "although this is an artificial example , let it serve as a warning .",
    "in this paper we assume that our models are self - averaging without any further formal proofs .",
    "we end with the following comment : as in the self - averaging ensemble fluctuations do not matter , in the large - volume limit we have @xmath18 we will use this kind of approximations in the following sections",
    ".      the distribution @xmath19 does not give any information about the correlations between vertices .",
    "an obvious generalization is the joint distribution @xmath20 which describes the probability that a pair of nearest neighbors ( nns ) has degrees @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( we assume that we pick a pair of nns with uniform probability ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of links with their start point having degree @xmath21 and endpoint having degree @xmath22 .",
    "note that we treat each undirected link as two directed links . on an undirected graph , @xmath25",
    "if vertex degrees are independent , the probability should factorize : @xmath26 leading to the relation @xmath27 one should , however , keep in mind that this defines the absence of correlations in the _ ensemble _ of graphs . a more appropriate question",
    "could be , are the vertices on individual graphs uncorrelated ( see previous section ) ? the condition for absence of correlations between vertices in each individual graph @xmath7 is @xmath28 or , after averaging , @xmath29 as already pointed out , for a large class of ensembles conditions and are equivalent in the large - volume limit .",
    "however , it is easy to check that for the non - self - averaging ensemble in appendix  [ app : non - sa ] vertices on each individual graph are uncorrelated according to the condition , but correlated according to .",
    "again , we leave this as a warning and proceed further with the assumption that our models are self - averaging and that those two conditions are equivalent .    in practice ,",
    "checking the condition is difficult as it entails measuring a two dimensional distribution with good accuracy .",
    "therefore we introduce another quantity @xcite @xmath30 it describes the average degree of nearest neighbors of a vertex with degree @xmath11 .",
    "obviously @xmath31 is defined for a given @xmath11 only if @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath31 can be interpreted as the first moment of the conditional probability : @xmath33 assuming self - averaging , @xmath34 if the degrees are independent , @xmath31 should not depend on @xmath11 and implies @xmath35 when @xmath31 grows with @xmath11 the graph is called _ assortative _ and when it shrinks _ disassortative_.",
    "in general , maximally random graphs with a given degree distribution do not need to be connected .",
    "however , if @xmath36 ( which translates into @xmath37 in the case of er graphs ) , one of the connected components ( called the giant connected component ) will gather a finite fraction of all links and vertices @xcite .",
    "this is a phenomenon akin to percolation . in ref .",
    "@xcite the size of the giant component and the size distribution of finite components were calculated .",
    "the degree distribution in the giant component @xmath38 was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we generalize those results and calculate the two - point distributions @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the giant component .",
    "we will use the method of generating functions introduced in @xcite .",
    "the crucial observation is that the finite connected components are essentially trees .",
    "that is because a link emerging from one of the vertices in the component has the probability @xmath41 of connecting back to a node from this component , where @xmath42 is the size of the component .",
    "so for finite @xmath42 this becomes negligible in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "now let us pick a link from the graph at random .",
    "it belongs to some connected component .",
    "we will call @xmath43 the probability that cutting this link will split the component into two parts , one of them finite and having size @xmath42 . stated differently",
    ", @xmath43 is the probability that a randomly chosen link will lead into a finite part of size @xmath42 . by the argument above this finite `` half '' will be a tree .",
    "because of that , one can write down the equation for the generating function @xmath44 @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 we denote by @xmath47 the value of @xmath48 : @xmath49 when there is no giant component in the graph , all connected components are finite and are trees .",
    "this means that cutting each link will result in two finite parts ; thus , @xmath50 however , when the giant component appears , then there is a nonzero probability that the chosen link will belong to this component and either cutting it will split the component into two infinite parts , or will not split it at all .",
    "as this probability is missing from @xmath43 the sum will be smaller the one .",
    "@xmath47 is to be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen link is connected to a finite part on at least one side of the graph @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath51 is the probability that a random link belongs to a finite component of arbitrary size .",
    "that can be derived in a more explicit way .",
    "let us denote by @xmath52 the probability that a randomly chosen link belongs to a component of size @xmath42 . then , @xmath53 it is a _ convolution _ of the probability distribution @xmath43 with itself , so its generating function is just @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath55 is the probability that a link belongs to a finite connected component of arbitrary size and @xmath56 is the probability that it is inside the giant component .    finally , if we denote by @xmath57 the probability that a randomly chosen _",
    "vertex _ belongs to a finite component of size @xmath42 , we can obtain its generating function @xmath58 from @xmath59  @xcite : @xmath60 by the same arguments as above , @xmath61 is the probability that a randomly chosen vertex belongs to a finite connected component and @xmath62 is the probability that it belongs to the giant component",
    ".    it follows from and that @xmath47 is the solution of the equation @xmath63 from the definition it is easy to note that @xmath50 is always a solution , but when condition is fulfilled the above equation has a solution smaller than 1 as well @xcite .",
    "as argued , this signals the appearance of a giant component .      using the results of the previous section it is easy to derive formulas for the average degree in the giant component @xmath64 and in the rest of the graph @xmath65 :    @xmath66    as we have already pointed out ,",
    "the giant connected component is not a tree .",
    "the number of independent loops that it contains equals @xmath67 and as all the remaining connected components are trees , this is also the number of loops in the whole graph .",
    "we can also easily calculate the number of finite connected components @xmath68 knowing that they form a forest .",
    "the number of links in the forest is @xmath69 which gives @xmath70    from that we can derive the formula for the average size of the finite connected component : @xmath71      in this section we will calculate the degree distribution @xmath72 in the nongiant component part of the graph . from the relation @xmath73 we automatically get the distribution @xmath74 in the giant component .",
    "this has been already done in @xcite , but we find it instructive to use the same method of generating functions as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : connected ] .",
    "the idea is to apply it only to the graph with the giant component excluded ",
    ", to the finite connected components .",
    "we will use a tilde to denote the generating functions of the sought probability : @xmath75 using the argument from ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain the same equations    [ eq : htilde ] @xmath76    for the generating functions of the probabilities @xmath77 and @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath78 is the probability that a vertex belongs to a finite component of size @xmath42 provided that it belongs to a finite component and @xmath77 is the probability that a link leads into a finite component of size @xmath42 provided that it leads into a finite component . from this",
    "we can write the relations @xmath79 which leads to    [ eq : hht ] @xmath80    to solve eqs .  , , and for @xmath72 we make an ansatz @xmath81 then , @xmath82 so that eq .   can be rewritten as @xmath83 comparing with we see that it will be fulfilled if @xmath84 inserting this into we get @xmath85 because of eq .  , which can be solved by putting @xmath86 .",
    "now we must check eq .  .",
    "using eqs .  , ,",
    "and we get @xmath87 so finally , @xmath88 from that and relation we get the formula for the degree distribution in the giant component : @xmath89 in the limit @xmath90 and @xmath91 this reduces to @xmath92 in this limit the connected giant cluster is a tree .",
    "indeed , one can check that @xmath93 to see this we must first note that eq .   has always the solution @xmath50 .",

    "to check to what extent those assumptions are satisfied and , more importantly , to check the magnitude of the finite size effects , we have compared our predictions to the results of mc simulations of moderate - sized graphs ( 5000 vertices ) . to simulate er graphs we used a straightforward algorithm which connects vertices at random . to generate maximally random graphs with a given distribution we used the method described in refs .",

    "this method consists of generating graphs with suitably chosen one - point weights using a metropolis - type algorithm .",

    "@xcite and calculated correlations in the giant connected components of random graphs .",
    "we argue that those correlations are related to the presence of nodes with degree 1 , suggesting that the only cause of correlations is the absence of `` hedgehogs . ''",
    "this has been already stated in @xcite where it has been shown that in the grand - canonical ensemble of arbitrary - sized trees , where `` hedgehogs '' appear , correlations vanish .",
    "we find this to be a very interesting issue that merits further studies .",
    "the correlations observed in connected random graphs are an example of the so - called `` structural '' or `` kinematic '' correlations , as they appear in consequence of some global constraint .",
    "this should be contrasted with `` dynamic '' correlations which are the result of local two - point interactions between vertices .",
    "such correlations may be generated by two - point weights @xcite .",
    "this distinction can be important in simplicial quantum gravity where degree - degree correlations are interpreted as curvature - curvature correlations ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as the simplicial manifolds are connected by definition those correlations are due to the above described mechanism rather than to some kind of gravitational interaction @xcite .",
    "we believe that our results may help in clarifying such issues and in the interpretation of data obtained from mc simulations .",
    "finally , we have shown how to relate the giant connected components to the maximal entropy connected graphs ensemble .",
    "this allowed us to propose an efficient method for generating connected random graphs based on the metropolis algorithm .",

    "denoting by @xmath172 the ensemble of all simple regular graphs with @xmath0 vertices and degree @xmath11 ( in a regular graph all vertices have the same degree ) , we define @xmath173 where @xmath174 denotes the number of graphs in the ensemble @xmath172 and @xmath175 is an arbitrary probability distribution . with this definition",
    "we find @xmath176 it is easy to note that this poorly describes the distributions of single graphs which are just @xmath177 s .",
    "the variance of @xmath19 is @xmath178 and indeed does not disappear in the large-@xmath0 limit .    for correlations we obtain @xmath179 and @xmath180 so",
    "the condition is not satisfied .",
    "it means that vertices on each particular graph are uncorrelated , but correlated if the whole ensemble is considered .",
    "this is easy to explain : if we pick a link from a graph with a given @xmath11 , then the information about the first vertex does not provide any additional information ; however , if we do not know @xmath11 , then the degree of the first vertex will give us immediately the value of its neighbor .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 define a maximal entropy ensemble with @xmath0 vertices , @xmath1 links , and vertex degree distribution @xmath19 .",

    "we assume that we can neglect the fluctuations , so all the graphs in this ensemble have @xmath184 vertices and @xmath185 links .",
    "the degree distribution in this ensemble is @xmath74 .",
    "because of the property , the entropy of the whole ensemble @xmath186 is the sum of the entropy of the giant connected component ensemble and the rest : @xmath187 now we assume that there exists a probability @xmath188 defined on the ensemble @xmath183 such that the entropy @xmath189 is greater than @xmath190 , but the vertex degree probability distribution remains unchanged",
    ". then we can define a new probability on the ensemble @xmath2 : @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the giant connected component of graph @xmath7 .",
    "the degree distribution of the ensemble @xmath193 would be the same as that of @xmath186 ensemble , but according to , its entropy would be greater .",
    "this contradicts the assumption that @xmath186 is the maximal entropy ensemble and proves that the ensemble of giant connected components is a maximal entropy ensemble .",
