    "electromagnetic radiation provides the most important channel of information about our universe .",
    "valuable information about cosmic sources of photons , and about cosmic events accompanying the light propagation , is encoded in the intensity , polarization , phase and spectral characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation . in this sense ,",
    "reconstruction of the phase and group velocities of observed electromagnetic waves , which travel through plasma and gas in the dark matter environment , gives us the basis for theoretical modeling of the properties of these cosmic substrates .",
    "when we deal with plasma , the phase and group velocities are given by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , where @xmath2 is the frequency and @xmath3 is the wave three - vector modulus .",
    "thus , the dependence @xmath4 obtained from the so - called _ dispersion relations _ for the longitudinal and transversal electromagnetic waves in plasma plays an important role in the information decryption .",
    "the theory of dispersion relations is well - elaborated for various plasma configurations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details , review and references ) . to obtain novel results in this scientific sphere",
    "we intend to use a new nonminimal einstein - maxwell - vlasov - axion model @xcite , which deals with the self - consistent theory of tidal - type interactions between gravitational , electromagnetic , pseudoscalar ( axion ) fields and a relativistic multi - component plasma .",
    "cosmological applications of this model seem to be the most interesting , since the study of the interaction of four key players of the nonminimal einstein - maxwell - vlasov - axion model ( gravitons , photons , electrically charged plasma particles and axions ) is important for the description of the history of our universe .",
    "there are at least three motives , which could explain this interest .",
    "first , in the early universe the nonminimal couping of a matter and fields to gravity was important on the stage of inflation , when the space - time curvature was varying catastrophically fast .",
    "late - time accelerated expansion discovered recently @xcite has revived an interest to inertial , tidal and rip s effects @xcite , for which the curvature coupling could be also important .",
    "second , the cold dark matter , which now is considered to be one of two key elements of the dark fluid , guiding the late - time universe evolution @xcite , contains ( hypothetically ) an axion subsystem . in the early universe the axions ( light pseudo - goldstone bosons ) could be created due to the phase transition associated with the peccei - quinn symmetry breakdown @xcite . in the late - time universe",
    "these pseudo - bosons , probably , exist as relic axions , forming various cold dark matter configurations .",
    "third , electrically charged plasma and photons are ubiquitous : one can find plasma configurations and an ocean of photons in every epoch in the cosmic history and in many objects , which form our universe .",
    "of course , studying the nonminimal einstein - maxwell - vlasov - axion theory , we are restricted to theoretical modeling of the dispersion relations for relativistic homogeneous axionically active plasma .",
    "for instance , plasma can be treated as relativistic substratum in the early universe ; however , as was shown in the papers @xcite , the peccei - quinn phase transition is accompanied by the creation of strongly inhomogeneous axionic primordial configurations , which were indicated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) as `` archioles '' .",
    "the inhomogeneity of archioles type is frozen at the radiation domination stage and should be inherited in the large scale structure of the modern universe . additional problem in the theoretical modeling",
    "is connected with instabilities generated in plasma due to its inhomogeneity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "self - gravitation of the pseudoscalar ( axion ) field produces gravitational instability similarly to the instability of scalar fields described in @xcite , thus making the studying of the electromagnetic waves propagation much more sophisticated .",
    "in such situation we need of some toy - model , which provides a balance between complexity of the problem as a whole and mathematical clarity of the simplified model . for the first step we have chosen the approximation , which is standard for homogeneous cosmological model : the space - time metric and the axionic dark matter distribution",
    "are considered to depend on time only . in this case",
    "the standard approach to the analysis of waves propagation in relativistic plasma is based on the study of dispersion relations in terms of frequency @xmath2 and wave three - vector @xmath5 .",
    "when we consider homogeneous cosmological models , we can use the standard fourier transformations with respect to spatial coordinates and can naturally introduce the analog of @xmath5 .",
    "the fourier - laplace transformation with respect to time is , generally , non - effective , since the coefficients in the master equations for the electromagnetic field depend on cosmological time .",
    "however , we have found one specific very illustrative model ( the plasma is ultrarelativistic , the spacetime is of a constant curvature , the axion field has a constant time derivative ) , for which the master equations can be effectively transformed into a set of differential equations with constant coefficients .",
    "this simplified the analysis of the dispersion relations essentially , and allowed us to interpret the results in the standard terms .",
    "as a next step , we plan to consider homogeneous but anisotropic models , and then models with inhomogeneous distribution of the axionic dark matter .",
    "in this work we obtain and analyze the dispersion relations for perturbations in the axionically active plasma , non - minimally coupled to gravity , classify these perturbations and distinguish the transversal waves , which can propagate with the phase velocity less than the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the appropriate background state of the system as a whole , and discuss the exact solutions of non - perturbed master equations for the plasma in the gravitational and axionic fields , which were derived in @xcite . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we consider the equations for the electromagnetic perturbations in the @xmath6 form and then the equations for the corresponding fourier - laplace images in the @xmath7 form .",
    "we analyze in detail the dispersion relations for longitudinal waves in section  [ sec4 ] , and for transversal waves in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "we summarize the results in section  [ sec6 ] ( discussion ) .",
    "let us consider the _ background _ solutions for the nonminimal einstein - maxwell - vlasov - axion model , which satisfy the following four conditions . _ first _ , we assume that the spacetime is isotropic , spatially homogeneous and is described by the metric @xmath8 \\ , .",
    "\\label{m0}\\ ] ] _ second _ , we suppose that the pseudoscalar field inherits the spacetime symmetry and depends on time only , @xmath9 .",
    "_ third _ , we assume , that both the background macroscopic ( external ) and cooperative ( internal ) electromagnetic fields are absent , i.e. , the total maxwell tensor is equal to zero @xmath10 .",
    "_ fourth _ , we consider the plasma to be the test ingredient of the cosmological model ; this means that the contribution of the plasma particles into the total stress - energy tensor is negligible in comparison with the dark energy contribution , presented in our model by the @xmath11 term , and with the dark matter one , described by the axion field @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is dimensionless pseudoscalar field ) .",
    "these four requirements provide the master equations obtained in @xcite to be reduced to the following system .      in the absence of the electromagnetic field",

    "<S> we focus on dispersion relations for electromagnetic perturbations in an initially isotropic ultrarelativistic plasma coupled to the gravitational and axion fields in the framework of isotropic homogeneous cosmological model of the de sitter type . </S>",
    "<S> we classify the longitudinal and transversal electromagnetic modes in an axionically active plasma and distinguish between waves ( damping , instable or running ) , and nonharmonic perturbations ( damping or instable ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for the special choice of the guiding model parameters the transversal electromagnetic waves in the axionically active plasma , nonminimally coupled to gravity , can propagate with the phase velocity less than speed of light in vacuum , thus displaying a possibility for a new type of resonant particle - wave interactions . </S>"
