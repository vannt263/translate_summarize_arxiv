    "the sample with the diameter @xmath24 60  mm was grown on a silicon substrate that was chemically etched after deposition  @xcite .",
    "the main impurities in the sample were hydrogen ( @xmath2470  ppm ) and nitrogen ( @xmath241.5  ppm ) .",
    "other impurities were less than 0.1  ppm . the cylinder - shaped sample d6 with the diameter 25  mm and height 1.3  mm ( thickness 0.427  g/@xmath25 ) for the @xmath18sr study , and two bricks ( samples a and b ) with the dimensions 3x1.5x1.5 mm@xmath26 ( weight 34  mg ) for magnetic measurements were cut using a laser . in the @xmath18sr experiment 85% of the incoming muons stopped in the sample and 15% in the copper holder .",

    "the muon polarization @xmath32 in the 1s state of copper is close to zero due to the hyperfine interaction of the muon spin with the spin of the nucleus and due to very fast transitions between the levels @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the spin of the copper nucleus and @xmath41 is the muon spin ( see @xcite ) .",

[ d6-alc - data ] ) and as @xmath48 in the range of @xmath49  k ( dotted line ) . a strong drop of the damping rate at @xmath50  k and no damping at 300 and 330  k were observed .",
    "there is no difference in the damping rate of the muon spin at 140  k in the magnetic field of 3.0  koe compared to 14  koe .",

    "opposite to the theoretical prediction  @xcite and to the experimental results in silicon  @xcite , a negative shift of the muon spin precession frequency was observed at temperatures below 250  k. the temperature dependence of the frequency shift can be approximated as @xmath53/\\omega(300~{\\rm k } ) = \\delta\\omega/\\omega \\sim -1/t$ ] ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ d6-alc - data ] ) .",
    "the negative shift of the muon spin precession frequency may be due to three different reasons :    \\a ) it may be due to the presence of other paramagnetic defects ( excluding the acceptor centres ) in diamond . the magnetic field at the muon could differ from the external field because of polarization of these paramagnetic defects .",
    "for example , n@xmath54 and h1(h2 ) paramagnetic centres were observed in polycrystalline cvd diamond by epr  @xcite ;    \\b ) let us assume that the muonic atom is formed in the @xmath55b@xmath54 state within a time less than 10@xmath56  s and that the transition rate from this state to the equilibrium one ( @xmath55b@xmath57+h ) is smaller than the muon decay rate . in the state @xmath55b@xmath54 the muonic atom has covalent chemical bonds with three nearest carbon atoms , and the fourth carbon atom has an electron with an unpaired spin ( one dangling bond ) .",
    "the polarization of this paramagnetic complex in an external magnetic field could result in the negative shift of the muon spin precession frequency ;    \\c ) negative frequency shift can also be due to polarization of the paramagnetic acceptor centre in the magnetic field if the muonic atom is formed in the ( @xmath55b@xmath57+h ) state in @xmath58  s and the hyperfine interaction in the ac is anisotropic . in the state ( @xmath55b@xmath57+h )",
    "the muonic atom has covalent chemical bonds with all four nearest carbon atoms and a hole localized in the vicinity of ac",
    ".    the frequency shift of the muon spin precession should be proportional to the susceptibility of the paramagnetic defects or to the susceptibility of the paramagnetic acceptor centres if @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , a simple @xmath60 ( curie type ) temperature dependence of the muon spin precession frequency shift is expected .",
    "to elucidate the effect of paramagnetic ( magnetic ) defects on the muon spin precession frequency we measured the magnetic susceptibility of our sample .",
    "the magnetic moments ( @xmath61 ) of samples a and b were measured in magnetic fields in the range of @xmath62  koe at the temperatures 20 , 100 , and 300  k. the temperature dependence @xmath63 was studied in detail in the magnetic fields of 95.2  oe and 20.0  koe for both samples .",
    "the dc magnetization measurements were performed with the quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "the results for both samples a and b are similar within the accuracy of the measurements",
    ". the results of the measurements for sample a are presented in fig .",
    "[ squid1 ] and in fig .",
    "[ squid2 ] .",
    "there is evident linear dependence of the magnetic moment on the magnetic field in the range from 0 to 50.0 koe .",
    "the susceptibility of the sample was @xmath64  cm@xmath26/g , @xmath66  cm@xmath26/g , and @xmath67  cm@xmath26/g , at the temperatures 20 , 100 , and 300 k , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath68 for the synthetic cvd sample is in agreement with that for natural diamond  @xcite . as seen from fig .",
    "[ squid2 ] , the magnetic moment of the sample in the 95.2 oe and 20.0  koe magnetic field practically does not depend on temperature in the range of @xmath69  k. only at temperatures below 20  k the magnetic moment slightly increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "therefore , the concentration of magnetic impurities ( defects ) in our cvd sample is negligible and can not produce the observed frequency shift .",
    "moreover , the muon spin precession frequency shift depends on temperature as @xmath70 in the range of @xmath69  k , where the magnetic moment of the sample is practically constant .",
    "the measured values of @xmath32 at different @xmath71 are close to the maximum possible muon polarization in the 1s state of a carbon atom .",
    "this means that the muonic atom @xmath55b is formed in one of the chemically bonded @xmath55b@xmath54 or ( @xmath55b@xmath72 + h ) states with a probability close to unity in less than @xmath73  s. it is worth mentioning that the auger transitions of the muon destroy chemical bonds of the muonic atom with neighbouring carbon atoms .",
    "theoretical calculations  @xcite suggest that the muonic atom in diamond restores chemical bonds and is formed in the @xmath55b@xmath54 state within @xmath74  s.    at present we do not have an analytical expression for the relaxation of the muon spin if there is an anisotropic hyperfine interaction in the muonic atom .",
    "nevertheless , we may assume that @xmath34 is inversely proportional to the relaxation rate of the magnetic moment of the acceptor centre in both @xmath55b@xmath54 and ( @xmath55b@xmath72 + h ) states . in diamond relaxation of the magnetic moments of @xmath55b@xmath54 and ( @xmath55b@xmath57 + h )",
    "should be attributed to scattering of phonons by these centres .",
    "direct , raman , and orbach processes can contribute to phonon scattering , and the temperature dependence of the probability of these processes is very different  @xcite . in the present experiment two temperature domains with different temperature dependences of the relaxation rate of the muon spin were observed .",
    "thus , we conclude that there is a contribution of two different processes to scattering of phonons at the acceptor in diamond .",
    "the dominance of one process over the other reverses at about 80  k. according to the calculations for the acceptor in silicon , the raman process overcomes the direct ( one phonon ) process at @xmath75 k , and the orbach process is negligible below 100  k @xcite .     at the magnetic field of 20.0  koe was scaled by 1/210 ]",
    "a large negative shift of the precession frequency of the negative muon spin in diamond was found for the first time .",
    "simple curie type @xmath76 temperature dependence of the frequency shift was observed .",
    "it is not excluded that the muonic atom as an ac forms in the equilibrium ( @xmath55b@xmath57 + h ) state in @xmath77  s and there is an anisotropic hyperfine interaction in ac .",
    "the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate of the muon spin evidences that two different processes contribute to phonon scattering by the acceptor centre in the temperature range of @xmath78  k."
