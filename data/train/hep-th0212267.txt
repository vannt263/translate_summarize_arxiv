    "[ [ section ] ]    nambu @xcite introduced an elegant generalization of the classical hamiltonian formalism by suggesting to supplant the poisson bracket ( pb ) with a @xmath0- or @xmath1-linear , fully antisymmetric bracket , the classical nambu bracket ( cnb ) , a volume - element jacobian determinant in a higher dimensional space .",
    "this bracket , involving a dynamical quantity and two or more hamiltonians , provides the time - evolution of that quantity in a generalization of hamilton s equations of motion for selected physical systems .",
    "it was gradually realized @xcite that nambu brackets in phase space describe the generic classical evolution of all systems with sufficiently many independent integrals of motion beyond those required for complete integrability of the systems .",
    "that is to say , all such superintegrable systems  @xcite  are automatically described by nambu s mechanics @xcite , whether one chooses to take cognizance of this alternate expression of their time development or not .",
    "this approach to time evolution for superintegrable systems is supplementary to the standard hamiltonian dynamics evolution and provides additional tools for analyzing such systems .",
    "the power of nambu s method is evident in a manifest and simultaneous accounting of a maximal number of the symmetries of these systems , and in an efficient application of algebraic methods to yield results even without detailed knowledge of their specific dynamics .    as a bonus ,",
    "the classical volume - preserving features of nambu brackets suggest that they are useful for membrane theory @xcite .",
    "there are in the literature several persuasive but inconclusive arguments that nambu brackets are a natural language for describing extended objects , for example : @xcite .    in his original paper @xcite ,",
    "nambu also introduced operator versions of his brackets as tools to implement the quantization of his approach to mechanics .",
    "he enumerated various logical possibilities involving them , arguing that some structures were either inconsistent or uninteresting , but he did not advocate the position that the remaining possibilities were untenable :  quantization was left as an open issue .",
    "unfortunately , subsequent unwarranted insistence on algebraic structures ill - suited to the solution of the relevant physics problems resulted in a widely held belief that quantization of nambu mechanics was problematic , especially when that quantization was formulated as a one - parameter deformation of classical structures .",
    "in marked contrast to this prevailing pessimism , several illustrative superintegrable systems were quantized in @xcite in a phase - space framework , both without and _ with _ the construction of quantum nambu brackets ( qnbs ) .",
    "however , the phase - space quantization utilized there , while most appropriate for comparing quantum expressions with their classical limits , is still unfamiliar to many readers and will not be used in this paper .  here , the quantization of all systems will be carried out in a conventional hilbert space operator formalism .",
    "it turns out @xcite that all perceived difficulties in quantizing nambu mechanics may be traced mathematically to the algebraic inconsistencies inherent in selecting constraints in a top - down approach , with little regard to the correct phase - space structure which already provides full and consistent answers , and with insufficient attention towards obtaining specific answers compatible with those produced in the quantized hamiltonian description of these systems .",
    "moreover , the physics underlying these perceived difficulties is simple , and involves only basic principles in quantum mechanics .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    some physicists might hold , without realizing it , the prejudice that continuous time evolution in quantum mechanics must always be formulated infinitesimally as a derivation .",
    "accordingly , they implicitly _ assume _ the instantaneous temporal change in all dynamical variables is always given by nothing but a simple derivative , so that for all products of linear operators@xmath2 this assumption allows time development on physical hilbert spaces to be expressed algebraically in terms of commutators with a hamiltonian , since commutators are also derivations.@xmath3   = \\left [   h , a\\right ]   b+a\\left [   h , b\\right ]   \\;.\\ ] ] evidently this approach leads to the simplest possible formalism .",
    "but is it really necessary to make this assumption and follow this approach ?",
    "it is not .",
    "time evolution can also be expressed algebraically using quantum nambu brackets .",
    "these quantum brackets are defined as totally antisymmetrized multi - linear products of any number of linear operators acting on hilbert space .",
    "when qnbs are used to implement time evolution in quantum mechanics , the result is usually _ not _ a derivation , but contains derivations entwined within more elaborate structures ( although there are some interesting special exceptions that are described in the following ) .",
    "this more general point of view towards time development can be arrived at just by realizing a physical idea . when a system has a number of conserved quantities , it is possible to partition the system s hilbert space into invariant sectors .",
    "time evolution on those various sectors may then be formulated using different time scales for the different sectors  the resulting expression of instantaneous changes in time is then not a derivation , in general , when acting on the full hilbert space , and therefore is not given by a simple commutator .",
    "remarkably , however , it often turns out to be given compactly in terms of qnbs .",
    "conversely , if qnbs are used to describe time development , they usually impose different time scales on different invariant sectors of a system @xcite .    nevertheless , so long as the different time scales are implemented in such a way as to produce evolving phase differences between nondegenerate energy eigenstates , there is no loss of information in this more general approach to time evolution .  in the classical limit , this method is not really different from the usual hamiltonian approach .",
    "a given classical trajectory has fixed values for all invariants , and hence would have a fixed time scale in nambu mechanics .",
    "time development of any dynamical quantity along a single classical trajectory would therefore always be just a derivation , with no possibility of mixing time scales .",
    "quantum mechanics , on the other hand , is more subtle , since the preparation of a state may yield a superposition of components from different invariant sectors .",
    "such superpositions will , in general , involve multiple time scales in nambu mechanics .    technically , the various time scales arise in quantum nambu mechanics as the entwined eigenvalues of generalized jordan spectral problems , where selected invariants of the model in question appear as operators in the spectral equation .",
    "the resulting structure represents a new class of eigenvalue problems for mathematical physics .",
    "fortunately , solutions of this new class can be found using traditional methods .",
    "( all this is explained explicitly in the context of the first example of  3.2 . )",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    algebras which involve multi - linear products have also been considered at various times in the mathematical literature , partly as efforts to understand or generalize jordan algebras @xcite ( cf . especially the `` associator '' ) , but more generally following higgins study in the mid-1950s @xcite .",
    "this eventually culminated in the investigations of certain cohomology questions , by schlesinger and stasheff @xcite , by hanlon and wachs @xcite , and by azcrraga , izquierdo , perelomov , and prez bueno @xcite , that led to results most relevant to nambu s work .",

    ", we describe the most important features of classical nambu brackets ,  2.2 , with emphasis on practical , algebraic , evaluation methods .",
    "we delve into several examples ,  2.3 , to gain physical insight for the classical theory .",
    "we then give a parallel discussion of the quantum theory , ",
    "3.1 , so far as algebraic features and methods of evaluation are concerned .",
    "we define qnbs , as well as generalized jordan products ( gjps ) that naturally arise in conjunction with qnbs , when the latter are resolved into products of commutators .",
    "we define derivators as measures of the failure of the leibniz rule for qnbs , and discuss jacobi and fundamental identities in a quantum setting",
    ".  then we again turn to various examples ,  3.2 , to illustrate both the elegance and peculiarities of quantization .",
    "we deal with essentially the same examples in both classical and quantum frameworks , as a means of emphasizing the similarities and , more importantly , delineating the differences between cnbs and qnbs .",
    "the examples chosen are all models based on lie symmetry algebras :  @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our results , and by suggesting some topics for further study .",
    "an appendix discusses the formal solution of linear equations in lie and jordan algebras , with suggestions for techniques to bypass the effects of divisors of zero .",
    "a hurried reader may wish to consider only  2.1 ,  2.2 through eqn([2n=2+(2n-2 ) ] ) ,  2.3 through eqn([anylie4cnb ] ) ,  3.1 through eqn([mapsto ] ) , and  3.2 through eqn([da / dtanylie ] ) .",
    "this abridged material contains our main points .",
    "we begin with a brief geometrical discussion of phase - space dynamics , to motivate the definition of classical nambu brackets .",
    "we then describe properties of cnbs , with emphasis on practical evaluation methods , including various recursion relations among the brackets and simplifications that result from classical lie symmetries being imposed on the entries in the bracket .",

    "a superintegrable system in phase space _ can _ _ hardly _ _ avoid _ having its classical evolution described by cnbs @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    for a system with @xmath13 degrees of freedom , and hence a @xmath18-dimensional phase - space , we define the maximal classical nambu bracket ( cnb ) of rank @xmath18 to be the determinant@xmath24 this bracket is linear in its arguments , and completely antisymmetric in them",
    ".  it may be thought of as the jacobian induced by transforming to new phase space variables @xmath25 , the elements  in the bracket .  as expected for such a jacobian , two functionally dependent elements cause the bracket to collapse to zero .",
    "so , in particular , adding to any element an arbitrary linear combination of the other elements will not change the value of the bracket .",
    "odd dimensional brackets are also defined identically @xcite , in an odd - dimensional space .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    the simplest of these are immediate consequences of the properties of the totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbols.@xmath26 however , these @xmath27 resolutions are not especially germane to a phase - space discussion , since they reduce even brackets into products of odd brackets .    more usefully , any maximal even rank cnb can also be resolved into products of poisson brackets .",
    "for example , for systems with two degrees of freedom , @xmath28 , and the 4-bracket @xmath29 resolves as@xmath30 in comportance with full antisymmetry under permutations of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .  the general result for maximal rank @xmath18 brackets for systems with a @xmath18-dimensional phase - space is@xmath33 where @xmath34 with @xmath35  the parity of the permutation @xmath36 .",

    "these must first be defined .",
    "it is easiest to just _ define _ sub - maximal even rank cnbs by their poisson bracket resolutions as in ( [ 2nbracketaspbs])-brackets presented and discussed in @xcite , from which the same poisson bracket resolutions follow as a consequence of taking the classical limit of @xmath43-commutator resolutions of even @xmath43-brackets .",
    "it is also consistent with taking symplectic traces of maximal cnbs , again as presented in @xcite ( see ( [ symplectictrace ] ) to follow).]:@xmath44 only here we allow @xmath45 .",
    "so defined , these sub - maximal cnbs enter in further recursive expressions .",
    "for example , for systems with three or more degrees of freedom , @xmath46 , and a general 6-bracket expression resolves as @xmath47 with the 4-brackets resolvable into pbs as in ( [ 4bracketaspbs ] ) .",
    "this permits the building - up of higher even rank brackets proceeding from initial pbs involving all degrees of freedom .",
    "the general recursion relation with this @xmath48 form is@xmath49 and features @xmath50 terms on the rhs .",
    "this recursive result is equivalent to taking ( [ 2nbracketaspbs ] ) as a definition for @xmath51 elements , as can be seen by substituting the pb resolutions of the @xmath52-brackets on the rhs of ( [ 2n=2+(2n-2 ) ] ) .",
    "similar relations obtain  when the @xmath53 elements in the cnb are partitioned into sets of @xmath54 and @xmath55 elements , with suitable antisymmetrization with respect to exchanges between the two sets .",
    "these results may be extended beyond maximal cnbs to super - maximal brackets , in a useful way .",
    "all such super - maximal classical brackets vanish , for the simple reason that there are not enough independent partial derivatives to avoid repeating columns of the implicit matrix whose determinant is under consideration .",
    "another way to say this is as the impossibility to antisymmetrize more than @xmath18 coordinate and momentum indices in @xmath18-dimensional phase space , so for any phase - space function @xmath56 , we have @xmath57}v\\equiv0\\;,$ ] with @xmath58 ( odd ) @xmath59  consequently , @xmath60}v=0 $ ] , for any @xmath18 phase - space functions @xmath61 , @xmath62 and any @xmath56 , a result that may be thought of as the vanishing of the @xmath63-th super - maximal cnb .  as a further consequence , we have on @xmath18-dimensional phase spaces other super - maximal identities of the form @xmath64 for any choice of @xmath56 , @xmath65 , @xmath40s , and @xmath66s .",

    "also apply to the super - maximal case as well , where they provide vanishing theorems for the sums on the rhss of those relations .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    when the phase - space functions involved in a classical bracket obey a poisson bracket algebra ( possibly even an infinite one ) , the nb reduces to become a sum of products , each product involving half as many phase - space functions ( _ reductio ad dimidium _ ) .",
    "it follows as an elementary consequence of the pb resolution of even cnbs . for any pb lie algebra given by@xmath67",
    "the pb resolution then gives ( sum over all repeated @xmath68s  is to be understood)@xmath69 where @xmath40 is arbitrary .  of course",

    "the quantum bracket in ( [ 4qnbentwinedderivation ] ) has a kernel , just as its classical limit does , but the quantum case evinces the linear superpositions inherent in quantum mechanics .",
    "this is evident in ( [ jordantimescales ] ) , where a given eigenoperator is left unchanged by the bracket if @xmath409 , rather than simply @xmath410 .",

    "if @xmath56 is a function of the invariants , manipulation of the classical expression may be useful , to result in a simpler @xmath56 , and in new cnb entries which would still combine into the hamiltonian in the pb resolution .",
    "the corresponding qnb would then be expected to yield the entwined structures to be studied as above , with the hamiltonian appearing as an entwined commutator ( time derivative ) , and with the respective time scale eigenvalue problems to be solved .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated and illustrated through simple , explicit examples , how nambu brackets provide a consistent , elegant description , both classically and quantum mechanically , especially of superintegrable systems using even qnbs .",
    "this description can be equivalent to classical and quantum hamiltonian mechanics , but it is broader in its conceptualizations and may have more possible uses .",
    "in particular , we have explained in detail how qnbs are consistent , after all , given due consideration to multiple time scales set by invariants entwining the time derivatives , and how reputed inconsistencies have instead involved unsuitable and untenable conditions .  we have also emphasized additional complications that distinguish odd qnbs .",
    "we believe the physical interpretations of entwined time derivatives , with their dynamical time scales , and group rotations , in the general situation , explain the perceived failure of the classical leibniz rules and the classical fi in a transparent way , and are the only ingredients required for a successful non - abelian quantum implementation of the most general nambu brackets as descriptions of dynamics .",
    "perhaps this approach is equivalent to the abelian deformation approach @xcite , but that has not been shown .",
    "however , ultimately it should not be necessary to have to argue , physically , that if the abelian deformation approach to quantization of nambu brackets is indeed logically complete and consistent , then it must give specific results equivalent to the more traditional noncommutative operator approach given here .",
    "there is , after all , not very much freedom in the quantization of free particles and simple harmonic oscillators !",
    "moreover , hanlon and wachs @xcite announced the result that even qnb algebras ( designated by them as `` lie @xmath65-algebras '' ) are `` koszul '' ( also see @xcite ) , and therefore have duals which are commutative and totally associative .",
    "is it possible that the abelian deformation quantization of nambu brackets is precisely this dual , and is in that sense equivalent mathematically to the non - abelian structures we have discussed ?",
    "other such mathematical issues and areas for further study are raised by our analysis , such as :  a complete mathematical classification of jordan - kurosh eigenvalue problems ; a corresponding treatment of quantum rotation terms ; a study of both classical and quantum topological effects in terms of nambu brackets ; and the behavior of the brackets in the large n limit ( as one way to obtain a field theory ) .",
    "there are also several open avenues for physical applications , the most promising involving membranes and other extended objects .  in that regard ,",
    "given the quantum dichotomy of even and odd brackets , it would appear that extended objects with alternate - dimensional world - volumes are more amenable to qnbs .",
    "while volume preserving diffeomorphisms are based on classical geometrical concepts , perhaps relying too strongly on associativity , their ultimate generalization to noncommutative geometries , and their uses in field , string , and membrane theories , should be possible .",
    "we hope the developments in this paper contribute towards completion of such enterprises .",
    "we thank y nambu and y nutku for helpful discussions , and j de azcrraga for pointing out related earlier work , as well as a critical reading of the manuscript .",

    "again , the series gives an ill - defined result,@xmath608 .",
    "this shows clearly that convergence is again a problem .  as before ,",
    "the proper way to interpret the sum in this particular example is @xmath609 , to produce the obvious solution to the original equation , @xmath610     the failed convergence for these series is accompanied by a basic problem :  divisors of zero .",
    "even when @xmath576 is invertible in the enveloping algebra , so that the only solution of @xmath611 is @xmath612 , this does _ not _ hold for the jordan or lie products .",
    "the lie case is most familiar and easily seen .",
    "@xmath613 always has an infinite number of nonvanishing solutions @xmath614 .",
    "namely , @xmath615 for any parameter @xmath616 .  moreover , there can  and will be other independent solutions for higher dimensional enveloping algebras .",
    "that is to say , lie algebras are not division rings , even when they only involve commutators of invertible elements from @xmath287 .",
    "the same is true for the jordan case , in general .",
    "for instance , using the @xmath603 matrices as an example , again with @xmath617 , we have @xmath618for@xmath619 for any parameters @xmath620 and @xmath408 .",
    "so , as stressed already , special jordan algebras are not division rings  not even when they involve only anticommutators of invertible elements from @xmath287 .",
    "perhaps one way to avoid these difficulties and place the formal series constructions on a firmer footing would be through regularizing _",
    "deformations _ of the algebras .",
    "this works for the specific jordan or lie examples above , as illustrations of the method .  rather than the jordan or lie products ,",
    "take @xmath621 .",
    "( this deformation was actually analyzed in jordan s original paper @xcite , before he settled on the @xmath622 case . )",

    "thus@xmath626 for the simplest situation where @xmath589 , this gives @xmath627 now the correct result emerges in the limit @xmath628 , but strictly speaking this is _ not _ within the radius of convergence of the series .",
    "the series must first be summed to obtain a meromorphic function , by analytic continuation , and the limit applied to that function .",
    "the same method works for the simple lie example given above .  again , suppose @xmath604 and let @xmath605 .",
    "the series for the right inverse now gives @xmath629 .",
