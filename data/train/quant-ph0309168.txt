    "this in turn decreases the degree of localization @xmath34 which reduces the phase shift .",
    "as we will see in the following , in a certain parameter range this dynamics provides more than one steady  state , thus giving rise to bistability phenomena .",

    "we servo lock the laser frequency to one of the counterpropagating travelling waves ( say the ( + ) mode ) with a technique discussed in detail in [ stabilization ] . here",
    "we merely account for the fact that this servo acts to maintain the complex field amplitude @xmath52 at a constant value , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
