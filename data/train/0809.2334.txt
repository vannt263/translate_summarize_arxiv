    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are brief and intense flares of @xmath0-rays . without precedent in astronomy , they arrive from random directions in the sky and last typically  @xmath40.1100  s  ( _ prompt _ emission , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the very nature of grbs makes it operationally rather challenging to study their _ prompt _ phase simultaneously in any other wavelength .",
    "the observed grb properties are generally well explained by the _ fireball _ model , in which the emission is produced in relativistic shocks  @xcite . in this standard model , the highly - relativistic plasma , which emits the observed sub - mev radiation , is expected to generate @xmath0-rays up to the very - high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath5100  gev ) regime , via inverse - compton emission of electrons or proton - induced mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of gamma - rays or sufficiently sensitive upper limits would shed light on our understanding of the current model .",
    "some important yet largely unknown parameters in grb models , such as the bulk lorentz factor and the opacity of the outflow just after the acceleration phase , can be directly measured through high - energy ( he ; @xmath6100 mev ) and vhe @xmath0-ray observations during the _ prompt _ phase of grbs  @xcite .",
    "there are two techniques used in vhe @xmath0-ray astronomy to observe the _ prompt _ phase : the first technique is to slew quickly to the grb position provided by a burst alert from satellites . this technique is used for imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , such as the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) , which have a field of view ( fov ) of a few degrees .",
    "the magic telescope , operating in this mode , was able to slew to the position of grb  050713a , 40  s after the grb onset , while the _ prompt _ kev emission was still active .",
    "a total of 37 minutes of observations were made and no evidence of emission above 175  gev was obtained  @xcite .",
    "the rapid follow - up observations using this telescope of 8 other grbs show no evidence of vhe @xmath0-ray emission from these grbs during the _ prompt _ or the _ early afterglow _",
    "phase  @xcite .",
    "however , there is always a delay in time for iacts operating in this grb - follow - up mode , as long as the grb position lies outside the camera fov at the onset of the grb .",
    "this results in an incomplete coverage of the grb _ prompt _ phase .",
    "the second technique is to observe a large part of the sky continuously , at the expense of much lower sensitivity than the iact detectors .",
    "this technique is used , e.g. for the water cherenkov detector milagro , which works at higher energies than current iacts . since the effect of extra - galactic background light ( ebl ) absorption increases with the energy of a @xmath0-ray photon",
    ", the higher energy threshold of milagro thus lowers its chance to detect vhe @xmath0-rays from distant grbs , when compared to iact detectors .",
    "no evidence of vhe @xmath0-ray emission was seen from 39 grbs using this detector  @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a possible vhe @xmath0-ray enhancement coincident with grb  970417a ( with a post - trials probability @xmath7 of being a background fluctuation ) using milagrito , the forerunner of milagro .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the first completely simultaneous observation with an iact instrument of a @xmath0-ray burst ( grb  060602b ) using h.e.s.s .",

    "at 23:54:33.9 ut on 2006 june 2 ( denoted by @xmath8 ) , the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on board _ swift _ , which operates in the @xmath9 kev energy band , triggered on grb  060602b  ( trigger 213190 , * ? ? ?",

    "a total of 4.9 hours of observations were obtained during the night of 2006 june 23 .",
    "this includes 1.7  hour _ pre - burst _ ,",
    "9  s _ prompt _ , and 3.2  hour _ afterglow _ phases .",
    "additionally , 4.7 hours of observations at the burst position were obtained over the next 3 nights .",
    "all data were taken in good weather conditions and with good hardware status .",
    "the observations were taken with the grb  060602b position placed at different offsets relative to the center of the fov of the telescopes , because most observations were not dedicated to the position of grb  060602b .",
    "the position offsets were rather large ( @xmath43 ) during the period before the burst until @xmath49  minutes after the burst .    due to the h.e.s.s .",

    "calibration of data , event reconstruction and rejection of the cosmic - ray background ( i.e. @xmath0-ray event selection criteria ) were performed as described in  @xcite , which employ the techniques described by  @xcite .",
    "targets are typically observed at a _ normal _ offset from the fov center of 0.5@xmath42 or 0.7@xmath42 ( _ wobble _ mode ) , to allow for a simultaneous background estimate from regions in the fov that have identical properties as the source position . at _",
    "normal _ offsets , the point spread function ( psf ) and effective area for @xmath0-rays are nearly identical to the values at the fov center , according to air - shower simulations . however , the reconstructed event directions are less accurate at larger offsets .",

    "figure  [ eff_area ] shows the effective areas for various photon energies at offsets from 0@xmath42 to 3@xmath42 from the center of the fov for z.a.@xmath44 , using the standard cut analysis described below .",
    "gamma - like events were then taken from a circular region of radius @xmath45 centered at the burst position .",
    "the background was estimated using the reflected - region background model as described in  @xcite .",
    "two sets of analysis cuts were applied to search for a vhe @xmath0-ray signal .",
    "these include standard cuts  @xcite and soft cuts ( with lower energy thresholds , as described in  @xcite ) .",
    "standard cuts are optimized for a source with a photon index of @xmath46 .",
    "soft cuts are optimized for sources with steep spectra ( @xmath47 ) , thus having a better sensitivity at lower energies .",
    "the latter is useful for a source at cosmological distances , since the ebl absorption would greatly soften the intrinsic spectrum of the vhe @xmath0-ray radiation from the source . for observational periods with a position offset of @xmath48 , a larger @xmath45 value of @xmath49 was used to accommodate the larger psf",

    "hence , only the analysis results based on hillas parameters are presented in this paper .",
    "no evidence for excess @xmath0-ray events was found at any time before , during , or after the event grb  060602b .",
    "crab - like _ photon spectral index of 2.6 is assumed when deriving the flux limits presented in this section .",

    "the limits for the period @xmath56 after the burst are at levels comparable to the x - ray energy flux as observed by _",
    "swift_/xrt during the same period .",
    "these limits are not very sensitive to the assumed photon spectral index ( within a factor of 2 when changing the index to 2 or 4 ) .",
    "observations from 2004 to 2006 covering the position of grb  060602b are used to constrain the time averaged emission from this object .",
    "no signal was found in the 128 hours of available data , of which more than 80% were taken before the burst .",
    "assuming constant emission , a 99% flux upper limit ( using standard cuts ) of @xmath57 above 200 gev ( about 0.5% of the crab flux ) was found .",

    ", any radiation in the vhe range would very likely come from a high - energy component separated from that of the sub - mev radiation .",
    "the nature of grb 060602b is unclear .",
    "the softness of the bat spectrum and the proximity of grb  060602b to the galactic center suggest a possible galactic origin of the event .",
    "the observed temperature of @xmath41  kev ( using an absorbed blackbody fit ) using xrt data is within the range seen from type - i x - ray bursts  @xcite .",
    "swift_/bat team has consequently classified the event as an x - ray burst  @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that a faint source had been visible in an _ xmm - newton _ observation taken in the neighborhood of the grb  060602b position .",
    "two other _ xmm - newton _ observations were performed almost four months after the burst and a faint source was detected .",
    "the position of the faint source is marginally consistent with the _ swift_/xrt position of grb  060602b , within the large positional errors  ( up to @xmath60 , * ? ? ?",
    "however , no indication of variability of the source was seen and no secure spatial association of the source with grb  060602b was established .",
    "although a galactic origin is more likely , the possibility of the grb as a cosmological grb is not ruled out . in this section",
    ", we briefly discuss the implications of the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations according to these two scenarios .",
    "he @xmath0-ray emission have been detected in the _ prompt _ and/or _ afterglow _ phases of several grbs  @xcite . in these cases , no evidence for a high - energy cut - off was seen .",
    "the temporal evolution of the he emission of grb  941017 was found to be significantly different from its low - energy @xmath0-ray light curve  @xcite .",
    "for grb  970417a , if the excess events observed by milagrito were actually associated with the burst , the photon energy must be at least 650 gev and the vhe @xmath0-ray energy fluence must be at least an order of magnitude higher than the 50 - 300 kev energy fluence as seen by batse  @xcite .    in the vhe regime ,",
    "possible radiation mechanisms include leptonic scenarios : external - shock accelerated electrons up - scattering self - emitted photons  @xcite or photons from other shocked regions  @xcite , and hadronic scenarios : proton synchrotron emission  @xcite or cascades initiated by @xmath61 produced via photo - meson interactions  @xcite . in leptonic models ,",
    "one typically expects a positive correlation between x - ray flux and vhe @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "we note that the x - ray emission as seen by xrt decayed quickly , so one might expect the strongest vhe @xmath0-ray emission to occur during the _ prompt _ phase or soon after . in fact , during the _ early afterglow _ phase , some authors predict vhe @xmath0-ray energy flux levels comparable to or even higher than those in x - rays  @xcite .    the energy threshold of the h.e.s.s .",

    "the optical depth , @xmath62 , of the ebl absorption for a 1  tev and 250  gev photon is about unity at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if grb  060602b occurred at @xmath65 , ebl absorption could be neglected . under this assumption , the h.e.s.s .",
    "flux limits would exclude an intrinsic vhe @xmath0-ray _ prompt _ and _ afterglow _ energy fluence much higher than that at sub - mev energies ( see figure  [ sed ] ) .",
    "also , a vhe @xmath0-ray fluence level such as the one implied by the possible @xmath0-ray events associated with grb  970417a would be excluded for grb  060602b . and",
    "the upper limits would constrain models which predict vhe @xmath0-ray energy flux levels higher than those in x - rays during @xmath56 after the burst . if , however , grb  060602b occurred at @xmath66 , ebl absorption would be more severe and",
    "the observed limits would have to be increased by a factor which depends both on the redshift and the detailed gamma - ray spectrum of the grb . in this case , the limits would be less constraining .",
    "x - ray binaries have been suspected to be vhe @xmath0-ray emitters for decades ,  see , e.g. the review by  @xcite , and have recently been confirmed for at least three cases  @xcite .",
    "type - i x - ray bursts , originating from low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and with typical duration of 10  s up to several minutes , are caused by thermonuclear flashes on the surface of accreting neutron stars  @xcite .",

    "based on the bat spectrum of the burst and the possible identification of a faint _ xmm - newton _ x - ray counterpart , @xcite prefer the type - i x - ray burst scenario . in this case",

    "@xcite reported a tentative evidence of a possible tev burst emission with hegra during radio / x - ray outbursts ( on a scale of days ) of the microquasar grs  1915 + 105 , which is a lmxb listed in  @xcite .",
    "persistent vhe @xmath0-ray emission from lmxbs containing a neutron star was predicted  @xcite .",
