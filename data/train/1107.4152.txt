    "micro- and nano - mechanical resonators can be efficiently coupled with a large number of different devices and therefore represent a key tool for the realization of quantum interfaces , able to store and redistribute quantum information .",
    "very popular examples are electromechanical systems in which a mechanical resonator ( mr ) can be coupled either capacitively or inductively with a an electric circuit  @xcite , or optomechanical systems in which either radiation pressure or the gradient force allows strong coupling with an optical cavity mode @xcite .",
    "more recently various schemes have been proposed in order to couple a mr either with single atoms @xcite or with atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "a quantum interface must be able to transfer with high fidelity quantum state between different degrees of freedom and this can be implemented either via a quantum transfer protocol or exploiting entanglement .",
    "a large number of schemes have been recently proposed for entangling hybrid systems involving a mr .",
    "one could entangle a nanomechanical oscillator with a cooper - pair box @xcite , or may entangle two charge qubits @xcite or two josephson junctions @xcite via nanomechanical alternatively , schemes for entangling a superconducting coplanar waveguide field with a nanomechanical resonator , either via a cooper pair box within the waveguide @xcite , or via direct capacitive coupling @xcite , have been proposed .",
    "motivated by the above - mentioned studies , we show that a mr can be employed to couple efficiently microwave and optical fields , which simultaneously interact with it . in particular we show that stationary , i.e. , long - lived , microwave - optical entanglement can be generated in such a hybrid tripartite device .",
    "this mechanical transduction at the quantum level would be extremely useful in quantum information networks because light modes are unaffected by thermal noise and easily connect distant nodes of the network , while microwave cavities in each nodes can be efficiently coupled with molecular and solid - state qubits @xcite .",
    "the considered hybrid system was also recently suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and could be based on a lumped - element superconducting circuit with a free standing drum - head capacitor analogous to that of ref .",
    "in fact , the drum - head capacitor could be optically coated and form one micro - mirror of a fabry - perot optical cavity . in this way",
    "the vibrating drum - head is at the same time capacitively coupled with the microwave cavity mode and coupled via radiation pressure with the optical cavity mode .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the proposed system and derive the quantum langevin equations ( qle ) . in sec .",
    "iii , the linearization of the quantum langevin equations around the semiclassical steady state is discussed . in sec .",
    "iv we study the steady state of the system and quantify the entanglement by using the logarithmic negativity .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in sec . v.",
    "the proposed scheme is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we assume a mr which on the one side is capacitively coupled to the field of a superconducting microwave cavity ( mc ) of resonant frequency @xmath0 and , on the other side , coupled to a driven optical cavity ( oc ) with resonant frequency @xmath1 .",
    "such a system might be possible using the lumped - element circuit superconducting circuits with free standing drum - head capacitors recently developed by teufel et al .  @xcite .",
    "in fact , by adding an optical coating , the drum - head capacitor could also play the role of the micromirror of a fabry - perot optical cavity formed with a second standard input mirror .",

    "the mr is coupled to the microwave cavity because the capacity of the latter is a function of the resonator displacement , @xmath20 .",

    "one can safely assume @xmath48 since @xmath49 at optical frequencies , while thermal microwave photons can not be neglected in general , even at very low temperatures .",
    "our aim is to study the conditions under which one can efficiently correlate and entangle optical and microwave fields by means of the common interaction with a mechanical resonator .",
    "a straightforward way for achieving stationary and robust entanglement in continuous variable ( cv ) optomechanical systems , is to choose an operating point where the cavity is intensely driven so that the intracavity field is strong @xcite . under these conditions it is appropriate to focus onto the linearized dynamics of the quantum fluctuations around the semiclassical fixed points . for this purpose ,",

    "the fixed points are obtained by setting the derivatives to zero , getting @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 describe the effective detuning of the optical and microwave cavities field , respectively .",
    "when both the optical and microwave intracavity fields are intense , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , one can safely linearize the dynamics around the steady state and obtain the following linear qle for the quantum fluctuations of the tripartite system    [ qles2 ] @xmath59    where we have chosen the phase references so that @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be taken real and positive .",
    "the interaction of the optical and microwave field with the mechanical resonator is able to generate cv entanglement , i.e. , quantum correlations between appropriate quadratures of the two intracavity fields and the position and momentum of the resonator .",

    "the results are shown in figs .  2 and 3 , where we study the dependence of the three possible bipartite entanglement at the steady state of the system versus the detuning of the microwave cavity and for different values of the temperature and of the mass of the mechanical resonator .",
    "as suggested in the introduction , we have assumed an experimental situation representing a feasible extension of the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , we have assumed a lumped - element superconducting circuit with a free standing drum - head capacitor which is then optically coated to form a micromirror of an additional optical fabry - perot cavity .",
    "we have taken parameter analogous to that of ref .",
    "@xcite for the mc and mr , that is , a mr with @xmath98 mhz , @xmath99 , and a mc with @xmath100 ghz , @xmath101 , driven by a microwave source with power @xmath102 mw . the coupling between the two is determined by the parameters @xmath103 nm , @xmath104 .",
    "we have considered a lower mechanical quality factor , and resonator masses between @xmath105 ng and @xmath106 ng , i.e. , higher than that of ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to take into account the presence of the coating , which typically worsens the mechanical properties .",
    "we have then assumed an oc of length @xmath107 mm , damping rate @xmath108 , driven by a laser with wavelength @xmath109 nm and power @xmath110 .",
    "the optical cavity detuning has been fixed at @xmath111 which turns out to be the most convenient choice ( see below ) .     of the three bipartite subsystems ( oc - mc full black line , oc - mr dotted red line ,",
    "mc - mr dashed blue line ) versus the normalized microwave cavity detuning @xmath112 at fixed temperature @xmath113 mk , and at three different mr masses : @xmath114 ng ( a ) , @xmath115 ng ( b ) , @xmath116 ng ( c ) .",
    "the optical cavity detuning has been fixed at @xmath111 , while the other parameters are @xmath98 mhz , @xmath99 , @xmath100 ghz , @xmath101 , @xmath102 mw , @xmath103 nm , @xmath104 , @xmath108 , @xmath110.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]     of the three bipartite subsystems ( oc - mc full black line , oc - mr dotted red line , mc - mr dashed blue line ) versus the normalized microwave cavity detuning @xmath112 at fixed resonator mass @xmath114 ng and at three different temperatures : @xmath117 mk ( a ) , @xmath118 mk ( b ) , @xmath119 mk ( c ) .",
    "the optical cavity detuning has been fixed at @xmath111 , while the other parameters are as in fig .",
    "2.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    fig .",
    "2 shows the three bipartite logarithmic negativities , @xmath120 ( full black line ) , @xmath121 ( dashed blue line ) , @xmath122 ( dotted red line ) as a function of the normalized microwave cavity detuning @xmath112 at fixed temperature @xmath113 mk , and at three different mr masses : @xmath114 ng ( a ) , @xmath115 ng ( b ) , @xmath116 ng ( c ) .",
    "we see that for increasing masses the three kind of bipartite entanglement decrease overall , because by increasing masses , both couplings @xmath123 and @xmath124 decrease .",
    "however the three logarithmic negativities do not behave in the same way and entanglement sharing is evident .",
    "in particular the entanglement of interest , i.e. , @xmath120 , increases at the expense of the optical - mechanical entanglement , while @xmath121 remains always non - negligible . another relevant feature ( which we explain in the following ) are the double peaks of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which however tends to merge for larger masses , i.e. , smaller couplings .",
    "the stability conditions are always satisfied in the chosen parameter regime , which corresponds to a situation where the red - detuned cavity field ( the optical mode in the present case ) is coupled more strongly to the resonator than the blue - detuned field ( the microwave mode ) , because instability is achieved easier in the blue - detuned case @xcite .",
    "fig .  3 instead shows the log - negativity of the three bipartite subsystems ( oc - mc full black line , oc - mr dotted red line , mc - mr dashed blue line ) versus the normalized microwave cavity detuning @xmath112 at fixed resonator mass @xmath114 ng , and at three different temperatures : @xmath117 mk ( a ) , @xmath118 mk ( b ) , @xmath119 mk ( c ) . as expected , the three kinds of bipartite entanglement decrease at increasing temperatures , and even if nonzero , the log - negativity is already quite small at @xmath118 mk .",
    "also in these plots entanglement sharing is evident and one kind of entanglement always increases at the expense of the others .",
    "more in general , the scheme is able to generate appreciable entanglement between the optical and the microwave cavity fields , especially at the expense of the optical - mechanical entanglement , while unfortunately the mechanical resonator remains always appreciably entangled with the microwave cavity .",
    "similar bipartite entanglement dynamics can be observed in other alike tripartite system , as the atom - field - mirror system of ref .",
    "@xcite and the two cavity optomechanical setup of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one can provide an intuitive explanation of the above behavior and in particular of the mechanism through which the optical and microwave modes gets entangled through their interactions with the mechanical resonator .",
    "it is convenient to move to the interaction picture with respect to @xmath125 , formally solve the dynamics of the mr in eqs .",
    "( [ qles2 ] ) , and insert this formal solution into the dynamical equations of the two modes .",
    "one gets the following exact equations    [ qlesappr ] @xmath126\\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left.+ g_c g_w\\left[\\delta b(s)e^{i\\delta_c t - i\\delta_w s}+ \\delta b^{\\dagger}(s)e^{i\\delta_c t+i\\delta_w s}\\right]\\right\\},\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\delta \\dot{b}=-\\kappa_w \\delta b+\\sqrt{2\\kappa_w}b_{in}e^{i\\delta_w t } \\\\ & & + \\frac{i}{2 } \\int_{-\\infty}^t ds \\chi_m(t - s)\\left\\{g_w \\xi(s ) e^{i\\delta_w t}\\right . \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left.+g_w^2\\left[\\delta b(s)e^{i\\delta_w ( t - s ) } + \\delta b^{\\dagger}(s)e^{i\\delta_w ( t+s)}\\right]\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left.+ g_c g_w\\left[\\delta a(s)e^{i\\delta_w t - i\\delta_c s}+ \\delta a^{\\dagger}(s)e^{i\\delta_w t+i\\delta_c s}\\right]\\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath127 is the mechanical susceptibility .",
    "these equations show that the mr mediates an effective retarded interaction between the optical and cavity modes which may originate various phenomena : i ) cavity frequency shifts and single mode squeezing for both modes ; ii ) excitation transfer between the two modes ; iii ) two - mode squeezing between optical and microwave photons .",
    "one can resonantly select one of these processes by appropriately adjusting the cavity detunings .",
    "in particular , if we choose opposite detunings @xmath128 , and assume the regime of fast mechanical oscillations , @xmath129 , which allows us to neglect the fast oscillating terms at @xmath130 in the above equations , single mode squeezing and excitation transfer terms become negligible and eqs .",
    "( [ qlesappr ] ) can be written as    [ qlesappr2 ] @xmath131    where we have redefined the noise terms @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and also @xmath135 .",
    "these equations show that apart from noise terms and frequency shifts , the two modes undergo a retarded parametric interaction with a time dependent coupling kernel @xmath136 .",
    "this parametric interaction is resonantly large when @xmath137 because when this condition is not satisfied the kernel rapidly oscillates and the interaction tends to average to zero .",
    "therefore for not too large @xmath123 and @xmath124 , one expects to find optical - microwave entanglement around @xmath138 , as it is evident in fig .",
    "2c corresponding to a larger mass and therefore smaller couplings . for smaller masses ,",
    "the rotating - wave argument above starts to be less valid , but one expects that the `` resonance '' condition for entanglement @xmath139 is replaced by a condition @xmath140 , where @xmath141 are the two eigenvalues corresponding to normal - mode splitting @xcite , i.e. , to the splitting of the two degenerate eigenvalues which are equal to @xmath142 in the limit of very small couplings .",
    "this normal - mode splitting phenomenon explains therefore the double - peak structure of the optical - microwave entanglement appearing at smaller masses .",
    "we have proposed a scheme for the realization of a hybrid quantum correlated tripartite system formed by an optical cavity and a microwave cavity , both interacting with a mechanical resonator .",
    "we have studied its dynamics adopting a qle treatment .",
    "we have focused on the steady state of the system and in particular on the stationary quantum fluctuations of the system , by solving the linearized dynamics around the classical steady state .",
    "we have seen that in an experimentally accessible parameter regime , the steady state of the system shows bipartite cv entanglement for all the possible bipartite subsystems .",
    "in particular the mr is able to mediate the realization of robust stationary ( i.e. , persistent ) entanglement between the optical and microwave cavity modes , which could be extremely useful in quantum information network in which light modes are used for quantum communications , and microwave cavities are used in the nodes for interfacing with solid - state qubits .",
    "in fact , in quantum networks one often needs to transfer and store states carried by light modes into local quantum processors , which are typically manipulated by microwave fields . the hybrid device discussed here ,",
    "thanks to the mediating action of the mr , allows to establish a robust and stationary entanglement between the optical and microwave fields which can be exploited for such a state transfer .",
    "for example , high - fidelity state transfer from an optical field onto the intracavity microwave field can be realized by implementing a cv teleportation protocol in which the input optical field and the optical cavity field are subject to homodyne measurements and the result of this measurement is fed - forward to the microwave cavity , where it is used for conditionally displacing its state .",
    "the present values of @xmath143 , even if not large , allows to achieve teleportation fidelities larger than those achievable with only classical means ( see for example @xcite ) .",
