    "the discovery of the higgs particle @xcite raises the obvious question of whether there are more higgs - like particles .",
    "while the simplicity of the minimal standard model is very attractive , there are well - known issues that remain to be understood .",
    "so far , searches for additional neutral higgs bosons have found nothing up to a mass of the order of 1  tev ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the charged - higgs sector of the 2hdm has many features in common with the mssm , but it is a priori less constrained .",
    "the mass is essentially unknown , but constrained relative to other parameters of the model .",
    "compared to the mssm , there is more room for a wide range of masses . in particular",
    ", the charged higgs boson mass could a priori be rather different from the neutral higgs masses .    in the next section",
    "we shall introduce some basic notation , and review the most important constraints .",
    "then , in the following sections we will separately discuss three mass ranges . in section  [ sect : low - mass ] we discuss the light - mass case , where a top quark may decay to a charged higgs boson , @xmath2 . in section  [",
    "sect : intermediate - mass ] we discuss the intermediate mass region , where the charged higgs boson is too heavy to be produced via top decay , but where the model  ii is excluded by the @xmath3 constraint , up to of the order of 480  gev @xcite . in section",
    "[ sect : high - mass ] we consider still higher masses , where the @xmath3 constraint does not apply . for a complementary review , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "the 2hdm is a simple extension of the sm , described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we decompose the su(2 ) doublets as follows : @xmath4 with the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath5 real .",
    "the ratio between these is denoted @xmath6 , and plays an important role in the parametrization of the model .",
    "the potential is written as @xmath7\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2}(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1)^2 + \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)^2 + \\lambda_3(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1)(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2 )   + \\lambda_4(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_1)\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac12\\left[\\lambda_5(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)^2 + { \\hbox { h.c.}}\\right ] + \\left\\{\\left[\\lambda_6(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1)+\\lambda_7 ( \\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)\\right](\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2 ) + { \\rm { \\hbox { h.c.}}}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in many studies , the terms with @xmath8 and @xmath9 are left out , in order to control flavour - changing neutral interactions .",
    "the spectrum consists of three neutral higgs boson ( the lightest one is here assumed to be the discovered one , at 125  gev ) , and a charged pair , @xmath10 . if cp is conserved , there are two cp - even ones ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , arising from @xmath13 and @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : obasis ] ) ) , and an odd one ( @xmath15 , arising , together with the neutral goldstone boson , from @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "if , on the other hand cp is not conserved , they will mix to mass eigenstates @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath18 being the lightest one .",
    "the yukawa interactions can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are left - handed quark and lepton doublets , whereas @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the corresponding right - handed fields .",
    "different choices for the @xmath28 define different `` models '' : model  i is defined by @xmath29 ( and only @xmath29 ) coupling to all fermions , whereas in model  ii the @xmath30-type quarks and charged leptons couple exclusively to @xmath31 , whereas @xmath32-type quarks couple exclusively to @xmath29 .",
    "this is similar to the structure of the mssm @xcite .",
    "these coefficients @xmath28 are proportional to the quark ( and lepton ) masses , as required by the higgs mechanism .",
    "the implications for the charged - higgs coupling are that they will consist of two parts , one with a left - handed and the other with a right - handed projector , one proportional to the down - type mass , the other to the up - type mass .",
    "the different models give different combinations of projectors and mass factors .",
    "for example , for model  ii and third - generation quarks we have ( with all fields incoming ) @xmath33 , \\nonumber \\\\ & h^-   t\\bar b : & \\qquad & \\frac{ig}{2\\sqrt2 \\,m_w}\\,v_{tb}^ * [ m_b(1-\\gamma_5)\\tan\\beta+m_t(1+\\gamma_5)\\cot\\beta],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the su(2 ) coupling and @xmath35 the ckm matrix .",
    "there are also models  x and y , which are basically variants of models  i and ii , with different leptonic couplings .",
    "a recent summary of theoretical and experimental constraints can be found in ref .",
    "the theoretical constraints include positivity , unitarity and perturbativity , whereas the experimental ones arise from low - energy phenomena , such as various @xmath36-meson decays where the existence of a charged higgs boson would contribute additional effects , as well as precision measurements at lep constraining radiative corrections related to the electroweak bosons @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    among the constraints coming from @xmath36-meson decay , the @xmath39 decay ,",
    "which is experimentally well measured and in the sm dominated by a one - loop diagram involving the @xmath40 will in the 2hdm model  ii also get a contribution from @xmath41 exchange .",
    "careful analyses of this effect have led to a mass bound @xmath42 @xcite ( recently updated to @xmath43 @xcite ) , largely independent of @xmath44 .",
    "the relevant lep precision data , derived from the vacuum polarization , or radiative corrections to the @xmath37 and @xmath38 self - energies are usually quantified in terms of the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "if the charged higgs is heavy , the smallness of @xmath46 @xcite imposes strong constraints on the allowed splitting between @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "[ sect : low - mass ] in the low - mass region , where the @xmath41 can be produced via @xmath52 decay , model  ii and model  y are excluded by the @xmath39 constraint . for model",
    "i , all yukawa couplings are proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the sensitivity is larger at low @xmath44 .",
    "the lhc experiments have already set very strong bounds on the branching ratio for @xmath2 , assuming the decay @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "these bounds effectively exclude some range of low values of @xmath44 , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : br - top - limit ] , where the region _ above _ the dashed bars is excluded by the two experiments at the 95% cl .",
    "[ fig : br - top - limit ]    , for model  i , and three values of @xmath44 , as indicated ( solid ) .",
    "the figure is adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite , showing also 8  tev exclusion limits from atlas @xcite ( dashed , blue ) and cms @xcite ( dashed , red ) . ]",
    "it is seen that in the low - mass region , only model  i with high values of @xmath44 , @xmath55 is still allowed .",
    "model  x is like model  i in its couplings to quarks , and would thus have the same branching ratio for @xmath2 .",
    "however , the leptonic coupling is proportional to @xmath44 rather than @xmath53 .",
    "thus , at low values of @xmath44 the exclusion in model  x is somewhat less severe than in model  i.    in this mass region , assuming the @xmath56 and @xmath57 rates to be negligible ( due to phase space and couplings , respectively ) , we can approximate the @xmath54 branching ratio as @xmath58 in model  i , with both rates proportional to @xmath59 , the branching ratio is independent of @xmath44 and of the order of 0.7 @xcite , whereas in model  x the rate @xmath60 is instead proportional to @xmath61 and the branching ratio quickly approaches unity .",
    "thus , the deterioration in exclusion reach from model  i to model  x is rather modest .    in the decay of @xmath2 ,",
    "one has also searched for @xmath62 @xcite , but the model  i branching ratio is lower by a factor @xmath63 and this channel is not compatible with the @xmath64 channel .",
    "[ sect : intermediate - mass ] also in the intermediate - mass region , model  ii and model  y are excluded by the @xmath39 constraint .",
    "but in contrast to the low - mass region , the charged higgs boson can not be produced via top decay .",
    "a variety of production mechanisms are involved . in the 5-flavour scheme , where @xmath66 quarks are considered parts of the proton and",
    "have non - zero distribution functions , the relevant partonic processes are @xmath67 two comments are here in order :    * as indicated , the production can proceed via a neutral higgs boson in the @xmath68-channel .",
    "we recall the relevant couplings ( all fields incoming ) @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 refer to the momenta of the neutral and charged scalars .",
    "experimental data @xcite favour the alignment limit , where @xmath72 thus , in this limit only the heavier higgs bosons ( @xmath12 and @xmath15 ) can play a role here . allowing for cp non - conservation ( considering @xmath18 rather than @xmath11 ) does little to modify this conclusion . * in model",
    "i ( and model  x ) all couplings of the @xmath41 to quarks are proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the production cross section decreases with increasing values of @xmath44 .",
    "+ this is different from the mssm , which has a model  ii structure , and where the cross section has a minimum for intermediate values of @xmath44 , of the order of @xmath73 .    as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq : production ] ) , the kinematics may allow for @xmath68-channel resonant effects in the production @xcite .",
    "however , the smallness of @xmath46 does not allow for a large mass splitting between @xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",
    "this restricts the possible resonant enhancement .    likewise , there are various possible decay modes : @xmath74 as mentioned above , the @xmath75 vanishes in the alignment limit . for the more general case , allowing for cp violation ,",
    "the relevant coupling is given by @xmath76 ( p_\\mu - p_\\mu^\\mp).\\ ] ] here , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are two of the rotation angles describing mixing of the neutral higgs fields @xcite .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath78 would indicate cp violation .",
    "the decay @xmath57 ( or @xmath79 ) requires some deviation from the alignment limit , whereas @xmath80 and @xmath80 are limited by phase space .",
    "thus , in practice , the channels @xmath54 and @xmath1 are the most relevant ones , with the latter dominating by a @xmath44-independent factor of the order of @xmath81 .      the tau channel benefits from being rather `` clean '' , and interesting limits have been obtained .",
    "considering as an example , the case @xmath82 , we note that both atlas and cms obtain a 95%  cl bound @xmath83 at 8  tev @xcite . a recent atlas result at 13  tev is 0.41  pb . this is to be compared with the model expectation for the cross section and the branching ratio .",
    "approximate 14  tev cross sections are quoted in table  [ table : modeli - sigma ] for a few @xmath44 values .",
    "accurate values depend on the masses of the heavier neutral states . barring any significant decay to @xmath84 ,",
    "the relevant branching ratio is given by @xmath85 .",
    "it is seen that the theoretical expectation is far below the current experimental limit .",
    ".experimental limits on @xmath86 [ pb ] at 8 and 13  tev together with model  i cross sections @xcite at 14  tev , multiplied by a branching ratio taken to be @xmath87 .",
