    "the metropolis algorithm @xcite , proposed more than half a century ago has proved to be a very important and useful tool in monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , for the prediction of equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a large variety of systems . in this method one generates a large number of microscopic states of a system according to their canonical probabilities and the averages of different observables are calculated directly .",
    "however , problems crop up in the neighbourhood of a critical point , where due to critical slowing down @xcite it becomes rather difficult to overcome the large correlation time problem and get reliable results . also for simulating systems with difficult potential energy landscapes as in proteins , spin - glasses etc , simulation using metropolis algorithm results in trapping of the random walker in a potential energy minimum resulting in rather inefficient sampling . + during the last couple of decades or so a number of mc algorithms @xcite have been proposed which are designed to overcome the shortcomings of the metropolis algorithm . to deal with the critical slowing down in a discrete spin model a cluster algorithm",
    "was proposed by swendsen and wang @xcite , while the wolff cluster algorithm @xcite has proved to be an important tool for simulating continuous spin models .",
    "the multiple histogram reweighting technique of ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite emerged as a very useful method of improving the results obtainable from mc simulations in general .",
    "+ instead of tracing out the historical development of the mc algorithms , detailed discussion of most of which may be found in recent books like newman and berkema @xcite and landau and binder @xcite , we mention two algorithms which are of particular relevance to the subject of this communication . one of these is the transition matrix monte carlo ( tmmc ) algorithm developed by oliveria et al @xcite and subsequently generalized by wang and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the other algorithm , which was developed by wang and landau @xcite and goes by their name ( wl ) , has drawn wide attention of researchers since its inception @xcite .",
    "both of these methods determine the density of states ( dos ) of a system as a function of one or more macroscopic observables like energy , order parameter , correlation function etc .",
    "a knowledge of the dos enables one to determine the partition function or the averages of other thermodynamic quantities by the usual boltzmann reweighting procedure . both tmmc and wl algorithms depend on broad sampling of the phase space and are easy to implement .",
    "while the wl algorithm is capable of an efficient sampling of the phase space , the tmmc method gives more accurate estimates of the dos and this improves with longer mc runs .",
    "+ shell and co - workers in 2003 @xcite proposed an algorithm which combines the tmmc and wl algorithms in an efficient way so as to make best use of the benefits of each algorithm .",
    "the new algorithm , known as the wang landau transition matrix ( wltm ) monte carlo algorithm , uses the wl sampling scheme along with the tmmc method so as to result in an algorithm which is both efficient and accurate .",
    "the method was tested by shell et .",
    "al @xcite in two dimensional ising model and a lenard - jones fluid which suggests that the method is capable of handling both discrete and continuous systems .",
    "+ in this communication we have performed elaborate wl and wltm simulation of two continuous spin models .",
    "continuous models are understandably more laborious and difficult subjects of mc simulation and need special considerations regarding the choice of certain parameters  a problem one does not encounter while simulating a discrete model .",
    "the aim of this paper is to critically judge the performance of wl and wltm methods in continuous systems .",
    "we have investigated the manner in which the performance of the wltm algorithm in particular could be improved in such systems .",
    "we have chosen @xmath0 the one dimensional lebwohl - lasher ( 1-d ll ) model @xcite and @xmath1 the two dimensional xy ( 2-d xy ) model for this purpose .",
    "the reason for the choice of the former is that the model is exactly solvable @xcite and hence one can compare the performance of the wltm algorithm with the exact results .",
    "this is analogous to the practice where the results of a new mc algorithm is being compared with the exact results on a 2d ising model . for the xy - model , where the exact partition function is not available , we have compared our results with the results of the conventional metropolis simulation .",
    "+ the scheme of the presentation is as follows .",
    "the wl , tmmc and wltm algorithms are briefly described in the next section . in section 3",
    "we have described the models we have worked upon .",
    "computational details appear next and is followed by the results we have obtained .",
    "in a system where the energy can take up continuous values , discretization of the energy range is necessary to label the macrostates of a system .",
    "the allowed energy range is divided into a number of bins , and the mean energy of the @xmath2 bin is taken as @xmath3 .",
    "the wl algorithm directly determines the density of states ( dos ) of the system as a function of @xmath3 which is precisely the number of microscopic configurations which have energy lying in the range which corresponds to the @xmath2 bin .",
    "this therefore is just the degeneracy factor which is denoted by @xmath4 and it is natural to consider bin - widths which are sufficiently small . of course one can perform wl simulation to determine the dos as a function of quantities other than energy like , say , the order parameter , correlation function etc .",
    "also , a determination of dos ( more precisely , joint density of states , jdos ) as a function of two variables is possible and is necessary in many situations @xcite . + for a macroscopic system , @xmath5 is a large number , and it is convenient to work with its logarithm , @xmath6 . at the beginning of the simulation one has no knowledge of the @xmath7 s  these are therefore set equal to zero for all values of @xmath8 and the algorithm generates the dos profile , which progressively becomes closer to the actual dos of the system , by an iterative process , which is briefly outlined below .",
    "since the dos is independent of temperature , and contains complete information about the system , the task is to determine it ( or the jdos , if necessary ) as accurately as possible .",
    "the rest of the work , which involves the determination of the partition function @xmath9 or other thermodynamic quantities at any temperature is done in a simple and straight forward manner by the standard boltzmann reweighting procedure .",
    "+ the implementation of the wl algorithm is done in the following manner .",
    "one starts with some microscopic configuration and a random walk is generated by rotating the spins ( one at a time , in our case ) . thus starting from a microstate @xmath10 one generates another state @xmath11 .",
    "the probability with which the transition @xmath12 is accepted is given by , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 relates the microstates with the corresponding macrosates .",
    "thus the probability of acceptance is inversely proportional to the current value of the dos . in the event of the new state",
    "being accepted one makes the following modifications :    [ accep ] @xmath16 @xmath17    here @xmath18 represents the histogram count of the @xmath2 bin and , @xmath19 is a modification factor whose initial value is greater than 1 ( in our case we started with @xmath20 ) . in case",
    "the probability test ( [ pe1e2 ] ) fails , the changes given in equation ( [ accep ] ) are made to the bin labelled by @xmath8 instead of j. this procedure is continued till the histogram becomes sufficiently flat , which may be say @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the histogram count @xmath18 for each value of @xmath8 is at least @xmath21 of the average @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of bins .",
    "when this condition is fulfilled , one iteration is said to be complete .",
    "one then resets the @xmath18 s to zero for each value of @xmath8 , changes @xmath24 ( or in some other way ) and starts a fresh iteration using the @xmath7 s which have been generated in the previous iteration .",
    "iterations are continued with the dos steadily approaching the true dos profile , till @xmath25 is sufficiently small .",
    "we have stopped the process when @xmath25 is as small as @xmath26 . the error which is present in the density of states",
    "has been predicted to be proportional to @xmath27 as is apparent from the theoretical work of zhou and bhatt @xcite .",
    "this has been tested for a number of discrete and continuous models and the prediction has been found to be correct @xcite .      the tmmc algorithm also directly evaluates the dos of a system and was first proposed by oliveria _",
    "@xcite in the year 1996 .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath28 be the labels of two macrostates and @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the set of all microstates which correspond to the states @xmath8 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "the probabilities for the transitions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are written as @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "both these quantities must satisfy the following conditions :    [ tmnorm ] @xmath33 @xmath34    the two types of transition probabilities are related in a simple manner . if @xmath4 and @xmath35 are the dos s corresponding to the macrostates @xmath8 and @xmath28 , then one can write , @xmath36 if @xmath37 is the reverse transition probability _",
    "i.e. _ for the @xmath38 transition , then from eqn ( 4 ) it follows that , @xmath39 the transitions like @xmath12 etc .",
    "are effected in a mc simulation by random walk in the configuration space and in lattice - spin models , and are constituted by spin flips ( in discrete model ) or spin rotations ( in continuous models ) .",
    "the process of transition @xmath12 is actually composed of two parts : @xmath0 the transition being proposed and @xmath1 it being accepted .",
    "if we represent by @xmath40 , the probability of proposing the transition @xmath12 and by @xmath41 , the probability of this being accepted then we can write , @xmath42 the probability @xmath40 depends on the type of mc move used while the quantity @xmath41 has the flexibility of being chosen .",
    "if one considers an infinite temperature then @xmath43 for all states @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this can easily be seen to be correct by considering a metropolis dynamics at infinite temperature ( then @xmath41 would simply be the ratio of the boltzmann factors of the two states ) . therefore combining equations ( [ tmratio1 ] ) and ( [ tp ] ) for the temperature @xmath44",
    ", we can write , @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the infinite temperature transition probability .",
    "it may be noted that the dos s which appear in the r.h.s . of equation ( [ tmratio2 ] )",
    "remain unchanged for these are not dependent on temperature . for random walk in the configuration space involving symmetric moves , like single spin flip or rotation , as we have done , @xmath47 and equation ( [ tmratio2 ] )",
    "can be simplified to , @xmath48 this equation indicates that one can calculate the dos from a knowledge of the infinite temperature transition probabilities .",
    "the procedure for this is to keep a record of a transition matrix , called the c - matrix , @xmath49 for all proposals @xmath50 , during the random walk .",
    "one starts the simulation with @xmath51 for all @xmath52 and updates the matrix by @xmath53 for each proposal @xmath50 .",
    "once the construction of the c - matrix is started it is never zeroed during the simulation .",
    "so the current estimate of the infinite temperature transition probability ( @xmath54 ) is given by , @xmath55 where the sum extends over all @xmath56 for which the @xmath57 transition can occur .",
    "of course , the c - matrix element , connecting states between which a transition can never be proposed is always zero . finally with the knowledge of @xmath58 one can estimate the dos ( @xmath59 ) from equation ( [ tw ] ) and this is possible at any stage of the simulation .",
    "however , equation ( [ tw ] ) leads to an over specified condition for the purpose of determining the @xmath59 s as , for a given initial state @xmath8 , a number of possible states @xmath28 can be proposed and each such pair @xmath60 satisfies equation ( [ tw ] ) leading to a number of equations for determining @xmath4 , say .",
    "one can then , for the best estimate of @xmath4 , make a multi - variable optimization as has been described in @xcite . for most simulations however , it is adequate only to consider transitions involving @xmath52 which are neighbouring states . in the tmmc algorithm , in order to ensure that the random walker visits all macrostates in the region of interest , a uniform ensemble , where all macrostates are equally probable is considered .",
    "the probability of occurrence of a given microstate @xmath10 is then inversely proportional to the number of microstates which are associated with the macrostate @xmath8 , where @xmath14 .",
    "so the probability of acceptance of a move @xmath12 is given by , @xmath61 since the density of states are not known a priori , the above acceptance criterion is implemented by using equation ( [ tw ] ) for the ratio of the density of states : @xmath62 it may be noted that in the above mentioned procedure one does not actually use the strict acceptance criterion for all proposed moves .",
    "this does not lead to any self contradiction in what has been stated in the arguments leading to equation ( [ pacctilde ] ) .",
    "this is because the manner in which one constructs the c - matrix , from which the estimate of the infinite - t transition probability is generated via equation ( [ ttilde ] ) , is independent of the actual acceptance probability used and depends only on the configurations which are being proposed .",
    "the errors in the tmmc simulation for different models have been described in detailed in the work of wang and swendsen @xcite .",
    "however , the tmmc algorithm suffers from a number of drawbacks .",
    "the most important of these is that the convergence of the density of states in this method is not guaranteed and consequently the method is inefficient in terms of the computer time necessary .      in the wltm algorithm , first proposed by shell and co - workers @xcite one efficiently combines the wl and tm monte carlo methods .",
    "here one uses the original acceptance criterion given by equation ( [ pacc ] ) and the density of states and a histogram count are updated via equation ( [ accep ] ) . along with this , a c - matrix , which is never zeroed ,",
    "is constructed and this may start at a suitable stage of the simulation process ( as is elaborated in section ( 5 ) below ) .",
    "the dos available from the c - matrix via the infinite - t transition probability ( equations ( [ ttilde ] ) and ( [ tw ] ) ) is used to replace the dos which is generated by the wl - algorithm .",
    "this we call the refreshing of the dos and is done after each iteration",
    ". the result of amalgamating the wl and tm algorithms is to yield a two fold advantage : @xmath0 better sampling of states due to the wl algorithm and @xmath1 improvement in the accuracy of dos as a result of the tmmc algorithm .",
    "in this model one considers a linear - array of three dimensional spins interacting with nearest neighbours ( nn ) via a potential , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the second legendre polynomial and @xmath65 is the angle between the nearest neighbour spins @xmath66 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "this model represents an one - dimensional nematic liquid crystal .",
    "the 3-d lebwohl - lasher ( ll ) model is a lattice version of a 3-d nematic , described in the mean field approximation by the mair - saupe theory @xcite , and exhibits an orientational order - disorder transition .",
    "the 1-d ll model has been simulated by @xcite and has also been solved exactly by vuillermot and romerio @xcite using a group theoretic method . as is to be expected in a low - dimensional model with nn interaction , the 1-d ll model does not exhibit any finite temperature phase transition .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite are quoted below .",
    "the partition function @xmath67 for the @xmath68 particle system is given by , @xmath69 d^n(\\widetilde{k}^{\\frac{1}{2}})\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "@xmath71 is the dawson function given by , @xmath72 the dimensionless internal energy @xmath73 , entropy @xmath74 and the specific heat @xmath75 are given by , @xmath76    @xmath77.\\ ] ]    @xmath78d^{-1}(\\widetilde{k}^\\frac{1}{2})-\\frac{1}{2}\\widetilde{k } d^{-2}(\\widetilde{k}^\\frac{1}{2}).\\ ] ]      in this model planar spins placed at the sites of a planar square lattice interact with nearest neighbours via a potential , @xmath79\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the angle between the nearest neighbours @xmath80 .",
    "[ this particular form of the interaction , rather than the more conventional @xmath81 form , was chosen by domany _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite to enable them to modify the shape of the potential easily , which led to what is now known as the modified xy - model ] .",
    "the xy - model is known to exhibit a quasi - long - range - order disorder transition which is mediated by unbinding of topological defects as has been described in the seminal work of kosterlitz and thoules @xcite .",
    "the xy - model has also been the subject of extensive mc simulation over last few decades and some of the recent results may be found in @xcite .",
    "in the 1-d ll model the configurations of the system are stored in terms of the direction cosines of the spins , i.e. a set of three numbers ( @xmath82 ) describe the orientation of each spin .",
    "the simulation is started with a random configuration of the spins . to generate a new configuration , one spin at a time",
    "is randomly selected and a move @xmath83 ( for i=1 , 2 , 3 ) is effected where @xmath84 is a uniformly generated random number between -1 and + 1 . to preserve the unit magnitude of the spins ,",
    "the normalization condition @xmath85 is always applied . in the 2-d xy - model ,",
    "two direction cosines are needed to describe the orientation of each spin . in the 1-d ll model , for a chain of length l ( in units of the lattice spacing ) , the energy of the system can have any value between -l to l/2 while for the 2-d xy - model of linear dimension l the system energy lies between 0 and @xmath86 . in order to apply the wl or wltm algorithm",
    "we have restricted the random walk in the energy space from -l to 0 and from 0 to @xmath87 for the 1-d and 2-d models respectively ( actually a small energy band near the ground state was also excluded as is explained below ) , and this energy range was divided into a number of bins , each having a width @xmath88 . at the beginning of the simulation , we set all @xmath7 s to zero .",
    "starting from a microstate @xmath10 , the random generation of configurations by the above mentioned procedure leads to a new state @xmath11 being proposed .",
    "the probability of acceptance of this state is given by @xmath89 in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "it may be noted that , there is always a possibility that @xmath11 and @xmath10 represent the microstates belonging to the same macrostate  in that case the move is always accepted .",
    "the random walk is continued until the histogram reaches 90% flatness . with the knowledge of the c - matrix which has accumulated in the process",
    ", we calculate the current dos and use it to refresh the previous dos .",
    "this completes one iteration , following which , we reduce the modification factor @xmath24 , reset the histogram counts to zero and start a new random walk cycle .",
    "it is important to note that the c - matrix is never reset to zero and hence it stores the entire history of the moves proposed in the simulation process .",
    "+ the iterations are continued till the factor @xmath25 gets reduced to @xmath26 .",
    "the wltm algorithm has the flexibility in that , it is possible to refresh the dos from the accumulated c - matrix at any stage .",
    "it is even possible to refresh at the very end when all the iterations have been completed . this therefore amounts to doing pure wl simulation along with keeping a record of the c - matrix which is used only at the end to refresh the dos .",
    "the dependence of the accuracy of the results resulting from refreshing the dos at different stages is described in the following section .",
    "we have simulated the 1-d model for system sizes @xmath90 and @xmath91 and the minimum of the energy range over which random walk has been carried out were -79 , -158 , -218 respectively , the upper limit being 0 in each case .",
    "the small cut in the energy near the ground state had to be made since it takes a prohibitively long time to fill these states .",
    "moves which take the system energy outside the specified range are rejected and the c - matrix is updated as @xmath92 where the index @xmath8 labels the initial state .    the energy bin - width was chosen to be @xmath93 in all cases and the parameter @xmath94 , defined in the previous section , was also chosen to be 0.1 . as the bin - width is made narrower , the number of microstates which correspond to a particular bin gets reduced .",
    "ideally , @xmath88 should be as small as possible for better discretization , but this is limited by computational difficulties in its implementation . choosing a very small bin - width increases the number of bins proportionately and the book - keeping work becomes difficult .",
    "problems arise both with cpu time as well as with available computer memory and this becomes severe particularly for a large lattice size .",
    "optimization of these considerations resulted in our choice of the bin width .",
    "+    the parameter @xmath94 determines the amplitude of a rotation which is given to a spin at the time of generating new configurations .",
    "too small a value of @xmath94 leads to the configuration being trapped in the same bin and a large value results in visits always outside the starting bin . actually , while simulating a continuous spin system using wl or wltm algorithm , a proper choice of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath94 is particularly important .",
    "clearly the two parameters are interrelated and our choice of @xmath95 for the particular value of @xmath93 was based on the consideration that about 50% of the attempted moves go outside the starting bin so that care is taken of microstates in the initial bin as well as its neighbours @xcite .",
    "this approach , besides ensuring a uniform sampling , also optimizes the cpu time .",
    "+    we have used the histogram flatness criterion to determine when an iteration with a given modification factor @xmath19 is to be terminated .",
    "this condition , although it increases the cpu time enormously , was found to be necessary for minimizing the errors in the observables .",
    "shell et al @xcite while prescribing the wltm algorithm suggested that a single visit to each macrostate should be enough to determine where to terminate an iteration .",
    "we have observed that while this works reasonably well for a model with a discrete energy spectrum @xcite , in a system with continuous energy spectrum , as is ours , a single visit criterion fails to work .",
    "this is however not surprising in view of the fact that when discretization is achieved by a certain choice of the energy bin - width , the multiplicity of states associated with each bin ( for any choice of bin - width ) is generally much greater than that for an energy level in a discrete system of comparable size .",
    "+    in figure 1 we have shown the plots of @xmath96 , the logarithm of the dos against the energy per spin for three system sizes .",
    "figure 2 is a plot of the error in lnz , ( z being the partition function ) and a comparison has been made with the exact results of @xcite .",
    "here we have presented the results of simulation where the construction of the c - matrix was started at different stages of iteration .",
    "we denote by @xmath97 a preassigned number and when the current value of @xmath25 becomes just less than @xmath97 , the construction of the c - matrix is started .",
    "for instance , the graph for @xmath98 shows the error in lnz obtained in the simulation in which the construction of the c - matrix was started when @xmath25 becomes just less than @xmath99 . following this",
    "the simulation was continued till @xmath25 reaches @xmath26 , with the usual procedure of dos refreshing along with the condition of 90% histogram flatness .",
    "it is clear from the figure that in order to get the best result , a compromise is to be made in getting the most useful c - matrix . if it is constructed from the very beginning of the simulation while the dos profile is far away from being a realistic representation of the actual one , the errors which accumulate in the c - data lead to large error .",
    "again when the construction begins at a stage too late , some important information of the simulation process is lost resulting again in increase in errors .",
    "in particular , figure 2 shows that the error for @xmath100 is significantly smaller than that for @xmath101 .",
    "also shown in figure 2 is the error in @xmath102 for pure wl simulation with the condition of @xmath21 histogram flatness imposed .",
    "it is clear from the diagram that it is possible to achieve better accuracy with the wltm algorithm .",
    "however the gain in the accuracy seems to be only marginal and that too is at an appreciable increase in the cpu time involved .",
    "+    in figure 3 is shown the error in @xmath102 for the three lattice sizes , achieved with the wltm algorithm and c - matrix updating corresponding to @xmath103 .",
    "since the theoretical estimate of @xmath102 @xcite is for the thermodynamic limit , it is natural to expect that the error should decrease with the increase in system size . in figure 4 , we have compared the wltm results obtained with the @xmath21 flatness method with those obtained with the single visit per bin condition imposed .",
    "it is clear that the latter leads to a huge error in the density of states and hence in the partition function and is not usable in a continuous model . in figure 5 , 6 and 7",
    "we have plotted the energy , specific heat and entropy against temperature for l=220 for @xmath101-simulation and the results have been compared with the exact values of these observables obtained from the exact results @xcite . in the inset in each figure",
    "we have also shown the corresponding errors in these parameters obtained in comparison with the exact results .",
    "+      in this model simulations were carried out for lattice sizes @xmath104 and @xmath105 and the corresponding minimum of the energy range were chosen to be 3 for each .",
    "histogram flatness was restricted to @xmath106 in all wl and wltm simulations .",
    "in addition to the already mentioned cut in the energy range , for the @xmath107 system , in order to save cpu time , we had to relax the condition for histogram flatness check for the first 500 bins .",
    "the xy - model and the phase transition it exhibits have been worked out in detail in references @xcite .",
    "however it is not possible to compare the results of our simulation in the xy - model for the dos or partition function , with the exact results for this model , as we have done for the 1-d ll model , because such exact results for this model are not available .",
    "[ fig8a.eps ]    we therefore present here a comparison of our wl and wltm results with those obtained from simulation using the conventional metropolis algorithm , which is known to work satisfactorily for this model @xcite . to increase the reliability of our results ,",
    "we have performed 20 independent simulations for each of the metropolis , wl and wltm method and have averaged the respective results . in the metropolis simulation the averaging was done directly over the observables while in the other two cases , the dos was averaged before it was used to obtain the observables . + regarding the choice of energy bin - width @xmath88 and the parameter @xmath94 , the considerations as were applied to the 1-d ll model , were taken into account . unless otherwise stated , we have used @xmath93 and @xmath95 in this model too . this led us to work with a large number of bins , namely 8000 , for the @xmath105 lattice .",
    "+ in figures 8(a ) and 8(b ) we have shown the variation of the average energy , @xmath108 and the specific heat , @xmath109 respectively with the temperature    for the @xmath104 and @xmath105 lattices , obtained with the wl , wltm and metropolis algorithms .",
    "this diagram and all the following diagrams , depicting the results of the xy - model , represent the results of 20 independent simulations for each of the algorithms used . as the plots shown in figure 8 do not clearly reveal the errors in the different simulations , we present these in detail in figure 9 .",
    "the percentage errors presented in figures 9 to 12 have been obtained by comparing the results of simulations with that obtained by using the metropolis algorithm .",
    "figure 9(a ) shows the errors in energy for the @xmath110 lattice obtained for the pure wl simulation and the wltm simulation for three different starting points of the c - matrix .",
    "figure 9(b ) shows the same for the specific heat @xmath109 .",
    "for the energy curve , wltm simulation with @xmath103 seems to be the best choice where the error is @xmath111 . in the specific heat curve , where the errors are slightly greater , as is to be expected for this being a fluctuations quantity , simulations with @xmath112 and @xmath103 have comparable errors .",
    "it is clear from these diagrams that the choice of @xmath113 for the commencement of the c - matrix leads to larger errors in the wltm simulation .",
    "figures 10(a ) and 10(b ) are the plots of the errors in energy and specific heat for the @xmath107 lattice .",
    "these diagrams clearly reveal that the errors in the pure wl algorithm are greater than those for the wltm algorithm and for the latter , the performance of the @xmath113 simulation is worst .    in figure 11",
    "we have shown the errors in specific heat @xmath109 for different choices of the bin width @xmath114 , other conditions remaining the same . as is perhaps to be expected , the smaller bin - width @xmath115 gives best results while the choice @xmath116 is the worst .",
    "these results are for the @xmath113 simulation .",
    "figure 12 demonstrates that the @xmath113 simulation with @xmath115 and the @xmath112 simulation for @xmath117 leads to comparable errors in @xmath109 .",
    "we have presented results of extensive mc simulations using wl and wltm algorithms in two continuous lattice spin models .",
    "simulation of continuous models needs a choice of two parameters , a bin - width @xmath88 ( for energy ) and @xmath94 , which determines the amplitude of the rotation to be imparted to the spins .",
    "we are of the opinion that while the bin - width should be as small as possible , depending on the computer resources available , the parameter determining the amplitude of spin rotation should be chosen in such a way that , of the proposed moves during the random walk , about @xmath118 should take the random walker out of the starting macrostate to a neighbouring one . in the simulation of a model involving continuous macroscopic variables , these two parameters critically determine the accuracy of the results , while no such considerations are needed for simulating a discrete model .",
    "+ our work on the two continuous models show that it is possible to obtain results of better accuracy with the wltm algorithm than that is obtainable from the wl algorithm . for this purpose",
    ", one must be careful about the starting point for the construction of the c - matrix .",
    "while this matrix should contain as much information as possible regarding the transitions proposed , care must be taken not to include information about the proposed moves which are generated very early in the simulation , when the profile of the dos is just in a formative stage .",
    "we had also to make an improvisation in the wltm algorithm regarding the question of convergence of the dos .",
    "the single visit to each macrostate criterion , which saves a lot of cpu time and was proposed by shell _ et .",
    "al _ in their original work @xcite , though adequate for a discrete model , seems to result in poor accuracy of the results for a continuous model .",
    "so we had to retain the condition for the flatness check of the histogram as is used in the original version of the wl algorithm .",
    "this of course results in a significant increase in the cpu time .",
    "+ we end this section with a few comments .",
    "we are of the opinion that the gain in accuracy over the wl algorithm which can be achieved using the wltm algorithm , with a choice of various parameters as well as the commencement point of the c - matrix , done in the most judicious way , is not significant .",
    "this too is possible only at the cost of a huge increase in cpu time .",
    "we would also point out that simulating a continuous model of a reasonably large size using the wltm algorithm , leads to the requirement of a vast amount of computer memory ( ram ) and it would be an almost impossible task if one needs to determine a joint density of state by performing a two - dimensional random walk ( including quantities like order parameter , correlation function etc . besides energy ) in a system of a reasonably large size .",
    "it may also be added that for this purpose , the wl algorithm has also proved to be inadequate @xcite .",
    "+ we are of the view that in order to simulate a continuous model of large size , the more than a decade old method of multiple histogram reweighting , proposed by ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite still seems to be the best choice .",
    "in addition , if one is dealing with a system not exhibiting a temperature induced first order phase transition , the wolff cluster algorithm @xcite is useful for reducing critical slowing down . examples of such work , to name a few , may be found in @xcite .",
    "the methods like wl , tm or wltm which directly determine the dos do not seem to be a suitable choice for these jobs , unless of course one uses a computer code for parallel processing using openmp or mpi @xcite .",
