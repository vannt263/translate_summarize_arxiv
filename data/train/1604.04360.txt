    "terms like incompressible , inviscous , inviscid , impermeable etc . have assimilated into the vocabulary of fluid mechanics quite naturally over the years @xcite .",
    "the usage of these words seem to be very casual in the context of the desired precision or accuracy in the field of mathematics and physics , yet one has hardly seen any resistance from the scientific community over the usage of such words .",
    "this is probably because of the fact that all these words have certain quantification .",
    "for example , although no flow in the real world is incompressible , this word has wide acceptability amongst the fluid dynamics community for fluid flows that remain within a mac number limit of 0.3 @xcite .",
    "however , it is highly questionable whether one can apply the word _",
    "infinite _ in the same vein to mean a large number of vortices present in a fluid flow without actually quantifying it , which of course is an extremely difficult task .    in the study of fluid flow , vortices are very important structures as they play a big role in controlling the dynamics of a flow @xcite .",
    "though they are known to occur in the vicinity of solid walls where the flow separation takes place , scientists have always been keener on probing the nature of vortices at the corners of solid structures .",
    "the existence of a sequence of vortices at the corner of solid structure for internal flows with decreasing size and rapidly decreasing intensity has been indicated by several physical experiments and mathematical asymptotics @xcite .",
    "their formation , evolution and progression on different geometrical and physical set up have always generated a lot of interest both amongst fluid dynamicists as well as mathematicians .",
    "study on the existence of these vortices dates back to the pioneering work of dean & montagnon @xcite which was later consolidated by moffatt @xcite .",
    "the flow near a sharp corner between two bounding planes was considered and a solution of the purely biharmonic equation for creeping flows @xcite was sought in terms of some exponential power @xmath0 of the distance @xmath1 from the corner .",
    "he found this @xmath0 to be a complex number when the angle between the two planes is less than about @xmath2 , implying infinite oscillations and hence concluded that there exists an infinite sequence of counter - rotating eddies as one approaches the corner . from then onwards , the occurrence of such corner vortices , named aptly as ",
    "_ moffatt vortices _ \" has always been synonymous with the existence of an infinite sequence , albeit without any rigorous mathematical proof .    in 1976 , collins & dennis @xcite computed the flow of a slow viscous fluid in a curved tube having a cross - section in the shape of a right - angled isosceles triangle .",
    "they observed vortices of moffatt s type firstly in the secondary flow in the @xmath3 corners and then in the 90@xmath4 corner . by refining the grid size of the computational domain and making use of extrapolation technique",

    "this was followed by several theoretical and numerical experiments @xcite on vortices around a corner in solid structures .",

    "anderson & davis @xcite presented a local picture of steady , two - dimensional ( 2d ) viscous flow of two fluids in a wedge .",

    "@xcite investigated laminar backward - facing step flow for a wide range of reynolds number and based on the theory of moffatt @xcite , concluded that an infinite sequence of closed eddies with decreasing size and strength is expected for @xmath5 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that although the study of moffatt vortices mainly pertains to stokes flow , the sequence of corner vortices in decreasing size and intensity can be found for moderately high reynolds number flows as well .",

    "he obtained the transcendental equation for the eigenvalues , which determines the asymptotic behavior of the flow in the neighborhood of the vertex , arriving at a conclusion similar to that drawn by moffatt @xcite . in 2014 ,",

    "as such the task of establishing the finiteness of the sequence of such vortices still remained unaccomplished and the question on infiniteness unanswered .",
    "the objective of the current study is to explore a possible missing link between the contrasting theories of moffatt vortices @xcite and the recent geometrical theories on incompressible viscous flows @xcite .",
    "we endeavor to bridge the gap between the factions by pinpointing what could have possibly gone wrong with the assumptions of the existing theories upon which the conclusion of infiniteness is built .",

    "the study of moffatt vortices under the purview of their topology and critical point theory has never been carried out before . in the current study , we for the first time , establish some novel theories on moffatt vortices including    * quantification of centers of these vortices as fixed points ( see section [ center ] , lemma [ bft_vort ] ) through brouwer fixed - point theorem ( theorem [ bft ] ) , * quantification of the largest neighborhood of the fixed point of a particular vortex as circle cell by extending the idea of circle cell for divergence - free vector fields of ma & wang @xcite .",
    "based on the above theories and some recent developments in geometric theory of incompressible viscous flows @xcite , and making use of some elementary mathematical analysis @xcite , we prove that the sequence of moffatt vortices in fluid flows around solid corners is finite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same conclusion is reached by tackling the hypothesis through six different approaches .",
    "note that in all the studies mentioned above , two - dimensional flows as an idealization of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) one or 3d flows having symmetry in one direction were considered .",
    "as such all the theories developed by us will be considered over planner regions only .",
    "the paper is arranged in the following manner : section [ contro ] deals with the controversies with the issue of the infiniteness of moffatt vortices , section [ wrong ] pertains to a brief on what might have gone wrong with the theory , section [ sec3 ] with preliminaries for proving the finiteness of moffatt vortices , section [ sec5 ] with the proofs on the finiteness of moffatt vortices and finally section [ sec6 ] summarizes the whole work .",
    "in this section , we throw some lights on the controversies surrounding the notion of infiniteness .",
    "they include the mathematical origin of moffatt vortices , certain concerns and questions over the issue which have not been settled till date .",
    "the existence of vortices in a flow field is a highly nonlinear phenomena and most importantly there exist an inherent connection between their occurrence and the nonlinear nature of navier - stokes ( n - s ) equations @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical studies on moffatt vortices seek the solution of the biharmonic form of the steady - state n - s equations for stokes flow in the streamfunction @xmath6 as @xmath7 which is a linear one .",
    "thus it completely annihilates all the effects of nonlinearity .",
    "the solution of ( [ bhr ] ) in polar coordinates @xmath8 is assumed to be of the form @xmath9 leading to an equation in @xmath10 @xmath11 resulting in a solution of the form @xcite @xmath12 the existence of the infinite sequence of vortices follows from ones ability in arriving at a solution of the form ( [ sln ] ) . making use of ( [ sln ] )",
    ", one can find the transverse component of velocity on the plane @xmath13 as @xcite @xmath14 the notion of an infinite sequence of vortices near the corner comes from the above expression by concluding that it changes sign infinitely as @xmath15 .",
    "another argument for the existence of the infinite sequence of eddies near a solid corner comes from the concept of discrete self - similarity .",
    "consider a flow domain @xmath16 , in which these vortices are defined in the flow whose streamfunction @xmath6 has the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 are some nonzero constants which satisfy @xmath19 then , if one considers the scaling @xmath20 both the domain @xmath21 and streamfunction @xmath6 remain invariant under the action of the scaling @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "note that the concept of discrete self - similarity follows from this notion of invariance .",
    "probably the earliest concern over the infiniteness of moffatt vortices was raised by gustafson _",
    "_ in the year 1989 @xcite where they questioned : ",
    "_ are any of these entities truly infinite dimensional ? _ \" ; by _ these entities _ , they meant the corner vortices in the famous lid driven cavity flow . according to them ,",
    "what actually had been sought physically or mathematically , was their existence in a large finite dimensional dynamical system without further venturing into the metaphysical meaning of infinity .",
    "they further mentioned that though the theory predicts an infinite sequence of vortices at the corner of the solid structure ( in particular they considered the lower two corners of the driven cavity ) , it is a linearized one ( see equation ( [ bhr ] ) ) .",
    "they had reservations on how much it depends on the linearizing assumptions and for what range of reynolds numbers it continues to hold for the full nonlinear n - s equations , which are the governing equations for incompressible viscous flows @xcite .",
    "true to their concerns , many of the existing and recent theorems on separation of incompressible viscous flows @xcite lean towards the existence of a finite number of vortices in a finite domain including corners .    in their study of unsteady separation induced by a vortex , obabko and cassel @xcite discusses about the viscous - inviscid interaction leading to spike formation .",
    "the presence of a primary vortex induces an adverse pressure gradient along a solid surface and the aforesaid interaction accelerates the spike formation leading to the formation of secondary vortices . the mechanisms for the creation of the tertiary , quaternary and the succeeding vortices is the same @xcite .",
    "the _ structural bifurcation theory _ of ghil _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , by predicting the exact location and time of the birth of a vortex clearly establishes that the birth of the vortices in the sequence in a corner occurs one after another in succession .",
    "the clear implication of all these theories @xcite is the following fact : the birth of two vortices in succession or any two vortices in the same sequence can not take place at the same instant of time .",
    "this is in direct contrast with the infiniteness of corner vortices in steady state flow resulting from the solution of ( [ bhr ] ) , which would have taken infinite time to reach the steady state through time - marching .",
    "all the existing geometrical theories on incompressible viscous flows ( bakker @xcite , dlery @xcite , ma & wang @xcite , hirschel @xcite , wu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) based on the concept of dynamical system @xcite express vortical structures in terms of critical points in bounded domains .",
    "they again indicate a strong opposition to the notion of infiniteness . despite this , even for the lid - driven cavity problem , which over the years has become the most frequently used benchmark problem amongst the computational fluid dynamics community and",
    "is an obvious example of internal incompressible viscous flow , claims of infinite sequence of corner vortices can still be found in the existing literature for this problem @xcite .",
    "it is a well known fact that the formation of the so called infinite sequence of vortices in stokes flow is due to the effect of certain stirring / rotating force far from the corner @xcite .",
    "a further undermining into the existing literature reveals a very vague picture of the extent of the domains over which the flow is considered .",
    "if the source of the force is an infinite distance away from the corner , the effect of stirring / rotating force will fall down gradually with a proportional fall in the intensity of the force or the strength of the vortices at their centers as one moves away from the source . at a certain distance from the source of the given force",
    ", no effect of it will be felt .",
    "thus the process of the formation of the vortices will be well over much before reaching the corner .",
    "on the other hand the theory of moffatt vortices considers the existence of the infinite sequence vortices in the neighborhood of the corner where @xmath24 .",
    "thus a source force at an infinite distance from the corner nullifies the presence of the so called infinite sequence of vortices at the corner indicated by mathematical asymptotes .",
    "one of the main source of the infiniteness of the sequence of vortices is the so called discrete self - similarity of infinite degree of these vortices , which unfortunately is not physically feasible .",
    "for example , natural objects like fern and cauliflower exhibit self - similarity only under finite degrees of magnification ( upto finite number of stages / steps )",
    ". moreover , if this notion of infinite degree of magnification is to hold true , even in stokes flow , one must be able to actually accommodate an entire  tail \" of eddies - sequence below the kolmogorov ( see section [ kol ] ) length - scale , which is physically impossible .",
    "only recently , in 2006 , moffatt and his co - worker branicki @xcite has broached upon the possibility of the finiteness of these sequence of vortices for certain cases . analyzing the time - periodic evolution of stokes flow near a corner , they concluded that depending upon the smoothness and angle of the corner , and on the nature of the forcing , an infinite sequence of corner eddies may be present if the corner is sharp . on the other hand ,",
    "if corners are rounded off so that the boundary is everywhere analytic , it is expected that a finite sequence of eddies may still form in regions near points of maximum curvature on the boundary .",
    "but the big question here is : is there a slight transition from a smooth to a sharp corner good enough to trigger infiniteness to the sequence of vortices ?",
    "if so , how does one quantify this sudden jump from finite to infinite number of vortices and then again , what is this thin line between the extent of smoothness and sharpness leading to this enormous jump ?    moreover , as mentioned in section [ origin ] , the concept of moffatt vortices comes from the solution of the linearized version of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "these equations are derived under the assumption of  _ continuum hypothesis _ \" @xcite . according to this hypothesis",
    ", even the smallest volume scale can not be zero ; for example , for air , it is of the order @xmath25 containing approximately @xmath26 molecules under standard conditions .",
    "note that an infinite sequence of vortices of decreasing size renders a size zero to the vortices belonging to the tail of the sequence ( see proof 4 of theorem 7.1 in section [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "however , this conclusion stems out from the solution of equation ( [ bhr ] ) which is built under the assumption of continuum hypothesis requiring a minimum non - zero volume scale .",
    "this clearly contradicts the existence of an infinite number of vortices in the corner of solid structures .",
    "the kolmogorov length scale corroborates this fact .",
    "stokes flow and turbulent flows are at the extreme ends of the spectrum of incompressible viscous flow regime characterised by the reynolds number .",
    "therefore , the mention of the kolmogorov scale @xcite may sound totally irrelevant in the context of stokes flow .",
    "juxtaposed to this , this length scale plays an important role in our analysis .",
    "the kolmogorov theory clearly states that vortices can not exist below a certain non - zero length scale @xcite , since the local value of power density ( @xmath27 ) would be so high that the kinetic energy would be fully dissipated as heat .",
    "an estimate for the scales at which the energy is dissipated is based only on the dissipation rate and viscosity .",
    "if the dissipation rate per unit mass ( @xmath27 ) has dimensions ( @xmath28 ) and viscosity , @xmath29 has dimension ( @xmath30 ) then the length scale formed from these quantities is given by @xmath31 this length scale is called the kolmogorov length scale @xcite .    note",
    "that the smallest length scale for incompressible viscous flows occurs in the turbulent regime .",
    "stokes flow , for that matter laminar flows in the moderate reynolds number regimes will have vortices having much bigger scales than those prevalent in turbulent regime . as such ,",
    "the size of a vortex under consideration in the current study can not fall below the kolmogorov length scale .",
    "in the above , we listed the concerns and the related questions in connection with the infiniteness of moffatt vortices . in the following , we endeavor to bridge the gap by addressing what actually went wrong with the notion of infiniteness and subsequently providing our own set of proofs on the finiteness of corner vortices . here",
    "we will reflect upon the shortcomings of the assumptions of the existing theorems upon which the conclusion of infiniteness of corner vortices is built .",
    "these observations will help us pinpoint where the existing hypothesis went wrong and pave the way for providing a concrete mathematical basis that predict the correct physical phenomenon .",
    "the foremost argument provided in favour of the infinite sequence of vortices stems out from the velocity component ( [ vel_tran ] ) arising out of equation ( [ bhr ] ) . as discussed in sections [ origin ] and",
    "[ big ] , ( [ bhr ] ) inherently assumes the  continuum hypothesis \" , can this @xmath32 in the expression @xmath33 actually tend to zero ?",
    "note that the absolute size of the eddies is directly proportional to the length scale @xmath34 . for a large @xmath34 ,",
    "one may mathematically let @xmath35 by letting @xmath36 , however , in reality @xmath32 can never tend to zero .",
    "moreover on a finite domain , @xmath34 is bounded and hence can never tend to @xmath37 .",
    "as such the assumption in @xcite that @xmath34 is an arbitrary length scale is physically incorrect .",
    "this is where the mathematical exuberance tends to overshadow physical reality in a conflicting manner ; ideally one would desire mathematics to go hand in hand with physics .",
    "furthermore , the number of eddies will decrease even more due to dampening - effect after the collision of the fluid with the wall .",
    "this effect is completely ignored in this context .",
    "note that the notion of infiniteness comes from the so called infinite oscillations of the sine waves depicting the streamfunction value as a solution of ( [ bhr ] ) .",
    "however , on a finite domain , the number of such waves must be finite and they can be thought as representing discrete oscillations @xcite .",
    "the maximum wave length that can be accommodated inside a finite domain is the longest inscribable rectilinear length in the domain .",
    "the measure of the minimum wavelength is equal to twice the mean free path of the fluid molecules , which is nothing but the average distance traveled by a moving fluid particle between successive collisions .",
    "thus even when the vortices reach molecular level , this minimum wavelength can not be zero .",
    "as such the largest number of vortices having a one to one correspondence with the oscillatory waves must be finite .",
    "in the following , we provide some definitions , theorems and results from the existing literature on topological fluid dynamics @xcite and some of our own newly developed theories ( see section [ center ] ) , which will be used in appropriate junctures to prove the finiteness of the corner vortices .",

    "if we consider a neighborhood in the corner of the solid structure then the neighborhood contains finitely many singular points .",
    "so number of vortices can not be infinite .",
    "* we have already defined the largest neighborhood of the center of a vortex as a circle cell . by structural classification theorem i ( theorem [ sct1 ] )",
    ", the number of circle cells must be finite . since only one circle cell is uniquely connected with one vortex in the flow field",
    ", the number of vortices in the corner must be finite .",

    "the number of separation points is finite in the flow domain .",
    "therefore , the number of vortices is finite in the flow domain .",
    "* let @xmath107 be the sequence of vortices in the corner and the size of the @xmath108 vortex be @xmath109 which is defined as the distance of the center of the @xmath108 vortex from the corner . in the sequence of vortices ,",

    "in other words , given any such positive @xmath121 , the vortices in a ",
    "tail of the sequence \" ( all the members after a fixed index , @xmath122 here ) will lie within a distance of @xmath121 from the corner .",
    "+ from kolmogorov length scale ( section [ kol ] ) , if we choose @xmath123 then there exist an index @xmath124 such that @xmath125 for all @xmath126 .",
    "consequently , the number of vortices can never exceed @xmath127 , which is a finite quantity as in order to have the number of vortices more than @xmath127 , we must have vortices violating the kolmogorov length scale , which is impossible .",
    "let us define the diameter of a vortex @xmath128 by @xmath129 this @xmath130 is always a finite positive real number .",
    "_ note that @xmath131 and @xmath132 does not belong to @xmath133 .",
    "therefore the set @xmath134 is non - empty .",
    "further the set is bounded below as @xmath135 for all @xmath136 .",
    "since @xmath133 being a simple closed curve is a closed set , therefore @xmath137 such that @xmath138 letting @xmath139 clearly asserts that it is a finite positive real number .",
    "this completes the proof of the lemma . @xmath103    * we define diameter , @xmath130 of a vortex as the diameter of the largest disk which can be inscribed inside the vortex such that the center of the disk coincides with the center of the vortex .",
    "we term such a disk as the diametric disk .",
    "refer to figure [ fig4 ] for a schematic of this situation .",
    "( note that the the sequence of disks in this figure are actually inscribed inside the boundaries of the sequence of vortices obtained from our own simulation of the flow in a 2d triangular lid - driven cavity for a creeping flow corresponding to @xmath140 . )",
    "+ the above lemma clearly asserts the existence of such a length scale .",
    "furthermore the diametric disks corresponding to a sequence of vortices are mutually disjoint as otherwise any two intersecting diametric disks will result in overlapping of two distinct vortices which is physically impossible . now the sequence of diameters , @xmath141 corresponding to the sequence of vortices is monotonically decreasing in nature and bounded below as they are positive quantity .",
    "so this sequence is convergent and it converges to a non - negative real number , say @xmath142 . + * case - i : * when @xmath143 , then the total length required to accommodate all those vortices in the flow domain is greater or equal to @xmath144 . if the sequence of vortices is infinite and we replace @xmath145 by @xmath142 ( limiting diameter ) in the summation , we have @xmath146 .",
    "this is impossible , as size of the fluid flow domain is finite",
    ". therefore number of vortices in the flow domain can not be infinite if @xmath143 . +",
    "* case - ii : * when @xmath147 , then in order to have infinite number of vortices in the flow domain , the diameter of the extreme smallest vortex has to drop below the kolmogorov length scale ( see section [ kol ] ) , @xmath148 , feasible length scale to measure fluid vortices .",
    "now as @xmath149 , this implies @xmath150 such that @xmath151 for all @xmath152 .",
    "consequently , we can never have a vortex with diameter @xmath145 for any @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , the maximum possible number of vortices becomes less than @xmath153 , which is finite .",
    "+ therefore , the number of vortices in the flow domain must be finite .",
    "* this proof is based on the concept of limit cycles . in order to have a clear understanding of limit cycles present in incompressible viscous flows , we exhibit certain results from our own simulation of the 3d lid - driven cavity flow . in 3d flows , vortices are formed swirling around a three dimensional space curve known as the vortical coreline .",
    "such a scenario can be seen from figure [ fig5 ] where we present the vortical structure around + .",
    "one can actually see the vortical structures swirl around the vortical corelines in the figure.,height=226 ] + the vortical coreline from our own simulation of the flow for @xmath154",

    "note that @xmath155 is the tangent vector to the vortical coreline at the point at which the frenet trihendron is considered .",
    "+    + as has been mentioned earlier , 2d flows in confined domains are in fact idealizations of 3d flows ; for example , the flow in the plane of symmetry ( cross - flow plane ) for the 3d lid - driven cavity . + the projection of the streamlines of the normal plane over the cross - flow plane are topologically equivalent ( as projection map from plane to plane is a homeomorphism )",
    ". therefore limit cycles must be present in the cross - flow plane as well .",
    "note that these limit cycles correspond to the vortices with centers at the coreline for planner flows in 2d .",
    "we present two such limit cycles in the cross - flow plane corresponding to the primary vortex and the secondary vortex at the bottom right corner depicted by dark - black closed curves in figures [ fig7](a ) and [ fig7](b ) respectively .",
    "+ [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]    + in 3d flows , all the vortices correspond to stable limit cycles originating in foci while in 2d flows , they are simply _ centers _ ( in dynamical sense ) with the streamlines encircling the vortex centers .",
    "thus each limit cycle gives rise to a vortex in the flow field .",
    "therefore by theorems ( [ dulac ] ) , ( [ poin ] ) and ( [ poinb ] ) we conclude that number of vortices in the flow field must be finite .",
    "in existing literature , the occurrence of moffatt vortices has always been synonymous with the existence of an infinite sequence . despite the continuum hypothesis providing the base for the governing equations for incompressible viscous flows and the concept of kolmogorov length scale in vogue ,",
    "the issue of the finiteness of such sequence has continued to remain unattended . in an effort towards addressing this issue , firstly we have listed the concerns and the pertinent questions on the notion of infiniteness of such sequences and pinpointed where the assumptions of the existing hypothesis could have gone wrong .",
    "next , we have provided a concrete mathematical basis for predicting the correct physical phenomenon . in order to do so",
    ", we have quantified the centers of vortices as fixed points through brouwer fixed point theorem and further defined boundary of a vortex as a circle cell . with the aid of our newly developed theories and some existing ones , and clubbing them with elementary mathematical analysis , we proved that the number of vortices in solid corners in a bounded domain can not be infinite .",
    "we arrived at the same conclusion by analyzing the hypothesis through six different approaches .",
    "thus the sequence of moffatt vortices in fluid flows around solid corners must be finite .",
