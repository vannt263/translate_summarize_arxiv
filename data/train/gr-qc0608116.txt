    "in recent years , spin foam models @xcite have attracted much interest as a new implementation of the sum - over - histories quantization of gravity @xcite in a discrete setting and in a purely group - theoretic and algebraic language .",
    "spin foam models can in fact be understood as background independent discrete quantum gravity path integrals : spacetime ( and its topology ) is represented by a combinatorial 2-complex ( collection of vertices , links and faces ) and a possible configuration of geometric data is determined by a collection of either ( lorentz ) group elements or group representations assigned to its links or faces , respectively ; each geometric configuration is assigned a quantum amplitude ( usually , but not necessarily , derived via a discretization of some continuum formulation of classical gravity ) , and the partition function of the model is defined by the typical sum over all possible quantum configurations weighted by the chosen amplitude .",
    "the 2-complex is usually chosen to be topologically dual to a simplicial complex of the appropriate dimension .",
    "the situation as regards 4-dimensional quantum gravity in a spin foam context is still in rapid evolution , with various models being proposed and several issues still to be clarified @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the viability of a spin foam quantization of 3d quantum gravity is not anymore an issue , as it has been shown that the ponzano - regge spin foam model ( see for example @xcite ) provides , after suitable regularization , a well - defined and useful description of it , whose equivalence with other approaches , e.g. chern - simons quantization @xcite or canonical loop quantum gravity @xcite , can be established . moreover , spin foam models can be obtained from the perturbative expansion of group field theories@xcite , peculiar quantum field theories over group manifolds providing a kind of local simplicial third quantization of gravity , in the same way as the traditional path integral for quantum gravity can be obtained ( formally ) from the perturbative expansion of a suitably defined field theory on superspace ( space of geometries ) . in doing so , one obtains also a definite prescription for a sum over topologies , complementing the sum over geometries provided by the spin foam model ( gravity path integral ) alone .",
    "group field theories , as argued in @xcite , have a potential and scope that go far beyond that of spin foam models per se , that make them fascinating , and that have not been explored but to a very limited extent .",
    "+ the coupling of matter fields to quantum gravity can also be described in the spin foam setting @xcite . in particular , in the 3d case a precise description of quantum gravity coupled to point particles of any mass and spin was provided in @xcite , as a spin foam model , based on the classic work of @xcite , and in @xcite in the group field theory formalism .",
    "the basic idea behind the construction of @xcite is to treat feynman graphs of a generic matter field theory as quantum gravity _",
    "observables _ , and to obtain a description of the interaction of matter degrees of freedom and quantum gravity ones for each line of propagation from the analysis of the classical coupling of gravity and point particles , with the latter treated as topological defects of the former .",
    "this led not only to a definition of a spin foam model ( and later a group field theory ) for 3d quantum gravity coupled to matter , but also to the derivation of an effective non - commutative field theory for scalar fields @xcite ( and higher spin ones @xcite ) , whose feynman graphs amplitudes are given by the same quantum amplitudes of the coupled spin foam model , suitably re - written @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes for the matter feynman graphs obtained from the coupling with quantum gravity are , however , a bit peculiar , in that they make use of the hadamard propagator , instead of the feynman one , to describe the propagation of matter , i.e. they assign the same weights to the external and internal lines of the feynman graphs , and a rather ad hoc procedure is needed to turn these into the more conventional form @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted , as we are going to prove , as a result of a missing causality restriction on the _ quantum gravity _",
    "amplitudes one starts with , and that in turn leads to a non - causal propagation of matter degrees of freedom at the quantum level , once these have been coupled to gravity .",
    "+ motivated partially by this interpretation of the results of @xcite and mainly by general considerations on the role of causality in quantum gravity , and in spin foam models in particular ( articulated in @xcite ) , we set out to analyze thoroughly the issue of causality in the context of 3d spin foam quantum gravity , with and without matter coupling . while the issue we deal with is indeed very general , and we expect the ideas and techniques we use to deal with it to be general as well , the 3d setting leads to a particularly neat application of them , as we are going to see . + before presenting the details of our analysis and results , we feel it is appropriate to discuss first the role of causality in quantum gravity in the path integral formalism and spin foam models , and the general arguments for the need for a _ causality _ restriction on the histories summed over , and then the strategy for the coupling of matter fields to 3d spin foam models used in @xcite .",
    "this will clarify the context , the underlying ideas and the motivations of our work .      the path integral formulation of quantum gravity entails the construction of a partition function of the form : @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the gravitational einstein - hilbert action , for example , for a given spacetime manifold @xmath2 , and the integral being of course over all lorentzian geometries ( metrics up to diffeomorphism equivalence ) compatible with the given topology .",
    "the resulting quantity is in general a _ complex _ number and changes into its complex conjugate under reversal of the spacetime orientation @xcite .",
    "it also allows in principle for the computation of quantum gravity transition amplitudes ( using a canonical gravity terminology )    z(h_1,h_2)=_g h_1,h_2ge^is_m(g ) [ eq : path ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are 3d geometries induced by _ all _ 4d geometries @xmath5 on the two ( disjoint ) boundaries of @xmath2 ( corresponding to possible canonical quantum gravity _ states _ ) .",
    "the complex nature and symmetry properties of the above quantities under orientation reversal are the same as those of the partition function .",
    "it is obvious that , once defined more rigorously , the partition function and transition amplitudes would encode the full dynamics of the classical gravity theory at the quantum level , for any choice of spacetime topology @xmath2 .",
    "also , the above transition amplitudes would appear , in a third quantized formulation involving spatial topology changing processes @xcite , as the 2-point function ( analogue of the feynman propagator for a single particle ) associated to internal lines of any 3rd quantized feynman graph , confirming that it correctly captures the quantum gravity propagating degrees of freedom ( in the cosmological context of @xcite representing the degrees of freedom of the whole quantum universe ) .",
    "+ a sum - over - histories formulation of the dynamics is possible also in canonical quantum gravity framework .",
    "the dynamical content of the theory is encoded in the hamiltonian constraint operator @xmath6 and one relevant object to define for computing physical probability amplitudes , including transition amplitudes , is the inner product between physical states , i.e. solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation @xmath7 .",
    "one possible way to define such an inner product is in terms of matrix elements of a _ projector _",
    "operator from kinematical states onto physical states ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , to be thought of as some regularized version of @xmath8 . the sum - over - histories formalism may be used to provide a covariant definition of these matrix elements ( including the vacuum - vacuumone , equivalent to the partition function ) , and a covariant definition of physical wave functions ( satisfying all the quantum gravity constraints , including the hamiltonian one ) .",
    "the lagrangian path integral given above has then an hamiltonian counterpart in the case of @xmath9 topology , i.e. when a canonical decomposition of the variables is possible .",
    "it is given by    @xmath10.\\ ] ]    the ( formally defined ) integrals are over 3-metrics @xmath11 , their conjugate momenta @xmath12 , over the shift vector @xmath13 ( this integration amounts to the imposition of the spatial diffeomorphism constraint ) and over the lapse function @xmath14 .",
    "the choice of integration range over the lapse is crucial : the choice of the full infinite range @xmath15 provides us with the result we were aiming for , i.e. a covariant definition of the physical inner product between canonical quantum gravity states and thus of the projector operator .",
    "in fact the resulting quantity @xmath16 is a _ solution _ of the hamiltonian constraint equation in both its arguments @xcite , and it is a real quantity , as expected from the canonical inner product .",
    "however , @xmath17 _ does not _ correspond to the lagrangian path integral ( [ eq : path ] ) ; the reason is @xcite that positive and negative lapses correspond to the _ same _ class of 4-geometries , and the difference between the two half - ranges @xmath18 and @xmath19 is only that they correspond to _ opposite spacetime orientations_. in other words , the above quantity in lagrangian formulation is given by a different _ symmetric _ choice of quantum amplitude , but corresponds to the same set of 4d geometries being integrated over : g_h(h^2_ij , h^1_ij)=g ( e^is(g ) + e^-is(g ) ) [ eq : pathsym ]    a second choice is possible : one may choose to integrate only in the range @xmath18 to define : @xmath20.\\ ] ]    now , the resulting quantity @xmath21 is indeed _ equal _ to the lagrangian path integral and so it also captures the full dynamical content of the theory ; however , it _ does not _ satisfy the hamiltonian constraint equation in either of its arguments ; it is instead @xcite a green function for the hamiltonian constraint operator , satisfying @xmath22 .",
    "it defines thus a quantity analogous to @xmath23 .",
    "+ this apparently puzzling situation can be easily understood as arising from the difference between lagrangian and hamiltonian symmetries , the first being the 4d spacetime diffeomorphisms and the second being the transformations generated by the canonical operators @xmath24 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the second set of symmetries is actually _ larger _ than the first and in particular the range @xmath25 is perfectly symmetric under transformations of the lapse corresponding to 4d spacetime diffeos , while it is not under canonical symmetries that can connect positive and negative lapses , thus requiring a symmetric range @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , while the lagrangian path integral @xmath27 is fully symmetric under spacetime diffeos , it is _ not _ symmetric under the transformations generated by the hamiltonian constraint and one needs a further symmetrization ( [ eq : pathsym ] ) to satisfy the wheeler - dewitt equation . +",
    "another way to see what is going on is to realize that all this has a very precise analogue in the sum - over - histories formulation of the dynamics of a relativistic particle , with @xmath17 corresponding to the hadamard propagator , given in momentum space by @xmath28 , thus imposing the hamiltonian constraint equation @xmath29 , and @xmath30 corresponding instead to the feynman propagator , given in momentum space by @xmath31 , thus relaxing the same hamiltonian constraint at the quantum level .",
    "the restriction to positive lapses is a * causality * restriction @xcite in that it corresponds to imposing that the final 3-geometry @xmath4 lies in the causal future of the first @xmath3 , and imposes a timeless ordering between initial and final boundary data ; again , it has a precise analogue in the relativistic particle case , where it corresponds to a restriction on the particle proper time to positive values only .",
    "we want to stress once more another consequence of the restriction , which is the consequent relaxation of the hamiltonian constraint , or in other words of the classical dynamical condition in gong over to the quantum regime .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint fully encodes the dynamical content of the classical einstein s equations for the gravitational field ( just as it encodes the klein - gordon equations of motion for the relativistic particle ) .",
    "the need to relax this classical constraint is then understood as the need to allow for purely quantum histories , i.e. for virtual propagation .",
    "another way to put it is to say that quantum dynamics takes place * off - shell * with respect to the classical constraint .",
    "this is well - known of course in quantum theories of matter dynamics , but it seems not to have been fully realized in the context of quantum gravity dynamics .",
    "this is true , however , and accepted for interacting systems , as in quantum field theory .",
    "the relevance of these considerations for quantum gravity may be less obvious .",
    "there are , however , several reasons why we think off - shell dynamics has to be sought for also in quantum gravity , in other words why the hamiltonian constraint , and the corresponding symmetry , of canonical quantum gravity should _ not _ be imposed necessarily on quantum gravity states and why the dynamics should be allowed to take place off - shell with respect to it . without entering into much details , let us summarize them .",
    "one reason is the above mentioned wish to impose causality restrictions , or equivalently a notion of causal , timeless ordering among quantum gravity states in computing physical transition amplitudes .",
    "another reason is that , as we have seen , such a restriction from the hamiltonian perspective is * necessary * to construct a true sum - over - histories formulation of quantum gravity dynamics from the lagrangian point of view , i.e. a lagrangian path integral , fully diffeo - invariant , but with no extra symmetry being imposed .",
    "also , the inclusion in the formalism of spatial topology change by going to a third quantized framework @xcite involves indeed the inclusion of interactions among universes and here is where the covariant off - shell path integral appears as a weight for quantum gravity internal lines of propagation , again playing the role the feynman propagator plays in a usual qft .",
    "one may of course question the physical content of such a quantum cosmological framework , but even these doubts are solved by passing to the spin foam formalism . in fact , on one hand spin foam models are understood as providing a more rigorous definition of the path integral framework for quantum gravity , and thus all the previous considerations regarding causality restrictions and off - shell propagation apply to them as well . on the other hand",
    "they also accommodate rather easily the presence of timelike boundaries , thus providing a _ local _ realization of the sum - over - histories idea and thus evade worries about the physical interpretation of the quantum cosmology setting . finally ,",
    "the group field theory approach and the role of spin foam models within it realize also the third quantization idea in a discrete and local way , thus calling once more for the need for off - shell propagation of quantum gravity degrees of freedom and for _ causal spin foam models _ , by clarifying in which sense spin foam models deal with interacting gravity degrees of freedom , or better put , interacting _ building blocks of spacetime _ , that must thus be allowed to propagate off - shell .",
    "motivated by all of the above , the construction of such causal spin foam models was initiated in @xcite , continued and refined in @xcite and then in the group field theory formalism in @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the realization that current spin foam models , including the ponzano - regge model for 3d quantum gravity , possess the same symmetry under reversal of spacetime orientation that characterizes covariant realizations of the projector operator onto solutions of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this explains their providing real amplitudes , as opposed to the complex ones one would expect from a lagrangian path integral .",
    "all this is fine , and indeed spin foam models were first constructed exactly as a way to define in a covariant language the dynamics of canonical loop quantum gravity , but , as we said , there are several reasons why one needs to go beyond this initial , albeit important , goal . the mentioned symmetry , as appropriate given the discrete setting at the roots of spin foam models , is realized at the level of each dual face of the spin foam 2-complex , as a symmetrization between the two opposite orientations it can be given .",
    "this was noticed in @xcite for the 4d barrett - crane model together with a consistent way of breaking such symmetry and constructing a possible causal version of the same .",
    "this breaking was refined to a more elegant and general procedure based on the particle analogy , that could be applied to any spin foam model in @xcite , and finally in @xcite a generalized group field theory formalism was constructed , that allows for the derivation of causal spin foam models , as well as the usual ones , in any dimension and signature , and for a variety of possible quantum spin foam amplitudes . in this process , however , the link with the usual path integral formalism for quantum gravity ( continuum and discrete ) became less manifest .",
    "in this paper , we derive a causal spin foam model for 3d quantum gravity , that represents the causal counterpart of the usual ponzano - regge model , starting directly from a discretization of the continuum path integral for gravity in first order formalism , and providing a clear discrete counterpart of the continuum causal restriction on the lapse .",
    "one additional motivation for imposing a causality restriction on quantum gravity variables is that such a restriction may be in fact * needed * for describing the quantum off - shell causal propagation of matter degrees of freedom of interacting field theories , once these have been coupled to quantum gravity ones and more general spin foam models have been constructed .",
    "recall that one example of this is represented by the recently constructed coupled ponzano - regge spin foam model , as we have mentioned and that we are going to review briefly in the following .",
    "there are several reason one may expect this at a somehow heuristic level .",
    "first of all the dynamics of , say , a relativistic particle coupled in the hamiltonian context is encoded in the _ coupled _ hamiltonian constraint for gravity and particle , and it is hard to imagine a procedure ( and a motivation for it ) that would relax the particle part of it , producing the off - shell propagation coded in the feynman propagator , without affecting and relaxing constraints on the the pure gravity sector .",
    "second , the restriction on the particle side that gives the feynman propagator as opposed to the hadamard one is a restriction on the _ proper time _ of the particle , i.e. the spacetime length of the particle trajectory , which is intrinsically a gravitational variable / observable , and thus the imposition of such a restriction is best interpreted as a restriction on the range of integration of some gravity variables .",
    "even more generally speaking , the very notion of time ordering or causal ordering that is at the root of the definition of the feynman propagator for a relativistic particle , and of the time - ordered n - point functions of quantum fields , is in fact a _ quantum gravity _ notion , so it must find its origin in the appropriate causality restriction on the quantum gravity side .",
    "+ once convinced of these rather heuristic motivations , one naturally comes to expect that , conversely , a _ missing _ causality restriction on the quantum gravity side would imply an a - causaland ultimately wrong treatment of particle dynamics , in particular an a - causal propagation of matter degrees of freedom , once these have been coupled to quantum gravity in some spin foam model . from this perspective , then , an apparently puzzling and a rather disturbing feature of the coupled ponzano - regge model of @xcite looks instead natural and confirms the above motivations and expectations .",
    "the feature we refer to is the fact that , as we are going to see in a few more details in the next section , the feynman graphs for the effective field theory describing the matter degrees of freedom have hadamard propagators instead of feynman ones weighting their internal lines , and thus describe these degrees of freedom as being always on - shell , i.e. always solving the classical hamiltonian constraint / equations of motion .",
    "this also implies a sort a strong a - causality in the sense that no ordering of their arguments is encoded in the feynman amplitudes ( and correspondingly there is no difference between particles and anti - particles ) .",
    "this turns out to be true both at the non - commutative field theory level , encoding the full quantum gravity corrections to matter propagation , and in the no - gravity limit , when one indeed recovers a matter field theory in flat space but , as said , with hadamard propagators in place of feynman ones .",
    "this means that the result can not be attributed to any sort of quantum gravity corrections to ordinary matter propagation , but it has really its origin in some more basic feature of the formalism .    of course",
    ", having the hadamard propagator on each internal line , one can try to reconstruct from it the corresponding feynman propagator , and this is indeed done in @xcite .",
    "however , on the one hand this is necessarily a very ad hoc procedure and does not teach us much about the origin of this puzzling feature of the model nor about its meaning , and on the other hand it is not a _",
    "unique _ procedure in that many different functions representing the non - commutative version of the usual feynman propagator can have the same on - shell ( hadamard ) counterpart , because a generic p - dependent factor may become a constant function of the mass m only , due to the @xmath32 constraint being imposed , as we are going to see and discuss , and because such p - dependent factors may also disappear in the no - gravity limit , and thus such different non - commutative versions of the feynman propagator may end up having the same flat space counterpart .",
    "we will see in detail how our _ ab initio _ procedure solves all these ambiguities .",
    "the usual coupling of particles to 3d quantum gravity , _ plus _ the _ same _ causality restriction of the pure gravity case , automatically provides us with a well - defined causal version of the coupled ponzano - regge model , and with causal feynman amplitudes for matter fields , with a unique prescription for the non - commutative version of the feynman propagator , and one that of course has the right and expected no - gravity limit .    having presented the motivation for our work , let us now outline our results as we are going to present them . after a very brief review of the spin foam formulation of 3d quantum gravity coupled to matter fields ( section ii )",
    ", we will : 1 ) identify the correct procedure for implementing a _ causality _ restriction in the spin foam formulation of pure 3d quantum gravity ( section iii ) ; 2 ) construct explicitly the resulting _ causal _ spin foam model ( section iii ) ; 3 ) add matter degrees of freedom to it and construct a _ causal _ spin foam model for 3d quantum gravity coupled to matter fields . ]",
    "( section iv ) ; 4 ) show that the corresponding spin foam amplitudes admit a natural _ approximation _ as the feynman amplitudes of a non - commutative field theory , very similar to that obtained in @xcite , with the appropriate feynman propagators being used ( section v ) ; 5 ) show that this effective field theory , and its feynman amplitudes , reduce to the usual qft action and feynman amplitudes in flat space , as they should , in the no gravity limit(section v ) .",
    "we then conclude with some outlook on possible developments of the results we have presented .",
    "classical 3-dimensional gravity can be formulated in first order formalism as a bf theory .",
    "the dynamical variables of the theory are :    * an @xmath33 connection , denoted by a , which can be locally thought as an @xmath34(2)-valued 1-form ; * an @xmath34(2)-valued 1-form , denoted by e ,    and the action is given by :    @xmath35    for a generic spacetime manifold @xmath2 , where @xmath36 is the curvature of @xmath37 , thus a lie algebra - valued 2-form , and the trace is taken in the adjoint representation .",
    "the theory is quantized using the path integral method , i.e. by the partition function :    @xmath38    the spin foam representation of the theory is obtained by a simple discretization of the above classical and quantum theory @xcite ; of course , the discrete setting helps to a great extent in making mathematical sense of the above functional integrals .",
    "so , we introduce a triangulation @xmath39 , and its topological dual @xmath40 . keeping in mind that the geometric information of a simplicial complex is fully captured by the set of edge lengths , that the curvature is located on ( d-2)-simplices ( thus again along edges in 3d ) , and that @xmath41 is a 1-form , while @xmath42 is a 2-form , a natural way to discretize the variables is to do the following :    * integrate the e field along the edges of the triangulation , obtaining @xmath34(2 ) elements , one for each edge . *",
    "integrate the f field over the dual faces ( i.e. over the faces of the dual cellular complex ) , obtaining an @xmath34(2 ) element for every dual face ( dual to an edge of the triangulation ) .    given",
    "that , under any lattice refining , @xmath43 , a convenient but also appropriate choice is to define the discretized curvature @xmath42 through the holonomy around the boundary of the same dual face on which it is discretized , which in turn can be obtained from a product of parallel transports ( path - ordered exponentials of integrals ) of the fundamental connection @xmath37 along dual edges , that give in the end @xmath33 group elements .",
    "thus in the end @xcite a natural set of variables for the discretized theory is :    * an @xmath34(2 ) element for every edge e , denoted by @xmath44 . *",
    "an su(2 ) element for every dual edge @xmath45 , denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "the product of all the @xmath46 s corresponding to the same e in cyclic order , i.e. the holonomy around a dual face dual to the edge e , will be denoted by @xmath47 .    with this discretization",
    "the action above reads @xmath48    now , quantization is straightforward .",
    "the partition function is given by is needed in order to get a delta function over su(2 ) .",
    "this point was emphasized also in @xcite , to which we refer for more details .",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 parametrizes g ( see appendix a ) . ]",
    "@xmath51    the integral over @xmath44 in ( [ eq:3d ] ) can be performed as well as of the @xmath46 .",
    "] , to give : @xmath52    now the delta functions on the group can be expanded in irreducible representations using harmonic analysis on @xmath33 , and then the integrals over the @xmath46 can be performed as well , leaving us with the spin foam version of the same partition function @xcite :    @xmath53 where the quantity @xmath54 is the dimension of the representation @xmath55 labeling the edge @xmath56 of the triangulation , and the weight for each tetrahedron in the triangulation is given by the @xmath57-symbol , a function of the six representations labeling the six edges of the tetrahedron itself .",
    "this is the so - called ponzano - regge spin foam model .",
    "+ the coupling of matter fields is obtained , as anticipated , by treating a full feynman graph @xmath58 of a scalar field theory , with its hidden dependence on geometric variables , as a quantum gravity observable .",
    "the coupling between geometric and matter degrees of freedom at each line of propagation of the graph is obtained by a discretization of the continuum action describing the coupling of gravity to relativistic point particles in 3d , with the line of the feynman graph thus being interpreted as the trajectory of a relativistic particle in a 3d spacetime , and by the subsequent integration over particle data .",
    "one therefore introduces curves @xmath59 s embedded in the spacetime manifold @xmath2 , where @xmath59 is interpreted to be the worldline of the i - th particle .",
    "collectively , these curves make a 1-dimensional graph @xmath58 , interpreted as a feynman graph of a field theory .",
    "@xmath58 will often be called the particle graph below .",
    "the analogue of ( [ eq : bf action ] ) is then @xmath60\\ ] ] where , q is an @xmath34(2)-valued 0-form ( function ) and u is an su(2)-valued 0-form .",
    "@xmath61 is interpreted as the classical ( thus already on - shell ) momentum of the i - th particle and thus shall be denoted by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the mass of the i - th particle and g is the newton s constant .",
    "we shall use in this section units in which @xmath64 , and hence will call @xmath65 the mass as well , while it is in fact the deficit angle associated to the mass @xmath63 .",
    "we shall restore newton s constant to the equations in section v since we will be interested in the limit @xmath66 . ] .",
    "the equations of motion , which are obtained after varying the e and the q are @xmath67    the first equation means that the curvature is flat everywhere except at the locations of the particles where it has a conical singularity .",
    "the second equation means that the momentum of a particle is covariantly constant along its worldline .",
    "+ the full continuum partition function is now @xmath68    note that in the path integral we have something of the form @xmath69    the effect of the integral over @xmath70 s is then simply to impose equations ( [ eqnarray : momentum ] ) .",
    "however , as will be apparent in a moment , the discretization itself , if chosen appropriately , will impose these constraints .",
    "thus we shall drop the last term in ( [ eq : coupled full ] ) and discretize a slightly different but equivalent theory given by :    @xmath71    to discretize this action we , as before , introduce a triangulation @xmath39 and its dual @xmath40 .",
    "we insist , however , on a triangulation that is adapted to @xmath58 , i.e. the @xmath59 s coincide with some of the edges of @xmath39 .",
    "the discretizations of the e and a fields are given as before .",
    "the discrete analogue of @xmath62 is given by @xmath72 , the group element corresponding to the @xmath34(2 ) element @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that there is one u for each edge of @xmath58 , i.e. the discretized @xmath62 is constant along each edge of @xmath58 , thus satisfying ( [ eqnarray : momentum ] ) .",

    "hadamard propagators are _ not _ the correct way to capture the quantum dynamics of matter degrees of freedom , in particular they possess the wrong causal properties , and are _ not _ what comes out of the perturbative expansion of a qft for matter fields .",
    "the problem is , as we said , bypassed in @xcite by re - constructing a possible definition of the feynman propagator from the obtained hadamard propagator , and using this possible definition to reconstruct the non - commutative qft action that would originate the above feynman amplitudes .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , the reconstruction is highly non - unique , in particular because the definition of the hadamard propagator is non - unique : the insertion of any function of @xmath87 is turned by the delta function into an irrelevant insertion of a function of @xmath88 .",
    "also , the choice made in @xcite is natural and gives the correct result in the no - gravity limit , i.e. @xmath89 , but , again , it is clear that this limit does not constrain the initial choice enough to achieve uniqueness : any insertion of a function of @xmath87 that gives a constant in the limit does not affect the result .",
    "we will see how a correct _ ab initio _ derivation of a _ causal _ coupled model will solve naturally and uniquely all these difficulties .",
    "we want now to derive a causal version of the ponzano - regge model for pure 3d quantum gravity , starting from the discrete formulation of 3d bf theory reviewed above , and imposing on it the causality restriction that reduces the corresponding path integral to that of 3d quantum gravity , in lagrangian form . by deriving everything directly from the discretization of the continuum theory",
    ", we will avoid any sort of ambiguity ( apart those intrinsic to any discretization procedure ) and obtain a _ unique _ prescription for how the causal ponzano - regge model should differ from the usual one .",
    "let us now go back to the partition function : @xmath90 and its discrete analogue ( [ eq:3d ] ) :    @xmath91    another fruitful way of looking at it is to consider the action in ( [ eq:3d ] ) a discrete analogue of @xmath92    where @xmath93 are the shift and the lapse ; and @xmath94 are the diffeo and the hamiltonian constraints .",
    "this is almost immediate from ( [ eq:3ddelta ] ) , since after one integrates over the @xmath44 s one is left with @xmath95 s which are essentially imposing the constraints @xmath96 , or @xmath97 .",
    "this line of reasoning has been explored in detail in @xcite , and indeed it was verified that the above partition function imposes on the spin network states the diffeomorphism as well as the hamiltonian constraints .",
    "+ however , for reasons mentioned above , we do _ not _ want to impose the hamiltonian constraint . or , put differently , we want to obtain the _ causal _ analogue of the above partition function . at the lagrangian level",

    "before we perform such a causal modification of the ponzano - regge model , let us briefly review its symmetries @xcite . in the continuum , pr has two symmetries :    * the usual su(2 ) gauge transformations , given locally by @xmath101 and @xmath102 , where g is an su(2 ) group element .",

    "this is the reason for calling this symmetry rotational . *",
    "the translational symmetry has a more complicated expression @xcite , but essentially it is @xmath117",
    ".    it should be clear from the discussion in the introduction that the way to impose causality is to put some restriction on the @xmath113 integrations .",
    "this is because we would like to restrict the integration to positive triads , and triads correspond to @xmath113 s after discretization .",
    "obviously , a restriction to the positive triads will not affect the rotational invariance , since it is impossible to convert a positive triad to a negative one by a rotational gauge transformation .",
    "thus , the causal theory has to still be invariant under the rotational symmetry . on the other hand",
    ", the translational symmetry has to be broken , at least partially , since it is clear that one _ can _ go from positive triads to negative ones by doing a translational transformation ( just choose @xmath118 ) . + another way of looking at it is to say that we want to restrict to positive lapses only .",
    "now , comparing ( [ eq : gravity hamiltonian ] ) to ( [ eq : discrete action vector ] ) one could identify @xmath119 with @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the translational symmetry implies symmetry under @xmath123 .",
    "so , it is evident that there s no way to reconcile this with the fact that we want @xmath124 .",
    "+ so , how should we restrict the range of @xmath113 s , to implement the restriction @xmath125 , while keeping the rotational invariance ? before the prescription is provided , note the following four points :    * in the continuum , if @xmath126 then @xmath127 . hence ,",
    "if @xmath113 can be thought of as the discretization of a positive triad , then @xmath128 should be considered the discrete analogue of a negative one .",

    "* in the continuum , if @xmath129 then @xmath130 as well , for any @xmath131 .",
    "hence , if @xmath113 corresponds to positive triads , @xmath132 does so as well . *",

    ", this means that the lagrangian , switches sign as @xmath41 is deformed into @xmath135 .",
    "this implies that the lagrangian passes through zero , along the path of deformation. this implies that if we start from the discrete lagrangian and start deforming the @xmath120 , then as long as the lagrangian does nt vanish , we havent switched from positive triads to negative ones .",

    "the amplitude is _ not _ triangulation independent .",
    "although this may seem surprising , in fact it should be expected , since we are not on shell anymore .",

    "in fact , as a consequence of the non - analyticity , the action of the theory , in momentum space , which would have it as its free propagator , would be discontinuous across the point where the momentum is equal to the mass ( classical solution of the field equations ) . more precisely , the action switches from the one for a usual scalar field theory when the momentum is less than the mass , to an action of a nonlocal theory when the momentum is larger than the mass .",

    "of course , the main reason not to neglect it is that it follows directly and uniquely from the discrete path integral we have defined and computed , so it is a necessary part of the definition of a spin foam model for 3d quantum gravity .",

    "coupled to matter @xmath209    the properties of the above expression are very similar to those of ( [ eq : pure partition ] ) .",
    "in particular    * the amplitude is sharply peaked around the classical configuration , which is @xmath210 for @xmath211 , and @xmath212 for @xmath213 , in agreement with one s expectations .",
    "* it is clear that ( [ eq : full partition ] ) changes into the complex conjugate of itself , if one switches from integrating over the @xmath120 s that make a positive dot product with appropriate vectors to those which a make a negative product with those same vectors .",
    "this is precisely what one would expect from continuum considerations . *",
    "the model is not triangulation independent , essentially because the particle - free part of the amplitude is not .",
    "one can of course give a spin foam presentation of the above partition function .",
    "this is given by : @xmath214    the sum goes over all labellings of the faces of the dual two - complex by representations of su(2 ) . in the above @xmath163 denotes the usual 6-j symbol , and the @xmath215 s are given by :    @xmath216    the @xmath217 s can in fact be evaluated explicitly in terms of elementary functions ( which can be neatly repackaged into the hypergeometric functions ) , however what is important about them is that :    * for half - integer representations ( j is a half - integer ) , @xmath217 is zero .",
    "this is immediate from the fact that the integrand is odd in this case .",
    "* @xmath217 is manifestly real .",
    "+ because of these two properties , the sum of @xmath218 and its complex conjugate , i.e. the real part of the above coefficients , is simply given exactly by the character @xmath219 , so that the sum of the whole partition function with its complex conjugate gives back _ exactly _ the usual coupled ponzano - regge model , as one expects .",
    "this has to be compared with the proposal for the feynman propagator in @xcite , where such correspondence is realized only modulo proportionality factors ( functions of @xmath78 ) that are instead fixed uniquely from first principles in our procedure .",
    "it is very interesting to look at the quantum field theory ( abelian ) limit of ( [ eq : full partition ] ) , along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we turn our attention to this task now .",
    "we want to see now how ( [ eq : full partition ] ) compares to the evaluation of the usual feynman graphs in flat spacetime .",
    "this will imply first the re - writing of the above partition function , in the appropriate _ approximation _ , to be explained below , as the evaluation of the feynman diagrams of a non - commutative field theory that takes into account the quantum gravity induced modifications on the propagation of matter _ only _ ; second , it will imply checking that the same partition function reduces to the evaluation of the feynman graphs of _ ordinary _ scalar field theory in flat space in the no - gravity or @xmath89 limit .",
    "in other words , we want to concentrate on the matter part of ( [ eq : full partition ] ) and integrate out the gravity degrees of freedom . to do that note that by far the dominant contribution to the partition function from the no - particle edges , comes from the configurations which are flat on those edges .",
    "this means that , as far as the particle edges are concerned , the only contributions that are relevant are those for which the connection is flat everywhere except at the particle graph .",
    "of course , this is an approximation , we are replacing the fully quantum partition function , with the one in which gravity is flat ( classical , on - shell ) , everywhere where there is no matter . + to turn the above into formulas , note that action ( [ eq : classical coupled ] ) can be written as @xmath220    where @xmath221 stands of course for the metric .",
    "we have switched to the second order formulation to make the physical point more transparent .",
    "now , what we want to do is to approximate the partition function in the following way :    @xmath222    in the above @xmath223 and @xmath224 denote the metric that appears in the pure gravity or in the coupled part of the action respectively .",
    "@xmath225 is the minkowski metric . and @xmath226 were given in ( [ eq : traced ] ) . ]",
    "+ putting the above differently , gravity has a dual role in this model .",
    "it has independent ( only quantum ) degrees of freedom itself , and it couples to and deforms ( as we shall see below ) the matter action .",
    "what we want is to freeze the ( quantum ) dynamics of gravity for now and concentrate on the deformation it causes in matter propagation . + keeping the above in mind , we replace the pure - gravity amplitudes in ( [ eq : full partition ] ) with delta functions , obtaining factor . ]",
    "@xmath227    as we shall see below , ( [ eq : simple partition ] ) can be thought of as a feynman diagram evaluation of a noncommutative field theory . since we will be interested in taking the limit in which we recover the usual , flat - space qft , we must put newton s constant g back into the equations .",
    "+ to see where the g should go recall that , as was mentioned in section ii , @xmath78 is the deficit angle associated to the mass @xmath88 . more precisely ,",
    "comparison with the classical solution @xcite reveals that    @xmath228    thus we have to replace everywhere @xmath78 with @xmath229 .",
    "it is natural then to replace @xmath108 everywhere with @xmath230 , and interpret the equation above as an equation between momenta limit . ]",
    "@xmath231    this reinterpretation is clearest on - shell , but we will retain this interpretation off - shell as well , thus interpreting the gravitational holonomy corresponding to @xmath50 as the true quantum ( and thus off - shell ) momentum of the particle . as we have stressed above , this is of course consistent with what we know @xcite about quantum point particles coupled to 3d quantum gravity , as well as with our own results .",
    "so , we shall parametrize our group elements as @xmath232    the above parametrization is a very physically transparent one , and it is most useful for taking the @xmath233 limit . to get the noncommutative field theory , we shall use however a slightly different way of representing the group elements given by @xmath234 in doing so we have introduced the non - commutative momentum coordinates @xmath235 , valued in @xmath236 , the 3-ball with radius @xmath237 in @xmath81 , and @xmath238 are related by : @xmath239 ] previously mentioned in section ii and first used in @xcite .",
    "now , using the star product introduced in @xcite , given by @xmath240    and the fourier transform naturally associated to the above product(2 ) element , while @xmath241 are su(2 ) group elements . also , the minus in the exponent is purely a matter of convention .",
    "the choice here is made so that the formulas agree with those in @xcite . ]",
    "it can be shown , using the very same procedure used in @xcite , that ( [ eq : simple partition ] ) can be rewritten as as before is the number of the edges of the triangulation . ]",
    "@xmath243    the integrals over @xmath244 s give delta functions , enforcing momentum conservation at the vertices .",
    "the expression that one gets is    @xmath245    it is clear that the above expression has * exactly * the form of a usual feynman diagram evaluation , but in terms of the non - commutative momenta @xmath238 , i.e. for a non - commutative field theory that we are going to write explicitly in the following .",
    "it looks the same as the one obtained in @xcite , except for the integration measure over the @xmath238s , that is given here by an apparently usual @xmath246 , while was given by @xmath247 in @xcite .",
    "it is also important to notice that the fact that the ( noncommutative ) momentum is conserved follows here from moving from ( [ eq : full partition ] ) to ( [ eq : simple partition ] ) . in other words ,",
    "conservation of momentum is only valid when gravity degrees of freedom are frozen , and the dynamics of pure quantum gravity as encoded in the partition function ( [ eq : full partition ] ) is neglected and the partition function itself is evaluated at the dominant contribution ( flat spacetime ) only .",
    "this means that momentum conservation , even at the non - commutative level , is only _ approximately _ satisfied in the causal theory .",
    "inverting the expression for the feynman propagator used in ( [ eq : noncom partition ] ) , one can see @xcite that the action that generates feynman diagrams of the form ( [ eq : noncom partition ] ) is given by the following scalar noncommutative field theory action    @xmath248    the coupling constant @xmath249 has been introduced to make the action above look similar to the familiar @xmath250 theory .",
    "the position space version of this action is given by :    @xmath251   \\phi ( x )      \\big )    + \\frac{\\lambda}{3 ! } \\big (    \\phi \\star \\phi \\star \\phi   \\big ) ( x )    \\bigg ] \\ ] ]    where@xmath252 is the laplacian on @xmath81 .",
    "once more , the action differs , in both momentum and position space , from the one obtained in @xcite , due to the additional @xmath206 factor per edge that is present in our partition function , and necessarily so because it follows uniquely from the discretization of the bf partition function _ plus _ the causality restriction .",
    "we shall take now the @xmath253 limit of ( [ eq : simple partition ] ) .",
    "using the first parametrization ( [ eq : first param ] ) , it is obvious that integration over the group su(2 ) is replaced by integration over its lie algebra @xmath254 .",
    "@xmath255 where we use the notation @xmath256 .",
    "it is clear that with this definition , the group elements ( [ eqnarray : group element ] ) can be expanded in powers of @xmath257 as @xmath258    keeping the above in mind , and using the same techniques as in @xcite , in particular using the triangulation independence of the approximate particle - free part of the partition function , ensured by the use of delta functions over the holonomies of the connection , we see that the abelian limit of the full partition function ( [ eq : full partition ] ) is given by : @xmath259    the equation above is almost exactly the same as the expression obtained in @xcite with the sole ( welcome ) difference in that the amplitudes on the particle edges are the feynman propagators instead of the hadamard ones , i.e. ( [ eq : abelian limit ] ) is equal to the evaluation of the usual feynman diagram associated to the graph @xmath58 in flat spacetime for a scalar field . ) reduces to the usual scalar field theory action in the limit @xmath233 , since the star product goes to pointwise multiplication in this limit , and the derivative factor in the denominator of the kinetic term drops out .",
    "] we see that , as anticipated , the abelian limit of the causal coupled partition function is insensitive to the edge factor @xmath206 that marked the difference between the non - commutative feynman propagator as uniquely obtained from the causal restriction of the bf partition function and the one used in @xcite .",
    "let us also emphasize once more that the noncommutative analogue of ( [ eq : abelian limit ] ) , is _ not _ exactly the effective field theory coming from the full partition function .",
    "what it _ does _ correspond to is the theory in which instead of the @xmath260 factors for the particle - free edges , one has delta functions . in other words , it is the theory in which gravity is on - shell away from the particles .",
    "it is clear that the off - shell partition function ( [ eq : full partition ] ) is not exactly equal to the noncommutative field theory written above , because of the virtual gravity degrees of freedom present ) dependent on the triangulation chosen , and thus on extra information not contained in the feynman graph @xmath58 alone .",
    "this last point makes unlikely , in our opinion , although not ruled out that there exists a different non - commutative field theory that gives the full true partition function as the evaluation of its feynman graphs . ] .",
    "let us summarize our results .",
    "we have shown what is the correct discrete counterpart of the causality condition that reduces bf theory to 3d quantum gravity in the lagrangian setting , i.e. the restriction on the geometric variables that imposes on the one hand the correct dependence of the path integral on the spacetime orientation , and , on the other hand , realizes the correct off - shell ( with respect to the canonical hamiltonian constraint ) propagation of gravity degrees of freedom .",
    "we have constructed the corresponding _ causal _ spin foam model for pure 3d quantum gravity , and discussed its properties .",
    "we have then coupled matter to the model , along the lines of @xcite , and derived , through a rigorous discretization and evaluation procedure , a _ causal _ coupled spin foam model for 3d gravity and scalar matter ( the model can however be trivially extended to include spin degrees of freedom , whose coupling is not affected by the causality restriction ) .",
    "then , we have shown how the causal model admits a physically motivated",
    "_ approximation _ corresponding to approximating the integral over pure gravity degrees of freedom with its dominant contribution , represented by the flat spacetime geometry .",
    "this approximated model has then been re - written as the feynman evaluation of a feynman graph for a non - commutative scalar quantum field theory , encoding fully the matter degrees of freedom plus the quantum gravity corrections to matter propagation , while the un - approximated model encodes also the quantum gravity corrections to flat space momentum conservation .",
    "the amplitudes so obtained involve non - commutative feynman propagators , as one would expect .",
    "no ambiguity at all arises in re - writing the approximate partition function in terms of such feynman evaluations , and everything follows uniquely from the original discretization of the causally restricted partition function .",
    "finally , we have extracted , from the form of the non - commutative feynman amplitudes , the unique non - commutative field theory action producing them in perturbative expansion , both in momentum and configuration space . , and shown that both the action and the corresponding feynman amplitudes reduce to the correct usual feynman amplitudes for a scalar field theory in flat commutative space in the no - gravity limit .",
    "let us now conclude by mentioning only some of the many possible uses and further developments of the results we have presented .",
    "we can summarize what we have achieved as the realization , in a discrete context and in a spin foam language , of the path integral or sum - over - histories idea for 3d quantum gravity coupled to matter fields , in the lagrangian framework .",
    "one can then use this path integral for computing quantum gravity transition amplitudes and observables , being assured that the formalism correctly encodes causality and orientation dependence restrictions .",
    "however , it is maybe of more direct physical interest to compute the effects of quantum gravity corrections to matter scattering amplitudes , now that the unique and correct expression for the quantum gravity modified feynman amplitudes for matter fields have been derived .",
    "there are several reasons , however , for believing that only a group field theory context would render the use of the above amplitudes truly physically meaningful ( as far as 3d quantum gravity can be physically meaningful , of course ) .",
    "one obvious one is the triangulation dependence of the causal model , both for pure gravity and matter coupling .",
    "this triangulation dependence has to be expected , as we have discussed , since 3d gravity lacks local degrees of freedom only on - shell , i.e. only after the hamiltonian constraint has been imposed , that is what causality prevents us from doing , in a sense . on the other hand ,",
    "this triangulation dependence is still physically troubling , as it indicates that we can not restrict ourselves to a fixed choice of simplicial complex on which to define our theory , as this implies necessarily a truncation of the degrees of freedom that are captured by our model .",
    "the natural way to overcome this limitation , that is also the only known way in the physical 4d case , is to pass to a group field theory formulation , and to generate our spin foam model within a perturbative expansion of a group field theory that has the interpretation of a quantum field theory of simplicial geometry @xcite . on the one hand this would extend greatly the scope and context of our model , given that gfts include in their perturbative expansion a sum over different topologies as well as different triangulations and that at the same time point towards possible non - perturbative results as well @xcite . on the other hand , going to a gft context would first of all solve the issue with triangulation dependence , as we said , but also provide our causal model with an even more natural role . as we have discussed briefly in the introduction , in fact ,",
    "the need for an off - shellpropagation of quantum gravity degrees of freedom and thus for the un - symmetrized lagrangian sum - over - histories , as opposed to the symmetrized one realizing just the projection onto physical states , becomes absolutely apparent in a 3rd quantized context , i.e. that of a true field theory formulation of quantum gravity .",
    "this is exactly what is provided by the gft framework for simplicial quantum gravity and spin foam models .",
    "+ as mentioned , a proposal for a class of generalized group field theories , corresponding to _ causal _ spin foam models , in any spacetime dimension and signature , exists @xcite , and can be specialized to the 3d case in a rather straightforward manner . the first thing to check ,",
    "therefore , is whether our causal model can be seen as arising from this class of gfts .",
    "if it does not , the modification of the generalized gft formalism of @xcite that instead does the job should be sought for .",
    "having at hand such a gft model , the coupling of matter fields for it , along the lines of @xcite , has to be investigated . only after this , we think , we can truly start tackling physical issues on the basis of the causal model we have constructed .",
    "+ of course , true physics needs a 4-dimensional setting , and thus the main aim should be to work in the context of 4-dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "however , as it is well known , no consensus has been reached yet concerning the correctness of any specific 4-dimensional spin foam model , and the analysis of the proposed ones has still to progress past the initial stage .",
    "this is true also at the group field theory level .",
    "concerning the issues that have interested us in the present work , i.e. the issue of causality in quantum gravity , and in gravity coupled to matter fields , this is not really dependent on the spacetime dimension .",
    "therefore we expect our procedure and results to be of direct application and extension to any 4-dimensional spin foam model .",
    "in particular , if the 3d case can be handled successfully within the generalized gft context of @xcite , this would imply almost automatically that the same formalism is capable of implementing correctly causality restrictions in any dimension . much more work is also needed to understand the coupling of matter fields in the 4d context ; however , once again , our procedure and result would most likely be of direct application to any spin foam model of 4d quantum gravity coupled to matter that makes an explicit connection with classical continuum and discrete actions .",
    "an interesting testing ground would be , for example , the model for topological gravity coupled to string- and brane - like excitations investigated in @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank j. ambjorn , s. hartnoll , r. loll , j. ryan , and especially l. freidel and e. livine for comments and suggestions .",
    "here we collect a few facts about the group su(2 ) and its lie algebra @xmath34(2 ) that we used in the text .",
    "+ the basis for the lie algebra is @xmath261 , where @xmath262 are the pauli matrices .",
    "thus @xmath263    these obey @xmath264     & = & - 2 \\epsilon_{ijk } \\ , j_k    \\\\ & & \\\\ \\ { j_i \\ , , \\ , j_j \\ }   & = & - 2 \\delta_{ij } \\\\ & & \\\\ tr ( j_i ) & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from which it follows that @xmath265    the last equation has been used in converting the actions we dealt with ( ( [ eq : discrete action ] ) , ( [ eq : coupled discretized ] ) ) to vector form .",
    "+ using the exponential map , the general su(2 ) group element can be written as @xmath266    where @xmath134 is a unit vector , and @xmath50 is a real parameter which goes from 0 to @xmath111 .",
    "here we prove somewhat more rigorously equations ( [ eqnarray : distro2 ] ) and ( [ eq : distro2 ] ) .",
    "the proof and notation below are from @xcite . to begin with",
    "we define :    * a cone in @xmath81 , is a set c such that if @xmath267 then @xmath268 , @xmath269 .",
    "we shall restrict our attention to acute cones .",
    "the simplest definition for an acute cone is that which states that a cone is acute if its intersection with its inverse through the origin is empty . *",
    "the cone conjugate to c , is the cone @xmath270 such that @xmath271 if @xmath272 . *",
    "the tubular region @xmath273 associated to the cone c is the subset of @xmath274 , which is given by @xmath275\\ ] ]    we let c now be a very narrow cone along the z - axis",
    ". in other words in polar coordinates @xmath276 where @xmath151 is a small number ( which we will want to take to zero in the end , since what we want is the degenerate case in which c is just the z - axis ) .",
    "note that @xmath270 is almost the entire half - space with @xmath277 in this case .",
    "we claim that @xmath278 where @xmath279 .",
    "the integral over n can now be done giving ( [ eqnarray : distro2 ] ) and ( [ eq : distro2 ] )    the proof is very simple .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the left hand side of the equation above is a holomorphic function of z , and it is clear that the right hand side is holomorphic , because the denominator never vanishes .",
    "as is well - known , if two holomorphic functions agree on an interval , then they are equal everywhere .",
    "thus we will be done if we can show that there s an interval in @xmath273 along which the two sides of the equation are equal .",
    "we choose the subset of @xmath273 given by the purely imaginary elements , i.e. we let @xmath280 . then    @xmath281    doing now the integral over n , one gets @xmath282 \\frac{i}{z^3}\\ ] ]    which coincides with ( [ eqnarray : distro2 ] ) and ( [ eq : distro2 ] ) . + the left hand side of the equation above is called the cauchy kernel for @xmath273 .",
    "it is important to realize that for us , only the values for z whose real part is along c are the ones that are relevant .",
    "this is because our prescription of integration is dependent on z.",
    "here we show the riemann surface for the integrand in ( [ eqnarray : complex integral ] ) , and the contours leading to the feynman propagator . + the riemann surface for the function that we have , is a two sheeted one ( this comes from the square root , of course ) .",
    "there are two branch points , at 1 and at -1 . to obtain the surface ,",
    "imagine that one has two copies of the complex plane with a cut along the real axis joining the two branch points .",
    "in fact , to make things easier to visualize , imagine that we add the points at infinity , and consider two riemann spheres with cuts .",
    "then we should glue them in the usual criss - cross way typical of the square root riemann surface .",
    "it is easy to see that the surface obtained is topologically a sphere .",
    "+ the riemann surface for the @xmath283 that we have is shown in the first figure .",
    "the meridian that is closer to the viewer , corresponds to the copy of [ -1,1 ] which has negative square roots , while the one that is further away ( behind the sphere ) is the copy that has positive square roots .",

    "a somewhat more conventional picture of the contours is shown in the second figure . here",
