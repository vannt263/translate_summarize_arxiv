    "the method of qcd sum rule @xcite has become a powerful tool in studying hadron physics on the basis of qcd .",
    "it is a framework which connects physical parameters of hadrons to the qcd parameters . in this approach hadrons",
    "are represented by their interpolating quark currents taken at large virtualities and then correlation function of these quark currents is introduced . following this , on one side , the correlation function",
    "is calculated by the operator product expansion ( ope ) , and on the other side , its phenomenological part is constructed .",
    "physical quantities of interest are determined by matching these two descriptions at large virtualities via dispersion relations .",
    "the qcd sum rule method is discussed in many review articles ( see @xcite@xcite and references therein ) and successfully applied in studying various characteristics of hadrons .",
    "one of the important characteristic static parameters of hadrons is their magnetic moments .",
    "magnetic moments of nucleon were calculated in framework of the qcd sum rule approach in @xcite using external field technique .",
    "they were later refined and extended to the entire baryon octet @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present an independent calculation of the magnetic moments of the octet baryons in the framework of an alternative approach to the traditional sum rules method , i.e. , the light cone qcd sum rules method ( lcqsr ) . in the lcqsr method ope is carried out near the light cone @xmath0 instead of at the short distance @xmath1 .",
    "this is an expansion over the twists of the operators rather than the dimensions , as is the case in the traditional qcd sum rules .",
    "the nonperturbative dynamics is parametrized by the so called light cone wave functions , rather than the vacuum condensates used in the traditional qcd sum rules .",
    "a detailed description of this method can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are many applications of the lcqsr in the current literature .",
    "note that magnetic moments of the nucleon and decuplet baryons were studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , using the lcqsr method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the lcqsr for the magnetic moments of the octet baryons",
    "are derived . in section 3",
    "we present our numerical calculations and a comparison of the prediction of the lcqsr method on the magnetic moments of the octet baryons with the results of the other methods and experimental results .",
    "as we have already noted , in order to construct the sum rules for the magnetic moments of hadrons , it is necessary to introduce the correlation function of interpolating quark currents which have the same quantum numbers as corresponding hadrons . for this aim",
    "we consider the following correlator function : [ e1 ] = i d^4 x e^i",

    "the uncertainties in the results we have presented could be attributed to the variation of @xmath54 , borel parameter @xmath71 , twist3 photon wave functions which are neglected and errors in the input parameters such as @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath35 .",
