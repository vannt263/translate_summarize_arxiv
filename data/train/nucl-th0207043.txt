    "the structure of nuclei far from the @xmath9stability lines is often very different from that of stable nuclei due to largely extended wave functions as well as the large asymmetry between neutron and proton mean fields . because of these unique features of the mean field , a naive extrapolation of the @xmath9stable nuclei will fail to predict the structure of these exotic nuclei .",

    "special emphasis will be put on the magnetic and quadrupole moments ( q - moments ) for odd c isotopes which will manifest their exotic structure .",
    "electric dipole excitations of c isotopes are investigated by a large scale shell model calculations focusing on the interplay between low energy pigmy strength and giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) .",
    "we try to find out the deformation effect on the dipole strength distributions , which will increase the width of gdr .",

    "there is a difference in the case of @xmath46=16 .",
    "the present deformed hf+bcs result shows a spherical minimum for @xmath50c , while the amd model gives a triaxial shape for the neutron configuration . since the present deformed hf+bcs model is performed assuming the axial symmetric deformation , the two results are not completely equivalent",

    "since the spin and the parity of the ground state in @xmath2c is not established yet experimentally , we calculate the dipole strength excited from two possible spin - parity states 1/2@xmath41 and 3/2@xmath41 for the ground state . in case of @xmath6c ,",
    "effects of skin are studied .",
    "the neutron 1s@xmath143-orbit is obtained in a woods - saxon well to reproduce the experimental separation energy of 1.22 mev . the dipole strength enhanced about by 30@xmath139 in the low energy region around e@xmath129 = 5 mev .",
    "the skin effect is rather moderate .",
    "the nesw and ewsr of the transition strength b(e1 ) and the total photoreaction cross sections are listed in tables 3 and 4 . the dipole strength below gdr region becomes substantial in these nuclei , i.e. , the cross sections @xmath130 below @xmath135=14 mev exhaust 7.8@xmath139 for @xmath6c , 16.3@xmath139 for @xmath30c , 13.1@xmath139 for @xmath1c , 11.6@xmath139 for @xmath31c and 12.6@xmath139 for 1/2@xmath144 case of @xmath2c ( 14.1 @xmath139 for 3/2@xmath144 case of @xmath2c ) of the trk sum rule , respectively .",
    "these values correspond to 46.6@xmath139 for @xmath6c , 81.3@xmath139 for @xmath30c , 57.8@xmath139 for @xmath1c , 46.4@xmath139 for @xmath31c and 47.0@xmath139 for 1/2@xmath144 case of @xmath2c ( 52.4 @xmath139 for 3/2@xmath144 case of @xmath2c ) of the cluster sum rule , respectively .",
    "the gdr peaks with the isospin @xmath145 are found always at around e@xmath129= 17@xmath4819 mev in these nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath146 peaks appear more than 10 mev higher in energy than the @xmath145 peaks , and smaller in peak height in heavier c - isotopes . in the extreme case of @xmath2c ,",
    "the cross section @xmath130 of @xmath146 states becomes only 13.5% of the trk sum rule and there are only very small strength of @xmath146 states below e@xmath129=30mev .",
    "there are peaks at rather low energies 10 - 20 mev in @xmath147c .",
    "these energies are close to the unperturbed p@xmath0h excitation energy 1@xmath102(h.o.)=41/a@xmath148 mev in the harmonic oscillator model , but much lower than the systematic excitation energies of giant resonances @xmath3(gdr)@xmath14980/a@xmath148 mev .",
    "this low energy feature might be attributed to the effects of large deformations ( see table 1 ) , which makes some unperturbed p - h 1@xmath150 states lower than those of spherical nuclei .",
    "the main gr part have two peaks in @xmath6c and @xmath30c .",
    "this can be also considered as the effects of the strong prolate deformation as is seen in table 1 . in cases of @xmath1c , @xmath31c and @xmath2c , any clear two - peak structure",
    "is not seen in the strength distributions while the main peaks have large widths of @xmath15110mev .",
    "the strength distributions show not much difference between the case of spin 1/2@xmath41 for the ground state ( prolate deformation ) and that of spin 3/2@xmath41 for the ground state ( oblate deformation ) . as the strength around the peak up to 12 - 14 mev exhausts about 50% of the cluster sum rule value in the heavier c isotopes ,",
    "these regions may be interpreted as pigmy resonances .",
    "the strength is fragmented widely in the heavier isotopes , and the distinction between giant resonance and pigmy resonance seems not very clear except for @xmath6c and @xmath31c .",
    "we have studied the ground state properties of c isotopes by the deformed hartree - fock + bcs model .",
    "the shallow deformation minima are found in the several isotopes .",
    "the prolate deformation is suggested to favor for @xmath6c and @xmath1c while the oblate deformation is most probable for @xmath2c .",
    "both the prolate and the oblate minima appear in @xmath30c and @xmath31c to be almost degenarate in energy .",
    "the magnetic and the q- moments of odd isotopes are investigated by the shell model calculations , and their configuration dependence is pointed out .",
    "it is crucial to obtain experimental information on the values of magnetic and quadrupole moments to determine whether the deformation is prolate or oblate . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to find out decisive information on the deformation of @xmath2c since this nucleus is a keystone to establish the new shell structure at n=16 in the c isotopes .",
    "we have also studied the pigmy and gdr dipole strengths of c - isotopes by using shell model calculations in the large scale shell model ( 0p-1s0d-1p0f ) space .",
    "we found that the excitation energies of gdr in @xmath27c , @xmath35c and @xmath29c show good agreement with the experimental data of the two isospin resonances , t@xmath152 and t@xmath153 .",
    "moreover the calculated pigmy strength below @xmath15414 mev in @xmath29c is consistent with the experimental photoreaction cross sections . in heavier c",
    "- isotopes than @xmath29c , the t@xmath155 gdr has always a peak at around e@xmath129 = 17@xmath4819 mev , while the t@xmath156 peak is more than 10 mev higher in energy and much smaller in the cross section than the t@xmath155 one . in these heavy isotopes ,",
    "the pigmy resonances are more pronounced than that of @xmath29c , having about 8@xmath157 of the trk sum rule values , which correspond to 50% of the cluster sum rule values .",
    "future experimental effort is highly desirable to observe these pigmy resonances to clarify the structure of drip line nuclei@xcite .",
