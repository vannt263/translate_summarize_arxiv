    "the distance from the sun to the center of the milky way , @xmath0 , is a fundamental galactic constant for solving many astronomical and astrophysical problems ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "that is why , in its turn , the problem of determination of @xmath0 remains topical over many years .",
    "absolute ( i.e. , not using luminosity calibrations ) estimates of @xmath0 with a current 3% formal uncertainty from modelling the star s2 orbit around the compact concentration of dark mass , the so - called `` supermassive black hole '' , associated with the radio source sgr  a * @xcite present a major breakthrough in measuring @xmath0 ! ( for brevity , from here on the object in focus of s2 orbit will be referred to as `` sgr  a * '' . )    however , even though to take no notice the issue on coincidence of sgr  a * with the dynamical and/or luminous center(s ) of our galaxy ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , taken alone the modelling the orbital motion of a star near sgr  a * can be plagued with various _",
    "systematic _ sources of error . since @xcite   solved for the _ keplerian _ orbit of the star s2 , in the literature _",
    "relativistic _ effects and _ non - keplerian _ orbit modelling are primarily explored for this problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "meanwhile , @xcite  also used another _ assumption that the intrinsic velocity of sgr  a * is negligible_. this assumption can produce the source of systematic error in @xmath0 value owing to a probable motion of sgr  a * relative to the accepted velocity reference system which is arbitrary to some extent . thus far",
    ", no consideration has been given to the role of this factor in measuring @xmath0 .",
    "in this study , a simple analysis is used to evaluate the _ impact of an unaccounted motion of sgr  a * _",
    "( i.e. , the focus of s2 orbit ) _ on an @xmath0 value _ found from the formal solution of orbit .",
    "the keplerian dynamics only is taken into consideration because relativistic and non - keplerian effects seem to be insignificant for measuring @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been given to the impact of a nonzero radial velocity of sgr  a * relative to the local standard of rest .",
    "the completeness of solution of the problem in question is determined by the type of available data on motion of an individual star ( s2 ) .      in this case , _",
    "all six orbital parameters are solved , except that only the absolute value of the inclination angle , @xmath4 , is determined _ , leaving the questions of the direction of revolution ( prograde , @xmath5 , or retrograde , @xmath6 ) and where along the line of sight the star is located behind the central object unresolved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "besides , _ the semimajor axis is derived in angular units _ ( in arcsec ) , hereafter @xmath7 .",
    "the distance to the focus , i.e. , @xmath0 , and the central mass , @xmath8 , can not be solved .    with accepted @xmath0 , however ,",
    "the value of semimajor axis , @xmath9 , is calculated in linear units ( in kpc ) and the central mass is found from kepler s third law [ m ] m = n^2a^3/g , n=2/p , where @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , @xmath11 is the mean motion , and @xmath12 is the orbital period , as it has been done in @xcite .      in this case , _ the problem is completely solved _ if the value of star s radial ( line - of - sight ) velocity , @xmath13 , is significantly different from zero ( more exactly , from the radial velocity of the focus ) .",

    "@xmath13 _ determines the sign of @xmath4 . _",
    "consequently , this also breaks the ambiguity in the direction of rotation and in star s location along the line of sight relative to the focus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "b. _ the absolute value of _",
    "_ determines values _",
    "@xmath0 _ and _ @xmath8 . to gain greater insight into the fact of the matter",
    ", the problem can be symbolically divided into two subproblems : ( 1 ) the determination of orbital parameters from the proper motions alone and ( 2 ) the determination , knowing the orbit , of the distance to focus ( @xmath0 ) and of the central mass from the measurement(s ) of @xmath13 .",
    "these subproblems are almost independent in the case of modelling the motion of stars around sgr  a * , since up to now proper motion measurements are numerous , but @xmath13 ones are few or at all @xmath13 actually is single , for any s star with solved orbit .",
    "so , @xmath13 measurement(s ) contribute(s ) almost nothing to the knowledge of orbit , and vice versa proper motion measurements do not directly determine neither @xmath0 nor @xmath8 .",
    "thus , such breaking the problem down seems to be quite realistic .",
    "if so , the value of @xmath14 may be considered as determining @xmath0 and @xmath8 from known orbital parameters as follows .",
    "( * i * ) the orbit elements enable to find the ratio between @xmath14 and the total space velocity , @xmath15 , for the moment @xmath16 : [ vr / v ] v_r^2/v^2= , where @xmath17 is the eccentricity , @xmath18 is the true anomaly , @xmath19 is the argument of latitude , @xmath20 is the argument of pericenter .",
    "a value of @xmath18 can be calculated from classical formalism : @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the eccentric and mean anomalies , correspondingly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the knowledge of @xmath14 determines @xmath15 .",
    "( * ii * ) the value of total velocity @xmath15 can be expressed as [ v ] v = na()^1/2 . from this equation",
    ", the value of @xmath9 _ in linear units _ can be calculated .",
    "then the ratio between @xmath9 values in linear and angular units gives @xmath0 : [ r0 ] r_0=.    ( * iii * ) using eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) with @xmath9 in linear units determines the central mass @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite assume that the radial velocity of sgr  a * , @xmath26 , relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is zero .",
    "neglect of a possible radial motion of sgr  a * is equivalent to the introducing a corresponding systematic error in all @xmath13 values .",
    "this error is equal to a value of @xmath27 and is the same in all measurements of @xmath13 . from eqs .",
    "( [ vr / v])([r0 ] ) follows that the relative systematic error in @xmath13 velocity fully converts to the relative systematic error in @xmath0 , i.e. , [ delta ] _ = .",
    "these simple considerations make it possible readily to evaluate the systematic error in @xmath0 knowing typical values of @xmath13 used for the determination of distance to s2/sgr  a*. the first s2 radial velocity measurement of @xmath28  km / s by @xcite was obtained just 30 days after the star s passage through the pericenter point when @xmath13 was changing very rapidly .",
    "therefore , this measurement contributes to the solution for @xmath0 much less then subsequent ones , hence the evaluation of @xmath29 must lean upon these latter . besides , the subsequent radial velocities , having substantially higher absolute values , give a _ lower _ limit for @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite  justify neglecting all three spatial velocity components of sgr  a * mainly by low limits of sgr  a * s proper motion of 2060 km / s @xcite .",
    "such values of radial velocities seem to be quite plausible for massive objects in the galactic center ( see * ? ? ?",
    "table  [ tab_r0sys ] presents values of systematical errors in @xmath0 calculated for possible sgr  a * s radial velocities of @xmath30 and 60  km / s with @xmath31 and 8.0  kpc @xcite . in table  1",

    "notice that the value of @xmath29 can not be reduced statistically since _ all _ @xmath13 values is biased coherently by any nonzero velocity of sgr  a*. only solving for @xmath34 can correct this systematic error in @xmath0 !",
    "it should be mentioned that @xcite state that they already solved 3d velocity of sgr  a@xmath35 , however , not presenting in their short paper any details  no values of velocities and even no exact value of current point estimate for @xmath0 !",
    "the reference frame for proper motions @xcite  have established by measuring the positions of nine astrometric reference stars relative to typically 50200 stars of the stellar cluster surrounding sgr a * ; the uncertainty of the reference frame is 11.7  km / s ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of nonzero proper motion sgr a@xmath36 relative to this frame , @xmath37 , can be approximately estimated if to imagine that the value of @xmath0 is determined , also on the basis of @xmath13 s measurement at a moment @xmath16 , not from eqs .",

    "value of @xmath45 depends from the relative orientation of vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the general case @xmath48 . hence , e.g. , for equal radial and tangential components of sgr  a * motion , i.e. , for @xmath49 , or @xmath50 , _",
