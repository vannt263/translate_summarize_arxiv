    "among recent experiments supporting the possibility of lines of nodes in the gap function of some of the high - t@xmath6 materials @xcite , measurements on single - crystal yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath7 ( ybco ) show a linear temperature dependence of the penetration depth @xcite , as predicted for superconductors with lines of nodes in the clean limit @xcite .",
    "the density of states @xmath8 in such superconductors rises linearly with energy at the fermi level in zero field , which should result in a quadratic term @xmath9 in the specific heat @xcite .",
    "a material with a finite @xmath10 , such as a normal metal or a disordered superconductor with lines of nodes @xcite , has a linear term @xmath11 in the zero - field specific heat , with @xmath12 .",
    "g. volovik predicted that for a superconducting state with lines of nodes , the dominant contribution to the magnetic field dependence of the density of states at the fermi level is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the normal - state dos and @xmath15 is a factor of order 1 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath15 is defined by the vortex lattice structure , by the slope of the gap near the gap node , and by possible structure in @xmath14 . the quasiparticles which contribute to @xmath16 are outside the vortex cores , and are close to the nodes in momentum space . by contrast",
    ", it is usually thought that in a clean s - wave superconductor the quasiparticles are confined to the vortex cores @xcite .    in previous papers",
    "@xcite we reported measurements of the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat of twinned and untwinned single crystals of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath17 which were prepared identically to those showing linear temperature dependence of the penetration depth @xcite .",
    "these crystals have a linear term @xmath18 in the zero - field specific heat , a quadratic term @xmath19 which is only a few percent of the total zero - field specific heat , and an additional field - dependent linear - t term @xmath20 which obeys @xmath21 .",
    "two of these terms , @xmath9 and @xmath22 , agree quantitatively with the predictions of lines of nodes .    in this paper",
    "we summarize the previous analysis , including alternative fits , and present results on the sample dependence of the zero - field linear term , @xmath23 .",
    "we also discuss the physical origin of the @xmath4 dependence of the density of states and the prospects for observing this effect in a magnetic field applied parallel to the plane . in principle",
    ", measurements of the in - plane anisotropic magnetic field dependence of the specific heat could be used to map out the nodes .",
    "the specific heat was measured using a relaxation method described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the sample was mounted on a sapphire substrate with a weak thermal link ( thermal conductance @xmath24 ) to a constant - temperature copper block .",
    "at each temperature and field , @xmath24 was measured by applying power @xmath25 . a smaller temperature difference",
    "was then used to make a relaxation measurement of the thermal time constant @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the total heat capacity .",
    "the precision of the measurement in the temperature range 210 k is @xmath28",
    ". the addenda heat capacity can be as high as half of the total heat capacity , limiting the absolute accuracy in some measurements to @xmath29 .",
    "the addenda specific heat is mostly due to phonons , so that most of the systematic uncertainty effects only the debye @xmath30 term",
    ". measurements of an empty substrate showed that the addenda heat capacity does not depend on the applied magnetic field within the precision of the data .",
    "the accuracy of the field dependence of the specific heat is better than @xmath31 .",
    "all of the samples are single crystals of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 grown by the same flux - growth technique @xcite as crystals which show linear temperature dependence of the penetration depth @xcite .",
    "results have been obtained on two nominally pure , twinned single crystals ( samples t1 and t2 ) .",
    "a 0.8 mg piece was cleaved from one of the twinned crystals , sample t1 , and detwinned to create sample u1 .",
    "about @xmath32 of the surface of sample u1 , near two of the corners , had a high density of visible twins remaining after the detwinning process .",
    "sample t2 was mostly detwinned to create sample u2 , which had visible twin boundaries remaining .",
    "both u1 and u2 were reoxygenated subsequent to detwinning .",
    "figure [ fig : totalcp ] shows the specific heat of sample t1 in an 8 tesla field applied either parallel or perpendicular to the copper oxide planes .",
    "the total specific heat includes the debye phonon contribution , @xmath30 , which has a similar value in all three data sets ; the zero - field linear term @xmath23 , which appears as a finite intercept on the c / t - axis ; a magnetic contribution from spin-@xmath33 particles , @xmath34 , which appears as a low - temperature bump peaking around 3 - 4 kelvin in both parallel and perpendicular fields ; and a substantially increased linear term in perpendicular field , @xmath20 .      to model the perpendicular field dependence ,",
    "identical analyses are performed on data from samples t1 ( h = 0 , 0.5 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 tesla ) and u1 ( h = 0 , 0.5 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 tesla ) .",
    "a global fit is used to constrain the concentration of spin-@xmath33 particles , @xmath35 , and the phonon specific heat , @xmath30 , to be field - independent . allowing for the possibility of a small quadratic term , @xmath9 ,",
    "as predicted for lines of nodes , the zero - field specific heat is described by : @xmath36 the specific heat for @xmath37 t is described by : @xmath38 where @xmath39    all data sets are fit simultaneously to equations [ eq : zero ] , [ eq : h ] , and [ eq : schottky ] with a land g - factor of @xmath40  @xcite . thus , @xmath41 and @xmath35 are constrained by multiple data sets , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are constrained by the zero - field data , and @xmath44 is allowed a different value at each field .",
    "the statistical confidence levels are determined by a bootstrapping technique @xcite , in which alternative data sets are randomly chosen from the original data set and the fitting procedure is repeated .",
    "this procedure for determining the statistical error bars avoids making any assumption about the statistical error distribution of the data set .",
    "the parameters determined from this fit are shown in table  [ table : global ] , with @xmath45 statistical confidence levels .",
    "the coefficient of the schottky anomaly , @xmath35 , indicates @xmath46 spin-@xmath33 particles per copper .",
    "the coefficient of the debye term , @xmath47 , corresponds to a debye temperature of 400 k. the difference in the debye term between the two samples is within the systematic error of the debye term of the addenda .",
    "the rms deviation of the data from the fit is @xmath48 for t1 and @xmath49 for u1 .",
    "the higher scatter in the data for the untwinned crystal u1 results from the smaller sample size .",
    "the data and fits for both samples are shown in figure [ fig : fits ] , with the phonon specific heat ( @xmath30 ) subtracted .",
    ".global fit parameters ( mj , mol , k , and t ) [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : samples ]",
    "the quadratic term is predicted to disappear in a magnetic field , where the energy dependence of the density of states close to the nodes , @xmath50 , is replaced by a finite @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath9 term is comparable in magnitude to the systematic uncertainty in the addenda @xmath51 phonon specific heat , but is several times larger than the relatively small systematic uncertainty of the field dependence , @xmath52 .",
    "the global fit is thus the only possible way to identify the quadratic term in these data sets .",
    "the slight positive slope of the zero - field data set in figure  [ fig : fits ] can be described either as a phonon term which is about @xmath53 larger in zero field , which is difficult to explain , or as an @xmath9 term .    from the slope of the density of states in a superconductor with lines of nodes it is possible to predict @xmath54 for ybco within factors of order unity  @xcite , in good agreement with the value @xmath55 obtained from the global fits ( table  [ table : global ] ) on samples u1 and t1 .    for the field dependence of the density of states ,",
    "volovik predicts @xmath56  @xcite , where @xmath15 is of order 1 and is defined by the vortex lattice structure , by the slope of the gap near the gap node , and by possible structure in @xmath14 .",
    "taking @xmath57  @xcite and @xmath58 gives the prediction @xmath59 with @xmath60 , in good agreement with the value @xmath61 found for both samples u1 and t1 .",
    "both of the above comparisons used the measured value of @xmath62 , the angular averaged normal state density of states . because both the @xmath9 and @xmath63 terms are a consequence of the nodes , these terms should be sensitive to the normal - state density of states close to the nodes . the above comparisons may indicate that the density of states close to the nodes is smaller than the angular average of the density of states , as indicated by photoemission measurements on bscco @xcite .    these predictions do not distinguish between different types of lines of nodes , such as d - wave or extended s - wave @xcite . in principle , this interpretation could also apply to a gap function with no nodes , but with a very small minimum gap , @xmath64 .",
    "in order to produce these results , such a gap function would need to have an unusual energy dependence of the density of states similar to that associated with lines of nodes , @xmath65 .",
    "a quadratic @xmath66 term has been known for some time in the specific heat of heavy - fermion superconductors , and has recently been reported in the specific heat of la@xmath67sr@xmath68cuo@xmath69 @xcite .",
    "two other recent works support the existence of a @xmath4 term in superconductors with lines of nodes : a reanalysis of existing data on polycrystalline ybco samples shows a nonlinear @xmath70 t term which appears consistent with @xmath4 @xcite , with similar but less dramatic curvature on ca- and sr - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath69 samples , and a @xmath4 term has also been recently reported in the low - temperature specific heat of upt@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the total residual density of states @xmath10 in the superconducting state , as determined from the @xmath71 term in the specific heat , is about @xmath72 of the normal - state density of states for the twinned samples and about @xmath73 for the untwinned samples ( table  [ table : samples ] ) .",
    "the residual density of states can also be extracted from fitting the temperature dependence of the penetration depth @xcite to the d - wave model with scattering of hirschfeld _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in samples similar to the samples measured here , these fits are inconsistent with a density of states which is greater than @xmath31 of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "it appears difficult to reconcile the zero - field linear term @xmath23 with the @xmath9 and @xmath74 terms , and with the interpretation of the temperature dependence of the penetration depth .",
    "it is possible that the zero - field linear term has a separate origin from the excitations which give rise to the quadratic term and the field dependence of the specific heat .",
    "this assumption leads to a self - consistent analysis of the specific heat , and is given additional support by the measurements on the untwinned crystal u1 , in which @xmath75 is decreased substantially but the @xmath9 and @xmath74 terms are unchanged within statistical error bars .",
    "conventional high-@xmath15 superconductors are expected to have a linear - t term in the specific heat which is proportional to the volume of normal material in the cores , @xmath77  @xcite , and such an @xmath78 term has been observed in a15 superconductors  @xcite . the analysis which predicts this @xmath78 term does not apply to cuprate superconductors for two reasons .",
    "first , the small coherence length of the cuprates may result in a large excitation gap for quasiparticles which are confined to the vortex cores @xcite .",
    "secondly , caroli , degennes , and matricon @xcite assumed a fully gapped superconductor in showing that the quasiparticle excitations are confined to the vortex core .",
    "some form of a linear - h term might be expected in the specific heat for any excitations which are confined to the vortex cores .",
    "although there may in principle be some dependence of the core excitations on magnetic field , it is likely that for @xmath79 the core excitations would be roughly independent of field .",
    "thus , any signal resulting from these excitations would simply be proportional to the number of cores , or linear in h. the nonlinear field dependence of the observed @xmath16 suggests excitations outside the vortex core .",
    "the physical origin of the density of states predicted by volovik @xcite is the same as the physical origin of the depairing current in a conventional superconductor . in the presence of a supercurrent with velocity @xmath80",
    ", the quasiparticle excitation spectrum @xmath81 is shifted by an amount @xmath82 .",
    "far from the vortex core in a fully gapped superconductor , this shift is not large enough to change the density of states at the fermi level , which is given by @xmath83 for a superconductor with lines of nodes , the shift is significant everywhere that the superfluid velocity is not zero . assuming a vortex superfluid flow @xmath84 , the local density of states at the fermi level also falls off as @xmath85 ( figure [ fig : vortex ] ) . integrating over an entire vortex , with the intervortex spacing @xmath86 as the upper cutoff in the integral , gives a density of states per vortex @xmath87 .",
    "multiplying by the number of vortices , which is proportional to @xmath88 , then gives the total density of states @xmath89 .",
    "the shift in the excitation spectrum depends on the angle between the local superfluid velocity and the nodes , giving the vortex the same symmetry as the gap ( figure [ fig : vortex ] ) .",
    "because the nodes are @xmath90 apart , the superfluid velocity can never be perpendicular to all nodes , and there are no places where @xmath10 becomes zero . both the density of states , and in a clean system the anisotropy in the density of states , extend throughout the entire vortex .",
    "b. parks _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have pointed out that their measurements of vortex dynamics in ybco thin films are best explained by the presence of the extra quasiparticles expected for a vortex with an anisotropic gap .",
    "recent theoretical work suggests that the structure of the vortex core in a d - wave superconductor is both interesting and complicated  @xcite .",
    "we have deliberately omitted the core region from figure  [ fig : vortex ] , since we are not aware of any model for the core which suggests that our measurements are probing the core states .",
    "because @xmath16 depends on the orientation of the current with respect to the nodes , improved measurements of the full angular dependence @xmath91 should be sensitive to the positions of the nodes .",
    "define the orientation of the applied field @xmath92 as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the polar angle measured with respect to the c - axis and @xmath95 is the azimuthal angle measured with respect to the ( 110 ) crystalline axes . for tetragonal @xmath96 symmetry with antinodes along the cu - o bonds",
    ", @xmath97 corresponds to a field parallel to a node ( figure [ fig : nodes ] ) . in this orientation , @xmath98 , the currents in the ab - plane",
    "are flowing parallel to a single node .",
    "the density of states at the fermi level is @xmath99 larger at @xmath100 , where the currents flow parallel to the antinodes ( figure [ fig : nodes ] ) : in this orientation , the density of states picks up contributions from all of the nodes .",
    "the complete in - plane angular magnetic field dependence of the density of states is given by    @xmath101    as shown by volovik @xcite .",
    "using @xmath102 and taking @xmath103 as an experimentally accessible field , the field - dependent linear term @xmath104 will vary from 0.7 to 1.0 mj / molk@xmath105 as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath95 .",
    "this predicted angular dependence of the linear term in the specific heat may be within achievable experimental resolution , although preliminary measurements at 8 tesla on a heavily twinned sample with the field parallel to the twins and at a @xmath106 angle to the twins did not detect any angular variation in @xmath104 .",
    "the residual density of states at the fermi level in the superconducting state of single - crystal yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath7 , @xmath107 , is determined by the zero - field linear term @xmath108 in the specific heat .",
    "@xmath107 is qualitatively larger than would be expected from fitting the temperature dependence of the penetration depth  @xcite to expressions for lines of nodes with scattering  @xcite . in two twinned single crystals , @xmath109 , while in two untwinned single crystals , @xmath110 .",
    "the specific heat also includes a @xmath111 term , which obeys @xmath112 as predicted for superconductors with lines of nodes in the gap function  @xcite .",
    "this nonlinear field dependence of the density of states suggests quasiparticle excitations outside the vortex core , and appears to be independent of twinning , unlike the zero - field linear term .",
