    "icy mantles on dust grains have been long detected in cold and dense regions of the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "these mantles are the result of the accumulation of heavy molecules on grain surfaces due to the low temperature and high density conditions of the environment .",
    "the collisions between the dust grains and the neutral component of the gas lead to the retention of the gas phase particles on the grain surface , because their thermal energy is lower than the typical adsorption energies and because the excess kinetic energy can be transferred rapidly to the surface @xcite .",
    "calculations have shown @xcite that @xmath4100% of the collisions result in retention , depending on the species and the nature of the surface . moreover",
    ", the widespread detection of molecular mantles in dense regions of molecular clouds indicates a high efficiency of the sticking of heavy atoms and molecules on the surfaces of cold dust grains .",
    "the main observed component of the mantles is water ice @xcite , but it is thought that most of the gaseous species heavier than h@xmath0  or he will adsorb onto the grains and will disappear from the gas - phase , changing its chemistry , in a relatively short `` freeze - out '' time . the freeze - out rate is @xmath1 years @xcite , where @xmath5 is the total hydrogen nucleon number density . for densities as low as @xmath6  @xmath7 , _ the freeze - out timescale is much less than the expected lifetime of a typical molecular cloud ( @xmath8 yr ) _ , so it would be expected that , contrary to the observational result , the majority of observations would not show evidence for heavy gas - phase species .",
    "@xcite showed that for non - zero sticking efficiency , when no desorption processes act to remove mantle material , the accretion of gas - phase species on to the dust dominates the chemical evolution and the total freeze - out of gas is inevitable .",
    "thus , some mechanism is preventing the growth of mantles in grains and maintains an equilibrium between molecules in the gas and solid phases by producing the desorption of molecular species from the surface of dust grains .",
    "the finding of a convincing desorption mechanism that explains the observed molecular gas - phase abundances has proved to be rather elusive in the last 20 years .",
    "it is not yet precisely known how this desorption takes place and several different continuous desorption processes have been proposed , either working simultaneously or separately @xcite :    * classical thermal evaporation @xcite , which is negligible at the temperatures of dense clouds , @xmath9  k * desorption by direct impact of cosmic rays ( or x - rays ) onto grains , which causes local heating that lead to the evaporation of weakly bound molecules , such as co @xcite * cosmic ray - induced photo - desorption @xcite * exothermic mantle reactions , such as the formation of h@xmath0 , which can result in a local `` hotspot '' heating of the grain mantle @xcite * grain - grain collisions or chemical explosions @xcite ; grain - grain collision or sputtering in interstellar shocks @xcite * if the cloud is composed of clumpy molecular gas layers , interstellar uv radiation can penetrate two or three times deeper than in the case of a homogeneous cloud and can produce orders of magnitude more photo - ionisation and photo - desorption even at modest extinctions , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the feedback from the star formation processes , which eventually disrupt the dense cores from which stars form , will also limit the growth of ice mantles or force the return of the adsorbed species to the gas phase , in a sporadic or intermittent manner , through a variety of mechanisms : by sublimation of icy mantles from warm grains near bright stars in a more or less gradual way @xcite , by destruction or sputtering of grain cores and mantles by passing shocks @xcite , or by ice sublimation due to uv radiation originating in shocks @xcite .",
    "all the mechanisms above are not mutually exclusive , but no proposed non - thermal mechanism convincingly explains the presence of molecules such as co in dark clouds or it is widely accepted as a reliable desorption mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose to explore another possible mechanism : the consequences of the variation of the adsorption energies due to the different properties of the substrate and , in particular , the effect that the coating of dust grains by molecular hydrogen has on the evaporation rates of adsorbed molecules .",
    "once a molecular species sticks to a grain , the time it stays on the surface before it evaporates depends on the surface temperature and the binding ( adsorbing ) energy of the adsorbate species on a given substrate . the desorption rate , in  s@xmath11 ,",
    "is described by @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the surface temperature of the grain , @xmath14 the adsorption energy in k , and @xmath15 is the characteristic vibrating frequency for the adsorbed species , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the surface density of sites ( @xmath18  @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 is the mass of the adsorbing particle . typically @xmath21@xmath22",
    "the adsorption energies , @xmath14 , of molecules onto the grains depends on the properties of the substrate .",
    "table  [ table_ed ] shows the adsorption energy , in k , of several fundamental species on different substrates that can be found in molecular clouds .",
    "table  [ table_ed ] also shows the evaporation time expected for each adsorption energy for two relatively close grain surface temperatures , @xmath23 and 15  k. it is easily visible the large differences between the different molecular species and substrates and the influence of temperature .",

    "h@xmath0  is the most abundant gas - phase species in molecular clouds and several authors have long suspected that it could be an important component of the grain surfaces @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the adsorption energies of h@xmath0  indicate that it is a rather volatile molecule .",
    "table  [ table_ed ] shows that the evaporation time for h@xmath0  on h@xmath0o  ice can go from a few seconds at a grain surface temperature of 15  k to 0.5 years for 10  k.    the surface coverage of h@xmath0  molecules will depend on the balance between their evaporation and accretion rates .",

    "given the possibility that grains in molecular clouds are covered by a layer of h@xmath0  molecules and , as table  [ table_ed ] shows , this can greatly reduce the adsorption energies of heavy molecules , it is relevant to explore how much do the changes in the adsorption energies used in the chemical models change the values of molecular depletion in the gas .",
    "we used our gas - grain chemical model based on the gas - grain chemistry of @xcite to explore the evolution of gas- and solid - phase abundances of species after assuming that the grains are coated with h@xmath0  molecules .",
    "the chemical model contained 3768 gas and surface reactions involving 503 species , but we only took into account adsorption and evaporation of species from the grain surfaces , with no other chemical reaction on them apart from the formation of h@xmath0 .",
    "we ran several models at different gas densities ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75  @xmath7 , at a gas and dust temperature of 10  k , and cosmic ray ionisation rate @xmath76  s@xmath11 .",
    "all models used initial elemental ` low metal ' atomic abundances @xcite .",
    "we assumed a crude approach to simulate the effects of the coating of grains by h@xmath0  molecules and the subsequent modification of the adsorption energies , @xmath14 .",
    "we ran three different sets of models : a fiducial one with no modification of @xmath14 , and two models where all @xmath14 , except for h , h@xmath0 and he , were reduced by either a factor of 1/2 or 1/3 , a conservative value still far away from the scaling factor used by @xcite to estimate the change in the adsorption energy of molecules landing on h@xmath0-coated grains .",
    "figure  [ fig_models ] shows the results for two different number densities , @xmath77 and @xmath75  @xmath7 , and three different sets of adsorption energies : standard values , 1/2 of the standard @xmath14 values , and 1/3 of the standard @xmath14 values .",
    "the upper row of fig .  [ fig_models ] shows the results of the fiducial case . for a gas density of @xmath73  @xmath7 ,",
    "the gas - phase molecular abundances begin to suffer from depletion at a few times @xmath78 yr , at which point the gas and grain - phase abundances are approximately similar , and most of the molecular species disappear from the gas - phase at a few times @xmath79 yr .",
    "this effect is accelerated by about a factor of 10 for a higher density , @xmath75  @xmath7 .    the middle row of fig .",
    "[ fig_models ] shows the results of the case where the adsorption energies are half of the standard values .",
    "there is still some degree of depletion ( larger than 90% ) for some molecules , at a density of @xmath73  @xmath7 , but total depletion is never reached .",
    "some molecules , such as nh@xmath42 , do not have so high a depletion and the gas - phase abundance remains higher than the solid - phase abundance at all times .",
    "the level of depletion is much larger for higher densities , but even in this case there is not an almost total disappearance of the gas - phase molecules as in the standard case . on the other hand , the times when the solid - state abundances become larger than the gas - phase abundances do not seem to change that much .",
    "the case where the molecular adsorption energies have been reduced by a factor of 3 ( bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig_models ] ) shows the more dramatic changes .",
    "many molecules , such as co , cs ( prime candidates for depletion ) or nh@xmath42 , show little or insignificant depletion , even at high densities , measured as the fraction of molecules in the gas and solid phases .",
    "this is not the case for cn , which still shows high depletion in this case",
    ". one must be cautious in this case , though , because the presence of co in the gas at all times clearly affects the abundance of many molecules , such as cn and n@xmath0h@xmath80 .",
    "we have shown how the modelling of the depletion of heavy molecular species in dense and cold regions of molecular clouds depends on the determination of accurate adsorption energies , @xmath14 .",
    "different values of @xmath14 affect the time molecular species reside on the grain surfaces and can provide a way to help explain the non - complete freeze - out of molecules from the gas phase .",
    "in particular , we argue that the adsorption energies of molecules on a substrate of h@xmath0  ice can be several times lower than the ones commonly used in current chemical models .",
    "we also showed that h@xmath0  could occupy all the available grain sites in a relatively short time , @xmath64 yr , which could produce a change in the adsorption rates of molecules on grain surfaces .",
    "we ran a few simple gas - grain models to test how much relatively small changes in the adsorption energies of molecular species affect the gas - phase abundances .",
    "we find that if we use values of @xmath14 half of the standard values , the depletion of most of the molecules is greatly reduced , although it is still at levels of a factor of 10",
    ". a further reduction of the molecular adsorption energies , down to a factor of @xmath81 , which would be a conservative value of how much the adsorption energies can be changed , shows that molecules show very little or no depletion even at relatively high densities , @xmath75  @xmath7 .",
    "thus , lower evaporation energies of heavy molecular species due to the coating of grains by h@xmath0  molecules may explain the presence of co and other heavy molecules in the gas in average dark clouds .    as we indicated in sect .  [ coating ] , we do not expect to have more than one monolayer of h@xmath0  molecules due to the almost instantaneous evaporation of any h@xmath0  landing on h@xmath0-ice ( see table  [ table_ed ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we estimate that a co molecule landing on a grain completely covered by h@xmath0  will be able to scan the @xmath67 sites on the surface of the grain in a time , @xmath82 s , much shorter than the expected evaporation time , @xmath83(co ) @xmath84 min .",
    "if the grain surface is only partially covered by h@xmath0-ice , the effect will be that any co molecule landing on h@xmath0-ice will be able to find a free site outside of the h@xmath0-ice , at which point it will remain trapped on the surface .",
    "this will reduce the number of available sites to be covered by h@xmath0  molecules by about 500 in a year , as we expect about one co molecule landing on the surface per day at a gas density of @xmath85  @xmath7 , and should not have any effect on the basic mechanism we discussed .    in the calculations shown in sect .",
    "[ coating ] , we assumed a `` flat '' or homogeneous grain surface , represented by just one value of the absorption energy , @xmath14 , seen by the h@xmath0  molecules . but",
    "grain surfaces are thought to be rough , with an inhomogeneous structure of valleys , protrusions , cavities , and with and a certain degree of porosity .",
    "landing h@xmath0  molecules will be then subject to a variety of binding energies .",
    "results of the effects of surface roughness on the formation rate of h@xmath0  on grains @xcite show that irregularities affect the binding energies of the surface molecules , effectively increasing the binding energy `` seen '' by each molecule .",
    "we expect that h@xmath0  molecules will tend to fill the valleys of the surface and , probably , help to build , locally , more than one layer of h@xmath0  ice .",
    "we realise that there are several objections that could be raised against this approach .",
    "there were some experimental results that show that the surface coverage of h@xmath0  might be @xmath86% for a binding energy of 450  k @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the simulations of @xcite , h@xmath0  molecules pile up with co in it .",
    "the potential dislocation of ( almost completely ) coating h@xmath0  by an incident h@xmath0  or heavier molecule can act against this proposed mechanism for desorption of heavy molecules from grains in dark clouds .",
    "@xcite also indicated that the h@xmath0  molecular layer may not be rigid enough to prevent oncoming heavier molecules to bind themselves to the surface underneath the h@xmath0  layer .",
    "nonetheless , even if the h@xmath0  layer does not completely cover the grain surface and can not completely avoid that landing heavy molecular species bind with the surface below it , there is no doubt that h@xmath0  molecules must be located all over the grain surfaces , due to the ubiquity of h@xmath0  in molecular clouds .",
    "this should have some , maybe substantial , effect on the effective adsorption energy value of molecular species that in the right environment makes this mechanism relevant .",
    "particularly , after proving that some relatively small changes can affect a lot the depletion rate of heavy molecules .    at the same time , the present mechanism and the several previously proposed desorption mechanisms could very well work simultaneously .",
    "it is yet to be seen which process dominates in a certain environment , how effective the h@xmath0  coating can be or in which kind of environments it would be dominant .    the presence of a monolayer of h@xmath0-ice on the surfaces of grains in molecular clouds could be observationally tested .",
    "unfortunately , there is no clear evidence yet of the detection of solid h@xmath0  on interstellar grains .",
    "@xcite showed that solid h@xmath0  could be detected by an infrared absorption band at 2.417 @xmath87 m ( 4137 cm@xmath11 ) attributed to the @xmath89(1 ) pure vibrational transition of h@xmath0 .",
    "this band has never been detected and @xcite argue that it would probably trace the h@xmath0  trapped in water ices .",
    "@xcite proposed six pure @xmath90-hydrogen pair transition bands as candidates to explain unidentified emission features in iso - sws spectra of the ngc  7023 nebula .",
    "if any h@xmath0-ice absorption band was detected , it would be a combination of existing surface and mantle solid h@xmath0 .",
    "infrared spectroscopy studies of dust have found visual extinction thresholds of @xmath91 for h@xmath0o  ice @xcite , @xmath92 for co ice @xcite , and @xmath93 for co@xmath0 ice @xcite , which roughly correspond to very few monolayers of ice , probably between 2 and 5 @xcite .",
    "the detection of only one monolayer of h@xmath0  ice , in the absence of any solid h@xmath0  in the mantle , may not be yet feasible .    finally , it is interesting to consider if the h@xmath0-coating mechanism proposed here can have any influence on the determination of the visual extinction thresholds discussed above .",
    "as table  [ table_ed ] shows , the evaporation time of h@xmath0  on h@xmath0-ice is highly sensitive on temperature , @xmath94  s at 15  k. thus , at the expected temperatures of the grains at those visual extinctions thresholds ( between 12 and 20  k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , h@xmath0  molecules do not have time to build up on the grain surfaces and we do not expect them to play any relevant role .",
    "only when the grain temperatures go down to about 10  k will this mechanism delay the growth of ices    our simple modelling of the chemistry , changing the values of the adsorption energies , also proves how important is to obtain reliable estimates of evaporation energies , either laboratory measurements or theoretical calculations , for heavy molecules on h@xmath0  ice or , for that matter , in different kinds of substrate",
    ". a simplified experiment could be the study of h@xmath0  adsorption on various types of pure ice ( h@xmath0o , nh@xmath42 , so , so@xmath0 , h@xmath0co , ... ) to estimate the interaction potential between the h@xmath0  molecules and other heavier molecules .",
