    "in ref .  @xcite the jlab f@xmath61 collaboration extracted from the data the charged pion form factor @xmath7 using a regge model for high energy meson electroproduction  @xcite . along with this",
    "the recent jlab data on the rosenbluth separation of longitudinal and transverse cross sections for the reaction @xmath2 were presented for @xmath8 0.6 , 0.75 , 1 and 1.6 gev@xmath5/c@xmath5 and for the invariant mass @xmath3 1.95 gev .    the procedure for reggeization according to  @xcite is quite natural for the meson ( @xmath6 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ... ) @xmath1-pole diagrams , however , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have been forced to add a nucleon @xmath0-pole term to the regge amplitude to ensure gauge invariance . in general , the full sum of @xmath0-channel resonances taken with their proper form factors should be dual to the full sum of reggeon exchanges ( see , e.g. the recent review  @xcite ) , but actually the form factors for the transitions @xmath11 are only known with large uncertainties , and thus one can stay on a phenomenological level and use only some separate terms from both sums .    the aim of this letter is to show that an alternative ( microscopic ) description of quasi - elastic pion knockout from the proton can be obtained on the basis of a constituent quark model ( cqm ) . then with the fixed parameters of model ( which are a few in number ) one can predict the absolute value and the @xmath1-dependence of longitudinal @xmath12 and transverse @xmath13 cross sections for the reaction of pion quasi - elastic knockout from nucleon by electrons in a wide interval of intermediate energies .",
    "we start from two assumptions , which are natural in the framework of the cqm :    \\(a ) at energies @xmath14 2.1 - 2.3 gev and @xmath15 1 - 2 gev@xmath5/c@xmath5 characteristic of the jlab new measurements  @xcite there are no resonance peaks in the cross section , and thus one need not to account for the details of the intermediate nucleon excitations",
    ". only a combined effect of all the @xmath0- and @xmath16-channel contributions should be evaluated . in our opinion , a quark approach for such evaluation would be more convenient than the traditional baryon - resonance approach which characterized by many coupling constants and form factors .",
    "the @xmath1-pole contributions to the quasi - elastic pion knockout correspond to trivial quark diagrams shown in fig .",
    "our hypothesis is that in the kinematical region discussed the full sum of nucleon and excited - nucleon @xmath0- and @xmath16-pole terms can be represented by the quark diagrams in figs .",
    "1b , c . moreover , in the region of the pion @xmath1-pole , @xmath17 , the sum of all the @xmath0- and @xmath16-channel contributions should be a small correction to the t - pole contribution @xmath18 therefore , one can neglect the highest order corrections @xmath19 , e.g. generated by diagrams with one- or two - gluon exchange , in comparison to the dominant @xmath0- and @xmath16-pole terms in figs .",

    "quark form factors . in the cqm",
    "one can take the fourier transform of the pion wave function for the strong @xmath20 vertex form factor ( e.g. this can be shown  @xcite in terms of the @xmath21 model  @xcite ) .",
    "then , the quark amplitude for the @xmath0- or @xmath16-channel transition @xmath22 becomes proportional to the product of two form factors , the strong one @xmath23 and the electromagnetic form factor of the constituent quark @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is believed to be set by the chiral symmetry scale @xmath26 1 gev . ] . in the considered region of large @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath27 this product is equivalent to the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath28 .",
    "as this relationship has not been considered earlier on , here in appendix we obtain it with a simple calculation in terms of two diagrams pictured in fig .  2 . the quark diagram for pion form factor @xmath29 is shown in fig .",
    "2b with the same notations of momentum variables as for the discussed @xmath0-pole diagram represented in fig .",
    "2a ( with the scalar @xmath30 vertex @xmath31 of @xmath21 model ) .",
    "the solid line in both pictures shows the propagation of a large momentum @xmath32 transfered from photon to pion by a highly excited quark .",
    "it is intuitively clear that at fixed @xmath33 the contribution of this deeply off - shell quark and all the non - trivial @xmath33-dependence of the quark propagator takes effectively into account through the @xmath33-dependent vertex form factors @xmath34 and @xmath23 . ] into the both processes should be similar in value independently on details in diagrams in fig.2a and fig.2b .",
    "this assumption is formally confirmed by a simple calculation in terms of gaussian wave functions ( see appendix ) . as a result , in the considered kinematical region of quasi - elastic pion knockout both the @xmath1- and @xmath35-contributions to the amplitude become proportional to a common form factor @xmath7 which can be factorized from the sum of @xmath1- and @xmath35-pole diagram contributions .",
    "note that in a phenomenological approach  @xcite such common form factor was introduced _ by hand _ to preserve gauge invariance of the calculated amplitude .",
    "in this work we obtain an evaluation of a common effect of @xmath0- and @xmath16-pole contributions to the cross section .",
    "the overall contribution of such terms is @xmath4- and @xmath27-dependent and vanishes with increasing @xmath27 and @xmath4 in direct proportion to the factor @xmath36 ( the final expression looks like a generalization of the kroll - ruderman contact term by introduction of a @xmath4- and @xmath27-dependent form factor into it ) .",
    "our evaluation shows that for jlab data  @xcite at lower @xmath4 ( 0.6 and @xmath37 gev@xmath5/c@xmath5 ) this contribution is important and can not be neglected , comparable with the cutoff parameter @xmath38 0.7 gev / c in @xmath39 vertices , one can not exclude the direct contribution of intermediate baryon resonances to the cross section .",
    "formally such small @xmath4 are out of the region of the quasi - elastic kinematics . ] , while at higher values of @xmath4 and @xmath27 it becomes considerably smaller and practically invisible in the cross section at @xmath14 3 gev . here",
    "we predict the @xmath1-dependence of the longitudinal and transverse cross section for a new jlab measurement at @xmath32.1 - 2.3  gev .",
    "the possibility of describing the high - energy pion electroproduction in terms of the pion @xmath1-channel mechanism has been discussed in the literature over many years  @xcite .",
    "an important argument  @xcite is that the contribution of the @xmath0-channel diagrams in fig.1b is suppressed by a factor @xmath40 in comparison to the contribution of the @xmath1-channel diagrams . in refs",
    "@xcite , the pion - exchange ( @xmath1-channel diagram ) was calculated using the light - front dynamics . in principle , this made it possible to extract the strong @xmath41 form factor @xmath42 from comparison of a calculated longitudinal cross section @xmath12 with the data at high momentum transfer @xmath15 2 -3 gev@xmath5/c@xmath5 .",
    "but in practice , the accessible data on high - quality rosenbluth separation are limited by too small @xmath4 and @xmath27 , where the @xmath35-contributions can not be neglected .",
    "in contrast to those studies , in ref .  @xcite the process @xmath2 was considered in the laboratory frame . in this case one",
    "is able to single out , in a natural way , the kinematical region where the recoil momentum of the final nucleon @xmath43 with @xmath44 is small and where only the momentum @xmath45 of the knocked out meson is large . in that ( quasi - elastic ) region at @xmath46",
    "gev@xmath5 4-momentum @xmath47 transfered to the nucleon can be related to the 3-momentum @xmath48 , @xmath49 . therefore ,",
    "both the initial @xmath50 and the final - state @xmath51 nucleons are nonrelativistic ones . in the cqm",

    "the @xmath1-pole amplitude for the @xmath63 process on the @xmath64-th quark ( fig.1a ) is @xmath65 where @xmath7 is the pion electromagnetic form factor and @xmath66 is the @xmath20 vertex operator for the @xmath64-th quark , which is related to the pion - nucleon form factor @xmath67 as @xmath68 in the following , for convenience , we proceed with the normalized pion - nucleon form factor @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "we use a simple form of the operator @xmath66 neglecting the momentum dependence since the exchanged pion and the constituent quarks are approximately on their mass shells .",
    "the quark - level amplitude @xmath71 gives rise to the @xmath1-pole matrix element for @xmath72 electroproduction from the nucleon @xmath73 which is proportional to the strong form factor @xmath74 defined above . at @xmath75 fm , which is",
    "a typical scale in the cqm ( at small @xmath76 gev@xmath5 this gaussian is very close to the monopole form factor with @xmath77 gev ) , the matrix element ( [ tpme ] ) gives a reasonable description of the @xmath1-dependence of the differential cross sections in the jlab experiment ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , since the @xmath0- and @xmath16- channel quark contributions ( fig .",
    "1b , c ) , which are required for gauge invariance , have not been taken into account , the results of such simple quark evaluation ( dashed lines in the upper panels of fig .",

    "the kinematics is the following .",
    "two particles , pion and ingoing ( outgoing ) quark , are on mass shell : @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , where @xmath84 is the mass of the constituent quark .",
