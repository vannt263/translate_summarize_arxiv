    "[ ref-1.1 - 0 ] the git quotient @xmath24 is in a natural way a poisson variety .",
    "this result is not unexpected since if @xmath3 is a `` star '' then it is shown in @xcite that the points in @xmath25 correspond to local systems on @xmath26 whose monodromy lies in the closure of specific conjugacy classes .",

    "a well - known philosophy in non - commutative algebraic geometry ( probably first formulated by maxim kontsevich ) is that for a property of the non - commutative ring @xmath29 to have geometric meaning it should induce standard geometric properties on all @xmath33 .",

    "it is customary to describe a poisson bracket on a smooth variety @xmath60 in terms of a bivector field , i.e. in terms of a section @xmath61 of @xmath62 satisfying @xmath63 where @xmath40 is the so - called _ schouten - nijenhuis bracket _ on @xmath64 .",
    "our next aim is to give non - commutative version of this .    in the rest of this introduction",
    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath29 is _ smooth _ by which we mean that @xmath29 is finitely generated and @xmath65 is a projective @xmath29-bimodule .",
    "it is easy to see that this implies that all spaces @xmath66 are smooth over @xmath0 .",
    "we first have to find the correct non - commutative analogue of a vector field .",
    "there are in fact _ two _ good answers to this . if we insist that a vector field on @xmath29 induces vector fields on all @xmath33 then a vector field on @xmath29 should simply be a derivation @xmath67 .",
    "the induced derivation @xmath68 on @xmath35 is then given by @xmath69 a second point of view is that a vector field @xmath70 on @xmath29 should induce _ matrix valued vector fields _",
    "@xmath71 on all @xmath33 .",
    "since now @xmath72 depends on four indices @xmath73 should be an element of @xmath43 .    in this paper",
    "we accept the second point of view , i.e.   vector fields on @xmath29 will be elements of @xmath74 where as usual we put the outer bimodule structure on @xmath43 .",

    "another main result of this paper is ( see  [ ref-3.2 - 44 ] )    the graded algebra @xmath81 has the structure of a _ double gerstenhaber algebra _",
    "i.e.  a ( super ) double poisson algebra with a double poisson bracket @xmath47 of degree @xmath10 .",
    "we call @xmath47 the _ schouten - nijenhuis bracket _ on @xmath81 .",

    "for example we say that @xmath94 is a _ moment map _ for a double poisson bracket @xmath61 if the following identity holds in @xmath76 : @xmath95 the reason is of course that if @xmath94 then the corresponding matrix valued function @xmath96 defines a moment map @xmath97 for the action of @xmath32 on @xmath33 ( where we identify , as is customary , @xmath98 with its dual through the trace map ) .",
    "we can also define the corresponding multiplicative notions ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the second part of this theorem is an application of ( quasi ) hamiltonian reduction @xcite .",
    "now we discuss quivers .",
    "thus we return to the setting in the beginning of this introduction . in order for things to work nicely we must set things up in a relative setting .",

    "the induced lie algebra structure on @xmath144 $ ] is the so - called _ necklace lie algebra _ @xcite .",
    "however it is noteworthy that this lie algebra structure is induced from a loday algebra structure on @xmath28 . in ",

    "we outline the connection between the two papers .",
    "in particular we prove that an algebra with a bi - symplectic form is a double poisson algebra .",
    "this allows us to strengthen some results of @xcite .",

    "crawley - boevey introduces non - commutative poisson structures and shows that they induce classical poisson structures on moduli spaces of representations . in the commutative case",
    "a poisson structure is the same as a classical poisson structure .",
    "we show below that a double poisson bracket or a double quasi - poisson bracket induces a poisson structure ( lemmas [ ref-2.6.2 - 39 ] and [ ref-5.1.3 - 73 ] ) . by considering commutative algebras",
    "one easily sees that the converse is false .",
    "the concept of a double poisson structure is more adapted to algebras which are smooth in a non - commutative sense @xcite .",
    "for example a semi - simple algebra has no poisson structures ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.2 ) but it has many double poisson structures @xcite .      the reader will find that this paper is rather peculiarly organized .",
    "we have seen that our motivating example is not a double poisson algebra but only a double quasi - poisson algebra .",
    "but it seemed difficult to treat double quasi - poisson algebras without first introducing the algebra of poly - vector fields and its schouten bracket .",
    "this schouten bracket is a graded version of a double poisson bracket .",
    "but again it seemed unreasonable to start this paper with graded double poisson brackets since the many signs would have obscured the simplicity of the theory .",
    "jean - louis loday pointed out to me that the sign problems can be mitigated by writing the definitions in terms of functions instead of elements .",
    "however since the schouten bracket has degree @xmath10 some signs would still remain .",
    "so we have chosen to treat double poisson brackets first , and then to accept the ( routine ) generalizations of our statements to super poisson brackets without further proof or discussion .",
    "this paper came out of discussions with crawley - boevey and alexei bondal during the year on non - commutative algebraic geometry at the mittag - leffler institute .",
    "it was crawley - boevey who suggested that the element @xmath103 occurring in the definition of a multiplicative preprojective algebra could perhaps be interpreted as a multiplicative moment map .",
    "i am very grateful for this .",
    "the principle that one can meaningfully study non - commutative notions through their effect on representation spaces i learned from lieven le bruyn @xcite .",
    "in addition i wish to thank victor ginzburg , jean - louis loday and geert van de weyer for interesting discussions and comments .",
    "jean - louis loday objected to my use of the term loday algebra ( taken from @xcite ) and wished me to use the original terminology of leibniz algebras instead .",
    "after some consideration i decided that it is never bad to name a concept after its inventor so i left things as they were .",
    "finally i am very grateful to the anonymous referee for his thorough reading of the manuscript and for pointing out numerous misprints and inaccuracies .",
