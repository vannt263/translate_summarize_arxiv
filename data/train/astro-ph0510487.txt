    "at the time of the writing of this review , the tenth anniversary of the discovery of the first extrasolar planet around a solar  type star is being celebrated .",
    "when this detection was announced , it came as a shock , not because an extrasolar planet was at last found around a star like our sun  nobody really had doubts that such a detection would occur one day or another  but because of the very short period of this planet , 51  pegasi .",
    "it orbits its parent star in only 4  days !",
    "it is 100 times closer to the star than jupiter is from the sun .",
    "the temperatures at these distances from the star are so high that the material needed to assemble the core of such planets can not be found in a solid phase there .",
    "the implication is that the planet formed further out and moved in .",
    "it did not take long for the theorists to propose an explanation : tidal interactions between the planet and the disk in which it formed led to orbital migration .",
    "the theory of such processes had already been developed , about 15  years before the discovery of 51  pegasi , and orbital migration of planets had been predicted .",
    "the real surprise , then , was that nobody ever predicted that planets might be found on very short period orbits .",
    "as of today , about 150 planets have been detected .",
    "their orbital chatacteristics suggest that planet / disk tidal interactions is very important in determining the characteristics of planetary systems .",
    "this review is divided in four sections .",
    "the first section is devoted to the observations of extrasolar planets .",
    "we first present the different methods used to detect planets , and review the statistical properties of the systems observed so far . in the second section , we review the theories of planet formation .",
    "we describe the different stages that lead to the build  up of a terrestrial planet or a planetary core ( grain sedimentation , obtention of planetesimals , runaway accumulation ) , and the process by which an enveloppe of gas may be captured to produce a giant planet .",
    "we also discuss giant planet formation by gravitational instabilities .",
    "the third section is devoted to disk / planet interactions and the different types of orbital migration .",
    "finally , in the fourth section , we review some results about multiplanet systems and their interactions .",
    "the first object outside our solar system with a mass in the range of planetary masses was detected in 1992 around the millisecond pulsar psr1257 + 12a ( wolszczan & frail 1992 ) .",
    "three planets of 0.02 , 4.3 and 3.9 earth masses orbiting at 0.19 , 0.36 and 0.46 astronomical units ( au ) from the pulsar , respectively , were actually found .",
    "another object of about 100 earth masses with a separation of 40  au was reported more recently ( joshi & rasio 1997 , wolszczan 1996 ) . in 1993 , backer announced the detection of a 2.5 jupiter mass ( m@xmath0 ) planet orbiting the millisecond pulsar 162026 at a distance of 23  au .",
    "this pulsar is in a binary system with a white dwarf companion ( thorsett 1999 ) and a separation of about 40  au .",
    "it is not clear whether these planets formed before the explosion of the parent supernova or after , either from the material which was ejected during the explosion or , in the case of the pulsar 162026 , in the disk of material transferred from the white dwarf .",
    "the first extrasolar planet around a sun  like star ( 51  pegasi  b ) was reported in 1995 by mayor & queloz .",
    "it was detected from haute  provence observatory , and immediately confirmed by marcy & butler ( 1995 ) , who observed it from lick observatory ( see the review by marcy  & butler  1998 for more details about the detection of the first eight extrasolar planets ) . since then , there has been an uninterrupted flow of detections . as of today",
    "( 16 march 2005 ) , 152 planets in 134 planetary systems ( including 14 multiple planet systems ) have been reported around solar type stars .",
    "the lightest object has a mass of 0.042  m@xmath0 .",
    "we will focus here on the objects with masses smaller than 13  m@xmath0 , as heavier objects are usually considered to be brown dwarfs .",
    "this review is concerned with extrasolar planets around solar type stars , so we will not discuss further planets around pulsars .",
    "so far , almost all the planets have been detected by this technique , which consists in measuring the doppler shift due to the motion of the star around the center of mass of the system .",
    "the velocity of the star projected along the line of sight ( or _ radial velocity _ ) is , to within a constant , @xmath1 , where the function @xmath2 varies periodically with time @xmath3 around the orbit and has zero mean and    @xmath4    here @xmath5 is the constant of gravitation , @xmath6 is the orbital period , @xmath7 is the mass of the star , @xmath8 is the planet mass , @xmath9 is the angle of the line of sight with respect to the perpendicular to the orbital plane and @xmath10 is the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "the observation of @xmath11 as a function of time gives @xmath6 directly .",
    "if the orbit is circular , @xmath2 is a sinusoid with unit amplitude . for non circular orbits the amplitude can reach @xmath12 and the departure from a sinusoid allows determination of the eccentricity @xmath10 .",
    "given @xmath6 and @xmath10 , one can deduce @xmath13 from the measurement of @xmath14 ( @xmath7 being known ) . note that since @xmath15 , the semi ",
    "major axis @xmath16 can be calculated from @xmath6 .    since @xmath9 is unknown , only the lower limit @xmath13 for the planet mass , or _",
    "projected mass _ , can be obtained .",
    "this was of course an important matter of debate when the very first planet was detected .",
    "however , for a population of about 150 objects , the ratio of the real mass to the projected mass is on average on the order of unity .",
    "the expression for @xmath14 shows that only relatively massive planets with short periods can be detected with the radial velocity method . using @xmath17 ,",
    "we can rewrite @xmath14 and @xmath6 in the form :    @xmath18    @xmath19    the detection limit of the instruments that are currently being used is about 1  m  s@xmath20 . in principle",
    ", jupiter mass planets could be detected rather far from their parent star .",
    "however , the detection is confirmed only if the planet if monitored for at least one orbital period .",
    "given that surveys began about 10  years ago , only planets with semi  major axes less than about 45  au can be observed .",
    "note that a jupiter mass planet with @xmath21  au around a solar mass star induces a velocity @xmath22  m  s@xmath20 .    for an earth mass planet with @xmath23  au around a solar mass star , @xmath24  m  s@xmath20 .",
    "it is not clear whether such a precision could be reached .",
    "such a signal would have to be extracted from the `` noise '' at the stellar surface , i.e. random doppler shifts due to atmospheric oscillations , stellar spots , or long period effects caused by magnetic cycles .",
    "note that the distance to the star is not a limiting factor as long as enough photons can be collected .",
    "several long  term radial velocity surveys for planets are ongoing in different countries ( for a list see perryman et al .",
    "they all use ground  based telescopes . new detections are regularly announced .",
    "so far all the planets found with this technique are within about 100  parsecs ( pc ) from the earth .      the first transit of an extrasolar planet ( hd  209458  b ) was detected in september 1999 ( charbonneau 2000 ) .",
    "the planet , which is on an orbit with @xmath25  au , had already been observed by the radial velocity method .",
    "the detection of the transit , in addition to proving beyond doubt that the doppler shift was indeed caused by a planet , enabled the planet mass ( 0.63 m@xmath0 ) to be determined , as @xmath26 has to be close to  1 for a transit to be seen .",
    "it also enabled the planet radius ( 1.3 jupiter radius ) to be measured , as the relative variation of the stellar flux during the transit is :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the planet radius and @xmath29 is the stellar radius .",
    "for jupiter orbiting the sun , @xmath30% , whereas for the earth it is 0.01% . from the ground",
    ", the accuracy is about 0.1% and is limited by the variable extinction of the atmosphere . from space ,",
    "the accuracy reaches @xmath31  % so that terrestrial planets could be detected without any problem .",
    "however , the probability of detecting a transit , @xmath32 , is rather small . for @xmath33  r@xmath34 ,",
    "this probability is about 10% for @xmath35  au , i.e. for the planets on the tightest orbits known to date .",
    "therefore , a large number of stars have to be observed for a significant number of transits to be detected .",
    "note that the mean mass density of hd  209458  b can be calculated from its mass and radius .",
    "it is found to be about 400  kg  m@xmath36 , significantly smaller than the mean density of saturn ( 700  kg  m@xmath36 ) , the least dense of the planets of our solar system .",
    "this confirms that this planet is made mainly of gas .",
    "the atmosphere of the planet was further detected by hst , which observed additional sodium absorption due to the light passing through the planet atmosphere as it transited across the star ( charbonneau 2002 ) .",
    "more recently , atomic hydrogen , oxygen and carbon have also been detected in the extended envelope around the planet ( vidal - madjar 2003 , 2004 ) , suggesting the atmosphere is evaporating .",
    "the first planet found by the transit method , tres1 , was detected by the stare ( stellar astrophysics & research on exoplanets ) program ( alonso 2004 ) , and confirmed 8  days later by an amateur astronomer in belgium . since then",
    ", 5 more planets have been found by this method by ogle ( optical gravitational lensing experiment ) .",
    "all these planets have lately been confirmed by radial velocity measurements .",
    "their separation from the central star ranges from 0.0225 to 0.047  au .",
    "the planets found by ogle are about 1,500  pc away , much further away than the planets found by the radial velocity method .",
    "several ground  based surveys for planet transits are ongoing .",
    "a few space missions dedicated at least in part to the planet search are also being developed .",
    "the first experiment , which will be launched in 2006 , is corot ( for convection rotation and planetary transits ) , a mini - satellite developed by the french national space agency ( cnes ) .",
    "its precision is 0.03% , so that it will detect only planets with a radius larger than twice the earth radius .",
    "it will monitor about 60,000 stars during 2.5 years .",
    "the next experiment is kepler , which will be launched in 2007 by nasa .",
    "its precision is 10@xmath36  % and it will monitor 10@xmath37 stars during 4  years .",
    "it is expected to find at least 50  terrestrial planets .",
    "the radial velocity method described above uses the motion of the star _ along _ the line of sight .",
    "it is also possible to measure the motion of the star _",
    "perpendicular _ to the line of sight and to derive the characteristics of the planet and its orbit from it .",
    "if the planet is on a circular orbit , the angular motion of the star is :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the distance to the star , measured in parsecs . since",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath7 are known and @xmath16 is given by the periodicity of the star motion , @xmath8 can be derived from the measure of @xmath40 .",
    "the motion of the sun caused by jupiter and seen from a distance of 10  pc is 500  @xmath41as , whereas that due to the earth , and seen from the same distance , is 0.3  @xmath41as .",
    "> from the ground , the interferometers provide the best astrometric accuracy .",
    "it is about 1  mas for the vlti and keck in the near  ir , and should reach 10  @xmath41as in the near future over narrow fields of view .",
    "surveys for planets with these interferometers will begin in the very near future .    for space observations",
    ", the accuracy will be on the order of 1  @xmath41as .",
    "therefore , since the stars that are being observed are at least at a distance of a few parsecs , it will not be possible to detect terrestrial planets in habitable zones with this method , which is better suited for the observation of giant planets .",
    "note that astrometric measurements are easier for longer period systems .",
    "this method and the radial velocity method are thus complementary .    to date",
    ", only one space mission , hipparcos ( which was launched by esa in 1989 and operated until 1993 ) , was dedicated to astrometric measurements .",
    "although it was not meant to detect planets , it did observe stars around which planets were later observed .",
    "its measurements were therefore used to constrain the mass of some of the planets discovered by the radial velocity method .",
    "two space experiments are currently being developed .",
    "sim ( space interferometry mission ) is scheduled for launch by nasa in 2010 .",
    "its accuracy will be 1  @xmath41as .",
    "it will not observe a very large number of stars but will focus in particular on the multiple systems already detected from the ground to get precise measurement of the orbital characteristics .",
    "gaia , which is scheduled for launch by esa in 2011 , will have an accuracy of 210  @xmath41as and will observe @xmath42 stars within a distance of about 200  pc from the sun during 5  years .",
    "simulations indicate that gaia could detect between 10,000 and 50,000 giant planets .",
    "this technique relies on a background star to provide a source of light",
    ". then , foreground stars act as gravitational lenses when they pass in front of the background star and cause the source star to suddenly brighten by as much as 1000 times .",
    "this typically lasts for a few weeks or months .",
    "while this is the normal pattern of a microlensing event , things are substantially different when the lensing ( foreground ) star has a smaller companion .",
    "if a planet is positioned close enough to the lensing star , it will indeed perturb the light curve by adding two successive spikes of brightness , superimposed upon the regular pattern of the microlensing event ( mao & paczynski 1991 , gould & loeb 1992 , bennett & rhie 1996 ) .",
    "microlensing is most sensitive to planets at a separation @xmath435  au from the lens star .",
    "in addition , effects on light curves are large even for planets of less than an earth mass .",
    "this technique is therefore well suited for finding terrestrial planets in habitable zones .",
    "an inconvenient aspect of the microlensing technique is that the events do not repeat .",
    "several collaborations , from around the world , are presently searching for planets with the microlensing technique .",
    "two of them ( ogle and moa ) are survey programs which monitor large number of stars .",
    "the two other projects ( planet and microfun ) pick up on the alerts that are issued by the survey collaborations when a microlensing event is detected and do a follow  up monitoring of the event .",
    "one planet ( ogle235moa53 ) has been found in 2004 simultaneously by the moa and ogle collaborations ( bond 2004 ) .",
    "its mass and semi  major axis are about 2  m@xmath0 and 3  au , respectively .",
    "it is located at a distance of 5.2  kpc from earth , which is much too far away for the radial velocity method to be used .",
    "so far , the microlensing programs have mainly put limits on the percentage of stars harboring planets within a given range of separations .",
    "analysis of 5  years of planet photometry indicates that less than 33% of the m  dwarfs in the galactic bulge can have jupiter ",
    "mass companions within a distance between 1.5 and 4  au .",
    "the upper limit is raised to 45% if the range of separations considered is 17  au ( gaudi 2002 ) .",
    "a space  based gravitational microlensing program ( gest , for galactic exoplanet survey telescope ) is currently being studied by nasa .",
    "gest , which would be able to detect planets with masses as low as that of mars , would survey more than 100 million stars .",
    "it would be expected to find about 100 earth mass planets .",
    "the direct detections of the transiting planets hd  209458  b ( deming et al .",
    "2005 ) and tres1 ( charbonneau 2005 ) were reported simultaneously in march 2005 .",
    "these were the very first observations of photons emitted by extrasolar planets .",
    "the detections were made by the spitzer space telescope by observing the decrement in infrared flux during the secondary eclipses , when the planets passed behind their parent star .",
    "these observations enable the brightness temperature of the planets at a given wavelength to be calculated and , assuming some model for the atmosphere , a blackbody temperature to be estimated .    in general , direct imaging of extrasolar planets will enable long period objects to be detected , and therefore will complement radial velocity surveys .",
    "very low mass non transiting objects can currently be detected only if they are isolated ( e.g. , free floating planets ) .",
    "bound planets are much more difficult to observe because of the very high star to planet flux ratio .",
    "the contrast is smaller in the ir , which is therefore the most favourable range of wavelengths for planet imaging .",
    "the light coming from the star can in addition be blocked by using a coronograph or nulling techniques on interferometers . to limit the halo of the star so that it is not brighter than the planet , both turbulence and defects of the instrument have to be corrected with unprecedented precision ,",
    "so a high  performance adaptive optics system is needed .",
    "the latest developments in adaptive optics ( the first light from naos , a system installed by eso on the vlt , was received in 2001 ) suggest that a system for direct detection of extrasolar planets may be available on 810 meter ground  based telescopes within 5 years .",
    "several ground  based projects are currently being developed or under study .",
    "most of them rely on interferometers to image planets .",
    "there are also several space based projects , among which are darwin ( studied by esa ) and terrestrial planet finder ( studied by nasa )",
    ". these space interferometers would be able to detect earth  like planets in habitable zones and to perform spectroscopic observations of their atmosphere . given the ambitious nature of both projects , nasa and esa may collaborate on the final mission .",
    "so far , about 5% of the stars monitored in radial velocity surveys have been found to harbor at least one planet .",
    "this is a lower limit of course , as low ",
    "mass and/or long  period objects can not be detected with the current techniques .",
    "the histograms of the projected mass @xmath13 and semi  major axis @xmath16 of the known extrasolar planets are shown in figure  [ fig_stath ] .",
    "the lightest object has a mass of 0.042  m@xmath0 or 13.3  earth masses , which is very close to the mass of uranus .",
    "although the radial velocity surveys are biased towards massive planets , 37% of the planets detected so far have a mass smaller than 1  m@xmath0 and only 13% have a mass larger than 5  m@xmath0 .",
    "_ within a few  au from the central star , there is a deficit of massive planets . _",
    "+    the distribution of @xmath16 shows that there is a significant number of planets ( 12% ) with @xmath16 between 0.035 and 0.05  au , i.e. an orbital period between 2.5 and 4  days ( the so  called `` hot jupiters '' ) .",
    "only 4  objects have a smaller period , which suggests that _ there is a pile  up at a rather well  defined separation ( @xmath44  au ) or period ( @xmath45  days ) . _",
    "only very few objects with a mass larger than that of uranus seem to be able to `` leak '' through what looks like a barrier . since observations are biased towards short  period planets , as noted by , e.g. , marcy et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , _ there is clear rise of the distribution with separation . _ beyond @xmath46",
    "the data appears to be subject to @xmath47 noise with dependence on binning , an approximate smooth representation for the number of planets @xmath48 with semi ",
    "major axis less than @xmath16 in @xmath49 is @xmath50 according to this , the number expected within an interval of @xmath51 in @xmath52 is @xmath53 or 19 at @xmath54 or 0 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig_stat1 ] shows the projected mass @xmath13 _ vs. _ semi  major axis @xmath16 .",
    "planets in multiple systems are indicated by open symbols .",
    "_ there is a deficit of sub ",
    "jupiter mass planets at separations larger than @xmath55  au .",
    "_ more precisely , there is no planet with @xmath56  m@xmath0 at @xmath57  au .",
    "since about 10% of the planets have a mass lower than 0.7  m@xmath0 , the absence of such planets at separations larger than 0.5  au , where 57% of the planets are , is statistically significant .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines in figure  [ fig_stat1 ] indicate the detection limit for planets on circular orbits and an accuracy of 3  and 10  m  s@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "it is not clear that the deficit of low  mass planets at larger @xmath16 is the result of observational biases ( see also udry et al .",
    "_ there is also a deficit of high mass planets at separations smaller than @xmath58  au . _",
    "more precisely , there is no planet with @xmath59  m@xmath0 at @xmath60  au .",
    "as observations favor massive planets with short  periods , this deficit is not due to an observational bias .",
    "it has further been pointed out that planets more massive than 2  m@xmath0 at @xmath61  au are actually members of binary star systems ( zucker & mazeh  2002 ) .",
    "projected mass @xmath13 ( in m@xmath62 ) _ vs. _ semi  major axis @xmath16 ( in au ) on logarithmic scales for the known extrasolar planets .",

    "figure  [ fig_state ] shows the eccentricity @xmath10 _ vs. _ semi  major axis @xmath16 and projected mass @xmath13 .",
    "planets with @xmath64  au have almost circular orbits , which is consistent with tidal circularization . at larger separations , _ the eccentricity varies from 0 up to 0.93 .",
    "_ this is in sharp contrast with the planets of our solar system , which are on nearly circular orbits .",
    "the upper limit of 0.93 may be special , as it may be due to the secular perturbation of the planet hd  80606  b by a stellar companion on an inclined orbit ( wu & murray 2003 ) .",
    "nonetheless , eccentricities in the range 00.8 are common .",
    "note that higher eccentricities seem to be obtained for more distant planets .",
    "the eccentricity distribution of planets in systems of multiple planets is similar to that of planets in single systems .",
    "+    figure  [ fig_state ] shows that higher eccentricities are obtained for more massive planets .",
    "this is consistent with the trend noted above of higher eccentricities at larger separations together with the fact that more massive planets are at larger separations .",
    "but note that the observed distributions could be produced either by physical processes tending to produce higher eccentricities for higher masses or higher eccentricities at larger orbital separations or a combination of the two .",
    "a suggested process of the former type is eccentricity generation through disk planet interaction ( artymowicz 1992 ) and one of the latter type is orbital circularization close to the central star . here again , the eccentricity distribution of planets in systems of multiple planets is similar to that of planets in single systems .",
    "halbwachs ( 2005 ) suggest that the differences between the eccentricity distributions of planets and stellar binaries is an indication that these two classes of objects have different formation mechanisms .",
    "figure  [ fig_hist3 ] shows the metallicity distribution of the stars around which planets have been found .",
    "the metallicity of most of the field dwarfs with no known companion lies in the range -0.30.2 ( santos 2001 ) .",
    "the planet host stars are therefore metal rich , and the planetary frequency is clearly increasing with metallicity . this metallicity excess appears to have a `` primordial '' origin ( pinsonneault 2001 ; santos 2001 ; santos 2002 ; sadakane 2002 ) , rather than being due to the infall of planetary material onto the star which might result in observed heavy element polution for stars in the mass range 11.3  m@xmath65 ( e.g. sandquist et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ) .",
    "the favored explanation for the high metallicity of planet host stars is therefore that planets form more easily in a metal rich environment .",
    "note that no short  period planets were found in the metal poor globular cluster 47  tucanae in which about 34,000 stars were monitored by hst .",
    "simulations had shown that about 17 hot jupiters should have been detected by photometric transit signals if the frequency of these objects were the same in the solar neighborhood and in 47  tucanae ( gilliland 2000 ) .",

    "figure  [ fig_statm ] shows the stellar metallicity _ vs. _",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath13 and @xmath10 .",
    "sozzetti ( 2004 ) has found that there is a weak correlation ( at the 2 to 3@xmath66 level ) between the stellar metallicity and the orbital period of the system .",
    "this correlation becomes stronger when only single stars with one detected planet are considered .",
    "+      as noted above , the most massive short  period planets are all members of stellar binaries ( zucker and mazeh 2002 ) .",
    "it also appears that planets orbiting a component of a multiple star system tend to have a very low eccentricity when their period is shorter than about 40  days , i.e. when @xmath16 is smaller than about 0.2  au ( eggenberger 2004 ) .",
    "recently , a population of about 30 very young ( a few myr ) free  floating objects with planetary masses ( from a few to 13  m@xmath62 ) has been found in the sigma orionis open cluster ( zapatero osorio 2000 ) and in the trapezium ( lucas and roche 2000 ) .",
    "the lightest of these objects is s  ori  70 ( zapatero osorio 2002 ) .",
    "its mass is derived from evolutionary models and is estimated to be 3  m@xmath62 .",
    "however , burgasser ( 2004 ) claim that this object may actually not be a member of the @xmath66 orionis cluster , in which case its mass may be much higher .",
    "bjar ( 2001 ) have pointed out that if the distribution of stellar and substellar masses in @xmath66 orionis is representative of the galactic disk , older and much lower luminosity free ",
    "floating objects with masses down to a few m@xmath0 should be abundant in the solar vicinity , with a density similar to m  type stars .",
    "the discovery of these free  floating objects has brought some confusion in the definition of planets , as they are not orbiting a star and they probably have not formed through the standard core  accretion scenario ( see below ) .",
    "terrestrial planets are believed to be formed via solid body accretion of km ",
    "sized objects , which themselves are produced as a result of the sedimentation and collisional growth of dust grains in the protoplanetary disk ( see lissauer 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "this theory comes from the idea already proposed in the 19th century that the earth and the other terrestrial planets were formed from meteoritic material . at the beginning of the 20th century",
    ", this idea was supported by the geologist t.  c.  chamberlin who called `` planetesimals '' the solid objects that had accumulated to form the planets .",
    "but it is only in the 1960s that the theory was developed in a quantitative way by v.  safronov ( 1969 ) , who calculated in details the different stages of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "this pioneering work , originally written in russian , was published in english in 1972 under the title `` evolution of the protoplanetary cloud '' . since then",
    ", the theory has been further developed , in particular by g.  w.  wetherill and collaborators who have used intensive numerical simulations to study planetesimal accumulation .",
    "as far as giant planets are concerned , two theories have been proposed .",
    "according to the first theory , giant planets are formed through collapse and fragmentation of protostellar disks .",
    "this scenario is related to that proposed by laplace in 1796 . in its modern version ,",

    "it is still being studied today .",
    "the second theory , proposed by cameron in 1973 , is called the `` core accretion model '' .",
    "a solid core is first assembled in the same way as terrestrial planets .",
    "once the core becomes massive enough to gravitationally bind the gas in which it is embedded ( typically at around a tenth of an earth mass ( see section  [ sec : formgiant ] below ) , a gaseous envelope begins to form around the core .      in the formation of terrestrial planets or planetary cores ,",
    "several stages can be considered .",
    "firstable , micron sized dust grains that are present when the disk forms sediment towards the disk midplane .",
    "these grains are subject to both the drag force exerted by the gas and the gravitational force from the central star .",
    "accumulation of grains during this first stage leads to cm / m sized particles .",
    "it is still not clear how these objects further grow to become 0.11  km sized planetesimals .",
    "it is likely that growth occurs through collisions and accumulation .",
    "the planetesimals are massive enough that mutual gravitational interactions have to be taken into account in computing their evolution .",
    "further collisions and accumulation lead to terrestrial planets or the core of giant planets .",
    "these different processes are described in details below .",
    "when the disk forms out of the collapse of a molecular cloud , it contains dust grains which size is that of the interstellar grains , i.e. 0.11  @xmath41 m . under the action of the gravitational force exerted by the central star and the drag force exerted by the gas , when there is no turbulence present , these grains tend to undergo damped oscillations around the disk midplane , toward which they eventually sediment .",
    "simultaneously , they drift toward the disc center .",
    "this is because the coupling with the gas forces them to rotate at a slightly sub  keplerian velocity .",
    "since they are not supported by pressure forces , they consequently can not stay on a fixed orbit .    for typical disk parameters ,",
    "the gas mean free path around the disc midplane is @xmath67  1  m. this is very large compared to the size of the grains we are interested in here . in this regime ,",

    "this formula is valid provided @xmath74 , which is the case here as can be checked _ a posteriori_. we define the time : @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the mass of a dust grain .",
    "this is the timescale it takes for the velocity of a grain subject only to the drag force to decrease by a factor @xmath10 . for @xmath77  @xmath41 m , @xmath78  g  cm@xmath36 , @xmath80  cm  s@xmath20 ( which corresponds to a temperature of about 700  k ) , which are typical conditions at about 1  au from the central star , and assuming the mass density of the grains to be 3  g  cm@xmath36 ( which is comparable to the mass density of the earth s crust and that of the asteroids ) , we get @xmath81  s.    for the gas , we write @xmath82 in cylindrical coordinates and , for the dust , @xmath83 . we assume the motion of the grains to be almost keplerian with a small drift velocity , i.e. @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the keplerian velocity . in this situation in a steady state , the dust to a first approximation comoves with the gas so that @xmath87 this means that accelerations due to radial pressure gradients acting on the gas have to be balanced by the accelerations due to drag acting on the dust which occur because of the radial drift velocity which will be given by : @xmath88 as expected , if the pressure increases inwards , @xmath89 .",

    "if the grains were not subject to the gas drag force , they would oscillate around the disk midplane with the frequency @xmath97 .",
    "since @xmath101 , the oscillations are suppressed and the grains sediment towards the disk midplane . as for a highly damped harmonic oscillator , the characteristic timescale for sedimentation is @xmath102 here @xmath103 is the mass density of the grains . for the values of the parameters used above , @xmath104  years at 1  au",
    "this is small compared to the planet formation timescale , as will be seen below .",
    "we have supposed that @xmath76 and @xmath69 are constant , so that @xmath105 given above is actually a maximum .",
    "indeed , if the grains grow through collisions as they fall toward the midplane , the drag force due to the gas decreases and the sedimentation is accelerated .",
    "note that during @xmath105 , the grains drift radially over a distance @xmath106 , which is on the order of @xmath99  au at 1  au .",
    "this is very small compared to the disk semithickness ( @xmath67  0.1  au ) , which justifies the neglect of @xmath98 in the discussion of the vertical motion .",
    "grains grow through collisions during their descent .",
    "let us suppose that they `` absorb '' all other grains on their way to the midplane .",
    "when a grain moves a distance @xmath107 , its mass then increases by @xmath108 , where @xmath109 if the mass density of solids ( dust ) in the disk .",

    "its radial drift velocity then can not be neglected .",
    "numerical simulations in laminar disks ( weidenschilling 1980 , nakagawa 1981 ) show that grains in the process of settling toward the midplane undergo a significant radial drift which promotes collisions .",
    "this enables them to grow further up to 0.11  m , and sedimentation is then found to occur in a few @xmath111  years ( sedimentation being faster for larger grains , as @xmath112 ) .",
    "note however that these simulations assume that the grains stick perfectly to each other , so that they agglomerate when they collide .",
    "even though the growth of the grains during their sedimentation is not yet fully modeled by numerical simulations , it is generally accepted that this process leads to cm / m sized particles around the ( laminar ) disk midplane in less than @xmath113  years .",
    "calculations including turbulence have been performed by weidenschilling ( 1984 ) .",
    "he found that the coagulation rate is initially much greater than in a non turbulent disk .",
    "aggregates quickly reach sizes @xmath1141  cm , but erosion and breakup in collisions prevent growth of larger bodies .",
    "these aggregates are too small to settle to the plane of the disk in the presence of turbulence .      before examining the processes that could lead to further growth of the solid particles ,",
    "let us discuss the timescale on which such processes may have to operate .",

    "the radial equation of motion for the solid particles leads to @xmath136 if we assume @xmath137 .",
    "this means that the angular velocity of large particles around the star is not affected by the gas .",

    "we comment that this is a general feature of a non magnetic gas and dust mixture that arises because the forces acting on the two components are the same at pressure extrema so that they can comove there without drag .",
    "to estimate the typical drift speed magnitude in the general case , we set @xmath139 then equation  ( [ pgrdmig ] ) gives :    @xmath140    where @xmath141 is the surface density of the gas disk .",

    "therefore , either the process by which sub  meter sized bodies grow to become planetesimals has to be very fast , or possibly special flow features , like pressure extrema or vortices , play an important role ( see below ) .",
    "note however that the calculation presented above is for a particle which is isolated . in a laminar disk",
    "in which a dust layer forms around the midplane , the drift velocity can not be calculated by assuming that the gas velocity is given by equation  ( [ vgas ] ) . in the dust layer ,",
    "the dust density is probably large enough that the gas is carried around at a velocity closer to the keplerian value .",
    "the relative velocity of the solid particles with respect to the gas is therefore smaller than what we have assumed .",
    "it is actually the _ collective drag _ on the surface of the layer which is responsible for orbital decay .",
    "the lifetime of the dust layer against orbital decay at 1  au is estimated to be @xmath155  years ( goldreich and ward 1973 ) so that the problem still remains .",
    "the process by which 0.1/1  km sized bodies form in the dust layer in a laminar disk is still unclear .",
    "safronov ( 1969 ) and goldreich and ward ( 1973 ) independently pointed out that the dust may concentrate sufficiently in the layer to undergo gravitational instability .",
    "this occurs when the toomre parameter @xmath156 ( with @xmath157 and @xmath158 being the velocity dispersion and surface mass density , respectively , of the dust ) approaches unity . in a typical disk ,",
    "this requires the mass density of dust to be @xmath159  g  cm@xmath36 .",
    "fragmentation of this layer then produces planetesimals which size is on the order of 1  km .",
    "the advantage of this scenario is that it operates very fast , on a timescale on the order of the orbital timescale .",
    "however , it was pointed out by weidenschilling ( 1980 ) that , if the dust density reaches such high values , then it dominates the disk in the midplane , i.e. it carries the gas at a keplerian velocity around the star .",
    "as mentionned above , because there is no pressure associated with the dust , it rotates at a different rate than the gas around the layer . in these conditions ,",
    "the velocity shear between the dust layer and the gas around it gives rise to kelvin  helmholtz instabilities that result in turbulence , even in a disk which is laminar to begin with .",
    "this leads to mixing of the dust so that the density in the layer is decreased and gravitational instabilities are prevented .",
    "this result was confirmed by detailed calculations by cuzzi ( 1993 ) who showed that rapid accretion of planetesimals by gravitationally unstable fragmentation on an orbital timescale is unlikely to occur until objects have already accreted by some other process to the mass of the largest known meteorite samples , if at all .",
    "note that if the disk is turbulent to begin with , settling is inhibited for particles below a certain size @xmath160  cm , as already mentioned above .",
    "the instability scenario has recently been revisited .",
    "sekiya ( 1998 ) showed that gravitational instabilities can occur if the dust to gas ratio is much larger than the cosmic value .",
    "youdin and shu ( 2002 ) have discussed mechanisms for increasing this ratio . in particular",
    ", they showed that gas drag in a laminar disk causes global redistribution and concentration of small solids as they drift inwards .",
    "this is because the drift velocity of these particles decreases as they move in to smaller radii .",
    "youdin and shu ( 2002 ) conclude that the dust to gas ratio can become high enough for gravitational instabilities to develop in less than a few million years .",
    "however , weidenschilling ( 2003 ) pointed out their arguements are based on motions obtained for independent particles and claimed that collective motion due to turbulent stress on the particle layer acts to inhibit concentration of particles and may prevent gravitational instability .",
    "recently , goodman and pindor ( 2000 ) discovered a secular instability that may lead to rapid formation of planetesimals in the dust layer .",
    "this instability is not driven by self ",
    "gravity but by drag .",
    "if the drag exerted by the ( turbulent ) gas on the surface layer is collective , then the drift speed of the dust layer varies inversely with its surface density .",
    "a slight increase of the mass of some annulus would therefore result in a decrease of its drift velocity , leading to the accumulation of the dust inflowing from adjacent larger radii .",
    "the instability , which grows exponentially in a frame moving at the unperturbed drift speed , leads to the formation of overdense rings on an orbital timescale .",
    "these rings further fragment to form planetesimals of size @xmath161  km at 1  au .",
    "however , turbulent stresses acting on the particle layer may act to inhibit concentration of particles in this case also .",
    "if none of the mechanisms described above operate , one has to rely on sticky particle collisions ( coagulation ) to obtain planetesimals .",
    "cuzzi ( 1993 ) argue that 10100  km sized objects can be formed through this process in the layer in about a million years ( also see below ) .",
    "note that coagulation and growth can be made more efficient if particles can be trapped in vortices or overdense regions of the disk .",
    "planetesimal formation in vortices has been studied by , e.g. , barge and sommeria ( 1995 ) , tanga ( 1996 ) and klahr and henning ( 1997 ) who found that growth was indeed much faster .",
    "but note that cuzzi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) make the point that dust density enhancement may only be significant for a narrow particle size range .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear that vortices can live long enough in disks for any dust densification process to be efficient .",
    "more recently , trapping of particles in the spiral arms of a gravitationally unstable disk has been examined .",
    "numerical simulations of 110  m sized objects in marginally stable , self  gravitating disks by rice ( 2004 ) show that the drag force causes the solid objects to drift towards the peaks of the spiral arms where the density and pressure are highest , in accord with the behavior predicted by using equation  ( [ pgrdmig ] ) ( self  gravity was not taken into account in this equation , but it would not be expected to modify the situation significantly as it acts equally on dust and gas ) .",
    "it is further speculated that the density enhancements may be sufficient for the growth of planetesimals through direct gravitational collapse .",
    "similarly , durisen ( 2005 ) suggest that the dense rings that appear in their simulations of gravitationally unstable disks are conducive to accelerated growth of planetesimals .",
    "however , there remains an issue as to the lifetime of these features in an unstable self  gravitating disk . in future years",
    ", more may be learnt about the feasibility of the processes discussed here through more extensive three dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "once planetesimals of radius @xmath161  km have formed , they proceed to evolve by processes of velocity dispersion growth due to mutual gravitational interaction , gas drag , disk planet interaction and collisional accretion of mass which results in the accumulation of massive solid cores .    it is believed that the process starts with some planetesimals entering a regime of runaway growth and forming a population of embryo cores .",
    "once these are massive enough to significantly increase the velocity dispersion equilibrium of the smaller planetesimals , runaway growth ceases and the system enters an oligarchic growth phase in which cores separated by 15 or so hill radii accrete at comparable rates . throughout these phases ,",
    "gravitational focusing plays an important part in making the accretion rates rapid enough that cores can enter the earth mass range within the lifetime of the disk on a scale of 5  au .",
    "after this , the cores can become isolated and processes like gap formation may come into play to inhibit further accretion . the mobility of the cores as a result of disk protoplanet interaction in the presence of turbulence may be important .",
    "note that , if the disk is laminar , rapid inward type  i migration due to disk protoplanet interaction poses a serious threat to core survival .",
    "thus the final accumulation of cores up to the 515  m@xmath162 range is still poorly understood . nonetheless ,",
    "if favourable circumstances exist ( see discusion and references in sections  [ sec : timescales ] and  [ sec : turbulence ] below ) , this may be possible within the lifetime of the gas disk and thus giant planets can form .",
    "a population of cores may be left behind to undergo gas free accumulation when the gas disk has disappeared .",
    "the formation time of the earth through this process is expected to be @xmath163  yr . in the outer solar system ,",
    "gravitational scattering of the cores can produce escapers leaving a residue to accumulate the remaining small planetesimals and form uranus and neptune in a few billion years .",
    "we now go on to discuss these processes in more detail . in doing so",
    ", we follow many authors and adopt a so  called standard , or minimum mass , solar nebula model .",
    "this has a gas surface density profile @xmath164 and 2  jupiter masses within 5.2  au ( hayashi 1981 ) .",
    "this is an estimate of the spread out minimum mass required to form the planets in the solar system .",
    "we further adopt a solid or condensate surface density of 1% of the gas surface density .",
    "the characteristic lifetime of the gas disk is between one and ten million years and giant planets have to be formed on this timescale in the solid core followed by gas accretion scenario .",
    "the gas disk is also believed to undergo outward angular momentum transport allowing accretion onto the central star in the manner of an accretion disk .",
    "associated with this is an effective kinematic viscosity , @xmath165 , the origin of which is most likely associated with turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ( balbus and hawley 1991 , 1998 ) . in the standard model , we adopt @xmath166 with @xmath40 being the well known shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) dimensionless viscosity parameter .",

    "note that isolation of the protoplanetary core , as it occurs at the end of phase  1 , may be prevented under some circumstances by tidal interaction with the surrounding gaseous disk ( ward  & hahn 1995 ) or by interactions with other cores ( chambers 1996 ) .",

    "it thus appears to result fom the core plus envelope nature of the models rather than details of the physics .",
    "when the core first begins to gravitationally bind some gas , the protoplanet is on the left on the lower branch of these curves .",
    "assuming @xmath356 to be constant , as the core and the atmosphere grow in mass , the protoplanet moves along the lower branch up to the right , until the core reaches @xmath335 .",
    "at that point , the hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium approximation can no longer be used for the atmosphere , which begins to undergo very rapid contraction .",
    "figure  [ pt99_fig ] indicates that when the core mass reaches @xmath335 , the mass of the atmosphere is comparable to that of the core , in agreement with bodenheimer & pollack  ( 1986 ) . since the atmosphere in complete equilibrium",
    "is supported by the energy released by the planetesimals accreted onto the protoplanet , the critical core mass decreases as @xmath356 is reduced .    for @xmath399 and @xmath400  m@xmath65  yr@xmath20 , the critical core mass at 5  au varies between 16.2 and 1  m@xmath162 as the planetesimal accretion rate varies between the largest and smallest value .",
    "the former result is in good agreement with that of bodenheimer & pollack  ( 1986 ) .",
    "note that there is a tendency for the critical core masses to increase as the radial location moves inwards , the effect being most marked at small radii . at 1  au , the critical mass varies from 17.5 to 3  m@xmath162 as the accretion rate varies between the largest and smallest value , while at 0.05  au these values increase still further to 42 and 9  m@xmath162 , respectively .    in figure  [ pt99_fig2 ]",
    "we plot the critical core mass @xmath335 versus the location @xmath204 for three different steady disk models .",
    "these models have @xmath399 and @xmath401  m@xmath65  yr@xmath20 , @xmath399 and @xmath402  m@xmath65  yr@xmath20 , and @xmath403 and @xmath402  m@xmath65  yr@xmath20 , respectively . here again , in each frame , the different curves correspond to planetesimal accretion rates in the range @xmath397@xmath398  m@xmath162  yr@xmath20 .",
    "similar qualitative behavior is found for the three disk models , but the critical core masses are smaller for the models with @xmath402  m@xmath65  yr@xmath20 , being reduced to 27 and 6  m@xmath162 at 0.05  au for the highest and lowest accretion rate , respectively .      for these models , subsequently denoted as of type  a , just as for those with planetesimal accretion as energy source , we assume the structure extends to the roche lobe or boundary of the hill sphere beyond which material must be gravitationally unbound from the protoplanet .",
    "there it matches to the external disk .",
    "thus the boundary conditions for these models are the same as those with planetesimal accretion as energy source .",
    "papaloizou & nelson  ( 2005 ) adopt disk parameters appropriate to 5  au from the disk model of papaloizou & terquem  ( 1999 ) with @xmath404 ( shakura and sunyaev  1973 ) and steady sate accretion rate of @xmath405  m@xmath162  yr@xmath20 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath406  k and @xmath407  dyn  @xmath184 .    for models of type",
    "a , specification of the core mass and the total mass @xmath380 is enough to enable it to be constructed .",
    "this is because , although the luminosity is apparently an additional parameter , the degree of freedom associated with it is specified by the requirement that the radius of the planet atmosphere should be the hill radius which , for a fixed orbital radius , depends only on @xmath408 thus , the luminosity and the total energy of the protoplanet may be written as @xmath409 and @xmath410    for small changes in mass , the change in @xmath411 is @xmath412 if the change occurs over a time interval @xmath413 we must have :    @xmath414    this determines how the mass and hence the luminosity of the protoplanet vary with time and therefore the evolutionary track is specified .",
    "in contrast to embedded models of type  a , we can consider models that have boundaries detached from and interior to the roche lobe which still accrete material from the external protoplanetary disk that orbits the central star .",
    "detachment from the roche lobe and the development of a free boundary are expected once the planet goes into a rapid accretion phase .",
    "this is also expected because numerical simulations of disk  planet interactions have shown that , once it becomes massive enough , a protoplanet forms a gap in the disk but is still able to accrete from it through a circumplanetary disk ( see , e.g. , bryden 1999 , kley 1999 , lubow 1999 , r.  nelson 2000 ) .",
    "we thus consider models with free boundaries which are able to increase their mass and liberate gravitational energy through its settling .",
    "these models are referred to as type  b.    in contrast to models of type  a , for an assumed externally supplied accretion rate , models of type  b form a two parameter family in that , without specification of the energy source , and given their freedom to determine their own radius , they require specification of both @xmath380 and @xmath346 in order for a model to be constructed . thus @xmath415 accordingly , for small changes in mass and luminosity , the change in @xmath411 is @xmath416    now , for these models , matter is presumed to join the protoplanet on its equator after having accreted through a circumplanetary disk . in this case",
    ", we assume the accretion rate to be prescribed by the dynamics of the disk ",
    "planet interaction while gap formation is taking place .",
    "this is in agreement with simulations of disk  planet interactions where it is found that an amount of material comparable to that flowing through the disk may be supplied to the protoplanet ( bryden 1999 , kley 1999 , lubow 1999 , r.  nelson 2000 and simulations presented in section  [ dpi ] ) . in arriving at the planet equator , all available gravitational binding energy of @xmath417 per unit mass , @xmath418 being the surface radius ,",
    "has been liberated and so an amount of energy @xmath419 must be subtracted from @xmath420 in order to obtain the energy available to replace radiation losses .",
    "therefore , if the changes occur over an interval @xmath413 we must have :    @xmath421    thus , total energy conservation for models of type  b enables the calculation of evolutionary tracks through :    @xmath422 { dm_{pl}\\over dt } + { \\partial e\\over \\partial l}{dl\\over dt }   = -l . \\label{eveb}\\ ] ]    note that , as we regard the accretion rate @xmath423 as specified for these models , equation  ( [ eveb ] ) enables the evolution of @xmath346 to be calculated .",
    "thus , equations  ( [ evea ] ) and  ( [ eveb ] ) constitute the basic equations governing the evolution of models of type  a and type  b , respectively .",
    "note that any input from planetesimal accretion during and after the phase when the core becomes critical is neglected .",
    "we recall that after this point planetesimal accumulation proceeds by oligarchic growth ( ida & makino  1993 , kokubo & ida 1998 ) .",
    "n  body simulations of protoplanetary core formation indicate that obtaining cores of a high enough mass @xmath424  m@xmath162 to obtain evolutionary timescales within the gas disk lifetime is not an easy task to achieve during the oligarchic growth phase .",
    "this is in part due to planetary cores of a few m@xmath162 repelling the surrounding planetesimals and opening gaps in the planetesimal disk ( e.g. , thommes 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , it is reasonable to suppose that the formation of a series of neighboring cores may deplete planetesimals in the local neighborhood .",
    "we also note that if the slow down in evolution rate due to the long thermal timescale of the atmosphere can be obviated , a depletion of planetesimals brings about a favourable situation for shortening the evolutionary timescale as a potential energy source for sustaining the models without gas accretion is removed .",
    "the thermal timescale may be reduced by reducing the contribution of grain opacity from the interstellar value ( see figure  [ ev_fig6 ] , ikoma 2000 and papaloizou & nelson  2005 ) .",
    "if the grain opacity in the outer layers of the atmosphere can be reduced by a factor of @xmath425 the evolutionary timescale for a protoplanet with a 5  m@xmath162 core can be reduced from @xmath426  yr to a value within the expected gas disk lifetime .",
    "such a reduction may occur either because of grain depletion or because the grains have been accumulated into particles of larger sizes than the original ( ikoma 2000 ) .",
    "however , regardless of opacity , it is found that the evolutionary timescales for the type  a models decrease rapidly once the gas mass is about twice the core mass ( see figure [ ev_fig6 ] ) . at this point ,",
    "detachment from the roche lobe and transition to a model of type b is expected ( papaloizou & nelson  2005 ) .",
    "some of these are illustrated in figure  [ ev_fig7 ] .",
    "it is found that these models rapidly attain a radius @xmath427  cm for any reasonable accretion rate from the disk .",
    "furthermore , these protoplanets may attain luminosities of @xmath428@xmath31  l@xmath65 for a time @xmath429@xmath330  yr .",
    "gravitational instabilities in protostellar disks have been considered as a mechanism for forming giant planets since kuiper ( 1949 ) proposed that planets were formed through gravitational breakup of gaseous rings .",
    "the advantage of this mechanism is that it leads to giant planets on a very short timescale , on the order of the dynamical timescale .",
    "this is an important argument , as we have seen above that the build  up of a massive core may be prohibitively long in some parts of the protostellar nebula . also , some of the extrasolar planets discovered so far are very massive , with a mass several times that of jupiter .",
    "it is not clear that these objects can form through the core  accretion scenario , as gap formation inhibits gas accretion above some critical mass ( see below ) .",
    "it was initially believed that axisymmetric instabilities in disks would lead to the formation of rings that would further break  up into condensations .",
    "using the theory of viscous accretion disks developed by lynden  bell and pringle ( 1974 ) , cameron ( 1978 ) calculated evolution models of the primitive solar nebula which were unstable against axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "the parameter governing the importance of disk self ",
    "gravity is the toomre @xmath430  parameter which , in a keplerian disk , can be written as @xmath431 , with @xmath432 being the disk mass contained within radius @xmath204 , @xmath95 the disc semithickness and @xmath70 the sound speed .",
    "typically @xmath433 for protostellar disks ( stapelfeldt 1998 ) such that the condition for the importance of self  gravity , @xmath434 , gives @xmath435 .",
    "the characteristic scale associated with growing density perturbations in a disk undergoing gravitational instability with @xmath436 is on the order of @xmath95 , and the corresponding mass scale is @xmath437 , which is on the order of one jupiter mass for @xmath433 and @xmath438  m@xmath65 .",
    "there are , however , problems with forming planets through gravitational instabilities .",
    "fragmentation , which follows the development of axisymmetric modes , requires @xmath439 , whereas non axisymmetric modes develop for values of @xmath430 slightly larger than unity .",
    "as noted by laughlin & bodenheimer ( 1994 ) , it is unlikely that a disk would ever get massive enough for @xmath430 decrease below unity .",
    "the disk builds up in mass as a result of the collapse of an envelope .",
    "the @xmath430 parameter therefore decreases with time from high values . when it reaches values slightly larger than unity , non axisymmetric ( spiral ) modes develop .",
    "these lead to outward angular momentum transport ( papaloizou & savonije 1991 ; heemskerk 1992 ; laughlin & bodenheimer 1994 ; pickett 1998 ) that results in additional mass growth of the central star . therefore @xmath430",
    "is decreased and gravitational stability is restored . since the redistribution of mass may occur on the dynamical timescale ( a few orbits ) of the outer part of the disk , it follows that @xmath430 can never decrease to below unity unless the disk can be cooled down ( so that @xmath70 decreases ) or matter can be added ( so that @xmath141 increases ) on the dynamical timescale , which is unlikely to happen in the regions of planet formation ( it could happen however in the optically thin parts of the disk , typically beyond @xmath440  au ) .    nonetheless , condensations may form even if the disk is unstable only against non  axisymmetric perturbations , providing the density gets high enough in the spiral arms ( boss 1998 , mayer 2004 ) .",
    "there are indications , however , that the clumps that appear in the numerical simulations of gravitationally unstable disks are not long  lived ( see , e.g. , durisen 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the outcome of gravitational instabilities is very sensitive to the thermal physics of the gas .",
    "chemical composition dependence is expected but the correlation of the existence of planets with metallicity has yet to be demonstrated . when the equation of state is adiabatic , heating of the gas prevents the formation of clumps .",
    "in contrast , condensations form in an isothermal disk .",
    "but if the outer radius of the disk is allowed to expand under the effect of gravitational torques , these clumps tend to disappear , dissolving back into the gas ( pickett 1998 , 2000a , b ; boss 2000 ) .",
    "simulations including heating via dynamical processes and radiative cooling produce spiral structures that are less distinct than in isothermal disks and that do not collapse into condensed objects ( a.  nelson 2000 ) .",
    "although the question of whether the clumps can survive or not is still being debated , it seems unlikely that jupiter mass planets can be formed through gravitational instabilities in optically thick regions of disks .",
    "however , as noted in section  [ sec : planetesimals ] , the accumulation of solid particles into planetesimals may be assisted by gravitational instabilities in the gas disk through particle accumulation at pressure maxima in spiral structures ( rice 2004 , durisen 2005 ) .",
    "note that fragmentation may also occur before a disk is completely formed , during the initial collapse of the protostellar envelope .",
    "such opacity limited fragmentation has been estimated to produce objects with a lower mass limit of 7  jupiter masses ( low & lynden  bell 1976 , masunaga & inutsuka 1999 ) , but there is no definitive argument to rule out somewhat smaller masses ( bodenheimer 2000 ) .",
    "it is possible that both a disk and fragments may form simultaneously out of the protostellar envelope , the relative importance of the two processes depending for instance on the angular momentum content of the envelope , on the strength of any magnetic field ( so far neglected in disk fragmentation calculations ) and possibly on the initial clumpiness .",
    "large scale observations of class  0 envelopes so far do not rule out the presence of clumps with masses smaller than about 10 jupiter masses ( motte & andr 2001 ) . to explain the large eccentricities of many of the extrasolar planets , papaloizou & terquem ( 2001 ) and terquem & papaloizou ( 2002 ) have considered a scenario in which a population of planetary mass objects are assumed to form rapidly through a fragmentation process occurring in a disk or protostellar envelope on a scale of 100  au ( see section  [ multiplanet ] below )",
    "the discovery of the hot jupiters led to the realization of the importance of orbital migration .",
    "this comes about because of the perceived difficulties in accumulating a core directly at small radii interior to the so called snow line ( bodenheimer 2000 ) .",
    "instead , it is possible the protoplanet formed at larger radii and migrated inwards .",
    "so far , three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the location of planets at very short orbital distances .",
    "one of them relies on the gravitational interaction between two or more jupiter mass planets , which may lead to orbit crossing and to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller orbit ( rasio & ford 1996 , weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ) .",
    "however , this mechanism can not account for the relatively large number ( about 20% ) of short  period planets observed .",
    "another mechanism is the so  called migration instability ( murray 1998 , malhotra 1993 ) .",
    "it involves resonant interactions between the planet and planetesimals located inside its orbit which lead to the ejection of a fraction of them while simultaneously causing the planet to migrate inwards . to move a jupiter mass planet from about 5  au down to very small radii through this process",
    ", a disk containing about 1 jupiter mass of planetesimals , and thus about 0.1  m@xmath65 of gas , inside 5  au is required .",
    "such a massive disk is unlikely and furthermore it would be only marginally gravitationally stable .",
    "the third mechanism , that we are going to focus on here , involves the tidal interaction between the protoplanet and the gas in the surrounding protoplanetary nebula ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 , 1980 ; lin & papaloizou 1979 , 1993 and references therein ; papaloizou & lin 1984 ; ward 1986 , 1997b ) .",
    "below we review the possible main types of orbital migration associated with this tidal interaction . these are ( i ) type  i migration , which applies to an embedded protoplanet of small mass for which the disk response can be considered using linear analysis ( e.g. , ward 1997 ) , ( ii ) type  ii migration , which applies when the protoplanet is massive enough to open a gap ( lin & papaloizou  1986 ) and ( iii ) runaway or type  iii migration ( masset & papaloizou  2003 , artymowicz  2004 ) , which is a new form of potentially fast migration , applicable to massive disks , that could be driven by coorbital torques .",
    "orbital migration in each of these cases is induced by the angular momentum exchange with disk material that occurs through disk ",
    "planet interaction .",
    "this may be through wave excitation , as in type  i migration , a combination of wave excitation and shock dissipation , as occurs in type  ii migration , or direct exchange with disk material traversing the orbit , as has been suggested for type  iii migration .    in the appendix",
    "we give a simple description of the global angular momentum balance and conservation when a protoplanet in circular orbit is embedded in a gaseous disk with which it interacts gravitationally and consequently migrates radially .",
    "we show that the angular momentum exchange with the protoplanet can be accounted for by considering viscous and wave fluxes of angular momentum , that can be measured a long way from the protoplanet , as well as the difference between the rate of advection of angular momentum by gas flowing through the orbit and the rate of increase in the angular momentum content of regions in the neighborhood of the protoplanet because of non steady conditions . the angular momentum carried in wave / viscous fluxes",
    "is associated with type i and type ii migration , whereas the advected flux is associated with the more recently proposed type iii migration .",
    "we consider the timescales for the various migration processes and the potential problems introduced for planet formation theory .        here",
    ", we adopt a very simple picture of the angular momentum exchange process between a protoplanet in circular orbit and the disk .",
    "we work in a frame in which the protoplanet appears at rest at the origin . for a protoplanet in circular orbit",
    ", this frame would have to be in a state of uniform rotation and we should include centrifugal and coriolis forces to describe the motion of the disk matter .",
    "however , we shall neglect these and make a local approximation , supposing that a particle of disk matter approaches the protoplanet from large distance moving in a sraight line with impact parameter @xmath16 which we shall take to be much less than the orbital radius of the protoplanet ( lin & papaloizou  1979 ) .    on passing the protoplanet , the gravitational interaction produces an angle of deflection @xmath441 between the asymptotic tanjents to the trajectory of the passing element of disk matter . in the local approximation , the disk matter recedes from the protoplanet along a straight line inclined to the line of approach by an angle @xmath442    we adopt local cartesian coordinates with origin at the center of mass of the protoplanet .",
    "the @xmath208axis points radially outwards , the @xmath209axis points in the azimuthal direction in the direction of rotation while the @xmath210axis points in the vertical direction .",
    "we may assume that the initial trajectory is along @xmath443 approaching from @xmath444 with relative speed @xmath445 this corresponds to a disk with circular streamlines .    as a result of the interaction , a velocity component @xmath446 parallel to the @xmath208axis ,",
    "is induced .",
    "this can be found from the @xmath208component of the equation of motion in the form : @xmath447 where @xmath8 is the planet mass . assuming the interaction to be weak",
    ", we set @xmath448 @xmath449 and integrate with respect to time between @xmath450 and @xmath451 hence , the final induced @xmath208velocity is : @xmath452^{3/2 } } = -{2 g m_p \\over au}.\\ ] ] the angle of deflection is thus simply : @xmath453    associated with this interaction is a transfer of angular momentum between the disk matter and protoplanet . to see this",
    ", we first recall that , as the interaction between protoplanet and disk is conservative , energy conservation implies that the ultimate speed of recession is also @xmath445 accordingly , there must have been a parallel momentum transfer per unit mass of magnitude @xmath454 if the orbital radius of the protoplanet is @xmath455 the associated angular momentum transferred is :    @xmath456    we should of course note that this transfer is directed along the original direction of motion as seen by the protoplanet .",
    "thus , for disk matter on circular orbits interior to the protoplanet , the transfer is positive , while for exterior disk matter , the transfer is in the opposite sense and negative .",
    "the interaction is accordingly frictional , with interior matter speeding up the protoplanet and exterior matter slowing it down .",
    "note too that the trajectory prior to the local scattering interaction is assumed linear ( corresponding to circular orbit when viewed globally ) .",
    "subsequent returns of disk matter on circular orbit are required in order to make the frictional interaction persistent .",
    "the scattering itself , of course , disturbs that situation , so that there is an implicit assumption that dissipative or other processes work to restore circular orbits for returning trajectories .",
    "the indications from many numerical simulations are that disk viscosity is able to provide such an effect .",
    "the simple calculation of @xmath457 given above neglects the fact that the calculation should be done in a rotating frame .",
    "however , this has been incorporated in calculations by goldreich & tremaine  ( 1980 ) and lin & papaloizou  ( 1993 ) .",
    "as these calculations add nothing new with regard to the essential physics , we refer the reader to those works for the details .",
    "the end result is that the expression given in equation  ( [ deltaj ] ) is multiplied by a correction factor @xmath458 ^ 2 , \\ ] ] where @xmath459 and @xmath460 denote modified bessel functions .",
    "thus :    @xmath461      we may use equation  ( [ deltaj1 ] ) to evaluate the total angular momentum exchange rate with the disk . to do this , we replace the relative speed @xmath462 by @xmath463 where @xmath464 and @xmath207 are the angular rotation rates of the protoplanet and disk matter , respectively .",
    "given that we have implicitly assumed the interaction occurs close to the protoplanet , we adopt the first order expansion @xmath465    furthermore , each disk particle orbiting a distance @xmath16 from the protoplanet suffers impulses separated by a time interval @xmath466 we can thus write down the rate of transfer of angular momentum between the disk matter interior to the protoplanet orbit and the protoplanet by integrating over the disk mass as :    @xmath467    this gives :    @xmath468    here , @xmath469 is the minimum distance between disk matter and the protoplanet orbit .",
    "thus , there is an inherent assumption of a gap in the disk , or lack of coorbital material , which would have to be taken into account if the protoplanet is embedded in the disk and the interaction is linear .",
    "therefore , the above analysis is applicable only in a nonlinear regime when there is a significant gap , corresponding to type  ii migration .",
    "note that the sign is positive for the more rapidly moving inner disk material .",
    "for the outer disk material , one can see from symmetry considerations that the same expression applies but with a sign reversal because it is more slowly moving than the protoplanet and thus attempts to slow it down .",
    "a gap forms because angular momentum exchange occurs locally in the disk , on each side of the protoplanet , in such a way as to cause the disk material to move away from the protoplanet .    in order for a gap to be maintained",
    ", we should expect that the angular momentum exchange rate given by equation  ( [ jdot ] ) be able to balance the angular momentum flow rate due to viscosity .",
    "the viscous flow rate is given by :    @xmath470    where @xmath165 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath141 is the surface density of gas in the disk .",
    "of course , we recall that @xmath165 is not a real viscosity but a way of representing the flow of angular momentum resulting from turbulent stresses . from what we have indicated above ,",
    "we expect the condition for gap formation to be :    @xmath471    this is equivalent to : @xmath472    where @xmath473 is the mass of the central star , around which the planet orbits . to work with equation  ( [ gapvisc ] ) , we need to know what value of @xmath469 to use . considerations of the pressure response in type  i migration ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 , artymowicz 1993 ) suggests that there should be a torque cut  off leading to @xmath474 this is also a statement that pressure effects are able to smooth out smaller scale perturbations in the vicinity of the protoplanet .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by papaloizou & lin  ( 1984 ) who considered the linear response of a protoplanet orbiting in a disk already with a gap with lengthscale @xmath475 which was found to be the physical scale that led to the maximum angular momentum exchange rate .",
    "however , the condition for strong nonlinearity , which is required for local gap formation , is that the radial lengthscale of the flow can not be less than the hill radius , @xmath476 which being the largest possible scale of signigicant influence by the protoplanet gravitational field ( lin & papaloizou  1979 ) , must exceed @xmath477 accordingly , we should have @xmath478 taking @xmath479 and absorbing uncertainties in the constant coefficient @xmath480 equation  ( [ gapvisc ] ) gives :    @xmath481    taking @xmath482 this leads to : @xmath483    this condition is given by lin & papaloizou  ( 1986 , 1993 ) .",
    "but note that it is only expected to be accurate to within a constant of order unity . for a typical disk model , @xmath484 ,",
    "and we expect gap formation for planets slightly above the mass of saturn .",
    "however , note that rafikov ( 2002 ) argues that gap formation may occur for planets of mass as low as 2  m@xmath337 so far , gap formation at such low masses has not been seen in simulations ( e.g. , dangelo 2003 ) .",
    "this may be because rafikov ( 2002 ) suggested that a gap can be produced as the density waves excited by a planet become weak shock waves and dissipate .",
    "however , this occurs several scale heights away from the planet , beyond the region where a gap would be expected .",
    "furthermore , the angular momentum deposition from the waves also extends over a region of several scale heights , being wider than an expected gap . in this context , note that an annulus of width @xmath485 at @xmath293  au in a minimum mass solar nebula contains a jupiter mass , so that a planet of several earth masses could not redistribute its angular momentum without significant migration .      when the conditions for gap formation are satisfied , the outward flux of angular momentum due to viscous transport in the outer disk section is supplied by the planet .",
    "similarly , the outward flux from the inner section is taken up by the planet .",
    "when these contributions do not balance , the planetary orbit changes its angular momentum and thus migrates .",
    "normally , simulations indicate that the outer disk has the dominant effect , causing inward migration .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ type2_fig16 ] , taken from r.  nelson  ( 2000 ) , which shows the evolution of a planet of initially 1  m@xmath0 in a standard disk . in this case",
    ", the protoplanet was allowed to accrete as it migrated inwards on the viscous timescale of @xmath42  yr .",
    "inward migration on the viscous timescale @xmath486 is characteristic of type  ii migration driven by the evolution of the disk when the protoplanet mass does not exceed the local disk mass . in that case , using the standard @xmath40prescription by shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) , the migration timescale is given by :    @xmath487    if we adopt @xmath488 and consider @xmath40 in the range @xmath489@xmath99 , we get @xmath490 or @xmath113  yr at @xmath491 or 5  au , respectively .",
    "these timescales are much shorter than the disk lifetime or estimated planetary formation timescales .",
    "the expression of @xmath492 is independent of the protoplanet s mass and the surface mass density of the disk , but it is implicitly assumed here that the mass of gas within the characteristic orbital radius of the planet is at least comparable to the mass of the planet itself .",
    "if the disk is significantly less massive , the inertia of the planet slows down the migration ( syer & clarke 1995 , ivanov 1999 ) .      _  stopping type  ii migration at small radii : _ planets subject to type  ii migration would stop before falling onto the star if they entered a magnetospheric cavity .",
    "tidal interaction with a rapidly rotating star would also halts planet orbital decay at a few stellar radii ( where the interaction becomes significant ; see lin  2000 and references therein ) . both of these mechanisms have been put forth to account for the present location of the planet around 51  pegasi ( lin 1996 ) , and to explain the location of hot jupiters more generally .",
    "a planet overflowing its roche lobe and losing part of its mass to the central star would also halt at small radii .",
    "this is because during the transfer of mass the planet moves outward to conserve the angular momentum of the system ( trilling 1998 ) .",
    "the planet stops at the location where its physical radius is equal to its roche radius .",
    "recent observations of atomic hydrogen absorption in the stellar lyman  @xmath40 line during three transits of the planet hd209458b suggest that hydrogen atoms are escaping the planetary atmosphere ( vidal  madjar 2003 ) .",
    "+ _  `` the last of the mohicans '' ... : _ the mechanisms reviewed above can not account for the presence of giant planets orbiting their parent star at distances larger than about a tenth of an au .",
    "it has been suggested that migration of a giant planet could be stopped at any radius if migration and disk dissipation were concurrent ( trilling 1998 , 2002 ) .",
    "if the disk dissipates while migration is taking place , then the drift timescale may increase in such a way that the planet stalls at some finite radius .",
    "note however that this requires very fine tuning of the parameters ( disk mass , disk lifetime etc . ) , as for a given disk mass the migration ( viscous ) timescale given by equation  ( [ tii ] ) decreases as the orbital radius decreases .",
    "also , a major problem with this mechanism is to explain how the disk dissipates . within this scenario ,",
    "there is initially enough gas in the disk to push the planet down to some orbital radius . for typical disk parameters ,",
    "only part of this gas may be accreted by the planet or leak through the gap to be accreted onto the star ( bryden 1999 , kley  1999 , lubow 1999 , r.  nelson 2000 ) .",
    "it is therefore not clear how the gas disappears .",
    "a giant planet could survive if after it formed there were not enough material left in the disk for significant migration to occur .",
    "it has been suggested that a series of giant planets could actually assemble in the disk and disappear onto the star ( gonzalez 1997 , laughlin & adams 1997 ) .",
    "then at some point the disk mass may be such that one more planet can be formed but not migrate ( lin 1997 ) .",
    "this survivor is sometimes refereed to as the last of the mohicans .",
    "note that the prediction that the more massive giant planets that are able to form gaps should be predominantly at larger radii is supported by the observations . + _",
    "planets locked in resonances : _ orbital migration occuring for different planets at different rates , dependent on local disk parameters , can produce convergent migration and locking on to mean motion commensurabilities in a similar manner as is believed to occur as a result of tidally induced migration of satellites in the solar system ( goldreich 1965 ) .",
    "pairs of extrasolar planets have been discovered in such commensurabilities .",
    "gliese  876 ( marcy 2001 ) and hd  82943 ( mayor 2004 ) are in 2:1 commensurabilities while 55  cancri ( mcarthur 2004 ) exhibits a 3:1 commensurability .",
    "the origin of these commensurabilities is satisfactorily accounted for by disk planet interaction ( e.g. , snellgrove 2001 , lee & peale 2002 , papaloizou 2003 , kley 2004 ) . however , there is no indication that the existence of these commensurabilities slowed down or halted inward migration . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible that for some planet masses and disk conditions , resonant trapping of planets could lead to a reversal of type  ii migration .",
    "this has been suggested to occur when a giant planet ( e.g. , jupiter ) migrates inwards and captures a lighter saturn mass planet in 2:3 resonance ( masset & snellgrove 2001 ) .",
    "however , it is unclear how often and for how long such situations can be realized .",
    "we also comment that apsidal resonances in which the apsidal lines of two planet orbits are aligned , but not commensurable , could also be produced through disk planet interactions which are dissipative and therefore tend to select a particular normal mode involving non zero eccentricity of the planetary and disk orbits jointly , while the latter is present ( e.g. , papaloizou 2003 ) .      in this case ,",
    "one is concerned with protoplanets that are not massive enough to form a gap in the disk .",
    "we are therefore interested in calculating the linear response of the disk to an embedded orbiting protoplanet and using that to calculate the angular momentum exchange rate with the protoplanet .",
    "the perturbation exerted by the protoplanet on the disk propagates as density waves outside the lindblad resonances and is evanescent inside these resonances , in the corotation region .",
    "the protoplanet exerts a torque on the density waves , which , together with the torque exerted at corotation , is responsible for the exchange of angular momentum between the disk rotation and the planet s orbital motion . away from the lindblad resonances , the waves have a small wavelength , so that the contribution to the net torque is small",
    ". therefore , most of the torque is exerted in the vicinity of the lindblad resonances , where the perturbation has a large wavelength , or in the vicinity of the corotation resonance ( see terquem 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "thus , the torque exerted by the protoplanet on the disk can be calculated either by performing a full linear analysis of the excited waves in two or three dimensions ( see , for example , korycansky & pollack  1993 , tanaka 2002 , terquem  2003 , tanaka & ward  2004 ) or by summing up the contribution of point like torques exerted at lindblad and corotation resonances ( see , for example , goldreich & tremaine  1979 , artymowicz  1993 , ward  1997 , papaloizou & larwood  2000 ) .",
    "the results of full numerical simulations in general confirm the linear analysis ( e.g. , dangelo 2003 , bate 2003 ) .",
    "both analytical and numerical calculations find a positive ( negative ) torque on the disk ( protoplanet ) when the disk is laminar , circular and does not contain any magnetic field .",
    "this corresponds to inward migration of the protoplanet .",
    "the conditions for non linearity , or gap formation , have been explored by papaloizou ( 2004 ) using both local shearing box simulations and fully global simulations .",
    "a sequence of local shearing box simulations , incorporating mhd turbulence with zero net magnetic flux , which have increasing @xmath493 is illustrated in figure  [ sim_fig3 ] .",
    "the transition from being embedded to opening a gap is seen to occur when this parameter is around unity and it corresponds to the nonlinearity condition mentioned above that the radius of the hill sphere should exceed the disk thickness . when this condition is satisfied , the viscous transport condition given by equation  ( [ gapvisc1 ] ) is also satisfied in these simulations .",
    "the resulting dependence of the linear ( inward ) migration time @xmath316 and eccentricity damping time @xmath314 , calculated for a laminar inviscid disk as a sum of contributions from lindblad resonances , on the gas disk thickness is such that @xmath494 and @xmath495 .",
    "this scaling results in @xmath314 being much shorter than @xmath496 .",
    "accordingly , we expect circular orbits to be set up quickly and then migrate . but note that this may not be the case when the disk is eccentric .",
    "then the disk interaction is expected to lead to a finite eccentricity in the protoplanet orbit ( papaloizou 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , the migration direction may be affected .",
    "tanaka ( 2002 ) performed a local three dimensional calculation for a planet in circular orbit embedded in an isothermal axisymmetric disk that summed contributions from both lindblad and corotation resonances introduced through the vertical dependence .",
    "when @xmath497 and there is a central solar mass , they obtained :    @xmath498    results obtained from three dimensional calculations can be reproduced in two dimensional flat disk calculations if a gravitational softening parameter is adopted .",
    "when softening is introduced , the @xmath499 potential for the protoplanet is changed to @xmath500 the softening parameter being @xmath501 .",
    "this can be regarded as accounting for the vertical averaging of the potential over the vertical thickness and accordingly @xmath501 should be @xmath502    we note that for their two dimensional calculations , papaloizou & larwood  ( 2000 ) found that the torque results are dependent on the gravitational softening parameter used .",
    "then @xmath496 and @xmath314 scale as @xmath503 and @xmath504 , respectively , for @xmath501 in the range @xmath505@xmath95 .",

    "* equations  ( [ ttw ] )  and  ( [ mfit ] ) agree when @xmath511 and give * the characteristic timescale for migration of an earth mass core in the minimum mass solar nebula as about @xmath330  yr .",
    "this timescale decreases linearly with mass , resulting in a survival problem for proto  jovian mass planet cores . in this context ,",
    "even the smallest cores considered of 5  m@xmath162 have an infall timescale of only @xmath512  yr .    the resolution of this problem may be provided by magnetic fields .",
    "when they are present and produce turbulence with density fluctuations that can be of order unity , type  i migration may be stochastic ( e.g. , nelson & papaloizou 2004 , laughlin 2004 ) . in this case",
    ", the migration direction of small mass cores becomes indeterminate over the timescales simulations can be performed and the final outcome may depend on long term global fluctuations in the mhd turbulence which in turn may depend on the global disk environment .",
    "we comment here that it is not clear that the disk behaves as a laminar disk with the time averaged density , upon which noisy fluctuations , with a characteristic time comparable to the orbital period and which obey gaussian statistics , are superposed .",
    "if that were the case , it would be very difficult to affect the long term trend determined by the average laminar disk because of the large ratio of disk lifetime to orbital period .",
    "an additional recent investigation by nelson ( 2005 ) suggests that turbulent fluctuations occur on all timescales up to the global diffusion or viscous time .",
    "furthermore , the background perturbed by the planet is very different from laminar , with large density fluctuations encountering the planet and providing stochastic torques even when unperturbed by it . consider a density fluctuation of order unity with length scale of order @xmath95 a distance of order @xmath95 from the planet .",
    "the characteristic specific torque acting on it is @xmath513 given the stochastic nature of turbulence , one might expect the specific torque acting on the planet to oscillate between @xmath514 note that this exceeds the net specific torque implied by equation ( [ ttw ] ) by a factor @xmath515 ( r / h).$ ] from the discussion in section  [ sec : typei ] , the first factor should exceed unity for an embedded planet .",
    "thus , such an object is inevitably subject to large torque fluctuations .",
    "the strength of the perturbation of the planet on the disk is measured by @xmath516 this perturbation only needs to produce a bias in the turbulent fluctuations resulting in a non zero mean , corresponding to the typical fluctuation reduced by a gactor @xmath517 for it to become comparable to the laminar type  i value .",
    "also , global magnetic fields may be present and have significant effects on migration ( terquem 2003 ) , or the disk may have long lived global distortions corresponding to non zero eccentricity ( papaloizou 2002 ) which may also significantly affect migration .",
    "the migration rates may also be affected by opacity transitions in the disk ( menou and goodman 2004 ) . under some circumstances , significant fluctuations that can affect migration",
    "may occur in the non magnetic case for planets in the saturn mass range ( koller 2003 ) through the production of instabilities in inviscid gap edges .      to illustrate stochastic migration when fully developed mhd turbulence is present in a disk with with @xmath518 and no net magnetic flux , we show midplane density contours in figure  [ mhd_fig11 ] , taken from nelson & papaloizou ( 2004 ) .",
    "the presence of the protoplanet of mass 10  m@xmath162 is just detectable , although the perturbation it makes to the disk is of lower amplitude than the perturbations generated by the turbulence .",
    "midplane density contours for the same protoplanet in a laminar disk with identical parameters is given in figure  [ lam_fig12 ] .",
    "the disk response to the protoplanet is clearly much better defined in this case .",
    "the behavior of the torque per unit mass exerted by the disk on the protoplanet in the laminar case is illustrated in the left panel of figure  [ mhd_torque ] , taken from nelson & papaloizou  2004 .",
    "the upper line shows the torque due to the inner disk , the lower line shows the torque due to the outer disk , and the middle line shows the total torque .",
    "a well defined torque is produced , with an associated inward migration timescale in agreement with the standard linear theory .    by way of contrast",
    ", the right panel of figure  [ mhd_torque ] shows the running time average of the torque per unit mass exerted by the disk in the turbulent case .",
    "the upper line is the running time average of the torque acting on the planet due to the inner disk .",
    "the lower line is that due to the outer disk .",
    "the middle ( not straight ) line is the running time average of the total torque .",
    "the straight line is the total torque exerted on the protoplanet in the laminar disk run .",
    "the total time averaged torque does not converge to a well defined value over the simulation run time of 20 orbits .",
    "+    these simulations indicate that , if the disk is not strictly laminar , type  i migration may be significantly modified to the extent that the survival of protoplanetary cores may occur ( this is also the case if the disk is magnetic or / and with gas not strictly on circular orbits ) .",
    "furthermore , the enhanced mobility throughout the disk of a core undergoing stochastic migration may act to counteract the effects of core isolation ( rice & armitage  2003 ) .",
    "however , considerable theoretical developments need to be made in order to confidently assess the outcome of these phenomena .      by coorbital torque , we mean a torque exerted on the protoplanet by disk material flowing through the orbit .",
    "this has been discussed recently by masset & papaloizou  ( 2003 ) and artymowicz  ( 2004 ) in a global context and by papaloizou  ( 2005 ) in a local shearing box context .",
    "one starts by considering a migrating protoplanet .",
    "when gap formation is only partial , material will flow through the orbit .",
    "as it does so , a torque will be exerted on the protoplanet .",
    "this may either act to assist the migration ( positive feedback ) or retard it ( negative feedback ) .",
    "dangelo ( 2005 ) have recently studied coorbital torques acting on a saturn mass planet in a massive disk under a similar set up to masset & papaloizou ( 2003 ) .",
    "they used a multigrid system for which the resolution could be increased close to the planet , _ but not elsewhwere_. they report only slow migration differing only marginally from type  ii migration .",
    "this was claimed to result from important torques acting within the roche lobe .",
    "we firstly comment that their computational set up allowed mass flow into the roche lobe , effectively increasing the protoplanet mass by more than a factor of three .",
    "however , the increase in mass was not incorporated in the action of the protoplanet on the disk to determine its response , making the calculation inconsistent . furthermore the results , checked with the highest resolution , shown in their figure 14 , which differ from those used to draw final conclusions ,",
    "indicate a fast inward migration time of @xmath519 orbits .",
    "this would not indicate important contributions from inside the roche lobe as one would expect when there is not an increasing accumulation of mass there ( see the appendix ) .",
    "however , the study of the migration of partially gap forming planets of modest mass , with a disk mass comparable to their own in the coorbital region , is difficult numerically and clearly further work on the problem is required .",
    "masset & papaloizou  ( 2003 ) argue for positive feedback from coorbital torques because , for an outwardly migrating protoplanet , material traverses the coorbital zone from outside to inside .",
    "as it does so , it moves along the outer boundary of the coorbital zone occupied by material librating around the coorbital equilibrium ( lagrange ) points passing close to the protoplanet .",
    "as this passage occurs , angular momentum is transferred to the protoplanet , a process which acts to assist the migration of the protoplanet and which accordingly gives a positive feedback .",
    "we now look at this process in more detail for an outwardly migrating protoplanet .",
    "similar considerations apply with appropriate sign reversals to an inwardly migrating protoplanet .",
    "the expected force exerted on the protoplanet by material flowing through the coorbital region is estimated as follows .",
    "the rate at which the mass flows through is @xmath520 the outward momentum per unit mass imparted to the protoplanet when the disk matter moves across the coorbital region of width @xmath521 is @xmath522 where @xmath464 is the rotation rate of the protoplanet .",
    "we adopt @xmath523 , being appropriate for marginal gap formation .",
    "then , the rate of transfer of momentum to the planet is @xmath524 this can be expressed as :    @xmath525    where @xmath70 is the sound speed . using @xmath526 , it may also be written in the form :    @xmath527    where @xmath528 is the disk mass that would fill the coorbital zone of width @xmath529",
    "were it to do so at the background surface density .",
    "however , torques on the protoplanet do not only arise from material passing through the coorbital zone .",
    "material that is forced to comove with the protoplanet , either because it has been accreted by it , or because it librates about coorbital equilibrium points , has to be acted on by the same force per unit mass as the protoplanet so as to maintain its migration .",
    "this results in an additional force acting on the protoplanet given by :    @xmath530    where @xmath531 is the coorbital bound mass . the total force",
    "so far is thus :    @xmath532    however , there are other forces . the forces acting due to density waves from the two sides",
    "will be affected by the migration and flow through and thus differ from the non migrating case . in this context , note that there is an associated asymmetry in the surface density profile .",
    "thus , we should expect a wave torque component which is proportional to the migration speed .",
    "the indication from our simulations is that this acts as a drag on the protoplanet , as does @xmath533 accordingly , we shall consider the effects of asymmetric wave torques as modifying the value of @xmath534 and continue to use equation  ( [ crto ] ) .",
    "suppose now that the protoplanet is acted on by some external torque @xmath535 the equation of motion governing the migration of the protoplanet of mass @xmath8 with speed @xmath536 , obtained by considering the conservation of angular momentum , is :    @xmath537    accordingly , we can consider the planet to move with an effective mass :    @xmath538    the quantity @xmath539 has been called the coorbital mass deficit by masset & papaloizou  ( 2003 ) .",
    "when this is positive , there is an effective reduction in the inertia of the protoplanet .",
    "if there were no asymmetry in wave torques , the coorbital mass deficit would be the amount of mass evacuated from the gap region were it to be initially filled with the background density .",
    "gap filling accordingly reduces the coorbital mass deficit .",
    "it is also clear that , because at least a partial gap is required , the protoplanet must be massive enough to produce a nonlinear response in the disk .",
    "masset & papaloizou  ( 2003 ) and papaloizou  ( 2005 ) indeed found the coorbital mass deficit to be positive , resulting in positive feedback from coorbital torques .",
    "they also found that , in some circumstances , the coorbital mass deficit could become as large as the planet mass , so reducing the effective inertia to zero . under these circumstances ,",
    "a very fast or runaway migration may occur . because the coorbital mass deficit is proportional to the disk surface density",
    ", the phenomenon requires a massive disk , typically an order of magnitude larger than the minimum mass solar nebula .",
    "an interesting feature of this type of migration is that it is most effective for protoplanets that bare marginally gap forming , and thus in the mass range 0.10.3  m@xmath540 such forming protoplanets may undergo a period of fast migration that brings them into the inner regions of the disk , where gap formation is easier , while they are still of sub  jovian mass .",
    "it may thus form an explanation of why the hot jupiters are in general sub  jovian in mass ( see masset & papaloizou  2003 and papaloizou & nelson  2005 ) .",
    "but note in this context that this explanation does not necessarily require type iii  migration , as migration rates tend to be maximal in the mass range 0.10.3  m@xmath0 for low mass disks too ( see dangelo 2003 ) while lower masses may have migration inhibited by turbulence ( nelson & papaloizou 2004 ) .",
    "a graphical summary of the different types of migration is shown in figure  [ sum_fig8 ] .",
    "this shows the migration timescale as a function of protoplanet mass assuming a core of a constant mass of 15  m@xmath337 it allows for the possibility of type  i , type  ii and type  iii migration .",
    "it indicates that in order for a planet to form , type  i migration , which produces radial infall timescales much shorter than the protoplanet growth time , has to be strongly suppressed relative to the prediction derived from a non magnetic , laminar and circular disk .",
    "however , beyond type  i migration , survivability , at least to enable the formation of the planet , is not threatened on account of the shortened growth times .",
    "this is the case even if type  iii migration operates .",
    "the presence of high orbital eccentricities amongst extrasolar planets is suggestive of a strong orbital relaxation or scattering process . for this to happen",
    ", formation must occur on a timescale short enough that strong dynamical interactions may take place subsequently .",
    "the gaseous environment of a disk may act to inhibit such interactions until it is removed .",
    "gas free dynamical interactions of coplanar protoplanets formed on neighboring circular orbits have been considered by weidenschilling & marzari  ( 1996 ) and rasio & ford  ( 1996 ) .",
    "these may produce close scatterings and high eccentricities , but the observed distribution of extrasolar planets is not reproduced .",
    "papaloizou & terquem  ( 2001 , see also adams & laughlin 2003 ) investigate a scenario in which @xmath541 planetary objects in the range of several jupiter masses are assumed to form rapidly through fragmentation or gravitational instability occurring in a disk or protostellar envelope on a scale of @xmath542  au .",
    "if these objects are put down in circular orbits about a solar mass star , at random in a volume contained within a spherical shell with inner and outer radii of @xmath543 and @xmath544 respectively , a strong relaxation on a timescale @xmath545 orbits occurs , leading to independence of details of initial conditions .    for the range of values of @xmath546 considered ,",

    "but , as illustrated in figure  [ rel_fig6 ] , for a mutual orbital inclination of 60@xmath565 , a cycle is found in which the inner eccentricity reaches its observed value .",
    "as mentioned above , three  of the observed multiple systems have a planet with a mass larger than 4.5  m@xmath0 . in two of these systems",
    "( hd  74156 and hd  38529 ) , the massive planet has a semi  major axis on the order of 3.5  au and a significant eccentricity .",
    "the companion has a lower mass , a semi  major axis in the range 0.10.3  au and also a significant eccentricity .",
    "these systems may be explained by the scenario presented here .",
    "the recent observations of extrasolar planets strongly suggest that gravitational interactions between forming planets and the nebula in which they are embedded form a key element in the understanding of the configurations of the systems . given that the hot jupiters have almost certainly not formed where",
    "they are observed today , they must have been subject to some orbital migration resulting from planet / disk tidal interaction .",
    "this type of interaction also leads to commensurable pairs of planets and apsidal resonances , features that are also observed in some extrasolar systems .",
    "a substantial amount of work aimed at gaining a better understanding of planet / disk tidal interactions has been done in the last ten years .",
    "three dimensional numerical simulations incorporating internally generated mhd turbulence rather than anomalous viscosity prescriptions have begun .",
    "they show that orbital migration is strongly affected by such processes , especially when the mass is in the earth mass range .",
    "analytical and numerical work has also shown that the presence of a large scale magnetic field or a finite orbital eccentricity can have a significant effect on migration .",
    "strong gravitational interactions amongst a population of distant giant planets formed early in the life of the protostellar disk through gravitational fragmentation may also produce close orbiters and planets on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "the latter may belong to the original distribution or be formed by a later accumulation in an inner disk .",
    "we are currently at a stage where the important processes ( gravitational instability , dust sedimentation , core accumulation , gas accretion and disk / planet interaction ) can be studied in detail individually through numerical simulations .",
    "however , it is still not possible to take into account all of these processes acting simultaneously in a system with many embryos , to try to model the evolution of planetary systems from birth to final state .",
    "this would require very complex global simulations that can not yet be performed .",
    "also , for planetary systems , the evolutionary outcome , in the form of planetary masses and orbital configuration , depends very much on the initial conditions .",
    "the amount of mass present in the disk when planets begin to form is important in relation to gravitational instabilities , solid core masses that can be accumulated and migration rates .",
    "improved understanding will come as more powerful computers become available and observations put more constraints on realisable initial conditions .",

    "we here consider a protoplanet in , either , a fixed circular orbit , or migrating in a circular orbit with slowly varying radius , that is embedded in and interacting with a gaseous disk .",
    "we show that under very general assumptions , the torque exerted between protoplanet and disk can be expressed as a combination of advective wave and viscous fluxes evaluated far from the protoplanet , together with a contribution accounting for the rate of change of angular momentum of the disk domain in the neighbourhod of the protoplanet when conditions are non stationary . in this way",
    ", the contributions relevant to different types of migration can be identified .    in order to proceed , we need to consider the problem set up and distinguish between disk and protoplanet .",
    "it has been a common practice to treat the protoplanet as providing a forcing of the disk with a softened point mass potential . in that case",
    ", one may regard all the gas as belonging to the disk and identify the protoplanet mass as that associated with the potential , but only as long as the gas mass within a softening lengthscale of the protoplanet centre is negligible compared with that of the protoplanet .",
    "another possibility would be to regard the protoplanet as residing interior to some domain within its roche lobe . in that case",
    ", we consider the outer disk material to be unable to enter this domain or transmit angular momentum interior to it .",
    "thus , the protoplanet itself does not change its mass or angular momentum through interacting with disk material at its boundary .",
    "but note that when this domain is well inside the roche lobe , mass and angular momentum can still accumulate inside the roche lobe but exterior to the protoplanet .",
    "adopting cylindrical coordinates @xmath573 with origin at the central star of mass @xmath574 we consider a protoplanet orbiting in a disk with uniform angular velocity @xmath575 where @xmath576 is the unit vector in the vertical @xmath210 direction , relative to an inertial frame .            respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath579 are the disk density and velocity , respectively .",
    "the pressure is @xmath340 , @xmath580 is the gravitational potential due to the central object together with the centrifugal potential and @xmath581 is the gravitational potential due to the orbiting protoplanet .    the force per unit volume @xmath582 is taken to be the divergence of a stress tensor , @xmath583 thus , in cartesian coordinates @xmath584 for which @xmath585 @xmath586 where we have used the einstein summation convention .",
    "different effects may contribute to @xmath587 including navier stokes viscosity in a laminar disk , self  gravity in a massive disk , or maxwell stresses in a magnetised disk .",
    "we may derive the relationship between the total torque acting between disk and protoplanet and wave and advected angular momentum fluxes in the disk by considering global angular momentum conservation . to do this , we start from the local conservation expressed by the azimuthal component of the equation of motion  ( [ amot ] ) in the form",
    ":      on multiplying by @xmath589 and integrating over a fixed domain @xmath590 including the protoplanet but with a non interacting core cut out if needed , we obtain a statement of the total angular momentum conservation which , for an assumed steady state , takes the form :                            here the overline denotes azimuthal and vertical averaging with weight @xmath602 the first term can be identified as a wave or viscous flux ( see for example papaloizou and lin 1984 ) , as can @xmath603 the second term may also be written as @xmath604 with @xmath605 being the averaged specific angular momentum as viewed from the inertial frame .",
    "we shall assume the boundaries are far enough away from the protoplanet that @xmath605 may be approximated as the keplerian value .",
    "note that , in a steady state , @xmath606 is a constant .",
    "further . turbulent or fluctuating states may be dealt with through appropriate time averaging and we assume this to be carried out where needed .",
    "equation  ( [ jcon0 ] ) then gives the torque exerted on the disk by the protoplanet as :      in this case , the torque can be expressed as the difference between boundary wave and viscous flux terms together with the difference between direct boundary output and input associated with the constant mass flux .",
    "note that , when the protoplanet mass is reduced to zero , @xmath608 and we have @xmath609 here @xmath610 is the boundary viscous stress in the limit of vanishing protoplanet mass .",
    "this is just a statement that the advected angular momentum flow in a standard steady state disk is balanced by torques exerted through viscous , magnetic or gravitational stresses .",
    "thus , when a protoplanet is present , we have :          to consider a migrating protoplanet , we suppose now that the angular velocity @xmath207 is a function of time , as is the orbital radius of the protoplanet @xmath612 we adopt a coordinate system such that the protoplanet appears stationary .",
    "thus , this rotates with the time dependent angular velocity @xmath613 while the other coordinate directions scale with the orbital radius @xmath612 when conditions are quasi - steady , this corresponds to a self  similar solution .              where @xmath619 where @xmath620 is a constant with the dimensions of length that can be taken to be the value of @xmath338 at some time @xmath621 that can be chosen for convenience and the prime in @xmath622 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath623        note that we here assume that @xmath207 is a function of @xmath625 in fact",
    ", we shall use the keplerian form @xmath626 in addition , we shall adopt @xmath627 where @xmath628 is a constant of small magnitude corresponding to a slow radial migration . in that case , when the pressure and @xmath629 can be scaled appropriately , it is possible to seek a steady solution of equations  ( [ simcont])([simmot ] ) for the primed state variables that is independent of @xmath630 when the equation of state is @xmath631 with @xmath70 being the sound speed , assumed to be @xmath632 the stress tensor corresponding to @xmath629 scales as @xmath633 and the gravitational softening length scales as @xmath338 if it is being used , @xmath338 may be scaled out of the basic equations thus enabling a steady state to be sought .",
    "we comment that the last two terms on the left hand side of equation  ( [ simmot ] ) arise from the transformation to an expanding / contracting rotating frame . in this frame",
    ", they appear as the additional forces / torques required to induce the apparent modified disk flow .      as in the fixed orbit case ,",
    "we formulate the global conservation of angular momentum derived from equation  ( [ simmot ] ) .",
    "on multiplying by @xmath634 and integrating over a fixed domain @xmath635 , which is similar to @xmath244 but is defined in the primed coordinates , the azimthal component of equation  ( [ simmot ] ) gives the total angular momentum conservation in the form :                              here the overline denotes azimuthal and vertical averaging with weight @xmath646 the first term can be identified as a wave or viscous flux , as can @xmath603 the second term may also be written as @xmath604 with @xmath605 being the averaged specific angular momentum .",
    "again we assume the boundaries to be sufficiently far from the protoplanet that @xmath605 may be approximated as keplerian .",
    "in general , @xmath606 is a function of both @xmath647 and @xmath553 or time .",
    "however , in a putative steady state , as seen in the corotating comoving coordinate system ( primed variables independent of @xmath553 ) , it is a function of time only .        where we have combined the viscous and wave fluxes in @xmath649 thus the torque can be expressed as the difference between boundary wave and viscous flux terms together with the difference between direct output and input associated with the mass throughput in combination with the rate of growth of the angular momentum contained in the domain @xmath650 it is the latter two terms that are responsible for the coorbital torques . when the angular momentum change associated with mass throughput is not accounted for by an increase or decrease in the angular momentum content of the domain traversed , it is accounted for by the protoplanet disk torque , which means that there has to be angular momentum exchange with the protoplanet .",
    "let us look at this more closely .",
    "although conclusions do not depend on this , for simplicity we consider an assumed steady state self  similar case , then @xmath606 does not vary in space . but note that , from equation  ( [ jang ] ) , because of the dependence on @xmath338 and @xmath613 @xmath651 in this case we have :      suppose now viscous effects are small , so that @xmath606 as viewed from the comoving coordinate frame we use is due to the flow of matter induced by the migration .",
    "when the mass of the protoplanet is negligible , but the migration maintained , we expect that , as then there are no excited waves and @xmath653 :                  thus , as far as the orbital evolution is concerned , the protoplanet orbital angular momentum is reduced by the _ coorbital angular momentum deficit _ @xmath660",
    "other things being equal , this is expected to be positive if the protoplanet generates a partial gap , and in that case , once the effect of any asymmetric wave torques is taken into account , is clearly related to the _ coorbital mass deficit _ considered in section  ( [ coorb ] .",
    "there , it leads to a positive feedback enhancing the migration . on the other hand , if @xmath661 is negative on account of excess material accreted in the vicinity of the planet increasing the angular momentum content interior to the roche lobe , then the reverse effect of negative feedback occurs .",
    "note further that , if the structure interior to the roche lobe is quasi steady , and if the total mass of material there , not counted as part of the protoplanet , is small compared to that of the protoplanet , only a small contribution to the disk ",
    "protoplanet torque is expected from these regions .",
