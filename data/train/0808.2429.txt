    "epitaxial deposition of thin metal films on various substrates is of crucial importance in several applications ranging from the design of systems for heterogeneous catalysis and electron emission to the technology of semiconductor devices and magnetic recording @xcite . in several cases a significant mismatch between the lattice parameters of the deposit and",
    "the substrate is present .",
    "if the mismatch is not too large , the overlayer grows in a way that the atoms of the deposit are in registry with the substrate atomic structure and the growth is pseudomorphic .",
    "as the film thickness increases , mechanical strain energy builds up in the deposited film , which eventually can cause instability unfavorable to uniform flat film growth : the formation of dislocations or the continuation of growth in the form of islands become energetically favorable . in several cases epitaxially deposited film grown layer by layer can undergo a transition to a growth mode of three dimensional dislocation - free islands , which form on top of a layer of a certain critical thickness @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the critical thickness is material dependent and decreases with increasing the lattice mismatch strain @xcite .",
    "+ the structure and morphology of the deposited films is often determined by kinetic constraints rather than by the minimization of the free energy .",
    "however it is possible to work in experimental conditions that allow the system to relax toward the equilibrium configuration . in such cases",
    "equilibrium considerations may be useful to understand the physical interactions that are responsible of the film evolution and to establish the conditions for the existence of a critical thickness and its value .",
    "+ one can discuss the stability issue using a continuum model @xcite .",
    "the value of this approach lies in the fact that one can draw qualitative and some quantitative conclusions on general aspects of the growth without the need of a microscopical description of the atomistic mechanisms present in the process . within this model",
    "the stability of epitaxial films results primarily from the competition between the surface energy and the elastic energy , caused by lattice mismatch , since when a flat film surface is modified into a wavy shape the surface energy increases , but the elastic energy decreases .",
    "roughening of the surface and island formation can occur when it is energetically favorable to relax the elastic energy by increasing the surface area .",
    "it has been observed that since the surface energy tends to stabilize perturbations at low wavelength , while the elastic energy amplifies the perturbation at all the wavelength , any strained film , regardless of its thickness , should be unstable .",
    "this prediction does not match with the experiments which show the existence of a critical thickness beyond which the instability occurs .",
    "this suggests that some additional force has to be present that competes with elastic stress and stabilizes the film within a range of thickness of the order of few nanometers .",
    "long range forces , in particular the vacuum fluctuation forces between the interface and the film free surface , have been considered as a possible source of stability in the system @xcite . due to their peculiar size dependence",
    ", these forces are expected to play a role only at nanometric distances and when they cause a repulsion between the films boundaries .",
    "+ in this paper we discuss the conditions under which the vacuum fluctuation forces can contribute to deposited metal film stability .",
    "our purpose is to identify , both for the film and for the substrate , the range of optical parameters , that can determine the existence of a finite critical thickness below which the flat surface growth takes place . to this end",
    "we need a realistic description of the metal optical properties .",
    "recently we have reported on the results of a study of vacuum electromagnetic forces on thin metal films based on the plasma model @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the force may change in sign and intensity depending upon the film size and the nature of the substrate . however",
    "the plasma model does not provide an accurate description of the real metal dielectric properties , since it neglects both the intraband absorption of the free electrons and the effects on the interband transitions in the relevant frequency range .",
    "+ a more accurate description is give by the drude model @xmath0 which includes the parameters @xmath1 , the plasma frequency , and @xmath2 the relaxation frequency . for @xmath3 ,",
    "corresponding to infinite relaxation time , we recover the plasma model . while in the plasma model @xmath1",
    "is fixed by the valence electron density , the drude model allows to extract the parameters from the experimental data , thus taking into account both the real electron density and the effective mass of the electron in the metal under consideration .",
    "recently a careful study of the fitting procedure for au films , focused on the frequency range that is relevant in the determination of the forces due to vacuum electromagnetic field fluctuations , has shown that the drude model can be useful to reproduce optical experimental data for films prepared in various experimental conditions @xcite , thus allowing for a more accurate evaluation of the force .",
    "+ we start our analysis with a study of the force on isolated metal films .",
    "a free standing metal film is subject to a negative pressure i.e. an attractive force per unit area @xmath4 between the boundaries caused by zero point oscillations of the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "we have performed calculations of the vacuum induced electromagnetic force at @xmath5 for free standing films of different thickness using the dielectric function of equation ( [ drude ] ) and analyzed its dependence upon the optical film parameters . here",
    "we report on the results and on related theoretical aspects concerning the role of this force in the film stability .",
    "the study of the forces on deposited films has been carried out in two steps .",
    "first we have considered the force on a metal film deposited onto a perfectly reflecting substrate . in this case the force between the film boundaries , i.e. the substrate - film interface and the film surface , is always repulsive , independently of the film parameters , and the discussion on the stability issue , carried out with reference to standard values of the stress concentration and the surface energy , is particularly simple .",
    "we identify the range of parameters that permit the existence of a critical thickness in this ideal case . turning to real metal substrates we find , in agreement with previous work based on a plasma model description @xcite , that the force can be repulsive or attractive , depending upon the the difference in the optical parameters of the substrate and the film .",
    "an attractive force contributes to the destabilization of the flat surface growth and favors the island formation . in case of a repulsive force",
    "we provide examples of stability diagrams , which give the range of parameters that allow the system to remain stable , and we plot the corresponding critical thicknesses .",
    "our purpose is not to derive results for a specific system , rather we illustrate the conditions under which this force may be important .",
    "the expression of the vacuum fluctuations energy at @xmath6k in a configuration with two semi - infinite media of dielectric functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 separated by a film of thickness @xmath9 and dielectric function @xmath10 ( see fig.[refframe3 ] ) is given by the lifshitz formula @xcite .",

    "it is seen that the general shape of the curve is the same : the force is attractive and shows a maximum of intensity ( a minimum in the curve ) and a long tail at high frequencies",

    "the weakening of the force in the low plasma frequency range , can be understood using the small distance approximation to the lifshitz formula , that can be applied when the film thickness @xmath9 is much smaller than both the plasma wave length @xmath31 and the relaxation wavelength @xmath32 .",

    "the plasma wavelength is small and the condition @xmath41 is not satisfied .",
    "however we can understand the reason of the increase in the force intensity compared with the plasma model using the following simple argument .",
    "the vanishing of the force as @xmath22 goes to infinity as due to the exponential factor @xmath42 in @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see equations ( [ qtm ] ) and ( [ qte ] ) ) , since the fraction that multiplies the exponential goes to one both in the plasma and drude model ( this corresponds to the condition of reflectivity equal to one ) .",
    "we can write the exponential as @xmath45 , for high @xmath22 values we have @xmath46 , which shows that for the plasma model the exponential goes to zero faster that for finite @xmath2 values .",
    "this implies that both @xmath43 and @xmath44 go to one more slowly as @xmath2 increases , leading to a higher intensity of the force in the drude model for high @xmath22 values . +",
    "as previously observed @xcite the occurrence of a maximum is a direct consequence of the retarded nature of the interaction . indeed formula ( [ dsmall ] ) , which is obtained by neglecting retardation effects",

    "surface stresses can arise as a consequence of the different local environment of surface atoms with respect to those in the bulk : if they are tensile stresses they can originate a compressive stress within the film .",
    "if the compression is sufficiently large it can cause buckling of the surface with changes the lattice parameters of the outermost of atomic planes . treating the film as a continuum one can perform the analysis of the principal strains under the assumption that the film is in a state of biaxial stress @xcite . for an isotropic system , taking the @xmath51-axis normal to the surface of the film , one has @xmath52 and @xmath53 and , neglecting quadratic terms , the equilibrium strains are given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the young modulus and @xmath56 the poisson s ratio of the metal . in terms of the surface stress @xmath57 @xmath58",

    "typical calculated values of the surface stress are of the order of @xmath62 @xcite . taking typical values for the elastic parameters one can estimate the strain values for @xmath63 to be of the order of @xmath64 . to include the vacuum fluctuation forces",
    ", one has to carry out the same analysis adding to the surface and bulk elastic energy , the vacuum electromagnetic energy of the film .",
    "this can be done along the same lines , leading to the following expressions of the strains @xcite @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the vacuum electromagnetic force per unit area . as expected by a linear approximation ,",
    "the strain induced by the surface stress and the vacuum electromagnetic force simply add to determine the strain condition of the system .",
    "even if the contributions have opposite sign , the order of magnitude is different . for @xmath67 the maximum value of @xmath66 , as shown in fig.[fig4 ] , is of the order of @xmath68 , leading to strains of the order of @xmath69 , which are too small to compete with the surface stress effects .",
    "therefore , under normal conditions , the electromagnetic force does not contribute significantly to the free standing film morphology .",
    "for thicknesses of the order of few monolayers , the situation is less clear , since the electromagnetic force is expected to increase at least as @xmath34 .",
    "however in such cases a dielectric continuum theory is not adequate to represent the film optical properties , since size quantization effects become important .",
    "their inclusion leads to a very different behaviour of the dielectric function and to an expression of the force where the derivative of the film dielectric function with respect to @xmath9 has to be considered .",
    "the situation can be significantly modified if one consider the case of deposited films .",
    "previous work using the plasma model has shown that a metal deposited onto a perfectly reflecting substrate is subject to a positive pressure between the boundaries , that tends to increase the film thickness .",
    "this force turns out to be approximately double in intensity compared to the force on the free standing film @xcite .",

    "the behaviour of the @xmath74 factor , reported in fig.[fig3 ] , shows that the force is weakened compared to the plasma case .",

    "the critical thicknesses that have been reported in the study of metallic growth are of the order of few nanometers . in this condition and",

    "the point where the second derivative curves cross the horizontal line is the minimum plasma frequency that allows for the flat configuration to be stable .",
    "it is seen that , given the film thickness , flat surface stability is possible above a threshold value . on passing from the plasma model , where @xmath81 depends linearly on @xmath22 , to the more realistic drude description the stability threshold moves to higher @xmath22 values .",
    "this indicates that , even adopting a simplified model of the substrate , the conditions of stability depend critically upon the description of the film optical properties . + it is common practice to evaluate the vacuum energy contribution using the van der waals energy . as we noticed before",
    ", this is a good approximation only when the film size @xmath9 is much less that the plasma wavelength .",
    "if this condition is not verified , one obtains a rather inaccurate estimate of the critical thickness . to give an example we display in fig.[ctfig1 ] the @xmath86 values calculated with the full theory , and those obtained with the small @xmath9 approximation .",

    "it is clear from this analysis that the role of the vacuum forces in determining the stability if deposited films depends crucially upon the optical properties of both the film and the substrate . if a reasonably accurate description of the dielectric functions is not available , then it is hard to draw reliable conclusions on the expected surface morphology .",

    "we have shown that there is a variety of situations where these forces may play a role and we have expressed the constraints that have to be satisfied , in order to allow the maintenance of flat surface condition in the film growth , in terms of the parameters entering in the description of the optical properties of both the film and the substrate .",

    "the requirement that the force be repulsive as well as its intensity may or may not be satisfied for a film of the same material depending upon the value of the relaxation frequency , the change in electron density that takes place in the pseudomorphic overlayer , the surface scattering , etc .",
    "a definite assessment on the role of the vacuum force on a specific system can be made only when these effects are properly accounted in the film dielectric function .",
    "+ the present theory can be improved along two main lines of development .",
    "one can improve the continuum approach ( i ) by adopting a more realistic description of the elastic energy in the study of deposited film stability with the inclusion of strain modifications in the substrate and surface stress effects @xcite , which have been neglected in the present paper ; ( ii ) by including interband transition effects into the dielectric function , which are appropriate when transition metal or noble metal are considered @xcite .",
    "one can also extend the theory to deal with the case of metal film onto semiconducting substrate .",
    "+ for very small thickness , i.e. ultra thin films with @xmath117 , the theory has to be modified to include size quantization effects in the dielectric function @xcite .",
    "this is expected to lead to significant modifications in the vacuum force , due to the change in the film dielectric constant caused by the discretization of the electron energy levels .",
    "moreover for ultra thin film the surface energy is expected to depend upon the thickness .",
    "such modifications are consistent with the so called electronic growth model that has been frequently used to describe metal growth onto semiconductor substrate @xcite .",

    "we assume that , under suitable conditions , the film can be grown as a single crystal on the substrate surface .",
    "if the film lattice constant is identical to the one of the substrate and the substrate - film interface is perfectly ordered , than the film will grow with zero macroscopic strain . on the other hand , in case of lattice mismatch , and still assuming a perfectly ordered interface , the film will grow continuining the substrate structure and will be strained in the plane of the interface , fig .",

    "it is generally accepted that at @xmath118 it is the competition between the elastic energy and the surface energy that determines the morphological stability of deposited film : indeed when a flat film surface is perturbed into a wave shape , as indicated in the fig .",
    "[ appendice ] ( a ) , elastic energy decreases , but surface energy increases .",

    "the analysis is carried out for a sinusoidal surface considered as a perturbation of a reference perfectly planar surface , it is based on perturbation theory and on the assumption that the elastic constant of the film and the substrate are identical and in the absence of a stabilizing influence of the surface stress . for the two dimensional model sketched in fig.[appendice ] ( a ) , where @xmath40 is the surface position and @xmath119 is the reference plane and the sinusoidally wavy shape is described by a cosine function of amplitude q and wavelength @xmath120 : @xmath121 one can show @xcite that the stress concentration ( stress for unit area and unit length normal to the surface ) is related to the stress concentration @xmath76 for the planar surface configuration by the equations @xmath122\\\\ \\sigma_{zz}'(x , z)=\\sigma\\frac{4\\pi d q}{\\lambda^2}e^{-2\\pi",

    "notice that @xmath127 does not depend upon the wavelength and , being negative , gives rise to film instability for any kind of harmonic perturbation of the surface .",
    "+ the change in the surface energy density can be determined by multiplying the surface tension @xmath61 by the change in the surface length , which for small amplitude perturbations ( @xmath128 leads to the expression @xmath129 showing that the surface energy increases as the surface is perturbed harmonically .",
    "the comparison shows that , independently on the wave amplitude and the film thickness @xmath9 , the flat film surface becomes unstable when : @xmath130 the second member of this disequation giving a critical length below which the system is stable .",
    "inclusion of the vacuum fluctuation force leads to an additional contribution in the energy density that can be calculated to second order in the surface modifications as : @xmath131 adding this term to the previous ones and imposing the equilibrium condition that the total energy change be zero , one arrives at the following conclusions :    * the second derivative has to be positive , corresponding to a repulsive force on the film ; * the film is stable provided its thickness @xmath9 is lower than the critical thickness @xmath79 defined through the relation @xmath132    for film of very small size , one can assume a van der waals expression of the vacuum energy @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the hamaker constant .",
    "one obtains the condition @xmath135 which shows that the film can be stable only for negative hamaker constant ( repulsive force ) and it is inversely proportional to the stress concentration @xcite .",
    "+ extension of the theory to three dimensions does not modify appreciably the stability condition is a single wave perturbation is considered .",
    "in particular equation ( [ equicond ] ) is still valid provided that one replaces @xmath55 with @xmath136 , where @xmath56 is the film poisson s ratio @xcite . ab thanks _ cineca consorzio interuniversitario _ ( www.cineca.it ) for funding his ph.d . fellowship ."

    "<S> thin metal films are subject to the pressure caused by the zero point oscillations of the electromagnetic field , which depends upon the film optical properties and , in case of deposition onto a substrate , upon the substrate reflectivity . it has been suggested that this force may be relevant in determining the stability of deposited pseudomorphic films with respect to buckling or island formation . </S>",
    "<S> we present a detailed analysis of its behaviour as a function of the optical parameters and of the film thickness and we illustrate the conditions under which it may play some role . for free standing films it turns out that the film stabilization is basically due to the surface stress , which largely overwhelms the vacuum force . for epilayers on metal substrate the vacuum force may be important , and we give stability diagrams and critical thicknesses for several cases , illustrating how the flat surface growth may depend upon the film parameters . the importance of including retardation effects into the theory for a realistic determination of the stability conditions is also discussed . </S>"
