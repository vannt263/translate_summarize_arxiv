    "the lovsz local lemma ( lll ) is a general probabilistic principle , first introduced in @xcite , for showing that , if one has a probability space @xmath1 with a finite set @xmath2 of `` bad '' events in that space , then as long as the bad - events are not interdependent and are not too likely , then there is a positive probability no events in @xmath2 occur .",
    "this principle has become a cornerstone of the probabilistic method of combinatorics , as this establishes that a configuration avoiding @xmath2 exists .",
    "the definition of interdependency in the context of the lll is somewhat technical .",
    "is is stated in terms of a _ dependency graph _ @xmath3 , whose vertex set is @xmath2 .",
    "this graph @xmath3 must satisfy the following condition : for any @xmath4 and any set @xmath5 , we have @xmath6 that is , each bad - event @xmath4 is independent of all other events in @xmath2 , except possibly those which are neighbors of @xmath7 in the dependency graph .",
    "( in this paper , we let @xmath8 denote the neighborhood of @xmath7 in the graph @xmath3 ) .",
    "we note that , given a probability space @xmath1 and collection of bad - events @xmath2 , there is no unique dependency graph @xmath3 .",
    "rather , we suppose that we are given @xmath9 and some graph @xmath3 which is a dependency graph for them .    with these definitions",
    ", we can state the lll in in its simplest form , known as the symmetric lll :    suppose @xmath1 is a probability space , @xmath2 is a finite set of events in @xmath1 , and @xmath3 is a dependency graph for @xmath10 whose maximum degree is @xmath11 , and that for each @xmath4 we have @xmath12 . then if the criterion @xmath13 is satisfied , then @xmath14 .    for any collection of events @xmath2",
    ", we define the event @xmath15 ; we refer to this event as _ avoiding @xmath2 .",
    "_    there have been numerous extensions and applications of the lll since its original formulation .",
    "two themes will be relevant for us here .",
    "first , there is the generalization of the lll known as the _ lopsided lovsz local lemma _ ( llll ) .",
    "this was introduced in @xcite , which observed that it is not necessary for bad - events to be fully independent .",
    "if the bad - events are _ positively correlated _ in a certain sense , then for the purposes of the lll this is just as good as independence . more specifically , given a graph @xmath3",
    ", we say that @xmath3 is a _ lopsidependency graph _ for @xmath10 if for any @xmath4 and any set @xmath5 , we have @xmath16    a second extension of the lll is determining alternate criteria to ensure @xmath17 .",
    "for example , the asymmetric lll criterion can take advantage of situations in which the bad - events @xmath7 have different probabilities .",
    "( the symmetric lll uses a single quantity @xmath18 to upper - bound all the bad - events probabilities ) . in @xcite",
    ", shearer derived the most powerful possible criterion that can be stated in terms of the probabilities of the bad - events and a lopsidependency graph @xmath3 on them .",
    "we will summarize this criterion after giving a few relevant definitions .",
    "suppose we are given a graph @xmath3 on @xmath19 vertices and real numbers @xmath20 .",
    "then the _ independent set polynomial _ of @xmath3 with respect to base set @xmath21 , which we denote @xmath22 , is defined by @xmath23    ( in this definition , @xmath24 independent means that no vertices in @xmath24 are adjacent in @xmath3 ) .",
    "we can now state shearer s criterion :    [ shearer ] suppose we are given a graph @xmath3 on @xmath19 vertices and weights @xmath25 $ ] .    1 .",
    "suppose that @xmath26 and for all @xmath21 , we have @xmath27 .",
    "then for any probability space @xmath1 , and any events @xmath28 in that probability space such that @xmath29 for @xmath30 and such that @xmath3 is a lopsidependency graph for @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 + in this case , we say that _",
    "shearer s criterion is satisfied _ by @xmath33 .",
    "suppose that either @xmath34 or there is some independent set @xmath21 with @xmath35 .",
    "then there is some probability space @xmath1 and events @xmath28 in that probability space such that @xmath36 for @xmath30 and such that @xmath3 is a dependency graph for @xmath31 and such that @xmath37 + in this case , we say that _",
    "shearer s criterion is violated _ by @xmath33 .",
    "thus , shearer s criterion exactly characterizes what conditions on the probability of the bad - events and their lopsidependency guarantee a positive probability of avoiding @xmath2 .    while powerful , shearer s criterion is technically difficult to apply to constructions in combinatorics .",
    "there has been significant research in developing forms of the llll which are which are simpler to calculate , for example @xcite and @xcite ; these have led to improved bounds for a variety of combinatorial constructions .",
    "however , from a theoretical point of view , these are all weaker than , and are all implied by , shearer s criterion .      the llll is a general principle which has been applied to diverse probability spaces such as random permutations  @xcite , hamiltonian cycles  @xcite , and matchings on the complete graph  @xcite .",
    "however , by far the most common form of the lll and llll concerns what we refer to as the _ variable - assignment _ setting .    in this setting , the probability space @xmath1 is defined by a series of @xmath38 variables @xmath39 , which take their values from the integers @xmath40 ; namely , for each @xmath41 and each @xmath42 we have @xmath43 , and the random variables @xmath39 are all mutually independent . in this setting",
    ", it will suffice to consider atomic bad - events , that is , each @xmath4 can be written @xmath44    we abuse notation for such atomic events , so that @xmath7 is identified with the set @xmath45 .",
    "thus , for instance , when we write @xmath46 , we mean that one of the conditions of @xmath7 is that @xmath47 .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that if @xmath46 then @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "given any ordered pairs @xmath50 and bad - event @xmath7 , we say that @xmath51 if @xmath52 for some @xmath49 .",
    "we say that @xmath53 _ disagree _ on @xmath54 if there are @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "we write @xmath57 if @xmath7 and @xmath58 disagree on some variable @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "for such a probability space @xmath1 , there is a natural choice for the lopsidependency graph @xmath3 which we refer to as the _ canonical graph _ :    the _ canonical graph _ @xmath3 has vertex set @xmath2 , and edge connecting @xmath53 iff @xmath60 .",
    "the canonical graph is a lopsidependency graph for @xmath9 .",
    "consider some @xmath4 and some @xmath61.without loss of generality , let us suppose that @xmath62    by definition of @xmath3 , we can not have @xmath63 for any @xmath64 and @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    consider the following probability space @xmath67 : for each @xmath64 , we draw a random variable @xmath68 as bernoulli-@xmath69 and we draw a random variable @xmath70 , with @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "for each @xmath73 we draw a random variable @xmath70 with @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "all these variables are independent .    for @xmath64",
    "we define @xmath76 and for @xmath73 we set @xmath77 .",
    "now , observe that the random variables @xmath78 have the same distribution as @xmath79 .",
    "since the events @xmath7 are boolean functions of the random variables @xmath80 , we have that @xmath81    thus , in order to show @xmath82 , it suffices to show that @xmath83    we claim now that @xmath84 .",
    "this will suffice to show ( [ ff1 ] ) .",
    "note that the event @xmath7 is equivalent in @xmath67 to @xmath85 . also , when we condition on a fixed value for the random variables",
    "@xmath86 , then each event in @xmath87 is equivalent to a conjunction of the form @xmath88 .",
    "thus , @xmath7 is an increasing function of @xmath89 . by the fkg inequality",
    ", this implies that @xmath90 as desired .",
    "as we have noted , this setting from the llll is general enoguh to cover most constructions in combinatorics",
    ". some noteworthy applications of this principle include monochromatic hypergraph coloring @xcite and satisfiability @xcite .",
    "the llll ensures that there is a positive probability for the event @xmath91 .",
    "this is typically sufficient for the probabilistic method of combinatorics , in which the main goal is show that a configuration avoiding @xmath2 exists .",
    "however , usually @xmath92 is exponentially small , and hence the llll does not give efficient algorithms for _ constructing _ such a configuration .    in @xcite ,",
    "moser & tardos introduced a remarkably simple algorithm to find configurations for the variable - assignment llll setting :    1 .",
    "draw each variable independently from the distribution @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   while there is some true bad - event : 1 .   choose a true bad - event @xmath7 arbitrarily .",
    "resample all the variables involved in @xmath7 according to the distribution @xmath1 .",
    "they showed that when the asymmetric llll criterion is satisfied ( with respect to the canonical lopsidependency graph ) , then this algorithm terminates in expected polynomial time with a configuration avoiding @xmath2 .",
    "later work such as @xcite , @xcite showed that this algorithm terminates quickly whenever the shearer criterion is satisfied .",
    "thus , at least for the variable - assignment llll setting , this gives an efficient algorithm for nearly every construction based on the llll .",
    "in @xcite , we gave a different type of criterion for the termination of the moser - tardos algorithm .",
    "unlike the symmetric llll or other similar criteria , this can not be stated solely in terms of the dependency graph for @xmath3 and the probabilities of the bad - events .",
    "rather , it depends critically on the variable - assignment llll setting and the decomposition of bad - events into conjunction of atomic terms .",
    "we summarize this criterion , which we refer to as the _ lopsided mt criterion _ , here .    given an event @xmath4",
    ", we say that a set of bad - events @xmath93 is _ orderable _ to @xmath7 , if either of the conditions hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath94 , or 2 .",
    "there is some ordering @xmath95 , with the following property . for each @xmath96",
    ", there is some @xmath97 such that @xmath98 .",
    "[ var - assignment - thm ] in the variable - assignment setting , suppose there is @xmath99 satisfying the following condition : @xmath100    then the moser - tardos algorithm terminates with probability 1 .",
    "we note that theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] is superficially similar to the cluster - expansion criterion of @xcite ; the difference is that @xcite requires @xmath101 is an independent set of neighbors of @xmath7 ( which is typically , although not always , a weaker condition than @xmath101 being orderable to @xmath7 ) .    in @xcite , we also discussed a variety of combinatorial constructions based on theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] , which appeared to lead to stronger bounds than had been shown using the standard llll or its variants .",
    "we also showed in @xcite that theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] was always stronger than certain commonly - used variants of the asymmetric llll and cluster - expansion criterion .",
    "it was not clear in @xcite , however , whether theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] could truly be stronger than shearer s criterion .",
    "it is quite plausible that the improvement given by theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] is more along the lines of @xcite , namely , it provides a more accurate and computationally efficient approximation to shearer s criterion .",
    "we emphassize that shearer s criterion is a general result concerning arbitrary probability spaces ; one can not hope to provide a stronger criterion than shearer s _ for the level of generality to which the latter applies_. the strength of theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] comes from the fact that it applies to a _ less general _ setting ( the variable assignment llll ) , which is nevertheless general enough to encompass many applications in combinatorics .    in this paper , we will construct a problem instance for which theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] is satisfied , yet shearer s criterion is violated .",
    "in other words , it is impossible to deduce the fact that @xmath102 based only on the probabilities and interdependency structure of the bad - events ; it is necessary to take into account the decomposition of the bad - events into variables ( as is provided by theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] ) .",
    "we can summarize this situation as showing that the lopsidependent moser - tardos criterion can be stronger than shearer s criterion .",
    "let us consider boolean @xmath0-satisfiability instances , in which the number of occurences of each variable is bounded .",
    "specifically , in such a problem instance we have @xmath38 boolean variables and @xmath19 clauses @xmath103 each of the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 are distinct literals ( i.e. an expression of the form @xmath106 or @xmath107 ) .",
    "the goal is to produce a value for the boolean variables @xmath39 such that all the clauses @xmath108 are simultaneously true on the assignment @xmath80 . for each @xmath41",
    ", we define @xmath109 and @xmath110 to be the number of clauses which contain the literal @xmath111 ( respectively @xmath112 ) , and we define @xmath113 .",
    "such a problem instance can be be viewed as equivalent to determining the satisfiability of the formula @xmath114 the formula @xmath115 is in conjunctive - normal form , a conjunction of @xmath38 disjunctions of @xmath0 literals .    in @xcite , kratochvl , savick , and tuza",
    "defined the function @xmath116 as the largest integer @xmath117 such that whenver @xmath118 for all @xmath41 , then the formula @xmath115 is satisfiable .",
    "they showed the bound @xmath119 .",
    "a series of later works @xcite showed a variety of upper and lower bounds of @xmath116 ; most recently @xcite which showed the asymptotically tight bound @xmath120    the lower bound comes from the variable - assignment llll , and is perhaps its most important and exemplary application .",
    "the probability space @xmath1 is defined by setting each variable @xmath121 with probability @xmath122 , and @xmath123 with probability @xmath124 . for each clause @xmath108 , we have a bad - event that @xmath125 that @xmath108 is false .",
    "each such bad - event @xmath125 can be written @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath122 are selected in a delicate and problem - specific way . specifically , @xcite sets @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a carefully chosen parameter .",
    "determining the correct formula for @xmath122 was one of the major technical innovations of @xcite .",
    "this is counter - intuitive because one would expect that if @xmath130 is larger than @xmath131 , then one should be more likely to set @xmath121 ( as this will satisfy more clauses , on average ) ; the formula in @xcite does precisely the opposite .    while the bound of @xcite is asymptotically tight , it is still open to determine the exact value of @xmath116 .",
    "one might argue that for algorithmic applications , the asymptotic value of @xmath116 is not too relevant since @xmath116 grows exponentially in @xmath0 . in @xcite , we showed a slightly stronger lower bound on @xmath116 :    [ harris - bnd1 ] suppose that @xmath132 for all @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath115 is satisfiable , and the moser - tardos algorithm finds a satisfying assignment in expected polynomial time .",
    "in particular , @xmath133    the construction of @xcite is quite similar to that of @xcite , except that it uses theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] instead of the llll .",
    "it is possible a priori that the gap between the bound of @xcite and that of @xcite is due to the latter not taking advantage of the strongest available form of the lll .",
    "our goal in this paper is to show that this is not the case : the bound of ( [ harris - bnd1 ] ) can not be shown even using the full shearer criterion .",
    "we note that if the probability space @xmath1 is allowed to vary in a problem - specific way , then for any satisfiable problem instance we can always satisfy the lll criterion trivially : namely , @xmath1 puts probability mass @xmath134 on some satisfying assignment .",
    "our goal is to show that theorem  [ harris - bnd1 ] can be stronger than any bound using the lll ; since theorem  [ harris - bnd1 ] shows that the corresponding formula @xmath115 is satisfiable , then in order to show the shearer criterion is violated we must restrict @xmath1 to be problem - independent .    in both the lll constructions of @xcite and @xcite , the probabilities @xmath122 depend solely on the imbalance between @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the formulas for @xmath122 are slightly different in these two constructions .",
    "it turns out that the extremal case for both constructions is when @xmath135 , and in those cases we set @xmath136 .",
    "we are thus lead to define the function @xmath137 as the largest integer @xmath117 such that whenever @xmath138 and @xmath139 for all @xmath41 , then the formula @xmath115 is satisfiable .",
    "we clearly have @xmath140 .",
    "as our goal is to show lower bounds on @xmath137 , we may restrict the probability space @xmath1 to set @xmath121 or @xmath123 with probability @xmath141 .",
    "for this restricted case , we can also show simpler and slightly stronger bounds than were shown in @xcite , @xcite .",

    "also , the neighbors of @xmath7 in the canonical @xmath3 are bad - events involving @xmath123 for some @xmath64 ; as each literal occurs at most @xmath145 times , there are at most @xmath146 such bad - events .    thus , by the symmetric llll , it is possible to avoid all such bad - events ( and in particular @xmath115 is satisfiable ) , if @xmath147 which occurs iff @xmath148    [ fm - bound ] suppose that @xmath149 for all @xmath41 .",

    "we may form an orderable set @xmath101 of neighbors of @xmath7 as follows : first , we may set @xmath153 .",
    "second , for each @xmath64 , we may select zero or one bad - events @xmath125 which disagree with @xmath7 on variable @xmath54 .",
    "thus , we have that @xmath154    thus , a sufficient criterion to satisfy theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] is to have @xmath155    we choose @xmath156 to maximize @xmath157 ; simple calculus shows that this occurs at @xmath158 and that @xmath152 for @xmath159 .    with this choice of @xmath156 ,",
    "then simple algebraic manipulations show that ( [ ff2 ] ) is satisfied for @xmath160    thus , if @xmath161 and @xmath162 , then theorem  [ var - assignment - thm ] is satisfied .",
    "the second condition @xmath159 can be easily seen to be redundant , leading to the given bounds .",
