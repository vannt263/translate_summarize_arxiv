    "bound states composed of two heavy quarks such as @xmath5 and @xmath1 mesons , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 baryons ( @xmath8 denotes a light quark ) are of interests because they can be produced with sizable rates at the current high energy hadron or @xmath9 colliders .",
    "the standard model predictions of the production rates of these bound states can therefore be confronted with experimental data .",
    "the direct production of heavy mesons like heavy quarkonia and @xmath1 bound states can provide very interesting tests for perturbative qcd .",
    "the production of @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite at the tevatron has already raised a lot of theoretical interests in explaining the excess of the experimental data above the lowest order perturbative qcd calculation @xcite , especially at the large transverse momentum @xmath12 region .",
    "the ideas of heavy quark and gluon fragmentation @xcite have been successfully applied to explain the experimental data of the prompt @xmath10 production from cdf within a factor of five @xcite .",
    "various attempts @xcite using the same fragmentation ideas have also been made to resolve the @xmath13 surplus problem observed at cdf .",
    "recently , the preliminary cdf results @xcite also showed that the production rates of the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 @xmath17 states are in excess of the leading order calculation .",
    "while the @xmath18 and @xmath19 results can be partly explained by including the fragmentation contribution , the @xmath20 result showed an excess of about an order of magnitude over the qcd prediction even with the fragmentation contribution included @xcite .",
    "one subtlety is that the relevant @xmath21 for the fragmentation contribution to dominate should be larger in the bottomonium system than in the charmonium system , such that fragmentation is only valid for @xmath22(12)@xmath23 in the former case . besides , one has to worry about the very small @xmath21 region because , unlike the charmonium system , the experimental triggering conditions on the muon pair coming from the bottomonium leptonic decay allow experimentalists to measure the transverse momentum of the bottomonium all the way down to about 01 gev @xcite . in order to fully understand the @xmath21 spectrum of the bottomonium production , different production mechanisms have to be brought into picture to explain the production rates in different @xmath21 regions .",
    "the @xmath1 meson system , which is _ intermediate _ between the @xmath10 and @xmath17 families , is also an interesting physical system to study .",
    "the mass spectrum of the @xmath1 mesons can be predicted reliably from quarkonium potential models @xcite without introducing any new parameters and their decay constants can be computed using qcd spectrum sum rules @xcite .",
    "we will adopt the particle data group @xcite conventions , denoting the @xmath14 pseudoscalar ( @xmath24 ) and vector meson ( @xmath25 ) @xmath1 states by @xmath3 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "higher radially and orbitally excited states are labeled by the standard spectroscopy notation : @xmath27 , where the integer @xmath28 is the principal quantum number , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are respectively the orbital angular momentum , total spin , and total angular momentum of the bound state . in the @xmath32 coupling scheme , for each principal quantum number @xmath28 , the spin - singlet and the spin - triplet s - wave ( @xmath33 ) states are denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "those for the p - wave ( @xmath34 ) and d - wave ( @xmath35 ) states are denoted by @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , respectively .    according to the results of the potential model calculation @xcite , the first two sets ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) of s - wave states , the first ( @xmath42 ) and probably the entire second set ( @xmath43 ) of p - wave states , and the first set ( @xmath42 ) of d - wave states lie below the @xmath2 flavor threshold .",
    "since qcd interactions are diagonal in flavors , the annihilation channel of excited @xmath1 mesons can only occur through the weak gauge boson ( @xmath44 ) exchange and is therefore suppressed relative to the electromagnetic and hadronic transitions to other lower lying states .",
    "the excited states below the @xmath2 threshold will cascade down into the ground state @xmath3 via emission of photons and/or pions , while the other states above the @xmath2 threshold will decay rapidly into a pair of @xmath45 and @xmath46 mesons .",
    "inclusive production of the @xmath3 meson therefore includes the production of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 s - wave and p - wave states , and the @xmath42 d - wave states .    the production of the s - wave ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) states were first computed exactly to leading order in ref .",
    "@xcite at the @xmath9 machine , in particular at the @xmath47 resonance .",
    "later , it was realized @xcite that the complicated formulas in these complete calculations can be simplified by a factorization approach .",
    "the dominant contribution in the leading order calculation can be factorized into a short distance piece , which describes the partonic process of the decay of @xmath47 into a high energy @xmath48 pair , and a fragmentation piece describing how the @xmath49 antiquark splits into the two s - wave states .",
    "the corresponding fragmentation functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which are independent of the short - distance piece , were shown to be calculable by perturbative qcd at the heavy quark mass scale @xcite .",
    "recently , the production of the s - wave states has also been computed at hadronic colliders like the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) both by a complete @xmath52 calculation @xcite and by using the simpler fragmentation approach @xcite .",
    "we note that unlike the @xmath10 production in hadronic collisions in which the major contributions come from ( 1 ) @xmath53 fragmentation followed by the decay @xmath54 @xcite , and ( 2 ) gluon fragmentation into a color - octet @xmath55 @xmath25 state which subsequently evolves nonperturbatively into @xmath10 @xcite , the fragmentation diagrams for producing @xmath1 mesons form a subset of the whole set of @xmath52 diagrams , which are the _ leading - order _ diagrams for producing @xmath1 mesons in hadronic collisions .",
    "it is therefore not clear that if the production of @xmath1 mesons in hadronic collisions is dominated by parton fragmentation . however , detailed calculations by chang _",
    "@xcite , slabospitsky @xcite , and kolodziej _ et al _ @xcite indicated that the fragmentation approach is valid for the s - wave production at the large transverse momentum region",
    ". we will discuss more about this later in the closing section .    in this paper , we study the hadronic production of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "we compute the production rates of the s - wave and p - wave @xmath1 mesons at the tevatron using the fragmentation approach .",
    "intuitively , the dominant production mechanism of the @xmath1 mesons at the large transverse momentum region must arise from the direct fragmentation of the heavy @xmath49 antiquark .",
    "the relevant question is whether experiments can probe the transverse momentum region where fragmentation dominates .",
    "unfortunately , to answer this question it also requires a complete @xmath52 calculation for the production of the p - wave states , which is not available at the moment . here",
    "we assume that the fragmentation approach also works for production of the p - wave @xmath1 mesons in the transverse momentum range that is being probed experimentally at the tevatron .",
    "in this work , we do not include the contributions from the d - wave states because the corresponding fragmentation functions are very small @xcite .",
    "although the production of the d - wave states is of great interest by themselves , they only contribute about 2 % @xcite to the inclusive production of @xmath3 . in the near future , like other heavy quarkonia",
    ", the production of @xmath0 mesons at the tevatron may therefore provide another interesting test for perturbative qcd .",
    "although we will only show our results for the positively charged states @xmath1 , all the results presented in this work also hold for the negatively charged states @xmath56 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss in detail the general procedures to calculate the production cross sections using the fragmentation approach . in sec .",
    "iii we present the transverse momentum spectra and the integrated cross sections for the production of s - wave and p - wave @xmath1 states , as well as the inclusive production rate for the @xmath3 meson .",
    "discussions and conclusions are made in sec .",
    "iv . for completeness",
    "we also collect all the s - wave and p - wave fragmentation functions at the heavy - quark mass scale in the appendix .    before leaving this preamble",
    ", we note that a preliminary result from cdf had provided a hint for the @xmath3 existence by looking at the production rate of @xmath57 in the mass bin of 6.16.4 gev @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations of production cross sections in high energy hadronic collisions are based on the idea of factorization .",
    "factorization divides an inclusive or exclusive hadronic production process into short - distance pieces and long - distance pieces .",
    "the short - distance pieces are perturbatively calculable to any desired accuracy in qcd , while the long - distance pieces are in general not calculable within perturbation theory but can be parameterized as phenomenological functions , which can be determined by experiments .",
    "the factorization used here for the production of @xmath1 mesons divides the process into the production of a high energy parton ( a @xmath49 antiquark or a gluon ) and the fragmentation of this parton into various @xmath1 states .",
    "the novel feature in our approach , which is due to a recent theoretical development @xcite , is that the relevant fragmentation functions at the heavy quark mass scale can be calculated in perturbative qcd to any desired accuracy .",
    "this is easily understood from the fact that the fragmentation of a @xmath49 antiquark into a @xmath1 meson involves the creation of a @xmath58 pair out of the vacuum .",
    "the natural scale for this particular hadronization is of order of the mass of the quark pair being created . in our case , this scale is of order @xmath59 , which is considerably larger than @xmath60 .",
    "one can therefore calculate reliably the fragmentation function as an series expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath61 using perturbative qcd .",
    "the production of high energy partons also involves the factorization into the parton distribution functions inside the hadrons and the parton - parton hard scattering .",
    "let @xmath62 denotes any @xmath1 meson states .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath63 versus the transverse momentum @xmath21 of @xmath62 is given by @xmath64 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{*}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the physical interpretation is as follows : a heavy @xmath49 antiquark or a gluon is produced in a hard process with a transverse momentum @xmath65 and then it fragments into @xmath62 carrying a longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath66 .",
    "we assume that @xmath62 is moving in the same direction as the fragmenting parton . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath67 s are the parton distribution functions , @xmath68 s represent the subprocess cross sections , and @xmath69 s are the parton fragmentation functions at the scale @xmath70 . for production of the @xmath49 antiquark",
    ", we include the subprocesses @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ; while for the production of the gluon @xmath74 , we include the subprocesses @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . in eq .",
    "( [ * ] ) , the factorization scale @xmath70 occurs in the parton distribution functions , the subprocess cross sections , and the fragmentation functions . in general",
    ", we can choose three different scales for these three entities . for simplicity and ease of estimating the uncertainties due to changes in scale , we choose a common scale @xmath70 for all three of them .",
    "the physical production rates should be independent of choices of the scale @xmath70 , because @xmath70 is just an artificial entity introduced to factorize the whole process into different parts in the renormalization procedure .",
    "however , this independence of scale can only be achieved if both the production of the high energy partons and the fragmentation functions are calculated to all orders in @xmath61 .",
    "so far , only the next - to - leading order @xmath78 s and the leading order fragmentation functions are available , so the production cross sections do depend on the choice of @xmath70 to a certain degree .",
    "we will estimate the dependence on @xmath70 by varying the scale @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is our primary choice of scale @xmath81 this choice of scale , which is of order @xmath82 , avoids the large logarithms in the short - distance part @xmath78 s .",
    "however , we have to sum up the logarithms of order @xmath83 in the fragmentation functions . but",
    "this can be implemented by evolving the altarelli - parisi equations for the fragmentation functions .",
    "the altarelli - parisi evolution equations for the fragmentation functions are @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath62 denotes any @xmath1 states , and @xmath86 are the usual altarelli - parisi splitting functions .",
    "the leading order expressions for @xmath86 can be found in the appendix .",
    "the boundary conditions for solving the above altarelli - parisi equations are the fragmentation functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 that we can calculate by perturbative qcd at the initial scale @xmath89 , which is of the order of the @xmath90-quark mass . at present , all the s - wave @xcite and p - wave @xcite fragmentation functions for @xmath91 have been calculated to leading order in @xmath61 .",
    "they are all collected in the appendix .",
    "the initial scale @xmath89 for @xmath87 is chosen to be @xmath92 , which is the minimum virtuality of the fragmenting @xmath49 antiquark @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , since the initial gluon fragmentation function @xmath88 is suppressed by one extra power of @xmath61 relative to @xmath93 , we simply choose the initial gluon fragmentation function to be @xmath94 for @xmath95  the minimum virtuality of the fragmenting gluon @xcite .",
    "we can also examine the relative importance of these fragmentation functions .",
    "the initial @xmath93 is of order @xmath96 , whereas the initial @xmath88 is of order @xmath97 and has been set to be zero for @xmath98 as discussed above .",
    "but when the scale is evolved up to a higher scale @xmath70 , @xmath99 is still of order @xmath96 , while the induced @xmath100 is of order @xmath101 . at a sufficiently large scale @xmath70",
    "the logarithmic enhancement can offset the extra suppression factor of @xmath61 .",
    "thus the altarelli - parisi induced gluon fragmentation functions can be as important as the @xmath49 antiquark fragmentation , even though the initial gluon fragmentation functions are suppressed . while these altarelli - parisi induced gluon fragmentation functions",
    "play only a moderate role at the tevatron , they will play a more significant role at the lhc @xcite .    to obtain the fragmentation functions at an arbitrary scale greater than @xmath89",
    ", we numerically integrate the altarelli - parisi evolution equations ( [ db])([dg ] ) with the boundary conditions described in the above paragraph .",
    "since the initial light - quark fragmentation functions @xmath102 are of order @xmath103 , one can set them to be zero as well for @xmath98 .",
    "one may ask if the light - quark fragmentation functions can be induced in the same manner as in the gluon case by altarelli - parisi evolution . since both the altarelli - parisi splitting functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 are total plus - functions , the induced light - quark fragmentation functions @xmath106 can only be total plus - functions or vanishing identically .",
    "we do not anticipate that these induced light - quark fragmentation functions , if nontrivial , will play any significant role in our analysis .",
    "leading order qcd formulas are employed for the parton - level scattering cross sections and cteq(2 m ) @xcite is used for the initial parton distributions . the inputs to the initial fragmentation functions are the heavy quark masses @xmath107 and @xmath59 , and the nonperturbative parameters associated with the wavefunctions of the bound states . for the s - wave states there is only one nonperturbative parameter , which is the radial wavefunction @xmath108 at the origin . however for the p - wave fragmentation functions we have two nonperturbative parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 associated with the color - singlet and the color - octet mechanisms , respectively @xcite .",
    "two of the p - wave states ( @xmath36 and @xmath111 ) are mixed to form the two physical states , denoted by @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "further details of the mixings can be found in refs .",
    "the above input parameters for the fragmentation functions are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we have set the scale @xmath70 in the parton distribution functions , subprocess cross sections , and the fragmentation functions to be the same .",
    "we will later vary @xmath70 between @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where @xmath80 is given in eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) , to study the dependence on the choice of scale . for the strong coupling constant @xmath116 entered in the subprocess cross sections , we employ the following simple expression @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the number of active flavors at the scale @xmath70 and @xmath119 . in order to simulate the detector coverage at the tevatron , we impose the following acceptance cuts on the transverse momentum and rapidity of the @xmath1 state @xmath62 : @xmath120 the numerical results of the @xmath21 spectra for the @xmath1 state @xmath62 with various spin - orbital quantum numbers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the cases of principal quantum number @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the integrated cross sections versus @xmath121 are also shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] for the cases of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "now we can predict the inclusive production rate of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "as the annihilation channel is suppressed relative to the electromagnetic / hadronic transitions , all the @xmath1 excited states below the @xmath2 threshold will decay eventually into the ground state @xmath3 via emission of photons or pions . since the energies of these emitted photons and/or pions are limited by the small mass differences between the initial and final @xmath1 states , the transverse momenta of the @xmath0 mesons will not be altered appreciably during the cascades .",
    "therefore , we can simply add up the @xmath21 spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) of all the states to represent the @xmath21 spectrum of the inclusive @xmath3 production .",
    "similarly , we can add up the integrated cross sections ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .  [ fig4 ] ) to represent the integrated cross section for the inclusive @xmath3 production .",
    "thus , we can obtain the inclusive production rate of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath122 .",
    "table  [ table2 ] gives the inclusive cross sections for the @xmath3 meson at the tevatron as a function of @xmath122 , including all the contributions from the @xmath42 and @xmath43 s - wave and p - wave states .",
    "these cross sections should almost represent the inclusive production of @xmath3 by fragmentation , because the contributions from the d - wave states are expected to be minuscule .",
    "the results for @xmath123 , and @xmath115 are also shown .",
    "the variation of the integrated cross sections with the scale @xmath70 is always within a factor of two , and only about 20% for @xmath124  gev .",
    "we will discuss more about the dependence of scale in the next section .    at the end of run ib at the tevatron",
    ", the total accumulated luminosities can be up to 100150 pb@xmath125 or more . with @xmath126  gev",
    ", there are about @xmath127 @xmath128 mesons .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath3 meson has been estimated to be of order 12 picosecond @xcite , which is long enough to leave a displaced vertex in a silicon vertex detector .",
    "besides , @xmath3 decays into @xmath129 very often , where @xmath130 can be a @xmath131 , @xmath132 , or @xmath133 , and @xmath10 can be detected easily through its leptonic decay modes .",
    "the inclusive branching ratio of @xmath134 is about 10% @xcite . when @xmath130 is @xmath135 or @xmath136",
    ", we will obtain the striking signature of three - charged leptons coming off from a common secondary vertex .",
    "the combined branching ratio of @xmath137 is about 0.2% .",
    "this implies that there will be of order @xmath138 such distinct events for 100 pb@xmath125 luminosity at the tevatron . even taking into account the imperfect detection efficiencies",
    ", there should be enough events for confirmation .",
    "however , this mode does not afford the full reconstruction of the @xmath3 . if @xmath130 is some hadronic states , _",

    "the process @xmath139 is likely to be the discovery mode for @xmath3 .",
    "its combined branching ratio is about 0.03% , which implies about 300 such distinct events at the tevatron with a luminosity of 100 pb@xmath125 .",
    "after the next fixed target runs at the tevatron , the main injector will be installed in 19961997 according to the present plan @xcite .",
    "the main injector will give a significant boost in the luminosity while the center - of - mass energy stays the same .",
    "the upgraded luminosity is estimated to be about ten times larger than its present value .",
    "this enables run ii to accumulate a total luminosity of 12 fb@xmath125 , which implies that about @xmath140 @xmath3 mesons will be produced . with the main injector installed",

    "[ table3 ] , we show the inclusive cross sections for the @xmath3 meson at the lhc as a function of @xmath122 including the contributions from @xmath42 and @xmath43 s - wave and p - wave states . with the assumed 100 fb@xmath125 luminosity",
    "there are about @xmath141 @xmath3 mesons with @xmath142  gev and @xmath143 .",
    "with such a high luminosity at lhc , one expects sizable numbers of the various d - wave @xmath1 states to be produced as well .",
    "the lhc will then be a copious source of @xmath1 mesons such that their properties _",
    "e.g. _ , spectroscopy and decays , can be thoroughly studied .",
    "in addition , the mixing and cp violation studies are possible . for example",
    ", one can use @xmath3 to tag the flavor of @xmath144 in the decay @xmath145 for the studies of @xmath146 mixing .",
    "also , cp violations in the @xmath3 system can be studied by looking at the difference in the partial decay widths of @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "first , we briefly discuss the various sources of uncertainties in our calculation .",
    "one uncertainty comes from the use of the naive altarelli - parisi evolution equations . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the naive altarelli - parisi equations in eqs .",
    "( [ db])([dg ] ) do not respect the phase space constraints .",
    "inhomogeneous evolution equations were then advocated to remedy for these problems .",
    "the major effect is to correct the unphysical blow - up of the evolved gluon fragmentation functions when @xmath66 gets too close to 0 .",
    "the corrected gluon fragmentation functions , instead of having the unphysical blow - up at @xmath149 , turn to zero smoothly below a certain threshold value of @xmath66 . despite the dramatic changes of the evolved gluon fragmentation functions for small @xmath66 values",
    ", this effect will not show up easily in our calculation because the small @xmath66 region is very likely excluded by the transverse momentum cut imposed on the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "therefore , in this paper we keep on using the homogeneous altarelli - parisi equations in eqs .",
    "( [ db])([dg ] ) to evolve our fragmentation functions .",
    "a second source of uncertainty is due to the choice of the factorization scale @xmath70 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the dependence of the differential cross sections on the factorization scale @xmath70 by plotting the results for the various choices of @xmath150 , and @xmath115 . for clarity",
    "we only show the curves for the @xmath151 and @xmath152 states in fig .",
    "the behaviors for other states are similar .",
    "note that in the @xmath123 , and @xmath115 curves , the running scales used in the strong coupling constant @xmath61 , which entered in @xmath68 s and in the parton distribution functions @xmath153 s are equal to @xmath70 , while the running scale used in the fragmentation functions is set to be @xmath154 @xmath155 , where @xmath89 is the prescribed initial scale for the fragmentation functions .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows that the change in the factorization scale @xmath70 gives different results for the differential cross sections .",
    "the @xmath156 curves show that the differential cross sections increase ( decrease ) only slightly at the low ( high ) @xmath21 region .",
    "although the @xmath157 curves demonstrate larger changes in the differential cross sections , the variations are always within a factor of two .",
    "the integrated cross sections at various @xmath158 , as already shown in table  [ table2 ] , also indicate lesser sensitivity in the scale as one increases @xmath158 .",
    "the variations of differential cross sections with the scale @xmath70 demonstrate the effects of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections . only if all the nlo corrections are calculated for each piece contained in eq .",
    "( [ * ] ) , namely the parton distribution functions , the parton - parton hard scattering cross sections , and the fragmentation functions , can these variations be reduced substantially .",
    "since the perturbative qcd fragmentation functions are only calculated to leading order , the nlo calculations of the perturbative qcd fragmentation functions can provide an improvement to our calculation .",
    "however , due to the rather weak dependence on the scale in our leading order calculation , our results should be rather stable under higher order perturbative corrections .",
    "other uncertainties come from the input parameters to the boundary conditions of the fragmentation functions .",
    "these are the heavy quark masses @xmath107 and @xmath59 , and the nonperturbative parameters describing the bound states .",
    "slight changes in @xmath59 and @xmath107 could possibly lead to appreciable changes in the fragmentation functions , as indicated by the @xmath159 and @xmath160 dependence , respectively in the denominators of the s - wave and p - wave fragmentation functions .",
    "( note that @xmath161 . ) however , in the numerators the wavefunctions at the origin @xmath162 and @xmath163 also scale like @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "therefore the dependence on the heavy quark masses should be mild in the fragmentation functions .",
    "the color - octet parameters @xmath164 s are associated with the additional color - octet contributions and they are not well determined",
    ". however , we do not expect that they will play any significant role in the present context and only refer our readers to ref.@xcite where some discussions of these parameters can be found .    there was a controversy in the recent literature @xcite concerning about the importance of parton fragmentation in the production of the @xmath165 meson at hadronic colliders .",
    "the controversy arises because the feynman diagrams responsible for the @xmath49 antiquark fragmentation form a subset of the whole set of feynman diagrams , which contribute at the order of @xmath103 .",
    "thus , there is a competition between the fragmentation contribution and the non - fragmentation contribution .",
    "some authors had referred to the latter contribution as recombination .",
    "so far , five independent groups @xcite have presented such a complete @xmath52 calculation .",
    "et al_. @xcite and slabospitsky @xcite agreed that the fragmentation contribution dominates at the large transverse momentum region .",

    "_ @xcite claimed that fragmentation never dominates for all kinematical region of @xmath21 and the recombination diagrams can never be ignored .",
    "independently , masetti and sartogo @xcite have recently obtained results claimed to be consistent with berezhnoy _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "there are certainly discrepancies among these calculations .",
    "most recently , kolodziej _ et al _ @xcite performed yet another independent calculations using two different methods  the usual trace and the modern helicity amplitude techniques .",
    "both methods agreed with each other numerically to very high accuracy , according to the authors .",
    "_ @xcite also did a very thorough comparison with previous exact calculations by comparing numerically their matrix elements with other groups @xcite , but could not find agreement using identical input parameters .",

    "_ @xcite did a comparison of the production of @xmath3 mesons between the exact calculation and the fragmentation approximation , and found that the fragmentation approach is indeed valid for @xmath166 gev ! because of the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , we believe that the fragmentation contribution should begin to dominate the production of @xmath0 mesons at @xmath167 gev . also , we would like to emphasize that the detector coverage and performance do require a minimum transverse momentum cut and a rapidity cut on the @xmath3 meson .",
    "thus , the non - fragmentation ( recombination ) contribution , which is substantial at low @xmath21 , becomes less important as the lowest @xmath21 range is being excluded .",
    "the main result of this paper is the inclusive cross section of the ground state @xmath3 at the tevatron .",
    "we have included in this work all the contributions from the direct @xmath49 fragmentation and induced gluon fragmentation , as well as the cascade contributions from all the excited s - wave and p - wave states below the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "previous result presented by one of us in ref.@xcite only included the direct @xmath49 fragmentation into s - wave states , since the p - wave fragmentation functions were not available at that time .",
    "later it was pointed out in ref.@xcite that the induced gluon fragmentation contribution is nonnegligible .",
    "the induced gluon fragmentation contribution is about 20  30% ( 30  40% ) of the direct @xmath49 fragmentation contribution at the tevatron ( lhc ) energies .",
    "the two sets of p - wave states included in this work contribute at the level of 30% .",
    "furthermore , we have employed here a more updated set of parton distribution functions than those used in refs.@xcite . as a result , the cross sections increase roughly by 25% , mainly due to the increase in the gluon luminosities . when all these aforementioned differences are taken into account",
    ", the net result is about 70  80% ( a factor of two ) larger than the previous result presented in ref.@xcite at the tevatron ( lhc ) .    to recap , in this paper we have performed calculations of the transverse momentum spectra and integrated cross sections for the s- and p - wave @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we have also predicted the inclusive production rate for the @xmath3 meson , and found that there should be enough signature events to confirm the existence of @xmath3 at the tevatron , whereas the lhc will be a copious source of @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that what we have calculated in this paper represents only the contribution from fragmentation , while there should also be other non - fragmentation contributions , especially at the low @xmath21 region ( @xmath168 gev ) .",
    "at least , our results represent a lower bound of the production rate for @xmath3 . in the near future",
    ", the production of @xmath3 at the tevatron would provide another interesting test for perturbative qcd , and we expect a very exciting experimental program of @xmath3 at the lhc .",
