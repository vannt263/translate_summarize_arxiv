    "piston configurations have received considerable interest because they allow for an unambiguous prediction of casimir forces @xcite .",
    "the force depends on the boundary conditions imposed , the cross section of the piston and on properties of additional kaluza - klein dimensions that might be present@xcite . in this contribution",

    "to interpolate between dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , we consider fractional neumann conditions @xmath9,\\ ] ] on the plates .",
    "it can be shown that the casimir force only depends on the difference @xmath10 . therefore without loss of generality , we fix dirichlet boundary conditions on the left plate and impose fractional neumann conditions of order @xmath11 on the right plate . for concreteness , on the walls of the cylinder dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed .    using the piston approach@xcite",
    ", we first consider the casimir force acting on a piston moving freely inside a closed cylinder @xmath12\\times \\omega \\times \\mathcal{n}$ ] , and let the right end of the cylinder go to infinity , i.e. , @xmath13 .",

    "we shall assume @xmath28 ; for @xmath32 and @xmath33 the casimir force will have to be divided by two .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if one considers a cylinder of length @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 and if one imposes twisted boundary conditions @xmath36 for a complex massive scalar field @xmath1 , one obtains the same set of eigenfrequencies .    using the zeta regularization method to compute the casimir energy , we find that @xmath37where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are terms that are independent of @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath40 does not contribute to the casimir force acting on the piston , and we find by taking the limit @xmath13 in that the casimir force acting between two parallel plates is @xmath41this expression shows that in the high temperature limit , the leading term of the casimir force is linear in @xmath42 given by the sum of the terms with @xmath43 , which is usually called the classical term .",
    "for the low temperature behavior , some computations give ( we use the notation @xmath44 ) @xmath45 the first two terms are the zero temperature casimir force .",
    "the sum of the last two terms is the thermal correction .",
    "it goes to zero exponentially fast when @xmath46 .    for a pair of dirichlet - dirichlet plates , i.e.",
    ", @xmath30 , ( divided by two ) shows that the casimir force is always attractive ( negative ) . for dirichlet - neumann plates , i.e. , @xmath47 , ( divided by two )",
    "shows that the casimir force is always repulsive .",
    "in fact , this is true for all @xmath48 since the function @xmath49is positive for @xmath48 and @xmath50 . in all these cases",
    "the force is enhanced by the presence of extra dimensions . for @xmath51",
    ", one can show that when the plate separation is large enough , the casimir force eventually becomes attractive .",
    "when the plate separation @xmath35 is much smaller than the size @xmath52 of the cross section , some computations show that the leading term of the casimir force density acting on the plates is @xmath53where @xmath54 . in the massless case",
    "( @xmath55 ) , the sum of the terms with @xmath56 should be replaced by @xmath57 a form of more suitable to study the low temperature behavior is @xmath58 when @xmath55 , the sum of the terms with @xmath59 in should be replaced by    @xmath60one can show that when @xmath61 , the massive correction to the casimir force is of order @xmath62",
    ". therefore , and show that when @xmath61 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the size of the internal manifold , the nature of the casimir force is determined by the sign of @xmath65with @xmath66 if @xmath67 and @xmath68 if @xmath69 . for any @xmath70 ,",

    "one can show that @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , we find that when @xmath75 , for @xmath76 , the casimir force can change from attractive to repulsive when one increases the temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "when the plate separation @xmath35 becomes much smaller than the size of the internal manifold , then the internal manifold should be treated in the same way as the large cross section . in this case , we find that the sign of the casimir force is determined by @xmath77 with @xmath78 if @xmath67 and with @xmath79 if @xmath69 .",
    "again , we see that decreasing the distance between the plates such that it is much smaller than the size of the internal manifold can change the casimir force from repulsive to attractive for some values of @xmath11 .    9 r.m .",
