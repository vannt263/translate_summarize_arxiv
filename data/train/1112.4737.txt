    "the study of cellular processes at the single - molecule level is a flourishing field of research in biology .",
    "individual molecules labeled with sub - micron markers can now be tracked in a cellular environment , and quantitative information about their dynamics can be obtained by reconstructing their trajectory .",
    "one of the most used techniques for this purpose is single - molecule fluorescence microscopy ( smfm ) , which relies on a labeling with nanometer - sized fluorescent markers such as organic dyes or quantum dots .",
    "but standard smfm provides no information on the axial position of the marker , limiting this technique to 2d tracking .",
    "recent improvements of smfm such as astigmatism optic@xcite , @xmath1pi microscopy @xcite , double - helix psf @xcite , or multi - planes detection @xcite have made possible 3d tracking . since the depth of field of these techniques is limited to a few microns , 3d tracking of molecules that explore larger distances in the thickness of a sample requires to continuously adjust the position of the focal plane of the microscope objective , which strongly limits the time resolution .",
    "digital holographic microscopy ( dhm ) @xcite circumvents this drawback . in dhm ,",
    "a ccd camera records the interference pattern between the light scattered by the sample and a reference wave , and a single shot is sufficient to determine the 3d positions of scatterers embedded in a non - diffusing environment , over a depth of typically a hundred of microns .    as the scattering cross section of a particle scales as the sixth power of its radius @xcite ,",
    "how easily and accurately a particle can be detected strongly depends on its size .",
    "several publications demonstrate the tracking of micron - sized colloids by using in - line holography @xcite , with a localization accuracy in the nanometer range through the use of high numerical aperture ( na ) microscope objectives .",
    "for example , with a @xmath2 na 1.4 oil immersion objective , cheong et al .",
    "@xcite reported lateral and axial localization accuracies of 4 and 20 nm respectively .",
    "this result was obtained with polystyrene spheres of diameter @xmath3 m , whose scattering cross section is quite large .",
    "the tracking of @xmath4 nm particles , whose scattering cross section is extremely low , is much more difficult , and , as far as we know , has not been demonstrated using in - line holography .",
    "yet the detection of such small particles is possible using dhm in a off - axis geometry @xcite with a noise level as low as possible @xcite and using good light scatterers , such as gold nanobeads @xcite . by this way , @xmath5 to @xmath6 nm gold particles embedded in an agarose gel",
    "have been detected and localized @xcite . since gold particles",
    "are not toxic for cells , they can be used as markers in biology @xcite , and d = 40 nm gold nanobeads fixed on the membrane receptors of a living cell have been localized @xcite .",
    "more recently , 3d tracking of batio3 particles with second harmonic generation dhm was also demonstrated @xcite .    here , the main advantage of dhm , with respect to in - line holography , is the possibility to independently adjust the intensity of the illumination and reference beams in order to get the best detection sensitivity , by adjusting the reference beam intensity @xcite , and the largest signal , by adjusting the illumination beam intensity .",
    "combining dhm with dark field illumination allows then to detect nanometer - sized particles , as the sample can be illuminated with an intensity as large as possible , while avoiding a saturation of the camera @xcite .",
    "for example , atlan et al . and warnasooriya et al .",
    "uses total internal reflection ( tir ) to detect and localize @xmath5 nm and @xmath7 nm particles @xcite . but",
    "the tir configuration used in these experiments yield a standing wave which does not allow to track moving particles : when a moving particle crosses a node , the illumination ( and thus the signal ) goes down to zero , and the particle is lost .",
    "dubois et al . uses another dark field illumination configuration that focuses the illumination on a mask @xcite .",
    "since the illumination is parallel to the optical axis , no standing wave can appear , but since the illumination passes through the microscope objective , one expects parasitic reflections of the illumination beam .    in this paper , we present a digital holographic microscopy technique which makes possible to track @xmath8 nm gold particles 3d diffusing in water .",
    "the illumination is parallel to the optical axis to prevent the formation of standing waves , and the holographic signal is collected by a na=0.5 dark field reflecting microscope objective . with such objective ,",
    "the illumination beam is masked before the microscope objective and parasitic reflections are avoided .",
    "this yields high dynamic dark field illumination , which makes possible to detect , localize and track @xmath8 nm particles .",
    "first we describe the setup , which combines dark - field microscopy and off - axis holography .",
    "then we present the algorithm of reconstruction , our procedure to localize the beads , and describe how we can reach a real - time localization by performing calculations on a graphic card .",
    "finally we show that our setup allows us to track gold nanoparticles in motion with a lateral ( @xmath9 ) resolution of @xmath10 nm and an axial ( @xmath11 ) resolution of @xmath12 . since na=0.5 , the resolution ( especially in @xmath11 ) is lower than with na=1.4 in - line holography @xcite .",
    "we also show that the depth of field of our holographic microscope is made two orders of magnitude larger than in optical microscopy .",
    "our dhm experimental setup , depicted in fig . [ fig : setup ] , is designed to investigate the brownian motion of @xmath13 diameter gold particles diffusing in a @xmath14 ( length @xmath15 width @xmath15 height ) cell chamber ( ibidi @xmath16 ) filled with water .",
    "the concentration of nanoparticles is adjusted to @xmath17 particles / mm@xmath18 to have a few particles per field of view .",
    "the light source is a @xmath19 diode pump solid state laser ( crystal laser ) with a short coherence length ( @xmath20 ) to avoid parasitic interferences raising from reflexions between the optical elements .",
    "the laser beam is split into two beams by a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) , a half - wave plate before the pbs setting the ratio of energy between the emerging beams .",
    "the reference beam passes through a dove prism fixed on a micrometer translation stage to adjust the length of the optical path .",
    "this beam is spatially filtered through a @xmath21 m diameter pinhole and then expanded as to uniformly cover the ccd chip of the camera ( 512 @xmath15 512 pixels , andor luca r ) .",
    "the illumination beam is focalized on the sample with a plano - convex lens of focal length @xmath22 cm ( waist diameter @xmath23 , laser intensity @xmath24 w/@xmath25 ) .",
    "the light scattered by the beads is collected in transmission with a dark - field reflecting objective ( edmund optics , reflx series ) of @xmath26 and @xmath27 magnification .",
    "a small mask on the input of the objective limits the collection of light between @xmath28 and @xmath26 , so the illumination beam is totally blocked after passing through the sample .",
    "this dark - field configuration prevents the saturation of the ccd chip .",
    "a non - polarizing @xmath29 beam splitter behind the objective combines the scattered light with the reference beam .",
    "the ccd camera records the interference pattern on @xmath30 frames with a @xmath31 rate .",
    "the last beam - splitter is tilted by few degrees to be in off - axis configuration .",
    "in digital holography , the ccd sensor records an intensity @xmath32 which is the interference of the reference beam with the light scattered by the nano - objects .",
    "@xmath32 is thus a sum of 4 terms :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the intensity of the reference beam , @xmath35 the intensity of the scattered light and @xmath36 are the electric fields for the reference beam and the scattered light respectively .",
    "as the scattering cross section of a @xmath0 diameter gold particle calculated with the rayleigh - mie scattering model is about @xmath37 at @xmath19 @xcite , the integration over the collection solid angle of the objective ( @xmath38 ) gives @xmath39 for a single particle .",
    "thus @xmath35 can be neglected compared to the other terms of eq.([eq : intensity ] ) .",
    "the field @xmath40 , the amplitude of which is about @xmath41 , contains the phase of the scattered light necessary to a 3d localization of the particle . in the fourier space , the tilted beam splitter adds a spatial frequency on the two conjugates terms of interference , and thus the different terms of @xmath32 are spatially separated , i.e. @xmath34 remains centered on the zero frequency of the fourier plane while the two cross terms of interference are centered on the spatial frequency induced by the off - axis geometry .",
    "since 3d reconstruction is a time consuming task even using recent multi - cores processors , we developed parallel calculations on a graphic card ( nvidia geforce gt470 , 448 cores ) @xcite .",
    "our ` c++ ` based algorithm uses the nvidia cuda library to decompose the calculations on the gpus of the card . among the existing methods to reconstruct holograms ,",
    "the most common is the convolution method described by schnars et al . @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of this method is that the pixel size of the reconstructed image depends on the distance of reconstruction , so that the image of a thick sample is distorted .",
    "therefore this method is not convenient for 3d tracking , as the lateral scale depends on the depth of reconstruction considered .",
    "here we chose to reconstruct the holograms with the angular spectrum method @xcite , which , by compensating the sphericity of the signal wave , allows to reconstruct the hologram without distortion .",
    "our algorithm can be decomposed in 6 steps :    i. _ subtraction of the background : _ : :    in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , we subtract from the    last recorded frame the average of the ten previous frames .",
    "phase    shifting holography @xcite is also an effective technique for    reducing noise , but the minimal delay @xmath42 ms    between two frames , which is driven by our camera , is too long to use    this technique for nanoparticle tracking .",
    "this step of calculation is    performed only for particles in motion ( i.e. we skipped this step for    the results presented in [ fixed ] ) .",
    "numerical correction of the signal wave sphericity : _ : :    the hologram @xmath32 is multiplied by a complex phase    matrix @xmath43 to compensate the sphericity induced by the    microscope objective on the signal wave :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the local radius of curvature of the wave on    the ccd plane .",
    "if the reference wave is a plane wave , this distance    @xmath45 is also the distance between the ccd chip and the back    focal plane of the objective .",

    "[ fig : recons](a ) ,    the zero - order appears as a square because of the multiplication by    the matrix @xmath43 .",
    "the term related to    @xmath40 is in the down - right corner , centered on the    spatial frequency induced by the off - axis geometry .",
    "the term related    to @xmath48 is centered on the conjugate frequency    ( top - left corner ) . at this step ,",
    "the calculation is equivalent of the    reconstruction in one fft ( convolution method ) of the hologram at the    distance @xmath45 described in the previous step . since the    back focal plane of our microscope objective coincides with the output    pupil plane , which is common for high magnification objective , we see    on the down - right corner a sharp reconstruction of the output pupil    plane .",
    "if we change in step ( i ) the parameter @xmath45 to    @xmath49 , the image of the output pupil would be sharp in the    top - left corner , while the term related to @xmath40    would be blurred .",
    "[ fig : recons](b ) shows @xmath47 in the _ k - space _    when the background is removed ( step ( i ) performed ) .",
    "the zero - order    term in the middle of the _ k - space _ is largely removed compare to fig .    [",

    "since the shape of the pupil is sharp in the k - space , we    can isolate precisely the pixels containing the signal , minimizing the    loss of information . to more",
    "precisely calibrate the radius and the    center of the filter , we used a diffusive paper as a sample before    performing experiments .",

    "this accuracy strongly increases for @xmath75 , and for @xmath76 , the localization of the particle is not possible because the scattered signal level reaches the noise level .",
    "the local maximum at @xmath73 observed on the axial accuracy curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reso](b ) ) shows that the localization is not optimal when the gold particle is the focal plane of the objective . in this case",
    "the particle is imaged on a small area of the ccd chip , so that the interference pattern spreads on a small number of pixels , which degrades the quality of the reconstruction @xcite .    in the case of particle tracking ,",
    "the position of the focal plane in the sample has to be fixed . to minimize the spherical aberrations due to the presence of the coverslip ,",
    "the focal plane should coincide with the sample - coverslip interface . in this configuration ,",

    "[ fig : reso](a ) and [ fig : reso](b ) . yet",
    "tracking particles remains possible when the focal plane is set above the sample - coverslip interface as demonstrated below , as the cost of a slightly worse axial localization accuracy .",

    "[ fig : motion ] , our method allows us to simultaneously track several particles .",
    "a volume of @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , i.e. @xmath94 pixels , can be reconstructed from a single hologram , and the localization method described in the section _ [ method ] _ can be performed to localize several beads with a sub - pixel accuracy . by repeating the algorithm for successive frames , we could for instance reconstruct the trajectories of 3 gold particles diffusing in water ( fig .",
    "[ fig : motion ] ) .",
    "we were able to track particles during up to 10 s ( @xmath95 frames ) .",
    "since the time needed to reconstruct a volume of @xmath94 pixels is about 0.5 s ( i.e. much larger than @xmath96 ms ) , reconstruction is necessarily a post - processing process in this case .",
