    "at the basis of applications of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which governs the interactions of quarks and gluons , is the property of factorization of corresponding amplitudes in hard processes . proving the property of factorization means that a hadronic process at large momentum transfer can be dissected in a product of distinct quantities each associated with separate regimes of dynamics .",
    "then , subprocesses developing at short distances and involving partons  quarks and gluons  can be accurately described in a systematic way within perturbation theory . on the other hand , the dynamical ( mainly nonperturbative ) features of the hadron binding effects",
    "are encoded in correlators , which contain quark and gluon field operators , and can be parameterized in terms of light - cone wave functions and parton distribution functions .",
    "these quantities are process - independent and describe the universal interpolation between hadrons and their quark and gluon degrees of freedom as distributions over the fractions of the longitudinal and intrinsic transverse momenta carried by the partons .",
    "they have to be determined by nonperturbative methods ( models ) , lattice calculations , or from the data .",
    "the ( spacelike ) transition form factors ( tffs ) of pseudoscalar mesons , in particular the pion , have been extensively studied within qcd , because in leading order they are purely electromagnetic processes with the binding qcd effects being factorized out into the pion distribution amplitude ( da)see @xcite for a review and @xcite for recent references .",
    "this means that for a highly virtual photon with the four - momentum transfer @xmath2 and a quasi - real photon with @xmath3 , the tff can be cast as the convolution of the twist - two hard - scattering amplitude @xmath4 , describing the elementary process @xmath5 , with the twist - two pion da @xmath6 so that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the scale of the twist - four term taking values in the range @xmath9  gev@xmath10 .",
    "note that we have omitted for simplicity variables irrelevant for our discussion ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details ) .",
    "several experimental groups have measured @xmath11 and @xmath12 in two - photon processes @xmath13 , where @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the range of probed photon momentum varies from @xmath17  gev@xmath10 ( cello ) , to @xmath18  gev@xmath10 ( cleo ) , to @xmath19  gev@xmath10 ( babar ) . a recent compilation and discussion of the experimental data with the focus on the babar data",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "the current situation from the experimental point of view can be summarized like this : all data for the tffs pertaining to the non - strange part of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 conform with the asymptotic qcd limit @xcite @xmath20 and are best described by endpoint - suppressed das , while there is remarkable contrast to the high-@xmath2 tail of the babar data for the @xmath1 tff @xcite .",
    "the rising trend of the babar data can be reproduced by the fit @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22  gev and @xmath23 .",
    "the latter value differs significantly from 0 predicted by qcd perturbation theory , cf .",
    "eq.([eq : convolution ] ) .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "the conclusions drawn from different approaches are at odds with each other and can not accommodate all available data simultaneously to resolve the puzzle . in our recent data analysis in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we used light - cone sum rules ( lcsrs ) @xcite and performed an extended calculation of the pion tff which takes into account the next - to - leading ( nlo ) order radiative corrections @xcite and the twist - four contribution @xcite , while also including in terms of uncertainties the main next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) correction @xcite and the twist - six term , computed in @xcite .",
    "the evolution of @xmath6 with @xmath24  gev@xmath10 was also taken into account at the nlo level with @xmath25  mev and @xmath26  mev .",
    "the main observations are listed below .",
    "\\(i ) all data for @xmath27 in the range @xmath28 $ ]  gev@xmath10 can be described at the level of @xmath29 with only two gegenbauer coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 with negative @xmath31 , satisfying @xmath32 .",
    "\\(ii ) the error ellipses of the data ( cello , cleo , babar ) in the @xmath33 plane overlap with the allowed region for these two parameters determined before @xcite using qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates @xcite .",
    "these pion das are characterized by a strong suppression of their kinematical endpoints @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the quark inside the pion .",
    "\\(iii ) beyond 10  gev@xmath10 , an acceptable statistical description of the data ( @xmath36 ) demands the inclusion of a sizeable and positive gegenbauer coefficient @xmath37 with @xmath38 ( at the scale @xmath39  gev @xcite ) .",
    "still higher coefficients have been taken into account in @xcite but found to have little effect .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to select the optimal number of harmonics needed .",
    "thus , the endpoint enhancement provided this way is not sufficient to reproduce the steep rise of the pion tff observed by babar @xcite .",
    "the range of variation of the associated pion das , conforming with this 3d ( @xmath40 ) analysis , was worked out for both sets of data , i.e. , @xmath28 $ ]  gev@xmath10  set  1 and @xmath41 $ ]  gev@xmath10  set  2 , in @xcite , see also fig .",
    "[ fig.pionff3-d ] .",
    "this figure shows best - fit results for both data sets in the form of bands of tffs with errors stemming from the sum of the statistical errors and the twist - four uncertainties .",
    "the best - fit curve to set  1 in fig .  [ fig.pionff3-d ] is represented by the solid ( blue ) line , whereas the best - fit curve to set  2 at high @xmath2 is denoted by the dashed ( red ) line .",
    "this behavior makes it apparent that in the framework of lcsrs the fit to the babar data above 9  gev@xmath10 deviates from that at low-@xmath2 at the level of 1@xmath42 .",

    "these estimates were derived from our lcsr analysis @xcite by combining all data of set  1 with the lattice results obtained in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "all values were evaluated at the typical lattice scale @xmath47  gev@xmath10 , using the definition @xmath48 , with @xmath49 being normalized to unity .",
    "the `` window '' for @xmath50 , obtained for the data with @xmath51 gev@xmath10 ( set  1 ) , has in terms of the @xmath52 error ellipse a large intersection with the most recent lattice estimates from @xcite . including into the fit the high-@xmath2 babar data",
    ", this intersection significantly deteriorates  see @xcite for further details .",
    "\\(iv ) these findings indicate a significant discrepancy between the babar data for @xmath1 and the method of lcsrs  and in more general terms the qcd factorization  at high-@xmath2 values , an indication that the analysis in @xcite is possibly no turning point in understanding the high-@xmath2 @xmath1 babar data within qcd .",
    "thus , our analysis does not confirm the opposite conclusions drawn in @xcite which uses the same calculational scheme , but a larger value of the auxiliary borel parameter @xmath53 , notably 1.5  gev@xmath10 , instead of values @xmath54",
    "gev@xmath10 as in our approach , ( which follows @xcite ) and more coefficients in the conformal expansion of the pion da .",
    "\\(v ) conformity with the increasing trend of the babar data can be actually achieved only with a flatlike pion da , like that proposed in @xcite and in a different context in @xcite .",
    "however , the use of such a pion da reduces the accuracy of the predicted tff at lower values of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was emphasized in @xcite that then one becomes unable to reproduce the babar data @xcite for the nonstrange part of the @xmath15 : @xmath55 . and the @xmath16 is model dependent .",
    "moreover , the decay parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 are not well known and strongly depend on the mixing between the two eta mesons .",
    "we here employed the mixing scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite . ] indeed , employing the mixing scheme of @xcite , one can relate the tff of @xmath58 to that of the @xmath1 multiplied by a factor @xmath59 due to the quark charges ( also assuming that @xmath60 ) .",
    "hence , it appears that the tff for the @xmath1 and the @xmath58 follow antithetic trends that correspond to das with distinct endpoint characteristics : extreme endpoint enhancement for the first vs. endpoint suppression for the second @xcite . because the properties of @xmath58 are not so sensitive to the choice of the mixing angle , such a strong antithetic behavior can not be ascribed to this uncertainty .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",

    "our predictions @xcite are represented by a ( green ) strip whose width is a measure of the involved theoretical uncertainties , while the solid ( blue ) lines reproduce and extend farther out the predictions of @xcite .",

    "the crucial question is : what kind of mechanism underlies such a strong flavor - symmetry breaking in the pseudoscalar meson sector of qcd ?",

    "the experimental data are taken from various experiments , referenced in the text .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in the next section , we will discuss some proposed explanations of the babar data without attempting to be comprehensive or conclusive .",
    "let us start by recalling some facts related to the pion tff .",
    "the cleo data favor a pion da close to the asymptotic ( as ) form @xcite excluding pion das of the chernyak ",
    "zhitnitsky ( cz ) @xcite type .",
    "later , more detailed analyses of these data @xcite have excluded @xmath61 and @xmath62 at the @xmath63 and the @xmath64 level , respectively . to achieve an agreement with the cleo data with @xmath52 accuracy",
    ", one has to use endpoint - suppressed pion das of the form derived in @xcite with the help of qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates . in view of these findings , it was thought that more precise measurements which would extend the range of @xmath2 to much higher values , would confirm this trend because for large momentum transfers the application of perturbative qcd on the basis of collinear factorization should work better and better .",
    "surprisingly , the rapid growth of the high-@xmath2 babar data is at odds with these expectations , though this was not immediately recognized .",
    "but in coincidence with the publication of the babar data in the arxiv , two of us have clearly stated that no agreement between the standard qcd scheme and a rising tff ( scaled by @xmath2 ) can be achieved in terms of endpoint - vanishing @xmath65 das @xcite .",
    "interestingly , other authors proposed at the same time explanations of such an `` anomalous '' behavior by appealing to flatlike pion das @xcite , outside the standard qcd context .",
    "such approaches suffer from the point of view that they depend in a sensitive way on specific , i.e. , _ contextual _ nonperturbative scales that can not be linked to the standard qcd scales .",
    "therefore , the meaning of these scales , with their particular values needed to explain the babar data , remains obscure . consequently",
    ", though the babar data can be explained within such schemes , because they provide logarithmic enhancement to the tff , it is not possible to identify a _",
    "single _ underlying physical mechanism which yields enhancement of the pion tff .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to understand why the pion and the @xmath15 should behave like `` pointlike '' particles ( see , for instance , @xcite ) as implied by flatlike ( or flat - top ) das , while the das of the @xmath16 and the @xmath66 should be close to their asymptotic forms ( eventually with additional endpoint suppression ) . approaches the qcd prediction from below ",
    "see @xcite for a discussion . ]",
    "the assertion in @xcite that this is due to the larger mass of these particles is not very convincing , given that the das of the @xmath1 and the @xmath15 are very similar in shape in the nonlocal chiral quark model of @xcite , though the corresponding masses @xmath67  mev and @xmath68  mev are very different .",
    "nevertheless , it would be premature to dismiss the correctness and/or relevance of such explanations .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath1 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 tffs has been carried out within holographic approaches of ads / qcd , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig.pionff.fit ] the two broken ( blue ) lines represent the independent findings of two such approaches for @xmath27 .",
    "the dotted line denotes the prediction derived in @xcite , using a dressed electromagnetic current and taking into account the twist - two and the twist - four hadronic ads components of the pion wave function ( eq .  ( 43 ) in @xcite ) within a soft - wall holographic approach . the combination of the nonperturbative bound - state dynamics , predicted by the holographic ads / qcd correspondence , with the perturbative efremov  radyushkin",
    " brodsky ",
    "lepage evolution  @xcite was treated in detail in @xcite .",
    "the double - dotted - dashed line shows an analogous result @xcite , obtained by an extension of the hard - wall ads / qcd model which includes the chern ",
    "simons term , required to reproduce the chiral anomaly of qcd .",
    "note that the shown curve beyond 10  gev@xmath10 was generated by us .",
    "it is obvious that both displayed predictions are incongruent with the babar data for @xmath1 , while they agree with each other and with the babar data for the @xmath0 , though they somewhat overestimate all data at lower values of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , one observes that both predictions overlap with the band of the results derived in @xcite and indicate conformity with endpoint - vanishing ( or even endpoint - suppressed ) pion das , like in the bms formalism @xcite .",
    "the chiral anomaly plays an important role also in another approach , proposed in @xcite , which combines an exact nonperturbative sum rule , following from the dispersive representation of the axial anomaly , and quark - hadron duality . within this approach",
    "it is claimed @xcite that the increase of the babar data for the @xmath1 is due to small corrections to the continuum ( i.e. , an infinite number of higher resonances ) which entail a strong enhancement of the pion tff , whereas the same effect for the @xmath15 turns out to be several times smaller .",
    "depending on the particular mixing scheme adopted , the obtained predictions @xcite for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons agree with the gross of the babar data for the associated tffs .",
    "the usefulness of the dispersive approach @xcite which does not rely upon factorization  has to be further tested by extending it to the singlet channel .",
    "another approach that relates the babar effect to the chiral anomaly is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the light pseudoscalar meson - photon tffs for the pion and the @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons were also discussed in @xcite , using a quark - flavor mixing scheme with only one mixing angle @xcite .",
    "the associated das of these mesons are obtained from a light - cone wave function @xcite by tuning a master parameter to appropriate values , whereas the constituent quark masses and the mixing angle play a relatively minor role .",
    "the main message from this analysis is that the ( logarithmic ) growth of the scaled tff @xmath27 , indicated by the babar data , can not be reproduced , while it remains unexplained why @xmath27 and @xmath69 should behave so differently .",
    "in fact , within the range of the model parameters , the babar data on @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be explained simultaneously in the whole @xmath2 region .",
    "so far , no single mechanism with a physical interpretation within the standard qcd framework has been identified to explain the increase of the pion tff as a result of particular quark - gluon interactions .",
    "effects associated with the transverse - momentum degrees of freedom , intrinsic , i.e. , inside the pion wave function , and resummed in terms of sudakov factors , have also been discussed with respect to the babar data , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "some other examples of studies of the babar data in conjunction with particular nonperturbative qcd models can be found in @xcite .",
    "the steep rise of the pion - photon tff , observed by the babar collaboration , indicates the existence of an enhancement mechanism that can not be explained within the standard qcd scheme based on collinear factorization .",
    "this scheme predicts that at large values of the momentum transfer the pion does not rebound as a _ unit _ but reveals its partonic structure in such a way that the scaled tff approaches a constant .",
    "several theoretical approaches within qcd , like lcsrs @xcite , schwinger  dyson equations @xcite , etc .",
    ", are in conflict with the dichotomous behavior of the babar data for the tffs of the pseudoscalar @xmath71 , and @xmath16 mesons .",
    "should the anomalous behavior of the @xmath1 babar data be confirmed by independent measurements , e.g. , by the belle experiment , then the babar effect will amount to crossing the rubicon and the enigma will become a real challenge for qcd based on collinear factorization .",
    "moreover , one would not be able to take recourse for an explanation to holographic models based on the ads / qcd correspondence @xcite , because these are incompatible with the @xmath1 babar data at high @xmath2 .",
