    "the organization and phase transitions of langmuir films , i.e. insoluble amphiphilic monolayers at the air / water interface are strongly affected by the dimension 2 @xcite .",
    "considerable effort has been directed during the last few years towards the determination of the structure of the different phases of those systems by grazing incidence x - ray diffraction ( gid)@xcite . on the theoretical side , many aspects of the phase transitions can be understood using a recently developed landau theory @xcite , and realistic simulations are now available @xcite .",
    "+ beyond the great achievement that was the determination of the two - dimensional structure of langmuir films , a next step , to which simulations contribute , is the understanding of the role of intermolecular forces and conformational defects .",
    "obviously , the elastic properties of monolayers crucially depend on both potentials and defects and their understanding in terms of basic interactions and chain conformations is a challenging goal . up to now , only the two - dimensional compression and shear elastic moduli have been the subject of detailed studies . for example , the shear modulus has been determined by directly applying the shear to a large polycrystalline sample @xcite , bending a monocrystal @xcite , or analysing the shape of bragg singularities @xcite .",
    "because of their inhomogeneity , the elastic moduli obtained with large polycrystalline samples are much smaller than those obtained with monocrystals .",
    "this is also true for the compression modulus .",
    "this was recognized by bommarito et al .",
    "@xcite who determined the compression modulus in different phases of behenic acid by measuring the surface pressure using a wilhelmy balance and the molecular area from gid data .",
    "another problem shared by all these studies ( with a notable exception @xcite ) is that the anisotropy of the monolayer is not considered , preventing a precise understanding in terms of microscopic structure .",
    "+ in this study , we extend the method of ref.@xcite to determine the linear compressibilities of two different fatty acids , while addressing the anisotropy of the monolayer .",
    "this is possible because the gid measurements allow the determination of the two - dimensional lattice parameters , the monolayer thickness and the molecular tilt .",
    "the surface ( volume ) compressibility @xmath7 of a 2d ( 3d ) crystal is defined as the relative diminution of its area ( volume ) @xmath8 when submitted to a pressure @xmath9 : @xmath10 . a linear compressibility can also be defined along each direction @xmath11 as : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a length along the direction @xmath11 . in a non - isotropic medium ,",
    "the linear compressibility depends on the direction , and can give hints about microscopic phenomena .",
    "this has been successfully applied to polymer crystals @xcite , where information about molecular interactions was obtained by comparing measurements and calculations of the young modulus and of the linear compressibility along the different crystal axes .",
    "+ the compressibility can be expressed as a function of the coefficients of the rank 4 elastic tensor @xmath14 relating the strain tensor @xmath15 , describing the relative distortion of the crystal , and the stress tensor @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath17 ( summation over repeated indices is assumed ) .",
    "the volume compressibility is @xmath18 if @xmath9 is the applied isotropic pressure .",
    "the linear compressibility in the direction of the unit vector @xmath19 is : @xmath20 .",
    "the pressure @xmath9 applied to our systems is on average@xcite a 2d lateral isotropic pressure , so that , if we take @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the plane of the sample , the stress tensor becomes : @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is kronecker s symbol ) .",
    "hence @xmath25 , and @xmath26    owing to its symmetry properties , the rank 4 elastic tensor @xmath14 can be represented by a @xmath27 symmetrical matrix @xmath28 with the following correspondance rules : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "+ the crystals under consideration here can alternately be viewed as very thin three - dimensional crystals if their properties along the vertical direction are considered or as two - dimensional crystals if we are only interested in their in - plane properties . of course , the 3d description is more complete and rich .",
    "+ all the studied mesophases are either monoclinic ( @xmath38 ) or orthorombic ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) ( cf fig.[orthomono ] ) .",
    "whereas the monoclinic elastic matrix has 13 independent coefficients , the orthorombic elastic matrix has only 9 independent coefficients .",
    "if the axes are chosen as indicated in fig.1.b , the resulting form of the linear compressibility for these phases is : @xmath39 for orthorombic ( untilted ) phases the last term vanishes .",
    "this formula allows one to predict the value of the linear compressibility in a particular plane .",
    "if the plane of the sample is considered , then @xmath19 can be defined by the azimuth angle @xmath40 ( cf .",
    "fig.1.a ) , @xmath41 , and :",
    "@xmath42    for monoclinic phases , where the molecules are tilted from the vertical by an angle @xmath43 , another interesting plane to consider is the one perpendicular to the molecular axis ( that we will call the transverse plane ) . in that plane",
    "we have @xmath44 ( the azimuth @xmath40 is indicated fig.1.b ) , and :    @xmath45/\\cos^2\\theta \\times \\cos^2\\phi \\nonumber \\\\ & + & ( s_{12}+s_{22})\\sin^2\\phi \\label{tr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this shows that if one is able to measure two linear compressibilities in the plane of the sample , this is sufficient to yield all the linear compressibilities in that plane , and to determine the coefficients @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "if the molecular tilt @xmath43 can be measured independently , two linear compressibilities in the transverse plane can be evaluated , hence all the linear compressibilities in that plane .",
    "one has therefore access to the coefficient @xmath48 /\\cos^2\\theta$ ] .",
    "if one is able to evaluate this coefficient in a large enough tilt angle range , then @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be obtained .",
    "the two diffraction peaks generally found in gid experiments for orthorombic or monoclinic phases allow one to measure two such linear compressibilities in the plane of the sample , and the tilt angle can be determined from the bragg - rod profiles .",
    "it is then , in principle , possible to have access to all these combinations of coefficients .",
    "the grazing incidence diffraction ( gid ) experiments were carried out at the d41b beamline of the lure - dci storage ring in orsay , france .",
    "the @xmath51 radiation was selected using a @xmath52 monochromator .",
    "the grazing angle of incidence @xmath53 was fixed slightly below the critical angle for total external reflection using a mirror .",
    "the width and height of the incident beam were fixed by slits .",
    "the diffracted radiation with in - plane wave - vector transfer @xmath54 was selected using a soller collimator ( opening @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 at @xmath57 ) , and detected in a vertically mounted argon - filled position sensitive detector ( psd)@xcite .",
    "the langmuir trough mounted on the diffractometer was equipped with a movable single barrier , allowing the compression of the film .",
    "the surface pressure @xmath9 was measured using a whilhelmy balance .",
    "the vessel containing the trough was sealed , pumped and filled with a flow of water saturated helium .",
    "the temperature was regulated to within @xmath58 using the water of a large thermal bath .",
    "the amphiphilic molecules used where fatty acids @xmath59 , purchased from fluka ( @xmath60 purity ) , and used as obtained .",
    "two different chain lengths were investigated : behenic acid @xmath61 ( we shall sometimes use @xmath62 for it in the following ) , and myristic acid @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) in order to get a first insight into the role of chain length ( for a simple homogeneous solid plate the compressibility is expected to be proportional to the thickness ) . behenic acid was dissolved in chloroform and myristic acid in hexane ( both from merck , analytical grade ) , to a concentration of @xmath65 , and approximately @xmath66 of the solution was carefully spread on the water surface . +",
    "the film was then compressed step - by - step , and bragg peaks were recorded at each ( fixed ) pressure step .",
    "the total time required to record the bragg peaks and bragg rods was typically 3 hours per step .",
    "all the crystals investigated in this study have a two - dimensional rectangular ( distorted hexagonal ) unit - cell ( fig.1 ) . in the @xmath0 ( smectic @xmath67 according to the liquid crystal terminology ) and @xmath2 ( smectic @xmath68 ) phases , molecules are tilted towards one of their six nearest neighbors , whereas in the @xmath1 ( smectic @xmath69 ) phase they are tilted towards one of their six next - nearest neighbours . in the more ordered @xmath3 ( smectic @xmath70 ) and @xmath4 ( smectic @xmath71 ) phases , there is no molecular tilt .",
    "phase diagrams of behenic and myristic acids can respectively be found in references @xcite and @xcite . + the peak positions measured in the horizontal plane for the two different fatty acids at different temperatures are given fig.[pic22 ] and [ pic14 ] , where the corresponding phases are indicated .",
    "for all these phases , only the two lowest - order diffraction peaks are observed , corresponding to the \\{1,1 } ( degenerate ) and \\{2,0 } ( non - degenerate ) bragg reflections ( cf fig.[nn ] ) .",
    "the @xmath72 spacing of the corresponding diffracting planes can be very simply derived from the powder - diffraction peak position @xmath54 ( obtained as well as the hwhm by fitting the peak with a lorentzian ) by : @xmath73 .",
    "both cell parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 , characterizing the size of the rectangular cell in the horizontal plane , are hence precisely determined from the diffraction data .",
    "the molecular area is then given by @xmath76 .    the tilt angle can be extracted from the rod - scans in the following way .",
    "the maximum intensity in the bragg rod is obtained when the wave - vector transfer @xmath77 is perpendicular to the molecular axis , whose direction is given by the director @xmath78 .",
    "from the relation @xmath79 we get : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the azimuthal angle between the projections of @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the horizontal plane .",
    "hence the \\{1,1 } peak , for which @xmath81 is never equal to @xmath82 , has a non - zero @xmath83 component in all tilted phases ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the \\{2,0 } peak has a non - zero @xmath83 component only in the @xmath1 phase ( @xmath84 ) , since @xmath85 in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 phases .",
    "the value of @xmath83 , which can be obtained from the rod - scans , coupled to the knowledge of the tilt direction ( which can itself be deduced from the number of peaks having a @xmath83 component ) , leads to the value of the tilt angle .",
    "the cell parameters and tilt angle deduced from the peaks positions are given fig.[cell22 ] for @xmath62 and fig.[cell14 ] for @xmath64 .",
    "phases might be classed according to their cristallization direction(s ) @xcite .",
    "some of them ( the lower temperature phases : @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) are supposed to be 2d crystals , with long - range positional order in two directions . other intermediate phases ( @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath86 ) should have long - range order in one direction ( perpendicular to the tilt direction for tilted phases ) , but not in the other .",
    "finally hexatic phases ( @xmath87 ) obtained for higher temperature have no long - range positional order at all .",
    "the most straightforward way to track long - range positional order is to consider the bragg peak widths , inversely proportional to the correlation length of the diffracting planes .",
    "the half width at half maximum of the peaks are plotted in fig.[peakwi ] .",
    "the situation appears to be different for the @xmath2 and @xmath4 phases ( lower inset ) : whereas @xmath4 has two resolution - limited peaks , supporting the fact that it is , indeed , a 2d crystal , @xmath2 has one resolution - limited peak , and one very narrow but not resolution limited peak , possibly implying that cristallization along @xmath74 ( parallel to the molecular tilt ) is not perfect .",
    "the anisotropy in correlation lengths of the intermediate phases ( middle inset ) appears clearly with @xmath86 phase , whose two peaks have very different widths . as for @xmath2 phase",
    "though , the expected cristallization ( along @xmath75 this time ) is not perfect , since the corresponding \\{2,0 } peak is not quite resolution - limited . in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 phases ,",
    "the anisotropy of cristallization is difficult to determine , since both peaks correspond to bragg planes in directions with no long - range order , and are consequently broad .",
    "the increase in correlation length can although be noticed , when passing from @xmath1 to @xmath3 .",
    "the hexatic phase ( @xmath87 , upper inset ) has inequally broad peaks , showing that though neither principal direction possess long - range order , one of them ( perpendicular to the molecular tilt ) is ordered on a longer scale .",
    "it is interesting to compare the isotherms obtained by determining the molecular area from the trough area and the quantity of product spread with those derived from the x - ray measured molecular area .",
    "this is presented in fig.[iso1 ] and fig.[iso2 ] .",
    "one can see that the pressure rises later for microscopically determined areas , owing to the fact that the film is inhomogenous .",
    "this point has been stressed in ref.@xcite ; the actual ( x - ray measured ) molecular area is in fact smaller than the assumed molecular area , which takes into account large surfaces deprived of film .",
    "however , the molecular areas obtained using the trough area and the spreaded amount are smaller at higher pressure than those determined by using the x - ray derived molecular areas : this is due to the loss of amphiphilic molecules , either in the subphase , through the barriers , or by collapse .",
    "for all these reasons , one can see that compressibilities can not be reliably determined from a standard isotherm , and that only diffraction data can bring reliable results .",
    "also , the diffraction data can give access to the anisotropic linear compressibilities , which is not the case when using the standard isotherms .",
    "for behenic acid at @xmath88 , the trough isotherm shows a @xmath1 phase that has not been observed with x - rays , possibly because its range of existence is very small .      a good way to look at the data , as was pointed out by kuzmenko et al .",
    "@xcite , is to consider the parameter cells in the transverse plane , and to plot the transverse parameter @xmath89 against the transverse parameter @xmath90 , as illustrated in fig.[banana ] .",
    "this way of plotting the data allows one to put emphasis on the kind of molecular packing and will help us to better understand the negative linear compressibilities obtained in the transverse plane ( see below ) .",
    "phases are distributed on an arc , the extremities of which correspond to densely packed phases ( with backbone ordering ) , and center to less densely packed phases ( with no backbone ordering ) .",
    "there are two possible backbone arrangements for carbon chains @xcite : herringbone ( hb ) or pseudo - herringbone ( phb ) as shown in fig.[phbhb ] .",
    "backbone packing strongly influences the size and shape of the rectangular cell , which is why backbone ordered phases are distributed on either end of the arc , depending on whether they achieve hb or phb packing .",
    "almost all phases possessing backbone ordering ( ie . in our case @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) have hb packing .",
    "the only known phase with phb packing is a particular type of the so - called @xmath0 phase , @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the other type @xmath87 possesses no backbone ordering , and in consequence has a quasi hexagonal cell ( @xmath91 ) , which places it in the middle of the arc .",
    "upon decrease of temperature , the system stays on the arc , passing from its center ( undistorted unit - cell , molecules free to rotate around their axis ) , to one of its ends ( molecules with a definite azimuthal position ) .",
    "the rescaling with chain length of the phase diagram of fatty acids @xcite implies that for a same temperature , molecules with shorter chains will organize in less dense phases ( i.e. at higher @xmath90 and @xmath89 , placing them more in the center of the arc ) .",
    "this is in complete agreement with our results , which place the @xmath0 phases of @xmath64 almost exactly in the middle of the arc ( making them @xmath87 phases , perhaps with a faint phb ordering ) , and all the phases of @xmath62 towards the extremities . for @xmath64",
    ", @xmath92 gives acces to `` high temperature phases '' , whereas for @xmath62 , @xmath93 still leads to `` low temperature phases '' .",
    "the first interesting remark about fig.[banana ] is that for the same temperature , under compression , the transverse cell roughly keeps its area ( deplacement along a line where the product @xmath94 is constant ) , but it jumps from one end of the arc ( phb ) to the other ( hb ) when passing from @xmath86 to @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "these two particular phase transitions involve a complete rearrangement of the cell around its central molecule , since not only the backbone packing , but also the transverse cell dimensions undergo a discontinuous change ( this discontinuity does not exist in the in - plane parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) .",
    "this jump is of particular interest to us , since it might explain some unexpected features of the compressibilities we measured , as will be explained below .",
    "the second interesting remark about fig.[banana ] is that the spread of points of the different phases have very different extensions and directions .",
    "this can be related to an anisotropy in transverse compressibility ( that will be developed in the next section ) , and compared with the anisotropy in cristallization .",
    "the @xmath87 phases roughly extend in the direction of a `` constant geometry '' line ( for which the ratio @xmath95 stays constant ) , showing an equivalent compressibility in both the @xmath90 and @xmath89 direction .",
    "the @xmath86 and @xmath2 phases extend in a direction of constant @xmath89 , indicating a stronger compressibility along @xmath90 , whereas the @xmath1 and @xmath3 phases extend in a direction of constant @xmath89 , related to a larger compressibility along @xmath90 . for the @xmath4 phases ,",
    "the extension of the spread of points on the diagram is almost null .",
    "the different compressibilities calculated from our data are given in table [ tab ] for the two different compounds and in the different phases studied .",
    "the compressibilities range from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , and , surprisingly , three distinct orders of magnitude can be clearly identified : around @xmath98 for the tilted phases , @xmath99 for the @xmath3 phase , and @xmath100 for the @xmath4 phase . + because the different phases are anisotropic , it is interesting to discriminate along the different directions in order to better understand this hierarchy of compressibilities .",
    "the most interesting linear compressibilities are those along the unit - cell axes @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath101 , and the anisotropy is best visualized by building polar diagrams representing the magnitude of the linear compressibility along a given direction ( i.e. the relative distortion along that direction under an isotropic 2d stress ) as a function of the angle that this direction makes with the unit - cell axes .",
    "such polar diagrams can be constructed using the relations [ pl ] and [ tr ] of section 2 .",
    "they are represented in fig.[ch1 ] ( with the same scale ) for the different phases we investigated .",
    "polar diagrams make it obvious that most phases have a highly anisotropic compressibility .",
    "in fact , the only isotropic phase , from the point of view of compressibility is the @xmath4 phase .",
    "the other extreme is represented by the @xmath2 phase for which the linear compressibilities @xmath102 and @xmath103 differ by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the anisotropy might be traced back either to the anisotropy induced by the tilt direction ( in - plane compressibilities of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 phases ) , or to the anisotropy induced by 1d cristallization like in the @xmath3 phase ( see also fig.[ch1b ] ) .",
    "let us recall to this point that tilted phases have their long - range positional order direction perpendicular to their tilt direction ( transverse @xmath0 compressibilities ) , and the @xmath3 phase , perpendicular to the tilt direction of the @xmath1 phase from which it originated upon compression .",
    "+ the central result of this paper which summarizes these data is fig.[nuage ] , where the linear compressibilities along the @xmath74 and @xmath75 axes are represented on a log - log scale .",
    "different regions corresponding to compressibilities presumably associated with different mechanisms can be clearly identified on this figure , where the anisotropy is also most clearly visible .",
    "the largest linear compressibilities are observed in the @xmath104 ( right , central ) , @xmath1 ( central , top ) and @xmath2 ( right , bottom ) phases in the tilt direction .",
    "the lowest values are observed in some phases and directions where the layer possesses a long range positional order , that is in both direction in the @xmath4 phase ( left , bottom ) , in one direction of the @xmath3 phase ( left , central ) , and in one direction of the @xmath2 phase .",
    "they have to be related to the compression of already well organized molecular planes .",
    "the intermediate values are found in the transverse plane , in one direction of the @xmath3 phase and of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases .",
    "they correspond to some directions having no long - range positional order ( the @xmath75 direction of @xmath3 ) , and others generally expected to have it ( the @xmath75 direction of @xmath0 and the @xmath74 direction of @xmath1 ) . + one can make abstraction of the effect of tilt by looking at the linear compressibilities in the transverse plane normal to the molecular axis .",
    "a transverse compressibility @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the transverse area of the cell , and a tilt compressibility @xmath107 ) can then be defined .",
    "@xmath108 describes the part of the compressibility due to the untilting of the molecules .",
    "if the molecules are tilted along @xmath74 , one can also write @xmath109 , or @xmath110 if they are tilted along @xmath75 . for the orthorombic phases , the in - plane and transverse compressibilities are of course equal ( @xmath108=0 ) .",
    "the polar diagram resulting from the linear compressibilities in the transverse plane are represented in fig.[ch1b ] .",
    "transverse linear compressibilities are mainly interesting in the tilt direction where they differ from the in - plane compressibilities . in the @xmath0 phase ,",
    "linear compressibilities are reduced in the tilt direction from @xmath111 in the sample plane to @xmath112 , i.e. larger but on the order of the intermediate compressibilities mentioned above .",
    "more unexpected is that @xmath113 in the @xmath1 phase and @xmath114 in the @xmath2 phase are negative .",
    "+ finally , it is interesting to note the strong correspondance between linear compressibilities and correlation lengths : the tilted phases only exhibits very short range positional order along the tilt direction where the compressibility is very large , the @xmath4 phase has 2d long - range order , and no noticeable ( on the diagram ) compressibility in either direction , @xmath86 and @xmath3 have 1d cristallization , and show larger compressibilities in the direction where they are not cristallized .",
    "we first summarize the theory of elasticity of thin plates as a basis for the discussion .",
    "the four different sets of compressibilities ( large compressibilities in the tilted phases , intermediate compressibilities along the direction without tilt nor true long - range order , low compressibilities in the crystal phases , and negative linear compressibilities in the transverse plane ) will then be discussed with the aim of assigning a molecular mechanism to each of them .",
    "+ the central result of the theory of elasticity for thin plates @xcite is that the compressibility is proportional to the plate thickness @xmath115 : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the young modulus and @xmath118 the poisson ratio .",
    "of course this is not necessarily a realistic model , but the same trends remain in more realistic approaches : if one is only interested in the interactions between the chains ( which up to now are believed to be the relevant part of the amphiphilic molecules ) , three essential contributions to the film free energy must be considered@xcite : attractive van der waals forces which ensure the film cohesion , the entropy of conformation defects and their energy ( which must be included to account for phase transitions ) .",
    "it turns out that all these components roughly scale proportionally to @xmath119 @xcite , the number of segments , and it will therefore also be the case for the compressibility which is the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the area .",
    "+      the compressibilities of the tilted phases are the largest that we observe ( @xmath120 , see table [ tab ] ) .",
    "the expectation that the compressibilities should scale with the segment number ( i.e. a factor of @xmath121 between myristic and behenic acid ) is in strong contrast with our experimental observation that the compressibilities of behenic acid and myristic acid in the @xmath0 phase at @xmath122 are identical . indeed all our results tend to indicate that the compressibility of tilted phases are remarkably independent of chain length ( and also of film thickness since the compressibilities do not depend on the tilt angle ) .",
    "this , and other experimental observations detailed below , leads us to propose a reconsideration of the respective roles of aliphatic tails and headgroups in the physics of amphiphilic films .",
    "in particular we propose here that the compressibility of tilted phases could be due to the elasticity of the hydrogen - bounded headgroup network .",
    "that would also explain the puzzling observation that the compressibilities of behenic acid in the @xmath2 and myristic acid in the @xmath0 phase at @xmath123 are equal ( and significantly different from their values at @xmath122 ) .",
    "+ further evidence that the role of headgroups needs to be reconsidered is as follows : + firstly , the so - called `` universality '' of the phase diagrams is only relevant for molecules having different chain lengths but the same headgroup .",
    "as soon as different headgroups are considered like alcohols or esters , significant differences appear in the phase diagram topology @xcite .",
    "also striking is the fact that in some cases very high pressures can be achieved with molecules that remain tilted throughout the whole phase diagram , which can not be understood if the chains only are relevant@xcite .",
    "+ secondly , the data of fig.[transv ] add very interesting evidence to this interpretation .    whereas at a given surface pressure , the molecular areas of behenic acid and myristic acid are very similar , as one would expect if the interactions between headgroups are dominant and fix the area , this is not the case for the transverse area which differ by more than @xmath124 : we measured @xmath125 and @xmath126 at respectively @xmath122 and @xmath127 for behenic acid and @xmath128 and @xmath129 at @xmath123 and @xmath130 for myristic acid .",
    "( note that the reduction in molecular area is roughly @xmath131 when the temperature is decreased by @xmath132 , or about @xmath133 when the chain length is increased by 8 segments , hence leading to the equivalence @xmath134 in good agreement with what is obtained from the transition temperatures in ref.@xcite , around @xmath135 to @xmath136 per @xmath137 group .",
    ") moreover the tilt angle is larger for behenic acid than for myristic acid at the same pressure in the @xmath0 phase ( on the order of @xmath138 for myristic acid and of @xmath139 behenic acid ) .",
    "+ if the molecular area is mainly to be fixed by the headgroup interactions , one does expect the same molecular area whatever the chain length as is observed , and the differences in cross - section and tilt angle can be understood as follows : because the van der waals interactions are stronger between @xmath62 chains than between @xmath64 chains due to their larger length , the number of defects is smaller and their cross - section is also smaller ( i.e. the transverse area as experimentally observed ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to have a larger tilt angle to achieve the projected area than for shorter , more disordered chains with a larger cross - section .",
    "+ finally , the temperature dependance of the compressibilities of the tilted phases presents interesting features .",
    "whereas the compressibility of behenic acid in the @xmath0 phase only slightly decreases from @xmath140 to @xmath141 , the compressibility of myristic acid significantly increases between @xmath141 and @xmath142 from @xmath111 to @xmath97 ( the same happens for behenic acid but the phase at @xmath142 is now @xmath2 ) .",
    "the same increase is reported in ref.@xcite for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases of behenic acid .",
    "this could be related to the anomalous properties of water near @xmath143 due to the hydrogen bound network .",
    "the intermediate compressibilities obtained in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 phases along the directions where there is neither tilt nor long range order are on the order of @xmath144 .",
    "it has been proposed on the basis of a landau theory of weak crystallization in ref.@xcite that the absence of true long range order could be related to the imperfect ordering of the backbone planes .",
    "the compressibility would then be due to the ordering of the molecule positions .",
    "an order of magnitude of the corresponding energy can be obtained from our data by comparing the compressibilities of the @xmath3 phase and @xmath4 phase along @xmath75 , since they both have the same cell geometry and packing ( hb ) , but the @xmath3 phase has true long - range order only along @xmath74 , whereas the @xmath4 phase is a 2-d crystal . if one assumes that the energy @xmath145 necessary to squeeze out the defects is equal to the elastic energy necessary reduce the cell parameter @xmath75 from its large value in the @xmath3 phase to its low value in the @xmath4 phase , then @xmath146 , using a simple spring model .",
    "@xmath147 is the variation of the @xmath148 parameter of the cell , that goes from @xmath149 to @xmath150 for one molecule during the transition .",
    "this variation is representative of the transition from a disordered state to a crystallized state in the b - direction .",
    "@xmath103 is the linear compressibility along @xmath75 in the @xmath3 phase @xmath151 . with these numbers , one obtains @xmath152 , to be compared to the the thermal energy @xmath153 , indicating that defects are rather rare , which is consistent with a coherence length of @xmath154 interatomic distances in the ill - crystallized direction of the @xmath3 phase .",
    "the lowest compressibilities where obtained in the @xmath4 phase and along the `` well crystallized '' directions @xmath75 in the @xmath2 phase and @xmath74 in the @xmath3 phase .",
    "they are on the order or smaller than @xmath155 .",
    "it is interesting to compare these values to those obtained for 3d polymer crystals , in particular for orthorombic polyethylene which has a structure similar to that of the @xmath4 phase .",
    "the values of the linear compressibilities for orthorombic polyethylene reported in ref.@xcite are @xmath156 along @xmath74 and @xmath157 along @xmath75 .",
    "let us note that the 2d pressure @xmath9 is homogenous to @xmath158 and not @xmath159 , which will cause our elastic coefficients to be in @xmath160 . to be compared to the elastic coefficients of similar 3d materials",
    ", the bidimensional compressibilities will have to be multiplied by the thickness of the layer ( here @xmath161 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath162 along @xmath74 or @xmath75 in quite good agreement with the values for polyethylene .",
    "the fact that the compressibility of a film is slightly larger than that of a 3d crystal can probably be explained by a larger number of defects . in any case , the compressibility of the 3d polyethylene crystals could be nicely estimated by using only a pairwise intermolecular potential including a short range repulsive exponential potential and long range attractive van der waals forces for a perfect crystal order with no defects , and one confidently assign the same molecular origin to the lowest compressibilities of fatty acids , i.e. repulsive interactions between methyl groups in a well crystallized solid .",
    "negative transverse linear compressibilities are only observed in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 tilted phases .",
    "we propose an explanation for the negative linear compressibilities on the basis of the transition between phb and hb packing as follows : looking at fig.[pass ] , one can see that the transition from @xmath0 to @xmath1 or @xmath2 implies a dramatic change in the transverse cell parameters ( this can also be seen in fig.[banana ] ) . in each case one of the transverse parameters ( @xmath89 for @xmath163 and @xmath90 for @xmath164 ) increases instead of decreasing upon compression .",
    "they happen to be exactly the same for which the negative transverse linear compressibilities are observed upon further compression .",
    "it is therefore likely that upon further compression after the phb to hb transition the unit cell is still reorganizing in the transverse plane towards a preferred geometry , implying negative linear compressibilities .",
    "an important consequence is that the second mechanism presented in fig.[pass ] ( along the diagonal ) for the transition from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , corresponding to a @xmath165 change of the tilt direction , is ruled out , since it would involve a negative compressibility along @xmath90 in the @xmath1 phase , and not along @xmath89 .",
    "this result was already suggested by brewster angle microscopy @xcite .",
    "the linear compressibility of a two - dimensional fatty acid crystal has been measured for the first time .",
    "surprisingly , the linear compressibilities can be nicely divided in 4 sets depending on their value which is characteristic of the phase and direction of crystallization , and a different molecular mechanism could be ascribed to each set .",
    "this lead us in particular to propose to reconsider the role of headgroups .",
    "+ the largest compressibilities ( 10 m / n ) are observed in the tilted phases .",
    "they are apparently independant on the chain length and could be related to the reorganization of the headgroup hydrogen - bounded network .",
    "the intermediate compressibilities observed in the directions normal to the molecular tilt in the @xmath0 or @xmath1 phases and in the @xmath3 phase in the direction without true long range order could be related to the progressive squeezing of defects in those phases .",
    "the lowest compressibilities observed in the solid untilted @xmath4 phase and for one direction of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 phases are similar to the compressibilities of crystalline polymers .",
    "they correspond to the interactions between methyl groups in the crystal .",
    "finally , the negative compressibilities observed in the transverse plane for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 and can be traced back to subtle reorganizations upon untilting .",
    "+ work is in progress in order to solve some remaining puzzling questions : + is it possible to further demonstrate that the compressibility of tilted phases is mainly due to interactions between headgroups by measuring the compressibility for different headgroups and observing large variations ?",
    "+ does compressibility really decrease with increasing temperature in those phases and what is the underlying mechanism ?",
    "+ what is the dependence of the compressibility on film thickness ( i.e. chain length ) in the untilted phases ?",
    "+ answering those questions would allow a better understanding of the compressibility of two - dimensional langmuir film crystals and open the way for a more quantitative theoretical approach . + * acknowledgements : * the help of c. blot during the experiments is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "this work greatly benefited from discussions with v.m .",
