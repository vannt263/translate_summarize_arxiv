    "there are many ways to detect @xmath0 rays such as gas - flow counters and solid - state detectors@xcite , but all detect the corresponding ionization signal by the incident @xmath0 ray , instead of @xmath2 itself . however , because @xmath0 particles travel only a few centimeters in the air and can be easily stopped by a piece of thin foil or paper , it is harder to detect their rays than those of beta or gamma radiation .    in this work , we suggest a new method of @xmath0 ray measurement that aims to detect @xmath2 neutral atoms .",
    "if one wants to measure @xmath0-emitting radioactivity in bulk material with ordinary detectors , one has to rely on @xmath0 rays emitted from the thin surface of the material because of their short range .",
    "however , many materials diffuse stopped @xmath0 particles out of their surface in the form of neutral helium atoms .",
    "the amount of the released helium atoms can then be measured by a quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) in terms of the mass number @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , there is the advantage of being able to measure @xmath0-emitting radioactivity in bulk materials .",
    "it can be seen that a higher sensitivity for alphas can be expected .",
    "to examine our method of @xmath0-ray measurement , we used an amersham x.825 disc type @xmath4 @xmath0 source ( fig .",
    "[ am241-view ] ) and a vacuum system including a qms .",
    "the @xmath4 source , an @xmath0-emitter with a half life of @xmath5 y , is covered with epoxy resin 25 mm in diameter and 3 mm in thickness .",
    "this source emits @xmath6 alphas per second , which eventually stop in the resin and diffuse out as @xmath2 neutral atoms .",
    "the time needed for diffusion in resin is negligible compared to the time elapsed of about 10 years or more after the production of this @xmath0 source .",
    "therefore , the helium production rate of the source is thought to be the same as that of alpha ( @xmath6 s@xmath7 ) . a quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) is often used for trace element analysis because of its high isotopic selectivity and efficiency@xcite .",
    "the qms we used is a pfeiffer vacuum qms200 with a channeltron detector .",
    "the mass range is @xmath8 and the detection limit is @xmath9 pa @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 source .",
    "the central `` point '' is @xmath4.,width=151 ]    the experimental setup is shown in figs . [ sche - view ] and [ photo - view ] .",
    "a liquid nitrogen trap was introduced to capture unwanted out - gas especially from the resin .",
    "we controlled the valves , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ photo - view ] ) , to measure the integrated qms channeltron current @xmath12 of helium as follows :    1 .",
    "draw a vacuum to @xmath13pa with both valves ( @xmath14 ) open .",
    "2 .   keep valve @xmath10 closed for @xmath151h,4h,10h and 20h to accumulate helium atoms from the source .",
    "the number of helium atoms expected was @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "3 .   after closing valve @xmath11 , open valve @xmath10 to introduce helium atoms to the qms through an orifice for a couple of seconds . 4 .   open valve @xmath11 to introduce most of the remaining atoms at one time for helium detection .    in our qms system , the bypass valve @xmath11 and the orifice(@xmath180.3 mm )",
    "are placed for a high pressure sample gas . here",
    ", we utilized them in step ( c ) to avoid a drastic change in the channeltron current measured by the qms , which was observed with just @xmath10 open after step ( b ) .",
    "considering the conductance of the orifice , the amount of helium atoms lost in step ( c ) is estimated to be less than 2@xmath19 , so we measured the integration of the channeltron currents for 5 seconds after opening valve @xmath11 in step ( d ) .",
    "the integration time of 5s was determined after considering the time needed for opening valve @xmath11 by hand ( @xmath20 ) and the evacuation time @xmath21s ( @xmath225s ) expected by the pumping speed of our vacuum system .    to estimate the amount of spurious signal caused by the out - gas from the resin , we also measured channeltron currents against a @xmath23 source as a control covered with the same epoxy capsule as the @xmath4 source . assuming that both sources are emitting out - gas of similar composition and amount , the net integrated channeltron current @xmath12 can be defined as the difference between the integrated current @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the @xmath4 and the @xmath23 source , respectively , under the same accumulation time @xmath26 . in terms of @xmath27 described above",
    ", @xmath12 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the elementary charge , @xmath30 is the amplification factor of the channeltron , and @xmath31 is the detection efficiency of the qms , i.e. , the ratio of the number of helium atoms detected by the qms compared to the initial quantity @xmath27 . note that @xmath27 and @xmath12 are proportional to the accumulation time @xmath26 .",
    "we measured a set of @xmath24 and @xmath25 twice for each @xmath151h,4h,10h and 20h .",
    "[ result - example ] shows a few examples of the experimental result for @xmath15 20h , 10h and 4h . a clear difference between two sources can be seen for the data of @xmath15 20h and 10h .",
    "the difference can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ result - example]-(c ) ( @xmath15 4h ) , though a drastic change in the channeltron current makes it unclear .",
    "[ prop ] shows the relationship between the accumulation time @xmath26 and the net amount of helium @xmath32 with the best fit under the assumption of linearity . here , because of the difficulty in evaluating the exact error of @xmath12 , we estimated it at @xmath25 for each data point , which may be a conservative overestimation .",
    "the unclarity for the data of @xmath15 4h described above is reflected in the error bars in this figure .",
    "the best - fit proportionality coefficient @xmath33[c / h ] corresponds to @xmath34 according to eq.([q - he ] ) .",
    "we can see certain degree of linearity between @xmath26 and @xmath12 , but the obtained detection efficiency @xmath31 was rather small , probably because most of the helium atoms were evacuated by the vacuum pump before they got ionized .",
    "c +   +     and @xmath12 ( @xmath35).,width=453 ]    to estimate the ultimate detection limit under this system apart from the influence of the out - gas coming from the epoxy capsule , we measured the distribution of @xmath36 , the background channeltron current without any sources integrated for 5 seconds , as shown in fig .",
    "the best fit to the data by the normal distribution is also shown in the figure . in this way",

    ", the factor @xmath40 is introduced to take into account the two sets of the data , the @xmath4 and the @xmath23 source , that were used for detecting the helium signal .",
    "the obtained @xmath38 corresponds to @xmath41 helium atoms under our system .",
    ".,width=453 ]    although we did not try to obtain higher detection efficiency @xmath31 with this measurement , since the valves were controlled manually , there are some possible solutions to improve @xmath31 :    * atom buncher @xcite + an atom buncher is a cold trap to capture target gas atoms .",
    "it consists of a metal surface that often is cooled by liquid helium .",
    "some kinds of laser can be used to temporarily heat a spot on the surface to evaporate gas atoms .",
    "the detection efficiency @xmath31 would improve if the heated area is placed close to the ionization chamber of the qms .",
    "this device can be applied to the detection of helium by cooling the surface to a temperature low enough to trap the helium atoms .",
    "* pulsed supersonic valve @xcite + the pulsed supersonic valve(psv ) is an electromagnetic device to generate supersonic free gas jet .",
    "this valve consists of two parallel metallic plates as a gate for the sample gas .",
    "the gas is only allowed to be temporarily introduced when the gate is opened by electromagnetic repulsion between these two plates .",
    "the jet of sample gas is then injected into the ionization chamber .",
    "similar to the atom buncher described above , higher @xmath31 can be achieved by locating the psv near the ionization region of the qms .",
    "attaching devices such as an atom buncher and a psv to improve detection efficiency and so obtain a higher @xmath31 , much smaller quantities of helium atoms could be detected than under our present system .",
    "also , some qms are said to be able to count target atoms one by one@xcite , so our system could theoretically be improved to detect a single helium atom ; that is , each @xmath0 ray regardless of its energy if the detection efficiency @xmath31 gets close to one .    our method can be applied to the accurate estimations of @xmath0-induced soft errors in very - large - scale integrated circuit ( vlsi ) .",
    "soft errors are caused by @xmath0 rays from a minute amount of radioactive substance in lsi packages , and have become a serious problem in vlsi circuits@xcite . using mass analysis in vacuum may enable us to reduce the detection limit of @xmath0-emitting radioactivity in the packages compared to the conventional method with a gas flow proportional counter .",
    "we proposed a new method for alpha(@xmath0 ) ray measurement by detecting helium atoms with a qms .",
    "an @xmath4 @xmath0 source and a @xmath23 source as a control were used to examine our method .",
    "the result showed that we could successfully detect helium atoms , but the detection efficiency was only @xmath42 under our system .",
    "additional devices such as an atom buncher and a psv to improve detection efficiency may allow us to reduce the detection limit .",
    "this detector can not measure the energy of the @xmath0 particles , but that feature is reasonably common to many other conventional @xmath0 detectors and is not a shortcoming in most applications .",
    "our method may become practicable to choose low @xmath0-active material for lsi packages , which is essential to reduce @xmath0-induced soft error rates in vlsi circuits .",
