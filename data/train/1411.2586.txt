    "the lorentz transformation admits eigenvectors @xcite .",
    "these eigenvectors correspond to definite directions in spacetime , which seems to imply that there exist preferred directions in spacetime .",

    "if @xmath2 performs experiments to determine the direction in spacetime of the eigenvector of the lorentz transformation , will @xmath3 measure the same direction in spacetime for his lorentz transformation eigenvector ?",
    "+ as a more specific example , consider a copy of @xmath4 equipped with a coordinate system . define a linear transformation @xmath5 and assume @xmath2 to have two distinct , real eigenvectors .",
    "there is an ambiguity in this definition due to the arbitrariness in the selection of a coordinate system . for if    @xmath6    then @xmath7 a rotation of the coordinate system results in different eigenvectors .",
    "+ if the lorentz transformation @xcite is written in the form    @xmath8    then a  spacetime rotation \" by an angle @xmath9 would have the form    @xmath10    which is distinct from a purely spatial rotation as it involves the time coordinate .",
    "the matrix ( [ spacetimerot ] ) can be written as    @xmath11    let @xmath12 be the frame of reference induced by the @xmath1 transformation .",
    "an observer in this frame might perform an experiment to measure the eigenvectors of the lorentz transformation in his frame .",
    "that is , he would look for eigenvectors of @xmath13 and would measure these .",
    "in other words , the speed of light would be constant under a lorentz transformation in the @xmath12 frame .",
    "in fact , all of special relativity carries over unchanged into @xmath12 .",
    "if such a transformation @xmath1 is possible , then there must be some means by which its effects can be measured .",
    "it will be shown that such a transformation does indeed exist , and that its effects are well known .    to this end , introduce three observers : @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath12 .",
    "each of these observers are initially positioned at the origin .",
    "suppose @xmath15 to be at rest , and let @xmath16 be subjected to a lorentz transformation @xmath0 with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath12 be subjected to a transformation @xmath1 with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "the question before us is how might @xmath15 distinguish between @xmath16 and @xmath12 ?",
    "it is sufficient to work in a single spatial dimension and time .",
    "we have    @xmath17    and    @xmath18    we note two differences between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transformations ; the leading  gamma \" factors contain a sign difference , and the @xmath19 matrix elements have opposite signs .",
    "to describe the effects of these differences , we follow de broglie @xcite and set up two simple wave functions for particles at rest - one for @xmath16 : @xmath20 and another for @xmath12 : @xmath21    we next apply the respective transformations to these wave functions to study their appearance in the @xmath15 frame .",
    "we have    @xmath22    and    @xmath23    giving    @xmath24    and    @xmath25    where we have made the substitutions    @xmath26    and    @xmath27    we can discuss the phase and group velocities for @xmath28 and @xmath29 once we have determined their respective dispersion relations . solving ( [ kl ] ) and ( [ omegal ] ) for @xmath30 and equating ,",
    "we find :    @xmath31    likewise for @xmath32 and @xmath33    @xmath34    now we calculate the phase and group velocities . for the lorentz transformation case , @xmath0",
    ", we derive the familiar relations    @xmath35    and    @xmath36    in contrast , for the transformation @xmath1 we derive    @xmath37    and    @xmath38    this result highlights the essential difference between a lorentz transformation @xmath0 and a spacetime rotation @xmath1 ; the phase velocities are identical , but the group velocities are oppositely directed .",
    "equivalently , one can say that it if two objects acquire the same velocity , one by virtue of applying @xmath0 and the other by applying @xmath1 , they possess oppositely directed phase velocities ( figure 1 ) .",
    "+     ( solid lines ) and @xmath1 ( dashed lines ) ]    the significance of this result can be made clear by examining the energy - momentum relation for the two cases .",
    "@xmath39    or , adding a potential @xmath40 @xcite    @xmath41    for small @xmath42 this becomes    @xmath43    which is the nonrelativistic energy - momentum relation . applying the standard prescription @xmath44 to convert this into a quantum mechanical statement we arrive at the nonrelativistic shrdinger equation    @xmath45    separating out the time dependence ,",
    "@xmath46    we recognize the time independent shrdinger equation . + repeating the above procedure to derive the energy - momentum relation under the @xmath1 transformation ,",
    "we find :    @xmath47    expanding this relation to second order about @xmath48 gives    @xmath49",
    "if we postulate that prescription ( [ prescription ] ) holds good for tunneling - transformed particles , we find the time - dependent shrdinger equation in this case takes the form    @xmath50    comparing ( [ lorentz time independent se ] ) and ( [ tunnel time independent se ] ) , we clearly see the difference between a test particle whose rest frame has been  lorentz transformed \" and another test particle whose rest frame has been transformed by @xmath1 . transforming a particle by @xmath1 is nothing less than the well - known phenomenon of * quantum tunneling * , seen here in a new light .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the physical reality of the proposed new spacetime rotation , and suggests that we identify the new @xmath1 transform as the  tunneling \" transform since its effect is simply to transform a test particle from rest to a tunneling state .",
    "it can be shown that the tunneling transform arises from relativistic proper acceleration .",
    "proper acceleration is defined as that which a test particle experiences within its rest frame @xcite .",
    "the worldline of a test particle undergoing proper acceleration @xmath51 is given by    @xmath52    as before , let the observer @xmath15 be at rest , and let @xmath16 be the lorentz - transformed frame .",
    "we want @xmath16 to be uniformly accelerated by a constant value @xmath51 .",
    "we require the velocity of all points of @xmath16 to increase simultaneously .",
    "since simulataneity is relative , we specify that this acceleration is with respect to the frame @xmath15 ; @xmath53 is then a function of @xmath54 alone .",
    "@xmath55    we want to calculate    @xmath56    for fixed @xmath57 , at time @xmath58 .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath59 initially .",
    "this gives    @xmath60    that is , @xmath61 grows linearly with @xmath57 , and according to general relativity , this is precisely the definition of a static homogeneous gravitational field @xcite @xcite .",
    "therefore , for constant acceleration in spacetime we can write    @xmath62    this is nonlinear , but if we expand @xmath63 in the neighborhood of an event @xmath64 we can write    @xmath65    repeating the previous analysis of the de broglie wave , we make the identifications    @xmath66    and calculate the phase velocity as    @xmath67    for group velocity we need @xmath68 .",
    "but there is no functional relationship between @xmath69 and @xmath70 unless there is a relationship between @xmath57 and @xmath54 .",
    "we can create such a relation by specifying a path through spacetime and calculating the group velocity along that path , one can find a group velocity of any value .",
    "therefore we should only choose events which might actually describe the path of a particle . ] .",
    "if we set @xmath71 , for example , we find a group velocity of    @xmath72    it remains to find the conditions by which the phase velocity @xmath73 and the group velocity @xmath74 have opposite directions , which is the hallmark of the tunneling transformation .",
    "since , for example , we are free to choose @xmath75 , we only require    @xmath76    or    @xmath77    it is interesting to note that if we multiply ( [ tunnelcriterion ] ) by a parameter @xmath78 , then this relation is equivalent to    @xmath79    if @xmath78 is interpreted as the rest mass of a test particle , then @xmath51 is identified as the acceleration of the static homogeneous field .",
    "the klein  paradox \" is not really a paradox at all @xcite @xcite .",
    "it has long been recognized as the inadequacy of single particle quantum mechanics to describe what is actually a multiparticle process .",
    "a summary of the phenomenon is as follows .",
    "a test particle encounters a step potential , and the wave function splits into a reflected part which moves away from the step , and a transmitted part which tunnels into the step .",
    "the difficulty arises when the height of the potential step rises beyond a certain threshold , @xmath80 , where @xmath78 is the rest mass of the test particle .",
    "it is instructive to analyze this process within the paradigm of the new tunneling transform .",
    "the initial work with the klein paradox was performed within the context of the dirac equation @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , it can also be analyzed in the context of the klein - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "we proceed as follows . from schiff @xcite , we start with the energy - momentum relation for @xmath0 :    @xmath81    assuming v to be a constant and making the substitutions ( [ prescription ] ) we derive the ( one dimensional ) klein - gordon equation for a test particle encountering a step potential :    @xmath82     + the solutions are oscillatory so long as    @xmath83    this means that the test particle must have enough energy after surmounting the potential @xmath40 to still possess a nonzero kinetic energy and also account for its rest energy . if    @xmath84    then the test particle has no excess energy after accounting for the rest energy .",
    "this is a turning point ; the kinetic energy and momentum of the test particle at this point are @xmath85 .",
    "if the potential is increased a bit more , then    @xmath86    and there is no excess energy with which to form momentum . to an observer at rest",
    ", the test particle is said to have entered a  tunneling state \" which is often interpreted as a state of imaginary momentum .",
    "the tunneling transformation offers a more intuitive interpretation . starting with the energy - momentum relation for @xmath1 ( [ emrelationtunnel ] ) :    @xmath87    the klein - gordon equation for a test particle in a step potential now takes the following form :    @xmath88    refer to figure 2 , which compares the energy - momentum relations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we can interpret tunneling as the test particle converting its rest energy into a source of momentum .",
    "this can continue until all of the rest energy has been converted into momentum , i.e , when    @xmath89     and @xmath1,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this is the largest value of momentum possible for this test particle . the entire kinetic energy as well as the rest energy of the particle has been converted into momentum ; @xmath90 .    here",
    "we have only reached the point where @xmath91 , or in the case of a test particle with no initial kinetic energy , just @xmath92 . at this point , the phase velocity is 0 .",
    "the tunneling transform has rotated the frame of the test particle by @xmath93 . here",
    "the tunneling transform has the form    @xmath94    if we continue the tunneling transform through higher angles , we move into the regime where we are on the negative branch of the energy @xcite :    @xmath95    and @xmath96 is begins decreasing from its maximum value of @xmath97 .",
    "this is recognized as an antiparticle state ; the tunneling transform has continuously converted the test particle into an antiparticle . as @xmath96 continues to decrease",
    ", it eventually reaches @xmath98 .",
    "it is at this point that we reach the threshold of the klein paradox , an antiparticle at rest .",
    "@xmath99    or    @xmath100    .    a final note about  group velocity \" .",
    "the phase velocity of the wave function for a test particle at rest is infinite .",
    "this , of course , does not mean that any physical object is moving at an infinite rate .",
    "it simply means that the set of events we are referring to appear to be simultaneous with respect to a particular observer . in the same way ,",
    "what is a  group velocity \" to one observer can appear to be nothing more than a set of simultaneous events to another observer , so long as their respective frames are related by a tunneling transformation .",
    "therefore the apparent difficulties with a constant time rate gradient ( e.g. apparently  infinite \" group velocities ) are not an issue when the frames are related by a tunneling transformation .",
    "we supplement the lorentz transformation with a newtunneling \" transformation which is nothing more than a rotation in spacetime .",
    "test particles subjected to this tunneling transformation are tunneling particles ; their essential property is that they observe a reversal in the direction of phase velocity with respect to group velocity .",
    "we have shown that the tunneling transformation follows from the relativistic analysis of a static , homogeneous field .",
    "finally , we apply the tunneling transformation to the klein paradox , and see that it is nothing more than the spacetime rotation of a tunneling particle into its antiparticle ."
