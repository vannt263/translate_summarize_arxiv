    "ngc 2264 is an open cluster in the monoceros ob1 association containing a large population of young stars .",
    "the cluster has been the focus of a number of studies of early stellar evolution dating back to the work of @xcite .",
    "ngc 2264 is an ideal target for such studies because of its low line - of - sight extinction and minimal optical nebular emission @xcite .",
    "in addition , most background stars are obscured from the cluster by the presence of a large molecular cloud complex @xcite .",
    "previous distance determinations for ngc 2264 have favored a distance of 800 pc , although there has been considerable spread around this value : 800 pc by @xcite , 760 pc by @xcite , 760 - 950 pc by @xcite , 750 pc by @xcite ; see @xcite for a complete summary of previous distance measurements .",
    "these distance estimates have been primarily derived by fitting empirically or theoretically defined main sequences to the location of high mass ( b and a type ) stars in the hr diagram . although extensive stromgren narrowband photometry is available in the literature @xcite , it has not yet been used to refine distances to these early type stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an improved distance estimate to ngc 2264 would lower the uncertainties in the luminosities derived for cluster members , which in turn constrain the cluster s age . as one of the premiere laboratories for studying star formation in the milky way , a better estimate of the age of ngc 2264 would further our understanding of processes relevant to early stellar evolution such as angular momentum transfer and the lifetime of circumstellar disks . in this paper",
    ", we determine the distance to ngc 2264 using a statistical technique that relies on measured projected rotation velocities , rotation periods , luminosities and effective temperatures of the low mass k & m type cluster members .",
    "the technique was first developed by @xcite and has subsequently been used to find distances to the pleiades , the taurus star forming region , and the orion nebula cluster  @xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage of being nearly independent of stellar evolutionary models .      in brief , we first measure the projected rotational velocities of cluster members , @xmath2 ( where @xmath5 is the tangential velocity of the stellar surface at the equator and @xmath1 is the inclination of the stellar rotational axis on the sky such that @xmath6 implies an edge on orientation and @xmath7 implies a pole on orientation ) from existing high - resolution spectra of ngc 2264 members @xcite .",
    "an effective temperature , @xmath8 , is estimated for each star from either its spectral type or dereddened photometry .",
    "luminosities , @xmath9 , are estimated for cluster members from measured magnitudes by assuming a nominal value for the cluster distance , a prescription for the cluster reddening , and a standard bolometric correction .",
    "stellar radii are then calculated from the estimated luminosities and effective temperatures using the stefan - boltzmann relation .",
    "the final data needed for the distance determination are rotation periods obtained from fits to periodic variations in the stellar light curves .    bringing all of these data together",
    ", we calculate @xmath0 for each star as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the measured rotation period and @xmath12 is the stellar radius ( the subscript indicates that the measured radius is dependent on the stellar luminosity , which depends on the assumed cluster distance , @xmath13 ) .",
    "[ eq : sini ] allows us to generate an observed distribution of @xmath0 that is dependent on the adopted cluster distance .",
    "we then model the distribution of @xmath0 assuming that the rotational axes of stars in the cluster are randomly oriented . by scaling the input cluster distance so that the observed @xmath0 distribution matches the predicted distribution",
    ", we obtain an estimate for the true cluster distance .",
    "we begin in @xmath14[data ] with a description of the data used to determine the distance to ngc 2264 ; @xmath14[vsinidetermination ] describes our measurement of projected rotation velocities by applying a cross - correlation routine to high resolution spectra of cluster members ; @xmath14[distancedetermination ] describes the distance determination technique in detail ; our results are discussed in @xmath14[discussion ] .",
    "as described above , our distance measurement relies on @xmath0 values for stars in ngc 2264 .",
    "four types of data are needed to calculate @xmath0 for an individual star using eq .",
    "[ eq : sini ] : the star s period , luminosity , effective temperature and projected equatorial rotational velocity , @xmath2 . period ( @xmath14[periodsub ] ) , effective temperature ( @xmath14[teffsub ] ) and luminosity ( @xmath14[lumsub ] ) data were obtained from a catalog compiled by @xcite and are briefly described below .",
    "most of the @xmath2 data , on the other hand , were calculated from spectra ( @xmath14[spectrasub ] ) using a cross - correlation technique further discussed in @xmath14[vsinidetermination ] .",
    "rotation periods for pre - main sequence stars are determined by measuring periodic variations in the objects brightness .",
    "these variations arise from the presence of large ( @xmath15 angular radius ) starspots on the surfaces of these young , magnetically active stars @xcite .",
    "the transit of the starspot(s ) as the star rotates diminishes the observed stellar luminosity on the order of a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "this variation is quite stable and can be used to derive precise periods",
    ".    @xcite compiled periods measured for members of ngc 2264 by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the period measurements range from roughly 0.5 to 29 days and are predicted to be accurate to roughly @xmath16 .",
    "the catalog assembled by @xcite includes @xmath8 estimates derived from low - resolution spectral types and from the stars optical colors using the @xmath17 vs. t@xmath18 relation presented by @xcite .",
    "each star s @xmath17 color was dereddened prior to this calculation as described by @xcite : stars with spectra were dereddened so that their observed @xmath19 colors matched the intrinsic colors of that spectral type on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) defined by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 colors for stars without spectra were dereddened assuming the modal reddening of members with measured spectral types . while the use of an overall reddening for the cluster is less than ideal , out of a total of 97 stars for which we derive @xmath0 values , only 14 lack spectral types . thus , larger errors associated with photometric based @xmath8 measurements likely have a negligible effect on our results .",
    "t tauri stars almost certainly do not have a single photospheric temperature , however ; observations of the weak t tauri star v410 by @xcite indicated the presence of two large , polar star spots with characteristic temperatures of 3100 k , in constrast to the star",

    "spot temperature differentials , and typical spot covering fractions of @xmath410% @xcite .",
    "somewhat counterintuitively , however , star  spots are unlikely to introduce large errors in a star s derived photospheric temperature , particularly for large spot  photosphere temperature differentials .",
    "the star s integrated emission is dominated by non - spotted photospheric flux , as the cooler spots emit significantly less flux per unit area .",
    "observational confirmation of this effect was provided by @xcite , who constructed detailed star ",
    "spot models of rs cvn systems to reproduce broadband photometric light curves and temperature sensitive line ratios from temporally resolved , high resolution spectra of rs cvn systems . while the best fit models identified by @xcite possessed photosphere  spot temperature differentials of @xmath41000 k , the temperature sensitive spectroscopic line ",
    "ratios only departed from the photospheric value by @xmath4150 k over the course of the observations .    in their appendix",
    "a , @xcite outline a formalism for calculating the mean temperature observed from a star with a given spot covering fraction and photosphere  spot temperature differential . using this formalism , we calculated the difference between a t tauri star s true ( non - spotted ) photospheric temperature and the temperature that would be measured from its integrated ( spot @xmath20 photsphere ) spectrum . for typical t tauri star parameters ( t@xmath21=4000",
    "k ; t@xmath22= 3200 k ; f@xmath22 = 0.1 ) , the temperature measured from the combined spot@xmath20photosphere i  band spectrum would be 3992 k , only 8 k different from the ` true ' photospheric temperature .",
    "given the small size of this effect , we assume the uncertainties in our derived temperatures are dominated by errors in the observed colors , spectral types , and reddening corrections .",
    "we expect the temperature uncertainties introduced by these effects are roughly @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite calculated luminosities for cluster members from dereddened photometry , assuming a distance to the cluster of 760 pc .",
    "stars without previously determined spectral types were dereddened by the modal reddening value determined for stars with spectral types .",
    "not taking into account the uncertainty associated with the distance assumption , the observed luminosities are likely accurate to within @xmath24 .",
    "this estimate includes contributions from uncertainties in spectral type , extinction values , and uncertainty due to source variability @xcite .",
    "we note that the luminosity we calculate for each star from its measured photospheric temperature will likely be a slight over  estimate , as some fraction of the star s surface will be covered with cooler , less luminous star  spots . again using the formalism presented by @xcite in their appendix a , we calculated the expected scale of this effect . for our typical t tauri star ,",
    "the bolometric luminosity calculated assuming a single measured photospheric temperature ( ie , t@xmath25=3992 k ) is 5% larger than the true luminosity assuming the correct spot  photosphere differential and covering fraction .",
    "as the scale of this effect is well within our errors , and as we lack a robust characterization of the spot properties for the stars in our sample , we simply adopt the luminosity implied by the single temperature associated with each star s spectral type .",
    "spectra for 923 stars in and around ngc 2264 were obtained from the sample observed by @xcite using hectochelle @xcite , a multiobject echelle spectrograph located on the 6.5 m multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) .",
    "the spectra cover a wavelength range of 6450 to 6650  and have a resolution of @xmath26 , providing velocity resolution of @xmath4 9 km / s . a typical spectrum obtained for a star in ngc 2264",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ typical_spectrum ] .",
    "because few stars in our initial catalog had previously measured @xmath27 s , it was necessary to extract this data from the spectra of @xcite . to make this measurement",
    ", we used a cross - correlation technique similar to that developed by @xcite .",
    "the correlation parameter , @xmath28 , between a target ( i.e. a cluster member ) and a well - matched template spectrum is determined as a function of the radial velocity of the template spectrum , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath28 is obtained by inverse fourier transforming the product of the discrete fourier transforms of the target and template spectra @xcite . to generate @xmath28 ,",
    "we have developed a custom cross - correlation routine in idl based on a heavily modified version of a routine originally developed by @xcite .",
    "the location of the peak of @xmath28 corresponds to the value of @xmath29 for which the target and template spectra are best matched .",
    "thus , the correlation procedure provides us with a measure of @xmath29 for stars in our sample .",
    "furthermore , because rotational broadening of the target star s spectral lines results in a broader @xmath28 peak , the width of the @xmath28 peak , @xmath30 , provides a measure of @xmath2 for the target star .",
    "the correlation function @xmath28 resulting from cross - correlating one of our target spectra with a template spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ typical_cc ] .",
    "the accuracy of the kinematic properties measured by the cross - correlation technique depends on the quality of the agreement between the strength and shape of the spectral features present in the template and target spectra . to ensure that the target and template spectra are reasonably well matched , we correlate each target spectrum against a grid of template spectra covering a range of temperatures and surface gravities ( see @xmath14[template_grid ] ) .",
    "the best matching template is then used to derive @xmath2 for that target .",
    "the degree of ` matching ' between a template spectrum and a target spectrum is quantified with a statistical quantity , @xmath31 , defined as the ratio of the height of the maximum peak in @xmath28 to the root - mean - square of the antisymmetric component of @xmath28 @xcite . in an idealized scenario",
    "in which the target spectrum has no noise , the correlation function would be perfectly symmetric around some particular value of @xmath29 . @xmath31",
    "therefore measures the strength of the correlation function peak against the noise in @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the template that produces the largest @xmath31 value when correlated against a particular target can be said to be the optimal template for that target .",
    "we cross - correlated our targets against a set of templates calculated by @xcite .",
    "the template grid covers temperatures ranging from @xmath32 k to @xmath33 k in increments of @xmath34 k and @xmath35 ( surface gravity ) values ranging from @xmath36 to @xmath37 in increments of @xmath38 .",
    "because the strength of the h@xmath39 line at 6562  exhibits strong dependence on accretion that could potentially interfere with our ability to derive @xmath2 values , each spectrum was divided into two regions bracketing h@xmath39 ( a ` blue ' region at wavelengths below 6545  and a ` red ' region at wavelengths greater than 6585  ) .",
    "both regions were then correlated separately with the template spectra .",
    "subsequent analysis revealed that our ability to derive accurate @xmath2 values was greater for the cross - correlations performed on the red region .",
    "this effect was likely due to the fact that the @xmath28 peaks tended to have a more gaussian shape for the red cross - correlations .",
    "thus , in future discussions @xmath31 refers to the value of @xmath31 calculated for the red region .",
    "the relationship between @xmath30 and the target @xmath2 was calibrated separately for each template spectrum by cross - correlating the template spectra with synthetic target spectra for which @xmath40 is known .",
    "the synthetic target spectra were created by introducing artificial rotational broadening into the template spectrum and degrading the spectral resolution and sampling to match the hectochelle data .",

    "[ vsini_distribution ] shows the distribution of @xmath2 values for stars in our sample .",

    "yields a distance estimate to ngc 2264 of @xmath96 pc .",
    "our distance measurement includes statistical uncertainties due to sampling effects , as calculated above , but also potential systematic errors due to the assumptions that underlie our models . factors that could introduce systematic errors into our analysis include : the error prescriptions and binary fraction adopted in our calculation of @xmath64 ; the @xmath2 cutoff we imposed on our modeled and observed @xmath0 distributions ; biases in the stellar properties derived for stars as a function of their evolutionary state ; and finally , the underlying assumption of isotropically distributed rotation axes .",

    "the solid line represents the case where all of the errors are chosen randomly from the actual error distributions , and the remaining curves represent cases where the errors in a particular variable have been set to 0 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ ks_errs ] that the assumed errors have a non - negligible impact on both the best - fit distance as well as the height of the @xmath92 curve .",
    "for instance , negating the luminosity errors has the effect of reducing the best - fit distance by 4 % , while eliminating the @xmath8 errors increases the best - fit distance by roughly 6 % .",
    "eliminating the @xmath47 errors not only increases the best fit distance by 4 % , but also strongly reduces the peak @xmath92 , suggesting that the errors in @xmath2 contribute significantly to the shape of the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "to the extent that the error distributions we adopt in our model ( see @xmath14[error_distribution ] ) do not reflect the true error distributions of our data , our distance estimate will be skewed .",
    "as shown above , the error distributions we do adopt are influencing our derived distance at the @xmath45% level , suggesting any systematic error in our derived distance due to adopting improper error distributions would likely be @xmath45% as well .",
    "our error distributions , however , are consistent with those estimated by other authors for the same parameters , and the error distributions push the derived distance in different directions , such that multiple systematic errors should offset one another to some degree .",
    "perhaps most worrisome is the asymmetric shape of the luminosity error distribution , but lacking a more robust means of characterizing the luminosity errors , we are unable to remove this potential systematic effect from our analysis . fig .",
    "[ ks_binary ] shows the effect of the assumed binary fraction on the best fit distance .",
    "as the binary fraction is increased , the average luminosity of the modeled stars is increased , causing the @xmath0 distribution to move to lower @xmath0 as per eq .",
    "[ sinim ] . in order for the observed @xmath0 distribution to remain well matched to the modeled distribution",
    ", the assumed distance must therefore increase according to eq .",
    "[ sinil ] .",
    "thus , we see that as the modeled binary fraction changes from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , the best - fit distance goes from @xmath97 pc to @xmath98 pc , a change of roughly 13% .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , who found in his onc study that increasing the binary fraction by 0.2 led to a 4% increase in his modeled best fit distance .",
    "biases in the parameters derived for stars in different evolutionary states could also the results of our analysis .",
    "as noted by @xcite , it may be more difficult to derive accurate temperatures , luminosities , and , thus , radii for classical t tauri stars than more evolved weak t tauri stars ; classical t tauri stars typically possess larger extinctions , are irregularly variable , and have significant contributions to their total luminosity from accretion and re - radiation from their circumstellar disk , all of which can complicate the derivation of their intrinsic stellar properties . following @xcite , we used an irac [ 3.6 - 8 ] color cut to identify classical t tauri stars in our sample ; when these cttss are excluded from our sample , the best fit distance to ngc 2264 increases to @xmath4950 pc .",
    "this effect is contrary to that seen by @xcite , who found a decreased best fit distance to the onc once cttss were excluded from his sample . given these contradictory results , and that the effect of removing cttss from our sample is comparable to the other systematic effects probed here , we have chosen not to exclude cttss from our main analysis .",
    "our technique assumes that all of the stars in ngc 2264 are at the same distance from earth . in reality , the cluster has some line of sight depth , predicted to be on the order of 28 pc @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the known members of ngc 2264 are biased towards low extinctions , this could cause the distance we derive to the cluster to be slightly smaller than the true geometric center of the cluster .",
    "the distance we derive here , however , would properly describe the distance of the population of currently known members ; we do not consider this to be a systematic error in our analysis , but rather a nuance that should inform the interpretation of our results",
    ".    finally , the fundamental assumption of random axial orientations is itself somewhat questionable since stellar clusters like ngc 2264 are predicted to have collapsed from single cloud complexes .",
    "we might expect , then , for there to be a preferred orientation of stars in the cluster resulting from the conservation of the cloud s initial angular momentum , or possibly from the presence of large scale magnetic fields .",
    "previous applications of the @xmath0 distribution technique have , however , produced results that are in agreement with precise parallax measurements @xcite .",
    "this agreement provides evidence in support of the random axial orientation assumption , but it has not been directly confirmed by observations .    the discussion above has revealed a number of potential systematic effects in our analysis .",
    "the five potential systematics most amenable to direct investigation ( the inclusion of cttss in our primary sample ; the adopted luminosity , temperature , and @xmath2 error distributions ; and the assumed binary fraction ) all influence the derived best fit distance at the @xmath4 5% level .",
    "we therefore combine these individual uncertanties in quadrature to characterize the potential error in our best fit distance due to systematic effects , producing a estimate of our total systematic uncertainties of @xmath99 12 % , or 110 pc .",

    "the luminosities of pre - main sequence stars are often compared with predictions of theoretical pre - main sequence models to infer the age of their parent cluster ; as luminosity declines through the pre - main sequence phase , the larger luminosities produced by assuming a greater distance to the cluster will produce a younger inferred age for the cluster .",
    "increasing the assumed distance to ngc 2264 from 760 to 910 pc changes the distance modulus by 0.4 mag .",
