    "there has been a renewed interest in higher dimensional solutions to einstein field equations .",
    "several interesting vacuum static / stationary solutions @xcite , the methods of their generations @xcite and study @xcite , as well as some general results on uniqueness of higher dimensional static vacuum black holes @xcite,@xcite , @xcite in @xmath2 dimensions have appeared recently . in the case of time - dependent geometries ,",
    "the main interest is to study higher dimensional spacetimes as backgrounds for string propagation @xcite . in cosmology",
    "@xcite , the new trends impose  lifting \" the cosmological models to higher dimensions .",
    "another , and probably the most relevant reason to study the higher dimensional generalizations of the einstein equations stems from the fact that we live in a four dimensional world .",
    "it would be important then , if we were able to convince ourselves , by studying the higher dimensional solutions , that there is something special , unique and deep about four dimensions .",
    "this could only be done if we study the alternatives .",
    "much work has been done previously @xcite , yet , since the interests move with time , the motivation , and with it the boundary / initial conditions imposed on the solutions change as well . in solving einstein equations ,",
    "one usually imposes some sort of symmetry .",
    "what we are good at is the situation where the spacetime does not depend on more than two , preferably non - null variables . in four dimensions",
    "these are known as the so - called @xmath3 solutions .",
    "almost all known interesting four - dimensional solutions of einstein equations in vacuum , electrovacuum or with some fundamental matter fields belong to this class and contain at least two commuting killing directions .",
    "once we are confronted with the situation where the line element _ does _ depends on at most two coordinates , we are in  business \" : whether these are stationary solutions with axial symmetry , boost - symmetric spacetimes , anisotropic ( isotropic ) and inhomogeneous ( homogeneous ) cosmologies , cylindrical , or plane gravity and matter waves - there are dozens of generating techniques , algorithms etc . to construct new solutions of ever increasing complexity @xcite starting from more simple seeds . because of their generality , on one hand , and applicability , on the other , the known @xmath3 solutions provide a perfect  seed \" or a building block to construct further new solutions .",
    "the construction of families of higher dimensional solutions is not an exception : one can efficiently use the known @xmath3 solutions as the seeds in order to construct their higher dimensional generalizations and analogues . as usual , the physics enters via the boundary and initial conditions ( asymptotic flatness , clean horizons and singularities in the case of compact objects ; singularity structure , inflation , late / early - time acceleration - for cosmological models etc . )",
    "obtaining sufficiently general solutions , of course , does not necessarily mean alleviating the search for specialty and physical meaningfulness , nevertheless , the understanding of the sufficiently general class of solutions may shed some light on a problem .",
    "the above considerations lead us to the main purpose of this paper : the construction , in a possibly most simple and controllable way of higher dimensional vacuum solutions to einstein equations which depend , at most , on two variables .",
    "our starting point would be the @xmath4-dimensional vacuum seed metrics with the @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "the vacuum seed spacetime will be generalized to include massless dilatons , which will serve to lift the solutions to higher dimensions . to include the scalar field ,",
    "the vacuum line element would be written in the coordinates especially adopted for this matter .",
    "it happens so , that in these coordinates the scalar dilaton coupled to gravity in the @xmath3 case satisfies a linear differential equation .",
    "this equation can be easily solved with the general solution representing a linear combination of some elementary solutions .",
    "any term , as well as , any linear combination of these solutions , may serve to lift the dilaton spacetime to higher dimensions , obtaining in such a way a new vacuum solution in any dimension greater than @xmath4 . to get interesting solutions , one must choose the  right \" @xmath3 seed as well as the right combination of elementary scalar solutions ( dilatons ) .",
    "the scheme works both , in the case when the two commuting killing vectors of the  seed \" are spacelike ( cosmologies , cylindrical waves , colliding waves etc . ) as well as , when one of the killing vectors is timelike .",
    "it is important to mention that there is no need in imposing the hypersurface orthogonality of the two killing directions ( diagonality of the metric ) and therefore , the solutions obtained this way generalize , in the case when one of the killing directions is timelike , for example , the static higher dimensional solutions due to @xcite , enabling to obtain the generalized stationary solutions , in fact , an infinite dimensional family of such solutions .    in the following section we briefly review the generating technique for the case where the two killing directions of the seed solution are both spacelike . in sec .",
    "iii the case with one timelike killing vector is addressed . in sec .",
    "iv the method is specialized to the 5-d case ; aspects such as asymptotic flatness and the interpretation of the method as the insertion of rod sources are as well included in this section . in sec .",
    "v , we analyze the trapping of surfaces , horizons and singularities of the generated solutions . in secs .",
    "vi and vii some 5-d static and stationary solutions are generated .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "the case and the algorithm where the two killing directions of the seed solution are both spacelike , was first presented and discussed in the context of string / m - theory cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is worth , however , to briefly review it here since actually passing to the situation when one of the killing vectors is timelike , can be formally made by complex coordinate changes which will be given subsequently .",
    "the starting point is the _ vacuum solution _ of the einstein field equations in the form    [ er ] ds^2=e^f^vac(-dt^2+dz^2)+_abdx^adx^b .    here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 coordinates alone , @xmath9 and we denote @xmath10 .",
    "we also assume that the scalar field is normalized as in @xcite and @xmath11 expressed as a sum of elementary scalar fields solves the following linear differential equation [ kg1 ] [ k(t , z)(t , z)]- [ k(t , z)(t , z ) ] = 0 .",
    "then , the solution to the coupled einstein - scalar field equations is obtained @xcite by keeping the transverse part characterized by the metric functions @xmath12 and @xmath6 without being changed , but replacing the longitudinal function @xmath13 by    f(t , z)^vac f(t , z)^vac + f(t , z)^sc .",
    "the function @xmath14 , then , is solved by quadratures from :    ( t , z)^sc= ,    f(t , z)^sc = .    to lift the solution to higher dimensions and to obtain the vacuum spacetime",
    ", we first construct the new scalars @xcite @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is given by    =( ) ,    along with    @xmath17    where @xmath18 .",
    "finally , the @xmath19-dimensional vacuum solution is given by :    [ higher ] ds^2_4+n = e^-_i=1^n_i ds^2_4 + _ i=1^ne^_i ( dw^i)^2 , where @xmath20 is the four - dimensional scalar field solution constructed previously . the new scalars @xmath21 need to be constructed only when one is seeking a solutions in more than @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "in the 5 dimensional case the lifting from 4 dimensions involves directly the field @xmath22 and is straightforward .",
    "the case of all spacelike killing vectors is phenomenologically rich .",
    "depending on the behavior of the function @xmath12 , the so - called transitivity surface area , one encounters distinct physical situations depending on the character of the gradient of @xmath23 .",
    "this function , in a vacuum , electrovacuum or massless scalar case , due to the vanishing of the two - trace in @xmath24 of the stress tensor , is necessarily a solution of the wave equation of the form :    ( t , z)-k(t , z)=0.[wave ]    the solutions @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 are often used in the studies of anisotropic and inhomogeneous cosmologies and in colliding wave solutions .",
    "the case @xmath28 corresponds to einstein - rosen cylindrical waves etc .",
    "for all these cases the general solutions of the klein - gordon eq .",
    "( [ kg1 ] ) are known and well understood .",
    "for example , the different modes of the solution for the case @xmath25 can be written as    = + l\\{a_j_0(t ) } + + l \\{b_n_0(t ) } + _ i d_iarc ( ) , where @xmath29 indicates linear combinations of the terms in curly brackets , @xmath30 can have a discrete or continuous spectrum and @xmath31 are constants .",
    "the @xmath32 terms are somewhat special in the sense that these can not be written as fourier - bessel integrals @xcite and are often referred to as gravitational solitons @xcite due to the relation to the inverse scattering technique where these terms usually pop up . in a more general case ,",
    "when the gradient of @xmath23 may vary from point to point and we are interested in either cosmologies with @xmath33 topology of spatial sections , as it happens in the case , for example , of bianchi ix models , gowdy models or in a colliding wave problem , the function @xmath23 may be taken as @xmath34 , and the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ kg1 ] ) can be expanded in legendre polynomials of the first and second kind ,    & = & _ 1|| + _ 2 ||+ _",
    "3|| + & & + _ = 0^ , where @xmath35 are constants .",
    "in cosmology one is often interested in the solutions for which the gradient of the transitivity surface @xmath23 is globally timelike because most of the homogeneous models have this property . in this case one",
    "may choose @xmath25 as a solution of eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) .",
    "the contribution of the scalar field to the function @xmath36 becomes then    ( t , z)^sc= t(_i=1^n_i^2 + _ i=1^n_i^2 ) ,    f(t , z)^sc = 2t_i=1^n_i_i.    as a seed let us take , for example , the vacuum kasner solution for which one has :    ds^2 = e^f(t , z)(-dt^2 + dz^2)+ t(e^p(t , z)dx^2 + e^-p(t , z)dy^2 ) , with p= k , f= .    the scalar field equation becomes now @xmath37 , and one may take the simplest homogeneous solution as :    = a.    choosing the inhomogeneous scalar field solution would have lead to an inhomogeneous scalar field generalization of the kasner ( bianchi i ) model , and when lifted to higher dimensions would have produced inhomogeneous vacuum solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "the corresponding function @xmath38 becomes :    f= .",
    "the vacuum 5-d solution is then easily obtained using the expressions above , and has the following synchronous form :    ds^2 = -dt^2+t^adz^2+t^bdx^2+t^cdy^2+t^ddw^2 , where    @xmath39",
    "we now turn to the case where one of the killing vectors is timelike .",
    "this situation corresponds to the stationary axially symmetric spacetimes .",
    "the procedure to build higher dimensional solutions is similar to the previously discussed one but with some minor sign changes , once an adapted coordinate system is used .",
    "surprisingly , little is known on scalar field generalizations of axially symmetric spacetimes .",
    "basically , this is due to the fact that scalar field stationary axisymmetric solutions are probably not that exciting . unlike in cosmology , where the scalar fields play central role in inflation , dark matter and dark energy models , the interest in scalar field generalizations of axially symmetric solutions of the einstein field equations is rather scarce .",
    "one of the reasons as to why the scalar fields in axisymmetric spacetimes are of little interest , is because these do not admit , apart from some very special cases , a perfect fluid description as in cosmological case , where the scalar field serves as velocity potential for the fluid .",
    "moreover , the various no - hair theorems @xcite exclude scalar field black holes in 4-dimensions .",
    "several specific solutions , however , in the spherical case , kerr - type generalizations @xcite and the case with conformally coupled scalar fields @xcite are known . a specific algorithm which converts a gravitational degree of freedom into a scalar field",
    "is also known @xcite , but is less adapted for the purposes of this paper .    our starting point , this time , is the following line element @xcite :    [ as ] ds^2=e^^vac(dr^2+dz^2)+_abdx^adx^b , which we take to be a _ solution _ of the vacuum einstein equations in @xmath4 dimensions . the function @xmath40 and @xmath6 are now functions of @xmath8 and @xmath41 alone and @xmath42 . in this case ,",
    "as long as the determinant of @xmath43 is not a constant , we may take without any lost of generality @xcite ,    = -r^2 .",
    "we now assume , as in the previous section , that the scalar field @xmath11 is a solution of the following equation :    _ rr + _ r+_zz=0 .",
    "[ kg ]    this equation is easily obtained from the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg1 ] ) of the previous section with the following change of coordinates @xmath44 and is a consequence of the formal relationship between the @xmath3 - generalized einstein - rosen class , and the @xmath3 - stationary axially symmetric class metrics . if the vacuum solution is globally diagonalizable ( the static weyl case ) then the  weyl potential \" @xmath45 which appears as a metric function @xmath46 ( see appendix a ) , solves exactly the same eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) as @xmath22 .",
    "the general solution to the linear eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) is obtained by considering the following integral :    = ^_=-^2_=0 .",
    "it is convenient , nevertheless , in a way analogous to the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ kg1 ] ) , to express the solution of the eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) as a superposition of the following terms :    & = & + l\\{a_j_0(r ) } + & & + l \\{b_n_0(r ) } + _ i d_iarc ( ) , where the @xmath47 terms are the weyl - analogs of the @xmath48 terms , and can be written as :    - .",
    "the arbitrary constant @xmath49 is often called a soliton  pole \" and may be either real or complex in which case one must take @xmath50 $ ] or @xmath51 $ ] as the solution . if the soliton has a real pole , then the pole is directly related to the  rod \" structure of the weyl solutions .",
    "in fact it is an interesting way to exactly perturb the solitonic solutions by allowing the poles @xmath49 to  catch \" some imaginary part @xmath52 , see for example @xcite .",
    "it is simple to show that the solution to the coupled einstein - scalar field equations ( see appendix a ) , independently whether static or stationary , can be obtained by keeping the transverse part characterized by the metric function @xmath6 without a change , but with the longitudinal function @xmath53 replaced by    ( r , z)^vac ( r , z)^vac + ( r , z)^sc .",
    "the function @xmath54 is then solved by quadratures from : ^sc_r = r , [ fr ]    ^sc_z = 2r .",
    "[ fz ]    to find the above expressions one can either , directly work with the einstein equations as in @xcite , or put in the previous all - spacelike killing vector case @xmath25 and perform formally the following coordinate transformation :    tr , ziz , xi , yt .",
    "one should also perform a global signature change after wick rotating the solution if one desires to maintain the same signature .",
    "equation - wise , but not solution - wise , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the case of all spacelike killing vectors and the case when one of the killing directions is timelike .",
    "some solutions do not have stationary analogue and vice versa , especially , when the two pertinent killing vectors are not hypersurface orthogonal . in the diagonal case , however , all the solutions can be formally  copied \" from one case to another .    from here",
    "one may now use the previous lifting expressions for @xmath15 and the eq .",
    "( [ higher ] ) to construct the higher dimensional solutions . before proceeding any",
    "further , some remarks are in order . in the static axially symmetric case ,",
    "the @xmath4 dimensional solutions of the vacuum einstein equations depend just on one function @xmath45-the weyl potential , which as mentioned above , solves eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) with @xmath55 in vacuum or in the scalar case . in the higher dimensional case",
    "there may be an extra scalar degree of freedom for each extra dimension . in the stationary case",
    ", one should allow for an additional rotational degree of freedom , but , at any rate , we assume that the vacuum 4 dimensional solutions are already given and do not enter into their generation - there is little to add on what is already known in this field @xcite .",
    "a separate remark is about what kind of solutions are  interesting \" for the scalar field in the higher dimensional generalization of axially symmetric solutions .",
    "we believe that those of interest happen to be the same solutions as the ones producing interesting weyl potentials ( the solitonic terms ) : @xmath56}\\equiv \\log{r}+ { \\rm arc } \\sinh{[(z+a)/r]}$ ] , @xmath57 and their linear combinations .",
    "note that the linear eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) allows solutions obtained by reflection ( @xmath58 ) , by shift ( @xmath59 ) as well as by multiplying the solution by an arbitrary constant @xmath60 . moreover , if a complex function @xmath22 is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) , then both the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath22 are also solutions .",
    "let us now specialize to a 5-dimensional case .",
    "the above described procedure of constructing a 5-d generalization of the axially symmetric solutions may be put in a more compact statement .",
    "consider we have a vacuum solution to the einstein field equations in 4-dimensions of the form :    ds^2= -e^u ( dt+ad)^2+e^-ur^2d^2+e^^vac(dr^2+dz^2 ) .",

    "( [ kg ] ) and @xmath61 is given by    ^sc_r = r ( _ r^2- _ z^2 ) , [ fr1 ]    ^sc_z = 2r_r_z .",
    "[ fz2 ]    thus we see that the construction of the vacuum generalizations of the 4-d axially symmetric solutions is reduced to simple algebra .      before aplying the algorithm to generate the stationary solutions we may start by copying the already known solutions obtained with the two space - like killing vectors into stationary solutions .",
    "obviously most of these  copies \" will not have interesting physical properties .    to exemplify such a direct copying of solutions from cosmology to their weyl analogue , we consider the open scalar friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe . to construct",
    "a scalar field frw cosmology with open spatial section one starts with the following solution to the vacuum einstein equations :    @xmath62    and  dresses \" it with the scalar field :    = .",
    "immediately one gets a solution which describes an isotropic homogeneous universe with spatial sections of negative curvature @xcite ,    ds^2= ( -dt^2+dz^2 ) + ( dx^2 + cotanhzdy^2 ) .    to pass to weyl coordinates , we first choose :",

    ". physically , the weyl analogues of the open frw universe have nothing to do with the original solution and probably have little relevance as static solutions .",
    "we have presented this here only to exemplify the procedure of  copying \" .",
    "dealing with the stationary axisymmetric solutions , one often imposes the asymptotically flat behavior of the line element away from the axis ( @xmath63 ) . in 5 dimensions ,",

    "<S> we show how one can systematically construct vacuum solutions to einstein field equations with @xmath0 commuting killing vectors in @xmath1 dimensions </S>",
    "<S> . the construction uses einstein - scalar field seed solutions in 4 dimensions and is performed both for the case when all the killing directions are spacelike , as well as when one of the killing vectors is timelike . </S>",
    "<S> the later case corresponds to generalizations of stationary axially symmetric solutions to higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> some examples representing generalizations of known higher dimensional stationary solutions are discussed in terms of their rod structure and horizon locations and deformations . </S>"
