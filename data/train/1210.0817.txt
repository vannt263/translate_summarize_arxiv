    "when the most of nuclear fuel of a star has been consumed , there is nothing that resists against the inward gravitational pressure and collapse occurs . at the end of gravitational collapse will born a compact star which can be white dwarf , neutron star or black hole . in white dwarf",

    "they showed that for such system a hypermassive neutron star results and black hole is not promptly formed after the onset of the merger as long as the total mass of the system is smaller than @xmath5 .",

    "the production mechanism of high - energy neutrinos is the decay chain of charged pions and muons @xmath8 these pions are produced by accelerated protons @xcite to high energies in the system via the photon - hadron interactions @xcite and inelastic hadronic processes @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the target photon .",

    "based on these argumentations , we divide collapse process into infinitesimal steps where in each step the system is in its thermodynamic equilibrium state , which we call the adiabatic approximation @xcite .",
    "in addition to these thermodynamic equilibrium equations there are conserved quantities , which are total electric charge number , total baryon number and total lepton number of each flavor @xcite .",
    "we consider the collapsing star as a complete degenerate fermi gas of neutrons , protons and electrons because the temperature is much smaller than their fermi energies @xcite .",

    "when collapse proceeds density of star reaches to the amount that muon then pion can be produced in the system . as a result , in addition to the electron neutrinos which are already produced by @xmath12-processes , in companion to the muon production , muon neutrinos are produced . using number of produced neutrinos and assumption of 10% @xcite of gravitational binding energy converted to the energy of produced neutrinos , we compute the mean energy of neutrinos .",
    "we study neutrino oscillation effects on the primary flux , and compute the number of antineutrino events in an ordinary detector such as kamiokande .",
    "the total energy of neutrino flux is another relevant quantity to observations and we compute it in this article .",

    "in this paper , we approximately consider compact stars , white dwarf and neutron stars , as a complete degenerate fermi gas of neutrons , protons and electrons for the reason that the temperature is much smaller than their fermi energies . in equilibrium state , each reaction between particles is balanced by its inverse reaction and leads to the chemical equilibrium condition @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the chemical potential of the particle-@xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the concentration of the @xmath15-species of particle with respect to the baryon number density @xmath17 such that @xmath18 is the number density of the particle-@xmath15 .",
    "therefore in equilibrium state the concentrations of the particles are not independent of each other , they are governed by the chemical equilibrium condition ( [ cheqil ] ) . in addition , total electric charge number , total baryon number @xmath19 and total lepton number of each flavor , must be conserved .",
