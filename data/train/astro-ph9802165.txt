    "comparison with n - body simulations and observations made it necessary to incorporate the effects of smoothing in the pt calculations ( goroff 1986 , juszkiewicz 1993 , bernardeau 1994a , 1994b , baugh , gaztaaga , efstathiou 1995 , gaztaaga & baugh 1995 ) .",

    "i ( fosalba & gaztaaga 1998 ) and paper ii ( gaztaaga & fosalba 1998 ) of this series it was shown that _ the spherical collapse ( sc ) model gives the exact tree - level contribution to pt irrespective of the nature of the ic and the geometry of the universe_. this means that , when it comes to computing the one - point cumulants at tree - level , only the _ spherically symmetric _ solution to the equations of motion is relevant ( see paper i  3.6 ) .",

    ". [ loclag ] making use of this property we were able to present in papers i & ii results for gaussian ( gic ) and non - gaussian ic ( ngic ) respectively , for both the unsmoothed and smoothed fields ( for a top - hat window ) . furthermore , the sc model was used to make predictions beyond the tree - level in both cases which were shown to be in good agreement with n - body simulations up to the scales where pt itself is expected to break down ( see paper i  5 and paper ii  3.3 ) .    in this paper , we derive results for the peculiar velocity field @xmath7 which is the counterpart to the density field in the newtonian equations of motion . the peculiar velocity field as traced by a population of galaxies has the potential advantage , with respect to the corresponding matter density , of being a better ( or at least different ) tracer of the corresponding underlying field .",

    "this smallness is partially due to the fact that they enter as a difference between integrals of the initial @xmath35-point functions which are generically of the same order , at least for the density field ( see paper ii , section 4.4 ) .    for the smoothed fields however ,",

    "in the previous papers ( see papers i & ii ) we assumed a spatially flat ( einstein - desitter ) universe with a vanishing cosmological constant @xmath17 , in order to derive our predictions for the one - point cumulants .",
    "although it is the simplest analytic approach and there are strong theoretical arguments which favor an @xmath54 , @xmath55 universe ( standard inflationary models ) , it remains to be seen whether or not this is actually so .    in our calculations",
    ", we have neglected the effect of a non - vanishing cosmological constant @xmath17 .",
    "however , detailed analyses have shown that the dependence of the cumulants on this parameter is extremely weak anyway , at least for a flat universe @xmath56 ( see lahav 1991 , bchj95 ) .",
    "we showed in paper i that in the general case of a perturbative approach to estimate the leading order ( tree - level ) contribution to the cumulants , it is not necessary to calculate the full kernels @xmath57 , but only the _ monopole _ contribution , @xmath58 , which corresponds to the spherically symmetric ( angle ) average .",
    "thus the values of @xmath11 can be determined by finding the spherically symmetric solution to the equations of motion .",
    "we also show that for the gravitational evolution of the density field , this solution is given by the spherical collapse ( sc ) .",
    "the proof (  4.1 in paper i ) holds irrespective of the geometry of the universe , for arbitrary @xmath3 ( which shows explicitly through the friedmann equation : @xmath59 ) .",
    "therefore , we can write the local non - linear transformation introduced in flat space ( see paper i ,  4 eq.[36 ] ) and write , = _ i=1^_n ( ) n![_l]^n , where the @xmath60 coefficients are a generalization of the flat - space monopole amplitudes , @xmath11 , to non - flat frw geometries .",

    "we present the connection between the latter and the sc equation for arbitrary @xmath3 .",
    "a good fit to the above results can be obtained by realizing that in lagrangian pt ( see  [ ap : omegadep ] ) the @xmath3-dependence of the hierarchical amplitudes only appears beyond the first perturbative contribution ( which corresponds to the za ) .",

    "secondly , the dependence with the density parameter increases with @xmath35 , so that looking at higher - order moments of the velocity divergence in the galaxy catalogues seems to be a promising test for determining @xmath3 .",
    "= 8.truecm    we stress that the behavior of the closed models is just an extrapolation of the one seen for the open models near @xmath54 , so that only small changes arise in the range @xmath120 , as compared to the case of the open models .      for both cosmic fields ( density or velocity ) the @xmath3-dependence with ngic ( for dimensional scaling , @xmath121 ) can be recovered by combining in a straightforward way the results we have presented so far .",
    "this can be done by noticing that the ngic results are given in terms of the gaussian tree - level amplitudes ( see  2.3 for the velocity and paper ii for the density ) .",
    "thus , to obtain the @xmath3-dependence one just have to substitute the gaussian tree - level amplitudes ( @xmath122 or @xmath44 ) with the corresponding @xmath3-dependent amplitudes , given above in eq.[[sjg ] ] or eq.[[tjg ] ] .",

    "for gaussian initial conditions ( gic ) , we found in paper i , that the spherical collapse ( sc ) model gives very accurate predictions for the hierarchical amplitudes @xmath68 in the perturbative regime , as compared to the results derived by scoccimarro & frieman ( 1996a , 1996b ) for the exact pt in the diagrammatic approach ( see paper i  5.1 ) . we also compared the predictions for the higher - order moments from the sc model to those measured in cdm and apm - like n - body simulations , and they turned out to be in very good agreement in all cases up to the scales where @xmath125 , supporting our view that the tidal effects only have a marginal contribution to the reduced cumulants ( see paper i  5.2 &  5.3 ) . for non - gaussian initial conditions ( ngic )",
    "the sc recovers all terms given by the exact pt for the variance , @xmath77 , skewness , @xmath97 , and kurtosis , @xmath98 , up to non - local integrals , involving initial @xmath42-point functions that arise as a result of the coupling between the asymmetric initial conditions with the tidal forces ( see paper ii  3.4 ) .",
    "the measured higher - order moments in the n - body simulations with ngic ( with dimensional , texture - like , scaling ) turned out to be in good agreement with predictions from the sc model ( see paper ii  3.3 ) , what gives further support to the domain of applicability of the sc model in pt .    in this paper , we have extended the work presented in papers i & ii and have applied the sc model in lagrangian space to study the predictions for the cumulants of the velocity divergence field , as well as the @xmath3-dependence of the one - point cumulants in pt .",
    "we provide with the results for the velocity field up to one loop ( first correction to the leading term ) . however , the loop predictions turned out not to be as accurate as those for the density field , suggesting they are dominated by tidal effects .",
    "this can be explicitly seen in the variance , see ( eqs.[[scvel]]-[[ptvel ] ] ) where the first non - linear correction to the linear contribution is only accurate within an order of magnitude with respect to the exact result for the unsmoothed field .",
    "the situation might be different for the smoothed cumulants , as we have seen ( in papers i&ii ) that for @xmath41 tidal effects seem to cancel out , at least in the case of the density .",
    "the sc loop predictions for the _ reduced _ cumulants , are in better agreement with those obtained in the exact pt as comparison with the results of scocimarro & frimean ( 1996a ) and protogeros & scherrer ( 1997 ) show .",
    "the latter suggests a cancellation of the tidal contributions in line with the behavior found for the density field .    as for the @xmath3-dependence",
    ", we showed that the sc model is the exact solution at tree - level for the one - point cumulants for arbitrary density parameter , @xmath3 ( see also  [ ap : scomega ] for a demonstration in the context of b92 ) .",
    "this property was explicitly used to derive the @xmath3-dependence of the cumulants at tree - level for the density and velocity divergence fields . as an independent check to our results we worked out the _ spherically symmetric _ solution to lagrangian pt , which was shown to be equivalent to our solution within the sc model in lagrangian space as well ( see  [ ap : omegadep ] ) .",
    "this way we were able to compare available fits to the @xmath3-dependence of the hierarchical amplitudes at tree - level in the lagrangian pt approach to our fits within the sc model approach .",
    "we found agreement within a few percent between these results as well as with the exact numerically integrated solution ( see figs .",
    "[ nftree_den ] and [ nftree_vel ] respectively ) .",
    "we also present , as a new result , the @xmath3-dependence of the one - loop corrections in the sc approximation , for gic and ngic .",
    "we show that both the variance and the @xmath68 ratios increase as @xmath3 decreases ( @xmath126 ) . for the variance with gic ,",
    "this trend is in line with fitting formulas and numerical simulations ( peacock & dodds 1996 ) and reflects the slowed - down growth of perturbations on large scales for high density frw universes .",
    "although this effect is small ( less than @xmath4 for @xmath127 ) the sc results should be accurate for @xmath41 , and could therefore be useful when compared to observations of the large scale structure in the weakly non - linear regime .",
