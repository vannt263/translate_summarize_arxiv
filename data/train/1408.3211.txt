    "understanding of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata(pmns ) matrix@xcite is now moving to another stage , due to the determination of the last angle by multi - detector observation of reactor neutrinos at daya bay@xcite and reno@xcite , whose success was strongly expected from a series of oscillation experiments , ( t2k@xcite , minos@xcite , double chooz@xcite ) , which all contributed to the forefront of neutrino physics @xcite .",
    "a number of 3@xmath4 global analyses@xcite have presented the best fit and the allowed ranges of masses and mixing parameters at 90% confidence level(cl ) by crediting reno and daya bay for the definitive measurements of @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , the best - fit values given in the analysis of fogli et al.@xcite are @xmath6 and @xmath7 for normal hierarchy .",
    "while all three mixing angles are now known to be different from zero , the values of the cp violating phases are completely unknown .",
    "although there are a number of global analysis which presented consistent values of masses and mixing parameters @xcite , we focus on @xmath0 and its associated factors obtained by reno and daya bay .    although the three - neutrino framework is well established phenomenologically , we do not rule out the existence of new kinds of neutrinos , which are inactive so - called sterile neutrinos . over the past several years , the anomalies observed in lsnd @xcite , miniboone @xcite , gallium solar neutrino experiments @xcite and some reactor experiments@xcite have been partly reconciled by the oscillations between active and sterile neutrinos . in a previous work",
    ", we also examined whether the oscillation between sterile neutrinos and active neutrinos is plausible , especially when analyzing the first results released from daya bay and reno @xcite .",
    "there are also other works with similar motivations @xcite .    after realizing the impact of the large size of @xmath0 , both reactor neutrino experiments have continued and updated the far - to - near ratios and @xmath5 .",
    "daya bay improved their measurements and explained the details of the analysis .",
    "reno announced an update with an extension until october 2012 , and modified their results as follows : the ratio of the observed to the expected number of neutrino events at the far detector @xmath8 replaced the former value of @xmath9 , and @xmath10 replaced the former best fit of @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the spectral shape was also modified .",
    "again , we examine the oscillation between a sterile neutrino and active neutrinos in order to determine whether four - neutrino oscillations are preferred to three - neutrino oscillations . this work is focused on @xmath12 within the range of @xmath13 to @xmath14 , where @xmath12 oscillations might have appeared in the superposition with @xmath15 oscillations at far detectors of @xmath16 baselines .",
    "since the mass of the fourth neutrino is unknown , it is worth verifying its existence at all available orders of magnitude which are accessible from different baseline sizes .",
    "for instance , the near detector at reno can search reactor antineutrino anomalies with @xmath17@xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section ii , the survival probability of electron antineutrinos is presented in four - neutrino oscillation scheme .",
    "we exhibit the dependence of the oscillating aspects on the order of @xmath18 , when reactor neutrinos in the energy range of 1.8 to 8 mev are detected after travel along a km - order baseline . in section iii ,",
    "the curves of the four - neutrino oscillations are compared with the spectral shape of data through october 2012 to search for any clues of sterile neutrinos and to see the changes in @xmath5 due to the coexistence with sterile neutrinos .",
    "broad ranges of @xmath18 and @xmath19 remain . in the conclusion ,",
    "the exclusion bounds of @xmath19 and the best fit of @xmath5 are summarized , and the consistency between rate - only analysis and shape analysis is discussed .",
    "the four - neutrino extension of unitary transformations from mass basis to flavor basis is given in terms of six angles and three dirac phases : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the rotation of the @xmath22 block by an angle of @xmath23 .",
    "when a 3 + 1 model is assumed as the minimal extension , the 4-by-4 @xmath24 is given by    @xmath25    where the pmns type of a 3-by-3 matrix @xmath26 with three rows , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is imbedded .",
    "the cp phases @xmath29 and @xmath30 introduced in eq.([4by4trans ] ) are omitted for simplicity , since they do not affect the electron antineutrino survival probability at the reactor neutrino oscillation .",
    "the survival probability of @xmath31 produced from reactors is @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the mass - squared difference @xmath34 .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of combined @xmath33-driven oscillations as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the size of @xmath38 relative to @xmath39 is not yet constrained .",
    "the above @xmath40 is understood only within a theoretical framework , since the energy of the detected neutrinos is not unique but is continuously distributed over a certain range .",
    "so , the observed quantity is established with a distribution of neutrino energy spectrum and an energy - dependent cross section .",
    "analyses of neutrino oscillation averages accessible energies of the neutrinos emerging from the reactors",
    ". the measured probability of survival is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total cross - section of inverse beta decay(ibd ) , and @xmath43 is the neutrino flux distribution from the reactor . the total cross section of ibd is given as @xmath44 where @xmath45@xcite .",
    "the flux distribution @xmath43 from the four isotopes @xmath46 at the reactors is expressed by the following exponential of a fifth order polynomials of @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are obtained by fitting the total flux of the four isotopes with the fission ratio expected at the middle of the reactor burn up period @xcite .",
    "the curves in fig.[fig1:distance ] show @xmath51 as @xmath52 increases in a logarithmic manner , where the three patterns of probabilities are shown according to the order of @xmath18 .",
    "the first bump in each curve corresponds to the oscillation due to @xmath18 , while the second bump that appears near @xmath53 corresponds to the oscillation due to @xmath54 .",
    "reno and daya bay were designed to observe the @xmath54-driven oscillations at far detector(fd ) according to three - neutrino analysis , while additional detector(s ) at a closer baseline perform the detection of neutrinos in the same condition .",
    "the comparison of the number of neutrino events at fd to the number of events at the near detector(nd ) is an effective strategy to determine the disappearance of antineutrinos from reactors .",
    "that is , the @xmath5 is evaluated by the slope of the curve between nd and fd , while their absolute values of event numbers do not affect the estimation of the angle @xmath0 . both experiments used the normalization to adjust the data to satisfy the boundary condition which is that there is no oscillation effect before the nd . from fig .",
    "[ fig1:distance ] , it can be shown that the magnitude of @xmath18 can affect not only the normalization factor but also the ratio between the fd and nd .",
    "the flux - weighted average baselines of the near detector(nd ) and the far detector(fd ) of reno , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are 407.3 m and 1443 m , respectively .",
    "the baselines of daya bay , named eh1 , eh2 , and eh3 , have lengths of eh1=494 m , eh2=554 m , and eh3=1628 m , respectively , so that , conventionally , eh1 and eh2 are regarded as near detectors while eh3 is regarded as a far detector .",
    "after the first release of results , daya bay and reno updated the far - to - near ratio of neutrino events with additional data .",
    "daya bay reported a ratio of @xmath57 with @xmath58@xcite .",
    "reno also reported an update with additional data from march to october in 2012 , where @xmath59@xcite .",
    "their measurements are marked in fig.[fig1:distance ] . in three - neutrino analysis ,",
    "the far - to - near ratios give the @xmath60-oscillation amplitude @xmath61 and @xmath62 in daya bay and reno , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the far - to - near ratio and the measured - to - expected ratio are understood as a combination of @xmath60 oscillations and @xmath1 oscillations as shown in fig.[fig1:distance ] . for a given value of @xmath1 , @xmath63 or @xmath63 ,",
    "the combination of @xmath19 and @xmath5 is described in fig.[fig : theta13theta14 ] . in the case of reno ,",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath65 curves which pass the error bars at nd and fd are drawn as blue(gray)-shaded areas .",
    "the area where the two shaded areas , nd and fd , overlap is the allowed region in @xmath66 space using rate - only analysis .",
    "the corresponding analysis for daya bay is shown together in fig.[fig : theta13theta14 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is in good agreement with the results released by the two experiments .",
    "one of reno s results was the ratio of the observed to the expected number of antineutrinos in the far detector , @xmath67 ( see ref.@xcite ) , where the observed is simply the number of events at fd .",
    "on the other hand , the expected number of events at fd can be obtained using several adjustments of the number of events at nd : @xmath68}{[\\mathrm{expected ~at ~fd } ] } \\label{obs2exp}\\\\       & \\equiv & \\frac{[\\mathrm{no .",
    "~of ~events ~at ~fd}]}{[\\mathrm{no .",
    "~of ~events ~at ~nd}]^ * } ~ , \\label{far_to_near }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the number of events at each detector is normalized .",
    "the normalization of the neutrino fluxes at nd and fd requires an adjustment between the two individual detectors which includes corrections due to daq live time , detection efficiency , background rate , and the distance to each detector .",
    "the numbers of events at fd and nd in eq.([far_to_near ] ) have already been normalized by these correction factors , and so we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 as shown in fig.[fig : theta13theta14 ] .",
    "the normalization guarantees @xmath71 at the center of the reactors .",
    "reno removes the oscillation effect at nd when evaluating the expected number of events at fd by dividing the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ far_to_near ] ) by 0.990 which is taken from @xmath72 .",
    "now , @xmath73}{[\\mathrm{no .",
    "~of ~events ~at ~nd } ] ~/~0.990 } ~ , \\label{jungsik }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in rate - only analysis , the ratio of the observed to the expected number of events at fd in eq.([obs2exp ] ) is just the survival at fd , since the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ jungsik ] ) is eliminated .",
    "thus , @xmath74 coincides with @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta13theta14 ] .    in spectral shape analysis ,",
    "however , the denominator can not be neglected , since the oscillation effect at nd differs depending on the neutrino energy .",
    "the data points in fig.[fig : shape_analysis ] are obtained by the definition of the ratio @xmath74 given in eq .",
    "( [ obs2exp ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ far_to_near ] ) per 0.25mev bin , as the energy varies from 1.8mev to 12.8mev .",
    "the data dots and error bars were updated by including additional data from march to october in 2012 officially announced at neutrino telescope 2013@xcite .",
    "the ratio in eq.([jungsik ] ) is compared with theoretical curves overlaid on the data points .",
    "the theoretical curves are described by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is given in eq.([pee ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3exclusion ] , the best fit of @xmath78 is presented when @xmath79 .",
    "the point @xmath80 indicates the @xmath81 minimum where @xmath5 and @xmath54 are parameters , while the point @xmath82 is the minimum where @xmath54 is 0.00232 which reno and daya bay used for the fixed value .",
    "hereafter , two cases depending on @xmath54 are discussed : one is for @xmath83 marked by * a * and the other is for @xmath84 marked by * b*. according to the analysis performed with @xmath79 , the red curves for the two values of @xmath85 are overlaid on the spectral data in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_analysis ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion ] shows interpretation of the spectral shape in terms of four - neutrino oscillation . for given values of @xmath85 and @xmath5 , the 1 , 2 ,",
    "3@xmath86 cl exclusion curves are obtained by convolution with the energy resolution of reno detectors @xmath87 . using the best fits @xmath88 for * ( a ) * and @xmath89 for * ( b ) * , the blue curves are also added on the spectral data in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_analysis ] . to see a distinct different aspect due to the magnitude of @xmath18",
    ", we choose @xmath90 for the best fit of * ( b ) * , avoiding @xmath91 which is the same as the @xmath92 for * ( a)*.    the solid curves in fig.[fig : chi_sq ] explain @xmath93 and @xmath94 cl of @xmath95 in parameters @xmath96 , of which the best - fits are found at ( 0.092 , 0.049 ) for case * ( a ) * of @xmath97 and at ( 0.118 , 0.054 ) for case * ( b ) * of @xmath98 . in case * ( b ) * where the value of @xmath60 is the same as the one that reno and daya bay took for it , the best fit of @xmath99 is 0.118 in company with non - zero @xmath100 .",
    "the best fit @xmath101 with the restriction @xmath102 is still within @xmath3 region of four - neutrino analysis .",
    "also in case * ( b ) * which is specified by a rather large @xmath60 compared to the value taken by reno and daya bay or the value suggested by global analyses , the best fit @xmath103 of three - neutrino analysis is placed in the region of @xmath3 cl .",
    "this implies no preference between three - neutrino and four - neutrino schemes when the shape in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_analysis ] is analyzed in this rough estimation .",
    "if a fourth type of neutrino has a mass not much larger than the other three masses , the results of reactor neutrino oscillations like reno , daya bay , and double chooz can be affected by the fourth state . for detectors established for oscillations driven by @xmath84",
    ", clues about the fourth neutrino can be perceived only if the order of @xmath18 is not much larger than that of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , this work examined the possibility of a kind of sterile neutrino in the range of mass - squared differences below @xmath104 , considering the two announced results of reno and daya bay . anomalies of reactor antineutrino oscillations have been considered for the range , @xmath105 .",
    "thus , it is worth analyzing the absolute flux at the near detector and the ratio of the far - to - near flux on a common basis@xcite .",
    "reno announced an update of rate - only analysis and the spectral shape of neutrino events[neutrino telescope ] , including an observed - to - expected ratio @xmath8 and an oscillation amplitude of @xmath10 .",
    "we compared the spectral shape with theoretical curves of the superpositions of @xmath18 oscillations and @xmath54 oscillations . in summary ,",
    "@xmath106 is excluded at @xmath94 cl .",
    "when @xmath84 is fixed , the best - fit in four - neutrino parameters is @xmath107 .",
    "when we search the fit of @xmath54 along with other parameters of four - neutrino analysis , the best value is obtained @xmath83 with @xmath103 from the shape in three - neutrino analysis . when the parameters are extended to four - neutrino scheme ,",
    "the best fit is @xmath108 . as shown in fig.[fig : chi_sq ] , the three - neutrino analysis of reno @xmath109 is also included within @xmath3 cl in four - neutrino analysis .",
    "thus , it is not yet known whether the superposition with @xmath18 oscillations is preferred to the single @xmath54 oscillations at reno detectors .",
