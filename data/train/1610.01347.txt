    "the discovery and a subsequent precision measurement of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have provided us with precious information on the evolution of our universe , and helped us to establish the standard model of cosmology  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , only an indirect evidence for the existence of cosmic neutrino background ( c@xmath12b ) has been found in the observations of cmb , primordial abundances of light nuclear elements and cosmic large - scale structures , where neutrinos have played a crucially important role  @xcite .",
    "the direct detection of c@xmath12b in the future will be another great triumph of the standard cosmology , and also offer a new possibility to probe the intrinsic properties of massive neutrinos .    according to the standard cosmology ,",
    "the temperature of c@xmath12b at present is extremely low , namely , @xmath13 , and the corresponding average momentum is @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "consequently , it will be an extremely difficult task to detect c@xmath12b , although the number density for each neutrino or antineutrino species can be as large as @xmath15 .",
    "as was pointed out by weinberg in 1962  @xcite , cosmic relic neutrinos can be captured on beta - decaying nuclei , such as @xmath0 , which can take place without an energy threshold for the initial - state neutrinos . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was noticed that the signal of the capture of c@xmath12b will be a peak in the final - state electron spectrum , which is located at a distance of @xmath16 away from the end point of beta - decay spectrum of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , in order to observe this tiny separation , we need an energy resolution even smaller than the absolute neutrino mass @xmath18 , which is now known to be at or below the sub - ev level .",
    "recently , a lot of attention has been paid to the detection of c@xmath12b through the capture on beta - decaying nuclei .",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , for reviews on the other possible approaches . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed calculation of the capture rate for @xmath0 was first performed , and the impact of neutrino mass hierarchies and flavor mixing on the capture rate was investigated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , similar processes for the ev- and kev - mass sterile neutrinos or for different nuclear isotopes have also been discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the ptolemy experiment has been proposed  @xcite , in which a 100 gram of surface - deposition tritium source will be implemented and the energy resolution for the final - state electrons can reach @xmath19 .",
    "given this nominal experimental setup , long _",
    "et al . _ and lisanti _ et al . _ have found that the capture rate is @xmath1 if massive neutrinos are dirac particles , while that for majorana neutrinos is twice larger , i.e. , @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "although the capture rate is small , it is already interesting to have a realistic experiment that will be able to directly prove the existence of c@xmath12b .",
    "moreover , the difference between the capture rates @xmath21 and @xmath22 will enable us to discriminate dirac and majorana nature of massive neutrinos .",
    "such a discrimination is extremely important for exploring the origin of neutrino masses .    motivated by the proposed ptolemy experiment , the authors of refs .",

    "an immediate question arises : is it possible to distinguish between thermal and nonthermal energy spectra of relic right - handed neutrinos ?",
    "the main purpose of this short note is to answer this question , and show that a ptolemy - like experiment with a total statistics of @xmath23 neutrino events may do such a challenging job .",
    "the remaining part of this work is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review possible ways to generate right - handed neutrinos in the early universe and the impact of thermal and nonthermal spectra of relic right - handed neutrinos on the detection of c@xmath12b . following the general idea of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the gravitational focusing effects by the sun are considered , we demonstrate in section 3 that the annual modulation of the capture rate can be used to discriminate the velocity distributions of cosmic relic neutrinos .",
    "finally , we give some concluding remarks in section 4 .",
    "if the standard model of elementary particles ( sm ) is extended with three right - handed neutrinos , which are singlets under the sm gauge symmetries , neutrinos acquire tiny dirac masses in the same way as charged leptons and quarks do .",

    ", the neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field . in order to obtain sub - ev neutrino masses",
    "@xmath36 , we have to require extremely small yukawa couplings @xmath37 , which exaggerates the hierarchy problem of fermion yukawa couplings , when compared to the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath38 .",

    "however , we focus on the cosmological implications of massive dirac neutrinos . a satisfactory solution to these two theoretical problems",
    "is beyond the scope of this work .    within the sm and standard cosmology",
    ", the production rate of right - handed neutrinos in the early universe is always far below the hubble expansion rate at any time  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is quite reasonable to ignore right - handed neutrinos @xmath40 and left - handed antineutrinos @xmath41 for @xmath42 in the evolution of our universe .",
    "nowadays , we have only left - handed neutrinos @xmath43 and right - handed antineutrinos @xmath44 as a cosmic background , for which the average number density is @xmath15 .",
    "when new physics scenarios are considered , it is possible to produce both @xmath40 and @xmath41 abundantly and reconcile them with cosmological observations , in particular the effective number of neutrino species @xmath45 from the latest data of big bang nucleosynthesis and cmb .",
    "generally speaking , there exist two typical scenarios .    *",
    "_ thermal right - handed dirac neutrinos_as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , if primordial magnetic fields are generated in the electroweak phase transition  @xcite , even a rather small magnetic dipole moment of massive dirac neutrinos @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 being the bohr magneton and @xmath48 ) leads to a thermal production of @xmath40 via significant @xmath49 conversions  @xcite . depending on the evolution of primordial magnetic fields , the decoupling temperature of @xmath50",

    "the average number density of @xmath40 or @xmath41 turns out to be @xmath60 , which should be compared with @xmath61 in the standard case .",

    "@xcite , it has been argued that the coupling of right - handed neutrinos to the inflaton field could give rise to a nonthermal production of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the reheating epoch after inflation . in this nonthermal ( nt ) scenario , both @xmath40 and @xmath41 have never been in thermal equilibrium , the distribution function in the c@xmath12b frame can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the fermi energy at present . here",
    "@xmath65 is the fraction of occupied states below the fermi energy , and @xmath66 corresponds to the case of a degenerate spectrum . without specifying any dynamics of particle production from inflaton decays , the authors of ref .",

    "hence , cosmic relic neutrinos are nowadays non - relativistic particles .",
    "the distribution functions in the phase space for both th and nt right - handed dirac neutrinos are shown in fig .  1 , where one can observe the main difference between these two types of spectra",

    "the production of right - handed neutrinos @xmath40 in the early universe is so inefficient that all the neutrino states are left - handed in chirality . in the epoch of neutrino decoupling , neutrinos are relativistic particles , so almost all of them are left - helical states . as the helicity is conserved during the expansion of our universe , we have the number density of left - helical neutrino states @xmath103 nowadays , where all the neutrino mass eigenstates are assumed to be equally populated . meanwhile , the number density of right - helical neutrino states is vanishingly small , i.e. , @xmath104 .",
    "following the same arguments , we arrive at @xmath105 and @xmath106 for antineutrinos .",
    "since @xmath107 is independent of neutrino velocities in the leading - order approximation for non - relativistic neutrinos ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) , the integration over distribution functions just gives the neutrino number density . with the help of the unitarity condition of lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath109 ,",

    "is completely cancelled out  @xcite . ]",
    "although such corrections to the total rate are insignificant , we include them for completeness .",
    "second , the impact of the sun s gravity on the dark matter distribution has already been investigated in refs .  @xcite . as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , even if the relic neutrinos are unbound to the milky way , the gravity of the sun will modify the velocity distribution of c@xmath12b at the earth , where the detectors are located . in this work ,",
    "we take the absolute neutrino mass to be @xmath78 , so the gravitational clustering of neutrinos in the dark matter halo of the galactic scale can be neglected  @xcite .",
    "if the absolute neutrino masses are much larger , the clustering effects are important and should be taken into account . for later convenience ,",
    "we rewrite the distribution function of non - relativistic relic neutrinos as @xmath117 where @xmath118 holds as an excellent approximation and @xmath119 is the velocity distribution function in the c@xmath12b frame . in order to derive the distribution function of relic neutrinos relative to the earth , which will be denoted as @xmath120",
    ", we have to know the velocity of the earth @xmath121 relative to the sun .",

    "the velocity of the sun relative to the c@xmath12b frame is approximately given by @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "the velocity @xmath130 can be identified from the dipole structure of cmb  @xcite if we approximately identify the cmb frame with c@xmath12b frame , which is quite reasonable as no significant clustering of neutrinos takes place in the epoch of cmb formation  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the minimal neutrino density in the standard case is reached around @xmath140 ( namely , march 12 ) when the earth is most upwind , while the maximum is achieved half a year later , i.e. , on september 11 .    , and the case of nonthermal ( nt ) right - handed dirac neutrinos ( red dashed curve ) with @xmath77.,width=288 ]",
    "now we can insert the distribution function @xmath141 for relic neutrinos in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diste ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dist ] ) into the total capture rate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : totrate ] ) , and derive the rates at an arbitrary time during the year both in the standard scenario and in two nonstandard scenarios with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the final results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : totrate ] , where all the total capture rates have been normalized to the minimal rate on march 12 in the standard case .",
    "since @xmath107 is almost velocity - independent , the normalized capture rates directly reflect the local neutrino number densities along the orbit of the earth .",
    "two main differences between standard and nonstandard cases can be observed .",
    "first , the relic right - handed neutrinos in th and nt scenarios contribute to the capture rate by a sizable amount of @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively .",
    "second , the difference between maximum and minimum increases remarkably in the two nonstandard cases , where right - handed neutrinos concentrate more on the region of low velocities and thus they are affected greatly by the sun s gravity .      to make a detailed comparison , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and define the annual modulation as @xmath144 where @xmath145 stands for the time of minimal capture rate . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] , the annual modulation has been calculated for both standard and nonstandard scenarios . on the left panel ,",
    "the modulation for the standard c@xmath12b is plotted as a magenta dotted curve , from which one can read the maximum is only about @xmath146 ( see also the same curve zoomed in on the right panel ) . in the th case , the thick and thin dashed curves in blue correspond to the modulations for the temperature of @xmath147 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "similar results for the nt case for @xmath148 and @xmath77 are denoted by thick and thin solid curves in red . on the right panel , the combined contributions from both left - handed and right - handed neutrinos to the modulation have been depicted .",
    "some comments are in order :    * one can observe from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] that the peak modulation can be as large as @xmath149 in the th case for @xmath147 and in the nt case for @xmath148 , which should be compared to @xmath150 in the standard case . for the other model parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 , for which the number density of right - handed neutrinos saturates the cosmological upper bound on @xmath151 , the maximal modulations in both th and nt will be reduced by a factor of twenty .",
    "this observation demonstrates that the impact of the sun s gravity on the local density of relic neutrinos is more important for slower neutrinos . * in both th and nt scenarios ,",
    "the modulation should receive the contributions from both left - handed neutrinos ( i.e. , the standard c@xmath12b ) and right - handed neutrinos .",
    "therefore , only the curves on the right panel correspond to realistic situations . on the left panel ,",
    "the modulations solely from right - handed neutrinos are given to illustrate their main differences from the result in the standard case .",
    "although the amplitude of annual modulation due to right - handed neutrinos is larger for a lower temperature or fermi energy , their number density will be smaller , leading to a reduced capture rate .",
    "this is why the peak modulations for different model parameters ( namely , @xmath56 for th and @xmath64 for nt ) on the right panel are now comparable .    finally , we consider if it is possible to distinguish between th and nt scenarios , assuming the number density of right - handed neutrinos to be the same .",
    "this consideration does make sense , since the total capture rates will be distinguishable if the number densities of right - handed neutrinos are different .",
    "hence , in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] , we show the maximal modulation for a given number density @xmath152 of right - handed neutrinos , which has been normalized to the present - day number density of cmb photons @xmath153 . in either th or nt scenario , once a value of @xmath56 or @xmath64 is assumed , one can immediately calculate the corresponding number density @xmath152 and the total capture rate , which are actually displayed on the bottom and top axes . some important observations related to fig .  [ fig : density ] should be emphasized :    1 .   for an extremely small number density @xmath152 , the contribution of right - handed neutrinos to the total capture rate is negligible , as is shown on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] .",
    "therefore , the modulation for nt ( blue solid curve ) and that for th ( red dashed curve ) are approaching @xmath5 from right , which is the limiting value in the standard case . to the right of the vertical dashed line around @xmath154 , it is evident that the modulations for th and nt scenarios are clearly distinguishable .",
    "it should be noted that the slowly - moving neutrino wind does not imply a large modulation for extremely low neutrino velocities .",
    "the main reason can be understood as follows . in the heliocentric ecliptic coordinate system",
    ", the wind of c@xmath12b is moving towards the solar system in an inclined angle about @xmath155 or @xmath156 , which indicates that the focus point through the solar gravitational lens does not exactly match the maximum point of modulation .",
    "because of the dispersion of neutrino velocities , the focus of neutrino wind is broadened to cover the maximum point of modulation .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that this can be achieved if the neutrino velocity increases to @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , if neutrino velocities are too low , the focus region is far from the orbit of the earth , implying a small modulation .",
    "3 .   on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] , one may notice that there exists a maximum of the modulation for varying number densities @xmath152 in either nt or th scenario .",
    "the reason is the same as above .",
    "the average velocity at the maximum point is @xmath158 for the nt case , while @xmath159 for the th case , which is very close to @xmath160 that we have found before . after these maximum points",
    ", the modulation decreases due to the fact that the neutrino wind is less deflected for increasing velocities .",
    "the two vertical lines on the right part arise from the cosmological bound on @xmath151 , constraining the number density of right - handed neutrinos from above . on the right panel , however , those maxima are no longer visible , which can be understood by the relatively small number density of relic right - handed neutrinos at the maximum compared to that of left - handed neutrinos .",
    "note that new maxima indeed arise from the superposition of the contributions from both left - handed and right - handed neutrinos and are located at different number densities .",
    "it is now clear that the maximal modulation in the nonstandard scenarios ranges from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , which is twice or three times larger than @xmath5 in the standard case . in order to observe such an effect",
    ", we need to implement a ptolemy - like experiment with a much larger target mass and run it for a long time . in accumulating the data",
    ", we should also notice that the incoming direction of the neutrino wind is changing , leading to a drift of the maximum point of modulation at about @xmath161 per 20 years  @xcite .",
    "the recently proposed ptolemy experiment will be able to detect relic neutrinos from the big bang via @xmath0 by using a 100 gram of surface - deposition tritium source and an excellent energy resolution of @xmath162  @xcite . assuming that massive neutrinos are dirac particles , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite have found that the capture rate of cosmic relic neutrinos can be enhanced from @xmath1 in the standard case to be @xmath2 and @xmath3 , if right - handed neutrinos can be produced thermally and nonthermally in the early universe . in this short note ,",
    "following the idea of annual modulation induced by the sun s gravity in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have pointed out that it is possible to distinguish between thermal and nonthermal spectra of cosmic relic neutrinos .    in the optimistic case , where the cosmological bound on the extra neutrino species @xmath69 is saturated",
    ", the modulation of the c@xmath12b capture rate reaches its maximum @xmath163 or @xmath164 on september 11 for the nt and th scenario , respectively .",
    "this is to be compared with the maximal modulation @xmath5 in the standard case for the absolute neutrino mass scale @xmath78 .",
    "the choice of this absolute mass is marginally compatible with the cosmological bound on the sum of three neutrino masses @xmath165 . for a larger neutrino mass , the amplitude of modulation will be increased and the gravitational clustering effects will enhance the local number density of cosmic relic neutrinos . in this case , however , neutrinos will be a mixture of unbound and bound components , implying an even smaller difference between nt and th spectra , as the bound relic neutrinos should follow the same distribution in the phase space .",
    "therefore , a relatively large neutrino mass is not always helpful .    as a rough estimate , we have to accumulate more than @xmath23 events in a ptolemy - like experiment to see an annual modulation of @xmath6 at the @xmath166 level  @xcite .",
    "such a detection might not be impossible in the future when the ptolemy experiment is successful in discovering cosmic relic neutrinos and then scaled up to a @xmath167 target mass or more .",
    "furthermore , the general idea presented in this note is to discriminate thermal and nonthermal energy spectra of cosmic relic particles via the annual modulation of detection rates .",
