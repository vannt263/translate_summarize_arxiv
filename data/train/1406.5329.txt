    "thermoelectric effects have generated an immense interest for quite some time already because they offer the possibility to convert heat from the environment into electrical work  @xcite .",
    "this form of energy harvesting is potentially useful for electric circuits on modern computer chips that produce large amounts of heat and currently need to be cooled actively in order not to overheat .",
    "one can also use the harvested energy to run auxiliary circuits such as autonomous sensors or recycle the lost energy to charge a battery .",
    "unfortunately , even after decades of material research current thermoelectric materials still have a very low efficiency in converting heat into electrical work and deliver only moderate powers .",
    "for this reason , thermoelectric energy harvesting so far is restricted to certain niche applications such as in interplanetary spaceships where the fact that a thermoelectric generator does not require any moving parts and therefore no maintenance turns out to be useful .",
    "we give a brief summary of how conventional thermoelectric devices work to orient the reader .",
    "the building blocks of thermoelectricity are the peltier and seebeck effect .",
    "the seebeck effect is the flow of electrical current in response to an applied temperature difference , while the peltier effect is the reverse : the creation of temperature difference in response to an applied electrical voltage .",
    "this is intuitively understood by the fact that the hotter charge carriers diffuse faster than the cold ones , creating a flow of thermal energy from hot to cold , and consequently the imbalanced charge builds up an electrical voltage across the material .",
    "one challenge in making good thermoelectric devices is that materials that are good electrical conductors tend also to be good thermal conductors .",
    "this fact makes it difficult to maintain the necessary temperature difference needed to produce electrical power from the seebeck effect .",
    "the need for ways to create systems with high electrical conductance , while maintaining low thermal conductance is an outstanding challenge in this field that the interface - based devices we shall describe can help to solve .",
    "commercial devices use doped semiconductors such as bismuth telluride . in an n - type semiconductor ,",
    "heat flow is in the same direction of the electron ( current ) flow , however , in a p - type semiconductor , heat and current flows are in opposite directions .",
    "this is useful because a thermoelectric architecture can be built of alternating p - type and n - type semiconductor elements that are connected electrically in series ( via metallic contacts ) and thermally in parallel .",
    "this permits the small electrical voltage ( or power ) produced by a single element to be increased by the number of elements in the device , making a practically useful system .",
    "these are placed between ceramics plates which conduct heat , but not electricity , so one side can be heated and the other cooled to produce the power .",
    "alternatively , power can be applied to cool the cold side , and heat the hot one , acting as a refrigerator .",
    "mesoscopic solid - state physics can help to overcome the limitations of current thermoelectric materials by providing powerful and highly efficient heat engines operating at the nanoscale .",
    "soon after initial studies on the thermopower of basic mesoscopic structures like quantum point contacts  @xcite and quantum dots  @xcite , there were first proposals pointing out that structures of reduced dimension can give rise to an increased thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath0 as compared to bulk structures made from the same materials  @xcite .",
    "similar ideas where brought forward by mahan and sofo  @xcite who showed that sharp spectral features give rise to high thermoelectric performance as characterized by a high value of @xmath0 .",
    "nanoscale conductors such as quantum dots naturally provide these sharp spectral features .",
    "hence , they are promising candidates for thermoelectric energy harvesters",
    ".    initial experiments on quantum dots defined in a two - dimensional electron gas showed saw - toothlike oscillations of the thermopower as a function of gate voltage in agreement with theory  @xcite .",
    "further studies have been carried out on open quantum dots  @xcite and carbon nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the thermopower of quantum dots defined in nanowires has been studied  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these experiments could observe nonlinear thermoelectric effects  @xcite . in another series of experiments the thermopower due to sequential tunneling , cotunneling and",
    "the kondo effect has been investigated in gate - defined quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "the thermopower of double dots was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "two - terminal geometries using mesoscopic conductors have been considered , notably using quantum dots  @xcite . in the two - terminal geometry ,",
    "both temperature and voltage bias are applied to the sample and the thermoelectric response is investigated .",
    "it has the advantage of being the analogue of the traditional thermocouple which has wide applications , mainly in its role as a thermometer .",
    "however , for the purpose of energy harvesting , it suffers from the fact that different parts of the same electrical circuit must be at different temperatures which makes thermal isolation difficult .",
    "sketch of a generic thermoelectric energy harvester : a mesoscopic system situated at the interface between a cold and a hot bath converts a heat current @xmath1 into a charge current @xmath2 that is able to power a load or charge a battery . ]",
    "in contrast to the above mentioned works based on two - terminal configurations , the problem of a device that powers a circuit by harvesting energy from the outside environment demands a three - terminal geometry , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : harvest ] .",
    "two terminals at the same temperature define the conductor that supports a charge current @xmath2 .",
    "the third terminal represents the coupling to the heat source from which energy but not charge is absorbed .",
    "the harvester converts the heat current @xmath1 into useful power , @xmath3 , that runs a load resistance , represented here by a voltage drop @xmath4 opposed to the generated current .",
    "the properties of the mesoscopic region to which the three terminals are connected define the characteristics of the heat engine , in particular its efficiency , @xmath5 .",
    "only recently has the investigation of thermoelectric effects in quantum - dot structures in three - terminal geometries generated a lot of attention  @xcite .",
    "this was motivated by a number of reasons .",
    "first of all , such three - terminal setups share a number of features with mesoscopic coulomb - drag setups that have been studied both theoretically  @xcite as well as experimentally  @xcite in the last years .",
    "such coulomb - drag setups consist of two nearby mesoscopic conductors such as quantum dots .",
    "the first conductor is subject to a bias voltage that drives a charge current through it .",
    "nonequilibrium charge fluctuations ( noise ) due to this current will induce charge fluctuations in the second , unbiased conductor . if the second conductor is intrinsically nonlinear it will rectify these induced charge fluctuations and thus exhibit a charge current without an applied bias voltage",
    ". similarly , in a three - terminal heat engine , thermal fluctuations from the hot source can get rectified and drive a directed charge current . here",
    ", the nonequilibrium situation is introduced by the temperature imbalance between the hot source and the conductor .",
    "in addition , three - terminal heat engines offer the advantage of spatially separating the hot and cold reservoirs , cf . .",
    "this becomes most pronounced in a recently proposed microwave - cavity heat engine where two mesoscopic conductors such as double quantum dots are connected via a superconducting microwave cavity over a typical length of a few centimeters  @xcite .",
    "the separation of hot and cold baths helps to reduce leakage heat currents that are detrimental to achieving a high efficiency of heat to work conversion .",
    "finally , three - terminal heat engines also exhibit a crossed flow of heat and charge currents .",
    "this is useful for energy harvesting applications because it allows the hot source to be kept electrically separated from the actual energy harvester .",
    "thermoelectric configurations including thermometer terminals have also been investigated  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to bulk thermoelectric materials , nanoscale heat engines often operate in the nonlinear regime .",
    "linear response theory is valid if the temperature difference on the scale of the inelastic scattering length is small compared to the average temperature  @xcite . for bulk materials , the inelastic scattering length is typically much smaller than the system size , such that even for a sizable temperature bias , linear response theory is a good approximation . for nanoscale setups , system size and",
    "inelastic scattering length become comparable .",
    "hence , nonlinear effects become important  @xcite . in order to properly describe nonlinear thermoelectric effects in mesoscopic structures , a nonlinear scattering matrix theory of thermoelectric transport",
    "has been developed recently  @xcite .",
    "it has been applied to study heat transport through quantum dots where , e.g. , a deviation from the wiedeman - franz law was found  @xcite .",
    "it was also used to investigate the magnetic - field asymmetry of nonlinear transport coefficients  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the nonlocal thermoelectric response of a ballistic four - terminal structure has been investigated  @xcite .",
    "further studies theoretically analyzed nonlinear thermoelectric transport through molecular junctions  @xcite . an important feature of nonlinear thermoelectrics is that the figure of merit @xmath0 is no longer sufficient to characterize the thermoelectric performance  @xcite .",
    "instead , one has to rely on quantities such as the maximal efficiency , the efficiency at maximum power  @xcite or the maximal efficiency at a given output power  @xcite .    here",
    ", we review recent theoretical work on three - terminal thermoelectrics with quantum dots .",
    "the review is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : coulomb ] we discuss systems of coulomb - coupled conductors ranging from quantum dots in the coulomb - blockade regime over chaotic cavities to resonant tunneling quantum dots . the second part , sec .",
    "[ sec : boson ] , focusses on quantum dot heat engines that are driven by bosonic degrees of freedom such as phonons , magnons and microwave photons .",
    "we finish with conclusions and an outlook in sec .  [",
    "sec : concl ] .",
    "in the following , we discuss different types of heat engines based on quantum dots that are coupled to a hot electronic reservoir . as a first example",
    ", we will analyze a setup based on capacitively coupled quantum dots in the coulomb - blockade regime .",
    "we then continue the discussion with a similar system based on chaotic cavities coupled to reservoirs via quantum point contacts with a large number of open transport channels .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that heat engines based on resonant tunneling through either quantum dots or quantum wells can yield high power in combination with good efficiency .      here",
    ", we analyze the thermoelectric properties of two capacitively coupled quantum dots in the coulomb - blockade regime in a three - terminal geometry  @xcite .",
    "this model emphasizes the contribution of charge fluctuations , with heat being absorbed merely by means of the coulomb interaction between electrons in the two different conductors .",
    "we demonstrate how a temperature bias across the system can drive a charge current which in turn can be used to generate electrical power .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the device can act as an ideal heat to current converter that can reach carnot efficiency .",
    "the bipartite nature of this setup can be exploited for other purposes such as feedback control  @xcite , the detection of dynamical rates  @xcite or the investigation of information flows  @xcite .",
    "sketch of the coulomb - blockade heat engine .",
    "two single - level quantum dots ( yellow ) are capacitively coupled to each other . the lower gate quantum dot is connected to a single hot reservoir ( red ) .",
    "the upper conductor dot is coupled to two cold electronic reservoirs ( blue ) . ]",
    "we consider the setup shown schematically in .",
    "it consists of two quantum dots @xmath6 in the coulomb - blockade regime .",
    "each dot hosts a single level with energy @xmath7 .",
    "assuming strong onsite coulomb interaction , the dots can host either @xmath8 or @xmath9 excess electron . in the following",
    ", we neglect the electron spin as it will only lead to a renormalization of the tunnel couplings introduced below .",
    "the two quantum dots are capacitively coupled to each other such that they can exchange energy but no particles . the strength of the coupling is characterized by the coulomb energy @xmath10 that is needed to occupy both quantum dots at the same time and will parametrize the energy exchange between the two dots .",
    "the conductor dot , @xmath11 , is tunnel coupled to two electronic reservoirs @xmath12 .",
    "the reservoirs are in local thermal equilibrium and characterized by chemical potentials @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the gate dot , @xmath15 , is coupled to a single reservoir @xmath16 with chemical potential @xmath17 and temperature @xmath18 . in order to obtain a finite thermoelectric response through the conductor dot to a temperature difference @xmath19 , we need to have energy - dependent tunnel coupling strengths . here , we model this energy dependence by choosing the tunnel couplings @xmath20 between the dot and its respective reservoir @xmath21 to depend on the number of electrons , @xmath22 , on the _ other _ quantum dot .",
    "there are different ways how to realize this energy dependence in an actual experiment .",
    "first of all , the transmission through a tunnel barrier generically depends on energy of the tunneling particle .",
    "this effect is most pronounced for energies close to the barrier height .",
    "second , quantum dots with an excited state that couples asymmetrically to the two leads and decays quickly into the ground state can mimic energy - dependent tunneling rates as well .",
    "finally , additional quantum dots can be added between the conductor dot and its two reservoirs .",
    "these additional dots serve as energy filters that only transmit electrons at a given energy and thereby allow to achieve an effectively energy - dependent tunnel coupling .    in order to describe the system , we trace out the noninteracting electronic reservoirs .",
    "the remaining strongly interacting quantum dot degrees of freedom are then characterized by a reduced density matrix for the double quantum dot .",
    "the time evolution of the system is determined by a master equation @xmath23 for the reduced density matrix elements @xmath24 describing the probability to find the double dot empty @xmath25 , occupied with one electron on the conductor @xmath26 or gate dot @xmath27 and doubly occupied @xmath28 . in the sequential tunneling regime",
    "@xmath29 the transition rates @xmath30 follow from fermi s golden rule and are given by @xmath31 the transition rates @xmath32 describe tunneling of electrons onto or off the dot through barrier @xmath33 when the other dot has @xmath22 electrons .",
    "specifically , they are written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 + 1\\}^{-1}$ ] denotes the fermi function with temperature @xmath36 and bias voltage @xmath37 .    in order to calculate the charge and heat currents as well as their fluctuations and correlations",
    ", we use a full - counting statistics approach . to this end",
    ", we multiply the transition rates with a factor @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the charge transferred through barrier @xmath33 in the associated tunneling event . the cumulant generating function @xmath40 is then given by the eigenvalue of the resulting matrix @xmath41 that goes to zero as @xmath42 .",
    "the charge currents are simply given by the derivative of the cumulant generating function with respect to the counting fields , @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , for the energy currents , we introduce counting factors @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the energy transferred through barrier @xmath33 in the corresponding tunneling event .",
    "higher - order derivatives give the correlations that will be discussed in section  [ sec : cbfluct ] .",
    "finally , heat currents follow from charge and energy currents as @xmath46 .",
    "we remark that while charge and energy currents are conserved , @xmath47 , heat currents in general are not conserved due to joule heating .",
    "current at zero bias voltage in units of @xmath48 as a function of the two level positions @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "parameters are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . ]    in the following , we want to drive a charge current through the conductor dot simply by applying a temperature difference between the reservoirs of conductor and gate dot , i.e. without applying a bias voltage across the conductor dot . in order to achieve this goal",
    ", two requirements have to be met .",
    "first of all , the left - right symmetry of the system has to be broken .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing the tunnel couplings of the conductor dot to the left and right reservoirs different .",
    "in addition , we also have to break the particle - hole symmetry underlying the system .",
    "this is achieved by having energy - dependent tunneling rates for the conductor dot .    in the absence of a bias voltage",
    ", the charge current @xmath2 through the conductor dot can be simply related to the heat current @xmath1 flowing out of the gate dot ,  @xcite @xmath55 the ratio of heat and charge currents is determined by the ratio of electron charge and charging energy .",
    "furthermore , it depends on the ratio of the different tunnel couplings that enter the problem .",
    "the direction of the charge current can be controlled via the asymmetry of tunnel couplings as well as by the direction of the heat current , i.e. by the sign of the temperature bias @xmath19 .",
    "the largest current , @xmath56 , can be achieved in an optimal configuration when the conductor dot couples only to , say , the left lead when the gate dot is empty and only to the right lead , when the gate dot is occupied .",
    "the heat - driven current as a function of the level positions of the two dots is shown in . as a function of the gate dot level , @xmath50 ,",
    "the current exhibits a peak at @xmath57 with a width given by the temperature of the hot bath , @xmath18 . as a function of the conductor dot level , @xmath49",
    ", the current has a plateau between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the borders of the plateau are smeared by the temperature of the cold bath , @xmath18 .",
    "the mechanism giving rise to the heat - driven charge current is the following .",
    "initially , the double dot is completely empty . in a first step , an electron tunnels onto the conductor dot from , say , the left reservoir .",
    "next , an electron tunnels onto the gate dot .",
    "this requires the charging energy @xmath10 which is extracted from the hot reservoir .",
    "afterwards , the electron from the conductor dot tunnels into the right lead , thereby releasing the charging energy into the cold reservoir . in a final step ,",
    "the gate dot is emptied such that the system returns to its initial state .",
    "in one such transport cycle , one quantum of energy , i.e. the charging energy , is transferred from the hot to the cold , giving rise to correlations of the charge and heat currents .",
    "we remark that , in the optimal configuration , one electron is transmitted from the left to the right reservoir for _ every _ absorbed quantum of heat .",
    "this is known as the tight - coupling limit .",
    "( a ) power @xmath60 ( solid lines ) and efficiency @xmath61 ( dashed lines ) as a function of the applied bias voltage for different temperatures of the cold reservoir .",
    "( b ) efficiency at maximum power as a function of the carnot efficiency .",
    "parameters are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath62 , @xmath63.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( a ) power @xmath60 ( solid lines ) and efficiency @xmath61 ( dashed lines ) as a function of the applied bias voltage for different temperatures of the cold reservoir .",
    "( b ) efficiency at maximum power as a function of the carnot efficiency .",
    "parameters are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath62 , @xmath63.,title=\"fig : \" ]    so far , we demonstrated that our quantum - dot heat engine can convert a heat current into a directed charge current . in a next step ,",
    "we want to generate a finite output power by adding a load to the system .",
    "hence , we apply a bias voltage @xmath4 across the conductor dot against which the heat - driven current can perform work .",
    "the output power is then simply given as @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown as a function of the applied bias in a ) . for zero bias ,",
    "the output power obviously vanishes .",
    "similarly , it vanishes at the so called stopping voltage @xmath64 where the heat- and bias - driven currents compensate each other such that @xmath65 . in between",
    ", the system reaches its maximal output power . for situations close to equilibrium",
    ", the maximum power is reached at half the stopping voltage . as the system",
    "is taken far away from equilibrium by lowering @xmath14 , the point of maximum power is shifted towards larger bias voltages .",
    "another important quantity to characterize the thermoelectric performance of a heat engine is its efficiency of heat to work conversion .",
    "it is defined as the ratio between the output power and the input heat which in our case is given by the heat current flowing out of the hot reservoir , i.e. , we have @xmath5 . in the tight - coupling limit , the efficiency grows linearly with the applied bias voltage and we simply have @xmath66 , cf .",
    "hence , at the stopping voltage @xmath67 the device reaches carnot efficiency @xmath68 indicating that it operates as an optimal heat to current converter . however , at this point , the heat engine operates reversibly and , therefore , does not produce any output power . a more relevant quantity to consider is the efficiency at maximum power .",
    "it is shown as a function of the temperature bias in b ) .",
    "for a small temperature bias , it increases linearly as @xmath69 in agreement with a general thermodynamic bound for systems with time - reversal symmetry  @xcite . in the nonlinear regime",
    ", it grows faster than @xmath69 and even reaches @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "we remark , however , that at this point our master equation approach is no longer valid since higher order tunneling contributions that give rise to a broadening of the dot level become important .      up to now",
    ", we only discussed the average transport of heat and charge through the quantum - dot heat engine .",
    "however , at the nanoscale , fluctuations of average quantities turn out to be important  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we discussed above how the generation of current depends on the correlation of charge fluctuations in the two dots .    a way to characterize these fluctuations is to look at the full counting statistics @xmath72 which addresses the probability that @xmath73 electrons have passed through the system in a given time @xmath74  @xcite . in a quantum dot system , this quantity can actually be measured by coupling a charge sensor such as a quantum point contact or a single - electron transistor to the quantum dot  @xcite . as the number of electrons on the dot changes , the electrical potential felt by the charge sensor changes , thus leading to a change in the current through it .",
    "this allows to measure the charge on the quantum dot in real time .",
    "interestingly , in the quantum - dot heat engine we can not only access the full counting statistics of charge but also of heat  @xcite . measuring the charge of both , the conductor and the gate dot , e.g. , via a quantum point contact that couples asymmetrically to the two dots , allows us to reconstruct the counting statistics of heat from the counting statistics of charge due to the intimate relationship between heat and charge transfer in the system . this way ,",
    "non - equilibrium fluctuation relations can be measured that relate the charge and heat currents  @xcite in terms of electron counting .",
    "this is important because in the presence of temperature gradients , fluctuation relations for charge currents  @xcite become configuration - dependent  @xcite unless one also considers energy currents .",
    "notably , the charge fluctuation theorem becomes universal ( only depending on the thermodynamic forces ) in the tight - coupling limit  @xcite .",
    "additional insight of the thermoelectric performance of the quantum - dot heat engine can be accessed by investigating the charge and heat current - current correlations  @xcite .",
    "the interest on electronic heat noise has appeared only very recently  @xcite .",
    "already in the linear regime the charge - heat cross - correlations are related to seebeck - like and peltier - like coefficients by means of an extended three - terminal fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "far from equilibrium , dimensionless quantities for the auto- and cross - correlations ( charge and heat fano factors , and cross - correlation coefficient ) can be defined .",
    "divergences of the charge fano factor can be used to measure the non - linear thermovoltage .",
    "most interestingly , the charge - heat cross - correlations are maximal in the tight - coupling limit  @xcite , leading to carnot - efficient configurations  @xcite .",
    "as we have just discussed , capacitively coupled quantum dots in the coulomb - blockade regime can operate as optimal heat to charge current converters that can reach carnot efficiency . yet",
    ", they are of limited practical use for energy harvesting applications as they provide only small currents and output power .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that transport in these systems occurs via the tunneling of single electrons . in the following",
    "we elucidate the thermoelectric performance of a device based on chaotic cavities coupled to electronic reservoirs via quantum point contacts with a large number of open transport channels  @xcite .",
    "our main aim is to discuss how current , power and efficiency behave as the number of open channels is changed .",

    "while most of the setups presented in this review were described in terms of minimal models , it would be interesting to have more realistic descriptions that include , e.g. , charging effects in quantum wells or provide a microscopic model of heat injection into the central region of the resonant tunneling heat engines .",
    "furthermore , the influence of phonons has to be better understood as they not only degrade the efficiency but also make it hard to maintain a given temperature bias across the device",
    ". in particular , it would be desirable to investigate systems where an analytic treatment of their influence can be made and to invent setups where they can be controlled in a systematic way .",
    "another interesting question addresses the thermoelectric performance of multi - terminal heat engines with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "theoretically , these devices allow to get arbitrarily close to carnot efficiency at finite output power . but how close can any physical realization actually get ? finally , the field of mesoscopic energy harvesting will greatly benefit from experiments that demonstrate that the theoretical ideas presented in this review can also be put into practice .",
    "above all , we are deeply indebted to the support and inspiration of the late markus bttiker during many years of collaborations that led to our works presented in this review .",
    "we furthermore acknowledge numerous fruitful discussions with c. bergenfeldt , h. buhmann , c. flindt , f. hartmann , p. jacquod , a. m. lunde , r. lpez , i. martin , l. molenkamp , m. moskalets , p. samuelsson , d. snchez , j. splettstoesser , h. thierschmann , r. whitney and l. worschech .",
