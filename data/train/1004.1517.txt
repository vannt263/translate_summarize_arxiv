    "the @xmath0po nucleus is the last member of the @xmath9th radioactive chain . as early as 1916",
    ", rutherford and wood discovered  @xcite the emission of @xmath1 particles from the end of this chain , the `` active deposit '' of thorium ( formerly named as thb ) .",
    "many years later , this was interpreted as the @xmath1 decays of several states of @xmath0po , particularly its ground state which is a pure @xmath1 emitter , with a very short half - life , 0.299(2 )  @xmath10s .",
    "afterwards new @xmath1 activities were produced by heavy / light - ion bombardments of bismuth and lead , and their decay spectra were measured  @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that an @xmath1-line at 11.6  mev arises directly from an isomeric state of @xmath0po with a half - life of 45  s , i.e. @xmath11 longer than the ground - state one . the very large hindrance factor for this @xmath1 emission",
    "was explained by spin and parity assignments of 18@xmath12 for the @xmath0po isomeric state , which has been located at 2.9  mev excitation energy .    besides these two extreme states",

    "the @xmath0po nucleus has been also studied in neutron - evaporation channels from total - fusion reactions , using either a radioactive target  @xcite , @xmath15pb(@xmath1 , 2n ) , or a radioactive beam  @xcite , @xmath2pb(@xmath16he,4n ) . however",
    ", the limited number of the target nuclei or the projectiles did not sizeably improve the spectroscopic data obtained in the @xmath2pb(@xmath14be,@xmath1 n ) reaction  @xcite .",
    "there were numerous attempts to give a microscopic description of the @xmath1 decay of the ground state of @xmath0po .",
    "the use of shell - model configurations fails to reproduce the large value of its rate by an order of magnitude , meaning that the @xmath1-particle formation is badly predicted within this approach .",
    "when complemented by cluster - model - type basis states  @xcite , the decay width is predicted in good agreement with the experimental value , the amount of @xmath1 clustering in the ground state of @xmath0po being @xmath170.3 .",
    "this is not far from the high degrees of clustering well known in some light nuclei where the two neutrons and the two protons occupy the same orbit , which is not fulfilled in the present case .",
    "the existence of the @xmath1 cluster would also act upon the properties of the excited states of @xmath0po .",
    "whereas shell - model approaches work well to predict the excitation energy of the yrast states  @xcite , they can not reproduce their large experimental b(e2 ) transition strengths , which are well accounted for from the @xmath1 clustering ( see for instance refs .",
    "all these results point to the fact that the positive - parity yrast states do contain both components , shell - model configurations and @xmath1 clustering , which are not easy to disentangle .    in this paper , we present a new class of excited states of @xmath0po , which have non - natural parity and are connected by enhanced e1 transitions to the yrast states .",
    "low - lying shell - model excitations do not lead to such non - natural parity states and these states are the first experimental evidence of `` pure '' @xmath1-cluster states in heavy nuclei .",

    "then we discuss the oscillatory motion of the @xmath1-core distance which may give rise to non - natural parity states .",
    "a letter highlighting parts of the present study has been recently published  @xcite .",
    "excited states in @xmath0po were populated by @xmath1 transfer using the @xmath3o@xmath19pb reaction , the @xmath3o beam with an energy of 85  mev being provided by the vivitron tandem of ires ( strasbourg ) .",
    "a 100  mg/@xmath20 self - supporting target of @xmath2pb was employed , which was thick enough to stop the recoiling @xmath0po nuclei .",
    "it is worth noting that due to this large thickness , the @xmath3o beam was stopped in the pb target too , and therefore the incident energy covered a large range of values , above and below the coulomb barrier .",
    "the kinematics of the @xmath1 transfer leading to high - spin states in @xmath0po in this experiment is detailed below ( see sect .  [ kinematics ] ) .",
    "the de - exciting @xmath5-rays were recorded with the euroball iv array consisting of 71 compton - suppressed ge detectors  @xcite ( 15 cluster germanium detectors placed in the backward hemisphere with respect to the beam , 26 clover germanium detectors located around 90@xmath21 , 30 tapered single - crystal germanium detectors located at forward angles ) .",
    "each cluster detector is composed of seven closely packed large - volume ge crystals @xcite and each clover detector consists of four smaller ge crystals  @xcite .",
    "the 239 ge crystals of the euroball array could be grouped into 13 rings , with the following angles with respect to the beam axis , 15.5@xmath21 ( 5 crystals ) , 34.6@xmath21 ( 10 ) , 52.3@xmath21 ( 15 ) , 72.2@xmath21 ( 26 ) , 80.9@xmath21 ( 26 ) , 99.1@xmath21 ( 26 ) , 107.5@xmath21 ( 26 ) , 122.6@xmath21 ( 10 ) , 130.5@xmath21 ( 30 ) , 138.7@xmath21 ( 25 ) , 148.1@xmath21 ( 15 ) , 155.9@xmath21 ( 15 ) , and 163.5@xmath21 ( 10 ) , i.e. 3 rings forward , 4 rings close to 90@xmath21 and 6 rings backward with respect to the beam axis .",
    "events were recorded on tape when at least 3 unsuppressed ge detectors fired in prompt coincidence . in this way ,",
    "a set of @xmath22 three- and higher - fold events were available for subsequent analysis , but only a small part of these data corresponds to @xmath0po events .",
    "indeed the main objective of the experiment was actually the study of the fusion - fission channel which leads to the production of the high - spin states of @xmath23 fragments , mainly located on the neutron - rich side of the valley of stability  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0po study became itself a goal when it turned out that its main @xmath5 lines were strong enough in our data set to be precisely analyzed .",
    "we have estimated that the cross section of the exit channel leading to @xmath0po is @xmath17 10 - 20  mb , i.e. @xmath17 10 - 20% of the cross section of the fusion - fission channel .",
    "various procedures have then been used for the offline analysis in order to fully characterize the excited levels of @xmath0po ( excitation energy , spin and parity values , decay modes , and multipole matrix elements ) .",
    "both multi - gated spectra and three - dimensional cubes have been built and analyzed with the radware package @xcite , starting from the known transitions deexciting the yrast states  @xcite .",
    "we have checked whether the reaction mechanism involved here leads to spin alignments of @xmath0po with respect to the beam axis .",
    "thus we have chosen several yrast transitions which are known to be quadrupole ones with @xmath24 ( such as the 727 , 405 , and 357  kev transitions ) or dipole ones with @xmath25 ( such as the 577  kev one ) .",
    "their angular distributions have been found to be symmetric around 90@xmath21 ( see examples in fig.[distrib_yrast ] ) , the intensity of the quadrupole transitions being maximum along the beam axis , whereas the one of the dipole transition is maximum at 90@xmath21 , demonstrating that the spins are aligned in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis .    when fitted using standard legendre polynomials @xmath26 , the obtained values of the angular coefficient @xmath27/@xmath28 indicate that the alignment is partial , with an attenuation coefficient @xmath29 0.7  @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to analyze each gamma - ray angular distribution to determine its multipole order . in order to characterize the transitions having too weak intensity to be analyzed in that way",
    ", their anisotropies have been determined using the intensities measured at two angles relative to the beam axis , r@xmath30=i@xmath31(39.3@xmath21)/ i@xmath31(76.6@xmath21 ) , these two angles being the average angle of the tapered and cluster detectors in the one hand , and the average angle of the clover detectors in the other hand , when taking into account the symmetry of the distribution around 90@xmath21 .",
    "assuming the same attenuation coefficient as mentioned above ( @xmath29 0.7 ) theoretical ado ratios of 0.85 and 1.30 are expected for pure stretched dipole and quadrupole transitions , respectively .",
    "the analysis of @xmath5-@xmath5 angular correlations of the most intense transitions has been also performed , in order to get rid of the spin alignment process .",
    "for that purpose , the coincidence rates of two successive @xmath5 transitions are analyzed as a function of @xmath32 , the average relative angle between the two fired detectors .",
    "the euroball  iv spectrometer had @xmath33  =  28441 combinations of 2 crystals , out of which only @xmath17 2000 involved different values of relative angle within 2@xmath21 .",
    "therefore , in order to keep reasonable numbers of counts , all the angles ( taking into account the symmetry around 90@xmath21 ) have been gathered around three average relative angles : 22@xmath21 , 46@xmath21 , and 75@xmath21 .",
    "the coincidence rate is increasing between 0@xmath21 and 90@xmath21 for the dipole - quadrupole cascades , whereas it decreases for the quadrupole - quadrupole or dipole - dipole ones .",
    "more precisely , the angular correlation functions at the three angles of interest were calculated for several combinations of spin sequences ( see table [ correl_th ] ) , corresponding to typical multipole orders ( quadrupole , dipole ) and typical spin changes ( @xmath34 ) . in order to check the method ,",
    "angular correlations of transitions belonging to the yrast cascades of the fission fragments produced in this experiment and having well - known multipole orders were analyzed and the expected values were found in all cases  @xcite .",
    ".[correl_th ] values of the angular correlation functions expected for several combinations of spin values , normalized to the ones calculated at 75@xmath21 : for each @xmath35 sequence given in the first column , the spin changes due to the two consecutive transitions are given in the second column .

    "the inset gives a zoom on the four fits to emphasize the behaviour of the @xmath39=128 isotones , @xmath40th ( triangle left ) , @xmath41ra ( triangle up ) , @xmath42rn ( triangle down ) and @xmath0po ( circle ) .",
    "[ alphas_pornrath],width=264 ]    the half - life values extend over 10 orders of magnitude , thus we give a zoom on the behaviour of the four @xmath39=128 isotones , in the inset of fig .",
    "[ alphas_pornrath ] .",
    "their measured @xmath1 half - lives are greater than the values expected from the fits ( each empty symbol lies above the corresponding line ) , allowing us to calculate the hindrance factors ( hf ) , i.e. the ratio of the experimental half - life and the extrapolated value ( given in the last column of table  [ coeff_geiger - nuttall ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ geiger - nuttall ] ) mainly accounts for the @xmath1 tunnelling through the potential barrier , but does not take into account any variation of the probability of @xmath1 formation in the parent nuclei . actually the quality of the fits shown in fig .",
    "[ alphas_pornrath ] proves that this probability remains almost the same along an isotopic series as soon as _ at least _ two pairs of neutrons are available ( i.e. n@xmath43 130 ) . on the other hand , the hindrance factors of the n  =  128 isotones ( hf @xmath44 1 ) mean that it is more difficult to form an @xmath1 particle in the parent nuclei which have _ only _ two neutrons above a magic number .",
    "as seen in the last column of table  [ coeff_geiger - nuttall ] , the hf values increase regularly as @xmath45 is decreasing from @xmath45  =  90 to 86 , while the value for @xmath46po is almost the same as the @xmath47rn one .",
    "this means that the @xmath0po half - life is smaller than expected from the behaviour of its heavier isotones .",
    "such a result is likely due to a greater value of the probability of @xmath1 formation in the @xmath0po ground state , a sign of its cluster structure , @xmath1 + @xmath2pb .",
    "it is worth recalling that the amount of clustering predicted by an hybrid model comprising both shell and cluster configurations  @xcite is high ( 30% ) .    using the partial half - lives given the last column of table  [ alpha_branching ] , the hf values of two excited states of @xmath0po can be computed as well , hf@xmath48 and hf@xmath49 . in those cases , because of the conservation of the total angular momentum , the alpha emission occurs at non - zero value of orbital angular momentum , giving rise to a centrifugal potential which increases the potential barrier and slows down the tunnelling process  @xcite .",
    "it would have been interesting to make quantitative comparisons with transitions involving similar variations of angular momentum in neighbouring nuclei , in order to look for hint of cluster structure in these excited states .",
    "unfortunately the number of cases available in the literature  @xcite is too scarce .",
    "finally we have to note that the new values of the @xmath1 branching ratios of the 4@xmath50 , 6@xmath50 and 8@xmath50 states given in table  [ alpha_branching ] are in good agreement with the predictions of the @xmath1-cluster models of @xmath0po ( see for instance refs .",

    "the structure of this octupole vibration comprises many coherent particle - hole excitations across the two magic gaps at @xmath54 and @xmath55 involving several single - particle orbits with @xmath56 .",
    "when the fermi levels are located well above these two gaps , namely for @xmath57 134 and @xmath58 88 , the octupole mode is enhanced because of strong octupole couplings between two pairs of orbits ( @xmath59 in the one hand , @xmath60 in the other hand ) .    in between , there are various mixings of the 3@xmath52 excitation of the @xmath2pb core and the single - particle excitations from these pairs of orbits .",
    "for instance , in @xmath15pb , the 3@xmath52 collective excitation of the core and the 3@xmath52 state of the @xmath59 configuration , expected close in energy , are so strongly mixed that the measured octupole strength is split into two states 1  mev apart ( 1869  kev and 2828  kev ) .",

    "we suppose that the individual potential wells are deep enough to accomodate two states , the ground state and an excited state ( @xmath95= 0 and 1 ) . the excited state may be interpreted as a vibration of the @xmath1 particle against the @xmath2pb core .",

    "we surmise that the small @xmath1-grain on top of @xmath2pb perturbs sphericity only slightly .",
    "it will produce double - well scenarios weakly depending on spin .",
    "this naturally will produce for each spin quadruplets of states with alternating parities , i.e. four components @xmath97 for eq .",
    "let us mention that spin projection also takes care of the @xmath98 mode where the @xmath1 particle vibrates against the pb core .",
    "these four cluster states still have to be mixed and orthogonalized with the sm configurations as indicated in eq .  [ fo ] . among the low - lying quadruplet of states belonging to the yrast band",
    ", only the positive - parity states will be affected .",
    "actually the mixing may be relatively strong ( it is predicted that the ground state contains about 30% alpha - cluster configuration  @xcite ) pushing the other positive parity states up into energy regions where the highest member is yet to be detected .",
    "this also eventually explains why the natural order of + , - , + , - parities is changed to + , - , - , + .",
    "this picture qualitatively explains the experimental situation for the quadruplet of states of even spin comprising the ones of the yrast band ( see fig .",
    "[ states_212po]a ) .",
    "one easily imagines that the projection on odd - spin values creates states at higher energy , since already at sphericity the odd - spin , negative - parity states are above the ones with even spins .",

    "[ states_212po ] could find a natural explanation within the above lines of thought .    to be slightly more specific ,",

    "we also can reproduce the falling tendency of b(e1 ) vs @xmath107 ( see fig .",
    "[ levels_be1 ] ) rather accurately .",
    "the above scenario remains on a very schematic level .",
    "it should be verified by more microscopic studies which are planned for the future .",
    "the oscillatory motion of the @xmath1-core distance around the equilibrium position is proposed for the first time .",
    "this would be a novel manifestation of @xmath1-clustering , never noticed in light systems . in those cases ,",
    "the @xmath1-core system can rotate collectively about its center of mass ( for a review of the so - called nuclear molecules , see  @xcite ) and it is probably difficult to isolate an oscillatory motion , if any .    in the chart of nuclides , there are two cases similar to @xmath0po : @xmath108te as @xmath1+@xmath109sn and @xmath110te as @xmath1+@xmath111sn. these @xmath1-core systems fulfill the two prerequisites :    * the ground state of the composite nucleus is above or close to the @xmath1-decay threshold ( cf .",
    "the _ ikeda _",
    "diagram displayed in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) . * the center of mass of the @xmath1-core system is nearly merged with the center of the spherical core , so as the system can not rotate collectively .",
    "having the same value of dipole moment as @xmath0po , @xmath112te should exhibit enhanced electric dipole transitions . on the other hand ,",
    "the decay of the cluster states of @xmath113te should be different since the e1 transitions are hindered as there is no shift between the center of charge and the center of charge , the two clusters having @xmath114 .",
    "thus the @xmath1 emission could compete for their decay .",
    "one may speculate that adding more @xmath1 s to the @xmath2pb core , like , e.g. two @xmath1 s to give @xmath41rn , may exhibit similar physics .",
    "for example the two @xmath1 s may move coherently as a @xmath16be and then the present scenario may repeat itself partially , or the two @xmath1 s may move independently and , then , more complex structures can be expected .",
    "in summary , we have used the transfer of an @xmath1-particle induced by a heavy - ion beam at very low energy to populate excited states of @xmath0po .",
    "the level scheme has been extended up to @xmath6  mev excitation energy .",
    "the @xmath5 angular distributions and @xmath7 angular correlations have been analyzed in order to assign spin and parity values to many observed states .",
    "several @xmath5 lines with e@xmath8 1  mev have been found to be strongly shifted and broadened by the doppler effect , allowing for the measurements of the corresponding lifetimes by the dsam method .",
    "the values , found in the range [ 0.1 - 0.6 ]  ps , lead to very enhanced e1 transitions .",
    "* the first one comprises all the states having natural parity .",
    "they bear strong resemblance with those identified in the neighbouring isotopes and isotones and can be explained in terms of single - particle excitations dealing with the neutron and proton orbits lying close to the fermi levels , as well as their coupling to the 3@xmath52 octupole vibration .",
    "nevertheless more stringent analysis reveals that several properties ( such as b(e2 ) transition probabilities or @xmath1-emission probabilities ) are not accounted for by such an interpretation . *",
    "the second one comprises many states having non - natural parity which are mainly grouped into 2 sets , a first one with even-@xmath79 values around 2  mev excitation energy and a second one with odd-@xmath79 values around 3  mev .",
    "these levels only decay to the yrast states having the same @xmath79 value , by very enhanced e1 transitions ( b(e1 ) @xmath115  @xmath116  w.u . ) .",
