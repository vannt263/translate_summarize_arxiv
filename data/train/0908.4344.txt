    "in the late 1990s , hof , lucas and mullin  @xcite described five distinct steady patterns observed experimentally in a cylindrical rayleigh - bnard convection cell at identical parameter values .",
    "more precisely , the patterns observed were torus , two- , three- , and four - roll states , and a mercedes pattern , at prandtl number @xmath0 , rayleigh number @xmath1 , and an aspect ratio @xmath2radius / height=2 with insulating lateral boundaries . in our previous work  @xcite , we reproduced numerically the five patterns observed by hof and determined the approximate limits in rayleigh number over which they could be observed . at lower rayleigh numbers , we simulated several other patterns  dipole , pizza , and two - tori  as well as some time - periodic patterns .",
    "these results are summarized in figure [ fig : dns : neu ] .",
    "our viewpoint , pioneered in the 1980s by benjamin and mullin  @xcite , is that these observations can be best understood and organized by constructing the bifurcation diagram corresponding to this figure . in particular , we wish to trace connections between the patterns observed at high and at low rayleigh numbers , and to the basic conductive state wherever possible .    the classical analysis of onset of rayleigh - bnard convection describes an instability of the conductive state to a pattern of straight parallel rolls of infinite length .",
    "however , such a pattern is clearly not realizable in a small - aspect - ratio cylinder .",
    "rolls must be curved to fit into the container , as shown in the two- , three- and four - roll states illustrated in figure [ fig : dns : neu ] .",
    "in addition , a primary bifurcation , that is , a bifurcation from the conductive state , is associated with an eigenmode which is necessarily trigonometric in the azimuthal angle , such as the dipole or pizza states , or two - tori and torus states of figure [ fig : dns : neu ] .",
    "the focus of this paper is the relationship between trigonometric modes and roll states and , more generally , the bifurcation - theoretic genesis of the profusion of states in this configuration .    in our companion paper  @xcite , we reviewed some of the literature on rayleigh - bnard convection in small - aspect - ratio cylindrical geometries , focusing on pattern competition .",
    "the previous investigations most relevant to this manuscript , in addition to those of hof et al .",
    "@xcite , are the full nonlinear simulations of leong @xcite and of ma  @xcite ; we will compare our results to these articles where appropriate .",
    "in section [ sec : background ] we state the governing equations and the symmetries of the configuration .",
    "section [ sec : numerical ] describes the numerical methods we have used to compute steady states and their stability . section [ sec : results ] begins by presenting the full bifurcation diagram and primary bifurcations .",
    "we then give a detailed analysis of branches corresponding to each azimuthal wavenumber .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .    , the perturbed conductive initial condition leads to a pizza state . using the pizza state at @xmath3 as an initial condition leads to a four - roll state at @xmath4 , to the three - roll state at @xmath5 , and to a two - roll state at @xmath6 . +",

    "we recall from our companion paper  @xcite the dimensionless navier  stokes and boussinesq equations governing the system :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the nondimensionalized deviation of the temperature from the linear vertical conductive profile .",
    "the parameter values are as follows : @xmath9 the container is assumed to have rigid walls , with thermally conducting horizontal bounding plates and thermally insulating sidewalls    [ eq : bcs ] @xmath10      the bifurcations that this system can undergo are dictated by its symmetries . in group - theoretic terms , the conductive state has @xmath11 symmetry in the azimuthal angle , meaning that it is invariant under all rotations and reflections in @xmath12 :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 indicates an arbitrary angle of rotation or axis of reflection , and all compositions of these transformations . under the boussinesq approximation ,",
    "the conductive state is also invariant under simultaneous reflection in @xmath15 and change in sign of the temperature perturbation : @xmath16 this symmetry can be combined with the @xmath12-rotation symmetry to yield : @xmath17 [ eq : o2 ]    a form whose utility will appear shortly .",
    "the full symmetry group of the conductive state is thus @xmath18 .",
    "a steady bifurcation from the axisymmetric conductive state , i.e.  a primary bifurcation , is necessarily associated with an eigenvector which is trigonometric in the azimuthal direction ; see , e.g. crawford & knobloch  @xcite .",
    "each bifurcating branch is thus associated with an azimuthal wavenumber @xmath19 . for @xmath20",
    ", symmetry is broken and the bifurcation is a pitchfork , leading to two branches . if @xmath19 is non - zero , the bifurcation is a circle pitchfork , producing families of states of arbitrary orientation . for the bifurcating states , @xmath11 symmetry is replaced by @xmath21 , meaning that they are invariant under rotation by angles which are multiples of @xmath22 and reflections in @xmath23 axes of symmetry :    @xmath24    [ eq : dm ]    where @xmath25 is taken to be one of the axes of symmetry of the pattern , and is trivially verified if @xmath26 .",
    "these equations generate the symmetry group @xmath27 .",
    "these states have a zero eigenvalue , corresponding to the marginal stability to rotation of the pattern .",
    "equations can be seen to be special cases of .",
    "( the form of is the reason we choose , instead of the boussinesq reflection operator , as a generator of the symmetry group . )",
    "primary branches can undergo secondary pitchfork bifurcations which break the @xmath28 symmetry .",
    "the resulting branches , which we will call `` asymmetric '' , nonetheless have @xmath21 symmetry , generated by the discrete rotation symmetry and the reflection symmetry .",
    "in  @xcite we described our code for integrating the time - dependent boussinesq equations in a cylindrical geometry .",
    "we have modified this time - dependent code using the techniques described in @xcite to carry out continuation by newton s method and linear stability analysis by the exponential arnoldi method .",
    "we describe these modifications in the subsections which follow .",
    "to do so , we will write the boussinesq equations schematically as @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the viscous , diffusive and buoyancy operators and @xmath31 the advective terms .",
    "@xmath32 represents the spatially discretized temperature deviation @xmath8 and velocity field @xmath33 .",
    "the imposition of boundary conditions and incompressibility are assumed to be included in the representations of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath34 . here",
    ", we assume that timestepping is carried out via the first - order formula : @xmath35 i.e.  the terms in @xmath30 are treated via the implicit backwards euler scheme and those in @xmath31 by the explicit forwards euler scheme .",
    "the code uses a pseudo - spectral spatial discretization , in which @xmath8 , @xmath36 are approximated as : @xmath37 while @xmath38 odd is used for @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "differentiation is carried out on the spectral representation , while multiplications are performed after transforming to a grid , and then transforming the result back to the spectral representation . for the aspect ratio @xmath41 investigated here , we use @xmath42 gridpoints or chebyshev polynomials in the radial direction , @xmath43 gridpoints or trigonometric functions in the azimuthal direction and @xmath44 gridpoints or chebyshev polynomials in the axial direction .",
    "thus the domain is represented by approximately @xmath45 gridpoints and each solution by a vector of size @xmath46 .",

    "the boundary conditions are imposed via the tau method , and incompressibility to machine accuracy is insured via an influence matrix technique .",
    "steady states are found by calculating the roots of @xmath49 , which are the same as those of @xmath50 _ for any value of _",
    "@xmath51 , as shown by the following calculation : @xmath52\\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( i-\\delta t \\mathcal{l})^{-1}\\delta t ( \\mathcal{n } + \\mathcal{l}).\\label{eq : difftimestep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the roots of @xmath49 are found by newton iteration :    @xmath53    [ eq : newton ]    where the linear operator @xmath54 is the jacobian of @xmath49 evaluated at @xmath34 : @xmath55 while @xmath56 is the current estimate for the steady state and @xmath57 is an unknown correction to @xmath34 .",
    "the action @xmath58 is obtained from @xmath59 merely by carrying out the replacements    @xmath60    [ eq : jacobian ]    in the nonlinear terms of - . since the boundary conditions are homogeneous , they remain unchanged .",
    "we iterate until @xmath61 is lower than some threshold , which we usually take to be @xmath62 , or until a maximum number of iterations , which we take to be 10 , has been surpassed , meaning that the newton procedure has failed .",
    "we use the norm @xmath63    the size of the matrix representing the linear operator in is @xmath64 and so the system is far too large to be solved directly .",
    "instead we use the biconjugate gradient stabilized algorithm @xcite , which requires the right - hand - side and a procedure for calculating the action of @xmath54 on a vector @xmath65",
    ". the right - hand - side of is shown by to be the difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , i.e.  between two ( widely spaced ) consecutive timesteps , while the left - hand - side is the difference between @xmath68 and @xmath67 , i.e.  between two _ linearized _ timesteps .",
    "conjugate gradient iteration proceeds until @xmath69 where the threshold @xmath70 is taken between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the reason for finding the roots of @xmath49 instead of those of @xmath50 is that , as shown by equation , @xmath73 this effective preconditioning by @xmath74 makes @xmath54 far better conditioned than @xmath75 , and greatly accelerates the convergence of bicgstab .",
    "note that @xmath76 is the limit _ opposite _ to that used in timestepping .",
    "we use @xmath77 ranging between 0.2 and 10 ( in contrast to the @xmath77 on the order of @xmath78 used in temporal integration ) .",
    "it is the solution of the linear system which poses the greatest difficulty and which determined the limits of our study . in some regions ,",
    "convergence of bicgstab required as few as 5 actions of @xmath79 , with more typical values ranging between 30 and 800 .",
    "in other regions , 4000 iterations did not suffice ( even sometimes far from any bifurcation , where singularity of @xmath54 is to be expected ) , and continuation of the branch was eventually abandoned .      in order to calculate a branch of steady states ,",
    "we carry out newton iteration repeatedly for different values of rayleigh number .",
    "generally , in the absence of turning points , one can merely use the converged solution for one @xmath80 to initialize the newton iteration for a neighboring @xmath80 .",
    "this initialization procedure constitutes zero - th order extrapolation .",
    "we reduce the increment or decrement @xmath81 in @xmath80 if the newton iteration failed to converge in @xmath82 iterations and increase @xmath81 if convergence took place sooner .",
    "specifically , if we have computed solutions @xmath83 , @xmath84 corresponding to @xmath85 , @xmath86 in @xmath87 , @xmath88 newton iterations , we set @xmath89 where we take @xmath82 between 2 and 5 .",
    "linear or quadratic extrapolation in @xmath80 is easy to implement .",
    "assume that converged solutions @xmath90 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 have been found for rayleigh numbers @xmath91 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we can determine coefficients @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 such that @xmath95 where @xmath96 ranges over both the gridpoints and the components @xmath97 .",
    "we then use to compute an initial condition for newton iteration at the new value @xmath98 given in .",
    "( the condition number of the @xmath99 system for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 is improved if we subtract from @xmath80 the average of the three @xmath80 values . ) over many portions of many branches we find we can easily take @xmath100 . as an example , we computed the marigold branch which will be described in section [ sec : three - fold ] from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , with intervals @xmath103 varied dynamically between 10 and 1200 according to prescription , requiring a computation time of 1200 cpu seconds on the nec sx-8 .",
    "quadratic extrapolation , while not necessary for moving along a branch , proves essential near a turning point . near a turning point @xmath104",
    ", we stop using extrapolation in @xmath80 , as in , and instead use extrapolation in one of the components of @xmath34 .",
    "that is , we fix the value of one component , @xmath105 , and treat @xmath80 as a dependent variable . to determine whether we are near a turning point , we use the fact that @xmath106 so that @xmath107 must eventually exceed @xmath81 as a turning point is approached .",
    "we monitor the relative changes by comparing the quantities @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a multiplicative weighting factor ranging between 5 ( to favor extrapolation in @xmath80 ) and 0.001 ( to favor extrapolation in @xmath110 ) .",
    "when @xmath111 exceeds @xmath112 , we replace , prescribing extrapolation in @xmath80 , by extrapolation in @xmath105 : @xmath113 we use the three previous converged fields and rayleigh numbers to determine coefficients @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 such that @xmath118 and then use to compute a new @xmath80 and @xmath119 corresponding to the @xmath105 prescribed by .",
    "this allows us to change direction in @xmath80 ; may lead to @xmath120 of opposite sign to that of @xmath121 , unlike in equation .",
    "the procedure above treats @xmath105 as an independent variable ( as prescribed in equation ) and @xmath80 as a dependent variable ( as prescribed in equation ) in the predictor step ( initialization ) . in this investigation ,",
    "we have left the corrector step ( newton iteration ) unchanged , that is , @xmath80 remains unaltered by .",
    "one strategy we have employed is to relax the tolerances near the turning point , for example to @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "like xin  @xcite , we have succeeded in traversing a number of turning points in this way , despite the near - singularity of the matrix @xmath124 near a bifurcation point .",
    "once branches have been computed , we wish to determine their stability . in order to perform linear stability analysis of a steady state @xmath56 ,",
    "we carry out time integration of the boussinesq equations linearized about @xmath34 for an infinitesimal perturbation @xmath57 : @xmath125 we use the same timestepping formula as for the nonlinear problem : @xmath126 by carrying out the substitutions in . since @xmath127 the eigenvalues @xmath128 of @xmath129 and eigenvalues @xmath130 of @xmath131 are related via @xmath132 the stability of @xmath133 is determined by the sign of the leading eigenvalue @xmath134 ( that with largest real part ) of @xmath131 , which corresponds to the dominant eigenvalue @xmath135 ( that with largest magnitude ) of @xmath129 .",
    "equation prescribes acting with the linear operator @xmath129 on @xmath136 ; when repeated over many @xmath137 s , @xmath138 will converge to the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath135 , which is itself approximated by the rayleigh quotient @xmath139    to determine several leading eigenvalues , the power method is generalized to the arnoldi - krylov method  @xcite .",
    "this consists of orthonormalizing a small number of fields @xmath140 to create vectors @xmath141 , and then a small hessenberg matrix @xmath142 , which is directly diagonalised .",
    "its eigenvalues approximate eigenvalues @xmath128 of @xmath129 , while its eigenvectors @xmath143 consist of coefficients of the vectors @xmath144 , to be combined to form approximate eigenvectors @xmath145 of @xmath129 .",
    "the accuracy of these approximate eigenpairs is measured by the residue @xmath146 in the case of complex eigenvalues .",
    "the integration of is continued until the residues of the desired eigenvalues are below some acceptance criterion , usually near @xmath147 .",
    "the timestep required is similar to that for timestepping .",
    "one obvious restriction comes from the explicit scheme used in for @xmath148 ; a timestep which violates this stability requirement leads to approximate eigenvalues of @xmath129 which bear no resemblance to those of @xmath149 . for smaller @xmath77 ,",
    "the accuracy of the eigenvalues depends on @xmath77 because of the approximation . in particular",
    ", the time - splitting error means that @xmath129 is not a function of @xmath131 .",
    "( in contrast , the errors in the pitchfork and turning point bifurcation thresholds obtained by newton s method result only from the spatial discretization . )",
    "we have used @xmath150 for @xmath151 and @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "we estimate our accuracy in locating bifurcation points and stability ranges to be @xmath154 .",
    "we used @xmath155 vectors and a time interval of @xmath156 , i.e.  @xmath157 or @xmath158 to create the krylov vectors , and an acceptance criterion for the residues of @xmath147 .    a method which produces approximate eigenvalues which are independent of @xmath77 is the inverse arnoldi method  @xcite ,",
    "in which is replaced by @xmath159 this is accomplished in practice by solving the equation @xmath160 the equivalence between and follows from a calculation similar to .",
    "equation is very similar to and is also solved by bicgstab . only a few iterations ( between 1 and 10 ) of lead to an extremely accurate eigenvalue .",
    "however , the inverse arnoldi is more difficult to implement than the exponential arnoldi method .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen not to do so for this study .",
    "using the methods described in section [ sec : numerical ] , we have succeeded in continuing the branches we found previously via time integration  @xcite . by going around turning points and bifurcation points , we have computed a total of 17 branches of convective steady states .",
    "these are related to the conductive state and to each other by 5 primary and 3 secondary pitchfork bifurcations , and 8 saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "the bifurcation diagram is shown in figure [ fig : bifdiag_full ] .",
    "tables summarizing all of the branches and bifurcations we have found are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the axes of figure [ fig : bifdiag_full ] have been chosen with care . in order to show the full extent of our calculations in rayleigh number and , at the same time , distinguish between various low - rayleigh - number primary bifurcations , figure [ fig : bifdiag_full ] uses a logarithmic scale in @xmath80 .",
    "more specifically , using @xmath161 distinguishes primary bifurcations better than @xmath162 .",
    "the vertical axis was chosen to best distinguish between the various branches .",
    "the quantity @xmath163 is the maximum absolute value of the temperature deviation over the ring at @xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath163 itself and the commonly used nusselt number deviation @xmath166 have a strong linear dependence on @xmath80 ; plotting them directly as a function of @xmath80 does little to separate the branches .",
    "we have therefore chosen instead to represent each state by its value of @xmath167 .",
    "( exceptionally , for the first two - tori branch , we have plotted @xmath168 for low @xmath80 to avoid a reversal in slope due to the absolute value in . )",
    "each branch in figure [ fig : bifdiag_full ] is a representative of a number of branches  the group orbit  that can be obtained by reflection and rotations .",
    "we give in table [ tab : firstbif ] the first critical wavenumber and rayleigh number pairs .",
    "the thresholds given to @xmath169 are extrapolations from the branches calculated using newton s method .",
    "the thresholds given as integer values were calculated from the linear stability analysis of the conductive branch . in the remainder of the manuscript , we round rayleigh numbers to integer values ( except in a few very specific cases ) .",
    "our thresholds agree quite well with those of previous researchers .",
    "the discrepancies are typically on the order of @xmath170 with the calculations of ma  @xcite and on the order of @xmath171 with those of martin - witkowski  @xcite , which we believe to be the two most recent threshold calculations in this geometry . with increasing rayleigh number ,",
    "many other bifurcations occur from the conductive state , both to higher wavenumbers and to different eigenmodes with the same wavenumbers .",
    "the branches created at such bifurcations are necessarily unstable .",
