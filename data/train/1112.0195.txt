    "cooperative communication is a promising technology to improve quality and reliability of wireless links @xcite .",
    "one of the most important application scenarios of cooperative communications is cellular network . due to shadowing or deep fading of wireless channels ,",
    "base station may not be able to sufficiently cover all mobile terminals in a cell , especially those on the edge .",
    "deployment of relay stations is an effective and economic way to improve the communication quality in cellular networks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] .    in cooperative cellular networks , there are two major strategies in relaying .",
    "relay station can either decode the received signal before retransmission @xcite or simply amplify - and - forward ( af ) the received signal to the corresponding destination without decoding @xcite .",
    "af strategy has low complexity and minimal processing delay , and is more secure .",
    "these reasons make af preferable in practical implementation .",
    "in fact , deployment of af relay station with multiple antenna to enlarge coverage of base station is one of the most important components in the future communication protocols , e.g. , lte , imt - advanced and winner project @xcite , @xcite .    with multiple antennas at mobile terminals , relay station and base station ,",
    "a natural question is how to allocate limited power resource in the spatial domain . in general ,",
    "power allocation is equivalent to beamforming matrices design at base station , relay and mobile terminals , and the objective can be maximizing capacity @xcite or minimizing the mean - square error ( mse ) of the recovered data @xcite . the mse criterion is a widely chosen one since it aims at the data be recovered as accurate as possible , and is extensively used in power allocation in classical point - to - point @xcite or multi - user mimo systems@xcite .",
    "the mse minimization is also related to capacity maximization @xcite , @xcite if a suitable weighting is applied to different data streams .    in a cellular network ,",
    "the base station and relay station are usually allowed to be equipped with multiple antennas . for each mobile terminal , if it is equipped with single antenna , such relay cellular networks has been investigated from various point - of - views .",
    "for example , beamforming design for capacity maximization has been considered in @xcite , and quality - of - service based power control has been investigated in @xcite . however , in the next generation multi - media wireless communications , it is likely that the size of a mobile terminal allows multiple antennas to be deployed .",
    "unfortunately , extension from the previous works on single antenna mobile terminals to multi - antenna terminals is by no mean straightforward .    in this paper , we take a step further to consider the case where each mobile terminal is also equipped with multiple antennas . in particular , we consider the joint precoders , forwarding matrix , and equalizers design for both uplink and downlink af relaying cellular network , under power constraints .",
    "the design problems are formulated as optimization problem minimizing the sum mse of multiple detected data streams . while extension of the presented algorithm to weighted mse criterion is straightforward , we focus on sum mse for notational clarity .",
    "the contribution of the paper is as follows .",
    "firstly , in the downlink , the precoder at base station , forwarding matrix at relay station and equalizers at mobile terminals are jointly designed by an iterative algorithm .",
    "secondly , in the uplink case , we demonstrate that the formulation of the beamforming design problem has the same form as that in the downlink , and the same iterative algorithm can be employed .",
    "thirdly , since the general iterative solution provides little insight , we derive another algorithm under the specific case when the number of independent data streams from different mobile terminals is greater than or equal to their number of antenna .",
    "it is found that the resultant solution includes several existing algorithms for multi - user mimo or af relay network with single antenna as special cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sect : downlink ] , beamforming design problem in downlink is investigated , and an iterative algorithm is presented . in section  [",
    "sect : uplink ] , the analogy of the uplink and downlink beamforming design problems is demonstrated .",
    "furthermore , another beamforming design algorithm is derived for the specific case of fully loaded or overloaded system , and the relationships of this algorithm with other existing algorithms are discussed .",
    "simulation results are given in section  [ sect : simul ] to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms .",

    "@xmath178 separate lmmse design proposed for initialization of algorithm 1 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , it can be seen that as there is no precoder design at bs for the first two suboptimal algorithms , the data streams at different terminals can not be efficiently separated by linear equalizers , resulting in poor performances .",
    "the separate lmmse transceiver design has a much better performance . on the other hand",
    ", the proposed algorithm 1 has the best performance among the four algorithms .",
    "the gap between the mses of the separate lmmse design and that of algorithm 1 is the performance gain obtained by additional iterations .    as the proposed algorithm 1 involves a computational expensive sdp for the precoder @xmath60 design , it is of great interest to investigate how much degradation would result from skipping the precoder design .",

    "the second hop snr at mobile terminals @xmath200 is fixed to be 20db . from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , it can be seen that a properly designed precoder significantly improves the system performance when the first hop snr is high . without the precoder , the data mses exhibit error floors at much lower @xmath204 . on the other hand",
    ", we can also see that increasing the number of antennas at the relay station greatly improves the system performance , as it simultaneously increases the diversity gain of the two hops .",
    "now , let us turn to the results in the uplink . in uplink case ,",
    "the noise covariance matrices at relay station and bs are @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively .",
    "we define the fist hop snr at the relay station as @xmath208 , where @xmath209 .",

    "[ fig:6 ] shows the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm 2 for uplink when @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "notice that in this case , at each mobile terminal the number of antennas equals to that of the data streams , and algorithm 2 involves no relaxation .",
    "the initialization is identity matrices .",
    "it can be seen that algorithm 2 converges very fast , indicating its superior performance .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows the total data mses of the proposed algorithm 2 and suboptimal algorithms , when @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 and the snr at relay station @xmath211 is fixed to be 20db .",
    "the suboptimal algorithms are similar to those for the downlink . in particular",
    ", we consider    @xmath178 equalization of the equivalent two - hop channel is applied only at the bs .",
    "@xmath178 equalization is applied at relay station for the mobile - to - relay channel , and also at bs for the relay - to - bs channel .",
    "@xmath178 separate lmmse design .",
    "the first hop is considered as a traditional multiuser mimo uplink system , and the beamforming matrices are designed using the algorithms in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second hop is considered as a point - to - point mimo system , and the beamforming matrices are designed using the result in @xcite .    from fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , it can be seen that the performance of the proposed algorithm 2 is better than other suboptimal algorithms .",
    "however , as the signals from different terminals are cooperatively detected at bs , the gaps between the performance of the suboptimal algorithms from that of algorithm 2 is much smaller compared to their counterparts in downlink .",
    "when @xmath212 in the uplink , strictly speaking , algorithm 2 involves a relaxation , and its performance is not guaranteed .",
    "however , a simple variation of algorithm 1 can be used for beamforming design in this case .",
    "[ fig:8 ] shows the total data mses of algorithm 1 for uplink and algorithm 2 with rank relaxation , when @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "the snr at bs is fixed at @xmath210=20db . the joint relay forwarding matrix and destination equalizer design in @xcite",

    "this indicates the importance of source precoder design in af relay cellular networks . furthermore , although algorithm 2 involves a relaxation , its performance is still satisfactory , and is close to that of algorithm 1 .",
    "finally , it can also be concluded that increasing the number of antennas at relay station can greatly improve the performance of uplink beamforming design for all algorithms .",
