    "the following sub - sections present a discussion of the major results obtained .",
    "as described in @xmath8 3 , the light curve of observation 22 ( figure  [ 4lc ] ) exhibits an episode of very low flux which could be indicative of an eclipse .",
    "comparison with the asm light curve folded over the 11.599 d orbital period shows that this episode of very low - flux does not occur at the expected orbital minimum but instead just after the maximum .",
    "in addition , while the pulse modulation is not present during observations 4 and 18 , it can be seen clearly in observations 8 and 14 , all of which took place during similar orbital phases as observation 22 .",
    "thus , the low - flux episode in observation 22 is most likely due to a temporary suspension of accretion , possibly due to density fluctuations in the stellar wind .",
    "we did not find that the inclusion of an fe k@xmath7 gaussian emission feature improved the fit significantly in our analysis of the combined spectrum from all 22 observations .",
    "however , during our phase resolved spectral analyses over the pulse , orbital and super - orbital periods  where the 1@xmath11 systematic error was removed and the residuals due to the xenon l - edges were modelled using an absorption edge , so as to more accurately constrain the column density ( see  2 )  significant residuals around @xmath06.4 kev were observed in many of the spectra .",
    "addition of an fe k@xmath7 gaussian emission line was thus required in order to obtain the best fit .",
    "the energy for this line was fixed at 6.4 kev for the phase resolved analyses , as the energy could not be well constrained . while the equivalent widths of these lines ranged between @xmath060  800 ev , the estimated uncertainties were too large to determine whether the equivalent widths were correlated with any of the known periodicities .    @xcite note that in their observations the equivalent width of the iron line could only be constrained during the low - state of the spin period , as the emission feature was most strongly present during the episodes of low - flux .",
    "@xcite observed the same phenomenon , concluding that the fe emission was overwhelmed by the continuum emission in the high state and was thus only detectable during the minimum flux periods between pulses .",
    "in contrast , the relatively poor spectral resolution and sensitivity of the _ rxte _ pca meant that the parameters of the fe line could not be adequately constrained in our data .",
    "further observations with an instrument with greater spectral resolution and sensitivity than the _ rxte _ pca are required before a firm conclusion can be drawn as to the nature and variability of the fluorescent iron emission in this system .",
    "understanding the origin of this emission could lead to a clearer picture of the geometry and dynamics of the system , potentially supplying further evidence for the presence of a super - slow pulsar and providing an answer to the question of the origin of the super - orbital modulation .",
    "the crsf at @xmath022 kev reported by @xcite was not evident in any of our spectra , supporting the results of @xcite and @xcite who also failed to detect this feature .",
    "if the magnetic field of the neutron star in 2s 0114 + 650 is @xmath12 10@xmath13 g as suggested by @xcite , we would expect a crsf in the spectrum at @xmath12 9 kev .",
    "@xcite showed there to be a rough correlation between the energy of the cut - off and the cyclotron line energy in the spectra of accreting x - ray pulsars ( see their figure 4 ) . using a value of @xmath06 kev for the cut - off energy as determined from our spectral fits , 2s",
    "0114 + 650 should have a crsf line energy of @xmath06 kev and therefore a magnetic field strength of @xmath010@xmath13 g.    the scattering cross section has a strong dependence on the angle to the magnetic field , so that crsfs provide an excellent diagnostic of the emission geometry and the physical conditions of the radiating plasma @xcite .",
    "the angle between the photon direction and the magnetic field vector is thus a determining factor in the detection of cyclotron features in the spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the shape and relative depths of the crsf first and higher harmonics are thus highly dependent on the viewing geometry and the geometry of the scattering plasma @xcite . as a result",
    ", variations in the features are expected with the varying viewing geometry produced by the rotation of the neutron star . for the case",
    "where the photon direction and magnetic field vector are aligned , no cyclotron resonance scattering would be expected . in this scenario",
    "it may be possible to place some constraints on the accretion geometry ( e.g. fan beam / cyclinder vs pencil beam / slab geometry ) , rotation patterns and accretion rate through the absence of observable crsf lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the absence of any crsf features in the x - ray spectrum could indicate that the magnetic field strength is outside the observable bandwidth , indicating a field strength of either @xmath14 10@xmath13 g or @xmath15 10@xmath13 g. in either of these scenarios the crsf would occur at energies too low or too high for us to observe in our data .",
    "the detection of a ` high energy tail ' in the spectrum of 2s 0114 + 650 from analysis of @xmath16 ibis - isgri data was reported by @xcite , which required a combination of thermal bremsstrahlung and power law models to describe the spectrum at high energies .",
    "their findings are thus inconsistent with those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and with our own results .    in order to test the validity of their model , we attempted to fit a thermal bremsstrahlung + power law model to our combined pca + hexte spectra in the 3  50 kev range .",
    "while this model provided an acceptable fit , significant residuals were seen at @xmath05 kev indicating that the model does not accurately describe the spectrum . due to the poor statistics in the hexte data above 50 kev",
    "we could not confirm the existence of a tail in the spectrum @xmath17 70 kev .",
    "however , the poor residuals at low energies obtained with the combined thermal bremsstrahlung / power law model raises questions about the presence of a high energy tail in the spectrum from this system .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite also found an acceptable fit to the spectrum using a single power law model without the inclusion of a high energy exponential cut - off .    additionally , in other binary systems",
    "the appearance of a high energy tail has been linked to the onset of compact jets .",
    "radio observations of 2s 0114 + 650 performed in the 240  1400 mhz range with the giant metrewave radio telescope found no evidence for any radio emission , thus arguing against the presence of jets in this system @xcite .      from our analysis of the pca timing data , we have obtained a new value for the pulse period at 2.65 @xmath6 0.003 h. this value is inconsistent with the value reported by @xcite , indicating that the neutron star is continuing to spin - up over time ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "separate analysis of the two observation runs showed no significant difference between the values of the pulse period during the six months separating the runs , providing an upper limit for @xmath18/@xmath19 during mjd 53505  53747 of @xmath20 @xmath21 4.6 @xmath2 10@xmath22 yr@xmath4 .",
    "our results are thus consistent with the value of @xmath232 @xmath2 10@xmath22 yr@xmath4 obtained by @xcite .",
    "our results also indicate that the model proposed by @xcite  which ascribed the @xmath02 h pulse period to tidally - induced pulsations of the b - supergiant companion  is inconsistent with the observed properties of this source .",
    "they showed that tidal oscillations of the companion star s surface could occur at both the @xmath02 h and @xmath030 d timescales .",
    "however , their model predicts that the @xmath02.7 h period should vary significantly on short times - scales between @xmath01.6  3.4 h ( depending on the system parameters ) .",
    "in addition , the link between tidal oscillations of the donor star and periodic mass ejection episodes is still unclear @xcite .",
    "our observations thus indicate that this model does not adequately explain the mechanism behind the pulse period , as the stability of this period has been demonstrated over timescales of days to months .",
    "the pulse profile shown in figure [ pulsea ] is approximately sinusoidal with features around phase 0.2 and 0.85 , with the latter possibly arising from the edge of the emission region at the second pole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the profile of the modulation does not appear to vary significantly with energy , implying an absence of cyclotron scattering ( as any cyclotron features in the spectrum would be expected to vary with the rotation of the magnetic field ;",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supporting the results of our spectral fitting .",
    "in addition , while no clear - cut dependence of the pulse profile on the pulse period is apparent for x - ray pulsars , @xcite noted that many slow pulsars ( p@xmath24 @xmath17 100 s ) show relatively smooth and sinusoidal profiles .",
    "our results thus continue to support a pulsar nature for the compact object in 2s 0114 + 650 .",
    "the approximately sinusoidal profile and the lack of change with energy is consistent with the profiles of other x - ray pulsars with luminosities below @xmath010@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "previous attempts to constrain the distance to 2s 0114 + 650 have yielded a range of values ( 1.8 @xmath6 0.2 kpc , @xmath02.5 kpc , @xmath03.8 kpc , @xmath03 kpc ; * ? ? ?",

    "our analysis of the phase resolved spectra showed marginal evidence for variability in the power law photon index over the pulse period , anti - correlated with the flux . a similar anti - correlation between the photon index and the pulse flux has been observed in her x-1 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the observed similarities between the spectral variability of 2s 0114 + 650 and her x-1 over the pulse periods could thus strengthen the case that the @xmath02.7 h period is indicative of the neutron star spin period .",
    "however , the uncertainties for the photon index values are too large to draw a firm conclusion either way .",
    "no significant correlated variability of the neutral hydrogen column density over the pulse period could be determined .    using the derived values of the wind velocity ( 1,200 km s@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , orbital tangential velocity ( @xmath0271 km s@xmath4 assuming an almost - circular orbit ) , orbital angular velocity ( 6.3 @xmath2 10@xmath25 rad s@xmath4 ) , and typical values for the other parameters @xcite , we calculated the @xmath26 in order to achieve the observed average spin - up rate . the results of these calculations yielded values of @xmath09 @xmath2 10@xmath27 m@xmath28 yr@xmath4 for a neutron star and @xmath02 @xmath2 10@xmath22 m@xmath28 yr@xmath4 for a white dwarf .",
    "the derived mass accretion rate for a neutron star is approximately two orders of magnitude less than the mass loss rate for b1 ia supergiants derived by @xcite from infrared observations and , more recently , by @xcite from optical observations .",
    "the mass accretion rate would be expected to be much less than the mass loss rate of the donor star due to inefficient capture of material from the stellar wind .",
    "our derived mass accretion rate is thus consistent with the expected mass loss rate of the supergiant .",
    "in contrast , the derived mass accretion rate for a white dwarf is three orders of magnitude greater than the expected supergiant mass loss rate , clearly excluding a white dwarf as the compact object in this system . in light of this , the evolution of the pulse period @xcite , and the spectral similarities shared with other binary x - ray pulsars , we conclude that the @xmath02.7 h period must indeed be the spin - period of a neutron star .",
    "the recent reports by @xcite and @xcite of two other candidate pulsars with hour - long spin - periods ( @xmath05 h for 4u 1954 + 319 and @xmath06.7 h for 1e 161348 - 5055.1 respectively )  if confirmed  would appear to indicate that super - slow rotating neutron stars are more prevalent than originally suspected .",
    "@xcite has shown that the assumption of a super - critical initial magnetic field strength ( i.e. @xmath29 g ) is not necessary if the propeller phase consisted of both supersonic and subsonic propeller phases .",
    "rapid spin - down would occur over very short timescales due to interactions between the accreting material and the neutron star magnetic field . in this setting , even spherical accretion from a stellar wind would result in significant angular momentum transfer due to the orbital motion of the neutron star @xcite , leading to spin - down timescales consistent with the projected lifetime of the donor star .",
    "@xcite showed that in the davies - fabian - pringle @xcite scenario a mass accretion rate of @xmath010@xmath30 g s@xmath4 is required to spin 2s 0114 + 650 down to a period of @xmath010@xmath31 s. this derived accretion rate is a factor of 30 smaller than the current mass transfer rate inferred from the x - ray luminosity of the source .",
    "however , the evolutionary tracks of massive stars predict a main sequence o9.5 v progenitor star for a b1 ia supergiant in a previous epoch @xcite , with a mass outflow rate of 30  40 times smaller than the donor star in 2s 0114 + 650 inferred from optical observations .",
    "hence , the mass accretion rate in a previous ( spin - down ) epoch would be @xmath010@xmath30 g s@xmath4 , consistent with the value required by the davies - fabian - pringle scenario .",
    "the problem common to both the @xcite and @xcite scenarios is that the equilibrium period for 2s 0114 + 650 is predicted to be @xmath20 26 min , which the spin - period will rapidly approach on timescales of @xmath32 100 yr for disc accretion and @xmath32 1,000 yr for stellar wind accretion @xcite .",
    "the probability of observing the pulsar in 2s 0114 + 650 during the long - period phase is thus almost negligible , indicating either 2s 0114 + 650 is a young accretor ( and we have beaten all the odds to observe it in this stage ) or our current understanding of pulsar evolution is deficient .",
    "if the pulse period continues to decrease at the current average rate of @xmath232 @xmath2 10@xmath22 yr@xmath4 @xcite , the pulsar will reach its equilibrium period in @xmath20 400 yr .",
    "this timescale is thus consistent with an infant x - ray pulsar spinning - up through stellar wind accretion .",
    "the observed variability of the neutral hydrogen column density over the orbital period indicates that variable absorption by the dense stellar wind throughout the orbit is the mechanism behind the orbital modulation , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar variability in the column density has been observed in the hmxb pulsars vela x-1 and exo 1722 - 363 @xcite .",
    "the latter system in particular provides a good comparison , as both the column density and the power law photon index were observed to vary over the orbital period , anti - correlated with flux ( see figure [ exopi ] for a plot of the photon index over orbital phase from the data presented in * ? ? ?",
    ". exo 1722 - 363 is a highly obscured binary system that exhibits regular eclipses .",
    "the observed increase in the column density and photon index during eclipse are thus a result of absorption effects .",
    "it is not possible to determine from our results whether accretion in an unperturbed stellar wind is sufficient to account for the observed changes in the column density .",
    "thus , we can not determine whether structures such as accretion wakes ( similar to those detected in vela x-1 and exo 1722 - 363 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are required to account for the observed absorption .",
    "however , the shape of the column density variations with orbital phase is consistent with an undisturbed wind , and not like the highly disturbed wind models obtained from simulations ( see figures 2 and 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "further observations and modelling are required before the geometry of the wind can be constrained .",
    "while our results do not exclude periodic eclipses of the neutron star by the supergiant companion , we found no strong evidence for eclipses in the pca light curves .",
    "we thus conclude that 2s 0114 + 650 does not exhibit the properties of an eclipsing binary system as suggested by @xcite . however , the similarities between the spectral variability in 2s 0114 + 650 and exo 1722 - 363 hint at similarities in the orbital properties .",
    "we thus ascribe the observed spectral variability to 2s 0114 + 650 passing behind a heavily absorbing region close to the base of the wind of the donor star .",
    "her x-1 is the prototypical system in which the warped , precessing disc scenario has been shown to explain the observed super - orbital modulation very well . the column density in this system",
    "has been observed to vary out of phase with the super - orbital cycle , due to variable obscuration of the central source by the precessing disc warp @xcite .",
    "the lack of variability of the column density over the super - orbital period in 2s 0114 + 650 thus indicates that this modulation is not due to local changes in the column density , and therefore precludes variable absorption by a warped , precessing accretion disc as the cause of the super - orbital modulation .",
    "the lack of significant fe k@xmath7 emission precludes variable reflection by a precessing disc , as strong iron emission due to reprocessing of x - rays in a disc would be expected to be present and variable in this scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the apparent increase in the power law photon index during the super - orbital minimum is in exact opposition to the behaviour of two of the other well studied super - orbital systems ",
    "lmc x-4 and her x-1 @xcite  both of which exhibit photon index variability modulated over the super - orbital period . in both of these systems",
    "the super - orbital modulation is attributed to the warped precessing disc model , once again showing that the 30.75 d period in 2s 0114 + 650 does not fit the standard model .",
    "if the super - orbital modulation was tied to accretion onto another compact object ( i.e. a triple system ) , we would expect to see variability of the column density and possibly the photon index in a similar fashion to the orbital mechanism discussed above . while modulation of the eccentricity of the 11.6 d orbit by a third massive body would not lead to variability in the column density",
    ", this model would yield a long - period of @xmath15 30.75 d.    similarly , if precession of the neutron star - spin axis were the cause of the super - orbital modulation , the precession period would be inversely proportional to the spin period @xcite .",
    "we would thus expect to see the super - orbital period vary , anti - correlated with the spin - up of the neutron star .",
    "the apparent long - term stability of this period as shown by @xcite indicates that this latter scenario is unlikely .",
    "in addition , the expected precession period for a neutron star spinning with a @xmath02.7 hr period is @xmath15 30.75 d.    the periodic episodes of enhanced mass accretion in the tidally - driven oscillation model proposed by @xcite would not be expected to cause column density variability .",
    "@xcite analysed 1,250 photographic plates taken of 2s 0114 + 650 between 1928 and 1977 at optical wavelengths and could not discern any significant variability in the optical magnitude greater than 0.3 mag over any timescale .",
    "pulsations in the supergiant donor star should result in significant variable optical luminosity thus making this scenario unlikely .",
    "however , it should be noted that no long - term optical monitoring has been performed since 1999 when the super - orbital period was first detectable in the asm data , preventing us from ruling out this model as an explanation for the super - orbital variability .",
    "another possibility is that the neutron star undergoes periods of enhanced accretion over the super - orbital timescale due to the presence of another donor star in an eccentric orbit of @xmath030 d. as the second donor star approaches periastron passage , accretion onto the neutron star would commence through roche lobe overflow .",
    "the increase in flux over the super - orbital period would thus be due to phase dependent episodes of roche lobe overflow , which would be associated with the formation of a transient disc during very specific super - orbital phases .",
    "this would result in an increase in the accretion rate and therefore an increase in flux , but would not necessarily result in variability of the observed spectral parameters .",
    "previous optical observations have identified only one candidate for the optical counterpart within the x - ray error circle .",
    "if the super - orbital modulation is due to the presence of a second donor star in a triple system , the third star would have to be low - mass with very low luminosity .",
    "pseudo - periodic flaring episodes were observed around @xmath01,300 s at the maximum pulse phase , with the recurrence timescale of these flares seen to vary significantly over time .",
    "no evidence for a correlation between the flare recurrence timescales and either the orbital or super - orbital period flux was found . when taken into context with the 894 , 850 and @xmath02,000 s periods previously reported by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite respectively and the x - ray flickering reported by @xcite",
    ", we conclude that the observed @xmath01,300 s flares are most likely due to an aperiodic process with a stochastic recurrence timescale .",
    "possible explanations include `` clumping '' of the material in the accretion stream due to turbulent processes , or possibly feedback between the radiation pressure from the emission region and the accreting material .",
    "both explanations imply a correlation between the flare recurrence timescales and the mass accretion rate .",
    "we have performed an extensive study of the x - ray variability of 2s 0114 + 650 with the @xmath10 satellite . the good spectral coverage provided by the pca and hexte instruments",
    "have allowed us to undertake the first in - depth wide - band study of the super - orbital modulation . the overall x - ray spectrum in the 3  50 kev range was found to be well described by the standard absorbed power law model with a high energy exponential cut - off , with spectral parameters consistent with those reported by other authors from other instruments and epochs .",
    "marginal evidence for variability in the power law photon index over the pulse period was identified , which could be attributed to the varying viewing geometry of the accretion region with the spin of the neutron star .",
    "similar variability has been observed from other x - ray pulsars such as her x-1 , supporting the conclusion that 2s 0114 + 650 contains a super - slow x - ray pulsar .",
    "the near - sinusoidal pulse profile and the lack of change with energy puts 2s 0114 + 650 in the class of low luminosity ( @xmath20 10@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 ) x - ray pulsars , allowing us to provide a new distance estimate of 4.5 @xmath6 1.5 kpc .",
    "variability of the neutral hydrogen column density over the orbital period was observed , indicating that the line - of - sight motion of the neutron star through the dense circumstellar environment is the mechanism behind the orbital modulation . additional variability in the power law photon index anti - correlated with flux over the orbital period was identified , which we speculate is due to absorption effects as the neutron star passes behind a heavily absorbing region near the base of the supergiant companion s wind .",
    "in contrast , no significant variability of the column density was observed over the super - orbital period .",
    "while super - orbital periods are commonly attributed to variable obscuration by a precessing warp in an accretion disc , the absence of super - orbital column density variability indicates that this is not the mechanism behind the super - orbital modulation .",
    "similarly , the absence of significant iron emission or reflection components in the spectrum argues against variable reflection by a precessing warped disc . while the slope of the spectrum was relatively stable throughout the super - orbital cycle , a significant increase in the photon index",
    "was observed during the minimum phase .",
    "we conclude that the super - orbital period is tied to variability in the mass accretion rate due to some as yet unidentified mechanism .",
