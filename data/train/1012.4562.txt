    "there are only two features of the cosmic ray energy spectrum which depart from smoothness : the knee at a few pev and the ankle at a few eev .",
    "the origin of both is still subject to argument .",
    "here we examine the first feature .",
    "the knee , a comparatively sudden change of slope - a steepening - has been known since the pioneering work of kulikov and khristianssen @xcite .",
    "most workers have attributed it to the rather sudden reduction in galactic trapping efficiency , the trapping being confinement by the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the different atomic nuclei will have cut - offs at z - dependent energies and , when summed , the result will be a rather smooth ( not sharp ) change in the spectral slope ; we term this the galactic modulation , gm , model .",
    "a minority of workers have gone along with our idea of the knee being due to a single , recent , local supernova remnant ( snr ) ( @xcite and later publications ) this is the single source model ( ssm ) .",
    "yet another , recent , model has been put forward by hu et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( to be referred to as i ) in which particles from a rapidly rotating pulsar interact with radiation from the parent snr .",
    "we refer to this model as psnr .",
    "the aim of the present work is to follow up our earlier work ( @xcite ) , ( to be referred to as ii ) in which we examined the psnr model as originally proposed in i to see if the knee caused by the particle -snr photon interactions was a universal property of all pulsar , snr pairs .",
    "we found that it was not but that there was hope for a single rare pair having the required properties .",
    "this would be identified as the single source of the ssm although the mechanism would differ from that in the original ssm which involved snr alone . here",
    "we examine the needed properties of the pulsar , snr pair in more detail .",
    "as remarked already , the philosophy of the source process is a composite pulsar - snr system with the pulsar - accelerated particles interacting with the photon field of the snr . under certain circumstances",
    "a sharp knee will result due to particle , photon @xmath1 e@xmath2e@xmath3 interactions .",
    "we start by examining the general properties of the interaction in terms of the mean energy of the photons .",
    "an important characteristic of the knee in the energy spectrum is its sharpness , @xmath4 .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and define the sharpness as @xmath5 figure [ fig1 ] sets the scene for the attenuation length , @xmath6 , of protons and iron interacting with black body photons .",
    "the energy density of the photons is 1  ev  @xmath7 for all but the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , where it is the usual 0.24  ev  @xmath7 .",
    "the minimum range is inversely proportional to the mean photon energy , @xmath8 .",
    "( 1 ev corresponds to @xmath9  k , ie a mean wavelength of 12,400  ) .",
    "we note that the middle of the visible range , yellow light , has wavelength @xmath10  @xmath11 ie a mean energy of 2.48  ev .",
    "the effect of the photon field on the energy spectrum of the emerging particles depends on the energy density of the photons at the time of their passage through the field , for a low energy density there is no effect and for a high energy density the interactions are catastrophic , with no particles emerging . as an illustration , with the object of finding @xmath4-values in the required range",
    "we choose a combination of energy density and trapping time such as to give the minimum @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath12  ev ( @xmath13  cm ) .",
    "this must be equal to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the energy density at time @xmath16 .",
    "the limits , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are discussed in the next section . so as to maximise the psnr effect we choose the smallest value of @xmath17 and the largest @xmath18 permissible .",
    "the lower limit to the interaction time , @xmath17 , is set by energy losses by the pulsar - accelerated particles on the environmental gas density .",
    "this latter is enhanced very considerably by the ejecta from the sn ; it is this material , too , that obscures the optical radiation for a period of days . for a typical massive progenitor of a type ii sn ( and a magnetar )",
    "the mass ejected is of order 5  @xmath19 @xcite the expansion velocity at short times after the expansion can be found by reference to model calculations only ; a commonly quoted value is @xmath20 some support for a value of this order comes from [ 5a ] , who measured c/30 some 30 years after the expansion of a shell remnant ( 43.31 , + 592 ) in messier 82 .",
    "if the density of the ejecta were constant , an attenuation length for protons of 120  g @xmath21 would be achieved in @xmath22  s , neglecting the 1sm swept up .",
    "if concentrated in a thin shell the time needed would be @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , there will be considerable clumpiness , reducing this time by at least an order of magnitude ; indeed , observations of ( much older ) snr show very variable densities . here , as a rather extreme limit ( a factor 30 smaller ) we adopt @xmath24  s. a measure of support comes from the fact that , occasionally amongst the very many snr light curves one encounters ` light break through ' at such early times .    turning to the maximum time , @xmath18 , its",
    "derivation is easier .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig1 ] shows that for a photon temperature of 1ev and an energy density of 1  ev  @xmath7 , interactions will cease when r @xmath25 cm .",
    "this can be converted to an appropriate radius for the environment of a snr of known total photon energy and its time dependence.the highest energy output achievable is @xmath26  erg  s  @xmath27 @xcite yielding in 10@xmath28  s : @xmath29  erg .",
    "we now come to an important problem : the extent to which the pulsar - accelerated particles are trapped in the remnant before escaping .",
    "alternatives are adopted here :    * the particles are trapped by the tangled magnetic fields and diffuse out with the remnant ( model 1 ) and * the particles are not trapped but stream out from the pulsar with the speed of light ( model 2 )    predictions will be made for each case and then common problems will be addressed .",
    "snr commonly expand at a velocity of @xmath20 as already remarked and an expansion time of @xmath30  s yields a radius of @xmath31  cm . assuming that the cr are trapped in the remnant for this time the required total distance traveled for the photon energy achieved corresponds to @xmath32  cm for 1  ev  @xmath7 .",
    "the energy density for our remnant follows as @xmath33  ev  @xmath7",
    ".    to summarise : our ( rather extreme ) limits are @xmath34  s and @xmath35  s ; the corresponding snr radii are 10@xmath36  cm and @xmath31  cm",
    ".      calculations have been made using the above parameters , for protons in the first instance .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , for both the spectral reduction factors , @xmath37 , and sharpness values , @xmath4 . in order to study the sensitivity to the mean photon energy ,",
    "the calculations are made for both @xmath12  ev and 2  ev .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath4-values are upper limits in that we ignore the particles which are accelerated after the interactions with the snr - photons have effectively ceased .",
    "such particles will dilute the knee and reduce @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] gives the corresponding plots for helium ; it will be seen that the @xmath4-values are rather similar - the main difference being , as expected , in the energy at which @xmath4 is a maximum .      inspection of figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] shows that the energies for @xmath38 are , for protons : @xmath39(p ) : 0.31 pev ( 1  ev ) and 0.15  pev ( 2  ev ) and for helium nuclei : @xmath39(he ) : 1.2 pev ( 1  ev ) and 0.62  pev ( 2  ev )    the ratio of the energies for @xmath38 for helium and protons are seen to be @xmath40 , as would be expected since it is energy per nucleus that is important in determining the threshold energy for photon , particle interactions .",
    "comparison can now be made with experiment .",
    "the energy of the knee in the cr energy spectrum is model - dependant and values range from about 3  8 pev .",
    "there is evidence that helium nuclei predominate at the knee @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if so , there is clearly a factor 10 difference in the @xmath38-energies , between observed and expected , for @xmath8 = 1  ev .",
    "a value nearer @xmath8 = 0.1  ev ( wavelength @xmath41  : for infra - red ) is required .",
    "this is a serious drawback for model i.      figure  [ fig4 ] shows the situation where @xmath8 is reduced to 0.13 ev so that the proton knee ( peak ) is now at @xmath39(p ) @xmath42 2 pev .",
    "the helium knee ( peak ) is at @xmath39(he ) @xmath43 7.8 pev .",
    "both can be regarded as , perhaps , just acceptable .",
    "two aspects need consideration , now .",
    "the first concerns the position of the iron knee ( peak ) , at 100 pev .",
    "this is close to the 70 pev where recent work @xcite gives rather strong evidence for a peak from an analysis of the results from the eas arrays .",
    "this is a good feature of the model .",
    "the second relates to the need for @xmath44 0.13  ev ; with the conversion 1 ev corresponds to @xmath9  k , the effective temperature is in the region of 1,500 k , ie in the infrared , as already remarked .",
    "although there is , inevitably , an infrared flux , from visible radiation absorbed by the snr material , its intensity is too low to give sufficient energy density for our purpose .      inevitably , the temperature of the remnant will fall with time and a reduction of @xmath4 will occur .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the situation for the likely case of a conventional snr ( eg @xcite ) where the temperature falls by a factor 2 over the operative period of particle - photon interactions .",
    "interestingly , although finite , the reduction in @xmath4 is not large .",
    "however , for more dramatic snr , such as are required here , the change in temperature can be much bigger .",
    "in @xcite temperatures versus time are given for the following progenitors : red supergiants , blue supergiants and wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the ratios of @xmath8(@xmath45  s ) to @xmath8(@xmath30  s ) are , respectively , ( for typical stars within these types ) : 7.1 , 8.4 and 8.4 .",
    "the exponents of the power laws are -0.56 , -0.61 and -0.61 .",
    "it is true that the luminosity falls with time , too , but with much smaller exponents : -0.17 , -0.35 and -0.35 . in consequence ,",
    "the reduction in @xmath4 in practice for snr from such progenitors will be much smaller than shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .    for young magnetars , potential sn for the mechanism considered here ,",
    "the light curves are a rather strong function of the magnetic field of the magnetar and often continue for hundreds of days @xcite .",
    "predictions are not available for the short period from sn birth ( 0.3 to 10 days ) needed here so that conclusions can not be drawn .    in summary",
    ", falling temperatures appear not to be a problem for the model .",
    "inspection of many published snr ` luminosity curves ' shows a rather wide spread but figure  [ fig6]a shows the general form , for the case where the absorption by the snr shell material is only 10% .",
    "figure  [ fig6]b shows the light curve for an absorption of 50% .",
    "the parameter for the lines is the ` cooling time ' , i.e. the mean exponential decay time of the radiation .    calculations have been made by us for a variety of values for the absorption efficiency , the cooling time and the time over which the source is active ( the ` source activity time').demanding that the sharpness should exceed s=2 gives the results shown in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "it will be noted that there is a minimum cooling time of 40 days and the source activity time must be greater than about 30@xmath46 days .",
    "a number of parameters need examination , principally :    the masses needed for injection , + the total photon energy , + the products of the photon - nucleus interactions and , most importantly , + the characteristics needed for the pulsar .",
    "+    these parameters will be considered , in turn .",
    "it is apparent that the masses of nuclei needed : protons , helium , iron ( ? ) are not expected as products of pulsar acceleration .",
    "rather , proton - rich or iron - rich neutron - star surface elements would be expected .",
    "although not an impossible situation , the needed composition does not add confidence to the model .",
    "the total photon energy in the photon field adopted ( which we assume effectively ceases after @xmath30  s ) is @xmath47  erg . to this",
    "should be added the later energy - which is the energy seen after the obscuration has ceased , but here we ignore this component which should not be large .",
    "the value can be compared with the total energy released in a typical sn : about @xmath48 erg , of which perhaps @xmath49 erg appears in visible light @xcite .",
    "thus , the energetics are acceptable .",
    "if the whole of the cr spectrum were due to the psnr mechanism then the overall change of slope of the primary cr spectrum would correspond to a transfer of energy from cr particles to gamma rays , via the electron pairs generated in the particle - snr photon interaction .",
    "inspection of the cr spectrum shows that the energy density of galactic gamma rays would be about @xmath50 ev @xmath7 , a value comparable with that detected in the diffuse gamma radiation , the latter usually being attributable to cr particles interacting with gas in the ism",
    ". such a situation would be dangerous for the model but probably not catastrophic . in the more likely situation ( in our view )",
    "that it is only the single source that produces the knee then copious gamma ray fluxes will have been produced soon after the interaction ( some few 10@xmath51 y ago ? ) .",
    "however , it is likely that these gamma rays will have been and gone by now .",
    "the conclusion is that the non - observation of the gamma rays associated with the p - snr interactions does not pose a threat to the model .",
    "the first characteristic is that the pulsar should be able to accelerate particles to rigidities of some 10pev .",
    "@xcite gives the expression @xmath52 where b@xmath53 is the magnetic field in 10@xmath54  gauss , p is the period in seconds and v is the rigidity in volts . if we need r@xmath55 then , for b@xmath56 ( the mean , from model a of @xcite ) a period of 45  ms is required .",
    "interestingly , this is not too far from the birth period in the same model , which has p = 23  ms .",
    "the problem here is the likely age of pulsars of such characteristics . using the work of @xcite again ,",
    "this is given by @xmath57    such a time ( 1000  y ) would be far too long to satify the requirements of figure  [ fig3 ] ( where the cooling time is unlikely to be longer than @xmath43 100  d.    pulsars of much shorter period are required , for example , @xmath58  ms and , say , @xmath59 , for which @xmath60  days .",
    "normal pulsars ( lorimer , model a , @xcite ) have a standard deviation about the mean of @xmath61 and will have a similar standard deviation for period @xcite , thus they will not satisfy the bill , even to the extent of 3 standard deviations from the mean .",
    "magnetars @xcite would , at first sight , appear to satisfy the requirements .",
    "they have extremely high magnetic fields , typically @xmath62  g but , when measured , their periods are of order seconds . in @xcite",
    "a theory is developed for the evolution of magnetars , in which the important birth period is in the range 10 - 740  ms , with a mean of 161ms .",
    "however , the mean field is given by @xmath63 clearly , the @xmath8-value will be , again , too long . another factor militating against a magnetar as being the local pulsar responsible for the knee ( and the electron results )",
    "is the fact that their birth rate is quoted as @xmath64 ( @xcite ) furthermore none is in our vicinity ; the catalogue , @xcite , gives the nearest as being some 3.5kpc away .",
    "in fact the most likely nearby snr for the single source is a conventional one : monogem @xcite .",
    "that the suggested psnr mechanism is very unlikely to work for even a single , rare object is provided by the following facts .    * the losses of energy by the pulsar - accelerated particles in collision with the very early snr ejecta",
    "is expected to be very great . in our calculations we assumed that the ejecta was clumpy enough to allow such passage but this appears highly unlikely . * for both models considered here the source activity time is far too long for any known type of pulsar to be responsible ; cr particles emitted after the snr illumination has ceased will dilute the spectral sharpness to an unacceptable degree .",
    "this is intrinsic in model 1 and , for model 2 , can be seen directly in figure [ fig7];for a typical cooling time of 100 d the pulsar must be active for less than a year . * even if an ultra - rare pulsar of the required characteristics was proposed , the probability of its being close enough ( and its contemporary presence undetected ) is remote in the extreme . *",
    "the mass composition of the ambient cr in general and the simgle source in particular are quite different from what would be expected from a pulsar .",
