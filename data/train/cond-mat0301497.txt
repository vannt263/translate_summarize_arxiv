    "the magnetic molecules [ mn@xmath0o@xmath0(ch@xmath6coo)@xmath7(h@xmath8o)@xmath9@xmath102ch@xmath6cooh@xmath104h@xmath8o , abbreviated mn@xmath0-ac @xcite , and [ ( c@xmath11h@xmath12n@xmath6)@xmath11fe@xmath1(@xmath13-o)@xmath8(@xmath14-oh)@xmath0]br@xmath16(h@xmath8o)br@xmath108h@xmath8o , in short fe@xmath1br@xmath1 @xcite , have been the focus of extensive studies since it was discovered that they exhibit the rare phenomenon of macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) @xcite .",
    "as has now been well established @xcite , both of these compounds have a net total spin s = 10 , and can be grown as high quality single crystals @xcite .",
    "the evidence for mqt consisted of the following observations : ( a ) below a certain temperature , known as the blocking temperature , t@xmath17 ( 2.7 k for mn@xmath0-ac and 1 k for fe@xmath1br@xmath1 ) , their magnetic hysteresis loops exhibited sharp steps at regular intervals ( about 0.46 tesla ( t ) for mn@xmath0-ac , and 0.24 t for fe@xmath1br@xmath1 ) , when the field was applied along the easy axes @xcite , and ( b ) the magnetization relaxation rate became temperature independent at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this quantized hysteretic behavior was found also for very dilute samples , such as frozen into organic solvents @xcite .",
    "this observation implies that the hysteresis loop is a property of every single molecule , rather than that of a macroscopic domain , hence they have been described as single molecule magnets ( smm s ) @xcite .",
    "it can thus be expected that these smm s hold the potential for becoming an integral part of a molecular - size memory device@xcite .",
    "mn@xmath0-ac has also been proposed as a potential candidate for a quantum computing element@xcite .    to advance our understanding of these materials for possible applications ,",
    "it is important to understand their electrical conductivity behavior .",
    "although these materials appear to be insulating , they are single crystalline materials with a unique configuration of large molecular units containing transition metal ions and polarizable subunits , nested in a bridging network",
    ". one might thus expect some sort of semiconducting behavior , albeit with high resistivity .",
    "interestingly , information about the electrical conductivity is not yet available for either compound , despite the fact that mn@xmath0-ac and fe@xmath1br@xmath1 have been studied by dielectric relaxation @xcite , far - infrared absorption under applied magnetic fields @xcite , raman scattering @xcite , micro - hall techniques @xcite , micro - squid magnetometry @xcite , epr @xcite , nmr @xcite , specific heat@xcite and magnetization measurements @xcite , neutron scattering @xcite , and optical absorption @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that from optical absorption measurements oppenheimer _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have deduced optical excitation band gaps , @xmath5 , of 1.1 and 1.75 ev for the minority ( inner tetrahedron ) and majority ( crown ) spin systems in mn@xmath0-ac , respectively .",
    "these values were considered comparable with corresponding theoretical estimates of 0.45 and 2.08 ev by pederson and khanna @xcite and of 0.85 and 1.10 ev by zeng _",
    "_ @xcite . in the present investigation",
    "we have carried out electrical conductivity measurements on single crystals of both mn@xmath0-ac and fe@xmath1br@xmath1 over the temperature range of 77 k to 300 k. confirmatory measurements were made using _ ac _",
    "dielectric techniques .",
    "the results show that both compounds exhibit fairly clear semiconducting behavior ( 200 - 300 k ) with distinctly different transport activation energies .",
    "it should be noted that in an intrinsic semiconductor , the activation energy ( or gap ) measured via conductivity is to be compared with 1/2 @xmath5 , and thus for mn@xmath0-ac the agreement with the optical data are satisfactory .",
    "we also describe photoconductivity over the visible range and x - ray damage investigations on mn@xmath0-ac to further probe the nature of electrical transport in these materials .",
    "the measured photoconductivity exhibits a significant wavelength dependence .",
    "long black rectangular crystals of mn@xmath0-ac were synthesized following the procedure of lis @xcite .",
    "the crystals typically grew to dimensions of about 0.6 x 0.6 x 2.8 mm@xmath18 .",
    "high quality single crystals of fe@xmath1br@xmath1 were prepared by the method described in the literature @xcite .",
    "the fe@xmath1br@xmath1 crystals grew as dark brown orthorhombic plates of about 4.0 x 6.0 x 0.5 mm@xmath18 .",
    "the samples have been routinely monitored for quality by nmr , x - ray diffraction , and magnetization measurements .",
    "_ dc _ resistance measurements were conducted under either a constant voltage or a constant current mode using a conventional four probe technique . a high input impedance ( 2@xmath19 ohm ) electrometer",
    "was used to measure the voltage drop across the sample when constant current was applied .",
    "currents were typically in the 0.1 to 10 na range , and voltages were generally 100 v or less .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics were periodically checked to verify ohmic behavior .",
    "_ ac _ conductance measurements were made with a standard _",
    "ac _ impedance bridge technique .",
    "a capacitive electrode configuration was made by painting two flat parallel surfaces of a sample with conductive ( silver or graphite ) paste .",
    "the capacitive and dissipative signals were detected by a lock - in amplifier with an excitation frequency of about 8 khz . in all cases",
    "the measurements were made under vacuum in a temperature controlled probe .",
    "photoconductivity measurements were made on mn@xmath0-ac using a he - ne laser for red ( 632.8 nm ) and argon laser for blue ( 488 nm ) and green ( 514 nm ) light .",
    "the light intensity was calibrated before each measurement .",
    "photocurrent was measured using a lock - in amplifier while the sample was under _ direct current _ bias and illuminated by chopped light .",
    "a more detailed description of the experiment is published elsewhere@xcite . for the x - ray experiments ,",
    "mn@xmath0-ac crystals were irradiated with 40 kv , 40 ma , cu @xmath20 radiation at room temperature in order to observe the effects of defects .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistance @xmath21 of a mn@xmath0-ac sample is shown in fig . [ temp](a ) for a 4-terminal , constant current configuration .",
    "the resistivity values are on the order of @xmath22 @xmath23 cm at room temperature , and increase rapidly in an activated manner upon cooling .",
    "below about 200 k , ohmic equilibrium is lost due to the high resistance values .",
    "thus the arrhenius analysis was limited to temperatures above this temperature . over the 200 - 300 k range ,",
    "@xmath24 exhibits a linear dependence as a function of 1/t as shown in the inset , characteristic of a semiconducting system with a well defined band gap where @xmath25 , and @xmath2 is the thermal activation energy . from the slopes of curves of the inset",
    ", @xmath2 is estimated to be 0.38 @xmath3 0.05 ev .",
    "[ temp](b ) shows the temperature dependence of the current for the constant voltage ( 50 v ) bias condition . as the resistance of the sample increases with decreasing temperature , the current rapidly decreases , and is unmeasurable below @xmath26 210 k. the corresponding @xmath24 vs @xmath27 curve is shown in the inset .",
    "the linear dependence yields a value of @xmath2 = 0.36 @xmath3 0.05 ev .",
    "[ bridge ] shows the @xmath24 vs @xmath27 curve of a mn@xmath0-ac sample obtained by the impedance bridge technique .",
    "the sample was cooled from room temperature to 200 k. the solid line corresponds to @xmath2 = 0.36 @xmath3 0.05 ev .",
    "the resistance again shows activated behavior but the linear relation is not so clear as in the _ dc _ resistance case .",
    "a significant observation was that the mn@xmath0-ac crystals lose solvent upon heating above 300 k. one sample was heated to 350 k and then cooled down to 200 k. the plot of @xmath24 vs @xmath27 yielded two separate straight lines as can be noted from fig .",
    "the activation energy at the higher temperature range was 0.35 @xmath3 0.05 ev , while the @xmath2 was 0.18 @xmath3 0.05 ev for the lower temperatures , after heating .",
    "thus , care must be taken not to heat the samples above 300 k or so .",
    "photoconductivity ( pc ) was measured on mn@xmath0-ac using the _ ac _ component of the photocurrent for chopped laser light illumination .",
    "this was done by biasing the sample with different values of _ dc _ current @xcite .",
    "[ photo ] shows the dependence of the pc on the intensity ( power ) of the laser radiation at the three wavelengths used , 632.8 nm ( red ) , 514 nm ( green ) , and 488 nm ( blue ) .",
    "pc is seen to increase with photon energy .",
    "the increase is about a factor of eight when going from 632.8 nm to 488 nm .",
    "clearly this enhancement must relate to the creation of charge carriers by the photons , or to the increase in temperature due to light absorption , or both .",
    "a simple thermal mechanism is not supported by the earlier uv - visible absorption data of oppenheimer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on mn@xmath0-ac .",
    "the spectra show a gradual increase in absorption with photon energy and the absorption edge was estimated to be about 1.1 ev",
    ". however , over the 632.8 to 488 nm range , the absorption was nearly ( within a factor of two ) constant , while the pc increases by a factor of eight .",
    "these considerations argue against a major role of thermal heating in the mechanism of the observed pc enhancement . the effect is thus ascribed to an enhancement of charge carriers due to optical absorption .      recently , hernandez _ et al . _ @xcite observed an increase in the magnetization tunneling rate of mn@xmath0-ac caused by defects in the lattice as a result of x - ray irradiation and heat treatments . in order to probe the possible role of defects in the transport properties of mn@xmath0-ac ,",
    "we have also carried out an x - ray irradiation study . as the irradiation dose was increased from 2 hr to 20 hrs , the overall resistivity of the sample increased , but a plot of @xmath24 vs @xmath27 for the different exposure times showed the activation energies remained fairly constant .",
    "the radiation - induced defects thus seem to act as trapping sites for the carriers .",
    "this effect is further discussed in section iv .",
    "preliminary temperature dependent conductivity measurements have also been carried out on single crystals of fe@xmath1br@xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fe8res ] shows a typical @xmath28 vs. @xmath27 plot .",
    "the slope of the line yields a value of @xmath2 = 0.73 @xmath3 0.1 ev , which is seen to be significantly higher than that of mn@xmath0-ac ( 0.37 @xmath3 0.05 ev ) .",
    "this is discussed later in terms of the bonding of fe@xmath1br@xmath1 and mn@xmath0-ac .",
    "at present no optical data are available for fe@xmath1br@xmath1 for comparison with the conductivity measurements .",
    "table i summarizes the conductivity results in comparison to the optical data @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "the main result of this study of the electrical transport in these smm - type single crystalline materials is that they exhibit thermally activated conductivity characteristic of a gapped semiconductor over the range of 200 - 300 k. photoconductivity measurements also support their description as gapped semiconductors .",
    "however , the precise nature of the carrier transport is difficult to determine , since generally measurements over many orders of magnitude in temperature are necessary to establish the functional dependence of @xmath21 . in order to understand the conduction pathway , we examined the connectivity between the neighboring mn@xmath0-ac and fe@xmath1br@xmath1 clusters . figures [ mn12 ] and [ fe8 ] show several transport scenarios are possible .",
    "first , as a result of the crystalline lattice , one can expect that there will be a band structure with gaps . at present , only the electronic structure of the clusters has been computed@xcite . for a band - gapped semiconductor ,",
    "one expects the resistivity to vary as @xmath29 , where @xmath2 is related to the optical gap @xmath5 by @xmath30@xcite .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the crystal structure , it is possible that impurities and/or disorder play significant roles in the charge transport .",
    "for example , thermally activated hopping between impurity sites can also give similar temperature dependence .",
    ".comparison of @xmath5 from conductivity and optical data , and theoretical calculations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if conduction is through a distribution of impurity sites , variable range hopping ( vrh ) should dominate .",
    "however , the following considerations argue against a vrh behavior .",
    "furthermore , the resistivity ( @xmath31 @xmath23 cm ) is very high for a typical vrh conduction system@xcite . moreover , application of the mott formula for vhr ( @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , where d is the dimensionality ) yielded t@xmath34 @xmath35 3@xmath36 k ( for d=3 ) .",
    "the high sensitivity of the vrh model to defects can be tested by introducing them artificially , by ion implantation , or in the present case , by x - ray irradiation . since the @xmath37 values obtained from the mott formula indicate an extremely small density of impurity sites , i.e. @xmath38 , a small number of additional defects should decrease @xmath37 significantly .",
    "however , our experimental results on irradiated samples ( sec . iii.c . ) indicate that @xmath37 and @xmath2 are insensitive to the creation of defects .",
    "hence the x - ray investigation supports the idea of intrinsic semiconductor - like conduction in mn@xmath0-ac , and by inference , also for fe@xmath1br@xmath1 .",
    "while we have not been able to arrive at any detailed picture of the conduction pathways , we offer the following possibilities based on the structure and bonding characteristics of both lattices .",
    "the pathway for mn@xmath0-ac is based upon simple coulombic interactions between mn@xmath39 ions , and the polar molecules which lie between two mn@xmath0-ac clusters .",
    "a water molecule bound to a mn@xmath39 on the outer crown lies 2.67 @xmath40 away from an unbound acetate ligand , which is , in turn , 2.77 @xmath40 away from a symmetrically equivalent , unbound acetate ligand adjacent to the closest mn@xmath0-ac cluster as seen in figure [ mn12 ] .",
    "the fe@xmath1br@xmath1 conduction pathway is illustrated in figure [ fe8 ] .",
    "the proposed pathway between two fe@xmath1br@xmath1 clusters is through an n - h bond in the 1,4,7-triazacyclononane .",
    "the conduction pathway thus extends from the n - h to a water ( 2.4 @xmath40 ) , to a br@xmath41 ( 2.3 @xmath40 ) , to a water ( 2.1 @xmath40 ) , and finally to a hydrogen ( 2.4 @xmath40 ) directly connected to the 1,4,7-triazacyclononane on the adjacent fe@xmath1br@xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted that the proposed mn@xmath0-ac conduction pathway is much more direct than that for fe@xmath1br@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the higher activation energy found for fe@xmath1br@xmath1 .",
    "we have found that both mn@xmath0-ac and fe@xmath1br@xmath1 exhibit a gapped semiconductor - like behavior in their electrical transport properties . the limited temperature range over which the resistance was measurable , and over which the materials are stable ,",
    "restricts a knowledge of the precise functional form of r(t ) .",
    "nevertheless , complementary photoconductivity and x - ray irradiation studies support a model where the transport is governed by a well - defined energy gap .",
    "the @xmath2 s have been determined to be 0.37 @xmath3 0.05 and 0.73 @xmath3 0.1 ev for mn@xmath0-ac and fe@xmath1br@xmath1 respectively .",
    "assuming an intrinsic semiconducting behavior , they lead to @xmath5 values of 0.74 @xmath3 0.10 ev for mn@xmath0-ac and 1.5 @xmath3 0.2 ev for fe@xmath1br@xmath1 . for mn@xmath0-ac , the agreement is seen to be reasonably good with the optical band gaps for minority ( inner tetrahedron ) spins , and the theoretical estimates by pederson and khanna @xciteas well as zeng _",
    "additional optical and theoretical data are needed for fe@xmath1br@xmath1 . at present , calculations exist only for the molecular band - gaps , but not for the entire lattice .",
    "hence , we can only speculate that the inter - cluster ligand bridges may play an important role in the conduction mechanism .",
    "further computations on the full crystal band structure are thus desirable .",
