    "_ malware _ attacks are a significant threat to networks .",
    "malwares are malicious softwares that include worms , viruses , bots , and spywares .",
    "a fundamental characteristic of malwares is self - propagation , _",
    "i.e. _ , a malware can infect vulnerable hosts and use infected hosts to self - disseminate .",
    "a key component of malware propagation is malware - scanning methods , _",
    "i.e. _ , how effectively and efficiently the malware finds vulnerable targets .",
    "most of the real , especially old worms , such as code red @xcite , slammer @xcite , and latter witty @xcite , exploit naive random scanning .",
    "random scanning chooses target ip addresses uniformly and does not take any information on network structures into consideration .",
    "advanced scanning methods , however , have been developed that exploit the ip address structure .",
    "for example , code red ii and nimda worms have used localized scanning @xcite .",
    "localized scanning preferentially searches for vulnerable hosts in the local sub - network .",
    "the blaster worm has used sequential scanning in addition to localized scanning @xcite .",
    "sequential scanning searches for vulnerable hosts through their closeness in the ip address space .",
    "the agobot has employed a blacklist of the well - known monitored ip address space and avoided scanning these addresses to be stealthy @xcite .",
    "a common characteristic of these malwares is that they scan for vulnerable hosts by taking a certain structure in the ip address space into consideration .",
    "such a structure , as we shall soon show , exhibits network vulnerabilities to defenders and advantages to attackers .    in this paper",
    ", we study the perspective of attackers who attempt to collect the information on network vulnerabilities and design intelligent malwares . by studying this perspective ,",
    "we hope to help defenders better understand and defend against malware propagation . for attackers ,",
    "an open question is how certain information can help them design fast - spreading malwares .",
    "the information may include the vulnerability on end hosts , the number of vulnerable hosts , the locations of detection systems , and the distributions of vulnerable hosts .",
    "this work focuses on vulnerable - host distributions .",
    "the vulnerable - host distributions have been observed to be bursty and spatially inhomogeneous by barford _",
    "a non - uniform distribution of witty - worm victims has been reported by rajab _",
    "a web - server distribution has been found to be non - uniform in the ip address space in our prior work @xcite .",
    "these discoveries suggest that vulnerable hosts and web servers may be  clustered \" ( _ i.e. _ , non - uniform ) .",
    "the clustering / non - uniformity makes the network vulnerable since if one host is compromised in a cluster , the rest may be compromised rather quickly .",
    "therefore , the information on vulnerable - host distributions can be critical for attackers to develop intelligent malwares .",
    "we refer the malwares that exploit the information on highly uneven distributions of vulnerable hosts as _ network - aware _ malwares .",
    "such malwares include aforementioned localized - scanning and sequential - scanning malwares . in our prior work ,",
    "we have studied _ importance - scanning _ malwares @xcite .",
    "specifically , importance scanning provides a ",
    "what - if \" scenario : when there are many ways for network - aware malwares to exploit the information on vulnerable hosts , importance scanning is a worst - case threat - model and can serve as a benchmark for studying real network - aware malwares .",
    "what has been observed is that real network - aware and importance - scanning malwares spread much faster than random - scanning malwares @xcite .",
    "this shows the importance of the problem .",
    "it is not well understood , however , how to characterize the relationship between the information on vulnerable - host distributions and the propagation speed of network - aware malwares .",
    "questions arise .",
    "does there exist a _",
    "characteristic across different vulnerable - host distributions ?",
    "if so , how do network - aware malwares exploit such a vulnerability ?",
    "how can we defend against such malwares ?",
    "our goal is to investigate such a generic characteristic in vulnerable - host distributions , to quantify its relationship with network - aware malwares , and to understand the effectiveness of defense strategies . to achieve this goal",
    ", we investigate network - aware malware attacks in view of information theory , focusing on both the worst - case and real network - aware malwares .",
    "a fundamental concept of information theory is the _ entropy _ that measures the uncertainty of outcomes of a random event .",
    "the reduction of uncertainty is measured by the amount of acquired information .",
    "we apply the _ renyi entropy _ , a generalized entropy @xcite , to analyze the uncertainty of finding vulnerable hosts for different malware - scanning methods .",
    "this would relate malware - attacking methods with the information bits extracted by malwares from the vulnerable - host distribution .",
    "as the first step , we study , from five large - scale measurement sets , the common characteristics of non - uniform vulnerable - host distributions . then , we derive a new metric as the _ non - uniformity factor _ to characterize the non - uniformity of a vulnerable - host distribution .",
    "a larger non - uniformity factor reflects a more non - uniform distribution of vulnerable hosts .",
    "we obtain the non - uniformity factors from the data sets on vulnerable - host distributions and show that all data sets have large non - uniformity factors .",
    "moreover , the non - uniformity factor is a function of the renyi entropies of order two and zero @xcite .",
    "we show that the non - uniformity factor better characterizes the unevenness of a distribution than the shannon entropy . therefore",
    ", in view of information theory , the non - uniformity factor provides a quantitative measure of the unevenness / uncertainty of a vulnerable - host distribution .",
    "next , we relate the generalized entropy with network - aware scanning methods . the class of network - aware malwares that we study all utilizes _ randomized _ epidemic algorithms .",
    "hence the importance of applying the generalized entropy is that the renyi entropy characterizes the bits of information extractable by the randomized epidemic algorithms .",
    "specifically , we explicitly relate the renyi entropy with the randomized epidemic scanning methods through analyzing the spreading speed of network - aware malwares at an early stage of propagation .",
    "a malware that spreads faster at the early stage can in general infect most of the vulnerable hosts in a shorter time .",
    "the propagation ability of a malware at the early stage is characterized by the _ infection rate _ @xcite .",
    "we derive the infection rates of a class of network - aware malwares .",
    "we find that the infection rates of random - scanning and network - aware malwares are determined by the uncertainty of the vulnerable - host distribution or the renyi entropies of different orders .",
    "specifically , a random - scanning malware has the largest uncertainty ( _ e.g. _ , renyi entropy of order zero ) , and an optimal importance - scanning malware has the smallest uncertainty ( _ e.g. _ , renyi entropy with order infinity ) .",
    "moreover , the infection rates of some real network - aware malwares depend on the non - uniformity factors or the renyi entropy of order two . for example , compared with random scanning , localized scanning can increase the infection rate by nearly a non - uniformity factor .",
    "therefore , the infection rates of malware - scanning algorithms are characterized by the renyi entropies , relating the efficiency of a randomized scanning algorithm with the uncertainty on a non - uniform vulnerable - host distribution .",
    "these analytical results on the relationships between vulnerable - host distributions and network - aware malware spreading ability are validated by simulation .",
    "finally , we study new challenges to malware defense posed by network - aware malwares . using the non - uniformity factor",
    ", we show quantitatively that the host - based defense strategies , such as proactive protection @xcite and virus throttling @xcite , should be deployed at almost all hosts to slow down network - aware malwares at the early stage .",
    "a partial deployment would nearly invalidate such host - based defense .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the infection rate of a network - aware malware in the ipv6 internet can be comparable to that of the code red v2 worm in the ipv4 internet . therefore",
    ", fighting network - aware malwares is a real challenge .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : prelim ] introduces information theory and malware propagation .",
    "section [ sec : data ] presents our collected data sets .",
    "section [ sec : formulation ] formulates the problems studied in this work .",
    "section [ sec : factor ] introduces a new metric called the non - uniformity factor and compares this metric to the shannon entropy .",
    "sections [ sec : ability ] and [ sec : simulations ] characterize the spreading ability of network - aware malwares through theoretical analysis and simulation . section [ sec : applications ] further studies the effectiveness of defense strategies on network - aware malwares .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes this paper .",
    "in this section , we provide the background on information theory and malware propagation .",
    "an entropy is a measure of the average information uncertainty of a random variable @xcite .",
    "a general entropy , called the renyi entropy @xcite , is defined as @xmath0 where the random variable @xmath1 is with probability distribution @xmath2 and alphabet @xmath3 .",
    "the well - known shannon entropy is a special case of the renyi entropy , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 it is noted that @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the alphabet size , and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a result from @xmath9 and is called the min - entropy of @xmath1 . in this paper , moreover , we are also interested in the renyi entropy of order two , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10 comparing @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , we have the following theorem that has been proved in @xcite .",
    "[ thm : comp ] @xmath15 with equality if and only if @xmath1 is uniformly distributed over @xmath3 .",
    "information theory has been applied in a wide range of fields , such as communication theory , kolmogorov complexity , and cryptography",
    ". a fundamental result of information theory is that data compression can be achieved by assigning short codewords to the most frequent outcomes of the data source and necessarily longer codewords to the less frequent outcomes @xcite .",
    "similar to data compression , a smart malware that searches for vulnerable hosts can assign more scans to a range of ip addresses that contain more vulnerable hosts .",
    "thus , the malware can reduce the number of scans for attacking a large number of vulnerable hosts .",
    "we call such a malware as a _ network - aware _ malware .",
    "in essence , network - aware malwares consider the network structure ( _ i.e. _ , an uneven distribution of vulnerable hosts ) to speed up the propagation .",
    "many network - aware malwares have been studied .",
    "for example , routable - scanning malwares select targets only in the routable address space , using the information provided by the bgp routing table @xcite .",
    "evasive worms exploit lightweight sampling to obtain the knowledge of _ live _ subnets of the address space and spread only in these networks @xcite . in our prior work , we have studied a class of worst - case malwares , called _ importance - scanning _ malwares , which exploit non - uniform vulnerable - host distributions in an optimal fashion @xcite .",
    "importance scanning is developed from and named after importance sampling in statistics .",
    "importance scanning probes the internet according to an underlying vulnerable - host distribution .",
    "such a scanning method forces malware scans on the most relevant parts of an address space and supplies an optimal scanning strategy . furthermore ,",
    "if the complete information of vulnerable hosts is known , an importance - scanning malware can achieve the top speed of infection and become flash worms @xcite .",
    "we begin our study by considering how significant the unevenness of vulnerable - host distributions is .",
    "we use five large data sets to obtain empirical vulnerable - host distributions .",
    "_ dshield ( d1 ) _ : dshield collects intrusion detection system ( ids ) logs @xcite .",
    "specifically , dshield provides the information of vulnerable hosts by aggregating logs from more than 1,600 idses distributed throughout the internet .",
    "we further focus on the following ports that were attacked by worms : 80 ( http ) , 135 ( dce / rpc ) , 445 ( netbios / smb ) , 1023 ( ftp servers and the remote shell attacked by w32.sasser.e.worm ) , and 6129 ( dameware ) .    _ isinks ( p1 and c1 ) _ : two unused address space monitors run the _ isink _ system @xcite .",
    "the monitors record the unwanted traffic arriving at the unused address spaces that include a class a network ( referred to as  provider \" or p1 ) and two class b networks at the campus of the university of wisconsin ( referred to as  campus \" or c1 ) @xcite .    _ witty - worm victims ( w1 )",
    "_ : a list of witty - worm victims is provided by caida @xcite .",
    "caida used a network telescope with approximate @xmath16 ip addresses to log the traffic of witty - worm victims that are internet security systems ( iss ) products .",
    "_ web - server list ( w2 ) _ : the ip addresses of web servers were collected through uroulette ( http://www.uroulette.com/ ) . uroulette provides a random uniform resource locator ( url ) generator to obtain a list of ip addresses of web servers .",
    "the first three data sets ( d1 , p1 , and c1 ) were collected over a seven - day period from 12/10/2004 to 12/16/2004 and have been studied in @xcite to demonstrate the bursty and spatially inhomogeneous distribution of malicious source ip addresses .",
    "the last two data sets ( w1 and w2 ) have been used in our prior work @xcite to show the virulence of importance - scanning malwares .",
    "the summary of our data sets is given in table [ tab : data ] .",
    ".summary of the data sets . [ cols=\">,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      an infection rate only characterizes the early stage of malware propagation .",
    "we now employ the analytical active worm propagation ( aawp ) model and its extensions to characterize the entire spreading process of malwares @xcite .",
    "specifically , the spread of rs and is malwares is implemented as described in @xcite , whereas the propagation of ls malwares is modeled according to @xcite .",
    "the parameters that we use to simulate a malware are comparable to those of the code red v2 worm .",
    "code red v2 has a vulnerable population @xmath17 and a scanning rate @xmath18 per minute @xcite .",
    "we assume that the malware begins spreading from an initially infected host that is located in the subnet containing the largest number of vulnerable hosts .",
    "we first show the propagation speeds of network - aware malwares for the same vulnerable - host distribution from data set d1 - 80 . from section [ sec :",
    "ability ] , we expect that a network - aware malware can spread much faster than an rs malware .",
    "figure [ fig : methods ] demonstrates such an example on a malware that uses different scanning methods .",
    "it takes an rs malware 10 hours to infect 99% of vulnerable hosts , whereas a /8 ls malware with @xmath19 or a /8 is malware takes only about 3.5 hours . a /16 ls malware with @xmath19 or a 2lls malware with @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "can further reduce the time to 1 hour .",
    "a /16 is malware spreads fastest and takes only 0.5 hour .",
    "we also study the effect of vulnerable - host distributions on the propagation of network - aware malwares . from table",
    "[ tab : uniformity ] , we observe that @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we expect that a network - aware malware using the /16 d1 - 1023 distribution would spread faster than using other three distributions .",
    "figure [ fig : distribution ] verifies this through the simulations of the spread of a 2lls malware that uses different vulnerable - host distributions ( _ i.e. _ , d1 - 1023 , w1 , c1 , and d1 ) . here , the 2lls malware employs the same parameters as the nimda worm , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "as expected , the malware using the d1 - 1023 distribution spreads fastest , especially at the early stage of malware propagation .",
    "what are new requirements and challenges for a defense system to slow down the spread of a network - aware malware ?",
    "we study the effectiveness of defense strategies through non - uniformity factors .",
    "host - based defense has been widely used for random - scanning malwares . proactive protection and virus",
    "throttling are examples of host - based defense strategies .    a _ proactive protection _ ( pp )",
    "strategy proactively hardens a system , making it difficult for a malware to exploit vulnerabilities @xcite .",
    "techniques used by pp include address - space randomization , pointer encryption , instruction - set randomization , and password protection .",
    "thus , a malware requires multiple trials to compromise a host that implements pp .",
    "specifically , let @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) denote the protection probability or the probability that a single malware attempt succeeds in infecting a vulnerable host that implements pp . on the average ,",
    "a malware should make @xmath25 exploit attempts to compromise the target .",
    "we assume that hosts with pp are uniformly deployed in the internet .",
    "let @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) denote the deployment ratio of the number of hosts with pp to the total number of hosts .",
    "to show the effectiveness of the pp strategy , we consider the infection rate of a /@xmath28 is malware .",
    "since now some of the vulnerable hosts implement pp , equation ( [ equ : suboptimal_is ] ) changes to @xmath29 } \\\\ \\label{equ : defense }                      & = & \\alpha_{rs}\\beta^{(l)}(1-d+dp).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to slow down the spread of a suboptimal is malware to that of a random - scanning malware , @xmath30 , resulting in @xmath31 when pp is fully deployed , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath32 , @xmath23 can be at most @xmath33 .",
    "on the other hand , if pp provides perfect protection , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath34 , @xmath26 should be at least @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath36 is large , inequality ( [ equ : require ] ) presents high requirements for the pp strategy .",
    "for example , if @xmath37 ( most of @xmath38 s in table [ tab : uniformity ] are larger than this value ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "that is , a pp strategy should be almost fully deployed and provide a nearly perfect protection for a vulnerable host .",
    "we extend the model described in @xcite to characterize the spread of suboptimal is malwares under the defense of the pp strategy and show the results in figure [ fig : defense ] . here ,",
    "code - red - v2-like malwares spread over the c1 distribution with @xmath41 .",
    "it is observed that even when the protection probability is small ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath42 ) and the deployment ratio is high ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath43 ) , a /16 is malware is slowed down a little at the early stage , compared with a /16 is malware without the pp defense ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "moreover , when @xmath23 is small ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath46 ) , @xmath26 is a more sensitive parameter than @xmath23 .",
    "we next consider the _ virus throttling _ ( vt ) strategy @xcite .",
    "vt constrains the number of outgoing connections of a host and can thus reduce the scanning rate of an infected host .",
    "we find that equation ( [ equ : defense ] ) also holds for this strategy , except that @xmath23 is the ratio of the scanning rate of infected hosts with vt to that of infected hosts without vt .",
    "therefore , vt also requires to be almost fully deployed for fighting network - aware malwares effectively .    from these two strategies , we have learned that an effective strategy should reduce either @xmath47 or @xmath36 .",
    "host - based defense , however , is limited in such capabilities .",
    "ipv6 can decrease @xmath47 significantly by increasing the scanning space @xcite .",
    "but the non - uniformity factor would increase the infection rate if the vulnerable - host distribution is still non - uniform .",
    "hence , an important question is whether ipv6 can counteract network - aware malwares when both @xmath47 and @xmath36 are taken into consideration .",
    "we study this issue by computing the infection rate of a network - aware malware in the ipv6 internet . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", a smart malware can first detect some vulnerable hosts in /64 subnets containing many vulnerable hosts , then release to the hosts on the hitlist , and finally spread inside these subnets .",
    "such a malware only scans the local /64 subnet .",
    "thus , we focus on the spreading speed of a network - aware malware in a /64 subnet . from figure",
    "[ fig : rate ] , we extrapolate that @xmath48 in the ipv6 internet can be in the order of @xmath49 if hosts are still distributed in a clustered fashion .",
    "using the parameters @xmath50 proposed by @xcite and @xmath51 used by the slammer worm @xcite , we derive the infection rate of a /32 is malware in a /64 subnet of the ipv6 internet : @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is larger than the infection rate of the code red v2 worm in the ipv4 internet , where @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , ipv6 can only slow down the spread of a network - aware malware to that of a random - scanning malware in ipv4 . to defend against the malware effectively",
    ", we should further consider how to slow down the increase rate of @xmath36 as @xmath28 increases when ipv4 is updated to ipv6 .",
    "in essence , we should reduce the information bits extractable by the network - aware malwares from the vulnerable - host distribution .",
    "in this paper , we have first obtained and characterized empirical vulnerable - host distributions , using five large measurement sets from different sources .",
    "we have derived a simple metric , known as the non - uniformity factor , to quantify an uneven distribution of vulnerable hosts .",
    "the non - uniformity factors have been obtained on the empirical vulnerable - host distributions using our collected data , and all of which demonstrate large values .",
    "this implies that the non - uniformity of the vulnerable - host distribution is significant and seems to be consistent across networks and applications .",
    "moreover , the non - uniformity factor , shown as a function of the renyi entropies of order two and zero , better characterizes the uneven feature of a distribution than the shannon entropy .",
    "we have drawn a relationship between renyi entropies and randomized epidemic scanning algorithms .",
    "in particular , we have quantified the spreading ability of network - aware malwares that utilize randomized scanning algorithms at the early stage .",
    "these randomized malware - scanning algorithms range from optimal randomized scanning ( _ e.g. _ , importance scanning ) to real malware scanning ( _ e.g. _ , localized scanning ) .",
    "we have derived analytical expressions relating the infection rates of network - aware malwares with the uncertainty ( _ i.e. _ , renyi entropy ) of finding vulnerable hosts .",
    "we have derived and empirically verified that localized scanning and modified sequential scanning can increase the infection rate by nearly a non - uniformity factor when compared to random scanning and thus approach the capacity of suboptimal importance scanning . as a result",
    ", we have bridged the information bits extracted by malwares from a vulnerable - host distribution with the propagation speed of network - aware malwares .",
    "furthermore , we have evaluated the effectiveness of several commonly used defense strategies on network - aware malwares .",
    "the host - based defense , such as proactive protection or virus throttling , requires to be almost fully deployed to slow down malware spreading at the early stage .",
    "this implies that host - based defense would be weakened significantly by network - aware scanning . more surprisingly , different from previous findings",
    ", we have shown that network - aware malwares can be zero - day malwares in the ipv6 internet if vulnerable hosts are still clustered .",
    "these findings present a significant challenge to malware defense : entirely different strategies may be needed for fighting against network - aware malwares .",
    "the information - theoretical view of malware attacks provides us a quantification and a better understanding of three aspects : a non - uniform vulnerable - host distribution characterized by the non - uniformity factor or the renyi entropy of order two , randomized malware - scanning algorithms characterized by the infection rate or the renyi entropy of different orders , and the effectiveness of defense strategies .    as part of our ongoing work",
    ", we plan to study in more depth relationships between information theory and dynamic malware attacks for developing effective detection and defense systems that would take vulnerable - host distributions into consideration .",
    "we are grateful to paul barford for providing us with the data sets on vulnerable - host distributions and his insightful comments on this work .",

    "<S> this work investigates three aspects : ( a ) a _ network vulnerability _ as the non - uniform vulnerable - host distribution , ( b ) _ threats _ , _ i.e. _ , intelligent malwares that exploit such a vulnerability , and ( c ) _ defense _ , _ i.e. _ , challenges for fighting the threats . </S>",
    "<S> we first study five large data sets and observe consistent clustered vulnerable - host distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we then present a new metric , referred to as the _ non - uniformity factor _ , which quantifies the unevenness of a vulnerable - host distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this metric is essentially the renyi information entropy and better characterizes the non - uniformity of a distribution than the shannon entropy . </S>",
    "<S> next , we analyze the propagation speed of network - aware malwares in view of information theory . in particular , we draw a relationship between renyi entropies and randomized epidemic malware - scanning algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the infection rates of malware - scanning methods are characterized by the renyi entropies that relate to the information bits in a non - unform vulnerable - host distribution extracted by a randomized scanning algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , we show that a representative network - aware malware can increase the spreading speed by exactly or nearly a non - uniformity factor when compared to a random - scanning malware at an early stage of malware propagation . </S>",
    "<S> this quantifies that how much more rapidly the internet can be infected at the early stage when a malware exploits an uneven vulnerable - host distribution as a network - wide vulnerability . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we analyze the effectiveness of defense strategies on the spread of network - aware malwares . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that counteracting network - aware malwares is a significant challenge for the strategies that include host - based defense and ipv6 . </S>"
