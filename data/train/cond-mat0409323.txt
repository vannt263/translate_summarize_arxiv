    "the dynamics of glassy materials such as spin - glasses , structural glasses or amorphous soft materials like gels , pastes or foams has been a subject of considerable study @xcite .",
    "considerable effort has been made in order to understand and quantify the out - of - equilibrium character of their temporal relaxation , in particular the absence of time translational invariance ( aging ) , through the study of dynamic correlation functions .",
    "on the theoretical side , global dynamic correlations have been described at a mean - field level in disordered systems such as spin - glasses @xcite , or at a phenomenological level in models such as the random energy model @xcite . both approaches",
    "neglect all spatial properties of the system , and are therefore likely to miss any spatial correlations that arise during the dynamics .",
    "alternatively , a phenomenological picture , the droplet model , has been proposed , that focuses on the spatial properties as a key to understand the slow dynamics and the critical properties of spin - glasses @xcite .    in recent years ,",
    "interest in the spatial properties of glassy systems has been growing .",
    "the size of excitations in finite - dimensional spin - glasses has been studied numerically @xcite . in simulations of kinetically",
    "constrained glassy systems @xcite , and of supercooled liquids @xcite , cooperativity lengths have been identified , and related to the presence of heterogeneities in the dynamics @xcite .    more generally , a lot of physical questions remain ; a crucial one being : in what manner , at a microscopic level , does a glassy system evolve , both spatially and temporally ?",
    "what are the spatial configurations of the typical rearrangements experienced by a glassy system during its relaxation and how are they affected by aging ?",
    "are there any common relaxation mechanisms of glassy systems , though there also exist specificities to given materials ? recently , new results have been obtained in this direction .",
    "focusing on the spatial aspect of glassy relaxation , cooperative rearrangements events have been evidenced , both experimentally @xcite and through computer simulations @xcite , stimulating new research on the challenging question of coherence lengths and cooperativity in glasses . on the temporal side ,",
    "beautiful experiments have shown evidence of temporal intermittency in colloidal gels and micellar polycrystals @xcite , and in polycarbonate glasses @xcite .",
    "it seems now well established that in glasses and gels , relaxation takes place in a discontinuous way , involving sudden rearrangements followed by periods of arrest where almost nothing happens .",
    "the precise experimental determination of the distribution of time lags between rearranging events will give insight into the characterictic `` trapping times '' of the system . in experiments on glasses ,",
    "this distribution seems to be close to a power - law @xcite -which is consistent with a trap model with an exponential distribution of energies @xcite- , whereas it has been found in simulations of supercooled glasses to correspond to a model of traps with either an exponentiel distribution of energies , or a gaussian distribution of energies @xcite .",
    "therefore , quantities of interest are not just average quantities , but also fluctuations , and in particular the full probability distributions of correlations .",
    "the study of fluctuations in glassy systems may contain subtle information , as was already realized by israeloff and weissman @xcite , who analyzed carefully mesoscopic noise in spin - glasses in an attempt to discriminate between a model of droplets , and a scenario of hierarchical dynamics .",
    "recently , probability distributions of two - time correlation functions in gels and glasses have been shown to exhibit a non - gaussian behaviour @xcite .",
    "these non - gaussian features have been found also in numerical simulations of disordered systems and kinetically constrained models @xcite .",
    "they have been tentatively explained using the analogy between glassy dynamics and critical dynamics @xcite , for which universal , non - gaussian features can be expected @xcite .    in this study , we will not advocate any similarity with critical dynamics , but we will rather try to deduce the non - gaussian behaviour merely from finite - size effects in a simple out - of - equilibrium glassy model .    we will consider a system that can be divided into @xmath2 independent subsystems . each subsystem is supposed to represent an independent model of glassy relaxation between energy traps .",
    "such a model of traps has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "we will show that the superposition of the @xmath2 subsystems will have the same average dynamical correlation as one individual subsystem ; however , its probability distribution function will depend strongly on @xmath2 ; in the limit @xmath9 , one has to recover the gaussian distribution , according to the central limit theorem .",
    "moreover , the distribution of time intervals between relaxation events or between decorrelations will depend crucially on the number of subsystems , i.e on the value of the internal coherence length .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and recall the main results of @xcite . in section iii ,",
    "we calculate the distribution of time intervals between successive events in the whole system . in section iv",
    ", we calculate the distribution of time intervals between successive decorrelations in the system , the same way they can be measured in time resolved correlation experiments on soft glassy materials @xcite .",
    "section v is devoted to the probability distribution of the two - time correlation function .",
    "finally , in section vi , we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "let us consider a simple model of dynamics of a system between energy levels . in a generic disordered system",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that low - lying energy levels are exponentially distributed : this is the case for example for the lowest energy levels ( non - extensive corrections to the ground state energy ) of the random energy model ( rem ) @xcite or in spin - glasses @xcite",
    ". experimental determination of energy barriers in low - temperature glasses also seem to support this exponential distribution @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let us call @xmath10 an energy barrier , which is the difference between a reference energy level which is taken as the origin for the energies , and a negative energy level .",
    "@xmath10 is hence a positive quantity .",
    "we choose the distribution of barriers as @xmath11 .",
    "changes in configurations in a disordered or glassy system are often attributed to thermally activated events over energy barriers @xcite , although other mecanisms exist , such as kinetically constrained models @xcite , which do not require an energy landscape , and are able to reproduce some of the features of glassy materials . in the language of activated events , a trapping time @xmath12 corresponding to a barrier @xmath10",
    "can be defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a microscopic time scale , @xmath15 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath16 the temperature . for an exponential distribution of barriers , the distribution of trapping times is equal to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "the dynamics of a system evolving in such an energy landscape has been studied by different authors , according to which choice of transition rates between energy levels is made @xcite . in the following , we will consider only the case where the transition rate from barrier @xmath10 to any other barrier@xmath19 is @xmath20 , @xcite , which means that the escape from the initial trap is the limiting process , whatever the destination .",
    "note that this family of models does not include any kind of spatial structure , since energy is not related here to spatial configurations , and that it is mean - field in nature since transitions to all levels are allowed with the same probability .",
    "extensions of these models to finite dimensionalities have however been attempted in @xcite .",
    "we will see in the following that the superposition of several of such systems can actually introduce ( though rather artificially ) a relevant lengthscale .",
    "dynamical properties of the model have been studied in detail in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath21 , the model exhibits aging ( absence of time translation invariance of the correlations ) , whereas it is time - translationally invariant for @xmath22 . in this paper , we will focus on the case @xmath8 . for a given trajectory of the system , the two - time correlation function @xmath23 is defined as : @xmath24 if the system has remained in the same energy trap between @xmath5 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 if between @xmath5 and @xmath25 , the system has left the energy trap it was in at @xmath5 .",
    "averaging over all barrier configurations ( which we denote by @xmath27 ) , one obtains the average two - time correlation function :    @xmath28    it was shown in @xcite that for large @xmath5 , this function is given by the following formula :    @xmath29    which we will use in sections iii and v.      another important quantity for our study is the sprinkling density of events at time @xmath31 , @xmath30 .",
    "an `` event '' has to be understood as a jump from an energy level to another one .",
    "the sprinkling density of events @xmath30 is defined as the time density distribution of having an event at time @xmath31 -whatever the number of events before @xmath31- and given that there was one event at @xmath32 .",
    "this is a standard quantity defined in the context of renewal theory @xcite . for any distribution of trapping times @xmath33 where the trapping times are independent random variables -and given that it does not depend on the age , i.e on the choice of the time origin- , and independently of the type of dynamics used",
    ", the following formula holds :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 stands for the time of the last event to have taken place before @xmath31 ; the first term @xmath36 corresponds to the special case @xmath37 .    in the following , we will use the following trapping times distribution : @xmath38 , in order to ensure that @xmath12 can take values from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "we will also need the large time behaviour of the corresponding sprinkling density @xmath30 .",
    "following the lines of @xcite , this can be easily computed using laplace transforms . using the notation @xmath41 to denote the laplace transform of a function @xmath42 , equation ( 1 ) is equivalent to    @xmath43    the laplace transform @xmath44",
    "can be computed as :    @xmath45    two cases have to be considered before taking the limit @xmath46 .    if @xmath21 , @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 , and for @xmath49 , @xmath50 ; with @xmath51 .    in this regime ,",
    "@xmath30 decreases with time ; the decrease in time of the density of events results in the aging of the correlation function @xmath52 , which characteristic time scale is proportional to the age @xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that @xmath55 , and that for @xmath49 , @xmath56 . in this non - aging regime ,",
    "the sprinkling density is uniform in time and simply equal to the inverse trapping time @xmath57 .",
    "let us now turn to our system of interest .",
    "this new system is defined as the superposition of @xmath2 subsystems , identical to the one introduced previously , each of which is defined by the same trapping times distribution : @xmath38 .",
    "the subsystems are assumed to be independent of each other .",
    "one can give an interpretation of such a model in a real space representation : given a system of size @xmath0 in @xmath4 dimensions , we assume that one can divide this system into @xmath2 independent subsystems of length @xmath1 , where @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath1 is the typical coherence length of the system , and is considered constant during the time relaxation .",
    "however , we will see that this quantity is susceptible to evolve during aging .    during the dynamical evolution ,",
    "each system relaxes independently , and hence contributes to some extent to the relaxation of the whole system .",
    "we will make the following assumptions : _",
    "( i ) _ all events occuring in a subsystem are also defined as individual events for the whole system , _",
    "( ii ) _ all events contribute equally to the relaxation of the whole system .",
    "this translates into the following definitions :    @xmath58 _ (",
    "i ) _ the analog for the whole system of @xmath33 will be denoted as @xmath59 : it is the distribution of time intervals between all events ( i.e trapping times ) .",
    "we will see in the next section that this quantity depends in general on the age @xmath5 ; we will then call it @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath58 _ ( ii ) _ the correlation function of the whole system is defined as @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the correlation function of subsystem @xmath63 .    before turning to a detailed calculation of @xmath60",
    ", we can invoke an argument of statistics of extremes . if @xmath12 is a trapping time of the whole system",
    ", then it seems natural to say that @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a trapping time of each subsystem @xmath63 .",
    "however , this is true only if all subsystems undergo one event at some time origin , and that one computes the first trapping time of the whole system from this time origin .",
    "hence this argument definitely excludes aging effects , because it neglects any memory effects in the dynamics of the subsystems .",
    "having made this approximation , one can follow a standard calculation of statistics of extremes , and one can find the distribution of time intervals @xmath59 :    @xmath66^{n-1 } = n\\mu \\frac{\\tau_0^{\\mu n}}{(\\tau_0+\\tau)^{1+\\mu n}}\\ ] ]    by expanding around the most probable value @xmath67 , and setting @xmath68 , one finds the limiting exponential distribution @xmath69 for @xmath70 ( i.e @xmath71 ) .",
    "this corresponds in fact to the convergence of the probability distribution of extremes towards the weibull distribution , in the case where the elementary distribution @xmath33 has a finite value for its minimum time @xmath67 @xcite .    in this approximation",
    ", the time distribution of events of the whole system simply follows a poisson process , with a rate proportional to the number of subsystems . in a poisson process ,",
    "the conditions of the experiment are supposed to remain constant in time , and all events are independent of each other .",
    "however , in this model , although single events in all subsystems are indeed independent of each other , the dynamics is not invariant under time translations ( as can be inferred from the sprinkling density @xmath30 ) . as we shall see in the next section",
    ", this will give rise to more complicated laws for @xmath60 .    note finally that we have not been able to find a suitable argument of statistics of extremes for @xmath23 (",
    "the statistics of this quantity in the framework of non - equilibrium dynamics have been related to the gumbel distributions @xcite , which are one of the `` universal '' families of probability distributions of extremes ) .",
    "instead , we will gain information ( see section v ) by studying @xmath23 as the sum of @xmath2 random variables , reinforcing the idea that it is not an extremal quantity , but rather originates in the contribution of many individual events ( as was already pointed out in @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath60 be the probability that an event takes place at @xmath25 if one took place at @xmath5 , in the system composed of @xmath2 independent subsystems .    in this section",
    ", it will be more practical for the computation to work with the cumulative probability distribution @xmath72 . by definition , it is the probability that the time difference between two successive events is larger than @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , we will use @xmath73 , which is the probability for a trapping time of a subsystem to be larger than @xmath12 , i.e the probability for a subsystem not to change trap during the period of time @xmath12 .",
    "we now call @xmath63 the subsystem in which one event has taken place at @xmath5",
    ". then let @xmath74 be the @xmath75 times of the last events before @xmath5 in the other subsystems @xmath76 .",
    "the next event to take place in the whole system will either happen in subsystem @xmath63 or in any other subsystem . in order for this next event to occur after a time @xmath12 ,",
    "one requires the following conditions :    @xmath58 _ ( i ) _ subsystem @xmath63 has to remain trapped between @xmath5 and @xmath25 , with probability @xmath77 , and    @xmath58_(ii ) _ the other subsystems @xmath76 have to remain trapped between @xmath78 and @xmath25 , with probability @xmath79 , @xmath80 being the contribution for the special case @xmath81 .",
    "this last probability is in fact equal to @xmath52 , the probability for a system to remain trapped between times @xmath5 and @xmath25 ( see section ii ) .",

    "we now treat separately two different regimes for @xmath12 : @xmath85 @xmath86 , and @xmath87 @xmath88 finite and smaller than @xmath89 .      in the regime of interest",
    "where @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( see section ii ) .",
    "so that the leading term in @xmath5 is :    @xmath92    then , we get the result :    @xmath93    and    @xmath94    we note that for @xmath95 the result @xmath96 is recovered . as @xmath2 increases , the exponential part in ( [ case1 ] ) becomes dominant , introducing a rate that is dependent on the waiting time : @xmath97 .    this can be interpreted as an effective poisson process , where the number of instances @xmath2 is replaced ( for large @xmath2 ) by @xmath98    in other words , the scaling of ( [ case1 ] ) suggests that computing at age @xmath5 the distribution of events of a system composed initially of @xmath2 subsystems is the same as computing the distribution of events of a `` young '' system composed of @xmath6 subsystems . in the case of ( [ case1 ] ) , one can see that @xmath6 decreases explicitly with the age ; in the limiting case where aging disappears ( @xmath99 ) , @xmath100 is simply a constant equal to @xmath2 . the idea of a number of independent subsystems decreasing with the age in non - equilibrium systems is not new .",
    "it is intimately related to the concept of a growing lengthscale in an aging system . if one defines a typical length @xmath1 of a subsystem by @xmath3 , one has @xmath101 , and the dependence of @xmath100 on @xmath5 induces the following power - law for @xmath102 :    @xmath103      in the regime most accessible experimentally , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , which leads to the result :    @xmath106    and    @xmath107   e^{-(n-1)c(\\mu ) \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{t_w}\\right)^{1-\\mu } }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    again the limiting case @xmath108 for @xmath95 is recovered . in this regime ,",
    "when @xmath2 increases , the distribution @xmath109 evolves towards a stretched exponential in @xmath12 , with a characteristic time proportional to the age @xmath5 .",
    "but as in the case of ( [ case1 ] ) , the scaling of ( [ case2 ] ) suggests that the system at @xmath5 is equivalent to a `` young '' system composed of @xmath6 subsystems with @xmath110 .",
    "let us now be more precise concerning the relevance of the quantity @xmath6 .",
    "the physical meaning of the effective number of subsystems and of the effective coherence length is the following .",
    "consider the system at time @xmath111 , with a coherence length @xmath112 .",
    "this system is hence made of @xmath113 independent subsystems of size @xmath112 , by definition of the model ; and each subsystem is a trap model that can hop in different states in time , with average hopping rate @xmath114 .",
    "each subsystem ages , so that at some later time @xmath115 , the hopping rate decreases and is equal to @xmath116 .",
    "this also means that per unit time , less subsystems have hopped than at age @xmath111 . in a real space picture , the subsystems that hop are then more sparse and far away from each other .",
    "this induces some kind of enhanced spatial correlation .",
    "then one can make a coarse graining of subsystems and define bigger subsystems , of size @xmath117 , in such a way that the hopping rate of these new subsystems is the same as at time @xmath111 , which is possible , precisely because they are bigger .",
    "hence the total system at time @xmath115 is now a collection of @xmath118 subsystems of size @xmath117 , each of which hops at the same rate as the @xmath113 subsystems of size @xmath112 at time @xmath111 .",
    "this can actually be quantified by a simple argument .",
    "the average hopping rate of one subsystem at time @xmath111 is @xmath114 . at time @xmath115",
    ", one defines a coarse - grained subsystem as composed of @xmath119 of the former subsystems",
    ". then the average hopping rate of one coarse - grained subsystem at time @xmath115 is @xmath120 .",
    "the hopping rates are chosen to be equal , which leads to @xmath121 . in the special case of @xmath122 and @xmath123 ,",
    "one finds : @xmath124 , which is exactly the relation for @xmath6 found from the previous calculations .    to conclude this section , the study of the two cases investigated above show that for a small system , @xmath109 ( and @xmath60 ) will still be very close to the power - law characterizing one single subsystem . for a very large system ,",
    "@xmath109 crosses over from an exponential form to a stretched exponential form at larger @xmath12 .",
    "in general , there will be a crossover in @xmath60 from an exponential times a power - law , to a stretched exponential times a power - law , as @xmath12 increases . in all cases ,",
    "the distributions become fatter with the age , which allows to define an effective number of subsystems @xmath110 , or equivalently an effective coherence length @xmath125 .    for illustration , we plot on figure 1 the cumulative probability distribution @xmath109 in the two regimes studied for different values of @xmath2 ; the values of the parameters are @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .     in the two regimes studied for @xmath129 ; the values of the parameters are @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 . as @xmath2 is increased , the departure from the power - law is observed .",

    "when one is not able experimentally to identify individual rearrangement events , it may be easier to turn to the study of the fluctuations of global quantities such as correlation functions .",
    "more precisely , in the scattering experiments of @xcite , non averaged correlation functions called @xmath130 are computed .",

    "this allows to compute the probability distribution of @xmath131 , @xmath132 , for a given @xmath12 and a given age @xmath5 .",
    "this is exactly what we compute in section v , if we assume that the function @xmath23 of our model can be identified with @xmath130 .",
    "the main experimental finding , namely that @xmath132 is a negatively skewed distribution for a value @xmath12 small compared to @xmath5 in a non - equilibrium system ( a colloidal gel ) , is recovered in section v.    in the analysis of the time series of @xmath130 , one can also compute the distribution of time intervals between significant decorrelations of the system -i.e big downward jumps of @xmath130- , which is accessible experimentally .",
    "note that these big jumps do not necessarily correspond to the same individual `` events '' studied in section ii and section iii , and actually correspond to the superposition of several of them .",

    "in section iii , we used the notion of `` events '' , and calculated their time distribution , because it was the most natural quantity to compute in the framework of the model presented here .",
    "however , it may be difficult in an experiment to identify such events , or even to find a reasonable definition of individual events .",
    "a well - defined quantity that is more readily accessible is the distribution probability of a correlator @xmath138 , as has been recently investigated in numerical simulations @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "each subsystem @xmath63 is a two - level system , where the correlation @xmath270 can only take the values @xmath39 or @xmath89 .",
    "more precisely , the probability distribution of the correlation of a subsystem @xmath63 is :    @xmath271    where the parameter @xmath272 coincides with the average value of the correlation for the values of @xmath5 and @xmath12 considered : @xmath273 . in the following",
    "we will omit temporarily the dependence of @xmath272 on @xmath5 and @xmath12 , for simplicity in the notations .    for the whole system ( the superposition of the @xmath2 independent subsystems ) ,",
    "the definition of @xmath138 has been given in section ii .",
    "one can actually rewrite this quantity as :    @xmath274    where @xmath275 is the number of subsystems that remained in the same energy trap between @xmath5 and @xmath25 , and @xmath135 the number of subsystems that changed trap between @xmath5 and @xmath25 .    then , in order to find the value @xmath276 for the correlation between times @xmath5 and @xmath25 , one has to draw @xmath277 subsystems among @xmath2 instances that are trapped during this time interval , with probability @xmath272 , and @xmath278 subsystems that changed trap during this time interval , with probability @xmath279 .",
    "hence , the probability distribution of @xmath276 , @xmath280 , is simply the binomial distribution : @xmath281 , with    @xmath282    and @xmath283 is the binomial coefficient .",

    "@xmath295 is explicitly defined using the relation of section ii .",
    "moreover , we use the results of section iii that suggest that at age @xmath5 , the system can actually be considered as a superposition of @xmath296 independent subsystems . hence in the preceding formulae for @xmath291 ,",
    "@xmath292 , @xmath293 , we replace @xmath2 by @xmath6 .",
    "we want to stress that it is not proved here that this mapping can be applied to the case of the full probability of the correlation functions , it is only a phenomenological attempt to try to extend this coarse - graining to the calculation of other quantities than the distribution of times .",
    "this argument actually leads to results compatible to what is found in experiments .    in figures 3 , 4 and 5 , @xmath291 , @xmath292 , and @xmath293",
    "are shown as a function of @xmath12 for different values of @xmath5 , for @xmath297 and @xmath286 . as observed in recent experiments on foams @xcite",
    ", one can see that the variance is maximum at a time @xmath12 of the order of the relaxation time ( which in our model is proportional to the age @xmath5 ) , and goes to 0 at large @xmath12 ; this maximum increases with the age .",
    "the skewness is negative at small @xmath12 , crosses the origin at intermediate times when @xmath280 becomes symetric and then becomes positive ; the negative skewness is more and more pronounced when @xmath5 increases .",
    "the kurtosis is positive at small times , then negative , and positive again at large @xmath12 , while the negative part becomes more and more pronounced with the age .",
    "all these results are compatible with recent numerical simulations @xcite , and seem to be compatible with preliminary experiments on colloidal gels @xcite .",
    "note again that the use of @xmath6 contains crucial information : if @xmath2 was kept constant , the curves would simply be superimposed by a @xmath298 rescaling , in particular , the maxima and minima of the variance , skewness and kurtosis would not depend on the age .",
    "finally , we computed the probability distribution @xmath280 for a given @xmath298 ratio - i.e a given value of the average correlation @xmath299- , at different ages , therefore for different @xmath6 ; the system is made initially of @xmath300 independent subsystems .",
    "figure 6 shows such probability distributions , for @xmath297 , @xmath301 , @xmath300 , plotting @xmath302 versus @xmath303 .",
    "one can see that even for @xmath300 , systematic deviations exist , though they may be hard to distinguish when an experimental noise is present .",
    "deviations are systematic as @xmath5 increases , which is not surprising since @xmath6 decreases with the age ; the central limit theorem is less and less valid as @xmath5 increases .",
    "note that we tried to fit these curves with gumbel distributions like in @xcite , but we did nt find a very precise agreement in our case . finally , let us note that our results fail to reproduce the expected zero limit of the skewness and kurtosis of @xmath280 when @xmath304 .",
    "these two quantities actually diverge in our case for any finite @xmath2 , because @xmath280 tends to a delta function @xmath305 and @xmath306 .",

    "the power - law behaviour of a single subsystem is the dominant behaviour . for large @xmath2 , at very small time intervals ,",
    "this distribution is exponential and crosses over at larger time intervals to a stretched exponential . in the two regimes",
    ", a natural scaling between @xmath2 and @xmath5 appears , which allows to define an age dependent effective number of subsystems @xmath6 which decreases with @xmath5 , or equivalently , an effective coherence length which grows slowly with the age : @xmath311 .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether experimental results also display the different regimes calculated here .",
    "in particular , one could observe an exponential or a stretched exponential distribution for a young system , and a power - law distribution for an aged system .",
    "as explained in section iii , the interpretation of @xmath312 comes from the aging of all individual subsystems : the systems that hop are more rare when @xmath5 increases , and hence further apart from each other ; this introduces a relevant lengthscale @xmath313 that grows with @xmath5 .",
    "we also computed @xmath139 the distribution of time intervals between successive decorrelations over an interval @xmath12 , larger than @xmath257 .",
    "this quantity , like @xmath280 , is accessible through scattering experiments .",
    "although the derivation of this quantity is a bit technical , the results can be summarized in the following way . in the extreme case where one only counts the largest decorrelations ( @xmath141 ) , the distribution of time intervals between successive decorrelations crosses over from a power law with a small exponent at small @xmath2 ( or large @xmath5 ) to a power - law with a large exponent at large @xmath2 ( or small @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is hoped that in experiments , these regimes will be observed , when one varies the age or other parameters .",
    "for example , if the temperature is decreased in a glass , or the density is increased in a gel , or if one increases the quench rate , one expects that the coherence length increases , i.e the number of independent subsystems decreases . for @xmath314 ,",
    "the results are more difficult to obtain , due to technical complications , and are likely to be reliable only for intermediate values of @xmath136 .",
    "if @xmath136 is small ( i.e one counts only the decorrelations corresponding to a few subsystems ) , the distribution @xmath139 is a power - law ; if @xmath136 is larger , it is a stretched exponential and for @xmath136 large it is an exponential .",
    "equivalently , since one expects the number of subsystems to decrease with the age , @xmath139 is typically an exponential at small @xmath5 , then a stretched exponential and finally a power - law at large @xmath5 , for a given value of the correlation threshold @xmath315 .",
    "finally , we also computed analytically the probability distribution of the correlator @xmath280 , which reproduces many features of the experimental findings of @xcite and of the numerical results of @xcite .",
    "we used the fact ( not shown rigorously ) that at @xmath5 the system can be described as a collection of @xmath6 independent subsystems .",
    "no rescaling to some time - evolving gumbell distribution seems to be relevant here .",
    "since the full probability is calculated here , it would be interesting to compare it more quantitatively to experimental results .",
    "in particular , we find that the variance grows with the age like @xmath316 .    although these results are derived from a simplified theoretical model , we think that such a description captures the essential intermittent character of the relaxation of a realistic glassy system , together with the existence of a coherence lengthscale growing with the age , due to the decrease of the rate of events in time .",
    "we hope that these findings will be helpful in analyzing more quantitatively some experimental results .",
    "in particular , the results of section iv and section v might be of interest for the time resolved correlation experiments of @xcite .",
    "however , since the individual trap model is probably a very crude model for the relaxation of realistic materials ( @xmath317 is a priori unlikely to coincide with the experimental average relaxation function of colloidal gels ) , it may be interesting in a further study to replace it with a more realistic dynamical model for jammed colloidal gels @xcite . concerning the intermittency dynamics studied in @xcite , the quantities calculated in section iii are maybe the most relevant ones to compare with the experimental results .",
    "the model studied here has the major disadvantage that the relevant coherence length of the system is introduced by hand through the superposition of several subsystems .",
    "however , we were able to extract useful information from this picture",
    ". it would be more satisfactory to solve a model where an aging coherence length builds up during the dynamics , resulting from microscopic dynamics .",
    "candidates could be special cases of kinetically constrained models , though analytical calculations will be quite hard @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the intermittent dynamics and the fluctuations of the dynamic correlation function of a simple aging system . given its size @xmath0 and its coherence length @xmath1 , the system can be divided into @xmath2 independent subsystems , where @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the dimension of space . each of them is considered as an aging subsystem which evolves according to an activated dynamics between energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> we compute analytically the distribution of trapping times for the global system , which can take power - law , stretched - exponential or exponential forms according to the values of @xmath2 and the regime of times considered . </S>",
    "<S> an effective number of subsystems at age @xmath5 , @xmath6 , can be defined , which decreases as @xmath5 increases , as well as an effective coherence length , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 characterizes the trapping times distribution of a single subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the probability distribution functions of the time intervals between large decorrelations , which exhibit different power - law behaviours as @xmath5 increases ( or @xmath2 decreases ) , and which should be accessible experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we calculate the probability distribution function of the two - time correlator . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in a phenomenological approach , where @xmath2 is replaced by the effective number of subsystems @xmath6 , the same qualitative behaviour as in experiments and simulations of several glassy systems can be obtained . </S>"
