    "the study of the host galaxies of bl lacertae objects in recent years has contributed much to our understanding of these enigmatic objects . according to unified schemes for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ,",
    "bl lacs are low - luminosity @xcite type i ( fri ) radio galaxies whose jets are aimed very close to our line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this explains their observed extreme properties primarily by relativistic beaming in the jet .",
    "the host galaxies and environments of bl lacs should therefore be independent of orientation effects and should be similar to those of the hosts of fris . indeed , observational data confirm that bl lac objects are predominantly found at the center of giant , but otherwise normal , elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , the available integrated colors and color profiles in a number of these galaxies reveal stellar populations typical of normal ellipticals at the appropriate redshifts @xcite , consistent with the bulk of the star formation having occurred at the redshifts of at least a few .    here ,",
    "we report on moderately deep near - infrared ( nir ) observations of twelve bl lacs drawn from the larger sample of 110 objects observed ( mostly in r - band ) in the _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) wfpc2 survey of bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "the survey targets were drawn from seven complete radio , optical , and x - ray flux limited samples .",
    "a subset of the sample was observed with nicmos at h - band @xcite , and there are two objects in common with the present observations ( ms2143 + 070 and h2356309 ) .",
    "our relatively long ground - based nir observations had the advantage over the nicmos data that we were able to follow the surface brightness profiles of each object out to larger radii .",
    "nir filters give us greater sensitivity to older , and therefore redder stellar populations compared to optical filters .",
    "the number of targets in this study is comparable to the h - band samples studied by @xcite and @xcite , and we utilized their results for comparison . following much of the previous literature on this subject , we use @xmath12 = 50 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 and @xmath14 = 0 throughout this paper .",
    "twelve bl lac objects were observed with the du pont 2.5 m f/7.5 telescope at the las campanas observatory on four nights from 28 september to 1 october 1998 using the 256@xmath15256 sq .",
    "pixel nir camera @xcite at medium resolution , with a scale of 0@xmath16.348/pixel .",
    "the seeing during our observations was typically below 1@xmath16 fwhm ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "we used the j@xmath17 ( 1.24 @xmath18 m ) , h ( 1.65 @xmath18 m ) , and k@xmath17 ( 2.16 @xmath18 m ) filters , where j@xmath17 and k@xmath17 are variants of the respective standard bands designed to reduce the background signal at these wavebands @xcite , and h is the h - band filter of the cit / ctio photometric system .",
    "differences between the j@xmath17- and k@xmath17-bands from the standard j and k are negligible and we refer to only the standard bands throughout the rest of this paper . we observed two bl lacs in all three nir bands , three were observed in both j and k , and the remaining seven were imaged in k only .",
    "the observations are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we used the noao image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) package to calibrate the data .",
    "raw exposures were dark subtracted and flat fielded .",
    "flats for each filter were made by median combining several night sky exposures  usually referred to as `` super sky flats '' .",
    "bad pixels were identified via a mask image made from a ratio of two real sky flats with different exposure times using the task ` ccdmask ` .",
    "these bad pixels were substituted with interpolated values using the task ` fixpix ` .    due to the high and widely varying sky brightness at nir wavelengths , we dithered our exposures over nine positions in a square grid on the ccd to construct the sky frames , usually acquiring several short exposures at each position in order to prevent saturation .",
    "each dithered image was sky subtracted , shifted relative to the center image , and then median - combined . in most cases ,",
    "a series of these dithered exposures of the target were taken consecutively in the same night and were combined .",
    "observations of standard stars taken from @xcite were used to set the photometry .",
    "we found an inconsistency in the photometry for one star ( ss9175 ) used during the last night of our observing run .",
    "the chart for this object is suspected to have been printed incorrectly ( e. persson , 2000 , private communication ) , therefore we simply did not use it in our calibration .",
    "the rms in the zero - points derived from the three other standards within each night was smaller than 0.1 mag in all three bands .",
    "we found also that the standards were stable to better than 0.1 mag over the course of the four night observing run ; we therefore estimate conservatively that our 1@xmath19 error in photometry is 0.1 mag .    in order to maximize the signal from the underlying hosts in our analysis , we extracted azimuthally averaged one - dimensional surface brightness profiles from the final bl lac images using an interactive script implemented in ` supermongo ` .",
    "the profiles were then fitted with a point spread function ( psf ) plus @xcite @xmath1 elliptical galaxy model convolved with the psf , using a @xmath20 minimization technique as outlined in @xcite . in all cases ( with the possible exception of h1914194 ) the hosts were known to be elliptical @xcite , so no attempts were made to fit the resolved emission with exponential disk profiles .",
    "stars within our @xmath21 field of view were often too dim to extract a psf with accurate wings . since only the central part of the psf is affected by the seeing , we combined the innermost ( @xmath22 ) part of the field star profile ( or an average when multiple stars were in the field ) in each bl lac image with the outer wing extracted from a standard star observed in the same band on the same night .",
    "we found that this technique provided us with reliable descriptions of the psf out to @xmath23 .",
    "final k - band images of the twelve objects observed are shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] ; the available j- and h - band images display very similar morphology to the k - band images so are not presented .",
    "azimuthally averaged k - band profiles for the targets extracted from the images in figure  [ fig-1 ] are presented in figure  [ fig-2 ] , and the best fit model parameters for all bands are reported in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "in several cases , we observed the same object in the same band on two separate nights during our observing run .",
    "we analyzed these data independently and found that the de vaucouleurs plus psf fits on the data from the different nights agreed well within our 1@xmath19 limits .",
    "the host galaxies of the eight bl lacs at @xmath24 were clearly resolved in our images , as they were also in the  optical survey @xcite .",
    "the three objects at larger ( @xmath25 ) redshifts were unresolved ( pks0138097 , ms0419 + 194 and pks2240260 ) so only some brief notes are presented for them in section  [ subsection : notes ] . in the  survey data ,",
    "the host of h1914194 was resolved but was consistent with both elliptical and disk morphologies .",
    "it is also resolved ( though marginally ) in the present data , but there is no robust determination of its redshift in the literature and further discussion of this object is limited to section  [ subsection : notes ] .",
    "the derived properties of several host galaxies studied previously in the h - band by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ms  2143 + 070 , h  2356309 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pks  0521365 , pks  2005489 , ms  2143 + 070 ) are in agreement with our data ( section  [ subsection : notes ] ) .",
    "the resolved hosts are large , with average half - light radius ( @xmath7 ) @xmath2 kpc .",
    "although the uncertainties on the half - light radii are large ( with the exceptions being the nearby bright galaxies in pks  0521365 and pks  2005489 ) , the derived sizes are consistent with those derived from similar nir ground - based observations by @xcite where they found @xmath26 kpc ( omitting their large value of @xmath27 kpc for pks  2254 + 074 ) . on average ,",
    "our results are also consistent within the errors with @xmath28 kpc found in the h - band nicmos study by @xcite , although the ground - based data seem to prefer smaller values .",
    "a direct comparison of the @xmath7 derived for the two objects ( ms  2143 + 070 , h  2356309 ) common to both the ground and space - based studies show that the individual values are well in agreement ( see section  [ subsection : notes ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite noted that the half - light radii derived from the  r - band survey @xcite were systematically smaller than those obtained through ground - based optical studies in their low redshift sample of eleven bl lacs .",
    "this difference is most pronounced in the largest galaxies where they suggest a combination of short exposure time and relatively small field of view of the survey data may have led to an underestimation of @xmath7 values from the .",
    "we do not find such large discrepancies in our comparison of the nir data above  our comparison actually suggests on average that the situation may be slightly reversed from what is found in the comparison of optical data , so this issue remains unresolved .",
    "bl lac host galaxies have been found to be quite luminous in optical studies @xcite , with luminosities commensurate with those of the brightest cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "our median rest - frame galaxy nir magnitudes , @xmath29 mag ( with a range of 26.9 to 25.6 ) and @xmath30 mag , are about one magnitude brighter than the characteristic magnitude for nearby non - active ellipticals ( @xmath31 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations are consistent with the h - band values found by @xcite and @xcite , and overall , confirm results from the previous optically based studies that the hosts of bl lac objects are large and luminous , but otherwise normal , elliptical galaxies .    despite the fact that we were plagued with large uncertainties in our measurements of the effective radii",
    ", we combined our k - band @xmath32 data ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) with the h - band data from @xcite and @xcite to construct a k - band kormendy relation for bl lac host galaxies .",
    "the h - band data were converted to k assuming @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this linear relation is a projection of the fundamental plane relating the half - light radius to the surface brightness at that radius @xcite . as a result",
    ", we obtained a best linear fit of @xmath5 4.3 log@xmath6 ( @xmath7/kpc ) @xmath8 mag arcsec@xmath9 to the data ( see figure  [ fig-3 ] ) .",
    "this relation is virtually identical to that derived from k - band measurements of a sample of 59 normal elliptical galaxies ( @xmath5 4.3 log@xmath6 ( @xmath7/kpc ) @xmath34 mag arcsec@xmath9 , after converting to our adopted cosmology ) by @xcite , and is consistent with the relation found previously using the h - band data only @xcite .",
    "thus , bl lac hosts and normal elliptical galaxies appear to be dynamically similar and occupy the same region of at least this projection of the fundamental plane .",
    "lastly , we fit a similar @xmath32 trend in both slope ( @xmath354.4 ) and intercept ( @xmath3513.5 ) with a fairly large scatter using the resolved and marginally resolved data for a similarly small sample of flat spectrum radio quasars @xcite .",
    "this appears at least qualitatively similar to our derived relation for bl lacs , indicating perhaps that the luminosity of the central source does not strongly influence the properties of their surrounding host galaxies .",
    "we calculated integrated rest - frame @xmath3 colors for the 8 of the 9 galaxies resolved in our observations ( neglecting h1914 - 194 , which has no measured redshift ) utilizing r - band values derived from the uniformly analyzed  survey data @xcite .",
    "the results are reported in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "additionally , we have information in two nir filters for five of these galaxies , so we were also able to calculate @xmath10 colors . to our knowledge , these are the first nir colors published for any bl lac host galaxy .",
    "we obtained average @xmath3 and @xmath10 values of @xmath36 and @xmath11 mag , respectively .",
    "these colors closely match those found in normal non - active elliptical galaxies : @xmath37 mag mag @xcite and @xmath38 mag @xcite . ] and @xmath39 mag @xcite and are in agreement with evolutionary synthesis models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "color profiles for the eight resolved galaxies are presented in figure  [ fig-4 ] .",
    "we used r - band data from the  survey @xcite and the present k - band results to compute these profiles .",
    "the bl lac host galaxies show a clear gradient in their colors , being bluer toward the periphery .",
    "this trend was previously found by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite with additional data for more objects .",
    "we computed an average slope of the profiles to be @xmath40 ( table  [ tbl-3 ] ) . compared with results from the previous nir studies",
    ", this average color gradient appears , however , to be much steeper than observed in @xmath41 .",
    "the magnitude of the average gradient values is reduced by only about one - half even when the three galaxies exhibiting extremely large gradients hovering around 2 are not considered .",
    "the large gradients we computed may be an artifact due to the quite small effective radii we fit to our nir data  our average k - band effective radius is 4.2 kpc , compared with @xmath3510 kpc in the r - band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we can not be certain of the true cause . for comparison ,",

    "<S> multi - band near - infrared images of twelve bl lacertae objects were obtained with the 2.5 m telescope at the las campanas observatory in order to determine the properties of their underlying host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> resolved emission was clearly detected in eight of the lowest redshift targets ( up to @xmath00.3 ) , and was modeled with a de vaucouleurs @xmath1 surface brightness law . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the morphologies match the elliptical galaxy profiles well , and that the bl lac objects reside in large and luminous , but otherwise normal hosts  </S>",
    "<S> consistent with previous studies done predominantly at optical wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the median absolute k - band magnitude of the galaxies in this study is 26.2 , the average half - light radius is @xmath2 kpc , and their average integrated @xmath3 color is @xmath4 mag . </S>",
    "<S> these are well within the range of values measured previously in the h - band by kotilainen et al . and scarpa et al . </S>",
    "<S> in a comparable number of targets . taking their data together with our results , we find a best - fit k - band kormendy relation of @xmath5 4.3 log@xmath6 ( @xmath7/kpc ) @xmath8 mag arcsec@xmath9 , virtually identical to that obtained for normal ellipticals . finally , the near - infrared colors determined for five galaxies ( average @xmath10 = @xmath11 mag ) are the first such measurements for bl lac hosts , and match those expected from old stellar populations at the bl lac redshifts . </S>"
