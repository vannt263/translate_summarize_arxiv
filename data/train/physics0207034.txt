    "the process of flame propagation presents an extremely complicated mathematical problem .",
    "the governing equations include the nonlinear flow equations for the fuel and the products of combustion , as well as the transport equations governing the heat conduction and species diffusion inside the flame front .",
    "fortunately , in practice , an inner flame scale defined by the latter processes is large compared to the flame front thickness , implying that the flame can be considered as a gasdynamic discontinuity .",
    "the initial problem is reduced thereby to a purely hydrodynamic problem of determining the propagation of a surface of discontinuity in an incompressible fluid , the laws of this propagation being determined by the usual navier - stokes and continuity equations complemented by the jump conditions at the surface , expressing the mass and momentum conservation across the flame front .",
    "the asymptotic methods developed in refs .",
    "@xcite allow one to express these conditions in the form of a power series with respect to the small flame front thickness .    despite this considerable progress",
    ", however , a closed theoretical description of the flame propagation is still lacking .",
    "what is meant by the term `` closed description '' here is the description of flame dynamics as dynamics of the flow variables _ on _ the flame front surface .",
    "reduction of the system of bulk equations and jump conditions , mentioned above , to this `` surface dynamics '' implies solving the flow equations for the fuel and the combustion products , satisfying given boundary conditions and the jump conditions at the flame front , and has only been carried out asymptotically for the case @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gas expansion coefficient defined as the ratio of the fuel density and the density of burnt matter @xcite .    difficulties encountered in trying to obtain a closed description of flames are conditioned by the following two crucial aspects :    \\(1 ) characterized by the flow velocities which are typically well below the speed of sound , deflagration represents an essentially nonlocal process , in the sense that the flame - induced gas flows , both up- and downstream , strongly affect the flame front structure itself . a seeding role in this reciprocal process",
    "is played by the landau - darrieus ( ld ) instability of zero thickness flames @xcite",
    ". a very important factor of non - locality of the flame propagation is the vorticity production in the flame , which highly complicates the flow structure downstream . in particular",
    ", the local relation between pressure and velocity fields upstream , expressed by the bernoulli equation , no longer holds for the flow variables downstream .",
    "\\(2 ) deflagration is a highly nonlinear process which requires an adequate non - perturba- + tive description of flames with arbitrary values of the flame front slope . as a result of development of the ld - instability , exponentially growing perturbations with arbitrary wavelengths make any initially smooth flame front configuration corrugated .",
    "characteristic size of the resulting `` cellular '' structure is of the order of the cutoff wavelength @xmath2 given by the linear theory of the ld - instability @xcite ; @xmath3 is the flame front thickness .",
    "the exponential growth of unstable modes is ultimately suppressed by the nonlinear effects . since for arbitrary @xmath1",
    "the governing equations do not contain small parameters , it is clear that the ld - instability can only be suppressed by the nonlinear effects if the latter are not small , and therefore so is the flame front slope .",
    "the stabilizing role of the nonlinear effects is best illustrated in the case of stationary flame propagation .",
    "numerical experiments on 2d flames with @xmath4 show that even in very narrow tubes ( tube width of the order @xmath5 ) , typical values for the flame front slope are about @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "nonlinearity can be considered small only in the case of small gas expansion , @xmath0 where one has the @xmath7 estimate for the slope , so that it is possible to derive an equation for the flame front position in the framework of the perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this perturbative method gives results in a reasonable agreement with the experiment only for flames with @xmath9 propagating in very narrow tubes ( tube width of the order @xmath5 ) , so that the front slope does not exceed unity .",
    "flames of practical importance , however , have @xmath1 up to 10 , and propagate in tubes much wider than @xmath10 as a result of development of the ld - instability , such flames turn out to be highly curved , which leads to a noticeable increase of the flame velocity . in connection with this , a natural question arises whether it is possible to develop a non - perturbative approach to the flame dynamics , closed in the sense mentioned above , which would be applicable to flames with arbitrary gas expansion .",
    "a deeper root of this problem is the following _ dilemma : _ on the one hand , flame propagation is an essentially non - local process [ see the point ( 1 ) above ] , on the other , this non - locality itself is determined by the flame front configuration and the structure of gas flows near the front , so the question is whether an explicit bulk structure of the flow downstream is necessary in deriving an equation for the flame front position . in other words ,",
    "we look for an approach which would provide the closed description of flames more directly , without the need to solve the flow equations explicitly .    the purpose of this paper is to develop such approach in the stationary case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the flow equations and related results needed in our investigation are displayed in sec .",
    "[ flowequations ] .",

    ", this result allows one to write down a system of equations for the flow variables and the flame front position , which is closed in the above - mentioned sense .",

    "it is remarkable that this system turns out to be quasi - local , which implies existence of the transverse representation derived in sec .",

    "[ discussion ] .",
    "as was mentioned in the point ( 1 ) of introduction , an important factor of the flow non - locality downstream is the vorticity production in curved flames , which highly complicates relations between the flow variables . in the presence of vorticity",
    ", pressure is expressed through the velocity field by an integral relation , its kernel being the green function of the laplace operator .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the jump condition for the pressure across the flame front only serves as the boundary condition for determining an appropriate green function , being useless in other respects .",
    "thus , it is convenient to exclude pressure from our consideration from the very beginning .",
    "the basis for this is provided by the well - known thomson circulation theorem .",
    "thus , we begin in sec .",
    "[ flowequations ] with the standard formulation of the problem of flame propagation , and then construct a formal implicit solution of the flow equations with the help of this theorem in sec .",
    "[ integral ] .",
    "let us consider a stationary flame propagating in an initially uniform premixed ideal fluid in a tube of arbitrary width @xmath11 to make the mathematics of our approach more transparent , we will be dealing below with the 2d case .",
    "let the cartesian coordinates @xmath12 be chosen so that @xmath13-axis is parallel to the tube walls , @xmath14 being in the fresh fuel .",
    "it will be convenient to introduce the following dimensionless variables @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the velocity of a plane flame front , @xmath18 is the initial pressure in the fuel far ahead of the flame front , and @xmath19 is some characteristic length of the problem ( e.g. , the cut - off wavelength ) .",
    "the fluid density will be normalized on the fuel density @xmath20 as always , we assume that the process of flame propagation is nearly isobaric .",
    "then the velocity and pressure fields obey the following equations in the bulk @xmath21 where @xmath22 and summation over repeated indices is implied .",
    "acting on eq .",
    "( [ flow2 ] ) by the operator @xmath23 where @xmath24 and using eq .",
    "( [ flow1 ] ) , one obtains a 2d version of the thomson circulation theorem @xmath25 where @xmath26 according to eq .",
    "( [ thomson ] ) , the voticity @xmath27 is conserved along the stream lines . as a simple consequence of this theorem , one can find the general solution of the flow equations upstream .",
    "namely , since the flow is potential at @xmath28 ( @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the velocity of the flame in the rest frame of reference of the fuel ) , it is potential for every @xmath32 @xmath33 denoting the flame front position .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 where the linear hilbert operator @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 and @xmath37 the boundary condition @xmath38 at the tube walls ( @xmath39 ) implies that the coefficients @xmath40 are all real , @xmath41 it will be shown in the next section how the thomson theorem can be used to obtain a formal integral of the flow equations downstream .",

    "( [ vint ] ) represent the potential component of the fluid velocity , while the third corresponds to the vortex component .",
    "the aim of the subsequent calculation is to transform the latter to an integral over the flame front surface . to this end",
    ", we will decompose @xmath60 into elementary @xmath44 as follows .",
    "let us take a couple of stream lines crossing the flame front at points @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "consider the gas elements moving between these lines , which cross the front between the time instants @xmath63 and @xmath64 during this time interval , these elements fill a space element @xmath65 adjacent to the flame front .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath66 the volume of @xmath65 @xmath67 where @xmath68 the subscript``@xmath69 '' means that the corresponding quantity is evaluated just behind the flame front , _",
    "i.e. , _ for @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the normal velocity of the burnt gas , @xmath72 being the unit vector normal to the flame front ( pointing to the burnt matter ) .",
    "after another time interval of the same duration @xmath73 the elements move to a space element @xmath74 adjacent to @xmath75 since the flow is incompressible , @xmath74 is of the same volume as @xmath75 continuing this , the space between the two stream lines turns out to be divided into an infinite sequence of @xmath60 s of the same volume , adjacent to each other .",
    "thus , summing over all @xmath76 the third term in eq .",
    "( [ vint ] ) can be written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the flame front surface ( the front line in our 2d case ) , @xmath79 and @xmath80 trajectory of a particle crossing the point @xmath81 at @xmath82    substituting expression ( [ vint1 ] ) into eq .",

    "( [ solup1 ] ) , ( [ solup2 ] ) for all @xmath84 given the solution upstream , velocity components of the burnt gas at the flame front can be found from the jump conditions which express the mass and momentum conservation across the front . on the other hand ,",

    "any velocity field can be arbitrarily decomposed into a potential and vortex modes .",
