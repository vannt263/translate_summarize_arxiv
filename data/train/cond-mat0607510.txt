    "the continuous downscaling of mosfet critical dimensions such as the gate length and the gate oxide thickness has been a very successful trend in current manufacturing , as testified , e.g. ,  by the itrs requirements .",
    "however , conventional scaling down of mosfet s channel length is declining as the physical and economic limits of such an approach are coming closer .",
    "novel solutions are increasingly being used in mosfet channel engineering .",
    "the growth of a strained si layer on a relaxed si@xmath3ge@xmath5 buffer layer is a typical technique used to improve the electrical performances of mosfet s device , due to the expected enhancements in the carrier mobility  @xcite of such a strained layer .",
    "high - performance strained si@xmath1ge@xmath6 transistors have been recently obtained and this technology could feature in future chip generation with channel size of 32 nm or less  @xcite . when modeling the electrical currents of such devices , it is required to take into account the fundamental transport properties of the charge carriers that are governed by the structure of the electronic energy bands of the strained material .",
    "material science computational methods for the calculation of the electronic energy band structure fall into two general categories .",
    "the first category includes the ab initio methods , such as hartree - fock or density functional theory ( dft ) , which calculate the electronic structure from first principles , i.e. ,  without the need for empirical parameters .",
    "the second category consists of far more computationally efficient semiempirical methods such as the empirical pseudopotential method ( epm ) , the tight binding ( tb ) method and the @xmath0  method .    over the past decades , the local density approximation ( lda ) variant of dft",
    "@xcite has been established as a very powerful tool for studying the elastic properties and the deformation potentials of strained semiconductors  @xmath7 .",
    "more recently , the gw many - body - correction to the lda dft@xcite has yielded semiconductors band structures that feature band gap values near their experimental values .",
    "ab initio methods are self - consistent methods which utilize a variant approach to calculate the ground state energy of a many - body system and thus require large computer resources .",
    "they can only be used in particular situations of high symmetries and are not suitable for calculating the transport properties of large systems with confined edge states .    unlike ab initio approaches , epm , tb and the @xmath0  method involve fitting parameters to reproduce the experimental energy band gaps , the dielectric response and the carrier effective masses . over the past three decades",
    ", the epm with spin - orbit ( so ) corrections has proven to be extremely successful in calculating the electronic band structure of relaxed and strained semiconductors with indirect gap@xcite .",
    "recent works using the tb method have also given accurate results@xcite .",
    "in the @xmath0  method , the energy band structure is obtained by a set of parameters which represent the energy gaps at @xmath8 , the momentum matrix elements and the strength of the so coupling .",
    "the number of energy bands ( or levels ) that are effectively calculated is related to the precision of the results .",
    "six - level @xmath0  model@xcite , eight - level @xmath0  model and fourteen - level @xmath0  model@xcite describe well the highest valence bands ( vbs ) and the lowest conduction bands ( cbs ) of semiconductors near the center @xmath8 of the brillouin zone , but fail to describe the cbs of semiconductors with indirect gap .",
    "low - order @xmath0  hamiltonians need a small number of parameters ( typically less than 10 ) , while high - order @xmath0   methods@xcite , referred by pollak et al.@xcite as `` full - zone '' @xmath0  methods , require a large number of unknown parameters .",
    "while it is a straightforward matter to work out the energy - band structure at any @xmath9-point in the brillouin zone once these parameters have been chosen , it requires effort and skill to come up with a satisfactory set of parameters@xcite . for this reason ,",
    "the full - zone @xmath0  method has been used rarely and for a few _ bulk _ semiconductors only , including si , ge  @xcite and @xmath10-sn  @xcite , while no extensive works were performed for strained semiconductors .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to extend to strained si , ge and sige alloys the thirty - level @xmath0  model that was firstly introduced by cardona et al .",
    "cardona s model is based on the 15 orbital states referred to @xmath8 .",
    "for the first time , the well - known pikus and bir  @xcite correction for strained materials has been combined within this thirty - level @xmath0  formalism .",
    "the @xmath0  parameter optimization strategy is based on a conjugate - gradient procedure that uses ab initio simulations but also a large amount of experimental data that is currently available for si and ge .    in the first part of this paper , a series of ab initio dft - lda simulations that include the gw correction and relativistic effects in strained si@xmath1ge@xmath6/si@xmath3ge@xmath5 systems has been performed with a view to complete the experimental data and to establish a reference set of energy bands .    in the second part of this paper , we have determined the @xmath0  model coupling parameters and the deformation potentials that fit as close as possible the first principle results , matching not only the energy levels and the carrier effective masses , but also the general shape of the band structure of relaxed and strained crystals .",
    "a simple interpolation between the @xmath0  parameters for si and those for ge has been proposed in order to model sige alloys .    in the third part of this paper , a set of comparison",
    "is given with experimental data in relaxed and strained si , ge , and si@xmath1ge@xmath6 alloys .",
    "we show that the present @xmath0  model accurately reproduces the overall band structure , as well as the band shifts , the carrier effective masses and the density of states ( dos ) _ vs. _ applied strain . a second set of comparisons with the widely used chelikowsly and cohen non - local epm @xcite has also shown a good agreement with @xmath0  simulations .",
    "a series of first principle calculations has been performed in si and ge to obtain a reference set of energy bands , which can be used later for the @xmath0  model parameters optimization .",
    "the first principle data presented in this work have been obtained within the lda variant of the dft  @xcite .",
    "the present dft - lda calculation relies on the pseudopotential ( pp ) approximation , by which the core states are effectively eliminated from the calculation .",
    "we have used the well - known published hartwigsen - goedecker - hutter relativistic separable dual - space gaussian pp s  @xcite that uses cerperley and alder exchange - correlation functional  @xcite .",
    "these pps include relativistic effects and provide an accurate description of the top vb in the near @xmath8-region , a critical region with respect to the hole transport properties in semiconductors .",
    "the value of the equilibrium lattice parameter has been calculated by minimizing the total energy .",
    "any further lda calculation has used this theoretical value , instead of the experimental one  @xcite , yielding thus a consistent set of zero - pressure reference data . in si",
    ", we found a@xmath11=5.387 @xmath12 , and in ge a@xmath11=5.585 @xmath12 .",
    "these values agree within @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the experimental values of 5.431 @xmath12 and 5.658 @xmath12  @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is known that the band gaps calculated with the lda method are generally below their experimental values .",
    "however , the agreement can be greatly improved by the use of the hedin s gw correction  @xcite . in practice",
    "this correction can be applied as a post - dft scheme  @xcite in a non self - consistent way . in the following work ,",
    "the g@xmath11w@xmath11 correction of bulk si and ge were computed on 19 high - symmetry points in the brillouin zone and added in a perturbative manner to the lda band structure .",
    "one remark deserves notice : in spite of the g@xmath11w@xmath11 correction , the theoretical lowest cb typically lie within 0.05 - 0.2 ev of the range of experimental energies observed  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "the g@xmath11w@xmath11 theoretical indirect gaps have been found to be 1.076 ev in si ( located at @xmath15 away from @xmath8 along the @xmath8-x direction ) and 0.64 ev in ge , which is underestimated by 8@xmath16 and 14@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "our results compare favorably with other lda - gw results found in literature ( e.g. ,  see the extensive comparison between first principle calculations summarized in aulbur et al .",
    "review  @xcite ) .",
    "eventhough correctly parametrized , lda - g@xmath11w@xmath11 results do not match _ perfectly _ with experimental data , and significant theoretical work such as vertex correction , self - consistent - gw and the exact treatment of exchange term are currently in progress to further improve dft results  @xcite .",
    "these alternative approaches are beyond the scope of the present work . for the purpose of obtaining reference set of energy bands that can be used in the development of an optimized @xmath0  model",
    ", we used the non self - consistent g@xmath11w@xmath11 approximation to correct the band gap problem and we applied a supplementary rigid `` squizor '' shift of 0.09 ev for si and 0.104 ev for ge in order to obtain the final reference set of energy bands , the gw energy levels  @xcite .    aside from the above studies , the accuracy of the dft - lda calculation critically depends on the manner in which the problem is sampled numerically  @xcite .",
    "we found out good lda convergence ( @xmath17  @xmath18  0.01  ev ) using a basis set of approximatively 1300 - 1500 plane waves , which corresponds to a cut - off energy of around 22 hartrees .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled on a 6 * 6 * 6 four - fold shifted monkhorst and pack grid  @xcite ( i.e. , 864 @xmath9-points ) to obtain the charge density .",
    "as regard g@xmath11w@xmath11 correction , a satisfactory trade - off between numerical convergence and computation time was achieved with a cut - off energy of 8 hartrees and using a large number of bands ( @xmath19 100 ) included in the calculation of the self - energy  @xcite .      in si@xmath2ge@xmath1 , where @xmath20 denotes the relative mole fraction of the two materials , both si and ge atoms are present in the unit cell .",
    "for this reason , we used a 32-atoms tetragonal cell to simulate sige alloys ( a 2-atoms orthorombic unit cell was used for si and ge ) .",
    "the si and ge atoms have been randomly distributed in the super - cell and a structural optimization of the atomic positions in the unit cell has been performed .",
    "a linear interpolation between the gw correction of si and ge was used to correct the band gap .",
    "this latter approximation is reasonable because the gw correction obtained in si and ge are effectively very close @xcite .",
    "the experimental lattice parameter in si@xmath2ge@xmath1 is well described by the dismukes s law  @xcite according to which @xmath21 is a quadratic function of @xmath20 .",
    "a similar expression has been obtained from our theoretical results at various @xmath20-content : @xmath22      epitaxial si@xmath1ge@xmath2 layers grown on a relaxed si@xmath3ge@xmath4 buffer is studied with a view to fitting the deformation potential parameters of the @xmath0  model for strained materials that will be presented hereafter .",
    "a series of first principle simulations of the electronic band structure has been performed for a large range of biaxial strain ( up to 4 @xmath16 ) applied perpendicularly to the [ 001 ] , [ 111 ] and [ 110 ] directions .    using continuum elasticity theory , the strain tensor in the layer in the case of [ 100]-buffer writes ,    @xmath23    in the case of [ 110]-buffer ,    @xmath24    and in the case of [ 111]-buffer : @xmath25 where the longitudinal strain @xmath26 depends on the slight difference between the cubic lattice parameter in the buffer ( @xmath27 ) and the longitudinal one in the layer ( @xmath28 ) .",

    "the poisson ratios d determine the displacements of atomic plans along the normal [ 001 ] , [ 111 ] and [ 110 ] directions , in order to minimize the normal stress .",
    "the knowledge of the elastic constants of the material is not enough to infer the position of the atoms in the unit cell .",
    "an additional degree of freedom ( that occurs notably for shear distortion ) must be added to the displacement of the atoms  @xcite .",
    "the internal strain parameters @xmath30 , which measure how the distance between the two atoms in the unit cell changes in response to the symmetry - breaking stress , are known experimentally in si and ge uniaxially strained along the [ 111 ] direction  @xcite ( and are quoted in table  [ tab : elastic ] ) .",
