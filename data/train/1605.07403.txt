    "from glass windows and light bulbs to lenses and fiberglass insulation , advances in glass science and technology have indisputably played a vital role in enabling modern civilization .",
    "the performances of every glass product , especially high - technology glasses such as optical fibers , amorphous phase change dvds or scratch - resistant flat panel displays including cell - phones , are governed by underlying properties of the glass at the atomic scale .    what is a glass ?",
    "this important question is poorly understood , and remains unanswered today beyond the level of general statements , albeit substantial progress in understanding has been made in the recent years . solving this problem represents a great challenge for the science , technology , engineering communities at large with obvious technological applications , and has led to an intense research activity that spans over vast fields of inquiry , from theoretical physics of liquids to materials science . when a high temperature liquid can be cooled fast enough , it will usually be able to avoid cristallisation at the melting temperature @xmath5 and will become `` _ supercooled _ '' , which represents a thermodynamic metastable state with respect to the corresponding cristal . at very high temperatures , relaxation times to equilibrium",
    "are found to be of the order of the typical atomic vibrational period , i.e. of about @xmath6=0.1 - 1ps , whereas the viscosity @xmath7 is of the order of 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath9  pa.s .",
    "once the melting temperature has been bypassed , upon further cooling the viscosity and the relaxation time increase dramatically to reach @xmath10 100s-1000s and @xmath7=10@xmath11  pa.s at a reference temperature that is defined in the literature as the glass transition temperature @xmath12 .",
    "this empirical definition simply signals that below @xmath12 , a liquid will be too viscous to flow on a laboratory timescale ( i.e. days or years @xcite ) , and the obtained material will be identified with a glass , i.e. a material that displays all the salient microscopic features of a liquid of but has the macroscopic characteristics of a solid .",
    "once a glass has been obtained , there is , however , still thermal evolution towards equilibrium but its complete experimental study is partially out of reach so that glasses are usually considered as being `` _ out off equilibrium _ '' . as a result",
    ", properties will evolve slowly with time , and measurements will depend on the waiting time at which they have begun , a phenomenon known as `` _ ageing _ '' .    of very special interest is the field of network glasses ( fig .",
    "[ zach ] ) , probably the most familiar and , historically , those which have attracted early interest .",
    "this is due , in part , to the effect of the x - ray determined structure at the local , intermediate or long range order which has appeared to be central to the understanding of many chemical physical properties including those revealing the slowing down of the dynamics .",
    "appropriate ( stoichiometric ) mixtures of group iii - group v elements ( e.g. silicon , boron , germanium , ... ) with group vi oxydes and chalcogenides ( oxygen , sulphur , selenium ) lead indeed to a network structure that is imposed at the very local level by building geometrical blocks typical of a short range order @xcite , e.g. the sio@xmath13 tetrahedron in silicates .",
    "the disordered arrangement of such building blocks on longer scales is then representative of glasses wich form a highly cross - linked network of chemical bonds .",
    "addition of alkali and alkaline earth modifiers alter the network structure , and while such elements are usually present as ions , they compensate by nearby non - bridging group vi atoms which induce a disruption of the network structure . the presence of such non - bridging atoms lowers the relative number of strong bonds in the glass , and , in the liquid state , will lead to an important modification of the melt viscosity , relaxation time , and various dynamic quantities .",
    "in fact , an appropriate alloying of such components permits one to tune dynamic quantities of glass forming liquids in a nearly systematic fashion , allowing for the detection of anomalies which provide an increased insight into the glass transition phenomenon .    in this contribution , we review experimental and theoretical methods and studies that have been reported recently on relaxation and ageing of network glasses .",
    "because of lack of space , and although some reported features may have an intrinsic interest for the purpose , we will most of the time discard the vast body of literature on the relaxation of sphere liquids interacting with very simple potentials that are not `` _ realistic _ '' for any physical system .",
    "while non - equilibrium processes have been rather well characterized and some generic behavior revealed from such crude models , the simplifed form of the interaction ( in short , a repulsive core and an attractive interaction at long distances ) are unable to reproduce basic features and structural properties of network glasses which are dominated by specific diffraction patterns for which all the details matter .",
    "this makes the correct structural reproduction a prerequisite to any theoretical description . for such glasses , aspects of structure control , indeed , a large part of the dynamics and the relaxation phenomena taking place in the vicinity of the glass transition",
    "however , as emphasized above , glassiness is not restricted to the archetypal silica system and/or to inorganic glasses because sugars , food , organic polymers , and more generally complex disordered systems will display this phenomenon as well , while the glass transition can be also achieved through an appropriate densification , and this indicates that glassy behavior can be also observed under jamming @xcite .",
    "although all quantities remain continuous across the glass transition , rapid changes in physical , thermal , rheological , mechanical etc .",
    "properties are observed .",
    "as the temperature increases from low temperature to above the glass transition temperature , many of these properties suddenly change , indeed , and manifest e.g. by important variations in heat capacity , thermal expansion coefficient and/or viscoelastic properties .",
    "there are two broad classes of measurements based either on rheological properties ( viscosity @xmath7 and modulus @xmath14 ) or on thermal and thermodynamic properties ( enthalpy @xmath15 , volume @xmath16 , heat capacity @xmath17 , and expansion coefficient @xmath18 ) , the latter usually allowing for a neat measurement of the glass transition temperature @xmath12 from calorimetric / dilatometric measurements , as discussed below .",
    "the evolution of viscosity ( @xmath7 ) is probably one of the most spectacular observed changes as the melt is cooled down to its glass transition . in fig .",
    "[ visc]a are represented the evolution of the viscosity for different network - forming liquids ( selenium , silica , germania , gese@xmath19 , ... ) which can be formed in the supercooled state .",
    "these are also compared to other prototypal glass forming liquids .",
    "it is seen that the increase of viscosity is dramatic for certain substances , and , for organic glass - formers such as o - terphenyl ( otp ) or toluene , the temperature decrease can lead to a change in @xmath7 by several orders of magnitudes under only tens of degrees temperature change .",
    "the behavior of network glass - forming viscosities with t appears to be more moderate , although similar viscosities ( 10@xmath11  pa.s ) are obtained at a reference temperature @xmath12 that is usually found to be somewhat higher than the one of organic glass - forming liquids .",
    "this temperature usually serves to rescale the viscosity data in an appropriate plot , initially introduced by laughlin and uhlmann @xcite , and subsequently popularized by angell @xcite .    in this plot ,",
    "the inverse temperature is rescaled with respect to this reference @xmath12 at which the liquid reaches 10@xmath11  pa.s , and the same viscosity data of fig .",
    "[ visc]a are now shown in fig .",
    "an immediate inspection of this figure leads to the conclusion that such supercooled liquids behave very differently close to their glass transition .",
    "some of them show a behavior @xmath20 that follows an arrhenius law of the form @xmath7=@xmath21 $ ] , and typical examples are silica and germania @xcite or gese@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "however , as one moves downwards in the figure , other liquids ( e.g. b@xmath3o@xmath4 , 2sio@xmath3-na@xmath3o , as@xmath3se@xmath4 or se ) now exhibit a viscosity behavior that shows an important bending @xcite at intermediate values of @xmath22 , whereas organic glass - formers ( otp and toluene ) display the most pronounced curvature and must involve a super - arrhenius parametrization of the form @xmath7=@xmath23 $ ] where the activation energy @xmath24 must now explicitely depends on temperature .",
    "a simple means to separate liquids for which @xmath24 and the underlying relaxation is independent of temperature from those having an explicit temperature dependence , @xmath25 , and exhibiting a rapid increase of @xmath7 close to @xmath22=1 , is provided by the `` _ strong _ '' versus `` _ fragile _ '' classification which permits to distinguish the two types of behaviors @xcite .",
    "this has led to the introduction of a `` fragility index '' @xmath26 which is defined by the slope of @xmath27 vs @xmath22 at @xmath12 : @xmath28_{t = t_g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as detected from fig .",
    "[ visc]b , large slopes will , indeed , correspond to fragile glass - formers displaying an important curvature , a variable @xmath25 and a rapid evolution of @xmath7 as one approaches @xmath12 , while small slopes ( i.e. small @xmath26 ) will correspond to strong glass - formers having a nearly arrhenius variation involving a constant @xmath24 . once examined over a wide variety of glass forming liquids @xcite , @xmath26 is found to vary between a high value @xcite of @xmath26=214 for a polymer to a low value @xcite of 14.8 for the network - forming liquid ge@xmath29se@xmath30 , a value that is actually found to be lower than the usual reported value of silica ( @xmath26=20 @xcite ) .",
    "note also that the terms introduced `` _ strong _ '' and `` _ fragile _ '' are somewhat inappropriate given that they neither connect to underlying mechanical properties , nor to the possible inter - atomic interactions , although most of the strong glass formers have a directional iono - covalent interaction but exceptions do exist @xcite .",
    "alternative to the definition ( [ frag ] ) , several fragility indexes have been introduced to characterise the viscosity behavior of liquids , such as the bruning- sutton @xcite , avramov @xcite and doremus @xcite fragility parameters .",
    "all attempt to obtain within a single parameter the curvature or slope of the viscosity curves .",
    "for instance , the bruning - sutton approach @xcite prefers to relate the viscosity behavior of supercooled liquids with an apparent activation energy for viscous flow which is either constant ( for strong liquids ) or highly temperature dependent for fragile liquids close to the glass transition .    at high temperature , most of the liquids seem to converge to a value that is close to @xmath31=10@xmath8  pa.s .",
    "an analysis of viscosity curves @xcite using a convenient fitting formula for silicate liquids and other liquids including metallic , molecular , and ionic systems , has shown that the high - temperature viscosity limit of such liquids is about 10@xmath32  pa.s @xcite .",
    "as there seems to be no systematic dependence of @xmath31 on composition , at least for the silicates given the narrow spread around the average value of 10@xmath32  pa.s , it is believed that @xmath31 has some kind of a universal character .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed by russell and co - workers @xcite using alternative fitting formulas for a series of silicate melts , and the prediction of the high temperature viscosity limit has been found to be of about 10@xmath33  pa.s to 10@xmath34  pa.s . while this issue may be considered as secondary for the present purpose , the degree of universality of @xmath31 appears to be central to the validity of proposed viscosity fitting formulae ( see below ) which all assume a universal high temperature limit of viscosity @xmath31 to derive the low temperature behavior of @xmath20 close to the glass transition .",
    "given the highly non - linear behavior of viscosity with temperature , the departure from an arrhenius scaling ( fig .",
    "[ visc]b ) reflects the influence of the second derivative of @xmath7 with respect to the inverse temperature that might involve a high temperature parametrized limit embedded in @xmath31 , and not only the effect of the low temperature behavior . as seen from equ .",
    "( [ frag ] ) , a non - arrhenius character can , indeed , be solely parametrized with the fragility index , @xmath26 , but the latter is a low temperature quantity representing only a first - derivative of the viscosity curve at tg .",
    "the temperature dependence of the viscosity data ( or relaxation time given that one has @xmath35 with @xmath36 the infinite frequency bulk modulus ) is often described approximatively by convenient fitting functionals .",
    "the most popular one is given by the vogel - tammann - fulcher ( vft ) equation @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 has the dimension of an activation energy , and @xmath39 a reference temperature that leads to an arrhenius behavior for @xmath40 .",
    "an alternative and maybe more insightful form of the vft equation ( [ equ_vft ] ) using explicitely the fragility and the glass transition temperature @xmath12 writes : @xmath41 it should be noted that for @xmath42 , the viscosity will become infinite , and this might indicate some sort of phase transition on which there has been quite some speculation and debate .",
    "for instance , it has been stated that @xmath39 is very close to the kauzmann temperature @xmath43 @xcite , a temperature at which the excess entropy of the liquid with respect to the corresponding crystal is supposed to vanish .",
    "this connects the kinetic view of the glass transition represented by the evolution of @xmath20 with a thermodynamic one .",
    "however , this `` _ entropy crisis _ '' is rather counterintuituive because one does not expect to have the entropy of a glass becoming lower than the one of the corresponding crystal .",
    "in addition , upon further cooling , one neither expects the entropy of a liquid to become negative which would violate the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "however , apart from the obvious argument stating that an ordered state of matter ( the liquid ) should not have an entropy lower than the corresponding ordered state ( the crystal ) , there is no general principle ruling the various contributions of liquid- and solid - like materials so that this apparent paradox may well be consistent with the current experimental observation showing the entropy to vary in very similar fashion to first derivatives of the free energy , without indication that it extrapolates to zero at some finite temperature .    in a rather systematic study on different glass formers , richert and angell @xcite have shown that the ratio @xmath44 is very close to the one for fragile glass - formers but for common network glasses ( sio@xmath3 , geo@xmath3 ) which are strong glass - formers and have @xmath45  0 , the fit of the viscosity behavior using equ .",
    "( [ equ_vft ] ) and its connection to the kauzmann temperature , appears to be non conclusive .",
    "however , a fit on ge - se liquids using the vft form has shown that @xmath39 goes through a minimum for 22  % ge @xcite , i.e. at the same composition at which a fragility minimum has been measured @xcite .",
    "since the discusion about the relationship between @xmath39 and @xmath43 depends on the functional used for the viscosity / relaxation time fitting , conclusions regarding the validity of @xmath46 can be quite contradictory @xcite    an interesting and insightful link between the configurational entropy of the liquid and the relaxation ( or viscosity ) has been suggested by adam and gibbs @xcite @xmath47\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ adam_gibbs ] ) which is central to many investigations of the glass transition ( see below ) provides an important connection between a kinetic and a thermodynamic viewpoint of the glass transition . in the latter , the configurational entropy variation with decreasing temperature is believed to result from the reduction of the number of possible minima in the complex energy landscape @xcite characterizing the material . according to this picture , the slowing down of the relaxation , the dramatic increase of @xmath6 , result from the reduced ability of the system to explore the landscape in order to locate the energy minimum , driven by the strong reduction of the number of accessible energy minima as the temperature is decreased .",
    "ultimately , structural arrest might occur , and since for an ideal glass at @xmath48 one has a single energy minimum only , the configurational entropy vanishes and the relaxation time diverges .",
    "there is actually not necessarily need to have a functional displaying a diverging behavior at some typical / critical temperature @xmath39 .",
    "other popular fitting functionals can reproduce the non - exponentiality of the temperature evolution of viscosity , for example the bssler law @xcite : @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which yields a curvature in the angell representation of liquids , or the avramov - milchev @xcite form : @xmath50    where @xmath18 is the avramov fragility parameter @xcite which is equal to @xmath18=1 for strong liquids , whereas liquids with higher @xmath18 values become more fragile .",
    "most of these models lead to a systematic error when they are extrapolated to low temperatures .",
    "a more recent and interesting contribution is due to mauro and co - workers @xcite which provide a viscosity model with a clear physical foundation based on the temperature dependence of the configurational entropy .",
    "it offers an accurate prediction of low - temperature isokoms without any singularity at finite temperature . using the adam - gibbs model for viscosity ( equ .",
    "( [ adam_gibbs ] ) ) , the configurational entropy can be expressed as a function of topological degrees of freedom @xcite ( see below ) that are temperature dependent and thermally activated @xcite , and this leads to the mauro - yue - ellison - gupta - allan ( myega ) equation : @xmath51\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which avoids a divergence at low temperature found in the vft equation ( fig .",
    "[ visc_compar ] .",
    "( [ myega ] ) ) , and has been tested and compared to alternative viscosity forms ( including vft ) over a hundred of network glass - forming liquids ( silicates ) and organic supercooled liquids .",
    "given the huge number of possible compositions and thermodynamic conditions , it is nearly impossible to provide a full database of viscosity measurements for network glass - forming liquids .",
    "useful references are the handbooks of borisova @xcite and mazurin @xcite for oxides and chalcogenides , and the handbook of popescu on chalcogenides @xcite . instead , we prefer focusing in the forthcoming on reported correlations between the fragility index @xmath26 and some insightful physical or chemical properties .",
    "an interesting scaling law relating the fragility index to the glass transition temperature is provided by mckenna and co - workers @xcite .",
    "there is indeed conventional wisdom suggesting that fragility increases with the glass transition temperature @xcite which implicitly underscores the fact that energy barriers for relaxation increase with increasing t@xmath52 .",
    "the derivation of this scaling law combines e.g. the vft form of equ .",
    "( [ equ_vft ] ) , and the definition of the fragility ( equ .",
    "( [ frag ] ) ) , and calculates the fragility and the activation energy @xmath24 as a function of the glass transition temperature .",
    "one obtains : @xmath53 and : @xmath54 because @xmath12 is of the same order as @xmath39 , equs .",
    "( [ cor1 ] ) and ( [ cor2 ] ) reveal that @xmath26 and @xmath55 will scale with @xmath12 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "note that this scaling law can be also independently derived from alternative fitting forms for the viscosity , such as the similar williams - landel - ferry form @xcite .",
    "using such scaling laws , qin and mckenna @xcite have shown that the correlations ( [ cor1])-([cor2 ] ) are fulfilled in a large class of hydrogen bonding organics , polymeric and metallic glass formers .",
    "all these systems show a linear increase of @xmath26 with t@xmath52 , and @xmath55 with @xmath56 , whereas network glass formers do not seem to follow such scaling laws . from this study",
    ", @xmath26 appears to be nearly independent of the glass transition temperature for the reported inorganic glass formers @xcite .",
    "but , in a systematic study with composition on chalcogenides , boolchand and co - workers @xcite have demonstrated that this scaling holds in network glasses @xcite at select compositions .",
    "figure [ scaling ] represents the behavior of the fragility index @xmath26 as a function of measured glass transition temperature @xmath12 for various network - forming glasses .",
    "an inspection of as@xmath1se@xmath2 and ge@xmath1se@xmath2 chalcogenides shows that when the off - stoichiometric melts are followed as a function of tiny changes in composition , the scalings laws ( [ cor1])-([cor2 ] ) are fulfilled for only selected compositions corresponding to the stressed rigid and intermediate phase compositions ( see below ) of these glasses @xcite , i.e. one has a linear increase in @xmath26(@xmath12 ) for @xmath5722% in ge - se @xcite , and for @xmath5727% in as - se @xcite",
    ". a least - square fit to such compositions yields to @xmath26=-7.53(5)+0.061(7)@xmath12 and to @xmath26=-17.356 + 0.060(1)@xmath12 for as - se and ge - se , respectively @xcite .",
    "the slope of both curves ( @xmath58 0.06 ) is found to be somewhat lower than the one obtained @xcite in polymers ( 0.28 ) , metallic glass - formers ( 0.17 ) , and hydrogen bonded liquids ( 0.25 ) .    for low glass transition temperatures ( i.e. selenium rich in ge - se or as - se ) ,",
    "a negative correlation is found which obviously can not be accounted from the vft equation given that it would lead to unphysical behaviors such as the divergence of relaxation at a temperature @xmath59 or an increase of relaxation time @xmath6 with temperature @xcite .",
    "it has been furthermore detected @xcite that only the vft equation ( [ vft ] ) can lead to a positive correlation in the scaling law ( [ cor1 ] ) .",
    "for other fitting formula such as the the simple arrhenius law @xmath26=@xmath60 or the myega equation ( [ myega ] ) , one obtains @xcite : @xmath61\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which decrease as @xmath12 increases .      in network",
    "glass - forming liquids , the fragility index appears to be also deeply related to structural properties .",
    "such a basic observation has been recently made and extensively documented by sidebottom @xcite . by considering a two - state model for the glass transition separating the intact bond state from a thermally excited broken bond state @xcite , a general variation of the configurational entropy with network connectivity can be proposed . in this model , the fragility index @xmath26",
    "is then determined solely by the entropy increase , which is associated with the occurence of new configurations that become accessible when bonds are broken under temperature increase . from bonds between atomic species",
    "@xcite , the construction can be generalized via a coarse - graining approach to bonds between local structures ( such as tetrahedral @xmath62 species in silicates @xcite ) or even bonds between intermediate range order ( iro ) structures that are found in borates @xcite .",
    "a generic behaviour of the index @xmath26 variation is obtained ( fig .",
    "[ sidebot ] ) which demonstrates a universal dependence of the glass forming fragility on the topological connectivity of the network . for the special case where intermediate range order is present",
    ", the coarse - graining procedure to a bond lattice indicates that the weakest links ( i.e. those which connect iro ) are the most relevant in determining the liquid fragility .",
    "building on a similar idea , large scale molecular dynamics simulations of network forming liquids @xcite show that aspects of topology and iro control the relaxation of the liquid . here",
    "the network topology is changed by varying the anion polarizability @xcite of the interaction potential , which governs the intertetrahedral bond angle , and , ultimately it is shown that the fragility is correlated to structural arrangements on different length scales .",
    "in particular , @xmath26 is found to increase with the number of edge - sharing ( es ) tetrahedral motifs in tetrahedral glass - forming liquids .",
    "for the special case of ge - x ( x = s , se ) systems however , the link between edge - sharing tetrahedra and fragility index does not follow such a correlation @xcite . a direct measurement of @xmath26 and the es fraction from raman spectroscopy indicates , indeed , that the trend in the fragility index is essentially governed by the underlying topology , and , in particular , by aspects of rigidity ( see below ) .",
    "an alternative viewpoint is proposed by luther - davies and others @xcite who emphasize the role played by chemical order , and especially by deviation from stoichiometry , rather than topology or rigidity . a joint spectroscopic and fragility experiment is , indeed , analyzed in terms of network dimensionality and stoichiometry change .",
    "it is suggested that fragility does not follow predictions from rigidity percolation ( in as - se ) but instead correlates with structural dimensionality , whereas for the ternary as - ge - se a minimum in fragility is claimed to be associated with a maximum in structural heterogeneity consisting of appropriate ratios of se - chains and gese@xmath13 tetrahedra .",
    "this claim is actually contradicted by the early work of angell and collaborators highlighting the connection between topology / rigidity and fragility index in the same chalcogenide liquid ( ge - as - se @xcite ) .",
    "the minimum in @xmath26 has been obtained at the network mean coordination number @xmath63=@xmath64r@xmath65=2.4 which is the location of the rigidity percolation threshold @xcite .",
    "the correlation with chemical order is also debated by boolchand and others who have emphasized the link between fragility minima and isostatic compositions @xcite , i.e. compositions that are close to the rigidity percolation threshold .",
    "this link between topology and fragility is also evidenced from the investigation of ionic diffusion and fragility on a series of iron - bearing alkali - alkaline earth silicate glasses @xcite .",
    "glass fragility is also found to display a relationship with atomic ordering on intermediate and extended ranges , a relationship that also connects to the notion of dynamic heterogeneities ( see below ) .",
    "specifically , the structure can be characterized in terms of topological and chemical ordering from neutron diffraction experiments in real ( pair correlation function @xmath66 ) and reciprocal space ( static structure factor @xmath67 ) @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the ordering for geo@xmath3 , sio@xmath3 and zncl@xmath3 at distances",
    "greater than the nearest neighbor lengthscale can be rationalized in terms of an interplay between the relative importance of two length scales @xcite .",
    "one of these is associated with an intermediate range that is directly accessed from the structure factor @xmath67 , the other lengthscale is associated with an extended range that is characterized from the decay of bhatia - thornton pair correlation functions in real space . with increasing glass fragility , i.e. when moving from geo@xmath3 to zncl@xmath3 , it has been found that the extended range ordering dominates @xcite .",
    "having such simple structural correlations in hand , it is not surprising that glassy relaxation has also been investigated by diffraction methods in order to follow low wavevector features with temperature , and , specifically , the first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) of the structure factor @xmath67 .",
    "it has been stated @xcite that fragile liquids usually do not have any structural signature of long range correlations so that the absence of a fsdp is indicative of a fragile glass - forming liquid .",
    "this correlation has been verified on a certain number of systems such as the very fragile zro@xmath3 and @xmath68o@xmath4 @xcite which do not exhibit a fsdp , in contrast with the less fragile zncl@xmath3 which shows a well - defined , but not sharp , fsdp @xcite , and with other examples of strong glass forming liquids such as germania and silica displaying a sharp fsdp @xcite .    by analyzing the typical features of the simulated structure factors with changing thermodynamic conditions ( density , composition ) ,",
    "bauchy and micoulaut @xcite have found that anomalies ( extrema ) in properties associated with glassy dynamics ( diffusivity d , activation energy @xmath24 which is proportional to fragility if @xmath12 does not vary too much ) are correlated with anomalies in structural features , as revealed by the change in fsdp ( peak position @xmath69 and width @xmath70 , fig .",
    "[ compar ] ) .",
    "the established correlation suggests that in strong glasses typical lengthscales of distance l=2@xmath71/k@xmath72 involved in the slower variation of viscosity with @xmath22 must lead to a grwith of the fsdp because the latter reflects some repetitive characteristic distance between structural units . also , the broadening of the fsdp is indicative of a correlation length ( scherrer equation @xcite ) defined by @xmath73=2@xmath71/@xmath74k@xmath72 that tends to maximize for strong glass - forming liquids ( fig .",
    "[ compar ] , bottom ) .",
    "network glass - forming fragilities display a certain number of other correlations with physical , chemical or rheological properties that have been reported in the literature .",
    "an inspection of fig .",
    "[ visc ] also indicates that supercooled liquids with a lower fragility index @xmath26 will lead to higher viscosities at a fixed @xmath75 .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that glass - forming tendency is increased for liquids that are able to increase their melt viscosity down to lower temperatures , i.e. for a given class of materials having a similar @xmath12 , glass - forming tendency is increased for melts with lower fragilities , this argument being particularly relevant for binary alloys .",
    "indeed , at eutectics where freezing - point depressions exist , glasses will form more easily because these depressions bring the liquid to lower temperatures and higher viscosities .",
    "such observations are furthermore found to correlate rather well when the composition of the eutectic is compared to compositions at which one has a minimum of the critical cooling rate that is needed in order to avoid crystallization @xcite .",
    "correlations have been suggested between fragility and nonexponentiality ( @xmath76 ) of the structural relaxation characterized by a kohlrausch exponent @xmath77 @xcite at low temperature and long times .",
    "these have been established @xcite from a combination of experimental techniques ( fig .",
    "[ fragility_beta ] ) . when all subgroups of glass formers are represented ( organic , polymers , networks )",
    "a clear relationship appears and indicates that the fragility index @xmath26 decreases with the exponent @xmath77 , i.e. as one moves towards the debye - type one - step relaxation limit ( @xmath77=1 ) , the fragility reaches its minimum value ( @xmath78  20 ) .",
    "a correlation of fragility to the non - ergodic level of the glass has been also found in the liquid phase as measured directly by dynamic light scattering @xcite .",
    "other authors have emphasized the central role played by elastic properties such as compressibility @xcite .",
    "novikov and sokolov @xcite have shown that the fragility of a glass - forming liquids is directly linked to the ratio of the instantaneous bulk and shear moduli , or the poisson s ratio .",
    "since the latter is related to the very local deformations of the cage structure made by neighbouring atoms , these authors argue that the poisson ratio should also control the non - ergodicity parameter which controls the fast dynamics of the liquid .",
    "however , this result has been challenged @xcite , and evidence has been brought that @xmath26 should rather scale with the ratio of the transverse and longitudinal sound velocity . building on a similar relationship , ruocco and co - workers @xcite have emphasized that the fragility should be linked with the elastic properties of the corresponding glass , quantified from the non - ergodicty parameter @xmath79 accessed from inelastic x - ray scattering ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fragility_beta ] ) .",
    "some other authors have also proposed an empirical relation between the fragility and the strength of fast dynamics which can be quantified from raman spectroscopy of corresponding glasses @xcite . according to this idea , the ratio of the relaxational to vibrational contributions around the boson peak has been proposed to relate to the fragility of the liquid . this relationship has been also challenged and",

    "however , when a focus is made only on the network - forming inorganic liquids which have typically @xmath7870 , the correlation becomes less obvious because of the reduced fragility index range .",
    "it would certainly be instructive to quantitatively test such correlations for the wide subclass of network glasses .",

    "the detail of the analysis @xcite also signals that during relaxation the viscoelastic deformation under stress can be decomposed into a sum of an elastic part , an inelastic ( or viscous ) part and a delayed elastic part , the latter being responsible for the non - linear primary creep stage observed during creep tests .",

    "an interesting perspective is provided by the comparison with the generic behavior of organic polymers @xcite since amorphous se is considered as a glassy polymer made of long chains that are progressively cross - linked by the addition of alloying elements .",

    "in such approaches , thermal equilibrium can not be reached , and ageing results from a downhill motion of an energy landscape that becomes increasingly flat .",
    "one major result of such approaches is that the time - translational invariance typical of ergodic systems is broken so that time correlators for any observable must be defined in the ageing rgime , and these now depend explicitely on both times @xmath353 and @xmath435 , as do the response functions of the system .",

    "indeed , glass elasticity and the presence of soft elastic modes have been found to drive many aspects of glassy relaxation as mentioned throughout this review , and also to relate to thermodynamic changes across the glass transition .",
    "in fact , an abundance of such soft modes permits exploration of the phase space without large changes in energy @xcite , and this ultimately leads to small changes in the specific heat .",
    "this , of course , connects back to the notion of floppy modes @xcite that are present in weakly connected ( flexible ) network glasses .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to consider in a combined fashion aspects from the statistical mechanics of off - equilibrium systems @xcite , molecular simulations and rigidity theory to investigate the ageing of chalcogenide glasses , and this would allow to describe these phenomena beyond the qualitative level ( fig .",
    "[ ageing_ip ] ) . given the number of important applications of chalcogenides in optoelectronics @xcite , the understanding and ,",
    "eventually , the control of aging phenomena could improve the stability of devices using chalcogides as base material , as recently stressed in a study on optical phase change recording @xcite .",
    "still , a certain number of challenges remain that are inherent to some of the methods employed : small system sizes due to _ ab initio _ simulations in order to treat correctly the covalent or semi - metallic bonding , and the short timescale of the md simulations . despite these limitations , such methods exhibit a certain number of promising results on this topic for the archetypal sio@xmath3 @xcite , and",
    "might well be applied in a similar fashion to its parent chalcogenide system with a wealth of possible applications , directly derived from the very basic features of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",

    "<S> recent progresses in the description of glassy relaxation and ageing are reviewed for the wide class of network - forming materials such as @xmath0 , ge@xmath1se@xmath2 , silicates ( sio@xmath3-na@xmath3o ) or borates ( b@xmath3o@xmath4-li@xmath3o ) , all of them having an important usefulness in domestic , geological or optoelectronic applications . </S>",
    "<S> a brief introduction of the glass transition phenomenology is given , together with the salient features that are revealed both from theory and experiments . </S>",
    "<S> standard experimental methods used for the characterization of the slowing down of the dynamics are reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss the important role played by aspect of network topology and rigidity for the understanding of the relaxation of the glass transition , while also permitting analytical predictions of glass properties from simple and insightful models based on the network structure . </S>",
    "<S> we also emphasize the great utility of computer simulations which probe the dynamics at the molecular level , and permit to calculate various structure - related functions in connection with glassy relaxation and the physics of ageing which reveals the off - equilibrium nature of glasses . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the notion of spatial variations of structure which leads to the picture of `` _ dynamic heterogeneities _ '' , and recent results of this important topic for network glasses are also reviewed . </S>"
