    "despite their proximity , the properties of mw dwarf galaxies are far from being unanimously interpreted .",
    "they are often considered as remnants of primordial galaxies that would have escaped to the numerous merger events expected in the hierarchical scenario . within the @xmath0cdm paradigm",
    "they are believed to be dark matter dominated sub haloes that are gravitationally trapped in the mw halo and have not yet merged completely with their host @xcite . as the @xmath0cdm predicted a considerable number of massive sub - haloes relatively to the small number of observed dwarf galaxies surrounding the mw and other giant spirals , this leads to objects considerably dominated by their dark matter content .",
    "such objects , including ufds , are currently followed to search for dark matter annihilation , without any positive detection yet ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however some dwarf galaxies may be tidally formed during the numerous merger events expected in the frame of the @xmath0cdm scenario @xcite , leading to objects mainly free of dark matter .",
    "@xcite claimed that most dwarf galaxies could be of tidal origin , although this is disputed by @xcite and by @xcite . a full description of the number density of tdgs is still lacking , as it has to account for gas - rich mergers that likely occurred in the past , as well as to consider a representative sampling of ( major ) merger orbital parameters and to describe the production and destruction rate with time of tdgs within evolving tidal tails .",
    "a significant part of our knowledge of dwarf galaxy properties is based on the local group content , including irregular dwarf galaxies ( dirr ) with the two magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , spheroidal dwarf galaxies ( dsph ) , and ultrafaintdwarf galaxies ( ufd ) , which have been recently discovered @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that dsphs lie close to the mw ( mean distance 193 kpc ) , whereas the dirr are more distant ( 572 kpc ) , except the mcs . in order to explain this distance - dependent morphological bias",
    ", @xcite suggested that the closest dwarf galaxies undergo physical phenomenons that changed their morphology from dirr to dsph , such as stripping , stirring or tidal force .",
    "@xcite have re - estimated the proper motion of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) to a significantly larger value than previous estimates , i.e. a velocity of 378 km / s relatively to the mw .",
    "thus either mcs are passing for the first time close to the mw @xcite or one needs to assume a quite large dark matter content for the mw with @xmath1= 2.7 @xmath2 0.5 @xmath3 @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 @xcite , i.e. a value 50 times larger than its baryonic content and even larger to that of m31 .",
    "a recent measurement of the leoii proper motion @xcite provides a similar constraint , letting open the question of whether some of the mw dwarf galaxies may be unbound , and as such , would not be mw satellites .",
    "in addition , most of the mw dwarf galaxies seems to belong to a plan - like structure , the plane of satellite ( vpos ) which is found to be roughly perpendicular to the mw disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite updated this idea by using the 11 classical dwarf galaxies and compared the satellite spatial distribution with the isotropic spatial distribution expected from @xmath0cdm simulations .",
    "they concluded that the dwarf galaxy distribution can not derive from the expected @xmath0cdm distribution , and @xcite deduced that their spatial distribution is neither spherical nor mildly prolate with a confidence of more than 99% .",
    "moreover , the vpos could be a somewhat permanent structure as the angular momenta of five dsphs plus the mcs indicate a coherent motion within the vpos @xcite .",
    "@xcite summarized the different possible concepts to explain the concordance between the spatial and angular momentum distribution of the vpos galaxies .",
    "they investigated the scenario of a dwarf galaxy group surrounding the mcs @xcite , possibly coming from a filament @xcite , which would be entering the mw halo in ordered motions .",
    "none of these explanations seem fully satisfactory , because it requires a quite unexpected compact group as a progenitor , and because the super galactic plane is almost perpendicular to the vpos @xcite .    a fully different alternative would be that mw dwarf galaxies originate from an ancient tidal tail ( see a detailed discussion on the possible tidal origin in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would explain their ordered motion .",
    "in fact such an alternative was suggested quite early @xcite and @xcite have recently investigated the possibility of a major merger or a fly - by interaction ( mass ratio 1:1 or 4:1 ) that would have occurred in the early history of the mw , producing tidal tails and then tdgs . assuming an orbital angular momentum aligned to the vpos , the tidal tail associated to this early interaction in the mw history would have formed tdgs that could further populate the vpos . while this is an interesting suggestion ,",
    "perhaps the mw is not the best candidate for being a merger remnant , which are generally associated with classical bulge galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , as mentioned by @xcite , the fly - by alternative would have let the interloper well detectable , at the fringes of the local group .",
    "all the above ideas are very imaginative and they may resolve the origin of the vpos and why dwarf galaxies are part of it .",
    "however this is at the cost of introducing another ad - hoc assumption .",
    "alternatively , we may consider the past history of the mw in the whole context of the local group , in which the baryonic content is dominated by m31 .",
    "quoting @xcite :  both the high metallicity of the m31 halo , and the @xmath6 luminosity profile of the andromeda galaxy , suggest that this object might have formed from the early merger and subsequent violent relaxation , of two ( or more ) relatively massive metal - rich ancestral objects \" . as further noticed by @xcite , the disk plane of m31",
    "is seen almost perpendicular , implying that tidal tails possibly formed after a gas - rich merger in the m31 history could be part of a hyper - plane that includes the mw .",
    "by tracing back in time the position of the lmc , @xcite have shown that the lmc could be near m31 , 5 to 8 gyr ago .",
    "moreover , @xcite have proposed that m31 could be the result of a major , gas - rich merger because it provides a simple and common interpretation of most of its exceptional properties , including the giant stream , the outer thick disk , as well as the giant ring .",
    "constraints from stellar population ages in these different halo substructures imply a first close passage 8 to 9 gyr ago and a fusion time 5.5 to 6 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "this paper intends to verify whether or not the ordered motion of the mw dwarf galaxies could be entirely due to their origin as tdgs formed from a tidal tail caused by an ancient interaction in the history of m31 .",
    "the goal is to verify whether this alternative may explain two exceptional features in the local group : the vpos and the mw - lmc - smc proximity .",
    "@xcite estimate the occurrence of the mw - lmc - smc configuration for 414 mw - like galaxies in a local volume of @xmath7 mpc@xmath8 ( 0.01 @xmath9 z @xmath9 0.055 ) .",
    "the chance to found out a galaxy having two close companions at least as massive than the smc within a projected separation of 70 kpc and a radial separation of 400 km.s@xmath10 is only 0.4@xmath11% ( 2 examples ) .",
    "moreover , in each of these configurations there is another @xmath12 luminosity galaxy within 1 mpc from the mw - like galaxy .",
    "this may support the importance of m31 for the mcs formation , and then , accounting for the vpos , for all the mw dwarves .    in sect .",
    "2 , we present the vpos properties and refine its statistical significance by including with additional constraints on the dwarf angular momenta . in sect .",
    "3 , we describe both the physical and numerical models that we adopt for reproducing the vpos . in sect .",
    "4 , we try to reproduce the vpos with a simple tidal tail toy model . then in sect .",
    "5 , the model is improved to closely match the work made by @xcite , providing more realistic initial conditions for the tidal tail . sect . 6 summarizes the observational coincidences that support the m31 scenario , discusses the possible falsifications , and describes the required further studies for testing them .    in this paper",
    ", we use two coordinate systems .",
    "one is the galactocentric coordinate which is centered on the mw @xcite .",
    "this system is used in sect . 2 and sect .",
    "4 . in sect . 5",
    ", we use a `` projection '' coordinate which is centered on the current m31 position with the @xmath13-axis pointing from m31 to the sun , the @xmath14- and @xmath15-axis parallel to the east and the north of celestial coordinate at m31 position . in this projection coordinate , mw is located at ( x , y , z ) = ( 6.42 , -2.72 , 788.85 ) kpc and the sun at ( 0 , 0 , 785 ) kpc , assuming that the distance of m31 is 785 kpc .",
    "the distances between the dwarf galaxies and the mw can be used as a simple criterion to verify whether dwarf galaxies are mw companions . the gravitational force of the galaxy becomes weaker for distances larger than the virial radius , which ranges from 150 to 300 kpc .",
    "following @xcite , we consider as companions only the galaxies in a sphere with a radius of 300 kpc ( see fig . [",
    "fig : hist_dist ] ) . with this simple criterion ,",
    "all the dirr but the mcs are discarded , while most of the dsph and ufds are taken into account .",
    "the next goal is to get a complete sample of dwarf galaxies within this sphere with a cut in absolute v - band magnitude .",
    "two factors make this task difficult : the 11 classical dwarf galaxies were discovered by different sets of observations , and the zone of avoidance hides a part of the sky .",
    "thus in principle , our sample may be affected by strong observational biases .",
    "the fact that the newly discovered satellites by the sdss are systematically fainter than the classical dwarf galaxies is however reassuring .",
    "even canes vanetaci i with a @xmath16= -7.5 @xmath2 0.5 @xcite is fainter than the faintest classical dwarf , suggesting that no classical dwarf could have been missed in the sky not sampled by the sdss ( 80% of the sky , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , except maybe in the zone of avoidance .",
    "accounting for the ufds found by the sdss that includes a significant part of the vpos could therefore bias the resulting statistics .",
    "thus , we will consider only the 11 classical dwarf galaxies grouped in a sample named `` dsphmc '' : lmc , smc , sagittarius , fornax , leo i , leo ii , sculptor , sextans , carina , draco , ursa minor , following @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "at first sight , a possible causal link between a possible merger in the history of m31 and the mw dwarf galaxies might appear at odds with many years of studies of the local group . to our knowledge",
    "such a proposition has never been made , probably because it appears far too unlikely for geometrical reasons : why the mw would be precisely at a _ rendez vous _ with a tidal tail formed during the first passage , 8 to 9 gyr ago , of a merger that occurred at more than 780 kpc away ?",
    "let us consider three galaxies of similar masses , two of them being involved in a merger process .",
    "what is the chance that a tidal tail produced during the event reaches the third galaxy ? assuming a merger in the history of m31 , it should be rather small given the fraction of the volume swept by a tidal tail . the corresponding conic volume is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cone ] , drawing a solid angle of 2000 square degrees , i.e , 5.5% of the 4@xmath25 steradian sphere . in principle",
    "this argument should suffice to falsify or reject a possibility to associate m31 to the mw dwarf galaxies . in practice",
    ", the mw lies precisely within this small volume , because both the m31 disk is seen edge - on and the geometry of the giant stream ( and of the northern loop ) fixes the progenitors inclinations , and then the properties of the tidal tail induced after the first passage .",
    "we have considered a very large number of models from @xcite as well as more recent ones . in these models",
    ", @xmath26 ranges from 24 to 30 kpc , the mass ratio from 2.5 to 3.5 , the dark to baryonic matter ratio from 10 to 25% , and a significant range of initial progenitor inclinations are explored , which result in an uncertainty on the angular location of the first tidal tail that is smaller than 20 degrees .",
    "of course we can not claim having investigated all the numerous parameters of a merger model for m31 , although the number of constraints just describing the m31 galaxy and its outskirts are quite impressive @xcite .",
    "we have also verified that for all geometrical configurations studied by @xcite , the disk plane is close within less than 25 degrees to the orbital plane .",
    "this favorable configuration applies well to the m31 disk ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cone ] ) , which is supported by an angular momentum that is found to be slightly larger than the average of similar local spiral galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps all of the above is just a coincidence and other properties would easily falsify a causal link between the m31 merger and the mw dwarf galaxies .",
    "[ fig : tt_ic ] shows that the tidal tail velocity matches well that of the lmc , in amplitude and orientation .",
    "this is ensured using the most recent results compiled by @xcite with quite large uncertainties ( see their fig .",
    "10 ) , while the amplitude of the lmc velocity would be too large using the @xcite values .",
    "such a match with the lmc velocity is another intriguing coincidence . while @xcite have shown that the lmc past trajectory may have passed near m31 for a precise range of m31 transverse velocity , why would the velocity of the modeled tidal tail follow such an amplitude and orientation ?",
    "this coincidence naturally ensures that our model can reproduce the vpos orientation and dwarf angular momenta ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_simu ] ) .    possibly the most astonishing , fully unexpected coincidence is the fact that the part of the tidal tail shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tt_simu ] which interacts with the mw is very close to the most massive simulated tidal dwarf , tdg2 , whose mass almost reaches that of the lmc .",
    "this is very encouraging for pursuing this study with higher resolution simulations .",
    "first we acknowledge that a robust proof of a dominant dark matter component in mw dwarf galaxies would provide a definitive falsification of the scenario proposed in this paper .",
    "it may come from the detection of dark matter annihilation in mw dwarf galaxies .",
    "in fact the non - detection of dark matter annihilation in mw dwarf galaxies could provide the strongest up to date constraint on the nature of the dark matter particles , excluding for some annihilation channels , thermal dark matter for masses below 30 gev or so ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , a tidal origin for the mw dwarf galaxies would discard a significant dark matter content in these galaxies .",
    "it was considered very early ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and was revived by @xcite . supports for this assumption are numerous and well summarised by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their old stellar population are perhaps inherited from the merger progenitors .",
    "their long lifetime in the tidal tail could have let them in various environments providing a diversity in star formation histories that could explain their different behaviours .",
    "@xcite summarised that `` the physics of tdg formation and evolution is sufficiently well understood to conclude that 1 ) once formed at a sufficient distance from the host , tdgs will take an extremely long time to dissolve , if at all ; and 2 ) the tdgs formed will naturally lead to a population of ancient tdgs that resemble dsph satellites '' .",
    "however to be plausible our scenario ( as well as that of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) requires an alternative explanation of the large mass - to - light ratios of the mw dwarf galaxies .",
    "recently @xcite have simulated dark - matter free satellites that after several orbits around the mw are out - of - equilibrium bodies with high apparent mass - to - light ratios . according to their claim ,",
    "if such progenitors of mw satellites have reached the mw potential at the same time along a few specific orbits , they may reproduce most of their intrinsic kinematics and surface brightness .",
    "although similar simulations are beyond the scope of this paper , we noticed that the @xcite progenitors are far more compact than the tdgs that are formed from our modelling .",
    "in other words , it is likely that realistic tdgs are more fragile and they may be even more easily disrupted than in the @xcite study . in a forthcoming paper we will study a more realistic tdg infalling into the mw potential and to verify whether or not such an event may reproduce the mw dwarf galaxies . such a study is mandatory to verify whether or not the large mass - to - light ratios of the mw dwarf galaxies falsify the m31 scenario .",
    "the above mentioned studies do not apply to the magellanic clouds and one may wonder whether or not the most massive irr galaxies of the local group could also be tdgs . in the m31 scenario , both lmc and smc have arrived for the first time in the mw halo , and as such they are not stripped of their gas , conversely to other mw dwarf galaxies .",
    "the stellar mass of the lmc has been properly estimated by @xcite assuming an lmc v - band absolute magnitude of @xmath27 , an extinction of @xmath28=0.4 , and an extinction - corrected color @xmath29 .",
    "following @xcite , the stellar mass for the lmc is estimated to be @xmath30 for a diet salpeter imf .",
    "based on a full reconstruction of the star formation history , @xcite found a stellar mass ranging from 1.7 to 3.5@xmath31 ( see their fig .",
    "12 ) for a salpeter imf . to be compared with a diet salpeter imf value , one has to subtract 0.15 dex @xcite to these values , reaching a range of 1.2 to 2.5 @xmath32 .",
    "other imfs generally provides a lower stellar mass , by subtracting an additional 0.15 dex for e.g. a @xcite or a @xcite imf . according to @xcite , the lmc gas mass is @xmath33 and thus the baryonic mass ranges from 1.7 to 3.1 @xmath32 , assuming a diet salpeter imf for the stellar mass estimate .",
    "these values are larger than those of table [ tab : tdgs ] by a factor 2 to 3 , which could be a serious difficulty for a tidal origin of the lmc .",
    "more detailed and resolved simulations of gas - rich tidal tail with more realistic physical conditions may help to further investigate this issue . on the observational side",
    ", @xcite found several tdgs ( approximately 15% of them ) with a mass larger than 10@xmath34 m@xmath35 , after a wide tdg search in the sdss data through the galaxy zoo project .",
    "the fact that these local mergers are certainly less gas - rich than the assumed ancient m31 merger progenitors suggests the latter may lead to tdgs as massive as the lmc .    to investigate whether a tidal origin related to a merger at the m31 location is realistic or not would require to compare it with the numerous results provided by studies on the local group and dwarf galaxies .",
    "it also requires to firmly assess the model properties and its predictions before any conclusion .",
    "for example the recent determination of the fe / h abundance of old stars in the lmc may be not a falsification of this scenario ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the fact that the old globular clusters in m31 are relatively fe / h richer can be explained by our model .",
    "the lmc is predicted to be formed within the first passage tidal tail with stars stripped from the less massive interloper 8 to 9 gyr ago , while old globular clusters could have been formed from material stripped from the most massive interloper , i.e. , expected to be metal richer .",
    "the search for further falsification tests has to continue .",
    "it is unclear yet whether all classical dwarf galaxies are part of the vpos .",
    "sagittarius is clearly off the vpos in fig .",
    "[ fig : am_obs ] .",
    "could it be due to the fact that it is strongly tidally disrupted by the mw potential ?",
    "figure [ fig : fig_vr ] provides a crucial test of the m31 scenario by comparing the dwarf velocities to the escape velocities assuming two values for the mw mass .",
    "however this exercise is limited by the accuracy of the proper motion data : this excludes draco , sextans and leoii for which the uncertainties are so large that their bound or unbound nature remains unknown .",
    "for example , the sextans proper motion was not measured but derived , and the draco proper motion was calculated by a ground - based telescope more than 10 years ago providing an extremely high value , @xmath36 = 556 km / s .",
    "it results that sag , umi and carina are certainly bound for any values of the mw mass , while all other dwarf galaxies are lying in a region where the measurement accuracy does not allow us to conclude .",
    "perhaps the sag , umi and carina properties are not consistent with the m31 merger scenario , and only much more accurate measurements of proper motion will allow to provide a similar test for the other dwarf galaxies .",
    "using proper motions to distinguish between the various scenarios for the formation of the dwarf galaxies is very tempting but often limited by the data accuracy ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by the poor knowledge about the true mw total mass .",
    "moreover this also depends on the nature of their progenitors .",
    "if assumed to be of tidal origin from a gas - rich merger , they should be gas - rich as shown in table [ tab : tdgs ] prior they interact with the mw potential .",
    "10@xmath37 m@xmath38 in both cases .",
    "the red lines represent the uncertainty associated with the velocities of the classical dwarf galaxies . ]",
    "possibly , when entering the mw potential , these gas - rich tdgs are entirely stripped of their gas through tidal shocks and ram pressure stripping as described by @xcite .",
    "more recently , many authors ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have shown that tidal stirring is an efficient mechanism to remove the gas from gas - rich , dark matter dominated , dwarf irregular galaxies interacting with the potential of a massive galaxy such as the mw .",
    "this leads to their transformation into dwarf spheroidals , which turns rotationally supported stellar systems into pressure supported ones .",
    "the interplay between dynamical friction and tidal mass evaporation not only decreases strongly their mass by factors reaching 10 , it affects also their angular momentum and velocity as shown by @xcite .",
    "this might lead to a @xmath39 20% decay in velocity during 2 gyr ( see their fig .",
    "6 ) , e.g. , providing initial velocities of umi and carina consistent with those of other dwarf galaxies .",
    "our initial guess is that tidal stirring should be more efficient for progenitors that are not dark matter dominated such as tdgs .",
    "these are however pure conjectures that underlines the severe limitations of our modeling for which we have represented tidal tail particles as point masses . for reaching a conclusive answer about the consistency of the m31 merger scenario with the dwarf properties would require a far more complete modeling , perhaps taking into account",
    "the interaction between the whole tidal tail and its associated tdgs with the mw potential . up to our knowledge",
    ", such a simulation have never been done by assuming a dark - matter free irregular galaxy such as a realistic tdg falling in the potential of a massive galaxy .",
    "we are encouraged to perform this in a future study also because we notice that the most inconsistent galaxy velocities ( those of sag , umi and carina ) have also the angular momenta the most shifted from the averaged dwarf galaxy angular momentum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : am_obs ] ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that the classical bulge of m31 is due to an ancient major merger @xcite . quoting john kormendy ( 2010 , private communication ) : `` do nt we already know with some confidence that m31 was formed in at least one ( in fact : very probably exactly one ) major merger ? ''",
    "perhaps its consequences have not been fully investigated , whereas it occurred in the galaxy that represents almost two third of the local group baryonic mass .",
    "the immediate question is : where are the relics of the most energetic event that occurred in the whole local group history ?",
    "one may investigate the most anomalous and difficult to explain features discovered in the local group . among them are the m31 haunted halo @xcite , the giant stream @xcite , the vpos and also the unusual proximity of two massive irr near the mw ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "having m31 involved in a merger at these epochs may be quite common , as demonstrated by detailed studies of intermediate redshift galaxies from the images sample @xcite .",
    "this model is quite challenging in reproducing many other properties of the m31 galaxy ( disk , bulge , thick disk and 10 kpc ring ) together with the giant stream .",

    "here we have concentrated our efforts to examine the largest tidal tail , which is formed during the first passage , stripping the minor encounter stars , 8 to 9 gyr ago .",
    "this tidal tail is bringing the largest amount of baryonic material expelled by this event towards the local group .",
    "it results in a series of `` coincidences '' that considerably strengthens our preliminary conjecture .",
    "the mw is found precisely at the meeting point with the tidal tail , at present time .",
    "moreover , the velocity of the tidal tail matches well that of the lmc providing a good fit of the vpos , including its spatial orientation and the angular momentum , even to some details such as the inverted angular momentum of sculptor .    having this in mind",
    "we conclude that a link between the vpos and the major merger at the m31 location is plausible .",
    "compared to the mw merger or encounter hypothesis of @xcite , it has the advantage of resulting from a testable prediction that could be falsified or supported by many observations of the local group .",
    "besides this , the present modeling is made within the @xmath0cdm scenario and there is no peculiar need to account for other physics to describe the above noticed unusual properties of the local group , i.e. the vpos , the presence of two massive irr near the mw and most features found in the m31 halo .",
    "in fact , @xcite have been the first to show that within @xmath0cdm , there should be renegade sub - halo , i.e. sub - halo of m31 that could have migrated towards the mw .",
    "however they could not explain neither the vpos nor the lmc and its large velocity , conversely to our prediction that lead to an external origin for most mw dwarf galaxies .",
    "if the latter is true , it strengthens the tension between the predicted number of dark matter sub - haloes and observations , i.e. the so - called missing satellite problem , which might be then reconsidered as an excess of sub - haloes in the @xmath0cdm paradigm .    note added into proofs",
    ": @xcite recently shows that filamentary infall is excluded to explain the vpos .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "we are grateful to jianling wang for generating a part of the models of m31 that have been used in this study .",
    "finally , to represent the local group in 3d , three - dimensional visualization was conducted with the s2plot programming library .",
    "we warmly thanks the referee whose remarks have significantly improved the manuscript including by identifying the important tests that should be made to put the m31 scenario in a cosmological context .",
    "the statistical test proposed by @xcite assesses whether the mw dwarf galaxy positions or velocities derive from an isotropic distribution .",
    "50 000 random samples are generated using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "each sample is isotropic and follows a radial density distribution @xmath42 , consistent with the radial distribution of the mw dwarf galaxy positions @xcite and velocities .",
    "a plane is fitted for each sample , and the associated uncertainty is estimated using bootstrap resampling as follows .",
    "each sample is resampled 1  000 times and the perpendicular vector for each of the corresponding fitted plane is stored in a matrix m. the 3d symmetric matrix @xmath43 is computed and its three eigen values ( @xmath44 ) calculated . to characterize the 1 000 vector distribution ,",
    "i.e. , to characterize the plane fit uncertainty , two numbers are defined using the eigen values : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 describes how clustered the vector distribution is , while @xmath48 indicates how the vector distribution focuses towards one direction .",
    "if @xmath47 and @xmath48 are small ( @xmath49 ) the vector distribution is close to isotropic ( the plane fit uncertainty is thus large ) , whereas if @xmath47 and @xmath48 are large ( @xmath50 ) the vector distribution clearly defines one direction ( the plane fit is then well defined ) .",
    "the resulting statistics of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : am_obs ] . for the 10 classical dwarf galaxy position and velocity set ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are also derived .",
    "the distribution function d(@xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , defined by the probability that @xmath53 and @xmath54 , can be used to estimate the probability for a sample to derive from an isotropic law .",

    "<S> the local group is often seen to be a quiescent environment without significant merger events . </S>",
    "<S> however an ancient major merger may have occurred in the most massive galaxy as suggested by the m31 classical bulge and its halo haunted by numerous stellar streams . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations have shown that tidal tails formed during gas - rich major mergers are long - lived and could be responsible for old stellar streams and likely induce the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) . using several hydrodynamical simulations we have investigated the most prominent tidal tail formed during the first passage , which is gas - rich and contains old and metal poor stars . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered several striking coincidences after comparing its location and motion to those of the milky way ( mw ) and of the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , the tidal tail is sweeping a relatively small volume in which the mw precisely lies . because the geometry of the merger is somehow fixed by the anisotropic properties of the giant stream ( gs ) , we evaluate the chance of the mw to be at such a _ rendez - vous _ with this gigantic tidal tail to be 5% . </S>",
    "<S> second , the velocity of the tidal tail matches the lmc proper motion , and reproduce quite well the geometrical and angular momentum properties of the mw dwarfs , i.e. the so - called disk of satellites , better called vast polar structure ( vpos ) . </S>",
    "<S> third , the simulation of the tidal tail reveals one of the formed tdg with mass and location almost comparable to those of the lmc . </S>",
    "<S> our present modeling is however too limited to study the detailed interaction of gas - rich tdgs with the potential of the mw , and a complementary study is required to test whether the dwarf intrinsic properties can be accounted for by our scenario . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless this study suggests a causal link between an expected event , an ancient , gas - rich major merger at the m31 location , and several enigma in the local group , namely the gs in the m31 outskirts , the vpos almost perpendicular to the mw disk , and the presence of the mcs , two irr galaxies near the mw .    </S>",
