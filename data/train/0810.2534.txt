    "internal , slow ( secular ) evolution of galaxy disks occurs when nonaxisymmetries such as bars and spiral structure redistribute energy and angular momentum and rearrange disk structure .",
    "environmentally driven evolution can also be secular ( e.g. , galaxy harassment ) , although better known processes are rapid we concentrate on one consequence of environmental secular evolution .",
    "it is one of several processes that can transform late - type dwarfs into `` spheroidals '' , i.e. , galaxies that are morphologically similar to ellipticals but that have different structural parameter correlations indicative of different formation physics .",

    "this paper concentrates on new observations of pseudobulge properties .    whatever the engine , internal evolution has similar consequences . like all self - gravitating systems ,",
    "galaxy disks tend to spread  the outsides expand and the insides contract ( tremaine 1989 ) .",
    "this is as fundamental to disk evolution as core collapse is to globular clusters , as the production of hot jupiters and colder neptunes is to the evolution of planetary systems , and as evolution to red giants containing proto - white - dwarfs is to stellar evolution ( kormendy & fisher 2005 ; kormendy 2008 ) . in galaxy disks , gas infall and star formation builds dense central components that get mistaken for bulges but that were not made by galaxy mergers .",
    "they come in several varieties depending on what drives the evolution .",
    "pseudobulges made from disk gas are often but not always disky ( kormendy 1993 ; kk04 ; fisher & drory 2008a ) .",

    "`` pseudobulges ''  for all central , high - density products of disk secular evolution .    how to identify pseudobulges is discussed in kk04 .",
    "prototypical examples that are more disky than classical bulges were first recognized by their rapid rotation ( figure 2 ) .",
    "disks have large @xmath4 and plot above the oblate line when seen at inclinations other than edge - on",
    ". early identification of very disky ( e.g. , ngc  4736 , ngc 3945 ) and moderately disky ( e.g. , ngc 2950 , also a nuclear bar ) pseudobulges have recently been augmented as shown in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2 is an approximate analysis based on long - slit , major - axis spectra .",
    "integral - field spectroscopy from the sauron team now provides beautifully detailed detections of rapidly rotating , disky pseudobulges .",
    "often ( figure 3 ) , it is exactly the high - surface - brightness center  where the projected brightness profile rises above the inward extrapolation of the outer disk profile  that shows rapid rotation and a corresponding inward decrease in velocity dispersion .",
    "many of these kinematically decoupled components are also younger than the rest of the inner galaxy . some counter - rotate ( mcdermid et al .  2006 ) and presumably are made from accreted material .",

    "classical and pseudo bulges can coexist ( kk04 ; kormendy et al .  2006 ; erwin 2007 ) , but the morphology in figure 4 is not due to nuclear disks embedded in classical bulges that are hidden by the display parameters .",
    "bulges have steep brightness profiles , so bulge light would dilute the contrast in the spiral structure very strongly at smaller radii .",
    "but the strength of the spiral structure depends little on radius :  essentially all of the pseudobulge participates .",
    "the imaging survey authors generally interpret disky bulges as consequences of secular evolution .",

    "we know of no sc or later - type galaxy with a classical bulge ( kk04 ) .",
    "so the solution to the above problem is not to hope that bulgeless disks are rare enough that they can be explained as the tail of a distribution of formation histories that included a few fortuitously mergerless galaxies .",
