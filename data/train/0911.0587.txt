    "the development of robust methods for the computation of nonequilibrium properties of quantum many - particle systems is a crucial issue in present - day condensed matter physics , with impact on topics ranging from nonequilibrium transport in nanostructures@xcite to pump - probe spectroscopy of bulk condensed matter systems@xcite and the wide range of new spectroscopies possible in cold atom systems.@xcite an important step forward occurred with the development of continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) methods for impurity models .",
    "these algorithms were first introduced as imaginary - time methods for obtaining equilibrium properties @xcite and soon afterwards were extended to real - time dynamics and nonequilibrium problems.@xcite    the continuous - time methods are in essence stochastic samplings of diagrammatic expansions of the time evolution operator .",
    "the mean perturbation order required in the calculation increases with the time ( or inverse temperature ) to be studied and the calculations are limited by the perturbation order which can be achieved with given computational resources . in the equilibrium case one",
    "considers the imaginary - time evolution operator @xmath4 $ ] which is real and positive definite , so the computational task is to estimate a sum of real ( decaying ) exponentials and the only sign problem which arises is the fermion sign problem occurring in models complicated enough to sustain fermion loops . for these reasons",
    "the ctqmc methods have proven to be very powerful in the equilibrium context.@xcite in the real time case , on the other hand , one must consider the intrinsically complex time evolution operator @xmath5 $ ] , and convergence comes from the cancellation of oscillations .",
    "the theoretical task is therefore to estimate the sum of terms with oscillating signs or rotating phases and a severe  dynamical \" sign problem occurs even in the absence of fermion loops .",
    "the average sign decreases exponentially with perturbation order , which limits the accessible range of interaction strengths and simulation times .    because of these limitations , important questions such as the nonequilibrium kondo effect",
    "could so far not be adequately addressed .",
    "the equilibrium kondo effect in quantum dots,@xcite which involves the formation of a scattering resonance ( density of states peak ) at the fermi level , was experimentally confirmed in the zero bias limit.@xcite while at very low voltage biasses , the pinning of the kondo resonance to the fermi level leads to an unrenormalized conductance for symmetric dots , it is well known that a high voltage bias destroys the kondo effect .",
    "the crossover from the low voltage universal regime (  linear response regime \" ) to the higher bias coulomb blockade regime is presently not understood .",
    "it has been proposed on the basis of the noncrossing approximation,@xcite real time diagrammatic methods,@xcite and perturbative calculations@xcite that the peak in the density of states splits into two in a certain parameter regime .",
    "our previous investigation of the non - equilibrium anderson model @xcite produced no sign of this phenomenon , but the accuracy of the simulations in the low - bias region was not sufficient to settle the issue .",
    "methodological improvements allowing a more accurate numerical study of the small - to - intermediate voltage regime are therefore needed .",
    "the existing continuous - time quantum monte carlo approaches for nonequilibrium systems are more - or - less direct extensions of the imaginary time algorithms previously developed .",
    "it appears worthwhile to attempt to optimize them , even though the dynamical sign problem inherent in these methods unavoidably limits what can be achieved . in this paper",
    "we present an efficient implementation of the weak - coupling diagrammatic monte carlo method for non - equilibrium systems , describing ways to reorganize the expansion and to improve the measurement formulae in order to increase the accuracy of the numerical data for a given set of parameters .",
    "the method introduced previously@xcite corresponds to the simulation of a system prepared in the nonequilibrium but non - interacting state , with the interaction turned on at time @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to this simulation method as an  interaction quench \" .",
    "since the real - time methods compute the time evolution of the system after the quench , an important consideration is the time needed for the system to evolve to the interacting steady state .",
    "optimized preparation of the initial ensemble has the potential to reduce this relaxation time , therefore leading to simulations requiring a smaller total time interval for the measurement of a given property .",
    "motivated by this idea we extend the formalism from two real - time branches to an ",
    "l - shaped \" contour which includes an imaginary time branch .",
    "evolution along the imaginary time branch may be thought of as preparing the system in a correlated equilibrium state , after which the voltage is turned on at time @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to this simulation method as a  voltage quench \" .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to compare interaction and voltage quenches .",
    "we will show that at temperature @xmath7 interaction quenches are suitable for voltage biasses larger than the kondo temperature ( i.  e. for voltage biasses large enough to suppress the kondo resonance in the many - body density of states ) .",
    "the times which can be reached in the monte carlo simulation are long enough to observe convergence into a steady state even at large interaction strengths . on the other hand ,",
    "if the voltage bias is small and the temperature is finite , the voltage quench is a suitable alternative , because it allows the important ground state correlations to be built up via the computationally less problematic imaginary time evolution .",
    "we show that our optimized implementation allows the computation of accurate currents over a wide voltage range , even for interaction strengths which are clearly outside the reach of low - order perturbation theory .",
    "we use the numerical results to test predictions based on fourth order perturbation theory in the self - energy.@xcite we determine the largest interaction strength for which the perturbation theory provides accurate results over the entire voltage range , and for larger interactions , the voltage window where deviations appear . the predicted splitting of the kondo resonance @xcite",
    "is not evident in the numerical data .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we introduce the model to be solved and present the methods used to solve it , in particular defining the voltage and interaction quenches .",

    "as we shall see in section [ voltagequench ] a sharp high frequency cutoff leads to oscillations in the time evolution of the current after a voltage quench .",

    "the interaction and the chemical potentials need not be the same on the imaginary time branch as they are on the real - time branches . in the formalism as written the interaction and chemical potentials are taken to be time independent on the real - time branches , but it is straightforward to generalize the method to time - dependent @xmath0 and @xmath42 .",
    "the notation @xmath43 indicates that on the real - time portion of the contour the two leads have different chemical potentials @xmath44 , whereas @xmath45 means that on the imaginary time portion of the contour the two leads have the same chemical potential @xmath46 .",
    "henceforth we choose energies such that @xmath47 and consider a symmetrically applied bias voltage @xmath9 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the time evolution along the real - time and imaginary - time contours is expanded in powers of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",

    "[ lcontour ] ) .",
    "moreover , the latter depend only on time differences , and thus can be easily expressed in terms of their fourier transform . assuming a large band cutoff and neglecting the real part of the lead self - energy we find@xcite    @xmath81    in the voltage quench , on the other hand , the interaction is non - vanishing on the imaginary time portion of the contour ( fig .",
    "[ lcontour ] ) , while the chemical potential difference jumps instantaneously from zero ( on the imaginary branch ) to @xmath9 ( on the real branches ) .",
    "because of the time dependence of the chemical potentials , the noninteracting green functions are not time translation invariant and we can not express @xmath82 and the dot - lead correlator @xmath83 in the form of a fourier transform . instead , those functions must be computed numerically from their equations of motion , as explained in the appendix .",
    "the sign ( phase ) problem in the weak - coupling ctqmc method grows exponentially with the average perturbation order on the real - time branches , which in turn is proportional to the simulation time , while operators on the imaginary time branch do not add significantly to the sign problem . to reach long times or strong interactions",
    ", it is therefore important to reduce the average perturbation order on the real - time branches as much as possible .",
    "an essential point to note in this context is that in the particle - hole symmetric case , the parameters @xmath84 of the algorithm can be chosen such that only even perturbation orders appear in the expansion .",

    "we note in passing that the suppression of odd perturbation orders was also essential in the nonequilibrium dynamical mean field calculations of ref .  .",

    "( [ weight ] ) that the weight of a monte carlo configuration changes sign if the last spin ( corresponding to the largest time argument ) is shifted from the forward contour to the backward contour or vice versa . since the absolute value of the weight does not change , these two configurations will be generated with equal probability . as a result ,",
    "all the terms in eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) which do not involve the last operator on the contour will cancel .",

    "also , by comparing the contributions to the current of the original configuration and the one with the last operator shifted from the upper to the lower contour ( or vice versa ) , one finds that they almost ( but not completely ) cancel .",
    "the errorbars on the current can thus be substantially reduced by appropriate symmetrizations of @xmath101 .",
    "calculations based on an interaction quench from @xmath14 are particularly simple , because there are no interaction vertices ( or spins ) on the imaginary time branch , and only the real - time branches of the contour need to be considered in the simulation .",
    "temperature enters only as a parameter in the lead correlators , making it possible to treat arbitrary temperatures , including @xmath7 .    at time @xmath6 , the system is non - interacting but subject to an applied bias @xmath9 , so a current @xmath102 appropriate to the non - interacting model is flowing through the dot . at @xmath103",
    "the interaction is turned on and the system relaxes into the steady - state configuration appropriate to the interacting model . figure  [ i_t_v4 ] shows the time dependence of the current calculated for the large bias voltage @xmath104 and several interaction strengths .",
    "we see that the transient behavior is such that the current initially decreases sharply , overshoots and eventually relaxes more slowly back up into the new steady state .",
    "the interaction - dependence of the steady - state current is a consequence of the coulomb blockade physics , apparent even at the large voltages studied here .    for intermediate and large voltage bias ( @xmath105 ) and not too large interaction ( @xmath106 )",
    "the time required for convergence to the steady state is @xmath107 , essentially independent of interaction strength .",
    "given the scaling of the perturbation order ( and hence the sign problem ) with @xmath0 and @xmath31 , interactions up to @xmath108 are accessible with the current implementation .",
    "a comparison of fig .",
    "[ i_t_v4 ] to fig .",
    "13 of ref .",
    "shows that the technical improvements introduced in this paper have substantially extended the range of applicability of the weak - coupling monte carlo method ( about a factor 2 - 3 in @xmath0 or @xmath31 ) and allow us to obtain accurate results in the intermediate - to - strong correlation regime .    in fig .",
    "[ i_t_u6 ] we plot the time evolution of the current for fixed @xmath109 and several voltage biasses . for voltages",
    "@xmath110 , even though the transient behavior is clearly voltage - dependent , the current settles into the new steady state after a time @xmath111 .",
    "however , as the voltage is decreased below @xmath112 the transient time increases . at @xmath113",
    "the long time limit is attained only for @xmath114 and as @xmath9 is further decreased the approach to the asymptotic behavior becomes even slower .      to better analyse the approach to steady state at small voltages we present in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ i_t_smallv ] the time dependence of the current for several smaller voltages and two interaction strengths . for better comparison ,",
    "we plot here the ratio @xmath115 of the interacting current @xmath116 to the noninteracting current @xmath117 .",
    "one sees that as @xmath9 is decreased or @xmath0 is increased the evolution of the current from the post - quench minimum to the long - time steady state value takes an increasingly long time .",
    "since the longest accessible time is @xmath118 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath109 , the accurate measurement of @xmath116 becomes impossible in the small voltage regime .",
    "however the short - time transient behavior is accessible at all voltages .",
    "while the ratio @xmath121 is clearly voltage dependent at higher biasses , the data seem to converge as @xmath9 is reduced to a non - trivial curve with a pronounced minimum near an only weakly @xmath0-dependent time @xmath122 .",
    "we believe that the increasingly slow convergence as @xmath123 is a signature of the kondo effect , which is characterized by an energy scale which becomes exponentially small as @xmath0 increases . after the interaction",
    "quench , the kondo resonance has to be built up as time progresses , and in the limit @xmath123 , @xmath124 this requires an increasingly large number of interaction vertices and hence an increasingly long simulation time . on physical grounds",
    "one expects that the time needed to evolve into steady state is proportional to the inverse of the associated energy scale .",
    "empirically , we find that the slow relaxation becomes an issue in the linear response regime , where the non - interacting and interacting currents are very similar .",
    "for @xmath125 , where the interacting current is substantially smaller than @xmath117 , a useful estimate of @xmath116 seems possible , even though in the voltage window up to @xmath112 a small drift in the current may remain up to the longest accessible times .",
    "this drift makes it difficult to define reliable error bars on @xmath116 , but it appears unlikely that the steady state value will differ from @xmath126 by more than the largest deviation in the window @xmath127 $ ] , which we use as error estimate . for @xmath128 , an accurate estimate is not possible from the interaction quench procedure , but the current is very close to the linear response value , so the uncertainty is in fact not that important .",
    "this is illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ i_t_smallv ] , which compares the monte carlo data to the noninteracting current and results from fourth order perturbation theory.@xcite the plot also indicates as hashed region the voltage range @xmath129 where accurate measurements of the long - time limit become prohibitively difficult at @xmath7 .",
    "we will see below that this roughly corresponds to voltages smaller than the kondo temperature @xmath130 .",
    "it is also of interest to examine the temperature dependence of the current .",
    "the interplay between voltage and temperature as the kondo regime is approached presents an interesting problem .",
    "one expects that as the temperature is increased , the kondo effect gets washed out and the simulations would therefore more readily converge even at small bias voltages .",

    "[ i_beta ] . in the linear response regime ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) the ratio of the interacting current @xmath133 to the noninteracting current @xmath134 exhibits a strong temperature dependence , even at @xmath135 .",
    "the temperature dependence arises because lowering the temperature strengthens the kondo resonance and leads to an increase in the interacting current .",
    "the temperature dependence for small voltage bias ( @xmath131 ) approaches the analytical result for the temperature dependent zero - bias conductance in ref .   and thus allows us to estimate ( from the temperature at which @xmath136 ) the kondo temperature as @xmath137 , in good agreement with the _ a priori _ estimate from the standard formula@xcite @xmath138 this formula is valid in the strong correlation regime and for @xmath109 yields @xmath139 .",
    "as @xmath9 is increased the temperature dependence is weakened . at intermediate values of @xmath9 , in the coulomb blockade regime ( @xmath140 ) , the current has little temperature dependence at low @xmath20 . at large voltage bias ( @xmath104 ) , correlation effects are already weakened due to the voltage , as is evident from the increase in @xmath115 , and the almost perfect agreement with fourth order perturbation theory discussed in section  [ sec : iv ] .",
    "the current in this regime remains insensitive to temperature at low @xmath20 .",
    "an alternative procedure to calculate the steady state current of interacting quantum dots is to start from an interacting state in equilibrium ( @xmath141 ) and turn on the voltage at @xmath103 . while this approach is computationally more expensive and is restricted to nonzero temperatures , because it involves operators on the imaginary - time branch , it has the advantage that the kondo resonance in the many - body density of states is present already in the initial state .",
    "the kondo resonance is built up during the evolution along the imaginary - time branch , which does not add significantly to the sign problem .",
    "one might expect that this @xmath9-quench is particularly suitable to study the small voltage regime , because turning on a small voltage will not change the spectral function dramatically .",
    "since the voltage quench has not yet been discussed in the previous literature , we will now analyze the properties of the current after such a @xmath9-quench in some detail , and in particular its dependence on the band width ( @xmath27 ) and smoothness of the cutoff ( @xmath28 ) .",

    "[ vu46 ] ) , the interacting current overshoots and only slowly settles into the steady state , making it impossible to measure an accurate steady state value using this approach .",
    "however , as shown in the previous section , the simulation based on the @xmath0-quench provides accurate results once @xmath125 .",
    "the two simulation methods are therefore complementary in the sense that the @xmath9-quench works best for small voltage bias ( @xmath149 ) and the @xmath0-quench at larger voltage bias ( @xmath125 ) .      the temperature dependence of the current after a @xmath9-quench in the low - voltage regime ( @xmath128 and 0.5 ) is shown in fig .

    "the perturbation order on the imaginary time branch becomes so large and the individual monte carlo updates so expensive that it is increasingly difficult to reach the very high statistical accuracy required for simulations with average signs of the order @xmath155 .",

    "@xmath0 ( clearly outside the range of applicability ) fourth order perturbation theory will presumably lead to a negative differential conductance at intermediate @xmath9 .",
    "the appearance of this hump is related to the splitting of the kondo resonance as discussed in ref .  .",
    "the monte carlo results for @xmath119 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and 10 are shown by the red stars , blue circles , pink diamonds , and orange triangles , respectively . since these are @xmath0-quench results for @xmath7 , only @xmath125 data are shown . in the large voltage regime ( @xmath160 )",
    "the numerical results agree with the prediction from fourth order perturbation theory .",
    "apparently , the fast decay of the green functions for large voltage bias simplifies the diagram structure such that fourth order in @xmath161 is sufficient at @xmath160 . at intermediate voltages , @xmath162",
    ", differences between the monte carlo data and fourth order perturbation theory appear .",
    "the essentially exact numerical data show no prominent hump feature near @xmath140 , and hence no negative differential conductance in the intermediate to strong correlation regime .",
    "the hump , and the associated splitting of the kondo resonance , must therefore be an artefact of fourth order perturbation theory .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion reached in ref .",

    "[ currentlarge ] show that fourth order perturbation theory yields correct results over the entire voltage range for @xmath163 . for larger interactions , and in particular around @xmath112 more complicated self energy diagrams become important .",
    "we have discussed the implementation of the weak - coupling continuous - time monte carlo method on the l - shaped keldysh contour and the application of this formalism to the study of transport through a quantum dot .",
    "calculations based on interaction quenches from the current carrying state at @xmath14 can be restricted to the real - time contours and provide accurate steady state currents for @xmath125 and interaction strenghts @xmath164 , for arbitrary temperature and bandwidth . at finite temperature ,",
    "convergence into the steady state is considerably faster , which allows access to the small voltage regime . as an alternative method",
    ", we have introduced calculations based on voltage quenches , which start from the interacting equilibrium state and which can be used to calculate the steady state current in the small voltage regime ( @xmath149 ) at finite temperature . since the sign problem turns out to be essentially independent of the number of operators on the imaginary time branch , temperatures of order @xmath148",
    "can easily be dealt with .",
    "the @xmath9-quench approach is however not more efficient than finite - temperature @xmath0-quench calculations .",
    "we have used the methods to accurately compute the current - voltage characteristics of the half - filled anderson - impurity model in the intermediate - to - strong coupling regime .",
    "comparison to fourth order perturbation theory showed that the latter fails at voltages around @xmath112 for @xmath165 , but becomes accurate for @xmath166 .",
    "the splitting of the kondo resonance predicted by low order perturbation theory is an artefact not present in the numerical data .",
    "the results presented in this paper show that diagrammatic monte carlo is one of the most powerful numerical tools for the study of non - equilibrium systems . the accuracy of the improved weak - coupling approach and its range of applicability rivals or surpasses other state - of - the - art numerical approaches such as time - dependent dmrg.@xcite for most practical purposes the numerical problem of calculating the steady - state current through a half - filled anderson impurity model with symmetrically applied voltage can be considered as solved",
    ".    an interesting , and presumably straight - forward extension of our work would be the study of asymmetrically applied bias voltages .",
    "one of the optimizations of the monte carlo algorithm  the suppression of the odd perturbation orders  is however specific to the particle - hole symmetric model .",
    "away from particle hole symmetry , odd perturbation orders contribute to the current and therefore must be considered in the simulation .",
    "this leads to an increase in the average perturbation order and to a more severe sign problem , such that the accessible times and interaction strengths will be reduced .",
    "the optimal choice of the @xmath84-parameters in the particle - hole asymmetric case is an open problem for future investigations .",
    "another issue which should be considered is the optimal shape of the @xmath0- or @xmath9-quench . by slowly ramping up the interaction or voltage bias",
    ", it may be possible to avoid overshooting and thus observe a faster relaxation of the current into the steady state .",
