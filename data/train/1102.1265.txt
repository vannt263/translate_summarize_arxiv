    "the past decade has seen the abundant use of the sphere decoding ( sd ) algorithm @xcite as a tool for facilitating near maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding over the coherent delay - limited ( or quasi - static ) multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channel .",
    "the sd algorithm allows for efficient optimal or near optimal decoding of a large number of high rate space - time codes that map constituent constellation symbols linearly in space and time @xcite .",
    "as the algorithm s computational cost depends on the fading channel , it is generally known that in implementing the sd algorithm , one can tradeoff computational complexity for error performance by selectively choosing when to decode and when not to .",
    "equivalently , in the presence of constraints on the computational reserves that may be allocated to decoding , the algorithm is faced with the prospect of encountering channel realizations that force it to violate its run - time constraints , thus having to declare decoding outages that inevitably reduce reliability .",
    "this naturally raises the intriguing question of how large computational reserves are actually required for near ml performance .",
    "while this question is hard to answer in general , or even ask in a rigorously meaningful way , we show herein that by following @xcite and considering the decoding of sequences of codes in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) limit , not only can the question be made rigorous : it also admits surprisingly simple explicit and general answers .",
    "drawing from the diversity multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt ) setting which has already been successfully applied to concisely describe the high snr diversity exponent in the reliability analysis of reduced complexity decoders @xcite , we introduce the _ sd complexity exponent _ as a measure of complexity of the sd algorithm .",
    "the sd complexity exponent characterizes the decoding complexity in the high snr limit under the assumption that the code - rate scales with snr in order to provide a given multiplexing gain .",
    "this approach naturally takes into account the dependency of the sd complexity on the codeword density and the codebook size , as well as the snr and the fading characteristics of the wireless channel .",
    "similar to previous work on the dmt relating the code rate and probability of decoding error , it is seen that also the complexity , although hard to characterize at any finite snr , has mathematically tractable characterizations in the high snr asymptote . these characterizations in turn yield valuable insights into the behavior of the algorithm .",
    "the sd algorithm is equivalent to a branch - and - bound search @xcite over a regular tree and like most other works on sd complexity @xcite we view the number of visited nodes @xmath0 as the complexity of the algorithm . to identify an appropriate scale of interest for complexity at high snr ,",
    "it is useful to note that in order to achieve a multiplexing gain of @xmath1 the code must in the high snr limit have rate of denotes the base-2 logarithm and @xmath2 is the standard landau notation where @xmath3 implies @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , @xmath5 implies that @xmath6 for @xmath7 . ]",
    "@xmath8 bits per channel use where @xmath9 denotes the snr .",
    "consequently , the cardinality of the codebook is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the codeword length and where @xmath12 denotes equality in the snr exponent ( cf .",
    "@xcite and section [ sec : notation ] ) . in the worst case , as will be shown later , the sphere decoder is in essence forced to perform a complete search over the entire codebook , and its complexity is in this case @xmath13 .",
    "however , although feasible , this event is also highly improbable .",
    "thus , in order to quantify the probability that the sphere decoder visits a certain ( large ) number of nodes , we introduce a ( complexity ) rate - function @xmath14 over @xmath15 given implicitly by @xmath16 where @xmath0 is the complexity of the sd algorithm . in short , @xmath14 captures the decay - rate of the probability that the complexity exceeds a given snr dependent threshold @xmath17 , or equivalently , that the algorithm visits a specific sizable subset of the codebook .",
    "this decay - rate should be contrasted with the minimum probability of decoding error , which vanishes in the high snr limit as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the diversity gain of the code under maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding . we can",
    "thus judiciously argue that for any @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , the probability that the complexity exceeds @xmath17 is at high snr insignificant in comparison to the overall probability of error of the decoder .",
    "in other words : for @xmath20 such that @xmath22 , imposing a run - time limit of @xmath17 on the complexity of the algorithm  and declaring a decoding outage whenever this limit is not met  would cause a vanishing degradation in terms of the overall error probability at high snr .",
    "this motivates us to deviate from the traditional worst - case complexity measure that fails to meaningfully describe the effective complexity , and to define the sd complexity exponent @xmath23 as the infimum of all @xmath20 for which @xmath21 .",
    "in essence , @xmath24 represents the minimum computational reserves required for achieving dmt optimal performance using the sd algorithm .",
    "precise definitions of @xmath23 , and a rigorous treatment of the notion of a vanishing degradation in the overall error probability , is given in section [ sec : decoding - complexity ] and by theorem [ thrm : vanishingnew ] .",
    "the main topic of this work will then be to give closed form expressions , and bounds , for the sd complexity exponent @xmath23 when decoding different classes of full rate linear codes , to be described later , including the codes proposed in @xcite .",
    "most other works on sphere decoding complexity consider uncoded ( spatially multiplexed ) systems and asymptotic results in terms of the signal space dimension , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our work is instead more related to the analysis in @xcite , which considers the complexity tail distribution for a fixed signal space dimension .",
    "however , unlike @xcite we also incorporate the space - time codes into the analysis , as well as the snr scalings of the rates of these codes mandated by the dmt . in parallel with our work",
    "the work in @xcite provides an analysis of the complexity tail distribution for unconstrained lattice sequential decoders , in the presence of dmt optimal random lattice codes .",
    "a fundamental difference with our work and @xcite is that @xcite considers unconstrained lattice decoding , whereas we explicitly take into account the constellation boundary in the decoder .",
    "another difference is that the lattice codes considered in our work can be explicitly constructed and can have arbitrary dmt performance , unlike the random codes in @xcite which are non - explicit and which are restricted to being dmt optimal .",
    "we also take our analysis one step further by coupling the complexity tail distribution to the dmt performance of the code in order to obtain the sd complexity exponent . regarding the ultimate complexity limits on dmt optimal decoding",
    ", we have previously established that lattice reduction ( lr)-aided linear decoders are sufficient for achieving the entire dmt tradeoff at a worst - case complexity of @xmath25 , i.e. , corresponding to a complexity exponent of @xmath26 @xcite . this is lower than the sd complexity exponent that we will present in what follows .",
    "however one notable difference is that the statements made herein are fundamentally stronger in terms of error probability as they not only imply full diversity but also a vanishing snr gap to the ml decoder ( see theorem [ thrm : vanishingnew ] for details ) .",
    "such a result was not established for the decoders in @xcite .",
    "the general definition of the sd complexity exponent is given in definition  [ def : complexityexponent ] and theorem  [ thrm : vanishingnew ] then describes how sphere decoding and the time - out policies to be employed can guarantee a gap to ml that vanishes with increasing snr .",
    "however , before proceeding with the statement of these results , we first consider the code - channel system , describe the basic workings of the sd algorithm , and handle different pertinent aspects that are necessary for the exposition that follows .    following the definition of the sd complexity exponent , theorem  [ thrm :",
    "upper - bound ] gives , in the form of an optimization problem , a general upper bound @xmath27 on the sd complexity exponent @xmath23 when decoding any full rate code with multiplexing gain @xmath1 and diversity @xmath19 .",
    "an explicit closed form expression for @xmath27 is then given in theorem  [ thrm : upper - bounddmtopt ] for all dmt optimal full rate codes .",
    "the bound @xmath27 is already useful in itself in that it establishes that the sd complexity exponent is much lower than the worst - case snr exponent @xmath28 associated with a full search of the codebook .",
    "however , in the interest of also establishing the tightness of this bound , lemma  [ lm : lower - bound ] provides easy - to - check sufficient conditions on the generator matrix of the code lattice , that guarantee the tightness of @xmath27 in the most general setting . building on this , theorem  [ thrm : perm - tightness - fullrate ] establishes that , given any full rate design of arbitrary dmt performance , there is always at least one non - random sd column ordering @xcite for which @xmath29 , i.e. , for which the exact @xmath23 can be explicitly calculated from the result of theorem  [ thrm : upper - bound ] .",
    "theorem  [ thrm : layered ] goes one step further and establishes the exact sd complexity exponent , given any _ threaded _ code design and the natural column ordering , to be @xmath29 while theorem  [ thrm : layereddmt ] provides an explicit expression for @xmath23 for any dmt optimal threaded code design .",
    "surprisingly , this simple expression ( see fig .  [ fig : exponents ] ) can also serve as an upper bound on @xmath23 for any full - rate code , irrespective of the fading statistics . finally , and along a different path ,",
    "theorem  [ thrm : nvd ] establishes @xmath23 for any @xmath30 approximately universal code @xcite , irrespective of its specific structure , thus identifying the exact @xmath23 even for possibly undiscovered code structural designs , as long as these designs are approximately universal , i.e. , as long as they achieve dmt optimality for all fading statistics .",

    "[ fig : exponents ] .",
    "namely , that while @xmath23 initially increases as a function of the multiplexing gain @xmath1 , it then decreases as @xmath1 approaches its maximum value @xmath40 .",
    "the initial increase can easily be explained by the fact that the cardinality ( and density ) of the codebook @xmath42 increases as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the decrease at high multiplexing gains can be understood in light of the coupling of the complexity with the overall probability of error : in short , at high multiplexing gains the error probability is also higher and this implies that the decoder may time out for a larger set of problem instances without seriously affecting the overall performance , leading to an overall reduction in decoding complexity .",
    "pushing the code - decoder pair towards the maximal data rate does therefore not imply that the decoding complexity is maximized .",

    "however , rather than identifying and excluding a set of bad channel matrices directly , a more pragmatic approach is to impose a run - time constraint on the decoder and ensure that this constraint is such that the probability of it being violated is insignificant in relation to the probability of error .",

    "nevertheless , the fast decodable codes may be decoded by an equivalent _ real valued _ sphere decoder that performs a search over a tree with @xmath412 layers and @xmath413 branches per node , and we can compare the reported worst - case complexity of this real valued sphere decoder to the complexity of the complex valued sphere decoder considered herein .",
    "the fast decodable codes have the appealing property that the upper right @xmath414 block of the real valued @xmath415 ( cf .  )",
    "is always a diagonal matrix , regardless of the particular realization of @xmath200 .",
    "while the regular real valued sphere decoder for a @xmath376 full rate code would perform a ( bounded ) search over the entire tree , it is sufficient for the fast decodable codes to ( without loss of optimality ) perform a search over only the @xmath416 first layers , and extend each node at layer @xmath416 to a valid codeword through a faster , linear , ml decoding .",
    "this simplified version of the real valued sphere decoder can be viewed as a search over a regular tree where each node has @xmath413 children up to layer @xmath416 , but only one child per node for the @xmath416 remaining layers .",
    "consequently , the worst - case number of nodes visited by the simplified sphere decoder is @xmath417 as opposed to @xmath418 for the regular real valued sphere decoder , cf .",
