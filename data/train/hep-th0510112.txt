    "the dynamics of time dependent backgrounds in string theory has been a challenging problem for long time .",
    "recent progress on tachyon condensation by sen @xcite has been very useful for studying such time - dependent backgrounds .",
    "the rolling tachyon played an important role in studying the decay of unstable @xmath2-branes as well as annihilation of brane - antibrane pairs .",
    "the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action @xcite was used , as an effective field theory description , for the dynamics of this tachyon .",
    "it was observed that as the tachyon condenses , the unstable brane or the brane - antibrane pair can decay to form a new stable @xmath2-brane .",
    "this observation has given rise to the original idea of tachyon cosmology with the hope that the open string tachyon on the unstable brane can be the scalar field driving inflation @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for the application of tachyon in cosmology ) .",
    "this idea was also generalized to the radion field , in the case of a brane moving towards an antibrane and vice versa @xcite . but",
    "problems like incompatibility of slow - roll , too steep potential and reheating plagued the development of tachyon cosmology , though some of them could be solved via warped compactification @xcite of string theory .",
    "inspite of several attempts to overcome the problems in open string tachyon cosmology , it seems unlikely that this tachyon field is responsible for inflation .",
    "instead it is more likely to play a role as dark matter fluid @xcite .",
    "recently the dbi action has found a prominent role in the study of a different time dependent background .",
    "it describes the dynamics of a @xmath2-brane in the background of @xmath3 coincident @xmath1-branes @xcite where the @xmath2-brane is effectively a probe brane i.e. , it probes the background without disturbing it .",
    "the reason behind this phenomena is that while the tension of the @xmath1-brane goes as @xmath4 the tension of the @xmath2-brane goes as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the string coupling .",
    "thus @xmath1-branes are much heavier than the @xmath2-branes in the regime of small string coupling .",
    "geometrically this means that the @xmath1-branes form an infinite throat in space - time and the string coupling increases as we move towards the bottom .",
    "being lighter , the probe brane is gravitationally pulled towards the @xmath1-branes .",
    "since the @xmath2-brane preserves half of the supersymmetry which is different from the other half preserved by the @xmath1-branes in type - ii theory , as the probe brane comes nearer to the source brane the configuration becomes unstable .",
    "the radion becomes tachyonic and is the source for the instability .",
    "kutasov showed that there is a map between the tachyonic radion field living on the world volume of the probe brane and the rolling tachyon associated with a non - bps @xmath2-brane and thus the motion of the probe brane in the throat could be described by the condensation of the tachyon .",
    "the probe brane thus decays into tachyonic matter with a pressure that falls off exponentially to zero at late times .",
    "furthermore , it was shown , by compactifying one of the transverse direction to the source branes , it is possible to obtain a potential which resembles the potential obtained by the use of techniques of string field theory .",
    "thus it is believed that the tachyon has a geometrical origin .",
    "the above situation has been extended to a different configuration of the source brane in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this set - up",
    ", these authors examined the motion of the probe brane in the background of a ring of @xmath1-branes instead of coincident branes and obtained several interesting solutions for the probe brane in the near horizon ( throat ) approximation .",
    "it is observed that the radion field becomes tachyonic when the probe brane is confined to one dimensional motion inside the ring . following",
    "the cosmological applications of the original tachyon condensation , the condensation of the geometrical tachyon has also naturally played a role in cosmology @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall carry out detailed analysis for the role played by the geometrical tachyons in cosmology following the analysis of @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the spectra of density perturbations generated in geometrical tachyon inflation and place strong constraints on model parameters by confronting them with recent observational data .",
    "we also show an interesting possibility to use geometrical tachyon as a source for dark energy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the basic set - up for geometrical tachyon . in sec .",
    "iii we shall study inflation based upon geometrical tachyon and evaluate the spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations .",

    "iv we match tachyon potentials around the ring of the @xmath1-branes and study the possibility of reheating . in sec .",
    "v we shall apply our geometrical tachyon scenario for dark energy .",
    "we summarize our results in the final section .",
    "we begin with the background fields around @xmath3 parallel @xmath1-branes of type ii string theory . in this case",

    "the fivebranes are stretched in the directions @xmath16 and are localized in the @xmath17 directions . for coincident fivebranes an @xmath18 symmetry group of rotations around the fivebranes is preserved .",
    "this gives rise to a throat geometry .",
    "but we are interested in considering the geometry obtained from the extremal limit of the rotating @xmath1- brane solution as discussed in @xcite where the branes are continuously distributed along a ring of radius @xmath19 , which is oriented in the @xmath20 plane in the transverse space .",
    "the above @xmath18 symmetry is thus broken .",
    "the full form of the harmonic function in the throat region is then given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 parameterize the coordinates in the ring plane i.e. @xmath23 and the factor @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 we introduce a probe @xmath26-brane at the center of the circle in the background of @xmath105 branes ( see fig .  [ age ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the probe brane will be attracted towards the ring of @xmath1-branes due to gravitational interaction .",

    ". hence the number of @xmath1-branes is constrained to be @xmath212 when @xmath213 ( around gut scale ) and @xmath214 , for example , one has @xmath215 . since @xmath19 is at least greater than @xmath149 for the validity of the effective string theory , we find that @xmath216 .",
    "hence we require very large values of @xmath3 unless the brane tension @xmath217 is very much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "we note that such large values of @xmath3 automatically satisfy the throat condition ( [ throat ] ) .",
    "the energy scale @xmath178 is @xmath218 times bigger than @xmath177 by eq .",
    "( [ v1v0 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath215 mentioned above , this corresponds to @xmath219 ( around tev scale ) .",
    "therefore the tachyon has a considerable amount of energy when it begins to roll down from the the top of the hill .",
    "however if the tachyon settles down at the potential minimum in the early universe ( before the tev scale ) , the energy density @xmath177 of the tachyon does not affect the thermal history of the universe until it comes out around present epoch as dark energy .",
    "in this paper we have studied geometrical tachyon based upon the movement of a bps @xmath0-brane in the @xmath1-brane ring background . this model gives rise to a cos - type potential , which can lead to inflation as the tachyon rolls down toward a potential minimum .",
    "we carried out a careful analysis for the dynamics of inflation and resulting density perturbations .",
    "an important quantity which characterizes the amount of inflation is the quantity @xmath73 defined in eq .",
    "( [ spara ] ) .",
    "we found that @xmath73 is constrained to be @xmath220 from the observational data about the spectral index @xmath123 of scalar perturbations .",
    "the power spectrum approaches a scale - invariant one for larger @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "[ nsfig ] ) . in the large @xmath73 limit",
    "the spectral index takes a constant value given by eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) ( @xmath132 for the e - foldings @xmath76 ) .",
    "the tensor to scalar ratio grows for larger @xmath73 , but there is an upper limit @xmath221 given by eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) .",
    "since @xmath222 for @xmath76 , this well satisfies the recent observational constraint : @xmath134 at the @xmath223 level .",
    "the amplitude of scalar perturbations also places constraints on model parameters .",
    "we found that the number of @xmath1-branes satisfies the condition ( [ kcon1 ] ) for any value of @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "[ klmfig ] ) . from the requirement that the energy scale during inflation does not exceed the planck scale",
    ", we obtained an upper limit of the number of @xmath1-branes as given in eq .",
    "( [ knewcon ] ) .",
    "we note that the string coupling is weak ( @xmath141 ) provided that @xmath224 .",
    "combining this with the throat condition @xmath225 , we found another constraint : @xmath226 .",
    "this is well consistent with the condition ( [ knewcon ] ) .    in the vicinity of the ring of @xmath1-branes ( @xmath227 ) ,",
    "the tachyon potential is approximately given as eq .",
    "( [ po3d ] ) by expanding a harmonic function around the ring .",
    "this is connected to the potential inside and outside the ring by imposing matching conditions .",
    "we found that the energy scale at the potential minimum , @xmath177 , is @xmath180 times smaller than the energy scale , @xmath178 , during inflation .",
    "if we use the constraint @xmath228 coming from the condition for inflation , the energy scale @xmath177 can not be very small to explain dark energy .",
    "although the tachyon exhibits oscillations after inflation , the equation of state approaches @xmath190 as illustrated in fig .",
    "the energy density of tachyon dominates during radiation or matter dominant era , thus disturbing the thermal history of the universe .",
    "hence we need to find a way to reduce the energy density @xmath179 to obtain a viable tachyon inflation scenario .",
    "although it is difficult to explain both inflation and dark energy by using a single tachyon field , it is possible to make use of the geometrical tachyon scenario for dark energy provided that inflation is realized by another scalar field . in this case we do not have the upper limit given by eq .",
    "( [ knewcon ] ) , since the geometrical tachyon is not responsible for cmb anisotropies .",
    "we derived the condition ( [ dark ] ) for the number of @xmath1-branes to realize the energy scale of dark energy observed today .",
    "although @xmath3 is required to be very large to satisfy this constraint , it is interesting that the origin of dark energy can be explained by using the geometrical tachyon .",
    "while we have considered the motion of the bps @xmath0-brane in the plane of the ring , it is possible to investigate the case in which its motion is transverse to the ring",
    ". then the tachyon map yields a cosh - type potential @xcite , in which case we do not need to worry for the continuity condition around the ring .",
    "since there remains an energy density @xmath229 at the potential minimum ( @xmath230 ) , we expect that cosmological evolution may not change much compared to the model discussed in this paper .",
    "nevertheless it is certainly of interest to investigate this case in more details to distinguish between two geometrical tachyon scenarios .",
