    "if heating does not promptly desorb cs molecules from grain mantles , then this species likely makes a poor probe of the kinematics in the presumed infall zone .    since the density field",

    "( 2003 ) to analyze the structure of b335 using the interferometer measurements directly in the visibility domain , without producing images .",

    "the 1.2  mm data show a visibility profile that flattens with increasing baseline lengths beyond @xmath20  k@xmath21 .",
    "the start of this change in slope is also apparent in the 3.0  mm data .",
    "we interpret the flattening in the profiles as the separation between the extended envelope that dominates the flux at short baselines from a compact source component that persists to the longest baselines .",
    "to determine the central position , and to test whether the compact component is resolved , we fit an elliptical gaussian to the long baseline visibilities , @xmath22  k@xmath21 .",
    "the fitted gaussian is offset from the pointing center by ( @xmath23 ) , giving coordinates for the peak @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( j2000 ) consistent with earlier determinations of the protostar position .",

    "figure  2 shows an image made from the 1.2  mm long baseline visibilities in the standard way , which highlights the compact source component .",
    "we attribute essentially all of this compact flux component to thermal dust emission .",
    "reipurth et al .",
    "( 2002 ) detected a subarcsecond scale radio source at 3.6  cm at this position , elongated in the outflow direction , with variable flux @xmath32 mjy .",
    "but assuming the free - free emission from this ionized radio jet has a typical flat spectral index , it makes a negligble contribution to the emission at 1.2  mm .",
    "the shape of the sythesized beam matches the shape of the fitted gaussian , but since the fit is to the raw visibility data , the sythesized beam does not directly affect the results , aside from there being inherently more resolution ( longer baselines ) east - west than north - south .",
    "the orientation of the fitted gaussian is consistent with a source that is elongated perpendicular to the axis of the bipolar outflow seen on larger scales ( essentially east - west , e.g.  hirano et al .",
    "we therefore identify the compact component as a circumstellar disk .",
    "we caution that the fitted compact source size is only marginally resolved , and that the envelope emission may yet contaminate the signal , even on these subarcsecond size scales .",
    "in addition , if the compact component is a disk , then its outer radius is likely larger than the fitted gaussian fwhm size , perhaps by a factor of up to @xmath33 , because the emission profile of a disk with realistic density and temperature distributions is more centrally peaked than a gaussian ( mundy et al .",
    "1996 , wilner et al .",
    "this suggests a conservative upper limit of 100  au for the disk radius .",
    "we compare the b335 visibilities from both antenna configurations to theoretical models of protostellar structure by constructing synthetic visibilities , taking account of ( 1 ) the dust continuum radiative transfer , and ( 2 ) the specifics of the observations , including the exact @xmath19 sampling and primary beam attenuation . in brief ,",
    "@xmath34 pixel model intensity images ( resolution @xmath35  pixel@xmath36 at 1.2  mm , @xmath37  pixel@xmath36 at 3  mm ) are calculated using the full planck function for the emissivity and integrating the radiative transfer equation through the model globule .",
    "each model is normalized to a flux at 1.3  mm of @xmath38  mjy within a circular aperture ( top - hat ) of radius @xmath17 based on the measurement of shirley et al .",
    "this normalization effectively provides a measurement at zero - spacing of the interferometer and is essential for determining the envelope structure . without this information , the model visibility profiles would float freely in normalization and the constraints that can be placed on the density structure are therefore much weaker ( see e.g.  looney et al .  (",
    "2003 ) where models with @xmath39 and @xmath40 generally can not be distinguished . )",
    "observations are simulated by performing an fft , assuming a gaussian shape for the primary beams ( 1.2  mm fwhm @xmath17 , 3  mm fwhm @xmath18 ) .",
    "the @xmath19 sampling is achieved by interpolating the real and imaginary parts of the resulting visibility grid .",
    "the center is fixed to match the position of the compact component from the elliptical gaussian fit to the long baseline 1.2  mm data .    _",
    "compact component. _ the compact component of dust emission in b335 evident at long baselines is likely due to a circumstellar disk .",
    "since the size of the compact component from the gaussian fit ( @xmath41 ) is smaller than the fringe spacing on the longest baseline ( @xmath42 ) , we calculate the contribution of this compact component to the visibilities by modeling it as an unresolved point - like source .",
    "we assume the compact component to contribute a flux @xmath43 , for a disk that is optically thin at millimeter wavelengths with a dust opacity index @xmath44 of unity ( e.g.  beckwith et al .",
    "if instead the disk were partly optically thick at these wavelengths , then its spectral index might be closer to 2 .",
    "experiments with the fitting procedure showed that both the inferred 1.2  mm flux of the compact component and the envelope density distribution are not sensitive to this spectral index assumption , and we adopt the optically thin model .",
    "this lack of dependence on the disk spectral index occurs because the flux of the compact component at 3  mm is not tightly constrained due to the lower spatial resolution at this longer wavelength ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "_ envelope density models. _ we fix attention on the spherically symmetric broken power law models for the protostellar envelope density distribution , based on the success of this description in matching the previous lower resolution data . the effect on the inferred density profiles of departures from spherical symmetry caused by the bipolar outflow",
    "was investigated by harvey et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and found to be small compared to other sources of systematic uncertainty ( e.g.  the dust temperature distribution ) .",
    "the density models are of the form : @xmath45 the fixed outer power law index of @xmath46 , turn - over radius of @xmath47  au ( @xmath48 ) , and outer radius of @xmath49  pc are based on the near - infrared dust extinction measurements of harvey et al .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the outer boundary assumption due to the small field of view of the pdbi antennas .    _ envelope dust temperature. _ the models necessarily include assumptions about the dust temperature distribution , in addition to the density field .",
    "based on the study of shirley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we adopt the following for the temperature : @xmath50 i.e  the temperature falls as a power law , reaching a constant value of @xmath51  k for radii beyond @xmath52  au .",
    "this is a close approximation to the results of detailed calculations of balanced heating and cooling . for b335",
    ", an inner breakdown to this behavior is expected within a radius of @xmath53  au , where the temperature gradient rises sharply due to the envelope becoming optically thick to infrared radiation .",
    "this scale is at the resolution limit of the new data , so emission from this warm central region would appear as an unresolved point source in our visibility data . since the compact component of the flux",
    "is constrained by the long baseline data , this possible breakdown in the temperature distribution does not affect the inferred density profile of the envelope ( for @xmath54  au ) , although it may contaminate the flux that we attribute to a circumstellar disk . to investigate the degree of envelope contamination , we assume that the envelope density distribution extends to the center , and that the temperature increases steeply within a radius of 60  au ( shirley et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this case",
    "the mass of the warm region is only @xmath55  m@xmath56 . to contaminate the compact flux by 50%",
    "requires the temperature to increase within this region by @xmath57  k above the assumed distribution , equivalent to an average temperature in the region of @xmath58  k. if the envelope density distribution is disrupted so that it does not extend to the protostar location , then it is even harder for the envelope to contaminate the disk flux .",
    "_ envelope dust opacity. _",
    "we assume that the dust opacity does not change with radius , although this approximation will likely break down in the innermost regions of the envelope where the temperature becomes high enough that the ice mantles evaporate ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) . for the dust opacity at millimeter wavelengths ,",
    "we assume a power law @xmath59 with index @xmath60 ( e.g.  looney , mundy , & welch 2000 ) . in the absence of absolute calibration uncertainties ,",
    "the spectral index @xmath44 would control the relative normalization of the 1.2  mm and 3  mm profiles . in practice ,",
    "the relative normalization of the 1.2  mm and 3  mm profiles from each of the antenna configuration are consistent with the assumed index , taking account the systematic uncertainties in the calibrations .",
    "we analyze the individual visibility records , and avoid binning the data to prevent loss of information .",
    "we maximize the probability distribution of a simultaneous fit to both datasets , by minimizing a modified @xmath61 of the form : @xmath62 } } \\ ] ] where the @xmath63 are the visibility data points with uncertainty @xmath64 , and the @xmath65 are the data points for a model with power law index @xmath66 .",
    "the sum extends over both wavelengths , and over observations from both array configurations .",
    "the parameters @xmath67 allow us to include the observational uncertainties , namely the uncertainty in the flux calibration of each dataset ( each wavelength from each configuration ) , and the @xmath68 uncertainty in the shirley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) measurement used in the flux normalization .",
    "this is achieved by allowing the model visibilities to be scaled by the constrained parameter @xmath67 , assumed to be a gaussian random variable with mean @xmath69 and standard deviation @xmath70 .",
    "we adopt @xmath71 for the two 1.2  mm datasets , making the assumption of two independent gaussian distributions contributing to the probability distribution of each scaling factor .",
    "while this is not quite accurate ( since the normalization is part of both @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) , this formulation reduces the number of fitted parameters and provides for realistic values of the scaling factors .",
    "these scaling factors essentially provide for the best possible cross - calibration for the observations from the two antenna configurations .",
    "for the two 3  mm datasets , we allow the scaling parameters to be free , by adopting @xmath74 , essentially to account for the uncertain dust opacity spectral index .",
    "since the models are non - linear in the fitting parameters , we analyze the uncertainty in the best - fit model parameters using the monte carlo technique known as the _ bootstrap _ ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) . in brief , the dataset is resampled @xmath75 times , each time the fitting process is repeated and the best - fit parameters recorded , until the distribution of best - fit parameters is well sampled .",
    "the width of the distribution provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the parameters that best fit the original dataset .",
    "the best fit model has envelope density power law index @xmath1 and a point source component of flux @xmath4  mjy .",
    "the constrained scaling parameters at 1.2  mm are @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the free scaling parameters at 3  mm are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the unscaled best - fit model is offset to higher normalization than the d  configuration 1.2  mm data , and to lower normalization than the a  configuration 1.2  mm data .",
    "we interpret these results as most likely due to the uncertainties in the overall flux calibration of the two datasets , low for the former and high for the latter .",
    "the magnitudes of the scaling factors are consistent with this interpretation . in this context , the free scalings for the 3  mm datasets are close enough to unity that the data are consistent with an assumed dust opacity spectral index of unity .",
    "figure  1 shows a plot of the various visibility datasets , renormalized by @xmath80 , binned in @xmath19 distance , along with the best fit model , and the two components of the best fit model .",
    "we find that the density profile of b335 has power law index @xmath1 within the inner @xmath81  au .",
    "this result is remarkably consistent with the @xmath82 expectation for free - fall collapse .",
    "the overall density structure of b335 can be obtained by combining the inner behavior determined in the present study with the steeper outer falloff determined from near - infrared extinction work ( harvey et al .",
    "2001 ) and low resolution millimeter and submillimeter studies ( shirley et al .  2000 , motte & andr 2001 ) .",
    "the extinction data showed an average power law index of @xmath83 over the region 3500 - 25,000  au , consistent with the @xmath39 index characteristic of a hydrostatic region supported by thermal pressure ( the index is not significantly affected by the small overlap with the region in which the index decreases ) . joining these two regions together , for the adopted temperature distribution and mass opacity at 1.2  mm ,",
    "the density distribution of molecular hydrogen is : @xmath84 the corresponding enclosed mass distribution is : @xmath85 if one accounts for the asymmetry of the b335 core by modeling the outflow with a bipolar hollow cone , then the normalization of the density distribution away from the outflow must be increased by a small factor , @xmath86% for a @xmath87 semi - opening angle .",
    "this determination of the inner density structure of b335 has a precision that is unique amongst protostellar cores , and it provides the best evidence yet for the standard picture of isolated star formation , whereby the inner regions of an initially hydrostatic isothermal envelope collapse onto the center in near free - fall conditions ( shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) . as noted by harvey et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , while the b335 density distribution is qualitatively similar to the density distribution of the inside - out collapse model , the two distributions are quantitatively different in the inner regions . in the inside - out collapse model , the local density gradient within the infall radius",
    "is significantly less steep than @xmath40 , ranging from roughly unity to 1.5 .",
    "such a shallow density profile is ruled out by the dust emission analysis .",
    "the new long baselines observations reveal the contribution of the central compact source to the total dust emission and thereby remove the previously dominant source of systematic error from the envelope density structure determination ( see harvey et al .",
    "the remaining sources of systematic error , of which the most important is the detailed shape of the temperature distribution , likely contribute a systematic uncertainty of @xmath5 . in the future , high resolution observations of b335 at submillimeter wavelengths may help to mitigate the uncertainties associated with the temperature distribution .",
    "spatially resolved information on the optically thin emission distribution at a third wavelength that is sufficiently short to be outside the rayleigh - jeans regime for the majority of the dense core should allow for partly breaking the degeneracy between temperature , density and opacity .",
    "such observations may be obtained with the submillimeter array ( sma ) on mauna kea , which is soon to be commissioned , and eventually the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) in chile , now under construction .",
    "it is also clearly desirable to make high resolution spectral line observations of species not subject to depletion and unaffected by the bipolar outflow in order to best probe the dense core dynamics .",
    "the fitted flux of @xmath4  mjy from the b335 disk is typical of the ( distance corrected ) @xmath88 to 300  mjy range of fluxes from disks around the t  tauri stars observed by beckwith et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and osterloh & beckwith ( 1995 ) .",
    "the disk flux is at the low end of the range for the disks in the class  0 sources observed in the perseus region by brown et al .",
    "( 2000 ) using the cso - jcmt interferometer at 0.87  mm and by looney , mundy , & welch ( 2003 ) using bima at 2.7  mm ( for @xmath89 )",
    ". however , the perseus sample is highly biased , as the sources were chosen on the basis of their large millimeter fluxes .",
    "the @xmath90  au fwhm spatial scale of the compact component in b335 at 1.2  mm is similar to the sizes measured for the perseus class  0 disks ( brown et al .",
    "2000 ) , though it is not clear how accurately the gaussian size measurement predicts the actual b335 disk radius . given that disks result from conservation of angular momentum during the collapse process , a small disk radius and disk flux might be expected in b335 because of its relatively low rotation rate ( frerking , langer & wilson 1987 , zhou 1995 ) . in the context of the terebey , shu & cassen ( 1984 ) model of inside - out collapse with rotation , the centrifugal radius for b335",
    "is predicted to be only 3  au , or @xmath91 , far too small to resolve .",
    "however , such a small disk could not produce the observed 1.2  mm flux without an unfeasibly high dust temperature of @xmath92  k. the radius of the b335 disk is clearly much larger than predicted by the simple model of inside - out collapse with rotation .",
    "the flux from the disk provides a measure of the disk mass , though the large uncertainty in the normalization of the dust opacity dominates the mass calculation . assuming @xmath93",
    "@xmath94  g@xmath95 , a simple estimate is @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the mass weighted mean temperature .",

    "( 1990 ) give temperatures that are generally lower by a factor of 2 to 3 , and disk mass estimates that are higher by the same factor ( occupying a range @xmath99 to 0.3  m@xmath56 ) .",
    "for b335 , the appropriate mean temperature may be higher than for a disk around a t - tauri star because of the surrounding envelope with substantial optical depth in the infrared that inhibits cooling ( natta 1993 ) .",
    "but since the b335 disk flux is typical of t  tauri stars , it seems likely that the disk mass is not unusually small or large .",
