    "in this work we consider the numerical integration of the one - dimensional burgers equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent time and distance in x - direction respectively , and @xmath5 is the kinematic viscosity parameter related to the reynolds number @xmath6 , was first given its steady state solutions by bateman @xcite .",
    "it was noticed later , by burgers @xcite , this equation is used in a mathematical modeling of turbulence .",
    "it is exploited in a different applied fields , such as in the context of gas dynamics , in a modeling shock waves , traffic flows and continuous stochastic process . on the other hand",
    ", burgers equation can be solved exactly for several initial data by hopf - cole transformation and the solutions can be represented as a fourier series expansion @xcite . for different initial data ,",
    "exact solutions are listed in @xcite .",
    "since the exact solutions are available for some limiting cases , i.e. some set of initial functions , it is natural to consider burgers equation for testing the performance of a numerical solver .",
    "thus , many interesting papers on the numerical solution of burgers equation based on the finite difference , the finite element , the boundary element and the spectral methods exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "jain and raja @xcite have seperated burgers equation in two sub models , namely , the convection and the diffusion part , then used the finite difference method to solve each model problem successively and called as `` splitting - up technique '' .",
    "similar to this strategy , jain and holla @xcite have used the cubic spline method and called `` two - time - level splitting '' .",
    "furthermore , the new algorithms along with the cubic spline method is proposed in @xcite , which treats burgers equation as three sub problems , referred as `` three - time - level splitting '' .",
    "we refer to @xcite for time and space splitting techniques applied to the burgers equation and the modified burgers equation along quintic b - spline collocation procedure .    however , godunov and strang splitting methods have been applied to the generalized korteweg - de vries equations(kdv ) and convergence properties of the both methods have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , a new analytical approach to the godunov and strang splitting methods presented in @xcite for the kdv equation and in @xcite for the particular examples of the pdes with burgers nonlinearity , by using requirement of a well - posedness theory in sobolev spaces . a wide variety of techniques have been considered up to recently , which have been limited to low orders of accuracy in time due to the combination of nonlinearity and stiffness in burgers equation . to obtain high order accurate solutions of stiff pdes ,",
    "the fourth - order modified exponential time - differencing method is presented in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested in numerical integration of the burgers equation using high order splitting methods with complex coefficients and extrapolation methods .",
    "such procedures could allow us to integrate irreversible systems .",
    "splitting methods with complex coefficients have been recently presented for the numerical integration of the autonomous and non - autonomous parabolic equations in @xcite .",
    "since the burgers equation involves small viscosity parameter @xmath7 , we also consider splitting methods which designed for the perturbation of an exactly solvable problems ( or can be easily approximated numerically ) . in usual ,",
    "the presence of small @xmath7 is considered to be a numerical challenge .",
    "however utilizing perturbed system can take the advantage of smaller parameter .",
    "it has been shown that splitting methods with real coefficients of order higher than two involve negative time steps @xcite and therefore this is undesirable for burgers equation .",
    "for this reason , we consider splitting methods with complex coefficients having positive real part and with real positive coefficients obtained by applying extrapolation techniques to a lower order splitting method .",
    "we use spectral methods for periodic boundary conditions , finite difference and weighted essentially nonoscillatory ( weno ) schemes for dirichlet boundary conditions as spatial discretization techniques .",
    "this allows us to adopt methods for system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) to solve the partial differential equation ( [ eq : burger ] ) numerically .",
    "let us consider the nonlinear parabolic pde of the form @xmath8 @xmath9 , and where the ( possibly unbounded ) operators @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 generate @xmath13 semi - groups for positive @xmath3 over a finite or infinite banach space .    for the sake of simplicity , we write the non - linear equation in the ( apparently ) linear form @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the lie operators associated to @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 which act on functions of @xmath18 .",
    "the formal solution of the ( [ eq : paralie ] ) is given by @xmath19 , which is a short way to write @xmath20 the framework of the splitting method for solving numerically ( [ eq : paralie ] ) is to decompose the solutions into the exactly ( or numerically ) solvable two subproblems @xmath21 and treat them seperately .",
    "it is possible to replace notation of the formal solution of the ( [ eq : paralie ] ) , @xmath22 , by the flow map @xmath23 in the nonlinear case .",
    "let denote by @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) the exact @xmath27-flows for each problem in ( [ eq.split_aut ] ) ( and for a sufficiently small time step , @xmath27 ) .",
    "then the simplest method within this class is @xmath28 which is known as the first order _ lie - trotter splitting _ method .",
    "a splitting method @xmath29 has order @xmath30 , if @xmath31 .",
    "if one composes lie - trotter method and its adjoint @xmath32 with a half time step , one obtains second order time symmetric methods @xmath33 @xmath34 which are referred as _ strang splitting _ based on the pattern @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . for the nonlinear case",
    "high - order approximations based on the pattern @xmath36 can be obtained @xmath37 or , equivalently @xmath38 where m is usually referred as number of steps of the method , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are real or complex numbers(to be chosen ) depending on the desired order of method @xcite .",
    "if one takes @xmath41 , then one transforms the pattern @xmath36 into the pattern @xmath35 with a different computational cost .",
    "notice that the difference between the order of the indices in equations ( [ eq : splittingmethod ] ) and ( [ eq : splittingmethod1 ] ) is appeared by the lie - derivative action and called as _ vertauschungssatz _ @xcite .",
    "splitting methods with real coefficients of order greater than two necessarily contain some negative coefficients .",
    "in general , the semi - groups are not well defined for negative time steps .",
    "positivity requirement on the coefficients prevents the use of splitting methods of order greater than two when operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 generates a @xmath13 semi - group of propagators .",
    "independently , the results in @xcite and @xcite resolve the open question for the existence of the splittings methods of order two in the context of semi - groups . additionally , the authors of @xcite and @xcite derived a new broad class of splitting methods with complex coefficients of order 3 to 14 by a method which is referred `` triple - jump composition procedure '' , and presented theoretical error bounds in the linear case .",
    "at least formally , all results given in @xcite can instantly be stretched out to nonlinear case by replacing all exponentials with the corresponding nonlinear flows .",
    "the numerical results for the autonomous and non - autonomous nonlinear cases can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , as already mentioned , one can consider using splitting methods designed for near integrable system to solve burgers equation because of the term involving small viscosity parameter @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 is dominant part , i.e @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , one can write equations ( [ eq : paralie ] ) as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is small parameter , i.e @xmath48 .",
    "let us consider the symmetric second - order methods ( [ eq : strang2 ] ) with @xmath43 replaced by @xmath49 for the autonomous case in the exponential form @xmath50+\\frac{1}{12 } h^{3}[\\epsilon b,[a,\\epsilon b]]+\\,\\cdots \\,}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the lie bracket ( or commutator ) @xmath51 $ ] , which is defined as @xmath52=ab - ba$ ] for a and b denoted in ( [ eq : lieoprt ] ) , arises from the application of the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula@xcite to the left - hand side of ( [ eq : strlocerr ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see the local error of the above method is of order @xmath53 and originates in the commutators at third order in h , i.e @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "essentially , a small parameter @xmath47 is considered to be @xmath56 or at least @xmath57 .",
    "thus , one can cancel the dominant error terms in @xmath47 rather than in @xmath27 for the general composition ( [ eq : splittingmethod1 ] ) with @xmath43 replaced by @xmath49 and built methods which take advantage of this relevant property by choosing the coefficients @xmath58 .",
    "an @xmath59-stage symmetric @xmath60 compositions given by @xmath61 with @xmath62 , and @xmath63 compositions are given by @xmath64 with @xmath65 .    in these cases , the dominant error terms can be read as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is considered as relatively large values .",
    "then , one can take into account the small parameter @xmath47 in the accuracy of the desired splitting methods .",
    "let @xmath68 be an effective order of a method with @xmath69 that yields the local error @xmath70 .",

    "splitting methods with complex coefficients are computationally more costly than with real coefficients .",
    "to reduce the computational cost some new high order methods for which only one set of coefficients complex valued are proposed in @xcite . additionally , the effective order of @xmath79 method is obtained in @xcite with the coefficients @xmath80 being positive and real valued , whereas the coefficients @xmath81 being complex valued with positive real part . for non - autonomous perturbed systems , this last method is most efficient and stable .",
    "considering initial value problem for the viscous burgers equation of the form @xmath82 we now describe the framework of the splitting method , that is , to solve in succession the conservation law @xmath83 and the diffusion equation @xmath84    let us denote by @xmath85 the maps associated to the exact solution ( or a sufficiently accurate numerical approximation ) of the ( [ eq : conservation ] ) , ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) respectively",
    ". then , we approximate the solution of ( [ eq : vburger ] ) as @xmath86 where @xmath29 given by ( [ eq : splittingmethod])(or [ eq : splittingmethod1 ] ) for small time step @xmath27 .    the readers can be suspicious about composing the solutions from ( [ eq : conservation ] ) and ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) since ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) always produces smooth solutions while ( [ eq : conservation ] ) results in discontinuous shock solution within a certain time interval depending on initial profile .",
    "we refer the readers two important research papers on this issue .",
    "holden et.al @xcite showed that if the initial data are sufficiently regular , the strang splitting method converges to the smooth solution of full equation provided that the splitting step size for burgers step ( [ eq : conservation ] ) is kept under control .",
    "another study by holden et.al @xcite proved that splitting solution converges to the weak solution of the full equation assuming that the splitting procedure is convergent .      in this section",
    "we consider the methods which have been used to approximate the diffusion equation ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) .",
