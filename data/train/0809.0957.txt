    "we offer the idea that for every @xmath13 the 3d space - like metric @xmath14 is realised with some probability @xmath15 where the parameter @xmath13 describes the evolution of the metric @xmath16 under the ricci flow .",
    "usually such probability is connected with path integral .",
    "we offer the idea that this probability is connected with a perelman s functional @xmath17 on a rescaled ricci flow as @xmath18 in the consequence of the property @xmath19 .",
    "then the ricci flow is a statistical system where every metric @xmath14 is a microscopical state .",
    "the notion of a spacetime foam was introduced by wheeler @xcite for the description of the possible complex structure of spacetime on the planck scale ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the exact mathematical description of this phenomenon is very difficult and even though there is a doubt : does the feynman path integral in the gravity contain a topology change of the spacetime ?",
    "this question spring up as ( according to the morse theory ) the singular points must arise by topology changes .",
    "in such points the time arrow is undefined that leads in difficulties at the definition of the lorentzian metric , curvature tensor and so on .",
    "the ricci flows were introduced by hamilton @xcite over 25 years ago .",

    "quantum gravity remains a theorists playground , an arena for theoretical experiments which may or may not stand the test of time .",
    "the two leading candidates for a quantum theory of gravity today are string theory and loop quantum gravity .",
    "one can find a thorough introduction to string theory in textbook @xcite , and a review of loop quantum gravity in ref . @xcite . despite some 70 years of active research ,",
    "no one has yet formulated a consistent and complete quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the failure to quantize gravity rests in part on technical difficulties .",
    "general relativity is a complicated and highly nonlinear theory .",
    "but the real problems are almost certainly deeper : quantum gravity requires a quantization of spacetime itself , and at a fundamental level we do not know what that means .",
    "our point of view is that in quantum gravity it is necessary to separate two problems : the first one is the quantization of very strongly self - interacting gravitational field ( metric ) , the second one is the problem of topology change in quantum gravity .",
    "we think that it is two different problems . for the first problem",
    "we need a non - perturbative quantization technique ( in some more weakly sense this problem one can find in quantum chromodynamics ",
    "so called confinement problem ) . in this paper",
    "we propose an approach for the second problem : we conjecture that a quantum wormhole in a spacetime foam may be described on the ricci flow language .",
    "the mathematicians use this language for the description of topology change .",
    "our approach is that the quantum wormhole can be described as a statistical system and corresponding probability is connected with perelman functional .",
    "in this section we follow to ref .  @xcite .",
    "ricci flow is a means of processing the metric @xmath21 by allowing it to evolve under @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ricci curvature ; @xmath13 is a parameter ; @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the coordinate on a manifold @xmath2 .",
    "the ricci flow describes the evolution of the metric @xmath21 in during of the parameter @xmath13 . in ref .",
    "@xcite such reply for the question `` ricci flow : what is it , and from where did it come '' is given : ",
    "@xmath26 the flow can be used to deform @xmath21 into a metric distinguished by its curvature .",
    "for example , if @xmath2 is two - dimensional , the ricci flow deforms a metric conformally to one of constant curvature , and thus gives a proof of the two - dimensional uniformisation theorem . more generally , the topology of @xmath2 may preclude the existence of such distinguished metrics , and the ricci flow can then be expected to develop a singularity in finite time . ] .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior of the flow may still serve to tell us much about the topology of the underlying manifold .",
    "the strategy of the investigation is to stop a flow , and then carefully perform `` surgery '' on the evolved manifold , exciting any singular regions before continuing the flow .",
    "provided we understand the structure of finite time singularities sufficiently well , we may hope to keep track of the change in topology of the manifold under surgery , and reconstruct the topology of the original manifold from a limiting flow , together with the singular regions removed . ",
    "let us introduce the functional @xmath27 \\",

    "it means that @xmath39 and @xmath40 represents the probability density of a particle evolving under brownian motion , backwards in time .",
    "it allows us to define the classical , or `` boltzman - shannon '' entropy @xmath41 or a renormalized version of the classical entropy @xmath42       \\right \\}. \\label{ric-110}\\ ] ] the @xmath43functional applied to this backwards brownian diffusion on a ricci flow also arises via the renormalized classical entropy @xmath44 @xmath45 we would like to offer the following physical interpretation of the ricci flow : the problem here is that at @xmath4 ( where @xmath0 is some parameter depending on @xmath46 ) the metric blow up and a singularity appears .",
    "the possible solution of this problem is rescaling or renormalizing the ricci flow .    the curvature of a ricci flow blow up in magnitude at a singularity and it is necessary to work towards a theory of `` blowing - up '' that we can rescale a flow more and more as we get closer and closer to a singularity . in ref .",
    "@xcite we read : `` the usual method to understand the structure of singularities is to rescale or renormalize the solution on a sequence converging to the singularity to make the solution bounded and try to pass to a limit of the renormalization .",
    "such a limit solution serves as a model for the singularity , and one hopes ... that the singularity models have special features making them much simpler than an arbitrary solution of the equation . ''    in appendix  [ app1 ] the mathematical definitions and theorems are given which are necessary for mathematical understanding of ricci flow rescaling .",
    "for the physical undersctanding of the idea presented here the theorem  [ compactnes_ricci ] is necessary only .",
    "the theorem states that there exists a regular `` singularity '' model ( @xmath47 in the notations of appendix  [ app1 ] ) .",
    "such singularity models do in fact have important features making them much simpler than general solutions of the ricci flow . if @xmath48 is noncompact , then @xmath48 is diffeomophic to @xmath49 or a quotient of these spaces . if @xmath48 is compact , then @xmath48 is diffeomophic to @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "thus we modify the physical interpretation of the ricci flow as follows : the last item means that the perelman s functional is calculated on above mentioned singularity model .",
    "in this section we would like to apply the ricci flow for the description of appearing / disappearing quantum wormhole in spacetime foam .",
    "the strategy of this investigation is following : on the first step we should have a wormhole solution in 4d einstein gravity with characteristic sizes in planck region ; on the second step we should obtain a ricci flow with initial conditions as above mentioned wormhole .      in ref .",
