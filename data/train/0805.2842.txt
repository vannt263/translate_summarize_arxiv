    "m87 is a nearby giant elliptical galaxy ( distance = @xmath0 mpc [ @xcite])possessing a one - sided jet with projected distance @xmath1 2 kpc and bright in radio , optical and x - ray energies .",
    "the jet structure is very well studied in radio ( @xcite ) , ir ( @xcite ) and optical ( @xcite ) bands .",
    "prior to _ chandra _ , m87 jet was not very well studied at x - ray energies due to the limited angular resolution of earlier x - ray telescopes , _ einstein _ and rosat .",
    "however , _",
    "chandra _ due to its better spatial resolution is able to resolve many fainter knots of m87 jet which are observed only in radio and optical bands earlier .",
    "moreover , the position of these knots in x - ray energies are nearly coincident with their radio / optical counterparts(@xcite ) .",
    "also m87 is the only radiogalaxy ( other than cena(@xcite ) ) which is detected in gev - tev energies(@xcite ) .",
    "initially it was not well understood whether the tev gamma - ray emission region is close to nucleus(@xcite ) or from the knot hst-1(@xcite ) .",
    "however the detection of m87 by hess confirmed the high energy emission from the region close to the nucleus(@xcite ) .",
    "recent veritas detection of vhe emission from m87 ( @xcite ) again suggests the emission may not be from hst-1 .",
    "considering the fact m87 jet is misaligned to the observer , explaining this tev gamma - ray emission required a modified model other than the one used to explain blazar emission .",
    "@xcite explained tev gamma - ray emission due to radiative cooling of electrons accelerated by strong rotation induced electric fields in the vacuum gaps in black hole magnetospheres .",
    "@xcite proposed a multi - blob model with several plasma blobs moving in the large opening angle of the jet formation zone .",
    "tev gamma - ray emission is explained as doppler boosted synchrotron self compton radiation by the blobs moving close to the line of sight .",
    "the radio - to - optical emission from the knots of m87 jet are quite well accepted as synchrotron emission due to cooling of relativistic non - thermal electrons by the magnetic field therein(@xcite ) .",
    "the flux and the spectral indices at x - ray energies indicates a possible continuation of synchrotron emission of the radio - to - optical spectra with the change in the spectral index beyond optical energies(@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "simple theoretical models viz . continuous injection model ( hereafter ci ) ( @xcite ) and one time injection model ( @xcite )",
    "were unable to explain the observed x - ray flux and/or the spectral index .",
    "the ci model considers the synchrotron emission from non - thermal electrons injected continuously into a region with tangled magnetic field .",
    "but the x - ray flux predicted by this model is more than the observed flux(@xcite ) . in one time injection model ,",
    "a burst of electrons are injected at @xmath2 and allowed to evolve with ( @xcite ) or without pitch angle scattering ( @xcite ) . the model with pitch angle scattering under",
    "predicts the x - ray flux and the one without pitch angle scattering fail to predict the observed x - ray spectral index ( @xcite ) .",
    "however ci and one time injection models are able to reproduce the broadband spectra of the knots of various agn detected by_chandra _ ( @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    "we propose a two zone model to explain the non - thermal emission from the knots of m87 jet .",
    "we consider a situation where a power - law distribution of electrons are accelerated by an shock .",
    "the initial particle spectrum which is accelerated by the shock can be an outcome of an earlier acceleration process .",
    "the particles accelerated by the shock cool via synchrotron radiation in a homogeneous magnetic field behind it .",
    "the present model is similar to a situation where particles accelerated by an external shock are advected downstream to be accelerated further by an internal shock .",
    "two zone models were in fact used by various authors to explain the spectral and the temporal behaviour of blazars ( @xcite ) . in the next section , the formulation of the present model and the parameters involved are discussed . in ",
    "3 we discuss the results of the fitting using the present model and compare the present model with the other existing models .",
    "we consider the acceleration of a power - law distribution of particles ( which may be a relic of past acceleration process ) at a shock front and cool via synchrotron radiation in a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "we treat the present scenario as a two zones : one around the shock front where the particles are accelerated ( ar ) and downstream region where they loose most of their energy through synchrotron process ( cr ) .",
    "this model is then used to explain the radio - optical - x - radio spectra of the knots in m87 jet .",
    "we assume the cr to be a spherical blob of radius @xmath3 with tangled magnetic field @xmath4 and ar is assumed to be a very thin region with magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "power law distribution of electrons are continuously injected into ar and are accelerated by the shock characterized by an acceleration timescale @xmath6 .",
    "particles are then accelerated at an rate @xmath7 to a maximum energy determined by the loss processes .",

    "zepf(2005 ) ) and x - ray((perlman @xmath52 wilson(2005 ) ) .",
    "the observed spectra of knot e is fitted with ci model ( dashed line ) .",
    "errors in radio and optical are too small to be seen and hence not shown in the figure.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we applied the above model to explain the knots d , f , a and b of m87 jet and the results of the fitting are shown in figure  [ fig ] and the parameters used for the fit are given in table 1 . the spectrum of knot e can be explained by simple ci model and the parameters we quote corresponds to ci model .",
    "we did not model knot c due to significant differences in x - ray - optical properties(@xcite ) .",
    "for all the fits shown in figure  [ fig ] , @xmath40 .",
    "however , one can fit the spectrum with @xmath38 with proper choices of the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath37 and @xmath33 .",
    "this degeneracy arises due to the unavailability of uv spectral index since the present model predicts the corresponding particle spectral index as @xmath31 or @xmath53 ( equation ( [ eq : crspec1 ] ) and ( [ eq : crspec2 ] ) ) depending upon the above two conditions .",
    "future observations at these photon energies may help in validating the present model and also will remove this degeneracy . also , to obtain a precise values for @xmath49 and @xmath47 , spectral indices at radio - optical and x - ray energies",
    "should be known accurately . in general @xmath6 and @xmath11",
    "can be energy dependent and in such a situation the solution ( equation ( [ eq : arnum ] ) ) may differ from its form and the index beyond @xmath37 may not be the one discussed above .    using the present model we estimated the flux at gev - tev energies due to inverse compton scattering and",
    "are given in table 1 .",
    "for the inverse compton process the target photon can be either synchrotron photon(ssc ) or cosmic microwave background radiation(ic / cmbr ) or both . from the observed superluminal velocities of @xmath54 to @xmath55 and the viewing angle of @xmath56 to @xmath57 ( @xcite ) we found the synchrotron photon energy density dominates over the doppler boosted cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "hence the flux quoted in table 1 are due to ssc process and are below the sensitivity of the present gamma - ray telescopes _",
    "magic_(@xcite ) , _ hess _ and the upcoming experiment _ glast _ . hence discrimination of the models based on gev - tev observations as discussed in @xcite for @xmath58 can not be done for m87 jets .",
    "a possible scenario of the present model is where ar is a region around an internal shock following an external shock .",
    "the electron injection into ar can be the one which are already accelerated by an external shock and are advected downstream to be accelerated further by the internal shock ( @xcite ) .",
    "an internal shock description for the knots in agn jets has already been discussed in literature ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , reacceleration of power law electron distribution by turbulence at boundary shear layers can also be another possible scenario ( @xcite ) .",
    "inclusion of these scenario in its exact form into the present model will make it more complex and is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "@xcite proposed a modified ci model where the volume within which particle acceleration occurs is energy - dependent .",
    "this is expressed in terms of a filling factor _",
    "@xmath59 _ which is the ratio between the observed flux to the flux predicted by the simple ci model .",
    "they found _",
    "@xmath59 _ declining with increasing distance from the nucleus suggesting particle acceleration taking place in larger fraction of the jet volume in the inner jet than the outer jet .",
    "the energy dependence of _ @xmath59 _ also indicates that particle acceleration regions occupy a smaller fraction of jet volume at higher energies .",
    "even though the model is phenomenological , it indicates that the process of high energy emission from the knots are as complicated as their physical region .",
    "however the mechanism responsible for the filling factor is not explained .",
    "@xcite explained the knot hst-1 of m87 jet as a region when the reconfinement shock reaches the jet axis .",
    "they considered at the initial stage of m87 jet , the particles expand freely decreasing the pressure rapidly than the ambient gas pressure .",
    "this will develop ( in case of m87 ) a reconfinement shock which reaches the jet axis at a location which coincide with that of the knot hst-1 .",
    "they postulate this location as the beginning of hst-1 and while its outer parts are identified as stationary reflected shock formed when the reconfinement shock reaches the jet axis .",
    "also they evaluated the ambient radiation field along the jet axis and estimated the tev gamma - ray emission from hst-1 initiated by an outburst experienced at the core .",
    "since the reconfinement shock requires an initial free expansion , the knots downstream hst-1 can not be explained by this model .",
    "@xcite explained the flattening of non - thermal spectra in the ultraviolet and x - ray bands observed from the knots of m87 and 3c273 jets through diffusive synchrotron radiation(dsr ) in random small - scale magnetic fields . whereas the synchrotron spectrum from regular large - scale magnetic field dominates the spectra at low energy band .",
    "the dsr spectrum at high energy is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the observed photon frequency and @xmath62 is the spectral index of the random magnetic field assumed to be a power - law .",
    "@xcite proposed a filamentary jet model to explain the observed x - ray spectral index . in their model ,",
    "the jet comprises magnetic filaments of transverse size @xmath63 and particles trapped in this filaments are accelerated by diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "the acceleration of the electrons bound to a large filament are controlled by the radiative losses before escape from the filament . whereas the electrons trapped in smaller filaments escape via energization . a critical scale @xmath64 discriminates between the large and small scale filaments .",
    "they considered a situation where the magnetic field is larger for filaments with larger size and found the electron energy peaks when trapped in the filament of size @xmath64 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is explained by the synchrotron radiation of the electrons accelerated in the filaments of size @xmath65 .",
    "however , synchrotron radiation from large - scale magnetic field itself can reproduce the observed x - ray spectrum ( present model ) involving less number of parameters and/or assumptions(2 ) .",

    "they considered ar and cr are spatially separated and introduced a break in the particle spectrum injected in cr through the advection of particles from ar to cr .",
    "this along with the cooling break in cr produce a double broken power - law with indices @xmath29 , @xmath53 and @xmath66 which is then used to fit the observed spectra .",
