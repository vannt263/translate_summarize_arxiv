    "that long carbon chain radicals could be abundant and play a large role in interstellar chemistry was first recognized with the discoveries of c@xmath1n in the circumstellar envelope irc+10216 ( gulin & thaddeus 1977 ) and in the dark cloud tmc1 ( friberg et al .",
    "to date seven acetylenic chain radicals , c@xmath3h , @xmath4 , and five cyanopolyyne molecules , hc@xmath5cn , @xmath6 , are identified in tmc1 and/or irc+10216 ( bell et al .",
    "1997 , gulin et al .",
    "1997 ) . surprisingly , no cyanopolyyne radicals heavier than c@xmath1n were so far detected , despite model predictions that at least c@xmath0n should be abundant ( herbst et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the non - detection of c@xmath0n was first blamed on a small dipole moment and on the lack of spectroscopic data .",
    "the dipole moment @xmath7 and the rotation constant @xmath8 of the c - chains radicals depend critically on the nature of their electronic ground state .",
    "the two lowest states , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are close in energy ( pauzat et al .",
    "pauzat and co - workers predicted from unrestricted hartree - fock calculations that the @xmath9 state of c@xmath0n lay below the @xmath10 state and that @xmath7 was very small .",
    "the line strengths scaling with @xmath11 , it was no wonder that c@xmath0n escaped detection .",
    "things changed when botschwina ( 1996 ) showed from more elaborate coupled cluster calculations that the c@xmath0n ground state was in fact @xmath10 and that @xmath7 was as large as 3.385  d , even larger than the dipole moment of c@xmath1n .",
    "it then became clear that c@xmath0n could be detected at least in the laboratory .",
    "kasai et al .",
    "( 1997 ) succeeded to synthetize this species , to measure its microwave spectrum , and to derive its rotational , fine and hyperfine constants , making at last possible a sensitive search for c@xmath0n in space . in this letter , we report the astronomical detection of this radical .",
    "the long carbon - chain molecules and radicals are nearly thermalized in tmc1 and irc+10216 with rotation temperatures , @xmath12 , in the ranges 610 k and 2050 k , respectively . since , for c@xmath0n , @xmath13 k , the strongest lines in these two sources lie in the @xmath14 1 cm and @xmath15 mm atmospherical windows .",
    "we thus searched for c@xmath0n at these wavelengths , using the effelsberg 100-m telescope and the pico veleta 30-m telescope .",
    "the effelsberg observations were made in october 1997 , january and march 1998 .",
    "the telescope was equipped with the k - band maser receiver .",
    "the weather was mostly clear and the system temperature @xmath16 k. we used the new ak90 autocorrelator split into two 20mhz - wide bands of 4048 channels each .",
    "one of the bands covered both fine structure components of the @xmath17 transition of c@xmath0n ( 25.250 ghz , kasai et al .",
    "1997 ) , the other the @xmath18 transition of @xmath19 c@xmath20h ( 25.227 ghz ) .",
    "the local oscillator frequency was switched by @xmath21 khz or @xmath22 khz and the spectra folded accordingly .",
    "the average spectrum obtained in tmc1 at the position of the cyanopolyyne peak ( 1950.0 : @xmath23 ) , smoothed to 15 khz ( 0.17 kms@xmath24 ) , has a r.m.s .",
    "noise of 3.5 mk ( units of @xmath25 ) .",
    "in addition to c@xmath0n and c@xmath20h , we observed briefly the @xmath26 line of hc@xmath0n ( 23.96 ghz ) and the @xmath27 lines of c@xmath1n ( 19.79 ghz ) .",
    "all the data were calibrated following the procedure described by schilke & walmsley ( 1991 ) by observing at every frequency the planetary nebula ngc  7027 , whose flux was taken equal to 5.8 jy . the calibration uncertainty , which results mostly from the atmospheric absorption correction and from beam efficiency variations , is estimated to be @xmath28 .",
    "the hc@xmath0n and c@xmath1n line intensities we measure are consistent with those reported by tlle et al .",
    "( 1981 ) and gulin et al .",
    "( 1982 ) .",
    "figure  1 ( see also table  1 ) shows the spectrum covering the c@xmath0n transitions .",
    "we see two 0.3 kms@xmath24-wide spectral lines , each detected at @xmath29 .",
    "the lines are separated by @xmath30 mhz , which is very close to the value of the spin - rotation constant measured by kasai et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , @xmath31 mhz .",
    "their half - power width is comparable to the c@xmath1n linewidth , @xmath32 kms@xmath24 .",
    "their rest frequencies coincide within the small uncertainties with the c@xmath0n n=98 transition frequencies calculated by kasai et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , if we adopt the source lsr velocity of @xmath33 kms@xmath24 measured for c@xmath1n and c@xmath34h ( see gulin et al .  1982 ) .",
    "since there are no other comparable lines in the 20 mhz - wide spectrum we observed , the probability for a chance coincidence is @xmath35 .",
    "we thus conclude that we have detected c@xmath0n in tmc1 .",
    "the 30-m observations were made in nov .",
    "1997 and april 98 .",
    "the telescope was equipped with two sis mixer receivers with orthogonal polarizations .",
    "the zenith atmospheric opacity was below 0.1 and the system temperature @xmath36 k. the observations were made by wobbling in azimuth the secondary mirror at a rate of 0.5 hz and with an amplitude of 90@xmath37 .",
    "we searched for the n=3231 line , the next two lower lines being partly blended with lines of unrelated species .",
    "the average spectrum obtained toward irc+10216 is plotted in figure 2a .",
    "it has an r.m.s .",
    "noise per 1 mhz channel of 0.90 mk in the @xmath38 scale .",
    "the carbon - chain molecules observed in irc+10216 are concentrated in a thin shell of radius @xmath39 ( see fig.2b ) .",
    "observed with the 30-m telescope , the profiles of their @xmath40  3 mm lines have the same cusped shape and the same width ( 29.5 kms@xmath24 ) .",
    "they are all centred at @xmath41= -26.5 kms@xmath24 .",
    "the spectrum of fig .",
    "2a shows two cusped lines , near 89.75 ghz and three weaker features near 89.80 ghz .",
    "the former can be readily assigned to the @xmath42 and @xmath43 fine structure components of c@xmath1h in its first excited bending state , @xmath44 ( yamamoto et al .  1990 ) since they have the right frequencies and the right intensity ratio ( @xmath45 , whereas the expected lte ratio is 1.30 ) .",
    "we have fitted 3 cusped lines ( assuming standard line shapes and 29.5 kms@xmath24 widths ) to the 3 weak spectral features of fig .",
    "the derived intensities and rest frequencies are given in table 1 ; the fitted spectrum is compared in fig .  2c to the observed spectrum .",
    "the first two lines agree in frequency with the @xmath46 and @xmath47 transitions of c@xmath0n and very probably arise from this radical . indeed , although the @xmath40 3 mm spectrum of irc+10216 is more crowded than the 1 cm spectrum of tmc1 , there are not many lines that we can not assign to the rotational transition of a known circumstellar molecule : in our 30-m telescope spectral survey of irc+10216 , the density of unidentifed lines stronger than @xmath48 mk is only of 1 per 80 mhz ( see gulin et al .",
    "the probability that two unrelated lines lie within 1 mhz from the c@xmath0n lines is thus lower than 1 per one thousand .",
    "whereas the first two features can be tentatively assigned to c@xmath0n , the third , which is weaker and lies 7 mhz higher in frequency , remains unidentified .",

    "( 1990 ) for c@xmath1h , and gulin et al .",
    "( 1982 ) for c@xmath1n ( see also gottlieb et al . 1983 ) .",
    "the observed rest frequencies of c@xmath1n and c@xmath0n were derived assuming v@xmath50= 5.65 kms@xmath24 in tmc  1 and -26.5 kms@xmath24 in irc+10216 ; that of hc@xmath0n was derived assuming v@xmath50= 5.75 kms@xmath24 ( see gulin et al .",

    "uncertainty on the last digit .",
    "the uncertainties on the line integrated intensities , given in the table , do not include the calibration uncertainty which is @xmath51 .",
    "note that the intensity ratio between the rotational transitions in the c@xmath1h ground state and in the @xmath52 excited bending state , hence presumably the population ratio between these two states , is @xmath53 .",
    "in the direction of the tmc  1 cyanopolyyne peak , the rotational populations of hc@xmath0n and hc@xmath1n can be described by boltzmann distributions with rotation temperatures of @xmath54 k ( see e.g.  takano et al .",
    "we adopt therefore t@xmath55= 8 k. the h@xmath56 column density in this direction is n(h@xmath56)= @xmath57 @xmath58 ( cernicharo & gulin 1987 ) . that of c@xmath0n can be calculated from the standard expression for the optically thin lines of thermalized linear molecules :    @xmath59    where @xmath60    and where @xmath61 kkms@xmath24 is the sum of the integrated intensities of the two doublet components . in equation",

    "we calculate first the abundance of the @xmath66c isotopomers of hc@xmath0n , whose 1 cm lines are optically thin , by setting in equation [ 1 ] @xmath67 d , @xmath68 ghz and @xmath69 kkms@xmath24 , which is the average of the integrated intensities of the j=98 lines of hc@xmath66cc@xmath1n and hc@xmath70@xmath66cn , observed with the effelsberg telescope ( takano et al .",
    "we find n(hc@xmath70@xmath66cn)= 1.0 @xmath71 @xmath58 , from which we derive n(hc@xmath0n)= 7 10@xmath66 @xmath58 , adopting the ` standard ' elemental abundance ratio @xmath72c/@xmath66c@xmath7370 in the local interstellar medium ( see wilson & rood 1994 ) .",
    "the value of 7 10@xmath66@xmath58 is close to the value of suzuki et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , as well as to the value we estimate with an lvg code from the main isotopomer @xmath74 line intensity ( 5 10@xmath66@xmath58 ) .",
    "we arrive at :    n(hc@xmath70@xmath66cn / c@xmath0n)= 3 + n(hc@xmath0n / c@xmath0n)@xmath75 .    for c@xmath1n",
    ", we find , using in eq . [ 1 ] @xmath76k , @xmath77 d ( pauzat et al . 1991 ) , and the line parameters of table 1 : n(c@xmath1n)= 8.2 10@xmath72 @xmath58 .",
    "finally , we take for hc@xmath1n the column densities derived by takano et al .  ( 1998 ) , + n(hc@xmath66ccn)= 2.1 10@xmath72 @xmath58 and n(h@xmath72c@xmath1n)= 1.6 10@xmath78 @xmath58 .",
    "this yields :    n(hc@xmath66ccn / c@xmath1n)= 0.26 + n(h@xmath72c@xmath1n / c@xmath1n)= 19 .",
    "the c@xmath0n / hc@xmath0n abundance ratio is an order of magnitude smaller than the c@xmath1n / hc@xmath1n ratio . according to neutral - neutral gas phase chemical models ,",
    "the cyanopolyyne mole - cules are mainly formed by reactions of n and cn with polyacetylenes or polyacetylic ions ( herbst & leung 1990 ) .",
    "the cyanopolyyne radicals are formed in tmc1 by the reaction of atomic c with cyanopolyynes ( herbst et al .",
    "1994 ) , and in irc+10216 by photodissociation ( cherchneff & glassgold 1993 ) .",
    "they are destroyed by reactions with n atoms , o atoms , polyacetylenes and photodissociation .    according to model predictions",
    ", hc@xmath1n / hc@xmath0n varies in tmc1 by several orders of magnitude between the `` early times '' and steady state .",
    "the c@xmath1n / hc@xmath1n and c@xmath0n / hc@xmath0n ratios , on the other hand , remain constant within a factor of 2 .",
    "they are comprised between 0.1 and 0.2 ( see table 3 of herbst et al .",
    "1994 ) . whereas the observed c@xmath1n / hc@xmath1n ratio ( 0.2 , cernicharo et al .",
    "1987 ) agrees with the predicted one , c@xmath0n",
    "/ hc@xmath0n is more than one order of magnitude too low .",
    "the most recent models , which take into account the destruction of acetylene and polyacetylenes by c atoms and the reaction of cn with o , form enough c@xmath0n but too little c@xmath1n , hc@xmath1n and hc@xmath0n ( herbst et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in the case of irc+10216",
    ", we adopt for c@xmath0n the same rotation temperature as for hc@xmath0n ( @xmath12= 29 k , kawaguchi et al .",
    "we then derive from the integrated intensities of table 1 a line - of - sight column density in the direction of the central star ( twice the radial column density across the shell ) n(c@xmath0n)@xmath79 @xmath58 .",
    "this is @xmath80 times less than the column densities of c@xmath1n and hc@xmath0n . here also , c@xmath0n is underabundant with respect to model predictions ( cherchneff & glassgold 1993 ) , and c@xmath0n / hc@xmath0n one order of magnitude smaller than c@xmath1n / hc@xmath1n .",
    "the unexpectedly low c@xmath0n / hc@xmath0n abundance ratio in found both sources shows that the formation of long carbon - chain molecules is not fully understood , and that is difficult to predict the abundances of unobserved species .",
    "the very long carbon chains could be more abundant than expected .",
    "we note , however , that the species of medium size , such as the chains consisting of @xmath81 c , n , or o atoms and the rings with less than 10 heavy atoms , which would give rise in tmc  1 to a rich centimetric spectrum , are probably not very abundant in that source : we have covered so far a 100 mhz - wide band in tmc  1 with a very good sensitivity and did not detect any unidentified line down to a level of 10  mk .",
