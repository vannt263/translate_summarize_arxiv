    "the geometric increase in performance of computers over the last few decades , together with advances in applied physics and mathematics , has led to the birth of a new way of doing science that is in the intersection of theory as well as experiment .",
    "they are referred to as computational sciences and allow for computer experiments under perfectly controllable and reproducible conditions . in this way",
    "computer simulations have been very successful in explaining a large variety of physical phenomena and guiding experimental work .",
    "in addition it is even possible to predict new phenomena by conducting experiments _ in silico _ that otherwise would be too difficult , expensive , or simply impossible to perform .",
    "however , the by far most rewarding outcome of computer simulations is the invaluable insight they provide into the behavior and the dynamics of a system .",
    "the two most common algorithms for such studies are the monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite and molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite algorithm .",
    "the latter is simply the numerical solution of newton s equation of motion , which allows both equilibrium thermodynamic and dynamical properties of a system at finite temperature to be computed .",
    "since it also provides a window onto the atomic real - time evolution of the atoms , another role of md is that of a computational microscope .",
    "one of the most challenging , but very important aspects of md simulations is the calculation of the interatomic forces . in classical simulations",
    "they are computed from empirical potential functions , which have been parametrized to reproduce experimental or accurate _",
    "ab - initio _ data of small model systems . even though great strides in elaborating these empirical potentials have been made , often the transferablility to systems or regions of the phase diagram different from the ones to which they have been fitted is restricted .",
    "furthermore , they are not able to simulate with sufficient predictive power chemical bonding processes that take place in many relevant systems . eventually , some of the most important and interesting phenomena of modern physics and chemistry are intrinsically nonclassical .",
    "therefore , a first - principles based approach , such as _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) @xcite , where the forces are calculated on - the - fly from accurate electronic structure calculations , is very attractive since many of these limitations can in principle be removed .",
    "however , the increased accuracy and predictive power of aimd simulations comes at significant computational cost . for this reason ,",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite is to date the by far most commonly employed electronic structure theory , but it is important to note that aimd is a general concept that in principle can be used in conjunction with any electronic structure method .",
    "nevertheless , also the _ ab - initio _ approach is not without problems - the relevant energy scale is tiny , well below @xmath0 , and in particular the attainable length and time scales are still one of its major limitations .",
    "the mathematical task of md is to evaluate the expectation value @xmath1 of an arbitrary operator @xmath2 with respect to the boltzmann distribution @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the nuclear positions and momenta , while @xmath6 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the total energy function @xmath7 where the first term denotes the nuclear kinetic energy , @xmath8 the potential energy function , @xmath9 the number of nuclei and @xmath10 the corresponding masses .",
    "one way to to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ boltzmannequation ] ) , at least in principle , is to directly solve such a high dimensional integral , whose integrand is very sharply peaked in many dimensions , by an uniform sampling using the mc technique .",
    "however , such an algorithm is very inefficient , if it would not be for importance sampling @xcite , which satisfies the sufficient detailed balance condition by rejections .    alternatively , assuming the ergodicity hypothesis , the thermal average @xmath1",
    "can not only be determined as the ensemble average of a mc simulation , but using md , also as a temporal average @xmath11    however , by propagating the classical many - body system in time according to newton s equation of motion , the nuclei are treated only classical , an usually negligible approximation except for very light atoms or low temperature , where nuclear quantum effects may be important and a quantum formalism such as imaginary - time path integrals is required @xcite .",
    "similar to mc , within md some kind of importance sampling is naturally performed by preferentially visiting phase space of low potential energy .",
    "furthermore , as denoted by the additional time dependence in eq .",
    "( [ temporalaverage ] ) , md allows for additional insights from the nuclear real - time evolution , at least in an statistical average sense .",
    "it is neither the intention , nor possible , to obtain ` exact ' trajectories by md due to the infamous lyapunov instability , which states that slightly perturbed trajectories are intrinsically exponentially diverging with time .",
    "the equipartition theorem @xmath12 where the dot indicates time derivative , @xmath13 the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 the instantaneous temperature , offers an elegant way to bridge the gap between molecular mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "this opens the door to extract a vast variety of relevant static and dynamic , as well as transport properties from a md simulation .",
    "nevertheless , any computational resource is finite , which limits the time and length scales accessible by computer simulations .",
    "one way to partially bridge the gap between the microscopic size of the simulated system and the macroscopic reality is to introduce periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) . in this way",
    "surface effects are eliminated by effectively simulating an infinite system , albeit with a finite periodicity that is identical to the length @xmath15 of the simulation cell . as a consequence ,",
    "only phenomena whose characteristic correlation length is much smaller than @xmath15 can be simulated , unless a finite - size scaling is applicable @xcite . by similar means only processes whose typical relaxation time is significantly smaller than the simulation time @xmath16 can be studied . even though great strides have been made to extend the accessible time and length scales of aimd",
    ", it is apparent that techniques such as those reviewed here are clearly needed .",
    "in aimd the interatomic forces @xmath17 are determined on - the - fly using first principles electronic structure methods .",
    "that means that aimd is not relying on any adjustable parameter , but only on @xmath4 , which constitutes its predictive power .",
    "however , finding the antisymmetric ground state eigenfunctions @xmath18 of the corresponding many - body hamiltonian at each md step comes at a significant computational cost , which has to be carefully balanced against the size and sampling requirements of md .",
    "applying the so called born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite , which we have already implicitly assumed in the preceding section , @xmath8 can written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electronic many - body hamiltonian , that depend on the electronic coordinates @xmath21 and parametrically on @xmath4 .",
    "essentially , the born - oppenheimer approximation allows for a _ product ansatz _ of the total wavefunction consisting of the nuclear and electronic wavefunctions . due to the large separation of the nuclear and electronic masses ,",
    "the electrons can be expected to be in instantaneous equilibrium with the much heavier nuclei , so that the electronic subsystem can be treated independently at constant @xmath4 , hence the parametric dependence of @xmath20 .",
    "nevertheless , we are left with the formidable task to solve the electronic , nonrelativistic , time - independent , many - body schrdinger equation @xmath22 that is a high - dimensional eigenvalue problem , with eigenfunctions @xmath23 and eigenvalues @xmath24 , respectively .    to visualize the complexity of eq .",
    "( [ schroedingereq ] ) let us consider the following _ gedankenmodell _ to represent the solution @xmath23 on a real - space grid , where each coordinate is discretized by as less as 100 mesh points . ignoring spin and taking @xmath23 to be real , for @xmath25",
    "electrons @xmath26 grid points are required , so that the solution of a single si atom would require more grid points than the number of electrons in the whole universe , not to mention solving such a large non - linear eigenvalue problem .",
    "fortunately , this curse of dimensionality can be ingeniously bypassed by the use of dft , which is based on two celebrated papers of hohenberg , kohn and sham @xcite .",
    "the former , the so called hohenberg - kohn ( hk ) theorem , proves the existence of an one - to - one mapping between the ground state density @xmath27 and an external potential @xmath28 .",
    "since the electronic density @xmath29 depends on just 3 electronic degrees of freedom , it is in dft designated as the principal quantity instead of the more complex @xmath30-dimensional many - body wavefunction .",
    "hence , the nondegenerate ground state wavefunction @xmath31 $ ] and likewise @xmath32 $ ] are both unique functionals of @xmath27 , just as the ground state energy @xmath33 = { \\langle\\psi[\\rho_{0}(\\bm{r})]\\rvert\\mathcal{h}_{e}[\\rho_{0}(\\bm{r})]\\lvert\\psi[\\rho_{0}(\\bm{r})]\\rangle}$ ] .",
    "the latter obeys the variational property @xmath34 = { \\langle\\psi_{0}\\rvert\\mathcal{h}_{e}\\lvert\\psi_{0}\\rangle } \\leq { \\langle\\psi^{\\prime}\\rvert\\mathcal{h}_{e}\\lvert\\psi^{\\prime}\\rangle } = e^{\\text{dft}}[\\rho^{\\prime } ] ,    \\label{variationalproperty}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for which equality holds if and only if @xmath35 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ schroedingereq ] ) can not only be solved by iteratively diagonalizing @xmath36 $ ] within a self - consistent field ( scf ) procedure , but also by minimizing the quantum expectation value of @xmath36 $ ] , i.e. @xmath37 & = & \\min_{\\psi } { { \\langle\\psi\\rvert\\mathcal{h}_{e}\\lvert\\psi\\rangle } } = \\min_{\\rho } { { \\langle\\psi[\\rho]\\rvert\\mathcal{h}_{e}[\\rho]\\lvert\\psi[\\rho]\\rangle } } \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\min_{\\rho } { e^{\\text{dft}}[\\rho ] } .    \\label{constraintminimization}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in principle , the minimization has to be performed under the constraint that @xmath38 is @xmath9-representable , i.e. that it is arising from an antisymmetric n - body wavefunction @xmath39 .",
    "luckily , this had been solved , and it can be demonstrated that any single - particle density can be written in terms of an antisymmetric many - body wavefunction @xcite . on the contrary , for the @xmath40-representability problem , which states that @xmath38 is the ground state density of a local potential @xmath28 , no such general solution is known .",
    "the hk theorem just guarantees that there can not be more than one potential for each density , but does not exclude the possibility that there is no potential realizing that density .",
    "it is only known for discretized systems that every density is interacting ensemble @xmath40-representable .",
    "interestingly , the constructive proof of levy and lieb @xcite shows that for an arbitrary interacting system @xmath40-representability is not required for the proof of the hk theorem .    for the sake of simplicity , in the following i will throughout assume atomic units and confine myself to the physical relevant coulomb system , for which    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the proton number , @xmath43 the kinetic energy operator of the electrons , while @xmath44 is the electron - electron interaction and @xmath45 the electron - ion operator .",
    "the former two operators are universal and independent of the system , while the latter is system dependent , or nonuniversal .",
    "dft explicitly recognizes that it is indeed the potential @xmath28 , which distinguishes nonrelativistic coulomb systems and offers a prescription how to deal with @xmath43 and @xmath44 once and for all .",
    "therefore , even at this stage , using nothing but the hk theorem , dft is already of some practical use without having to solve the many - body schrdinger equation and without having to make a single - particle approximation by writing @xmath46 = t[\\rho(\\bm{r } ) ] + u[\\rho(\\bm{r } ) ] + v[\\rho(\\bm{r } ) ] ,     \\label{etf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 $ ] is the kinetic , @xmath48 $ ] the electron - electron and @xmath49 $ ] the electron - ion interaction energy as a functional of @xmath38 . in principle",
    "it should be even possible to calculate all observables , since the hk theorem guarantees that they are all functionals of @xmath38 .",
    "however , although the functional @xmath47 + u[\\rho(\\bm{r})]$ ] is universal for all systems of @xmath25 electrons , its explicit form is unfortunately unknown , so that physical sound and reliable approximations are indispensable .    in the so called thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation @xcite ,",
    "the full electron - electron interaction energy is approximated by the hartree energy @xmath50",
    "\\approx u_{\\text{h}}[\\rho(\\bm{r } ) ] = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int { d\\bm{r } \\ , \\int { d\\bm{r}^{\\prime } \\ , \\frac{\\rho(\\bm{r } ) \\rho(\\bm{r}^{\\prime})}{| \\bm{r } - \\bm{r}^{\\prime } | } } }    \\label{ehartree}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is the classical electrostatic interaction energy between the electron densities @xmath38 and @xmath51 .",

    "since that the explicit form of @xmath53 is only known for a homogeneous non - interacting system , @xmath53 is further estimated by the single - particle approximation @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 \\approx \\int { d\\bm{r } \\ , t_{s}^{hom}(\\rho(\\bm{r } ) ) } = t_{s}^{\\text{lda}}[\\rho(\\bm{r } ) ] ,       \\label{tfkine}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56    in the end the tf energy functional @xmath57 & = & t_{s}^{\\text{lda}}[\\rho(\\bm{r } ) ] + u_{\\text{h}}[\\rho(\\bm{r } ) ]   + v[\\rho(\\bm{r } ) ] \\nonumber \\\\    & \\approx & e^{\\text{dft}}[\\rho(\\bm{r } ) ]    \\label{tfenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] implies not only the single - particle approximation to the full electron - electron interaction , but also the single - particle mean - field approximation @xmath58 $ ] to the exact kinetic energy of the inhomogeneous interacting system . as a consequence , all many - body correlation effects are at this point neglected .    however , the hk theorem predicates that these many - body correlation effects are again a functional of @xmath38 and is known as the exchange and correlation ( xc ) functional .",
    "the addition of an approximation to the exact xc functional results in a formally exact theory , which is referred to as orbital - free dft @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to recognize , that the hk theorem is nothing but the formal exactification of the tf approximation .",
    "similarly , the kohn - sham ( ks ) @xcite scheme can be considered as the exactification of the self - consistent hartree equations ( he ) @xcite that differs from the tf approximation only in the kinetic energy , which is typically rather larger .",

    "therefore , similar to ehrenfest dynamics @xcite , the total derivative of the instantaneous , rather than the fully minimized , expectation value @xmath131 of the electronic hamiltonian yields the correct consistent forces .",
    "this implies that owing to the absence of necessity to fully minimize @xmath96 \\bigm| _ { \\ { { \\langle\\psi_{i}\\mid\\psi_{j}\\rangle } = \\delta_{ij } \\ } } $ ] , but rather to simply evaluate it for any give time step , @xmath132 is identical to zero by its very definition .",
    "provided that @xmath112 is small enough , the constant of motion is strictly conserved and the errors in the forces negligible , in particular if the ionic masses are renormalized by a constant mass tensor @xcite .",
    "as such , cpmd combines most of the advantages of bomd and ehrenfest md . in the latter , the electronic degrees of freedom",

    "( [ cplagrangian ] ) , in the second - generation cpmd method the improved coupled electron - ion dynamics is directly specified in terms of an predictor - corrector integrator scheme @xcite . since ,",
    "contrary to the evolution of the nuclei nuclei , accuracy is crucial for the short - term integration of the electronic degrees of freedom , a highly accurate yet efficient algorithm is essential . on this account",
    "we have selected the always stable predictor - corrector ( aspc ) method of kolafa @xcite , though other choices are equally possible @xcite .",

    "the modified predictor is followed by a corrector step to minimize the error and to further reduce the deviation from the instantaneous ground state . considering that this scheme was originally devised to deal with classical polarization , special attention",
    "must be paid that during the evolution the idempotency condition is always satisfied . because of that , the modified corrector @xmath147 + ( 1-\\omega ) \\mathbf{c}^{p}\\left ( t_{n}\\right ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \\mbox{where~}\\omega   & = & \\frac{k}{2k-1}~\\text{and}~k \\ge 2\\]]involves the evaluation of only a single preconditioned electronic gradient @xmath148 $ ] , using an idempotency conserving minimization technique , to calculate the electronic force .",
    "this predictor - corrector scheme leads to an electron dynamics that is accurate and time reversible up to @xmath149 , while @xmath150 is chosen to guarantee a stable relaxation towards the instantaneous ground state .",
    "alternatively , the predictor can also be repeatedly applied , in which case the ground state is even more closely approached , though at the cost of additional electronic force calculations . however , the efficiency of this method is such that the electronic ground state is very closely approached within just one preconditioned electronic gradient calculation per aimd step , so that in general this is not necessary .",
    "therefore , the second - generation cpmd method not only entirely avoids the scf cycle , but also the iterative wavefunction optimization , i.e. not even a single diagonalization step is required , while at the same time remaining very close to the bo surface and allowing for @xmath151 to be as large as in standard bomd .      given that the energy is invariant under a unitary transformation within the subspace of occupied orbitals @xmath135 , it must be ensured that this gauge transformation is not strongly changed by @xmath148 $ ] , as in this case continuity between the @xmath135 s may be lost .",
    "furthermore , the minimization scheme must be very efficient in bringing the electronic degrees of freedom as close as possible to the instantaneous ground state and at the same time preserves the idempotency condition of the density matrix . for these reasons , the orbital transformation ( ot )",
    "method has been chosen @xcite .",
    "inspired by the form of the exponential transformation an auxiliary variable @xmath152 is introduced , to parameterize the occupied orbitals @xmath153where @xmath154 and the variable @xmath152 has to obey the linear constraint @xmath155 . under this condition",
    ", @xmath156 leads to an idempotent density matrix for any choice of @xmath152 , provided that the reference orbitals @xmath157 are orthonormal .",
    "thus , any finite step along the preconditioned gradient direction will exactly fulfill the idempotency constraint by construction . because of the linear constraint the minimization with respect to @xmath152 is performed in an auxiliary tangent space . as this space is linear , no curved geodesics",
    "must be followed , as is the case for variables such as @xmath135 that are nonlinearly constrained . in this way",
    ", large minimization steps can be taken , especially if a good preconditioner is used @xcite .",
    "in fact , using an efficient , idempotency conserving direct minimizer such as ot is decisive for the success of this approach .",

    "this leads to an insignificant error in the forces , provided that @xmath168 is very close to the ground state .      despite the close proximity of the electronic degrees of freedom to the instantaneous ground - state ,",
