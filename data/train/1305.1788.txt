    "topological insulators ( tis ) have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years as a topologically protected quantum state of matter originating from straightforward bloch band theory .",
    "soon after the prediction of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum spin hall insulator,@xcite the 2d ti was realized in hgte quantum well heterostructures by knig _ _ et al.__@xcite characteristically , this quantum state of matter shows topologically protected spin currents running along the sample edges without net current flow .",
    "consequently , three - dimensional ( 3d ) varieties of this new form of insulator were predicted@xcite and again realized soon afterwards in bi@xmath7se@xmath8 ( ref .  ) and other compounds with strong spin - orbit coupling.@xcite    the defining property of strong 3d tis is the existence of a surface metal protected by the topology of the bulk bands in combination with time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "the surface is characterized by an odd number of band crossings which can be described by a 2d dirac equation .",
    "the surface metal shows a locking of momenta and spin degrees of freedom due to trs , leading to a helical dirac metal with vanishing backscattering and , most importantly , absence of electron localization .",
    "it is therefore robust with respect to surface disorder of arbitrary strength as long as trs is intact.@xcite    alternatively , 3d tis can be characterized by the so - called @xmath9 angle which takes the value @xmath10 for a strong ti , while @xmath11 for a weak ti or an ordinary band insulator . at the interface of a strong ti with vacuum ,",
    "axion electrodynamics predicts a quantized anomalous hall effect as a consequence of the varying @xmath9 term if the surface metal is gapped.@xcite this surface state has many interesting properties : for example , when an electric charge approaches such a surface , it creates a magnetic field which can be described by a mirror charge of a magnetic monopole that has instead of the electric charge a quantized magnetic charge.@xcite due to the topological protection , a necessary condition to create the gapped surface state is to break trs .",
    "while this can be achieved by an external magnetic field , this has the disadvantage that also trs is broken in the bulk which spoils the topological protection at least in the absence of inversion symmetry ( is).@xcite signatures of a quantized hall effect of such surfaces have been reported in hgte which lacks is.@xcite in ref .",
    "[ ] , we have shown that the hall response measured by contacting the edges remains quantized in such a system while , _",
    "e.g. _ , the monopole charge loses its quantization due to the breaking of trs in the bulk .",
    "it is therefore desirable to create tis , where trs is only broken on the surface .",
    "for example , it has been suggested@xcite to coat the surface with a ferromagnetic insulating layer which is technologically demanding .",
    "an alternative route is to search for tis , where trs is broken spontaneously on the surface , but not in the bulk , due to electron - electron interactions .",
    "indeed , it was shown that short - ranged electron - electron interactions may lead to a magnetic instability once a critical interaction strength is reached.@xcite within this paper , we will also follow the latter route .",
    "the basic idea is to increase the effect of interactions by reducing the fermi velocity of the surface bands . in particular , we investigate the fate of the surface bands when the bulk band gap , @xmath12 , is reduced .",
    "two qualitatively different scenarios are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : idea ] : in cases , where the surface fermi velocity remains large at the bulk quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xmath13 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : idea ]  ( a ) ] , one can in general not expect surface magnetism .",
    "a more interesting situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : idea ]  ( b ) , where the surface bands get increasingly flat upon approaching the bulk qcp .",
    "we will therefore investigate the following questions : under which conditions can one obtain small fermi velocities of surface bands when the bulk band gap is reduced ?",
    "how does screening develop in this limit ? and , finally , does the interplay of flat bands and screening lead to magnetism on the surface ?",
    "we will mainly study two model systems with flat surface bands and consider both the role of long - ranged coulomb and local interactions .",
    "the interplay of flat bands and strong interactions can lead to many different states of matter : most famously , variants of the fractional quantum hall effect can be induced in flat bands with non - zero chern number.@xcite our study focuses on a much simpler effect : the opening of a band gap at the dirac point due to ferromagnetism .",
    "our main results are as follows : ( 1 )  in the most general case , surface bands do _ not _",
    "become flat close to the bulk qcp .",
    "we identify , however , two cases where fermi velocities do become small : first , in the absence of is one naturally obtains situations , where the bulk band structure and level repulsion of bulk and surface bands leads to small fermi velocities .",
    "this is realized in model  i motivated by the properties of strained 3d hgte ( ref .  ) .",
    "second , in the presence of approximate chiral symmetries , almost flat surface bands are obtained for weak spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this mechanism is discussed for the fu - kane - mele model on a diamond lattice ( model  ii ) .",
    "( 2 )  concerning the effect of long - range interactions , the instability is controlled by the system - specific `` fine - structure constant '' @xmath0 ( @xmath14 denotes the surface fermi velocity ) which has to become large .",
    "while we can decrease @xmath5 considerably , we find that we can not do so without rendering @xmath15 large . in model  ii",
    ", @xmath16 remains constant in the limit @xmath17 with a value depending on microscopic details , but vanishes in model  i. as a consequence , we do not expect that the surface metal becomes critical and undergoes a surface instability due to long - range interactions .",
    "( 3 )  however , even when the long - ranged part of the coulomb interaction is well screened , the remaining short - range interactions can induce magnetism .",
    "here , we find that it is important whether the surface states remain confined to the boundaries of the system for @xmath17 . in model  ii ,",
    "the penetration depth of the surface state remains finite in the limit , where the fermi velocity at the surface vanishes , and thus a phase transition is induced at the surface . in contrast",
    ", the penetration depth in the model  i diverges and surface magnetism is not enforced in general .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : we start with a discussion of the generic idea underlying our study in sec .",
    "[ sec : idea ] , and review the mechanism of spontaneous ferromagnetism due to long - range interactions , a phenomenon related to chiral symmetry breaking in qed , in sec .",
    "[ sec : coulombinteractions ] . the same mechanism due to local coulomb repulsion is discussed in in sec .",
    "[ sec : hubbardinteractions ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hgtemodel ] , we turn to a concrete example for a system with flat surface bands motivated by strained 3d hgte , discussing the effects of both long - range and short - range interactions . afterwards , in sec .",
    "[ sec : diamondmodel ] , we discuss the fu - kane - mele model on the 3d diamond lattice as a system with flat bands which originate from the presence of an additional symmetry at the critical point .",
    "we conclude our discussions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we first discuss the possible mechanism of spontaneous ferromagnetism on the surface of tis , driven by long - range coulomb interactions ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : coulombinteractions ] ) or short - range hubbard - type interactions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hubbardinteractions ] ) .",
    "the general idea we are pursuing can best be understood from a minimal model for the surface metal of 3d tis which is a 2d dirac theory for a single cone : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the two - component dirac spinor , @xmath5 is the surface fermi velocity , while @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) denotes the usual pauli matrices . the effective surface hamiltonian  ( [ eq : surfacehamiltonian ] ) is gapless unless a term of the form @xmath22 is present which immediately opens a gap of size @xmath23 .",
    "such a mass term can be generated spontaneously by interactions corresponding to an order parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the microscopic symmetry associated with it depends on the physical meaning of the entries of the dirac spinors @xmath19 . on the surfaces of tis ,",
    "the spinor degrees of freedom are associated with the real spin due to the helical nature of the surface dirac fermions , implying that order corresponds to spontaneous ferromagnetism which breaks trs and opens a gap on the surface .",
    "once this gap is opened we expect to see , _ e.g. _ , the surface magneto - electric effects associated with tis , implying that there is an anomalous surface hall conductivity given by @xmath25.@xcite .",
    "note that in graphene the two components denote the sublattice degree of freedom , and thus order corresponds to a breaking of the sublattice is .",
    "often , the term `` chiral symmetry breaking '' is used to describe such phase transitions in models described by dirac equations . in the following , we discuss two interaction - driven mechanisms to generate this kind of term spontaneously .",
    "two - dimensional dirac fermions interacting via long - ranged coulomb interactions , @xmath26 with the fermion density operator @xmath27 , are unstable towards the breaking of chiral symmetry once the dimensionless effective fine - structure constant controlling the relative strength of coulomb interactions , @xmath28 exceeds a critical value @xmath29 ( refs .  ) . in the above expression , @xmath30 is the electron charge , @xmath15 the mean dielectric constant of the surrounding media , and @xmath5 denotes the fermi velocity of the surface dirac fermions .",
    "the critical interaction strength @xmath29 for chiral symmetry breaking remains finite as long as the number of fermion flavors does not exceed a critical number @xmath31 , where for @xmath32 the semimetal is always stable and long - range interactions can not trigger an instability . for graphene",
    "( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) this transition has been discussed intensively with the theoretical prediction for @xmath35 , depending on the approximation scheme@xcite .",
    "concerning eq .  , we observe that there are in principle two strategies of increasing the fine - structure constant @xmath16 by either decreasing the dielectric constant @xmath15 and/or reducing the surface fermi velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the first strategy has been pursued in the context of graphene : suspending the sample modifies the dielectric environment , and one expects a value of @xmath36 which , in principle , is well within the range of possible values for @xmath29 , but current experimental evidence does not support the existence of an excitonic insulator .",
    "for example , recent quantum oscillation measurements show semimetallic behavior down to lowest fillings and temperatures.@xcite    our basic idea is to pursue the second strategy , _",
    "i.e. _ , we try to decrease @xmath5 , hoping that the dielectric constant @xmath15 of the bulk material remains largely constant .",
    "however , we find that the latter is a strong restriction and usually can not be achieved in a generic setting .",
    "we show that , under certain circumstances , one can tune the fermi velocity @xmath5 by means of tuning the ti towards its bulk qcp , where it is converted into an ordinary band insulator .",
    "the appropriate knob is spin - orbit coupling which has been demonstrated via chemical substitution in bismuth - based compounds,@xcite but can in principle also be done in hgte systems , where hg is replaced by cd ( ref .  ) .",
    "similarly , one can discuss the effect of short - ranged interactions , where we consider the following model : @xmath37 in that situation , one can use a simple mean - field theory to obtain a crude estimate for the critical value of the interaction constant @xmath38 ( ref .  ) .",
    "starting from the dyson - schwinger equation for a dynamic mass term @xmath39 for a purely local interaction , one obtains the following mean field equation : @xmath40 this gives a stoner - type criterion for the relation between critical interaction strength @xmath41 and the fermi velocity @xmath5 reading as @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the ultraviolet momentum cutoff .",
    "this implies that upon reducing the velocity @xmath5 of the surface dirac fermions , the critical interaction strength @xmath41 is lowered , and thus this seems to be the promising way towards driving a ferromagnetic surface instability . a phase transition at the surface of a ti is therefore expected when the local interactions on the surface @xmath2 become larger than the surface bandwidth @xmath44 . as we will discuss below",
    ", it is , however , important to realize that the local surface interactions can become much weaker than the bulk interactions when the surface state wave function penetrates several layers into the bulk .",
    "overall , it appears therefore desirable to reduce the fermi velocity of the surface electron as much as possible to drive the quantum phase transition towards a gapped surface state .",
    "we first discuss a ti , whose effective model is inspired by the symmetries of strained 3d hgte .",
    "the topological surface states of strained 3d hgte can be described in terms of the @xmath45 electron ( @xmath46 ) bands and the @xmath47 light - hole ( @xmath48 ) bands .",
    "we neglect the coupling of the @xmath46 bands to the @xmath47 heavy - hole ( @xmath49 ) bands , because their presence only changes the quantitative features of the band structure , but does not alter the presence of the surface states as long as the strain - induced gap is open.@xcite therefore , limiting ourselves to the following four - dimensional set of basis states ( for details see ref .  ) , @xmath50 the @xmath51 bloch hamiltonian of the effective model can conveniently be expressed in terms of the identity , @xmath52 , five dirac matrices @xmath53 satisfying the clifford algebra @xmath54 , and their ten commutators @xmath55/(2i)$ ] . using @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 act on the orbital and spin degrees of freedom , respectively , and @xmath59 denotes the @xmath60 identity matrix , one obtains the following minimal model : @xmath61 \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum_{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{r } } } } \\psi^{\\dagger}_{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{r } } } } ( -\\mu\\ \\openone + m\\ \\gamma_{0 } + \\delta\\ \\gamma_{04 } ) \\psi^{{\\phantom{\\dagger}}}_{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{r}}}}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath62 is the overlap parameter describing hopping between nearest neighbors on a simple cubic lattice , and @xmath63 denotes the so - called tuning parameter .",
    "@xmath64 parametrizes the breaking of bulk is , and a finite chemical potential @xmath65 breaks particle - hole symmetry .",
    "following the theoretical scheme of quantum phase transitions of 3d tis by murakami,@xcite we can identify two types of criticality within model  i : ( a ) the bulk band gap closes at one of the time - reversal - invariant momenta ( trims ) , or ( b ) the bulk band gap closes away from any trim at several points in the brillouin zone . whether a system belongs to either of the two classes depends on the presence ( a ) or absence ( b ) of bulk is ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , in model  i ) .",
    "the general situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : idea ] .",
    "interestingly , only in case  ( a ) one finds a direct transition from the ti to the trivial band insulator , while in case  ( b ) there is generically an intermediate semi - metallic phase described by weyl fermions .",

    "these points start to move around in the brillouin zone until they meet a partner with which they can annihilate.@xcite this generic scenario can be modified if further symmetries are present ( see following ) .    in case",

    "( ii )  if we find lines of solutions in momentum space , then we are in an intermediate metallic phase . note that for a general @xmath80 those lines are again reduced to points , and both the critical point as well as the intermediate metallic phase are characterized by isolated dirac points .",
    "( iii )  we find isolated solutions to both equations describing a single dirac point .",
    "then , we are at the critical point from the metallic phase to one of the two adjacent insulating phases .    consequently , we can define three domains for the tuning parameter @xmath63 in the vicinity of the bulk phase transition : @xmath88 as ti , @xmath89 as trivial insulator , and @xmath90 as the intermediate metallic phase characterized by a number ( possibly a line ) of weyl points and a semimetallic density of states .    for the minimal hgte model  ( [ eq : minimalhgtemodel ] )",

    "due to level repulsion , the surface modes will have energies within the bulk band gap which enforces small velocities of the surface - state bands [ see fig .  [ fig : minimalhgtemodel ]  * ( b ) * ] .",
    "one can visualize this the following way : the bulk bands act as two `` stamps '' in energy space which have a distance of @xmath12 , and the surface bands therefore have to become flatter and flatter when @xmath12 shrinks .",
    "the `` spectral pressure '' of the bulk bands therefore leads to a flattening of the surface bands .",
