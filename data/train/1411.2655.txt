    "imaging using intensity - only ( or phaseless ) measurements is challenging because much information about the sought image is lost in the unrecorded phases .",
    "the problem of recovering an image from intensity - only measurements , known as the phase retrieval problem , arises in many situations in which it is difficult , or impossible , to measure and record the phases of the signals received at the detectors .",
    "this is the case , for example , in imaging from x - ray sources @xcite , or from optical sources @xcite , where one seeks to reconstruct an image from the spectral intensities .",
    "this problem arises in various fields , including crystallography , optical imaging , astronomy , and electron microscopy , and the images to be formed from intensity - only measurements vary from galaxies to microscopic objects .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem in active array imaging when the sensors only record the intensities of the signals .",
    "this can be the case because less expensive sensors are used , the data need to be collected faster , or because the phases are difficult to measure at the frequencies used for imaging . for frequencies above 10 ghz or so , it is difficult at present to record the phase of the scattered signals directly .",
    "there are at least two different approaches for imaging using intensity - only measurements . in the first approach",
    ", the phases are retrieved from the experimental set - up before doing the imaging .",
    "this is done , for example , in holographic based methods where an interferometer records the interference pattern between a reference signal and the analyzed signal @xcite .",
    "the interferometric image depends on the phase difference between the two signals and , hence , holds the desired phase information .",
    "an experimental strategy is also proposed for diffraction tomography in  @xcite , which requires measurements of the signal on two planes spaced at distances smaller than a wavelength .",
    "such techniques are , however , hard to implement in practice .",
    "the second approach carries out imaging directly , without previous estimation of the missing phases , using reconstruction algorithms .",
    "a frequently used method is based on alternating projection algorithms , proposed by gerschberg and saxton ( gs )  @xcite .",
    "this method uses two intensity measurements to form the   of pixels .",
    "this is so , because it requires the solution of a @xmath0 optimization problem with @xmath1 unknowns , instead of the original one with @xmath2 unknowns . in other words",
    ", it transforms the phase retrieval problem into one of recovering a rank - one matrix , which leads to very large optimization problems that are not feasible if the images are large . as a consequence ,",
    "it is desirable to have other approaches that guarantee convergence to the exact solution and , at the same time , keep the size of the problem small so the solution can be found more efficiently .",
    "it is important that any such approaches be robust to noise .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new strategy for imaging when only the intensities are recorded .",
    "this strategy has the desired properties mentioned above : exact recovery , robustness with respect to noise , and efficiency for large problems .",
    "we show that imaging of a small number of localized scatterers can be accomplished using the _ time reversal operator _ @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the full array response matrix of the imaging system .",
    "we show that the _ time reversal operator _ can be obtained from the total power recorded at the array using an appropriate illumination strategy and the polarization identity .",
    "once the _ time reversal operator _ has been obtained , we show that the location of the scatterers can be determined using its singular value decomposition ( svd ) .",
    "we consider two methods that make use of the svd of @xmath5 .",
    "the first method finds the locations of the scatterers from the perspective of sparse optimization , using a multiple measurement vector ( mmv ) approach .",
    "the second method finds the locations of the scatterers by beamforming .",
    "we use the music ( multiple signal classification ) method , which is equivalent to beamforming , using the significant singular vectors as illuminations .",
    "both methods recover the location of the scatterers exactly in the noise - free case and are robust with respect to additive noise .",
    "the imaging methods described here are efficient , do not need prior information about the object to be imaged , and guarantee exact recovery .",
    "we note , however , that recording all the intensities needed for the _ time reversal operator _ may not be possible .",
    "indeed , the number of illuminations involved is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of transducers in the array . in order to simplify the data acquisition process",
    ", we also propose two methods that reduce the number of illuminations needed for imaging .",
    "the first method selects pairs of transducers randomly , and finds the missing entries in the _ time reversal operator _ via matrix completion .",
    "this method reduces the number of illuminations to one half .",
    "the second method does not select the transducers randomly , but uses only a few transducers at the edges of the array .",
    "this method reduces the number of illuminations even more .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we formulate the active array imaging problem using intensity - only measurements . in section [ sec : timereversalop ] , we show how to obtain the _ time reversal operator _ when only the intensities of the signals are recorded at the array , and we discuss the relation of the _ time reversal operator _ with the full data matrix ( that also contains the information about the phases of the signals ) .",
    "we also discuss in section [ sec : timereversalop ] imaging with an incomplete set of illuminations , i.e. , when some entries of the _ time reversal operator _ are missing . in section",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we briefly review mmv and music methods , the two imaging methods used in the paper to form the images . in section [ sec : numerics ] , we show the results of numerical experiments .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in active array imaging we seek to locate the positions and reflectivities of a set of scatterers using the data recorded on an array @xmath8 . by an active array ,",
    "we mean a collection of @xmath7 transducers that emit spherical wave signals from positions @xmath9 and record the echoes with receivers at positions @xmath10 .",
    "the transducers are placed at distance @xmath11 between them , which is of the order of the wavelength @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the wave speed in the medium and @xmath14 is the frequency of the probing signal . in this paper , we focus on imaging of localized scatterers , which means that the scatterers are very small compared to the wavelength ( point - like scatterers ) . furthermore , for ease of exposition , we assume that multiple scattering between the scatterers is negligible . the imaging methods considered here can be implemented when multiple scattering is important too ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "let the active array with @xmath7 transducers at positions @xmath15 , @xmath16 , be located on the plane @xmath17 .",
    "assume that there are @xmath18 point - like scatterers in a image window ( iw ) , which is at a distance @xmath19 from the array .",
    "we discretize the iw using a uniform grid of @xmath20 points @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the scatterers have reflectivities @xmath23 , and are located at positions @xmath24 , which we assume coincide with one of these @xmath2 grid points . if the scatterers are far apart or the reflectivities are small , interaction between scatterers is weak and multiple scattering can be neglected .",
    "then , with the born approximation , the response at @xmath25 due to a narrow - band pulse of angular frequency @xmath14 sent from @xmath15 and reflected by the @xmath18 scatterers is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the green s function that characterizes wave propagation from @xmath28 to @xmath29 in a homogeneous medium .",
    "to write the data received on the array in a more compact form , we define the _ green s function vector _",
    "@xmath30 at location @xmath29 in iw as @xmath31^t\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 means the transpose .",
    "this vector can also be interpreted as the illumination vector of the array targeting the position @xmath29 .",
    "we also define the true _ reflectivity vector _",
    "@xmath33^t\\in\\mc^k$ ] such that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the classical kronecker delta . using and",
    ", we can write the response matrix as sum of outer products as follows , @xmath36_{r , s=1}^{n}=\\sum_{j=1}^m\\alpha_j\\vect\\wg_0(\\vect y_{n_j},\\omega)\\vect\\wg_0^t(\\vect y_{n_j},\\omega ) = \\sum_{j=1}^k\\rho_{0j}\\vect\\wg_0(\\vect y_{n_j},\\omega)\\vect\\wg_0^t(\\vect y_{n_j},\\omega).\\ ] ] using , we also define the @xmath37 sensing matrix @xmath38 as @xmath39 \\,,\\ ] ] and write in matrix form as @xmath40 we note that the full response matrix @xmath4 is symmetric due to lorentz reciprocity .    given an array imaging configuration ,",
    "all the information for imaging is contained in the full response matrix @xmath4 , including phases . in this case ,",
    "given a set of illuminations @xmath41 , the imaging problem is to determine the location and reflectivities of the scatterers from the data @xmath42 received on the array",
    ". the components of illumination vectors @xmath43^t$ ] in are the signals @xmath44 sent from each of the @xmath7 transducers in the array .",
    "if only the intensities of the signals are available , the imaging problem is to determine the location and reflectivities of the scatterers from the absolute value of each component in , i.e. , from the intensity vectors @xmath45 in , the superscript @xmath46 denotes conjugate transpose .",
    "this problem is , however , nonlinear and , therefore , there is much interest in finding algorithms that give the true global solution effectively .",
    "in this paper , we propose a novel imaging strategy for the case in which only data of the form is recorded and known .",
    "the main idea behind the approach proposed here is that we can use a related matrix to the full response matrix @xmath4 that has good properties for imaging and can be obtained from data of the form .",
    "this related matrix is the _ time reversal matrix _ @xmath3 . in this section",
    ", we will show first how to obtain it from the intensity vectors using the polarization identity , and how to use it for imaging using its singular value decomposition .",
    "the key point in active array imaging is that we control the illuminations that probe the medium and , therefore , we can design illumination strategies favorable for imaging . in our case",
    ", we seek an illumination strategy from which can obtain the _ time reversal matrix _",
    "@xmath3 from .",
    "suppose we can put any illumination @xmath47 on the array , but we can only measure quadratic measurements as in , i.e. , only the intensity of the data can be recorded . in that case , we also have access to the quadratic form @xmath48 indeed , @xmath49 note that only the _ total power _",
    "@xmath50 received at the array is involved in . in , @xmath51 is the intensity of the signal received at the i - th transducer .",
    "note that @xmath5 represents a self - adjoint transformation from the _ illumination space _",
    "@xmath52 to the _ illumination space _ @xmath52 .",
    "the entries of this @xmath53 square matrix can be obtained from the total power received at the array using multiple illuminations as follows .",
    "the i - th entry in the diagonal @xmath54 , @xmath55 , is just the total power received at the array when only the i - th transducer of the array fires a signal . in other words , @xmath56 , where the illumination vector @xmath57^t$ ] is the vector whose entries are all zero except the i - th entry which is @xmath58 .",
    "the off - diagonal terms @xmath59 , @xmath60 can be found from the polarization identity in the complex - valued inner product spaces .",
    "namely , using the polarization identity @xmath61 we obtain @xmath62 using the illumination vector @xmath63 , and @xmath64 using the illumination vector @xmath65 . in and , @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex number , respectively .",
    "again , only the total power received on the array is involved in these formulas .    from and it follows that we can recover all the entries in matrix @xmath5 by using the following illumination strategy . send in the illuminations @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "then , from the above elementary formulas we can determine the entries @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . following the same procedure for each pair of transducers @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the array we can determine all four entries @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "this means that if measure the total power received at the array from @xmath6 illuminations we can determine @xmath5 completely .      in the previous subsection we used the polarization identity to obtain the time reversal matrix @xmath5 using @xmath6 illuminations . in this case",
    ", all the entries of the matrix @xmath5 can be found . however , there are situations in which the data from some illuminations are corrupted and must be discarded . in this case , the matrix @xmath5 is not full , and the images have to be formed from an incomplete set of illuminations",
    ". we may model these situations by using randomly selected pairs of transducers , and recovering the entries of @xmath5 that can not be found from those illuminations by using matrix completion .",
    "this is possible because the data matrix @xmath5 is of low rank since the image is sparse .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath5 can be accomplished by minimizing its nuclear norm subject to agreement with its known entries . in more detail",
    ", we first recover @xmath5 by solving the optimization problem @xmath81 with the singular value thresholding algorithm @xcite , and then we apply the two imaging methods proposed in section  [ sec : methods ] to the reconstructed matrix @xmath82 . in , @xmath83 denotes the nuclear norm of a matrix , and @xmath84 denotes a random subset of @xmath5 . in @xcite , it was proven that most @xmath53 matrices of rank @xmath85 can be perfectly recovered from noiseless data by solving , provided that the cardinality of @xmath84 is greater than @xmath86 , for some constant @xmath87 .",
    "our numerical experiments in section [ sec : numerics ] show that we can recover the noiseless signal when no more than @xmath88 of entries of @xmath5 are missing .",
    "another interesting intensity - only imaging situation with an incomplete set of illuminations is when one has access to reliable data but wants to minimize their number . in this case",
    ", one can form the images from data obtained from a few good illuminations .",
    "the key point here is that the illumination done from the sources at the edges of the array are optimal in the sense that they carry most of the information needed for imaging  @xcite .",
    "note that , in this situation , the entries of the data matrix @xmath5 are not selected at random , and matrix completion can not be accomplished because many rows and columns of @xmath5 are unsampled . when the illumination is done using only a few sources at the edges of the array ,",
    "only the submatrices at the four corners of @xmath5 are known .",
    "our numerical experiments in section [ sec : numerics ] show that intensity - only imaging can be carried out with this partial knowledge of @xmath5 directly , that is , without matrix completion .",
    "furthermore , the numerical experiments show that if the data quality is good , i.e. , if the signal to noise ratio is high , the number of illuminations needed for imaging can be quite small .      in this section ,",
    "we describe how to use two well known imaging methods to obtain images from intensity measurements .",
    "we use an optimization - based method and a subspace projection method . in both methods , we exploit the fact that the svd of the _ time reversal matrix _",
    "@xmath3 is similar to the svd of the full data matrix @xmath4 , which also contains the information about the phases of the signals received at the array . indeed ,",
    "if we write the svd of @xmath4 in the form @xmath89 it follows from the definition of @xmath5 that the svd of @xmath5 is given by @xmath90 in these equations , @xmath91 are the nonzero singular values , and @xmath92 , @xmath93 are the corresponding left and right singular vectors , respectively .",
    "they fulfill the following equations : @xmath94 since @xmath4 is complex - valued but symmetric , @xmath95 for some unknown global phase @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "hence , it follows from that @xmath98 for an unknown global phase @xmath99 which is different for each singular vector @xmath93 .",
    "formula   implies that if the singular vector @xmath93 is the illumination used at the array , then the data on the array is known up to a global phase .",
    "this observation is the key point for the proposed optimization - based algorithm described in section [ sec : methods ] .",
    "subspace projection algorithms requires another observation .",
    "namely , the matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 have the same kernel . then",
    ", it immediately implies that subspace projection algorithms , e.g. music type algorithms , can be applied to find the locations of the scatterers if the matrix @xmath5 is known .    note that if @xmath100 has been obtained , then @xmath4 is the complex - valued symmetric matrix of the form @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is an unknown diagonal matrix with @xmath103 on the kth diagonal entry .",
    "thus , the problem of imaging from intensity - only measurements can be reduced to one in which the full data at the array is known , as it is explained next .",
    "robustness to noise of the proposed approach is a consequence of the central limit theorem , and the fact that we measure the total power   to construct the @xmath104 _ time - reversal matrix _ @xmath5 . indeed , suppose the noise at the i - th receiver is modeled by adding a random variable @xmath105 uniformly distributed on @xmath106 $ ] , where @xmath107 is the noiseless intensity received on the i - th receiver , and @xmath108 is a parameter that measures the noise strength .",
    "if we define the signal - to - noise ratio at the i - th receiver ( @xmath109 ) as the mean to standard deviation of the received power , then the @xmath109 on each receiver is the same , and is given by @xmath110 therefore , the signal - to - noise ratio for the total power is @xmath111 if the intensity does not vary too dramatically from one receiver to another . for example , it suffices to assume there exists @xmath112 so that @xmath113    it is straightforward to see that if the intensity at the i - th receiver is a random variable uniformly distributed on @xmath106 $ ] , then the noise in each entry of the time reversal matrix @xmath5 is a family of zero - mean , uncorrelated gaussian random variables with variance @xmath114 here , @xmath115 is the frobenius matrix norm , and the positive constant is given by @xmath116 hence , the larger the number of transducers @xmath7 in the array , the smaller the noise in the resulting _ time reversal matrix _ used for imaging .",
    "in this section , we describe the two imaging methods we use to form the images . at the beginning of each subsection",
    "we will assume that the full data matrix @xmath4 is recorded and known , i.e. , that the amplitudes and the phases of the signals received at the array are available for imaging .",
    "at the end of each subsection we show how these methods can be applied to the _ time reversal matrix _ @xmath5 .",
    "we now describe an optimization - based imaging method that exploits the sparsity of the scatterers in the iw .",
    "we will formulate active array imaging as a joint sparsity recovery problem where we seek an unknown matrix whose columns share the same support but possibly different nonzero values .",
    "this is known as the multiple measurement vector ( mmv ) approach that has been widely studied in passive source localization @xcite and active array imaging problems with non negligible multiple scattering @xcite with success .",
    "this method can recover the location and reflectivity of the scatterers exactly from full data in the noise - free case , and is robust with respect to noise ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "next , we briefly describe the mmv approach assuming that the full data matrix @xmath4 is known .",
    "assume that the number of scatterers @xmath18 is much smaller than the number of grid points @xmath2 , so @xmath117 .",
    "hence , the _ reflectivity vector _ @xmath118 , is sparse . from , the signal scattered back from the scatterers and received on the array is given by @xmath119 , where @xmath47 is the illumination sent from the array .",
    "then , we can define the linear operator @xmath120 that relates the _ reflectivity vector _",
    "@xmath121 with the received signals through the identity @xmath122 hence , @xmath123 is the @xmath37 matrix @xmath124 that depends on the illumination",
    ". in , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , are scalars that represent the field at @xmath21 due to the illumination @xmath47 sent from the array . with this notation , active array imaging with a single illumination",
    "amounts to solving for @xmath121 from the system of equations @xmath127 since the number of transducers @xmath128 in the iw , the system of equations is underdetermined and , therefore , there are many configurations of scatterers that match the data vector @xmath129 .",
    "however , due to the known sparsity of the reflectivity vector @xmath121 , one can use @xmath130 minimization @xmath131 to find the sparsest solution from noiseless data .",
    "it is well known that under certain conditions on the operator @xmath132 , and on the sparsity of @xmath121 , @xmath130 minimization is equivalent to @xmath133 minimization @xcite . when the data @xmath129 is contaminated by a noise vector @xmath134",
    ", then one can solve the relaxed problem @xmath135 for some given positive constant @xmath136 .",
    "the full data vector @xmath129 in - , which contains both the amplitudes and the phases of the collected signals , is obtained from a single illumination @xmath47 .",
    "when multiple illuminations are available , one could solve the @xmath130 minimization problem @xmath137 to capture the sparsity of @xmath121 .",
    "here , @xmath138 is the number of illuminations .",
    "this formulation , however , does not exploit the data structure optimally , as the solution vectors from different illuminations have the same support . to take advantage of the data structure , one can formulate the problem of array imaging with multiple illuminations as a joint sparse recovery problem , also known as the mmv formulation , aims to recover unknown sparse matrices with nonzero entries restricted to a small number of rows @xcite .",
    "we use this formulation for active array imaging in two steps as in @xcite . in the first step ,",
    "we determine the locations of the scatterers that are treated as equivalent sources .",
    "the equivalent sources have unknown locations but strengths related , in a known way , to the reflectivities of the scatterers and to the used illuminations . in the second step ,",
    "once the locations of the scatterers have been obtained , we recover the true reflectivities easily from these known relationships .      in the first step ,",
    "the sought matrix is the @xmath139 matrix @xmath140 $ ] whose @xmath141 column corresponds to the _ effective source vector _ @xmath142 whose components are given by @xmath143 under illumination @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "this matrix variable @xmath146 has columns that share the same sparse support but possibly have different nonzero values due to the different illuminations .",
    "the mmv formulation for active array imaging is to solve for @xmath147 from the matrix - matrix equation @xmath148 where @xmath38 is the @xmath37 sensing matrix , and @xmath149 $ ] is the @xmath150 data matrix whose columns are the full data vectors generated by the @xmath138 illuminations . in the mmv framework ,",
    "the sparsity of the matrix variable @xmath151 is characterized by the number of nonzero rows , i.e. , by the row - wise @xmath133 norm of @xmath151 .",
    "more precisely , we define the row - support of a given matrix @xmath151 by @xmath152 so the sparsity of @xmath151 is measured as @xmath153 . here , the @xmath154 row of @xmath151 is denoted by @xmath155 . with these definitions , the sparsest solution to",
    "is given by @xmath156 since is an np hard problem , we solve instead the convex relaxed problem @xmath157 with the @xmath158-norm function @xmath159 defined as @xmath160 the @xmath158-norm function is simply the @xmath161 norm of the vector formed by the @xmath162 norms of all the rows of a matrix .",
    "when the data is contaminated by additive noise vectors @xmath163 , @xmath145 , we solve @xmath164 for some pre - specified constant @xmath136 .",
    "formulations and have been studied thoroughly during the last few years , see for example @xcite . under certain conditions on the matrix @xmath165 and the sparsity of @xmath147 ,",
    "recovers the sparsest solution exactly if the data is noise - free .",
    "if the data is contaminated by additive noise , then recovers the sparsest solution upon a certain error bound .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "it follows from the discussion in section [ sec : timereversalop ] that the active array imaging problem with intensity - only measurements can be solved from the knowledge of @xmath5 using the mmv framework if the data is generated with illumination vectors equal to the right singular vectors of @xmath5 .",
    "more specifically , we can consider the mmv formulation   or   with @xmath166 $ ] being the matrix whose columns are the full data vectors generated by the illuminations @xmath93 ( up to a global phase ) , that is , @xmath167 . in   and  , @xmath168 $ ] is the unknown matrix whose @xmath141 column corresponds to the _ effective source vector _ defined in including a global phase @xmath169 .",
    "then , we can use   or   to find the locations of the effective sources .",
    "there are different algorithms for solving and .",
    "we use an extension of an iterative algorithm proposed in @xcite for matrix - vector equations .",
    "this method , called gelma , is a shrinkage - thresholding algorithm for solving @xmath130-minimization problems which has proven to be very efficient and whose solution does not depend on the regularization parameter that promotes sparse solutions , see @xcite for more details .",
    "we summarize it for mmv problems in algorithm  [ algo ] below .",
    "set @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and pick the step size @xmath172 and the regularization parameter @xmath173 .",
    "compute the residual @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176 , @xmath177 @xmath178      once we obtain from or the matrix @xmath179 whose columns are the effective sources corresponding to the different illuminations , we estimate the reflectivities easily by using .",
    "more precisely , for each component @xmath75 in the support of the solution given by or , we compute the estimated reflectivities @xmath180 corresponding to each illumination @xmath76 as @xmath181 we then take the average @xmath182 as the estimated reflectivity .",
    "we note that if the noise in the data is high , this last step can bring some ghosts to the final image because @xmath183 can be very small at some locations .",
    "nevertheless , this last step can be easily avoided by a further regularization as , for example , carrying on the division only at those pixels where @xmath184 is above a certain threshold .      the multiple signal classification method ( music )",
    "is a subspace projection algorithm that uses the svd of the full data array response matrix @xmath4 to form the images .",
    "it is a direct algorithm widely used to image the locations of @xmath185 point - like scatterers in a region of interest .",
    "once the locations are known , their reflectivities can be found from the recorded intensities using convex optimization as shown below .",
    "the search of the locations of the @xmath18 scatterers is the combinatorial part of the imaging problem and , hence , by far the most difficult task .",
    "note that @xmath4 is a linear transformation from the _ illumination space _",
    "@xmath52 to the _ data space _ @xmath52 .",
    "according to , the illumination space can be decomposed into the direct sum of a signal space , spanned by the principal singular vectors @xmath93 , @xmath186 , having non - zero singular values , and a noise space spanned by the singular vectors having zero singular values .",
    "since the singular vectors @xmath187 , @xmath188 , span the noise space , the probing vectors @xmath189 will be orthogonal to the noise space only when @xmath21 corresponds to a scatterer location @xmath190 .",
    "hence , it follows that the scatterer locations must correspond to the peaks of the functional @xmath191 we can interpret in terms of the images created by the singular vectors having zero singular value , as @xmath192 is the incident field at the search point @xmath193 due to a illumination vector @xmath187 on the array . according to this interpretation",
    ", the singular vectors having zero singular value do not illuminate the scatterers locations and , hence , has a peak when @xmath194 .",
    "since in our application the number of scatterers is small , the signal space is much smaller than the noise space and , therefore , it is more efficient to compute the equivalent functional @xmath195 with the projection onto the noise space defined as @xmath196 the numerator in is just a normalization .",
    "we note that is robust to noise , even for single frequency and for non - homogeneous , random media , and it is quite accurate for large arrays  @xcite .",
    "generalizations of music for multiple scattering and extended scatterers have also been developed ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is an immediate consequence of the discussion in subsection [ sec : sdv_tro ] that can also be used in the case in which the phases of the data are not recorded .",
    "both , @xmath5 and @xmath4 , share the same right singular vectors and , hence , can be applied , without any modification , to determine the location of the scatterers , once the _ time reversal matrix _ @xmath5 has been obtained .",
    "once the locations of the scatterers have been found from , we may want to estimate their reflectivities in a second step .",
    "this is still a nonlinear problem as only the intensities are available . to linearize the problem",
    "we follow the same approach proposed in @xcite , but restricted to the support of the solution found from .",
    "thus , we introduce the positive semidefinite matrix @xmath197 associated with the unknown reflectivities @xmath198^t\\in\\mc^l$ ] defined in the support @xmath199 recovered in the first step .",
    "note that now @xmath200 and , therefore , @xmath201 has small dimensions .",
    "following @xcite , we could obtain @xmath201 from intensity - only measurements by solving @xmath202 where @xmath203 is a linear map from @xmath204 to @xmath205 .",
    "an estimate for @xmath201 could be found , in principle , by solving by least squares .",
    "note , however , that @xmath201 is of low rank ( in fact rank @xmath58 since it is defined via an outer - product ) , so we obtain @xmath201 from the following affine rank minimization problem @xmath206 in order to take advantage of the additional information on the unknown @xmath207 . once @xmath207",
    "is found from this optimization problem , we can obtain the amplitude of the reflectivities by taking @xmath208 on the support @xmath199 .",
    "however , is an np - hard problem and , therefore , there is no simple algorithm that gives the true global solution effectively .",
    "therefore , we replace @xmath209 by the nuclear norm @xmath210 in the objective function of , and consider the following optimization problem as given in @xcite @xmath211 the nuclear norm @xmath212 is the sum of the singular values of the matrix while the rank is the number of nonzero singular values and , hence , it can be used as a convex surrogate for the rank functional @xcite .",
    "problem is now convex and can be solved in polynomial time .",
    "to solve , we follow  @xcite and use the gradient descent method with singular value thresholding , as outlined below in algorithm  [ algominimumlsqrank ] . in algorithm",
    "[ algominimumlsqrank ] , the soft - thresholding operation is given by @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the vector of positive singular values arranged in descending order , @xmath215 is the thresholding parameter , superscript @xmath216 means positive part , and @xmath217 and @xmath218 are the orthogonal matrices from the svd of @xmath219 .",
    "we stress that through step one , i.e. by using music to locate the scatterers , we have effectively reduce the dimension of the unknown @xmath220 in and , thus , the optimization problem is very easy to solve .",
    "set @xmath221 and @xmath222 , and pick the initial value for step size @xmath172 . compute weight @xmath223 .",
    "compute @xmath224 . compute the matrix @xmath225 .",
    "set @xmath226 .",
    "compute @xmath227 .    in algorithm  [ algominimumlsqrank ] ,",
    "the adjoint operator @xmath228 is given by @xmath229 which is found from the relation @xmath230 .",
    "we have seen in our numerical experiments that replacing the soft - thresholding operation by a rank @xmath58 enforcement , that is , setting @xmath231 at each iteration in algorithm  [ algominimumlsqrank ] , also gives excellent results .",
    "this can be understood as solving the least squares problem with the rank constrain @xmath232 this problem is , however , non - convex due to the non - convexity of the set of low - rank matrices and , therefore , it might not converge to the true solution in general .",
    "in this section we present numerical simulations in two dimensions .",
    "the linear array consists of @xmath233 transducers that are one wavelength @xmath234 apart .",
    "scatterers are placed within an iw of size @xmath235 which is at a distance @xmath236 from the linear array .",
    "the amplitudes of the reflectivities of the scatterers and their phases are set randomly in each realization .",
    "the scatterers are within an iw that is discretized using a uniform lattice with points separated by one wavelength @xmath234 .",
    "this results in a @xmath237 uniform mesh .",
    "hence , we have @xmath238 unknowns . in all the images shown below , we normalize the spatial units by the wavelength @xmath234 .    figure [ fig : nonoise ] shows the images obtained with music ( middle column ) and with the mmv formulation ( right column ) using noisless data .",
    "the top and bottom rows are two different configurations with @xmath239 and @xmath240 scatterers , respectively .",
    "the left column shows the distribution of scatterers to be recovered .",
    "when there is no noise in the data , both methods recover the positions and reflectivities of the scatterers exactly .",
    "the exact locations of the scatterers in these images are indicated with small white dots .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we give a novel approach to imaging localized scatterers from intensity - only measurements .",
    "the proposed approach relies on the evaluation of the _ time reversal matrix _ which , we show , can be obtained from the total power recorded at the array using an appropriate illumination strategy and the polarization identity .",
    "once the _ time reversal matrix _ is obtained , the imaging problem can be reduced to one in which the phases are known and , therefore , one can use phase - sensitive imaging methods to form the images .",
    "these methods are very efficient , do not need prior information about the desired image , and guarantee the exact solution in the noise - free case .",
    "furthermore , they are robust with respect to noise .    at the algorithmic level",
    ", a key property of the proposed approach is that it significantly reduces the computational complexity and storage consumption compared to convex approaches that replace the original vector problem by a matrix one @xcite and , therefore , create optimization problems of enormous sizes . with our approach ,",
    "the algorithms keep the original @xmath2 unknowns of the imaging problem , where @xmath2 is the number of pixels of the sought image , and hence , images of larger sizes can be formed .    as recording all the intensities that are needed for obtaining the _ time reversal matrix",
    "_ can be cumbersome , we also give two solutions that simplify the data acquisition process .",
    "they greatly reduce the number of illuminations needed for the proposed imaging strategy , but they increase the sensitivity to noise . we illustrated the performance of the proposed strategy with various numerical examples ."
