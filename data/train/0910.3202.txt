    "the effect of disorder on different types of condensed matter orderings is nowadays a subject of considerable interest @xcite . for the case of disordered magnetic systems ,",
    "random - field spin models have been systematically studied , not only for theoretical interests , but for some identifications with experimental realizations @xcite .",
    "an interesting issue , is the study of how quenched randomness destroys some types of criticalities .",
    "so , in what concerns the effect produced by random fields in low dimensions , it has been noticed @xcite that first - order transitions will be replaced by continuous transitions , so tricritical points and critical end points will be depressed in temperature , and a finite amount of disorder will suppresse them .",
    "nevertheless , in two dimensions , an infinitesimal amount of field randomness seems to destroy any first - order transition @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the simplest model exhibiting a tricritical phase diagram in the absence of randomness is the blume - capel model .",
    "the blume - capel model @xcite is a regular ising model for spin-1 used to model @xmath6 mixtures@xcite .",
    "the interesting feature is the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram represented in the plane temperature versus crystal field , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this phase diagram was firslty obtained in the mean - field approach , but the same qualitative properties were also observed in low dimensions .",
    "the latter was confirmed through some approximation techniques as well as by monte carlo simulations @xcite . also , the tricritical behavior is still held in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in other models this situation is controversial .",
    "for example , the random - field ising model in the mean - field approach @xcite also exhibits a tricritical point , but some monte carlo simulations @xcite in the cubic lattice suggest that this is only an artifact of the mean - field calculations . accordingly , this interesting fact in the blume - capel model motivated some authors to explore the richness of this model , within the mean - field approach , by introducing disorder in the crystal field @xcite as well as by adding and external random field @xcite . for the former case , it was obtained a variety of phase diagrams including different critical points with some similar topologies found for the random - field spin@xmath7 ising model @xcite . however , in those studies the fourth - order critical points , which limit the existence of tricritical points , were overlooked .",
    "consequently , our aim in this work is to improve those previous studies by considering a more general probability distribution function for the crystal field , and bettering some results given in references @xcite .",
    "the next section is dedicated to define the model and the special critical points produced by it .     within the mean - field approach , where @xmath8 is the boltzman constant , @xmath9 is the temperature , @xmath10 is the coupling constant between each pair of spins , and @xmath11 is the crystal field ( also called the anisotropy field ) .",
    "the black circle represents the tricritical point .",
    "the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases are represented by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the full line represents the continuous or second - order critical frontier , and the dotted line is for the first - order frontier.,height=207 ]",
    "the infinite - range - interaction blume - capel model is given by the following hamiltonian    @xmath14    where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the number of spins .",
    "the first sum runs over all distinct pairs of spins .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath17 is divided by @xmath16 in order to maintain the extensivity .",
    "the crystal fields are represented by quenched variables @xmath18 , obeying the probability distribution function ( pdf ) given by ,    @xmath19 + \\frac{(1-p)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi } \\,\\sigma } \\exp \\left [ - \\frac{{\\delta_{i}}^{2}}{2{\\sigma}^{2 } } \\right ] ~ , \\label{pdf}\\ ] ]    which consists of a superposition of two independent gaussian distributions with the same width @xmath1 , centered at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath22 , we recover the bimodal distribution studied in references @xcite , and for @xmath23 , the simple gaussian one of reference @xcite . for @xmath24 and @xmath23 , we go back to the simple blume - capel model without randomness@xcite .",
    "+ by standard procedures @xcite , we get the analytical expression for the free energy per spin ( @xmath25 ) , through which may be obtained a self - consistent equation for the magnetization @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we have the following relations at the equilibrium , @xmath27    @xmath28}^{-1 } \\right \\ } ~ , \\label{m}\\ ] ]    where the quenched average , represented by @xmath29 , is taken with respect to the pdf given in eq .",

    "( [ m ] ) in powers of @xmath26 ( landau s expansion , see @xcite ) . conveniently , we expand the magnetization up to seventh order in @xmath26 , so    @xmath31    where    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    and @xmath36    in order to obtain the continuous critical frontier one sets @xmath37 , provided that @xmath38 .",

    "+ the symbols used to represent the different critical lines and points @xcite are as follows :    * continuous or second - order critical frontier : continuous line ; * fist - order critical frontier : dotted line ; * tricritical point : located by a black circle ; * fourth - order critical point : located by an empty square ; * ordered critical point : located by an asterisk ; * critical end point : located by a black triangle .    to clarify ,",
    "we mean by a continuous critical frontier that which separates two distinct phases through which the order parameter changes continuously to pass from one phase to another , contrary to the case of the first - order transition , through which , the order parameter suffers a discontinuous change , so the two corresponding phases coexist at each critical point .",
    "a tricritical point is basically the point in which a continuous line terminates to give rise a first - order critical line . a fourth - order critical point",
    "is sometimes called a vestigial tricritical point , because it may be regarded as the last tricritical point .",
    "an ordered critical point is the point , inside an ordered region , where a first - order critical line ends , above which the order parameter passes smoothly from one ordered phase to the other .",
    "finally , a critical end point corresponds to the intersection of a continuous line that separates the paramagnetic from one of the ferromagnetic phases with a first- order line separating the paramagnetic and the other ferromagnetic phase . in following section",
    "we make use of this definitions .",
    "the distinct phase diagrams for the present model were numerically obtained by scanning the whole p - domain for each @xmath1-width .",
    "so , distinct topologies belonging to different @xmath4-ranges were found for a given @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , figure 2 shows the whole variety of them for a small @xmath49 , for each arbitrary representative @xmath4 .",
    "note that for small values of @xmath4 , one only ferromagnetic order appears at low temperatures , as shown in figure 2(a ) for @xmath50 . we designate it as topology i. figures 2(b ) and",
    "( c ) ( @xmath51 ) represent the same topology ( topology ii ) , which consists of one first - order critical line separating two different ferromagnetic phases @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and a continuous line remaining for @xmath54 .",
    "figure 2(c ) , though qualitatively the same as in 2(b ) , is intended to show how the first - order line and the continuous line approach themselves as @xmath4 increases .",
    "figure 2(d ) shows topology iii , for @xmath55 , so the preceding first - order line is now dividing the continuous line by two critical end points .",
    "note that the upper continuous line terminates , following a reentrant path , at a critical end point where the phases @xmath52 , @xmath56 , and @xmath13 coexist .",
    "so , at the lower critical end point , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath13 coexist . above the ordered critical point , the order parameter passes smoothly from @xmath52 to @xmath56 ( see the inset there ) .",
    "if we increase @xmath4 up to some @xmath57 , the upper continuous line and the first - order line will be met by a fourth - order point ( represented by a square ) as shown in figure 2(e ) .",
    "thus , @xmath58 is the threshold for topology iv .",
    "then , for @xmath59 , those lines will be met at a tricritical point , as noticed in figure 2(f ) .",
    "conversely , tricritical points appear for @xmath60 , so the last one for @xmath57 .",
    "the same types of phase diagrams are found in references @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we improve their results , not only bettering some of their numerical calculations , but in that we may now locate the regions of validity of these topologies in the plane @xmath61 . to this end , we start by locating the fourth - order points in the plane @xmath61 , as shown in figure 3 .    . note that if @xmath62 , we recover the bimodal case studied in references @xcite , where we found @xmath63 , just in agreement with them . note that if @xmath23 , @xmath64 , so it is a @xmath1-limit for the tricritical behavior .",
    "the dashed line is only a guide to the eyes.,height=226 ]    note that @xmath65 is a cut - off for the tricritical behavior .",
    "then , topology iv will no longer found for greater widths . on the other hand , we determine the threshold for topology iii , by estimating numerically which value of @xmath4 , for each @xmath66 , produces a situation like that presented in figure 4 ( case @xmath49 ) , where we see how topology iii emerges for a @xmath4 slightly greater than @xmath67 . for @xmath68",
    ", we found this threshold for @xmath69 , which is smaller than that obtained in reference @xcite .",
    "there , the authors suggested that topology iii disappears for @xmath70 .",
    "however , figure 5 illustrates that this type of phase diagram is still present even for a smaller @xmath4 , as confirmed by the free energy evaluated at three disctinct ( @xmath71)-points along the first - order critical line , at which there are three types of coexistences , namely , @xmath52 with @xmath56 , @xmath52 with @xmath13 , and @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "we also noted another discrepancy with respect to a critical @xmath66 , found in reference @xcite , above which topology iii disappears for @xmath23 .",
    "there , the authors affirmed that if @xmath72 , the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition becomes second order at all temperatures , but we noticed that it only happens for a greater width , namely , @xmath73 . + in order to obtain the frontier which separates topologies i and ii ( in the plane @xmath61 ) , we have to find the corresponding @xmath4 , for a given @xmath66 , that locates the one ordered critical point at @xmath74 . to this end , the next subsection is focused on zero temperature calculations .      in order to perform zero temperature calculations we make use of the equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "consequently , for @xmath75 ( see reference @xcite ) , there are two ferromagnetic phases @xmath52 and @xmath53 coexisting at @xmath76 , having magnetizations @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "we observed that these relations still remain up to some finite @xmath1 , after which a @xmath1-dependency emerges .",
    "so , for a greater width called @xmath79 , the ordered critical point ( that of topology iii ) must be found at @xmath74 . then , the first - order critical line is supressed and one only ferromagnetic order exists for any @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , if we choose @xmath80 , we find @xmath81 , as illustrated in figure 6 . there , the zero temperature free energy versus the order parameter is plotted for three different values of @xmath66 , at the point where @xmath82 and @xmath83 coexist .",
    "thus , in ( a ) , two minima are at the same level for @xmath84 . in ( b ) , it still happens for @xmath85 . nonetheless , in ( c ) , for @xmath86 , the ordered critical point is already at @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , for this particular @xmath4 , there is only one ferromagnetic phase for @xmath87 .",
    "for completeness , figure 7(a ) shows what figure 6(c ) illustrates by means of the free energy .",
    "there , it is shown where the ordered critical point is located , that is , at @xmath74 . in figure 7(b ) , we see the line composed by the @xmath88-points .",
    "this line separates phase diagrams containing two and one ferromagnetic phases .",
    "particularly , for @xmath23 , @xmath89 , as obtained in reference @xcite and confirmed numerically by us . + we summarize the preceding analysis by showing , in figure 8 , the regions of validity for the four qualitatively distinct phase diagrams .",
    "note that along the horizontal axis ( @xmath68 ) , regions ii and iii are separated by @xmath69 , and regions iii and iv by @xmath90 .",
    "along the vertical axis ( at @xmath23 ) , regions iv and iii are separated by @xmath65 , regions iii and ii by @xmath73 , then , regions ii and i by @xmath91 . furthermore , the line separating topologies i and ii is the same as in figure 7(b ) .",
    "the frontier separating topologies ii and iii consists of points estimated by the analysis illustrated by figure 4 .",
    "finally , the line between topologies iii and iv is made of fourth - order critical points , i.e. , it is based upon the points in figure 3 .     versus @xmath4 , associated with the topologies for the present model ( see also figure 2 ) .",
    "the horizontal and the vertical axes represent the probability @xmath4 , and the width @xmath1 , respectively ( see eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) ) .",
    "the tricritical behavior belongs to the region iv .",
    "the simplest topology belongs to region i , where only one ferromagnetic phase appears , whereas the rest topologies contain two ferromagnetic orders at low temperatures.,height=264 ]",

    "for @xmath24 , we recover the bimodal case studied in references @xcite , and for @xmath23 , the gaussian case studied in reference @xcite . for @xmath1-widths in @xmath92 ,",
    "the system exhibits four distinct topologies according to the range in which @xmath4 belongs .",

    ". topology i contains one continuous critical line separating a ferromagnetic phase to the paramagnetic phase . in topology ii",
    ", one first - order critical line separating two ferromagnetic phases is added .",
    "this line terminates at an ordered critical point .",
    "the most complex criticality belongs to topology iii , where the first - order line now divides the continuous critical line by two critical end points . in topology iv ,",
    "the first - order line and the continuous line are met by a tricritical point .",
    "accordingly , topology i presents one ferromagnetic phase , whereas the rest ones show two distinct ferromagnetic orders at low temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "the tricritical behavior manifested in topology iv emerges for @xmath60 , where @xmath58 denotes the probability for a given @xmath66 , where a fourth - order critical point is found .",
    "this point may be regarded as the last tricritical point vanishing for @xmath93 , since @xmath64 leads to @xmath94 .",
    "consequently , the tricritical behavior is no longer found for any @xmath4 .",
