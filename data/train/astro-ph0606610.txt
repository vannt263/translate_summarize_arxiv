    "mhd turbulence in the presence of a mean magnetic field , with or without density and gravitational gradients , plays a role in many environments , ranging from stellar coronae and winds @xcite to the interstellar medium @xcite and accretion disks . in such regions ,",
    "energy may be transferred , accumulated and dissipated in a way which is inherently anisotropic @xcite .",
    "in particular , in solar coronal physics , where one of the main problems is to understand how the corona can be sustained at more than a million of degrees , it is believed that the necessary heating could be produced at small scales generated by a non - linear cascade along a turbulent spectrum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as flux tubes ( in the form of coronal loops or coronal funnels ) are omnipresent , the anisotropy coming from the dominant magnetic field may be a central feature of the processes governing energy dissipation , like the non - linear collisions of counter - propagating alfvn wave packets .",
    "it can thus be expected that solving the coronal heating problem , understanding how the temperature of the corona can be sustained , may require to understand the details of the turbulent dynamics of mhd in these environments .    one way to study and",
    "the dynamics of such system is to perform direct numerical simulations ( dns ) . in the case of anisotropic mhd ,",
    "dns have provided insight on subjects like the anisotropy of the spectra @xcite , the parametric decay of alfvn waves @xcite , and alfvn waves filamentation @xcite .",
    "mhd simulations are also used to study the topology of magnetic field lines and magnetic reconnection in the corona @xcite .",
    "but the reynolds numbers attained in all the dns up to now are below @xmath4 , while they are believed to be @xmath5 to @xmath6 in the corona .",
    "dns are very far from being able to represent all the scales of turbulence in the corona , there is a huge gap to fill .",
    "furthermore , as statistics are of great help in the study of turbulence , attempts have been made to analyze statistically energy dissipations produced by dns .",
    "distributions of events are for instance presented in @xcite and @xcite from 2d dns of reduced mhd .",
    "but it is still difficult to get significant statistics from 3d dns , and it is even more difficult when trying to go to higher reynolds numbers because then the grid resolution must be higher and the computations of the model are too slow .",
    "for all these reasons , there is a need for simplified numerical models of mhd , which would run sufficiently fast to get statistics of turbulence at high reynolds numbers , while keeping the most relevant features of mhd turbulence .",
    "several approaches have been used to build such simplified numerical models of mhd .",
    "for example , the self - organized criticality behavior ( soc ) of mhd systems can be modeled by cellular automata ( ca ) , where the interactions of individual cells translate into a global statistic behavior of the whole system , following the first models of @xcite .",
    "however , the need for physical realism is not entirely addressed by the cellular automata , despite efforts trying to include the constraints issued from the mhd equations @xcite .",
    "another approach is to simplify the non - linear interactions by reducing the number of modes which are allowed to interact non - linearly . in the coronal loop context",
    ", a shell - model approach has been used by @xcite .",
    "we have developed a similar numerical model independently , starting from the reduced mhd equations but allowing for the stratification of the plasma .",
    "this numerical code , nicknamed shell - atm , allows one to reach ( kinetic and magnetic ) reynolds numbers unachieved before . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the problem of a coronal loop where energy is forced into the system by footpoint motions , describing in detail the dynamics of the heating events , turbulence spectra , statistics and scaling laws .",
    "we start from an approximation to incompressible mhd known as reduced mhd ( rmhd : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is valid when the plasma @xmath7 parameter ( kinetic over magnetic pressure ) is low , the domain has a large aspect ratio ( @xmath8 ) and the poloidal field is small compared to a strong axial external @xmath0  magnetic field ( @xmath9 ) . in this approximation",
    "the largest extension @xmath10 of the domain defines the parallel direction , or @xmath11-axis ; the velocity field is only composed of fluctuations @xmath12 orthogonal to the @xmath11-axis ; the magnetic field can be decomposed into @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the average magnetic field , parallel to the @xmath11-axis , and @xmath15 is a perpendicular fluctuation . throughout , we will normalize the magnetic fields by @xmath16 , considering for the moment a medium with uniform density @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the equations of rmhd become : @xmath20    as one can see in these equations , the non - linear dynamics occurs only in the planes perpendicular to the mean field @xmath0  while alfvn waves propagate along the mean field .",
    "direct simulations of these equations in one plane @xcite or in a 3d box @xcite have been carried out but the reynolds numbers obtained with such simulations are much too low to get a realistic inertial range of turbulence and long - term statistics .",
    "it is therefore our interest to simplify this model further by reducing the dynamics in the planes .",
    "this can be done by using shell - models , as described below .    the plasma of the solar corona and solar wind is stratified , so that one must allow for gradients of the mass density @xmath21 even while considering incompressible couplings .",
    "stratification couples incompressible alfvn waves by introducing variations in alfvn speed and therefore reflection ( as well as amplification / depression of amplitudes due to the conservation of energy flux ) .",
    "such terms may be written more clearly in terms of the the elssser variables @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) , in which case the effect of stratification on the linear propagation of modes may be written as @xcite : @xmath24    the first two terms describe the wave propagation , the third term the reflection of the waves by the perpendicular gradient of the alfvn speed ( which vanishes for a non - diverging flux tube ) , the fourth term describes the growth or decrease in the normalized wave amplitude due to variations in alfvn speed  assuring conservation of wave energy flux  as well as the isotropic part of the reflection .",
    "we will incorporate these terms in the general framework of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rmhd1]-[eq : rmhd3 ] ) , but first we discuss how the non - linear couplings are modeled in the shell approximation .      in shell - models of incompressible mhd turbulence @xcite ,",

    "this one - dimensional model is the magnetohydrodynamic analog of the goy ( gledzer - ohkitani - yamada : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shell - model of fluid turbulence .",
    "one obtains the following equation , given in @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the elssser - like variables , @xmath37 are combinations of kinematic viscosity and resistivity , @xmath38 are external driving forces , and @xmath39 is the non - linear term , obtained by assuming ( 1 ) that the non - linear interactions occur in triads of neighboring modes and ( 2 ) the conservations of the total pseudo - energies @xmath40 ( and thus the energy @xmath41 and the cross - helicity @xmath42 ) and a third invariant @xmath43 which depends on the dimensionality of the mhd system to model @xcite .",
    "the `` classical '' goy - like shell - model that we have just presented corresponds to mhd , where the average magnetic field @xmath0  has not yet been separated out ; in the shell - atm  model we present now in this paper , the average magnetic field @xmath0  is separated out , by starting from the rmhd equations ( [ eq : rmhd1]-[eq : rmhd3 ] ) .",
    "the new model we obtain corresponds basically to a pile of planes coupled by alfvn waves and containing each a `` classical '' shell - model for 2d mhd ( fig .",

    "the time variations of the dissipation power at these times scales ( corresponding to a few minutes of physical time ) seem to be almost the same on all positions along the loop .",

[",
    "fig : events ] for the event total energy content , the peak power of energy dissipation , the duration of events , and the waiting - time between two successive events .",
    "the distribution of the peak power in events is narrow , as a result of the summation of the heating function over the whole loop : the local spikes of energy dissipation are hidden by the average dissipation occurring in the whole loop . on the other hand the distributions of integrated dissipation power ( total energy content of events ) and of event durations are very wide .",
    "this is partially due to the threshold definition used @xcite , in the case of this time series where long time scales are superimposed to the shorter time scales of energy dissipation in the dissipation range .",
    "furthermore , the waiting - times between successive events have also a wide power - law distribution .",
    "however , as discussed extensively in @xcite , this result depends on what definition of an event is used to extract events from the time series of the power of energy dissipation .",
    "compared to the distributions of events obtained from the loop shell - model of @xcite , the main difference is the much steeper slope ( @xmath203 instead of @xmath204 ) of the distribution of the peak power in events",
    ". the reason could be the summation effect due to the existence of more but smaller dissipation events along the loop , because of the higher resolution we used in this run , both along the loop ( @xmath205 instead of @xmath206 , allowed by the parallelization of our code ) and in the perpendicular direction ( @xmath148 instead of @xmath207 ) .",
    "the time series of the kinetic and magnetic energies reveal oscillations corresponding to exchange of energy between the velocity and magnetic field .",
    "these exchanges occur , for example , thanks to the crossing of @xmath190 and @xmath191 wavepackets , and should have periods which vary depending on the precise number and repartition of wavepackets along the loop .",
    "a characteristic time scale is of course given by the alfvn crossing time @xmath101 , corresponding to the first resonance frequency @xmath208 .",
    "multiples of the alfvn crossing time correspond to higher - frequency resonances of a loop in linear theory . while the power spectrum of the time series of total energy is a power - law of index @xmath209 over more than @xmath210 decades , the spectra of magnetic or kinetic energy display peaks corresponding to these resonances . the spectrum of the time series of kinetic energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tspec ] ) fits to a power - law of index @xmath211 at very low frequencies .",
    "the first resonant frequency , together with the higher frequency harmonics , appear as peaks overlying a different , steeper power - law for the higher frequencies , shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tspec ] .",
    "the frequencies of the peaks correspond well with the integer multiples @xmath212 of the fundamental for @xmath213 , while at lower frequencies they appear shifted .",
    "this shift , which is absent in a linear simulation ( realized with the same parameters but without shell - models , with no non - linear interactions ) , is probably due to anharmonicity introduced by the non - linear effects , as shown by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "an even better understanding of these oscillations may be gleaned from a time - frequency analysis via wavelet transform shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wspec ] : there are oscillations which have long but finite lifetimes and different frequencies dominantly around the fundamental harmonic .",
    "these oscillating high - frequency wavepackets appear to arise in association with dissipation bursts , seen in the dissipation power time - series ( bottom panel of fig .",

    "the comparison between the spectra of the forcing function at a boundary and of the resulting energy time series ( top panel of fig .",

    "the correlation time of the dissipation power time series is shorter , but still longer than the wave crossing time , as an effect of the weakness of the intermittent non - linear interactions between counter - propagation wavepackets and of the global long - term fluctuations of the spectrum ( including the dissipation range ) noted in sect .",
    "[ sec : spfluct ] .      a common goal when studying solar flares and",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "with this heating model we can use the cross - correlations between time series to investigate which time series react first , and what kind of observations would be helpful when predicting flares . we have extended the study of @xcite , who show that in some events the kinetic energy begins to grow just before the start of a dissipation event , by doing a systematic correlation study between all energy and dissipation time series ( kinetic , magnetic and total ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ccorr ] shows the cross - correlations between the dissipation @xmath216 and the energy @xmath217 time series , as well as between the dissipation @xmath216 and the kinetic energy @xmath218 time series and @xmath219 . ] .",
    "both cross - correlation functions show delays of the dissipations compared to the energy : the dissipation lags of approximately 5 time units compared to the total energy , and of approximately 0.5 time units compared to the kinetic energy ( this last result is a confirmation of the result obtained in @xcite ) .",
    "thus diagnostics methods based on the total energy or including the magnetic fields measurements may provide more useful results for space weather prediction than methods based on the velocity field alone .",
    "however , in both cases the delays involved are short , of the order of a minute at best .      using the same runs as in sect.[sec : mken ] ( a set of loop with different aspect ratios for a fixed width ) , we compute the average energy dissipation in a stationary state , and we plot it versus the aspect ratio ( fig .  [",
    "fig : arde ] ) : the scaling of the energy dissipation power per unit volume is approximately in @xmath220 .",
    "this scaling can be compared to the different models listed in @xcite and corresponds to heating of mhd in 2 dimensions .",
    "as the slope of this power - law scaling is steeper than @xmath221 , shorter loops are more efficient in dissipation power per unit surface .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that alfvn wavepackets that reflect on the loop footpoints interact more frequently in a short loop than in a long loop ; as a matter of fact , simulations done when varying the alfvn speed show that the average dissipation power also increases when the alfvn speed increases .",
    "assuming that the physical units of the model ( see sect.[sec : scales ] are @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath84 , yielding @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , we get dissipation powers per unit surface between @xmath227 for large aspect ratios and @xmath228 for small aspect ratios",
    ". these values would be sufficient to heat the quiet corona @xcite .",
    "note however that they also depend on the physical properties @xmath110 and @xmath17 that we have assumed for the loop .",
    "another series of runs has been performed to explore the influence of @xmath110 on the heating , and it gives @xmath229 ; this translates the fact that wavepackets interact more frequently when the alfvn speed is higher , leading to more dissipation .",
    "these both fits , combined with a dimensional analysis on the variables @xmath230 ( dissipation power per unit surface ) , @xmath17 ( mass density ) , @xmath110 ( alfvn speed ) , @xmath132 ( forcing speed ) and @xmath184 ( aspect ratio ) , give : @xmath231 for the dissipation power per unit surface in s.i .",

    "although the model is simple and includes only simplified physical processes , it has a very interesting complex non - linear dynamics and it is fast enough to get statistics of its fields and of the heating it produces : the simplifications we made allow to explore other properties than those accessible to classical direct numerical simulations ( dns ) . while it is not meant to replace and can not replace dns , for example because of the lack of three - dimensional information on field - line topologies , it partially fills the huge gap between the reynolds numbers in dns and in the real corona : although reynolds numbers reached in the model , of the order of @xmath164 , are still lower than the ones expected in the corona , this already represents an outstanding progress compared to dns .",
    "furthermore this allows to explore regimes of mhd turbulence that are not accessible to dns , for instance this allows for intermittency to appear in turbulence while having a complete description of the spectra and of the non - linear interactions in the perpendicular direction . on the other hand ,",
    "having even higher reynolds numbers , and thus smallest scales , may require to take into account non - mhd effects , like kinetic effects , that can still be neglected in this model .",
    "the model has been used in this paper in the case of a magnetic loop in the solar corona , in which the physical properties of the medium ( namely the external longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0  and the mass density ) are assumed to be uniform along the loop . in this case , and thanks to the above - mentioned characteristics of the model , we could show that this model loop displays : a dynamics over a very wide range of spatial and temporal scales ( 4 to 5 orders of magnitude ) ; spectra which are formed by a local cross - scale energy flux , and which have a wide inertial range in either direction , perpendicular or parallel to the external magnetic field ; a clear anisotropy between the parallel and perpendicular spectra , which could be compatible with the `` critical balance '' phenomenology ; a scaling of the average ratio of the magnetic energy over the kinetic energy consistent with rmhd ; a heating function with multiple spatial and temporal scales ; a flat longitudinal profile of the average dissipation power ( although this may be dismissed by further simulations , with non - uniform physical properties of the medium along the loop ) ; a spiky , and statistically intermittent time series of energy dissipation power ; power - law distributions of the characteristics ( peak energy , total energy , duration , waiting - times ) of `` events '' extracted from the time series of dissipation power ; finite - lifetime packets of resonant frequencies in the time series of energy , but whose frequencies are shifted from the harmonics of the linear resonant frequencies because of the non - linearities ; long - range time correlations in time series ; a delay of the dissipation time series compared to some energy time series ; an average dissipation power that scales with the loop parameters , and that could be sufficient to sustain the high coronal temperatures . as discussed in the text , some of these results confirm or complete the results of a similar model @xcite .",
    "further directions for the study of the solar corona using this model include taking advantage of the possibility of modelling non - uniform regions to ( 1 ) allow for density gradients in a coronal loop , to seek for the preferred locations of coronal heating , and ( 2 ) study a magnetically open region such as a coronal hole . in order to get diagnostics that can be compared to observations",
