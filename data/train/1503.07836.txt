    "the flare - up of an x - ray transient typically signals a rapid increase in the rate of accretion onto a compact object , a white dwarf ( wd ) , neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) , and provides an ideal laboratory for studying astrophysics in a relativistic regime .",
    "even though transients have been studied for many years , our understanding of the processes behind extreme accretion events remains relatively poor .",
    "the term x - ray transients cover a wide range of different system phenomenology , but is typically used to mean low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) and high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) systems containing bh and ns secondaries .",
    "however , it may also refer to a wide range of transient x - ray phenomena including millisecond pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ) , magnetar outbursts ( e.g. @xcite ) , stellar flares ( e.g. @xcite ) and many others",
    ".    the process of accretion that drives most x - ray astrophysical phenomena can often be dramatic and short lived , with increase in accretion rates causing x - ray flux rises of up to 6 orders of magnitude , in the case of supergiant fast x - ray transients ( @xcite and references therein ) , from quiescent levels . in many cases these events lead to the discovery of previously unknown systems , or systems that were previously considered uninteresting .",
    "these transient events are rare and often short lived , making detection and detailed study difficult .",
    "other transients outbursts may be from sources that were previously known outbursts , but have not been seen for many years , for example bh transient outbursts are known to be recurrent , but the time between outbursts has been reported to be as long as 60 years @xcite . to obtain a good rate of detection of transient outbursts , x - ray instruments that cover very large areas of the sky are required .",
    "however , wide field and all - sky instruments , such as _ fermi _ gbm @xcite , _ maxi _ @xcite , _ integral _ isgri @xcite and _ rxte _ asm @xcite , typically lack the spatial resolution required to provide accurate localizations necessary for further optical and ir observations , and typically do not have enough sensitivity for a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the outburst .",
    "nasa s _ swift _  mission @xcite was designed to localize bright x - ray transient events , in this case gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "its three instruments , the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) and uv / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) , provide a unique complement of instruments to discover and follow - up gamma - ray bursts .",
    "this combined with a spacecraft that provides very rapid and accurate slewing to a target , allows for reporting of gamma - ray burst positions within minutes of them being detected .    the same capabilities that make _ swift _  so successful at finding grbs ,",
    "are equally as well tuned for discovery and localization of bright x - ray transients .",
    "in addition the rapid slewing capabilities of _ swift _  allows for low - overhead short ( @xmath1ks ) observations to be taken , allowing for long - term sensitive monitoring of outbursts to be performed .",
    "no other operating mission is capable of high cadence monitoring outbursts in this manner .",
    "in this paper i will explore _ swift _ s ability to detect , localize and follow - up x - ray transients in the milky way and the large and small magellanic clouds , as both a stand - alone telescope and in concert with other x - ray / gamma - ray wide field detectors utilizing the _ swift _  target of opportunity ( too ) program .",
    "_ swift _  performs observations of new x - ray transients utilizing triggers from both the bat and from other wide field x - ray and gamma - ray observatories . in this section",
    "i will describe the various methods of detection and follow - up that are commonly used to enable x - ray transient science with _",
    "the bat covers approximately 1.4 steradian of the sky at any one time , and due to _ swift _ s diverse observing strategy , both caused by the large number of targets observed in a typical day , and by the need observe at least 3 targets per 96 minute orbit in order to avoid looking too close to the earth , bat on average covers 80@xmath090% of the sky daily @xcite .",
    "such near all - sky coverage means that it is excellent at detecting new x - ray transients that emit in the 15 - 150 kev bat energy range .",
    "when bat detects a bright unknown transient , it triggers the _ swift_``automated target '' ( at ) response , which is the same response for grbs : the bat localization of the transient , with an error of typically @xmath2arc - minutes , is telemetered to the ground through the tracking and data relay satellite system ( tdrss ) , and if possible _ swift _  will slew to the coordinates of the transient , and begin follow - up observations with the uvot and xrt instruments .",
    "all _ swift _  tdrss telemetered products are distributed through the gamma - ray coordinates network ( gcn ; @xcite ) , enabling community follow - up of newly discovered transients .",
    "when observations begin , the xrt takes a series of short images of the field ( @xmath3s and @xmath4s long ) and attempts to locate the transient utilizing an onboard centroiding algorithm .",
    "if the transient is bright enough to be detected in this exposure , this location will be telemetered to the ground through tdrss within minutes of the initial detection .",
    "xrt will perform observations in auto state , where the ccd will be read out in either in windowed timing ( wt ) or photon counting ( pc ) mode based on the brightness of the new transient ( for a description of xrt modes see @xcite . if pc mode data is taken , event data are telemetered to the ground through tdrss for the first orbit , and event reconstruction and astrometric correction , utilizing uvot data ( e.g. @xcite ) , allows for a position to be determined with accuracies up to 1.5 arc - seconds radius , with xrt data alone allowing an accuracy of up to 3.5 arc - seconds radius ( all errors quoted at 90% confidence ) .",
    "uvot also takes observations of the field and telemeters these through tdrss , allowing for a rapid localization of any optical counterparts of the transient within minutes of detection ( see for example , figure  [ uvot ] ) .",
    "bat triggered response allows for very rapid reporting of the location of a new x - ray transient to the community , typically within seconds of detection through gcn alerts , and approximately 10 - 25 minutes through gcn circulars .",
    "in addition for x - ray transients , the _ swift _  team will issue a report on the coordinates , along with a preliminary spectral analysis to the astronomers telegram website ( atel ) , which is the most common way of reporting new transients in the x - ray transient community .",
    "in addition to transients detected by the bat triggering algorithm , the the _ swift_/bat hard x - ray transient monitor @xcite is a software based transient monitor that utilizes bat data taken during normal observations .",
    "the bat transient monitor has a sensitivity of approximately 5.3 mcrab in a day , allowing for the monitoring of many bright known sources , as well as the detection of new transients .",
    "the primary benefit is the ability to detect sources down to a much fainter level than needed to trigger bat ( 100@xmath0200 mcrab , d. palmer , _ private communication _ ) , meaning slow - rising transients can be detected much earlier than with bat itself .",
    "the _ swift_/bat hard x - ray transient monitor web site contains light curves for over 1000 sources , with approximately 250 of these being detected on a daily basis . since february 2005",
    "it has discovered @xmath5 new x - ray transients .",
    "an example of an light - curve of an x - ray transient discovered by the bat transient monitor , _ swift _",
    "j1753.7 - 2544 @xcite , is shown in figure  [ battrans ] .    when a new transient is discovered using this method , observations are triggered through the _",
    "swift _  target of opportunity ( too ) program , and follow - up typically consists of a short pc mode observation in order to localize the source , follow - up by observations in wt in order to characterize the spectrum and timing nature of the source .",
    "results of these observations are reported by the _ swift _",
    "team by atel .",
    "typically these are sent out within days of the source rising above the detection limit of bat .",
    "in addition to triggers from bat , _ swift _  performs observations of the new transients detected by other missions , e.g. _ integral _ @xcite and fermi / lat @xcite , through the _ swift _  target of opportunity program .",
    "the _ swift _  too program is open to the astronomical community via the _ swift _  mission operations center ( moc ) website , and enjoys a high degree of popularity , for example , in 2014 951 too requests were submitted .",
    "_ swift _  toos can be submitted with a variety of priority levels , which relate to how quickly observations should be performed .",
    "priority 1 ( within 4 hours ) and priority 2 ( within 24 hours ) when submitted will alert the",
    "_ swift _  observatory duty scientist ( ods ) via mobile phone text message , at which point they will begin evaluating the feasibility of the requested observations .",
    "priority 3 ( days to a week ) and priority 4 ( weeks to a month ) , alert the ods via email .",
    "all too requests require approval of the _ swift _  principle investigator and/or their deputy before execution .",
    "_ swift _  has the capability of performing automated too observations through ground commanding .",
    "given the target s coordinates , a requested exposure time and priority level , _ swift _  will automatically determine the target visibility and observe the target for the requested amount of time , interleaving observations between targets in the current observing plan based on the prioirty .",
    "these too commands can be uploaded to the spacecraft utilizing either tdrss or ground station commanding .",
    "tdrss commanding requires manual intervention of the _ swift _  flight operations team ( fot ) , so is typically only available during working hours , although in some high priority cases , fot members will be called into the _ swift _  moc to perform out - of - hours commanding .",
    "a customized scheduling system developed by the _ swift _  science operations team ( sot ) allows for too commanding to be scheduled for a future ground station pass at any time of the day , allowing for out - of - hours too commanding without the need to call in fot members .",
    "_ swift _  typically has  10 ground station passes per day , meaning that it can be on - target of any too request typically within a few hours at any time of the day .",
    "in addition to single - observation toos , _ swift _  may observe multiple locations in order to cover a larger error region than allowable in a single pointing .",
    "there are two ways in which this can be achieved : by utilizing multiple too uploads of differing coordinates in order to cover a large error box ; and by utilizing the bat tiling script , which allows for automated tiling of circular error regions .",
    "the former technique is typically used only for imaging extremely elongated error regions , such as those from the interplanetary network ( ipn ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the bat tiling script allows for tiling of regions utilizing a 4- or 7-point tiling pattern .",
    "an example of the 7-point tiling pattern can be seen in figure  [ tiling ] .",
    "the 7-point tiling guarantees coverage of an error circle up to 0.4 degrees radius at @xmath6 coverage , and @xmath7 coverage of a radius of 0.5 degrees .",
    "the benefit of this method is that as the slews between the individual tiles are very small , they can be performed quickly and with a low overhead , often allowing for imaging of the entire error circle in a single _ swift _  orbit . given that galactic x - ray transients are typically bright , observations consisting of seven tiles of 200 seconds exposure each are common .",
    "this greatly enhances the ability of _ swift _  to localize transients , even with larger error boxes .",
    "as the bat tiling script can be executed through the regular too commanding , it places no additional burden on the ods and sot , unlike the manual tiling of error boxes , which would require many more too commands to be organized .",
    "although bat is very capable at detection of an x - ray transient outburst , it s energy range ( 15 - 150 kev ) means that is tuned for detection of transients with relatively hard spectra .",
    "this tends to favor bh transients over ns transients , that often have spectra that break above 10 kev . in order to increase the number of x - ray transient detections by _ swift _ , the _ swift _  team partnered with the team of jaxa s _ `` monitor of the all - sky x - ray image '' _ telescope ( maxi",
    "; e.g. @xcite ) , which is part of the japanese experiment module on the international space station .",
    "maxi is a scanning telescope consisting of two instruments , the gas slit camera ( gsc ; @xcite ) and solid - state slit camera ( ssc ; @xcite ) .",
    "both maxi instruments are one - dimensional coded mask slit instruments , and scan majority of the sky every 86 minute iss orbit .",
    "maxi provides a powerful tool for the discovery of new x - ray transients , collecting an x - ray image of the sky in the 0.5 - 20 kev energy band , with sensitivities as low as @xmath8mcrab ( 5 sigma ) in a single orbit and @xmath9mcrab in a day .",
    "new transient discoveries are reported by the maxi nova alert system @xcite via email communication .    for sources that are relatively stable",
    ", maxi can localize a point source with an error of approximately 12 arc - minutes radius ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "this matches well the field of view of xrt ( @xmath10 arc - minutes radius ) , meaning that typically maxi error circles can be covered with a single pointing of xrt .",
    "given that maxi transients are typically @xmath11mcrab in brightness , detection by xrt is assured in an a short ( 500 - 1000s ) exposure , as xrt s sensitivity equates to approximately 1 xrt count / s / mcrab .",
    "fainter and/or temporally variable maxi transients may have larger error circles , which require tiling observations to be performed .",
    "the _ swift _  and maxi teams have set up a collaboration that , through the _ swift _  guest investigators program , follow - up the detection of all new maxi detected transients with _ swift _",
    "too observations in order to confirm and accurately localize the new transient .",
    "these observations are then typically followed by monitoring observations of this new transient to track it s entire outburst .",
    "here i report on the results of _ swift _  observations two x - ray transients .",
    "firstly i cover maxi  j1659@xmath0152 , a black hole lmxb in the galactic halo which was discovered by _",
    "swift_. secondly i cover _ swift",
    "_  observations of igr  j00569@xmath07226   ( also known as sxp 5.05 ) , which was discovered by _ integral _ , but which _ swift _  observations allowed the discovery of both eclipses , and measurement of the orbital parameters utilizing doppler shifts in the pulsar period .",
    "maxi  j1659@xmath0152 , a bh lmxb system , was first reported after detection by bat at 08:05 ut , september 25 , 2010 .",
    "follow up observations performed by the xrt and uvot 31 minutes later localized the transient @xcite , although it was initially misidentified as a grb and named grb 100925a .",
    "however the grb identification was disproved when a maxi detection @xmath12hours before the bat trigger , confirmed that maxi  j1659@xmath0152   was actually a previously unknown galactic x - ray transient @xcite .",
    "uvot identified a bright ( @xmath13 ) candidate inside of the xrt error circle , this counterpart did not correspond with any known catalog object .",
    "the non - detection of the companion in the usno - b catalog allowed an upper limit to be placed on the optical brightness of maxi  j1659@xmath0152   in quiescence of @xmath14 @xcite , suggesting that the optical counterpart brightened during outburst by @xmath15 magnitudes .",
    "following the detection by _ swift _  and maxi , a campaign of observations with a variety of observatories worked to identify the object .",
    "ir spectroscopy confirmed that the optical counterpart showed emission lines consistent with that of an x - ray binary @xcite .",
    "the transient was also detected in radio @xcite , by _ integral _",
    "@xcite , _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite and rxte .",
    "rxte detected a 1.6 hz type - c qpo in the power - spectrum , which indicated that maxi  j1659@xmath0152   was a bhb @xcite .",
    "a 2.41 hour periodicity , first reported by @xcite from _ xmm - newton _  data , and confirmed by @xcite from _ rxte _ made maxi  j1659@xmath0152   the the shortest period bhb yet known .",
    "the source of the periodicity was found to be irregular dips lasting between @xmath16min , with no detecting eclipses @xcite .    as a result of",
    "the initial _ swift _  trigger , and interest in the source , _ swift _  began a series of daily observations of maxi  j1659@xmath0152 , covering the first 27 days of it s outburst , after which the source became too close to the sun for _ swift _  to observe .",
    "results of the _ swift _  monitoring can be seen in figure  [ maxij1659 ] , which shows initial outburst light curve of maxi  j1659@xmath0152   as seen by bat , xrt and uvot .",
    "bat s triggering and _ swift _",
    "s automated slewing capability has allowed us to see a uniquely detailed and sensitive view of the early part of the outburst of a bh lmxb transient . as can be seen in the hardness xrt ratio plot",
    ", there is considerable spectral variability seen in the initial 3 - 4 days of the outburst .",
    "the uvot counterpart showed variability over all ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) bands , correlated with the rise with the x - ray light - curve , peaking with a brightness of @xmath23 .    by combining xrt and bat spectra , it was possible to track the spectral states of maxi  j1659@xmath0152  ( see figure  [ spectralfit ] .",
    "bhb are known to go through a series of canonical spectral states ( e.g. see @xcite ) , which typically can be defined as the relative combination and strengths of emission from a thermal disk component , and a comptonized power - law component . in the early part of the outburst ,",
    "maxi  j1659@xmath0152   is dominated by a hard power - law component ( @xmath24 ) , which quickly steepens ( @xmath25 ) . during the early part of the outburst , the addition of a significant but small thermal component appears , and grows hotter , indicating presence of an increasing hot disk component , which inner disk temperature rises from @xmath26 to @xmath27  kev .",
    "however , unlike many other bhbs , maxi  j1659@xmath0152   never fully transistions into a fully disk dominated thermal state , remaining instead in an intermediate state , with the disk never contributing to more than @xmath28 of the total emission in the 0.5 - 10 kev xrt energy band .    given the estimated distance to maxi  j1659@xmath0152   of @xmath29  kpc @xcite , and the height above the galactic plane ( @xmath30 ) , the source lies @xmath31  kpc above the galactic plane , suggesting that , similar to other bh binaries such as xte j1118 + 480 @xcite , it is a run - away microquasar that has been kicked out of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "in fact , maxi  j1659@xmath0152  appears to belong to a sub - class of short - period galactic bh lmxbs , along with xte  j1118@xmath32480 , gro  j0422@xmath3232 ( e.g. @xcite ) and swift  j1753.6@xmath00127 ( e.g. @xcite ) in the galactic halo .",
    "_ swift _  is particuarly suited to study of this subclass of objects , as their low absorption column allows _ swift _  to detect both low absorption x - ray , important for good quality continuum fitting in xrt s soft x - ray band pass , and uv / optical emission , which is typically too extincted to be seen in galactic plane transients .",
    "the results discussed in this section have been published by @xcite . here",
    "i focus on the _ swift _  contribution to that paper .",
    "igr  j00569@xmath07226   was first discovered by _",
    "integral _ in 2013 in scans of the small magnellanic cloud performed on october 25 - 26 , 2013 and october 30 - 31 , 2013 @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations were performed by _ swift _  on nov 5th , 2013 , observing the field in pc mode for 1-ks .",
    "a new x - ray transient was detected by _ swift _  inside the _ integral _ reported error circle at the following coordinates : ra(j2000 ) = 00h 57 m 02.34s , dec(j2000 ) = -72d 25 m 55.34s with an estimated uncertainty of 2.6 arc - seconds radius ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "this position was consistent with the catalogued massive star ngc 330 - 070 , a b0.5e type star .",

    "the results of these observations can be seen in figure  [ sxp505_eclipse ] , and clearly show not only a broad dipping , likely caused by attention by the edge of the accretion disk , but also a short eclipse of the ns by the primary star .",
