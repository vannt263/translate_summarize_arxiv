    "some 190 extrasolar planets have been detected since 1992 .",
    "most of these discoveries have been performed using radial velocimetry .",
    "recent progresses and new instruments have permitted the lowering of the mass detection threshold to tens of earth masses ( m@xmath3 ) .",
    "for instance , a 14-m@xmath3  ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the inclination of the planet orbital plane ) planet around the star ( santos et al .",
    "2004 ) , a 7.5-m@xmath3  planet around ( rivera et al .",
    "2005 ) , and a 10-m@xmath3  planet around ( lovis et al .",
    "2006 ) have been reported .",
    "all these objects lie at the mass boundary between telluric and ice giant planets , as it is inferred from analogy with the solar system ice giants , and ( 14.5 and 17.2  m@xmath3 , respectively ) . besides , all low - mass planets discovered with radial velocimetry are orbiting very close to their parent stars , @xmath6  astronomical units ( au ) , so they are enduring extreme radiative heating ( lecavelier des etangs 2006 ) , an unknown situation in the solar system . indeed , the radial - velocity technique is biased towards short - orbital - period planets .    on the contrary ,",
    "the microlensing technique is sensible to planets with larger semi - major axis , hence it allows to detect a different kind of planets . using this technique , beaulieu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have detected a @xmath0-m@xmath3  planet orbiting at @xmath1  au  from a @xmath7-solar - mass ( m@xmath8 ) star .",
    "it is potentially the lightest exoplanet detected so far .",
    "this star and its planet are the lens of the gravitational microlensing event ogle-2005-blg-390 ( see table  [ tab : lens ] ) and the star , according to its mass range , is a m star , with a luminosity reaching only @xmath9  solar luminosity ( l@xmath8 ) .",
    "hence , the amount of energy per surface unit this planet receives from its star is comparable to that of pluto in the solar system ( @xmath10  wm@xmath11 ) .",
    "the planet detected by beaulieu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , poetically designated as ogle-2005-blg-390 lb , is thus a cold sub - uranus object .    in the light of the orbital elements and masses presented in beaulieu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the planet can be a cold and massive analog of the earth , or alternatively be similar to a frozen ocean - planet having retained a lot of water ( lger et al .",
    "2004 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the question arises if the planet is entirely frozen or if liquid water can exist close to the surface . to answer that question , we focus on the phase study of water ( h@xmath12o ) in the first @xmath13  km under the planetary surface , using observational constrains and similarities with icy satellites of the solar system .",
    "a full model of the entire planet is certainly beyond the scope of the present work ( see sotin et al .",
    "2006 for a detailed study of the internal structure of these kinds of extrasolar planets ) .",
    "all the parameters of the lens system deduced from the detection are related to the mass of the lens star @xmath14 .",
    "the mass of the planet @xmath15 is simply given by the relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the planet - to - star mass ratio measured by beaulieu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and given in table  [ tab : lens ] .",
    "we took advantage of these correlations ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : mplanet_to_mstar ] , [ eq : poly_a ] , and [ eq : l_star ] ] ) to estimate the basic properties of the system as a function of the stellar and planetary masses , such as the semi - major axis of the planet and the stellar luminosity (   [ sec : constraints ] ) .",
    "then , we calculated the energy the planet is receiving from its star and its equilibrium temperature , again as a function of the planetary mass (   [ sec : temp ] ) .",
    "given the surface temperature and the atmospheric scale height , we then discuss on the possible nature of an atmosphere (   [ sec : atmo ] ) .      the microlensing event ogle-2005-blg-390 is described by beaulieu et al.(2006 ) , and the relevant parameters for this study are presented in table  [ tab : lens ] .",
    "all the parameters are in fact represented by a bayesian distribution of probability .",
    "we have explored the phase space allowed by the results presented in the above - cited paper .",
    "beaulieu et al.s analysis ( based on dominik 2006 ) yields 95% probability that the lens star be a main sequence star , 4% that it be a white dwarf , and less than 1% that it be a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "they find a 75% probability that the star be part of the galactic bulge .",
    "when adopting a source star distance of 8.5  kpc , the lens star is estimated to be @xmath18-kpc away , toward the galactic center .",
    "zoccali et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have shown that the bulge is about 10-billion - years ( gyr ) old with no evidence for younger stellar populations .",
    "they also proved that the bulge metallicity is peaked near the solar value , with a sharp cutoff just above this value and a tail towards lower metallicity .",
    "as part of the bulge population , we therefore consider that the lens system ( star and planet ) is likely to be @xmath19-gyr old , with a solar metallicity .",
    "the mass of the stellar lens derived from beaulieu et al .",
    "is @xmath20  m@xmath8 , within a range [ 0.11,0.43 ]  m@xmath8 , .",
    "] i.e. , most probably the mass of a m - type star . in that range and using eq .",

    "the separation of the lens @xmath21 is expressed in einstein s radii , @xmath22 . from the equation defining @xmath22 as a function of @xmath14 ( see table  1 in beaulieu et al .",
    "2006 ) , the semi - major axis @xmath23 of the planet can be expressed as @xmath24 given the stellar - mass range explored , @xmath23 is within [ 1.5,3.8 ]  au .    to estimate the surface temperature of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb ( see   [ sec : temp ] ) we need first estimate the stellar luminosity @xmath25 .",
    "this is done using a mass - luminosity relation derived from baraffe et al.(1998 ) for a solar metallicity , ( see also beaulieu et al .",
    "2006b , in preparation ) @xmath26 considering again the same stellar - mass range than above , the luminosity of the planet host star should be within [ 0.001,0.02 ]  l@xmath8 .",
    "this result would be barely changed by assuming a different metallicity than solar ; for instance , a 0.5-dex decrease in metallicity would increase the luminosity by @xmath27 ( still according to baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) , then triggering only a @xmath28-k increase in the surface temperature of the planet ( see below ) .      from the semi - major axis of the planet and the stellar luminosity , it is straightforward to calculate the amount of energy received by the planet and thus its equilibrium surface temperature , which also depends on the surface albedo .",
    "the power received per surface unit is @xmath29 , i.e. , within [ 0.2,0.8 ]  wm@xmath11 .",
    "this is roughly the same amount of energy received by pluto or neptune from the sun .",
    "analogously to the outer planets of the solar system , which formed and remained beyond the snowline , ogle-2005-blg-390 lb can contain an important fraction of volatile material ( ices ) and thus ressemble a massive ganymede with frozen surface .",
    "we then assume an albedo @xmath30 of 50% for an ice - covered surface and calculate the surface temperature of the planet , taken to be the equilibrium temperature , @xmath31{\\frac{l_\\star \\left(m_\\star\\right ) \\left(1-a\\right)}{16 \\pi a^2 \\sigma}},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath33 is the stellar luminosity as a function of the stellar mass , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_star ] ) . as @xmath14 is related to @xmath15 through eq .",
    "( [ eq : mplanet_to_mstar ] ) , the stellar luminosity is also a function of @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ fig : t_vs_m ] represents the surface temperature as a function of the planetary mass . considering the parameter range given above",
    ", @xmath34 is within [ 35,47 ]  k.      given the surface temperature range , the vapor pressure of most volatile species of interest ( h@xmath12o , methane ch@xmath35 , ammonia nh@xmath36 , carbon dioxide co@xmath12 ) is very weak , below 0.01  pa . only carbon monoxide ( co ) and molecular nitrogen ( n@xmath12 ) have relatively high vapor pressures at these temperatures ( @xmath37  pa at 47  k , @xmath38  pa at 35  k ) .",
    "moreover , n@xmath12 starts sublimating around 47  k , where @xmath39  pa .",
    "thus , these two species are the most likely to be present in the planetary atmosphere .    for a planetary mass within [ 3,11 ]  m@xmath3 , and given the radii we estimate in   [ sec : radius ]",
    ", the surface gravity of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb lies within [ 10,30 ]  ms@xmath11 .",
    "we consequently estimate the atmospheric scale height for n@xmath12 or co to be within [ 0.5,1 ]  km . considering the small scale height and vapor pressure for n@xmath12 , we hypothesize the presence of a tenuous atmosphere of n@xmath12 with a surface pressure @xmath40  hpa .",
    "note that the atmospheric pressure measured at the surface of pluto ( 0.5  pa according to sicardy et al .",
    "2003 ) is lower than the vapor pressure of n@xmath12 at pluto s surface temperature ( @xmath41  k ) , therefore , the nitrogen vapor pressure of 1  hpa can be considered as an upper limit to the actual atmospheric pressure in our case .",
    "anyway , it is a fairly weak value , insignificant for the calculation of the ice shell structure ( see   [ sec : liquid_now ] ) .",
    "we further take an atmospheric pressure at the surface @xmath42 .",
    "the main properties of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb deduced from the measurements of beaulieu et al.(2006 ) suggest an extremely cold surface . if liquid water is to exist somewhere in this planet , it is very likely below an icy crust , as in the icy satellites of the solar system .",
    "we saw in the previous section that liquid water can not exist on the surface of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb because of the low temperature and pressure . instead , the surface of the planet should be frozen ice .",
    "the question is then : can liquid water exist below the ice layer ?",
    "a description of the physical states of water in the ice shell can be obtained using a phase diagram and knowing the evolution of the pressure and temperature within the ice shell .",
    "the pressure at a depth @xmath43 in the ice shell is @xmath44 it depends on the gravity of the planet , hence on its radius .",
    "models of possible internal structures for earth - mass extrasolar planets have already been developed .",
    "the radius of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb is found using such a model ( sotin et al .",
    "2006 ) , which a basic version has been used by lger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the modeling of ` ocean - planets ' .",
    "its physical approach is analogous to that of valencia et al.(2006 ) .",
    "the main difference is that the bulk composition of the planet is fixed by the composition of the star .",
    "the input parameters are the stellar iron - to - silicium [ fe / si ] and magnesium - to - silicium [ mg / si ] ratios , the magnesium content of the silicate mantle @xmath45 $ ] , the amount of h@xmath12o , and the total mass of the planet ( sotin et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "solar [ fe / si ] and [ mg / si ] are assumed together with a terrestrial mg@xmath46 .",
    "it can be noted that varying these numbers from the solar and terrestrial values changes the size of the metallic core ( composed by fe and iron sulphide fes ) and the amount of fe in the silicate mantle , but causes small differences on the computed planetary radii ( 3/1000 in average ) . on the contrary",
    ", the amount of h@xmath12o strongly influences the radius for a given planetary mass .",
    "we consider different enrichments of the planet in h@xmath12o , namely 0.025 , 25 , and 50% of the planetary mass .",
    "mass - radius relationships are then derived using appropriate equations of state for the different layers .",
    "the mie - grneisen - debye formulation has been chosen for describing the iron core ( uchida et al .",
    "2001 ) , the lower silicate mantle ( hemley et al .  1992 ) and the icy mantle ( fei et al .",
    "the 3@xmath47-order birch - mrnaghan equation of state is used for the upper silicate mantle ( vacher et al .",
    "1998 ) and for the liquid layer ( lide 2005 ) .",
    "the 0.025%wt - h@xmath12o  case corresponds to a rocky planet with a h@xmath12o content similar to the earth one .",
    "the model yields a structure consisting of a metallic core accounting for 32%wt and a rocky mantle ( silicates ) accounting for @xmath48wt , where @xmath49 represents the mass fraction of silicates in the planet .",
    "the resulting radius is within [ 1.3,2.0 ]  r@xmath3depending on the planetary mass .    for both other cases , 25 and 50%wt - h@xmath12o ,",
    "the silicate - mantle - to - iron - core mass ratio remains similar to the 0.025%wt case , i.e. , about 2/1 . over the whole planet ,",
    "the silicates must account for @xmath50wt and @xmath51wt in the 25 and 50%wt cases , respectively .",
    "planetary radii are found wihtin [ 1.4,2.3 ]  r@xmath3  and [ 1.6,2.5 ]  r@xmath3 , respectively , depending on the planetary mass .",
    "these results are summerized in fig .",
    "[ fig : planetprop ] .      due to the low surface temperature , the volatile material present in ogle-2005-blg-390 lb must be condensed as an ice shell .",
    "since the planet is massive enough to be completely differentiated , the ice shell must be overtopping a denser rocky core , in a situation similar to that of the icy moons of giant planets in the solar system .",
    "if the planet contains the same proportion of water than the earth , that is , very few : @xmath52 , the maximum pressure at the bottom of the ice shell is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is within [ 15,29 ]  ms@xmath11 for a planetary mass in [ 3,11 ]  m@xmath3 .",
    "then , @xmath55 , i.e. , within [ 0.07,0.25 ]  gpa . therefore , from the phase diagram of water represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram],o is available on the website _ water structure and behavior _ by m.  chaplin , at ` http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/phase.html ` . ]",
    "the ice shell is only composed of ice  i or possibly a liquid layer surrounded by a thin layer of ice  i. using eq .",
    "( [ eq : p(z ) ] ) , the depth of the interface ice  i / silicates or liquid / silicates is found within [ 5,9 ]  km ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : camembert_no_h2o ] ) .",
    "consequently , the icy mantle that covers the silicates is rather small compared to the planetary radius ; it consists of a thin ( @xmath56  km ) low - pressure ice - i layer .",
    "if a non - negligible fraction of the planetary mass is accounted for by water , then the ice shell must be largely composed of high - pressure ice due to the strong gravity ( from 10 to 22  ms@xmath11 depending on the planetary mass and the mass percentage of h@xmath12o ) .",
    "the most stable phase at low temperature ( 10 to 200  k ) and moderate pressure ( 0.2 to 0.6  gpa ) is ice  ii ; at higher pressures ( deeper in the planet ) , we successively meet ice  vi , vii , and x ( those last two phases lie beyond the pressure scale in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase_diagram ] , at pressure greater than 2  gpa ) .",
    "indeed , we find @xmath57 within [ 40,210 ]  gpa , well in the domain of high - pressure ices . in such a case",
    ", the icy mantle must be split into an upper thin low - pressure ice - i / ii layer and a thick high - pressure layer composed by ices  v , vi , vii , and x. actually , there is an important endothermic frontier at the phase transitions ice  ii / v and ii / vi , which is located around @xmath58  gpa ( bercovici et al .",
    "1986 ) . with eq .",
    "( [ eq : p(z ) ] ) , we estimated the ice - i / ii layer is never thicker than about 60  km ( fig .  [",
    "fig : camembert_plenty_h2o ] ) .",
    "hence , in this case we distinguish between a thin ( @xmath59  km ) low - pressure ice ( i / ii ) and a thick ( @xmath60  km ) high - pressure ice ( vi / vii ) mantle .    in any cases",
    ", an entirely - solid ice shell is overtopped by a layer of low - pressure ice  i. if there is not much ice in the planet (   [ sec : water - poor shell ] ) , the whole ice shell is ice  i. on the contrary , if the amount of ice in the planet is large (   [ sec : water - rich shell ] ) , high - pressure phases of h@xmath12o must be found below the ice - i lid .",
    "because of the negative slope of the melting curve of ice  i as a function of pressure , a liquid layer could only exist between ice  i and silicates or between ice  i and high - pressure ices .",
    "considering the low surface temperature on ogle-2005-blg-390 lb ( @xmath61k ) and an adiabatic ocean @xmath62 ) that encircles the world in the greek mythology . ] below ice  i , the bottom of the ocean must be at pressure @xmath63  gpa .",
    "therefore , due to the high gravity on ogle-2005-blg-390 lb , the thickness of such an ocean must be smaller than about 50  km .",
    "the internal heat flow determines the temperature profile within the planet , and particularly within the ice layer . knowing that the most probable age of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb is 10  gyr , the main source of internal heat at present time is the decay of long - lived radioactive isotopes of uranium ( @xmath64u and @xmath65u ) , thorium ( @xmath66th ) , and potassium ( @xmath67k ) .",
    "another non - negligible contribution to the heat flow is the secular cooling of the residual heat produced during the planet formation ( 20% for the earth according to turcotte & schubert 2001 ) . in the following , we assume that the present heat flow is equal to the radiogenic heat flow .",
    "we take the mass fractions of the radioactive isotopes in the planet when it was 4.56-gyr old similar to those of the earth at the present time .",

    "@xmath122 across the convective layer is twice the temperature difference across the two thermal boundary layers ( @xmath123 ) given by ( sotin & tobie 2004 ) @xmath124^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath121 and @xmath111 are the melting temperature and the temperature in the convective well - mixed adiabatic ice layer .",
    "spohn & schubert ( 2003 ) use typical values @xmath125 and @xmath126 , while deschamps & sotin ( 2001 ) use @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "large @xmath129-values correspond to very efficient heat transport by convection .",
    "then , the temperature remains close to the surface temperature , and hardly reaches the melting temperature .",
    "the presence of ice is favored . on the contrary ,",
    "low @xmath129-values favors the presence of an ocean below a convective ice layer . in the following",
    ", we will consider both sets of values for @xmath129 and @xmath130 .        to have a liquid layer below the ice shell",
    ", the temperature must reach the melting temperature above the triple point i / iii / liquid at 0.21  gpa and 251  k ; in other words , the temperature gradient below the surface must be steep enough to reach the melting temperature within the ice - i shell . then , below this level , we have an ocean whose depth is limited by the pressure above which the liquid water is compressed into high - pressure ice ( fig .  [",
    "fig : camembert_no_h2o ] and  [ fig : camembert_plenty_h2o ] ) .    using the equations of ",
    "[ sec : conduction ] and [ sec : convection ] , we can evaluate the minimum pressure  when only conduction drives the heat flow  and the maximum pressure  when there is a convective layer below a conductive lid  at which the temperature reaches the melting temperature .",
    "if the minimum pressure is larger than the triple point pressure , no ocean is possible below the ice shell .",
    "if the maximum pressure is smaller than the triple point pressure ( i.e. , if the temperature reaches the melting temperature despite the very efficient heat transfer by a convective layer ) , then the presence of an ocean is warrantied .",
    "taking the temperature profile obtained when only conduction drives the heat flow ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag_diffusion ] ) , we see that it does not reach the melting temperature in the 0.025 and 50%wt cases",
    ". therefore , an ocean within the ice - i shell of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb can not be present . in the 0.025%wt case ,",
    "there is simply not enough water and the maximum temperature reached at the bottom of the ice shell is in any cases well below 150  k. thus , no liquid water is possible . in the 50%wt case , deeper in the planet ,",
    "the maximum temperature reached at the bottom of the ice - ii shell is in any cases well below 250  k. this does not allow for the presence of liquid water either .    only in the 25%wt case , the temperature profile crosses the melting curve , although it does so below the triple point",
    "i / iii / liquid , at pressure of about 0.5  gpa .",
    "this means that conduction alone is not able to transfer the heat from below across the solid ice shell .",
    "a conductive equilibrium does not exist in this case and the temperature profile plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag_diffusion ] is not realistic .",
    "convection is likely to set up in the high - pressure ice and the temperature gradient can be steeper than the one calculated with conduction only . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux conv ] ) for the heat flow at 10  gyr and other equations of ",
    "[ sec : convection ] , and taking the parameters @xmath129 and @xmath130 typical of a very efficient heat transport by convection ( deschamps & sotin 2001 ) , we find that the convective layer can be thick enough to allow the heat to be transferred without the temperature reaching the melting temperature .",
    "the presence of liquid water is not allowed in that case . however ,",
    "if less efficient convection is considered by using smaller @xmath129-values ( spohn & schubert 2003 ) , we find that the temperature can effectively reach the melting temperature within the ice - ii layer . in this very last case",
    ", solid - state convection can not evacuate the heat from below , therefore the ice - ii / v shell must be partly melted .",
    "nevertheless , in all the cases considered , the temperature profile never crosses the melting curve above @xmath104  gpa .",
    "therefore , an ocean can not exist between ice  i and higher - pressure ices .",
    "our study in which ( i ) the surface temperature is as cold as the equilibrium temperature , ( ii ) the ice is pure h@xmath12o - ice , and ( iii ) the internal heat only consists in the radiogenic heat , implies that the ice - i shell of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb must be entirely frozen whatever the amount of water and the mass of the planet .",
    "thus , no ocean can be present between ice  i and high - pressure ice .    only in the case of an intermediate amount of water , around 25%wt , there is a possibility to have liquid water within the ice - ii / v shell because both thermal conduction and low - efficient solid - state convection are unable to remove the internal heat of the planet .",
    "if , however , solid - state convection is as efficient as proposed by deschamps & sotin ( 2001 ) , then no liquid water exist in the ice - ii / v layer of the 25%wt case .",
    "in fact , the existence of liquid water is the result of a competition between two fundamental parameters : the heating @xmath80 on one hand and the thickness of the ice layer on the other hand .",
    "given the mass of the planet , the more water the planet contains , the less massive the silicate mantle is , and thus the more water in the planet , the less radiogenic heat there is to warm the ice .",
    "meanwhile , the more water in the planet , the thicker the ice shell can be . therefore , higher temperatures can be reached in the ice shell above the silicate mantle .",
    "this competition explains why the intermediate case with 25%wt water appears to be the most favorable for the presence of liquid water in ogle-2005-blg-390 lb , while in both 0.025 and 50%wt cases , there are no possibilities for the presence of liquid water .",
    "in the previous section , we found that if the surface temperature of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb is equal to the equilibrium temperature ( from 35 to 47  k for planetary masses of 3 to 11  m@xmath3 , respectively ) and the ice composition is 100% h@xmath12o , then no oceans can be found between ice - i and high - pressure ices .",
    "we will discuss now the effects of a surface temperature larger than the equilibrium temperature , of a different composition of the ice , and finally of a larger internal heating .",
    "the possibility of the presence of an atmosphere thick enough to trigger a greenhouse effect or a smaller albedo could rise significantly the surface temperature .",
    "for instance , an albedo close to zero would increase the equilibrium temperature by a factor @xmath131{2}$ ] , that is about 19% .",
    "therefore , we shall evaluate the minimum increase in the surface temperature that allows the existence of an ocean between low- and high - pressure ices .    as a first approach",
    ", we can calculate the maximum temperature at the pressure @xmath132 of the triple point i / iii / liquid with thermal conduction only (   [ sec : conduction ] ) .",
    "on one hand , for a given heat flow and at the pressure of the triple point corresponding to the base of the low - pressure ice shell , there is a diffusive coefficient @xmath133 . on the other hand",
    ", the ratio of the melting temperature at the triple point ( @xmath134  k ) to the actual surface temperature ( @xmath34 ) is equivalent to a minimum diffusive coefficient above which the water can melt .",
    "an ocean could exist if the increase of the surface temperature is above @xmath135 where @xmath136    using this equation , we find that an increase of the surface temperature of at least [ 40,55 ] , [ 65,80 ] , and [ 100,115 ]  k , for the 0.025 , 25 , and 50%wt cases , respectively , are required in order to partly melt the ice layer .",
    "however , those values can not be obtained with smaller albedo and are unlikely to result from a greenhouse effect , given the small energy the planet is receiving from its star and the tenuous atmosphere of n@xmath12 .",
    "we have assumed that the ice shell of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb is only made of the different phases of h@xmath12o .",
    "however , due to the low temperature at the surface of the planet ( from 35 to 47  k , see   [ sec : temp ] ) , not only h@xmath12o , but also nh@xmath36 , ch@xmath35 , and possibly n@xmath12 can condense .",
    "an accurate model of the ice shell would therefore need including these species in addition to h@xmath12o , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a number of detailed studies have shown that a mixture of h@xmath12o and , e.g. , nh@xmath36 crystallizes at a lower temperature than pure h@xmath12o ( see , e.g. , sotin et al .",
    "1998 ; spohn & schubert 2003 ) . the melting curve of this mixture is plotted in figs .  [",
    "fig : phase_diagram ] and [ fig : phase_diag_diffusion ] .",
    "it shows that our previous results remain unchanged .",
    "in fact , the maximum temperatures calculated at the base of the ice - i shell are below the crystallizing temperature of both ammoniated and pure water in all cases . therefore , no ocean is possible below the ice - i lid , even with the presence of nh@xmath36 .",
    "similarly to the estimation of the surface temperature in   [ sec : greenhouse ] , we can calculate how much the internal heating has to be increased in order to partially melt the frozen ice shells .",
    "the minimum heat production @xmath137 above which the temperature can reach the melting temperature @xmath138 at pressure of the triple point i / iii / liquid , @xmath139 , can be estimated using results of   [ sec : conduction ] and is given by : @xmath140 }       { \\ln\\left[\\delta(p_{\\textrm{{\\sc i}}},h'_\\mathrm{rad})\\right]}.\\ ] ] we find that the heat production calculated at 10  gyr has to be multiplied by a factor of at least 1.6 to 1.9 in order to have liquid water in the 0%wt h@xmath12o case , a factor of 2.1 to 2.5 in the 25%wt h@xmath12o case , and 3.2 to 3.8 in the 50%wt h@xmath12o case .    if we allow for convection as in   [ sec : convection ] , we obtain larger heat production rate . if we use small values of @xmath129 corresponding to a convection inefficient for the transport of the internal heat , the results are barely changed .",
    "if we assume a much more efficient convection in the ice - i shell , we find that the heating rates needed to obtain liquid water are 75 to 100% larger than those obtained by neglecting the convection .",
    "for instance , for a 5.5-m@xmath3planet with 25%wt h@xmath12o , the heating rate needed to reach the melting temperature within the low - pressure ice is 3.9 and 2.2 higher than the heating at 10  gyr , for a large and a small @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "those results are barely changed by the possible presence of nh@xmath36 .",
    "although the present - day ogle-2005-blg-390 lb is likely to be entirely frozen , the heating needed to have liquid water below the surface of this planet is only a factor - of - a - few larger than the calculated radiogenic heating at 10  gyr .",
    "it must be recalled that this radiogenic heating is only a minimum : a remnant heat from the accretion is certainly not negligible , in particular for such a massive planet .",
    "a comparison with the earth shows that it could be of the same order as the radiogenic heating .",
    "moreover , in the past the radiogenic heat was larger . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : heat ] ) , the radiogenic heat is a factor of 2 and 4 larger when the planet was 4.4- and 1.8-gyr old .",
    "this allows us to suggest that liquid water was certainly present in the past during several billion years below the surface of ogle-2005-blg-390 lb .",
    "because ogle-2005-blg-390 lb orbits a few au  away from a faint m star and is about 10-gyr old , this planet is likely to be entirely frozen .    in the favored scenario ,",
    "the planet has no heavy atmosphere and its surface temperature is close to the equilibrium temperature of a black body ( 35 to 47  k ) ; then , the surface should be entirely frozen .",
    "if the planet contains terrestrial amounts of water ( or much more ) , a @xmath141-km- ( or @xmath142-km- ) thick ice mantle can be present .",
    "the radiogenic heat production rate , which depends on the quantity of water / silicates contained in the planet , is probably not sufficient to prevent a potential sub - surface ocean from freezing completely at the likely age of 10  gyr .",
    "however , remnant heat and larger radiogenic heating in the past allow us to suggest that a liquid ocean must have been present during several billion years . in similarity with the icy satellites of the solar system",
    ", this liquid water was located below low - pressure ice  i. at the bottom of the ocean , either a silicate mantle or high - pressure ices could be found , for water - poor or water - rich planet , respectively .    in some respects ,",
    "ogle-2005-blg-390 lb opens a new frontier in modeling extra - solar planets : not only because it is presently the closest planet to the earth in terms of mass , but also because it is located at the cold border of its planetary system , beyond the snowline . up to now , the greatest interest has been shown in observing and modeling hot jupiters and planets close to their star , mainly because they were the first to be detected . microlensing detection technique",
    "has now the potential to unveil a population of ice giants , frozen ocean - planets , and other snowball earths .",
    "the present work is a first approach to such objects .",
    "it opens new perspectives for exoplanetology .",
