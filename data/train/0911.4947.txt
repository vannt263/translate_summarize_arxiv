    "as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : starkhole ] and [ fig : starkdipole ] , we observe a linear frequency shift of 24.6 @xmath24 0.7 khz@xmath8cm / v .",
    "for example , an electric field of 100 v / mm leads to a displacement of the resonance frequency by 25 mhz . in the case of a tm waveguide , where electrodes can be spaced as closely as 10 @xmath3 m ,",
    "this requires the application of 1 volt . since",
    "low voltages can be switched rapidly with ease , waveguides provide the ability to reversibly broaden and manipulate absorbers within hundreds of picoseconds .",
    "waveguide . ]     0.7 khz@xmath8cm / v . ]",
    "[ conclusion ]    to conclude , our findings demonstrate the suitability of ti : tm : linb@xmath2 waveguides cooled to 3 k for implementations of photon - echo quantum memory protocols .",
    "level structure , lifetimes , and branching ratios allow tailoring of the natural , inhomogeneously broadened absorption profile  either via optical pumping into the @xmath4f@xmath5 bottleneck state ( then possibly allowing storage of nanosecond pulses ) , or into one of the long - lived ground states that appear under the application of magnetic fields . the minimum width of spectral holes of around one mhz , as determined by spectral diffusion , will limit storage of quantum information in optical coherence to a few hundred nanoseconds . while longer times may be achievable at lower temperature , this is still sufficient for mapping coherence onto long - lived ground state coherence , as rabi frequencies exceeding hundred mhz can be obtained , due to the high power densities achievable inside waveguiding structures .",
    "we point out that ground state coherence of 300 @xmath3s have been reported for tm : yag @xcite , but investigations for ti : tm : linbo@xmath2 remain to be done .",
    "finally , the existance of a linear stark shift , together with the possibility to space electrodes closely , allows shifting of resonance frequencies by more than 100 mhz within sub - nanosecond times , thus enabling novel phase control techniques .",
    "interestingly , the lifetimes and branching ratio found in our study differ from those reported for tm : linbo@xmath16 bulk crystals probed at 794.22 nm wavelength and 1.7 k @xcite",
    ". the difference could be due to the addition of titanium to our sample , which may alter radiative or non - radiative decay channels @xcite , to wavelength - dependent spectroscopic properties as suggested in @xcite , or to concentration dependence @xcite .",
    "finally , we point out that re doped waveguides , here ti : tm : linbo@xmath2 , are not only interesting for quantum state storage using a photon - echo approach , but also for other approaches , e.g. based on electromagnetically induced transparency and slow light @xcite .",
