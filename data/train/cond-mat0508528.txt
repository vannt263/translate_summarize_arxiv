    "the equiatomic rare - earth(@xmath7 ) transition - metal(@xmath8 ) magnesium compounds @xmath0 mg have intensively been investigated in recent years with respect to their crystal chemistry and to a basic characterization of their magnetic properties.@xcite with the trivalent rare earth elements , the re@xmath8 mg intermetallics adopt the hexagonal zrnial structure,@xcite while those with a divalent rare earth metal , i.e.  europium and ytterbium , crystallize in the orthorhombic tinisi type structure.@xcite interesting magnetic properties have been observed for several of the @xmath0 mg compounds . to give some examples ,",
    "long - range magnetic ordering has been observed for ce@xmath8 mg ( @xmath9 , pt , au ) at 2.1 , 3.6 , and 2.0k , respectively.@xcite euagmg and euaumg order ferromagnetically at relatively high curie temperatures of 22 and 37k.@xcite similar behaviour was observed for the gadolinium - based compounds gd@xmath8 mg ( @xmath9 , ag , pt ) , which show ferromagnetic order at 96 , 39 , and 98k for @xmath10 , ag , pt , respectively.@xcite in contrast , gdauin and gdaumg order antiferromagnetically with nel temperatures of 13 and 81k , respectively.@xcite not much is known , however , about the transport and thermodynamic properties of these compounds , in particular about their magnetic field dependencies . in this report",
    "we present resistivity measurements and specific heat data for some @xmath7agmg and @xmath7aumg compounds and for gdauin in the temperature range from about 2 to 300k and in external magnetic fields up to 14 t .",
    "we have also extended the magnetization measurements up to 14 t , which we use to calculate the magnetocaloric effect .",
    "starting materials for the preparation of the intermetallic compounds @xmath0 mg and gdauin were sublimed ingots of the rare earth elements ( johnson - matthey , chempur or kelpin , @xmath11% ) , silver and gold wire ( diameter 1 mm , degussa- hls , @xmath12% ) , a magnesium rod ( johnson matthey , diameter 16 mm , @xmath13% ) , and indium tear drops ( johnson matthey , 99.9% ) .",
    "gdauin was prepared by arc - melting@xcite of the elements under an atmosphere of @xmath14 mbar argon .",
    "the argon was purified over titanium sponge ( 970k ) , silica gel , and molecular sieves prior to use .",
    "the arc - melted button was remelted three times to ensure homogeneity . due to the low boiling point and the high vapor pressure ,",
    "the magnesium containing samples can not be obtained via a simple arc - melting procedure , where a significant weight loss would occur through evaporation of magnesium .",
    "all these compounds were prepared in sealed high - melting metal tubes .",
    "the elements were mixed in the ideal 1:1:1 atomic ratios and sealed in small ( tube size @xmath15@xmath16 ) niobium or tantalum tubes under an argon pressure of @xmath17 mbar .",
    "these tubes were then put in a water - cooled sample chamber@xcite of a high - frequency furnace ( httinger elektronik , freiburg , tig 1.5/300 ) .",
    "the samples were first rapidly heated to @xmath18k and subsequently annealed at @xmath19k for another two hours .",
    "the temperature was controlled through a sensor therm metis ms09 pyrometer with an accuracy of @xmath20k .",
    "the samples could be separated from the tubes by mechanical fragmentation .",
    "no reaction with the metal tubes was observed .",
    "the polycrystalline samples are light grey with metallic lustre . for more details concerning the synthesis conditions we refer to the original literature .",
    "the purity of the samples was checked through guinier powder patterns using cuk@xmath21 radiation and @xmath22-quartz as an internal standard .",
    "the guinier camera was equipped with an image plate system ( fujifilm , bas-1800 ) .",
    "the experimental patterns were compared with calculated ones,@xcite using the atomic positions from the previous single crystal studies.@xcite all samples were pure phases on the level of x - ray powder diffraction .    for the measurements of resistivity , magnetization and specific heat we have polished larger polycrystalline pieces of irregular shape to a rectangular shape of typical dimensions of about @xmath23mm@xmath24 .",
    "the specific heat and the magnetization have been studied in a physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) using the relaxation time method and a vibrating sample magnetometer , respectively .",
    "the resistivity has been measured by a standard dc four - probe technique .",
    "all these measurements have been performed in the temperature range from about 2 to 300k and in magnetic fields up to 14 t .",
    "the crystal structures of the @xmath0 mg intermetallics depend on the valence of the rare earth element . with the trivalent",
    "rare earth metals , the @xmath0 mg compounds adopt the hexagonal zrnial , type,@xcite while the europium and ytterbium compounds contain eu@xmath25 and yb@xmath25 and they adopt the orthorhombic tinisi type.@xcite in both structure types , the transition metal and magnesium atoms build up a three - dimensional [ @xmath8 mg ] network in which the rare earth atoms fill distorted hexagonal channels .",
    "gdauin also crystallizes with the zrnial structure . for more details on the crystal chemistry and chemical bonding of these @xmath0 mg intermetallics",
    "we refer to the original literature.@xcite       resistivity of @xmath0 mg with @xmath26 , eu , gd , or la and @xmath27 or ag and of gdauin.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    figure[rho ] gives an overview of the resistivity @xmath28 of the different compounds . for all samples",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath28 is metallic .",
    "however , the absolute values are strongly different , ranging from a few @xmath29 in ybaumg up to @xmath30 in gdauin .",
    "we find the following trends .",
    "the @xmath0 mg samples with divalent yb and eu have lower @xmath28 values than the compounds with trivalent la and gd .",
    "this indicates that the different @xmath28 is related to the different structure of the divalent ( tinisi type ) and of the trivalent ( zrnial type ) @xmath7-based compounds .",
    "gdauin also adopts the zrnial structure , but it has a significantly larger @xmath28 than gdaumg .",
    "possibly this is related to the different valences of in ( trivalent ) and mg ( divalent ) . combining this observation with the different resistivities of the trivalent and the divalent @xmath7-based compounds",
    ", one observes that @xmath28 increases with increasing number of valence electrons for the entire series @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , almost all @xmath7aumg samples have lower @xmath28 values than the corresponding @xmath7agmg samples ( the only exception is gd@xmath8 mg ) . lda+u",
    "band - structure calculations and photoemission studies are currently underway in order to check whether these trends correlate with systematic changes in the band structure for the different compounds .",
    "resistivity of paramagnetic @xmath0 mg for different magnetic fields [ panels ( a)(c ) ] .",
    "the respective insets show the magnetoresistance @xmath32/\\rho(h=0)$ ] ( increasing field strength is indicated by the arrows ) .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show that the magnetoresistance curves for different field strengths follow a single line if @xmath33 is plotted as a function of @xmath34 as it is expected from kohler s rule . ]",
    "there are pronounced kinks in @xmath35 of the gd- and eu - based compounds .",
    "these kinks arise from the ferro- or antiferromagnetic ordering of the @xmath36 moments of gd and eu .",
    "in contrast , the la- and yb - based materials show continuous @xmath35 curves without any anomalies reflecting that the latter materials are paramagnetic down to the lowest temperature . in figure[rhopm ] we show the resistance of the paramagnets for different magnetic fields . for all samples",
    "we find a systematic increase of @xmath28 with increasing field .",
    "this increase becomes the more pronounced the lower the temperature is . in the insets of figure[rhopm ] we present the normalized magnetoresistance @xmath32/\\rho(h=0)$ ] .",
    "for ybagmg @xmath33 reaches more than 90% at about 5k and a field of 14 t , whereas only about 15% is obtained for ybaumg . in laagmg",
    "the absolute change @xmath37 is comparable to that of ybagmg , but the relative change @xmath33 is reduced by about a factor of 20 due to the larger @xmath38 of laagmg .",
    "the field - induced increase of @xmath28 is a consequence of the additional scattering of the charge carriers due to the lorentz force as it is observed in many metals.@xcite within semiclassical transport theory one expects the so - called kohler s rule to hold , which predicts that @xmath33 follows a universal function @xmath39 over the entire field and temperature range . as shown in the upper panels of figure[rhopm ] , this is rather well fulfilled . for both yb - based samples",
    "@xmath40 is roughly proportional to @xmath41.@xcite     resistivity of ferromagnetic @xmath0 mg for different magnetic fields ( increasing field strength is indicated by the arrows ) .",
    "the insets show the magnetoresistance @xmath42/\\rho(h=0)$ ] . ]    in figure[rhofm ] the resistivity of eu@xmath8 mg with @xmath43 and au and of gdagmg is shown , which undergo a transition to a ferromagnetic order at @xmath44k , @xmath45k , and @xmath46k , respectively .",
    "with increasing magnetic field we find a suppression of @xmath28 , which is most pronounced in the temperature range around @xmath47 .",
    "again we show @xmath48 in the insets of figure[rhofm ] . in a field of 14 t",
    "the maximum values of @xmath33 range from about -55% for gdagmg to about -25% for euaumg at the respective @xmath47 .",
    "whereas for higher temperature @xmath33 continuously approaches zero , we observe a sign change for eu@xmath8 mg below @xmath47 . around",
    "5k @xmath33 reaches up to + 20% and + 15% for @xmath49 and au , respectively .",
    "for gdagmg such a sign change is not observed , but from the steep slope of @xmath33 at 2k we suspect that it will also occur at somewhat lower temperature .",
    "qualitatively , the behavior of @xmath33 can be explained as follows : at the lowest temperature the magnetic moments are almost completely ordered and the ( magneto-)resistance of the ferromagnetic @xmath0 mg is comparable to that of the paramagnetic yb@xmath8 mg with respect to both , the absolute value @xmath50 and the increase in a magnetic field",
    ". with increasing temperature ferromagnetic spin waves are excited and the spontaneous magnetization decreases .",
    "therefore , the charge carriers may be scattered by magnetic excitations and as a consequence @xmath51 ( in zero field ) increases much faster for the ferromagnets than for the paramagnets .",
    "the strongest increase of @xmath51 occurs close to @xmath47 .",
    "although this scattering is present in the ferromagnets above @xmath47 , the difference between @xmath51 of the ferromagnets and the paramagnets decreases with further increasing temperature , since for higher temperature scattering by phonons becomes more and more dominant and one may expect that the scattering by phonons is not too different for the various compounds . in the temperature range around @xmath47",
    "the magnetization strongly increases with increasing magnetic field .",
    "thus , the magnetic scattering of charge carriers can be effectively suppressed in that temperature range because the localized moments become aligned by increasing the magnetic field . with further increasing temperature thermal fluctuations increase .",
    "thus the large negative magnetoresistance decreases again , because the influence of the magnetic field on the magnetization decreases .",
    "note that laagmg does not fit into this explanation , since its @xmath52 is much larger than @xmath28 of the isostructural - structural gd@xmath8 mg .",
    "it remains to be clarified why @xmath28 of laagmg is so large although there is no magnetic scattering present .",
    "resistivity of antiferromagnetic gdauin and gdaumg for different magnetic fields ( increasing field strength is indicated by the arrows ) .",
    "the insets show the magnetoresistance @xmath32/\\rho(h=0)$].,scaledwidth=87.0% ]    figure[rhoafm ] displays the resistivity of gdauin and gdaumg , which order antiferromagnetically at @xmath53k and @xmath54k , respectively .",
    "again we observe a negative magnetoresistance in the temperature range around the ordering temperature which can be traced back to the suppression of magnetic fluctuations in a magnetic field .",
    "compared to the ferromagnetic compound , this effect is , however , much less pronounced because the magnetic field tends to align the magnetic moments parallel whereas the exchange favors an antiparallel alignment .",
    "despite the large absolute values of @xmath52 of gdauin its magnetoresistance is rather strong . from the low @xmath55 of this compound",
    "we conclude that the antiferromagnetic coupling is rather weak and the field has a strong influence .",
    "for example , @xmath55 strongly shifts towards lower temperature with increasing field and it seems that the enhanced resistivity due to magnetic fluctuations around @xmath55 can be almost completely suppressed in 14 t .",
    "we also observe a sign change of @xmath33 with decreasing temperature , but at the lowest temperature @xmath28 does not monotonously increase with field , in contrast to the other @xmath0 mg compounds ( see figures[rhopm ] and[rhofm ] ) .",
    "we think that this more complex behavior arises from the interplay of the antiferromagnetic coupling and the strong magnetic field which both suppress magnetic fluctuations but also act against each other . a more detailed study down to lower temperature and to higher magnetic fields is currently underway and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "since gdaumg has the highest ordering temperature of all the compounds studied , it will also have the strongest ( antiferromagnetic ) coupling .",
    "consequently , its magnetoresistance is rather weak even in a field of 14 t .",
    "again , there is a sign change of @xmath33 below @xmath55 .",
    "however , around @xmath56k @xmath33 shows a sharp kink and a sign change of its slope .",
    "this kink of @xmath33 is present for all fields since it arises from a tiny kink of the zero - field @xmath51 curve at @xmath45k , whereas the @xmath51 curves for larger fields do not show such an anomaly .",
    "additional anomalies also occur in our dc magnetization data below about 50k and have been observed in ac susceptibility measurements.@xcite the additional anomalies in ac susceptibility are most pronounced at 19k and have been interpreted as evidence for a transition to a canted antiferromagnetic phase at 19k .",
    "thus , one may speculate whether the kink in the zero - field @xmath51 curve is related to a precursor of such a spin - reorientation .       specific heat of @xmath0 mg and gdauin as a function of temperature . in both panels the curves",
    "are shifted by 12.5j / molek with respect to each other for the different compounds as it is indicated by the arrows.,scaledwidth=87.0% ]    in figure[cp ] we summarize the results of our specific heat measurements for all compounds .",
    "as one may expect , the paramagnets ( ybagmg , ybaumg , and laagmg ) show rather similar @xmath57 curves without any anomalies , since there are no phase transitions ( neither structural nor magnetic ones).@xcite the ferromagnets eu@xmath8 mg ( @xmath49 , au ) and the antiferromagnets gdmg@xmath58 ( @xmath59 , in ) show well - defined anomalies at the respective curie and nel temperatures , respectively .",
    "in all four cases the anomaly shape is typical for a ( mean - field ) second - order phase transition without strong fluctuations . above the respective ordering temperature",
    "the @xmath57 curves are again very similar to each other and to those of the paramagnets .",
    "a clearly different behaviour is observed for gdagmg . here",
    ", the anomaly of @xmath60 at @xmath61k is very narrow and much higher than in the other compounds .",
    "this anomaly resembles more the @xmath62-shape of a second - order phase transition with strong fluctuations or to a broadened @xmath63-anomaly of a weakly first - order phase transition .",
    "in addition , there is another clear anomaly of @xmath57 around 125k , whose shape is again typical for a mean - field second - order phase transition .    in order to further investigate the origin of these anomalies",
    "we analyze the change of ( magnetic ) entropy at the respective phase transitions . for both , the eu and the gd compounds we expect that the magnetic entropy will be dominated by the half - filled @xmath36 shells with @xmath3 of eu@xmath5 or gd@xmath6 . in addition , there may be an additional contribution from a partial polarization of the @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 valence bands , but this will be much smaller than the @xmath36 contribution of @xmath67j / molek ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote avogadro s and boltzmann s constant , respectively ) .",
    "we assume that the total entropy consists of the sum of magnetic , phononic and electronic contributions , i.e. @xmath70    in order to separate the magnetic ( @xmath71 ) from the sum of the phononic ( @xmath72 ) and the electronic contribution ( @xmath73 ) we estimate @xmath74 of the ( anti-)ferromagnetic compounds by using the measured @xmath57 of the isostructural paramagnets , for which @xmath75 . as a typical example , we show the analysis for euaumg in the right panel of figure[smag ] , where @xmath57 of ybaumg has been used to estimate @xmath76 of euaumg . for this estimate",
    "we rescale the temperature axis of @xmath77 until it agrees to the measured @xmath78 in the temperature range above @xmath47 . in this particular case",
    "a 6% rescaling @xmath79 causes a very good agreement up to the highest temperature ( even at 300k the curves deviate by less than 1% ) .",
    "the entropy change due the phase transition is then calculated from the difference @xmath80 via integration @xmath81 . in all cases",
    "the integration constant has been chosen such that above the phase transition @xmath82j / molek is reached as it is expected for an @xmath3 system .     left : specific heat of @xmath7agmg for magnetically ordering @xmath83 , gd and for paramagnetic @xmath26 , la .",
    "for the paramagnets the temperature has been rescaled ( the factors @xmath84 are given in the brackets ) in such a way that the @xmath85 curves allow to estimate the phononic contributions @xmath76 for @xmath83 and gd .",
    "right : entropy changes due to the phase transitions obtained via an integration of the differences @xmath86/t$ ] for the different compounds . as expected for the half - filled @xmath36 shell the magnetic entropy @xmath87 with @xmath3",
    "is approached in most cases ( lines ) . for gdagmg ( symbols )",
    "this is , however , only the case when the entropy changes due to both transitions are considered ( see text).,scaledwidth=87.0% ]    the right panel of figure[smag ] shows the calculated entropy changes .",
    "we find that @xmath88 strongly decreases below the ordering temperature and roughly approaches zero for vanishing temperature for all compounds except for gdagmg .",
    "this is clear evidence that the magnetic phase transitions can be viewed as an ordering of a system with localized @xmath3 moments . in other words , the hybridization of the @xmath36 states with the valence bands and/or a polarization of the valence bands hardly influence @xmath89 . for gdagmg",
    "the situation is more complex . here , the entropy change connected with the proposed magnetic ordering at @xmath90k amounts only to about 50% of the expected @xmath91j / molek . in the right panel of figure[smag ] this is shown by the open symbols , which are obtained when we estimate the phononic background @xmath92 by scaling @xmath93 such that it coincides with the measured @xmath94 above about 40k ( see upper curves in the left panel of figure[smag ] ) .",
    "however , it is also possible to scale @xmath93 such that it fits the measured @xmath94 only above the upper transition , i.e.  above about 130k . in this case",
    "the difference between both curves yields the sum of the entropy changes due to both transition .",
    "as it is shown by the full symbols in the right panel of figure[smag ] the total entropy change is again close to the expected @xmath82j / molek .",
    "this indicates that for gdagmg a partial ordering of the magnetic moments sets in already below @xmath95k and the complete ordering is obtained only below @xmath96k .",
    "we have also performed dc magnetization measurements as a function of temperature on that sample , but we could not resolve any anomaly around 125k .",
    "however , some small additional features , which start below about 120k , have been observed in ac susceptibility measurements.@xcite     left : specific heat in zero (  ) and a finite magnetic field ( @xmath97 ) of 5 t ( euagmg ) or 10 t ( gdauin and gdaumg ) .",
    "for clarity the curves of the different compounds are shifted with respect to each other .",
    "right : differential magnetocaloric effect @xmath98 of the different compounds for various magnetic - field strengths ( see text).,scaledwidth=87.0% ]    the specific heat of the paramagnetic la- and yb - based compounds does not show any measurable magnetic - field dependence .",
    "for the antiferromagnetic materials gdauin and gdaumg the specific - heat anomaly is systematically shifted towards lower temperature with increasing field . as shown in the right panel of figure[mke ] , @xmath55 decreases from @xmath99k to @xmath100k for gdauin in a field of 14 t , and from @xmath101k to @xmath102k for gdaumg . in figure[mke ] we also present the magnetic - field influence on @xmath60 for the ferromagnet euagmg . here ,",
    "the transition is almost completely smeared out already in a field of 5 t .",
    "this is typical for ferromagnets because larger fields cause a strong magnetization already well above the zero - field @xmath47 and the magnetization does not develop spontaneously below a critical temperature anymore . strictly speaking",
    ", a ferromagnetic transition temperature can only be defined for zero magnetic field .",
    "the strong magnetic - field influence on @xmath60 around the transition temperature means that the ( magnetic ) entropy is strongly field dependent .",
    "thus , these materials are of potential interest with respect for cooling or heating by adiabatic ( de-)magnetization .",
    "usually only the magnetic entropy is magnetic - field dependent and for an effective cooling @xmath89 should therefore be large , which is the case in our samples due to the large spin of 7/2 of the half - filled @xmath36 shell .",
    "the magnetocaloric effect , i.e.the magnetic - field induced variation of the sample temperature under adiabatic conditions , can be either directly measured or it can be calculated from measurements of specific heat and magnetization via the thermodynamic relation @xmath103 equation[mke ] yields an expression for the differential magnetocaloric effect @xmath104 as a function of temperature for a fixed magnetic field and the field - induced temperature change @xmath105 can be obtained by numerical calculation from measurements in constant magnetic fields with @xmath106 .",
    "the upper right panel of figure[mke ] shows the differential magnetocaloric effect of the antiferromagnetic compounds . in a field of 5 t",
    "we find for gdauin a small positive @xmath107k / t above and @xmath108k / t below @xmath55 , and @xmath104 vanishes towards both , higher and lower temperatures .",
    "this behavior is expected via equation  [ mke ] from the typical behavior of an antiferromagnet .",
    "with decreasing temperature @xmath109 increases according to a curie - weiss law and @xmath60 decreases .",
    "both effects cause an increase of @xmath104 until @xmath55 is reached . for low fields",
    "the magnetization usually changes its slope at @xmath55 , and @xmath110 its sign . for @xmath111k",
    "the magnetization usually approaches a constant value , i.e.  @xmath104 is expected to vanish . for fields lower than 5 t",
    "the temperature dependencies of the @xmath112 curves are very similar to that of @xmath113 in @xmath114 t .",
    "however , the absolute values of @xmath112 are reduced , because in low fields the magnetization of an antiferromagnet is roughly proportional to the applied field , whereas @xmath115 does not change too much .",
    "therefore , the proportionality @xmath116 is roughly fulfilled for @xmath117 t . for higher fields the maximum of @xmath104 further increases , but @xmath104 remains positive , because the sign change of @xmath118 is suppressed in large enough fields .",
    "for example , a field of 14 t causes a low - temperature magnetization of more than 80% of the saturation moment of 7@xmath119/f.u .",
    "of the half - filled @xmath36 shell .",
    "for gdaumg one would expect a qualitatively similar behavior as observed in gdauin , but with smaller absolute values of @xmath110 due to the larger @xmath55 .",
    "this is , however , not the case .",
    "the main difference is that @xmath110 only shows a step - like decrease close to @xmath55 , whereas the sign change occurs about 10 to 15k below @xmath55 .",
    "this more complex behavior points towards a magnetic - field dependent reorientation of the magnetic moments .",
    "as already mentioned above , evidence for such a behavior has also been found from measurements of low - field ac susceptibility and mssbauer spectroscopy.@xcite    the lower right panel displays the differential magnetocaloric effect for ferromagnetic euagmg . in the lowest field of 50mt",
    "we find a very sharp peak with @xmath120k / t , which is located close to the zero - field @xmath47 .",
    "with increasing field the peak rapidly decreases in height and strongly broadens .",
    "for example , @xmath110 lies between 0.6 and 0.7k / t over a temperature range from about 10 to 40k in a field of 5 t .",
    "such a behavior is typical for a ferromagnet because the transition strongly smears out with increasing field . due to the large spin",
    "the magnetocaloric effect of euagmg is relatively large .",
    "however , larger effects are found e.g.  in some @xmath121 compounds with @xmath122 , ho , er and @xmath123 , ni , al . here",
    ", larger magnetic entropy changes occur due to the larger @xmath124 values of @xmath125 , additional crystalline electric field effects , and contributions from magnetic co.@xcite moreover , a so - called giant magnetocaloric effect observed in gd@xmath126(si@xmath127ge@xmath127 ) has attracted a lot of attention.@xcite this giant magnetocaloric effect is related to a second - order transition from a para- to a ferromagnetic(i ) state , which then transforms via a first - order transition to a ferromagnetic(i ) state .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of the resistance and the specific heat as a function of temperature ( @xmath128 ) and magnetic field ( up to 14 t ) on a series of rare - earth ( @xmath129 ) transition - metal @xmath130 mg compounds @xmath0 mg and on gdauin . for @xmath1 ( yb )",
    "the @xmath36 shell is empty ( filled ) and the respective compounds are paramagnetic metals , whereas the eu- and gd - based materials show ferro- or antiferromagnetic ordering arising from the half - filled @xmath36 shell of eu@xmath5 or gd@xmath6 .",
    "all compounds show a metallic resistivity , but the absolute values of @xmath28 vary over three orders of magnitude from a few @xmath131 cm in ybaumg to @xmath132 cm in gdauin . the absolute value of @xmath28 increases with increasing number of valence electrons , what may arise from the different crystal structures of the di- ( yb , eu ) and trivalent ( la , gd ) @xmath7-based compounds .",
    "both , the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic ordering causes an abrupt decrease of @xmath28 below the respective curie- and nel - temperature , because the scattering of charge carriers on magnetic excitations freezes out in the ordered phase . for the ferromagnets",
    "we find a large negative magnetoresistance , which is most pronounced close to @xmath47 , where a decrease of @xmath28 of order -5%/t is observed for fields below 5 t .",
    "as expected , a significantly smaller decrease of @xmath28 ( of order -0.2%/t ) is found for the antiferromagnets close to @xmath55 . with decreasing temperature",
    "the magnetoresistance becomes weaker and for most of the magnetically ordered compounds it is positive at the lowest temperature and comparable to the positive magnetoresistance of the paramagnets .",
    "for all ferro- and antiferromagnetic compounds",
    "the magnetic ordering causes well - defined anomalies in the specific heat .",
    "our analysis of the related entropy change clearly shows that the magnetic transitions are well described by an ordering of localized @xmath3 moments of the half - filled @xmath36 shell of eu@xmath5 or gd@xmath6 .",
    "additional effects , e.g. from a polarization of the valence bands or a hybridization between 4f states and the valence bands , play a minor role .",
    "however , for gdagmg we find clear evidence for two transitions at 125 and 39k . in susceptibility measurements a sizeable spontaneous magnetization is only found below 39k , but the entropy change due to this transition is only about half as large as expected for an @xmath3 system .",
    "the expected magnetic entropy change is achieved when the sum of the entropy changes due to both transitions is considered .",

    "this more complex behavior of gdagmg is not yet understood and deserves further investigations . for both , the ferro- and the antiferromagnetic compounds we observe a sizeable magnetocaloric effect @xmath110 , which is most pronounced for the ferromagnets in low fields and close to @xmath47 . for euagmg a relatively large @xmath133k / t is present over a large field and temperature range , but this value still remains well below those observed in various other rare - earth based materials .",

    "this anomaly is suppressed in a magnetic field of 3 t and most probably arises from a small amount of an impurity phase of yb@xmath127o@xmath134 ."
