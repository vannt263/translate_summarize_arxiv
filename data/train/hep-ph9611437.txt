    "supersymmetric models with a light gravitino ( @xmath9 ) have been considered for some time @xcite , but interest on them has recently surged @xcite because of their ability to explain naturally the puzzling @xmath10 event observed by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "if the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , may occur at an unsuppressed rate @xcite . ]",
    "the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp , typically the lightest neutralino ( @xmath11 ) , as we will assume here ) becomes unstable and eventually decays into a photon plus a gravitino ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "this decay becomes of experimental interest when it happens quickly enough for the photon to be observed in the detector .",
    "because the interaction of the gravitino with matter is inversely proportional to the gravitino mass , the neutralino lifetime will be short enough for a sufficiently light gravitino : @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the gravitino may not be too light , as otherwise it would be copiously produced leading to distinctive signals at colliders that have not been observed @xcite or cosmological @xcite and astrophysical @xcite embarrassments : @xmath13 .",
    "lep  1 searches strengthen this limit to @xmath14 in large regions of parameter space , when @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "theoretically , light gravitinos are expected in gauge - mediated models of low - energy supersymmetry @xcite , where the gravitino mass is related to the scale of supersymmetry breaking via @xmath16 .",
    "special cases of gravity - mediated models may also yield light gravitinos , when the scale of local and global breaking of supersymmetry are decoupled , as in the context of no - scale supergravity @xcite , in which case @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the gaugino mass scale and @xmath19 a model - dependent constant",
    ".    experimental searches for supersymmetry are considerably more sensitive in this type of neutralino - unstable supersymmetric models .",
    "first of all , the lightest observable supersymmetric channel is no longer a pair of charginos ( @xmath20 ) , but instead a pair of ( the usually lighter ) neutralinos ( @xmath21 ) , or if the gravitino is light enough ( @xmath22 ) the neutralino - gravitino channel ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "these new channels allow a deeper exploration into parameter space . furthermore , because of the photonic signature in all supersymmetric processes , it becomes possible to overcome the loss of experimental sensitivity that occurs when the daughter leptons become too soft ( as in chargino pair production when @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) , and therefore absolute lower bounds on sparticle masses become experimentally attainable in this class of models .",
    "indeed , diphoton searches at lep161 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath26 ) @xcite have been recently shown @xcite to exclude a significant fraction of the parameter space that is preferred by the supersymmetric interpretations of the cdf event .",

    "the resulting single - photon signal has been recently shown to be observable at lep  2 in certain range of gravitino masses , but only when the diphoton signal from neutralino pair production is itself not kinematically accessible @xcite .",
    "therefore , experimental observation of whichever photonic signal will provide very useful information in sorting out the various light - gravitino scenarios in the literature .",
    "the gravitino mass plays a central role in gravitino - production processes , whose rate is inversely proportional to the gravitino mass squared ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "in contrast , the precise value of the gravitino mass plays a minor role in the production of the traditional supersymmetric particles , as it determines only the decay length of the neutralino .",
    "the neutralino - gravitino process of interest at lep is @xmath31 which provides an experimental handle on the gravitino mass .",
    "this process was considered originally by fayet @xcite ( in the restricted case of a very light photino - like neutralino ) who noted that the @xmath32 threshold behavior in eq .",
    "( [ eq : process ] ) results from subtle cancellations among all contributing amplitudes .",

    ", this process was revisited in the restricted case of a neutralino with a non - negligible zino component , where the resonant @xmath35-exchange diagram dominates @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we first calculate the cross section for the @xmath27 process at arbitrary center - of - mass energies and give new analytic expressions for the corresponding differential cross section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cross ] ) .",
    "next we reassess the constraints on the gravitino mass in view of the full lep  1 data set and imposing the preliminary limits obtained recently from runs at lep161 ( @xmath26 ) , for general neutralino compositions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] )",
    ". we also comment on the potential of analogous searches at the tevatron .",

    "[ sec : signal ] ) , and also discuss the missing invariant mass distribution expected in the events .",
    "we show that one may evade the lep  1 limits and still obtain observable single - photon signals at lep  2 , although only when the diphoton signal from neutralino pair production is kinematically inaccessible . finally we specialize our results to the case of our proposed one - parameter no - scale supergravity model @xcite ( sec .",

    "the couplings of the neutralino ( photino : @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) to matter are very simple : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 where @xmath70    with this relatively simple expression we can verify certain expected behaviors of the cross section .",

    "a related manifestation of this phenomenon can be exposed by studying the threshold behavior of the cross section .",
    "the spin-@xmath46 ( goldstino ) component of the gravitino is essentially obtained by taking the derivative of the full gravitino field , thus making the goldstino couplings be proportional to the goldstino momentum ( @xmath75 ) . at threshold @xmath76 and",

    "as we expect neutralino - gravitino production to be allowed only for @xmath113 ( to avoid the stringent lep  1 lower limits on @xmath129 ) , we concentrate on the following three neutralino mass choices : @xmath164 . to gain some insight into the final distributions ,",
    "we start by displaying the normalized neutralino angular distributions @xmath162 as a function of @xmath165 for @xmath166 , and bino ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thetachi.bino ] ) , zino ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thetachi.zino ] ) , and photino ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thetachi.photino ] ) neutralino compositions .",
    "the total cross sections for each of the curves can be read off fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma190 ] and for convenience have been tabulated in table  [ table1 ] . as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : thetachi.bino ] , [ fig : thetachi.zino ] , and [ fig : thetachi.photino ] , the angular distribution varies quite a bit with neutralino mass , although mostly for light selectron masses .",
    "note that the angular distributions always remain finite , and generally show a preference for the central region .",
    ".total cross sections corresponding to the differential cross sections shown in figs .",
    "6,7,8 at lep190 .",
    "all masses in gev , all cross sections in pb . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ' '' ''      the observable photonic energy and angular distributions can be quite unwieldly once we allow for the many choices of parameters that we have considered above .",
    "an examination of all parameter combinations shows that both energy and angular distributions are largely insensitive to the neutralino composition , being much more sensitive to the mass parameters ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath167 ) .",
    "this result is perhaps not surprising as the observable distributions of relativistic particles are dominated by kinematical effects which depend crucially on the mass parameters .",
    "thus , for brevity we show only the result in the bino case which , in any event , is representative of typical supergravity models .",
    "the energy ( @xmath36 ) and angular ( @xmath37 ) distributions for @xmath164 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebins ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cbins ] respectively , for @xmath166 .    the energy distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ebins ] ) show a significant @xmath108 and @xmath89 dependence .",
    "as the neutralino mass grows , it tends to produce harder photons .",
    "in fact , it is not hard to show that in the decay @xmath1 , with a neutralino energy and momentum as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epchi ] ) , the photon energy is restricted to the interval @xmath168 as faithfully reproduced in the simulations .",
    "( near threshold ( @xmath169 ) the photon carries away half of the center - of - mass energy . )",
    "these distributions show that any given single - photon candidate energy ( @xmath36 ) implies an upper bound on the possible neutralino masses consistent with the candidate event , @xmath170    the photonic angular distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cbins ] ) are peaked in the forward and backward directions , even more so as the neutralino becomes heavier .",
    "the selectron mass has an interesting effect . in the case of @xmath171 , from fig .",
    "[ fig : thetachi.bino ] we see that for heavy selectron masses the neutralino angular distribution is fairly flat , and therefore the photonic distributions should reflect only kinematical effects , as they do ( _ i.e. _ , peaked in the forward and backward directions ) . for light selectron masses , the neutralino avoids the forward and backward directions , and the kinematical effect on the photons is diminished .",
    "the dominant background to the neutralino - gravitino signal is single radiative return to the @xmath35 : @xmath172 , where the photon is radiated off the initial state and the @xmath35 boson tends to be on shell .",
    "the most distinctive signature for this background process appears in the missing invariant mass @xmath173 distribution , which is strongly peaked at @xmath174 .",
    "the missing mass distribution for the signal can be easily determined , as in this case the missing energy and missing momentum are given by @xmath175 and therefore @xmath176 the allowed range of @xmath177 is obtained by inserting the range of photonic energies in eq .",
    "( [ eq : egamma ] ) ; we obtain @xmath178 histograms showing missing mass distributions fall in the range specified by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmissrange ] ) , and otherwise favor the upper end of the @xmath177 range ( corresponding to the lower end of the photonic energy range ) . for brevity , we display these distributions only in the one - parameter model example discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : models ] below .",
    "we note in passing that the complementary diphoton events from neutralino pair - production have a background ( @xmath179 ) that also peaks for @xmath174 @xcite . in this case",
    "the missing mass in the diphoton signal varies from zero up to a maximum value of @xmath180 , in contrast with the result for the single - photon signal in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmissrange ] ) .",
    "the @xmath177 distributions of the single - photon and diphoton signals differ not only in range , but also in shape .",
    "it should have become clear from the discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : signal ] , that the signals to be searched for experimentally can have a wide range of characteristics because of the variations in the underlying parameters describing the neutralino - gravitino process .",
    "in reality , the model of supersymmetry that describes nature will have all its mass parameters correlated in some way , and the actual observations may be a bewildering composite of the many curves shown above . to exemplify this situation , in this section we specialize our results to the case of the one - parameter no - scale supergravity model that has been mentioned at various places in the preceding discussion .",
    "we have already shown the corresponding single - photon cross sections at lep  1 , lep161 , and lep190 , as the dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : sigmamz],[fig : sigma161],[fig : sigma190 ] respectively .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath44 show a peculiar bump that , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lep161 ] , can be traced back to the fact that the selectron masses vary with the neutralino mass .    as a first step towards obtaining the angular and energy photonic distributions , in fig .",
    "[ fig : thetachilnz ] we show the normalized neutralino angular distributions @xmath162 for @xmath163 and @xmath181 .",
    "the total cross sections in each of these cases are @xmath182 .",
    "note how relatively flat the angular distributions are : no more than a 10% variation .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the wide range of variability observed in the generic cases shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : thetachi.bino ] , [ fig : thetachi.zino ] , and [ fig : thetachi.photino ] .",
    "in fact , the results in the one - parameter model resemble those in the generic models when the selectron mass is large ( _ i.e. _ , the dotted lines in those figures , which correspond to @xmath183 ) .",
    "this is to be expected as in the one - parameter model one has @xmath109 , indicating increasingly heavier selectrons .    following the method outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : signal ] , in figs .",
    "[ fig : ebinslnz ] and [ fig : cbinslnz ] we display the photonic energy and angular distributions at lep190 for three representative neutralino masses ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the energy distributions show the same restrictive photon energy behavior as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : egamma ] ) .",
    "the angular distributions are also peaked in the forward and backward directions .",
    "finally we consider the missing mass distributions , which are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmiss ] ) , and are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mbinslnz ] .",
    "we note the range of @xmath177 , as prescribed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmissrange ] ) , and the tendency to favor missing mass values toward the upper end of the allowed interval . for the neutralino mass choices shown",
    ", the missing mass shows a distinct preference to be larger than @xmath118 .",
    "( this is in contrast with the @xmath177 distribution in diphoton events , which is more evenly distributed . )",
    "in this paper we have attempted to study in some detail the physics of supersymmetric models with a gravitino light enough that it can be produced directly at collider experiments .",
    "our discussion has centered mainly around lep , from where the strongest constraints can be obtained at the moment . we have nonetheless outlined the corresponding program to be followed at the tevatron , where instrumental backgrounds make identification of the single - photon signal a more challenging task .",
    "we have provided new and explicitly analytical expressions for neutralino - gravitino differential cross sections at @xmath185 colliders and have discussed some of the theoretical subtleties involved in the calculation and some of the peculiar parameter dependences of the cross section .",
    "we have used our expressions to obtain new lower bounds from lep  1 data on the gravitino mass for @xmath15 .",
    "weaker limits from lep  2 are obtained at higher neutralino masses .",
    "our study includes a monte carlo simulation of the single - photon signal , which should be helpful in the experimental analyses that are just now getting underway .",
    "we have also specialized the results to our one - parameter no - scale supergravity model , where the signals can be analyzed much more simply because of the tight correlations between the model parameters .",
