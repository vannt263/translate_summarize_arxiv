    "in earlier studies of polydisperse system it has been established that homogeneous crystallization never takes place above an upper limit of the polydispersity , known as terminal polydispersity  @xcite .",
    "recently , an application of density functional theory ( dft ) theory of freezing  @xcite of hard sphere fluid by chaudhuri et al . found a terminal polydispersity of 0.048 , followed by a reentrant melting at larger density  @xcite .",
    "several studies showed the existence of terminal polydispersity as well as reentrant melting  @xcite on hard sphere polydisperse systems .",
    "experimental studies , however , observed a nearly universal value of 0.12 for the terminal polydispersity  @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical and experimental techniques have been utilized to understand freezing / melting transition  @xcite .",
    "although an analytical study of phase transition of polydisperse system is challenging , there have been a number of studies on fluid - fluid and the fluid - solid transition  @xcite . both the freezing and melting transition of polydisperse colloidal system have been examined by lwen et al  @xcite .",
    "a series of molecular - dynamics calculations has been carried out to examine melting in the classical gaussian core model  @xcite .    in the melting of solids when molecules / atoms interact with each other via a central potential ,",
    "two empirical criteria have been used extensively to predict transitions . from the melting side one uses the lindemann criterion  @xcite which states that at melting temperature , the root mean square displacement exceeds 0.1 of the cell length . the second criterion is the hansen - verlet rule of crystallization  @xcite that requires the value of the first peak of static structure factor @xmath0 to exceed 2.85 for freezing . both these simple criteria are found to hold good for different types of interactions and hence these criteria are considered universal .",
    "lindemann criteria of melting can be investigated using lattice dynamical theory . on the other hand , justification of the hansen - verlet rule of crystallization",
    "comes from the density functional theory of freezing  @xcite .",
    "these theories have also been used to understand metastability and nucleation in the liquid - solid phase transition of the polydisperse system .    in the present work",
    "we apply both theory and computer simulation to establish a relationship between integral equation theory of freezing and terminal polydispersity during the first order liquid - solid phase transition in polydisperse lennard - jones spheres . the inherent structure analysis  @xcite further enlightens the understanding of the relationship between transition and stability of the solid .",
    "integral equation based theoretical analysis of freezing transition has been a subject of great interest for many years .",
    "the most successful theory of freezing , the ramakrishnan - yussouff theory  @xcite is also based , at the core , on integral equations that relate the inhomogeneous single particle density to two particle direct correlation function , _",
    "c(r)_. this theory employs an expansion of density in a fourier series where order parameters are the density evaluated at the reciprocal lattice vector components .",
    "the resulting equations are solved along with the thermodynamics conditions of equality of chemical potential and equality of pressure .",
    "in fact , relationship between solutions of integral equation theories and liquid - solid transition has been investigated extensively .",
    "many of the previous studies focused on the limiting liquid density beyond which liquid becomes unstable with respect to periodic density waves of the solid .",
    "in the analysis of lovett  @xcite , this instability point was identified as @xmath1 .",
    "similar conclusion was reached by munakata _",
    "@xcite in an interesting approach using the correct non - linear integral theories .",
    "et al _ built on these previous analyses , but made the analysis robust by using proper order parameters . in the analysis of rice _",
    "@xcite , @xmath2is identified as the limit of instability or spinodal point , where @xmath3 , with @xmath4as the density of the emerging solid phase .",
    "in addition , enormous theoretical approaches are used to describe the freezing transition directly in terms of the bifurcation of solutions for single density from the homogeneous liquid branch to inhomogeneous branch .",
    "this approach also applies essentially the same integral equation that relates the inhomogeneous singlet density to the pair direct correlation function  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a terminal point in the bifurcation diagram is achieved where the density of the liquid phase is close to the dense random close packed state of the hard sphere liquid and the density of the solid phase is close to crystal closed packed values  @xcite .",
    "this point can be interpreted as the signature of the end of possible compression in the system .    in the elegant approach of the theory of freezing by ramakrishnan and yussouff  @xcite ,",
    "thermodynamic potential of the system is computed as a function of the order parameters proportionl to the periodic lattice components of the singlet density .",
    "this theory employs a nearly exact expression for inhomogeneous density field derived from the density functional theory of statistical mechanics .",
    "free energy is expressed in terms of density fluctuations around the bulk liquid density with n - particle direct correlation functions as the expansion coefficients , as elaborated below .",
    "in accordance with the density functional theory of freezing , the density of inhomogeneous solid can be expressed in terms of order parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the following fashion @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the inhomogeneous solid density , @xmath9 is the liquid density and @xmath10 is the set of reciprocal lattice vectors of the chosen lattice .",
    "the order parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the expansion coefficients of the inhomogeneous solid density , defined quantitatively below .",
    "these quantities can be quantified in the following fashion , @xmath11 where integration is over the lattice cell of volume @xmath12 fractional density change @xmath5 in the transition can clearly be written as @xmath13 .",
    "structural order parameters @xmath14 can be obtained by solving the following integral equations as , @xmath15 one can introduce a scaling transformation that brings out an interesting generality of the freezing theory as , @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 therefore , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are both dimensionless quantities .",
    "@xmath21 is the fourier transform of the pair direct correlation function , evaluated at @xmath22 .",
    "the above transformations lead to the following expression @xmath23 @xmath24 } { \\int _ { \\delta } d\\vec{r}_{1 } \\exp                         \\left[\\sum _ { \\vec{g}}\\psi _ { \\vec{g } } \\lambda _ { \\vec{g } }   \\xi _ { \\vec{g } } \\left(\\vec{r}_{1 } \\right)\\right ] } .\\ ] ] here @xmath25 is the n - th reciprocal lattice vector , @xmath26is the periodic density wave corresponds to the set of @xmath10 that has the same magnitude .",
    "so , @xmath27 note that eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] has a quasi - universal character , as noted by rice _",
    "@xcite . equation  [ eq7 ] does not require any information about direct correlation function or density of the liquid and the solid phases .",

    "[ eq7 ] can also be derived by combining equations of ramakrishnan - yussouff and of haymet - oxtoby ( see eq .",
    "[ eq9 ] below ) .",
    "the scaling transformation allows one to solve for @xmath20 as a function of @xmath19without requiring the input of direct correlation function , and the functional form has an interesting character as shown below .    using the density functional theory",
    ", one can obtain the following expression of the grand canonical potential difference between solid and liquid as , @xmath29    @xmath30 is the second thermodynamic condition of freezing . since @xmath5and @xmath14",
    "are all positive , @xmath31 can be zero only if @xmath32 is compensated by @xmath33 .",
    "the above expressions are all for one component liquid . however , as shown by chaudhuri _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the same expression may be used with an effective @xmath34 and effective @xmath21 .",
    "the order parameters themselves can be determined by a set of non - linear equations , as shown by rice _",
    "et al . _",
    "interestingly , in many earlier studies the approach of @xmath35 to unity was considered as the limit of stability of the liquid towards freezing . a different approach was adopted by rice _",

    "the two end points denote two limits of stability .",
    "the first terminal point gives the limit of stability of the solid , as discussed here , and is connected to terminal solid density .",
    "the second terminal point at @xmath39 gives the limit of stability as discussed earlier by rice _",
    "et al_. and even earlier by lovett  @xcite.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the scaled phase diagram with scaled variables is shown in fig .",
    "note this diagram shows a curious character .",
    "the scaled phase diagram is just like a van der waals loop with terminal points that may be identified as the two spinodal points of the solid - liquid phase transition .",
    "the first turn is the one that corresponds to the limit of stability of the solid , the second turn at larger density should correspond to the limit of stability of the liquid .",
    "maxwell tie line ( given by@xmath30 ) is constructed to find coexistence under a given thermodynamic condition .",
    "this enforces the additional thermodynamic condition of equality of pressure between the fluid and the solid branches .",
    "[ eq7 ] and hence the scaled phase diagram have been obtained under the assumption of equality of chemical potential between the liquid and solid phases .",
    "coexistence is found by imposing equality of grand thermodynamic potential ( see eq .",
    "[ eq9 ] ) .    along x axis",
    ", @xmath19 can correspond to multitudes of @xmath4 and @xmath9 values within the region of scaled phase diagram .",
    "this is because @xmath19 depends intricately on both @xmath4 and @xmath9 values through direct correlation function which is evaluated with @xmath9 , but at the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath40 which depends on the solid density @xmath41equality of pressure for grand canonical ensemble picks out unique values of @xmath4 and @xmath9 .",
    "the scaled phase diagram is generated by using same chemical potential , but the condition of equality of pressure needs to be imposed to obtain the thermodynamic transition parameters .    as the polydispersity parameter @xmath42 increases , freezing shifts continuously to higher volume fraction ( and pressure ) .",
    "@xmath34 increases with density .",
    "so , fractional density change decreases to compensate for this as neither @xmath21 nor @xmath14 undergoes such sharp variation .",
    "@xmath5 decreases as @xmath43 approaches@xmath9 .",
    "there have been several discussions  @xcite that address the limit of freezing .",
    "while lovett  @xcite discusses this as a spinodal decomposition , bagchi - cerjan - rice finds this as the last point of the liquid state where the liquid can transform to solid . beyond this point",
    "no solution to integral equation theory is available .",
    "[ fig1 ] thus provides two densities of the liquid : one equilibrium transition density ( with @xmath30 ) and another terminal density which has the character of a spinodal point .",
    "given the approximate nature of treatment , it is important to compare its predictions with other estimates .",
    "we study all simulations using standard molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo ( mc ) techniques supplemented by a particle swap algorithm .",

    "both md and mc simulations have been employed in nvt , npt , and nve ensembles .",
    "the mc simulations are aided with particle swapping to enable a faster equilibration in the solid phase . in the case of nvt and nve ensembles , it is customary to monitor the volume fraction ( @xmath53 ) instead of monitoring the density of the system .",
    "the standard conjugate gradient method  @xcite has been employed to obtain the inherent structures along an md trajectory .",
    "we compute the average inherent structure ( is ) energy by varying polydispersity .",
    "mc simulations with larger system size ( 2048 particles ) are carried out to check the finite size effects and the overall physical picture remains the same upon variation of system size .",

    "the theory was the observation that the average amplitude of thermal vibrations increases with increasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "melting initiates when the amplitude of vibration becomes large enough for adjacent atoms to partly occupy the same space .",
