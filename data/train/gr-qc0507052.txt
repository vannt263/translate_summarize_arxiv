    "among the problems while precisely navigating in the interior of the solar system were the intense solar radiation pressure and modeling of the many gas - jet maneuvers .",
    "( the radiation pressure caused an outward force @xmath19th that of solar gravity when the craft antenna faced towards the sun .",
    "it varied with the spacecraft aspect . )",
    "even so , with measurements , calibrations , and models , both pioneers were successfully navigated @xcite .",
    "after 1976 small time - samples of data were periodically analyzed , to set limits on any unmodeled forces .",
    "( this was especially true for pioneer 11 which was then on its jupiter - saturn cruise . ) at",
    "first nothing was found .",
    "but when a similar analysis was done around pioneer 11 s saturn flyby , things dramatically changed .",
    "( see the first two data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] . )",
    "so people kept following pioneer 11 .",
    "they also started looking more closely at the incoming pioneer 10 data .",
    "this data taking was possible because , after their successes , an extended mission was decided upon for the pioneers @xcite .",
    "one of the programs , of course , was continued radio - science navigation .",
    "-10pt    however , these estimates were not done in as rigorous a manner as would eventually be necessary for our study of the anomaly @xcite .",
    "the raw data samples were taken by different individual analysts and put through the  stripper / vax \" @xcite to  extract \" the navigational data .",
    "each individual used their own data - editing strategy , models , etc . , and the points were generated from these results @xcite .",
    "further , the navigational data was not carefully archived .",
    "that was not really necessary then because the stripper / vax system was standard and , in any event , the anomaly was generally believed to only be a  curiosity . \"",
    "even so , by 1992 an interesting string of data - points had been obtained .",
    "they were gathered in a jpl memorandum @xcite which showed a consistent bias corresponding to an acceleration of @xmath20 cm / s@xmath2 .",
    "see figure [ fig : correlation ] .",
    "in 1994 , as part of an inquiry into how well newtonian gravity was known to work from intergalactic down to solar system scales , the pioneer data was discussed @xcite .",
    "this led to the long - term pioneer collaboration to study and understand the pioneer data then in hand as well as that which was still being received at that point @xcite .    the decision to seriously analyze  modern \" data , starting from 3 january 1987 @xcite ,",
    "was motivated by a number of factors .",
    "the first was the original concern of the community that the anomaly could well be an error in the odp navigation code of jpl .",
    "this concern was answered when the analysis was repeated on an independent code , the aerospace corporation s chasmp navigational code @xcite .",
    "( later a third code verified the anomaly @xcite . ) secondly , modern data was easily accessible in modern format .",
    "finally , and perhaps most importantly , the modern data , being from far out in the solar system , was free of many of the effects of solar system systematics @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , like solar radiation pressure and plasma effects , which would confuse the analysis .",
    "( see figure [ fig : forces ] . )    specifically , by 1980 pioneer 10 was at a distance of @xmath21 au from the sun , the acceleration contribution from solar - radiation pressure on pioneer 10 ( directed away from the sun ) had decreased to @xmath22 cm / s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , at around this distance one could unambiguously begin to look at the data for small unmodeled forces of this magnitude .",
    "therefore , the fact that the doppler navigational data began to indicate the presence of an anomaly of this order of magnitude was of more significant here .",
    "both pioneers had reached this distance of @xmath21 au from the sun by 1987 .",
    "-10pt    the data for pioneer 10 was analyzed from 3 january 1987 to 22 july 1998 ( 40 au to 70.5 au ) .",
    "however , useful doppler data continued to be received until 27 april 2002 .",
    "the data from pioneer 11 was analyzed from 5 january 1987 to 1 october 1990 ( 22.4 to 31.7 au ) , when coherent doppler data ceased to arrive .",
    "the results were first reported in 1998 @xcite .",
    "the final detailed analysis appeared in 2002 @xcite , for which the existing pioneer 10/11 doppler data from 1987.0 to 1998.5 were used @xcite .",
    "this final report extensively addressed possible sources for a systematic origin for the detected anomaly .",
    "the conclusion was that , even after all _ known _ systematics are accounted for @xcite , at distances between about 20 to 70 au from the sun there remains an unmodeled frequency drift of size determined with pioneer 10 data as described in section vi of ref .",
    "@xcite and is referenced to the downlink carrier frequency , 2.29 ghz . ) but these differences are much less that the size of the anomaly and also significantly less than the systematic error . ]",
    "@xmath23 hz / s .",
    "this drift can be interpreted as an anomalous acceleration signal of @xmath24 cm / s@xmath2 in the direction towards the sun .",
    "we emphasize _ known _ because one might suspect that there is a systematic origin to the effect , perhaps generated by the spacecraft themselves from excessive heat or propulsion gas leaks .",
    "but neither we nor others with spacecraft or navigational expertise have been able to find a convincing explanation for the anomaly @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "here we discuss the data which has and has not yet been analyzed in detail .",
    "we emphasize how the early data , especially that taken from of order 10 au of the sun , may allow significantly new insights to be obtained into the origin of the anomaly .    the original aim of the detailed analysis @xcite was to verify that the signal was indeed in the data , what ever the cause , and was not an artifact of the analysis .",
    "the attitude was @xcite ,  since both the gravitational and radiation pressure forces become so large close to the sun , the anomalous contribution close to the sun `` ( shown in figures [ fig : correlation ] and [ fig : forces ] ) ' ' is meant to represent \" only an indication that the anomaly does exist in some form closer in to the sun , but not to be a precise measurement of it .",
    "many things were going on which would tend to obstruct an analysis precise to the level of the anomaly , such as many large maneuvers .",
    "for , example , pioneer 11 encountered jupiter and then came back across the central solar system to encounter saturn .",
    "the first two pioneer 11 points were near the distances of jupiter and saturn encounters .",
    "so , effects could have been misinterpreted , for example , by imprecise modeling of maneuvers .    despite this , given that the anomaly is well - determined to be in the data at large distances @xcite , we are now at a point where we have reason to reconsider this early data and to attack it critically .",
    "an advantage of having waited until now to investigate the noisier early data is that the analyses of the later data have given lessons on how to properly handle the data , the codes , and the external systematics , such as the solar radiation , the solar plasma , and maneuvers .",
    "a difficult problem in deep - space navigation , especially with only doppler such as the pioneers , is precise 3-dimensional orbit determination .",
    "the `` line - of - sight '' component of the velocity is much more easily determined by orbit determination program codes than are the motions in the orthogonal directions .",
    "however , closer in to the earth , it becomes more feasible .",
    "a better determination can be made of just what `` in a direction _ towards _ the sun '' exactly means .",
    "if the anomaly is exactly : ( i ) in the solar direction this indicates a force originating from the sun , ( ii ) in the direction towards the earth this indicates a time signal anomaly , ( iii ) in the  velocity direction \" this indicates an inertial force or a drag force , or ( iv ) in the spin - axis direction this indicates an on - board systematic @xcite . in item ( iii ) above we put quotes around  velocity direction . \"",
    "this is because close in to the sun , especially for pioneer 11 on its trans - solar - system cruise , the orbital velocity of the dust is significant with respect to that of the the craft .",
    "therefore , for drag this direction would be the vector sum of the spacecraft and dust velocities , and care would have to be given to determining the effective area of the craft .",
    "that being said , suppose , as expected , the pioneer anomaly is due to internal systematics , most often thought to be heat",
    ". then careful analysis of the early data should show the pioneer anomaly being even larger than at later times , since the radioactive decay of the rtg power sources would be less and the electric power output from the bus would have been larger since the degradation of electric power was less .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) one might even hope to tie the decrease from early times to the two decays .",
    "in this situation , combining _ all _ the available data ( the early data , that was analyzed in detail @xcite , and the pioneer 10 data from 1998.5 up to last science contact in 2002 ) would allow the best opportunity to determine any time evolution of the anomaly . finally , the direction of the force would be along the spin - axis , even when the craft was traveling almost perpendicular to the direction towards the earth .",
    "3-dimensional orbit determination might further tie this down .",
    "suppose , on the other hand , that the values of the close - in pioneer 11 data points in figures [ fig : forces ] and [ fig : correlation ] represent a correct rough measurement , and not a problem with signal to noise .",
    "then , especially the huge error at the second data point of figure [ fig : correlation ] evaluated near saturn flyby could represent a `` turn on '' of the anomaly at saturn flyby .",
    "a possible new physics idea would be that near saturn there begins a region where there is `` dark '' matter which is causing a drag force to begin",
    ". the force would then be along the velocity vector @xcite .",
    "if the  matter \" extends interior to saturn s orbit it might not be as cleanly seen in the pioneer 11 radial analysis since it would be close to perpendicular to the sun - spacecraft direction during jupiter - saturn cruise .",
    "analyzing the earlier pioneer 11 jupiter flyby and jupiter - saturn cruse , as well as the pioneer 10 jupiter flyby would elucidate all this .",
    "a more radical new physics idea would be that the modified inertia interpretation of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) is correct @xcite .",
    "then the unbound hyperbolic trajectory would have an additional acceleration of size of the pioneer anomaly .",
    "this would be confirmed if the pioneer anomaly turned on only at saturn flyby for pioneer 11 and only at jupiter flyby for pioneer 10 . here",
    ", then , one would want to specially analyze , in as good a 3-dimensional manner as possible , the pioneer 10 data from about 1 year before to one year after jupiter flyby and the pioneer 11 data from about one year before jupiter flyby to one year after saturn flyby .    at the least ,",
    "even if the answer to the anomaly turns out to be some unknown systematic , it will still be important in the more general framework of the solar system ephemerides and also will aid in developing protocols for spacecraft design and navigation .",
    "it turns out that further insights can be gleaned from the roughly analyzed features of the early data discussed in sec .",
    "[ appear ] .",
    "the data in figure [ fig : correlation ] was plotted versus orbital radius in an attempt to find a common cause for the anomalous acceleration .",
    "although , as stated , these early acceleration points were not generated as rigorously as we might like , the odp procedures used by all , and as extracted from numerous computer printouts and summarized in @xcite , guarantee that the points are independent .",
    "they are indeed indicative of what one might find by a more rigorous analysis of the early data . in table",

    "it is not possible to rule out the pioneer anomaly as a cause of the annual variation .",
    "we simply do not know .",
    "this is a further question to be addressed by the reanalysis of the early data .",
    "it is encouraging that the late - time end points for the early anomalous acceleration data are , after the removal of the annual term , statistically consistent with our results from a careful analysis of the later data from 1987.1 to 1998.5 @xcite .",
    "in summary , understanding the pioneer anomaly , no matter what turns out to be the answer , will be of great value scientifically .",
    "even if , in the end , the anomaly is due to some systematic , understanding this will greatly aid future mission design and navigational protocols .",
    "but if the anomaly is due to some not - understood physics , the importance would be spell - binding .",
    "the scientific and public - interest benefits to the community that this program would produce could be enormous",

    "if , in the end , the data set contains over 25 years of pioneer 10 data and 15 years of pioneer 11 data , one should be able to test the hypothesis that heat is the origin of the anomaly . in 25 years",
    ", the pioneer rtg heat will have decreased by 18% in an approximately linear manner .",
    "this signal could be seen , as well as any faster fall - off coming from the electrical power decline in the main bus .",
    "this same data set could allow a clear determination of the annual term ( not to mention the diurnal one @xcite ) by taking 50 day or shorter averages of the data over the entire period . assuming , as before , that the term exists , a test could then be done to see if indeed the term is caused by a misalignment of the pioneer orbits on the j2000 ecliptic , or by something else .    finally ,",
