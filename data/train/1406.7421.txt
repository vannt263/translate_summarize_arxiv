    "in classical general relativity , the geometry of the space - time near a charged black hole is described by the reissner - nordstrm solution . in low - energy string theory the solution for the static charged black hole was found by gibbons and maeda @xcite and , independently , three years later , by garfinkle , horowitz and strominger @xcite . in literature",
    "this solution is known as gibbons - maeda - garfinkle - horowitz - strominger ( gmghs ) black hole . in 1993 , using a solution generating technique , horowitz @xcite derived a metric that fulfills einstein - maxwell dilaton field equations .",
    "he showed that this new solution is the static spherically symmetric solution for a charged massless dilaton obtained earlier by gibbons and maeda , respectively garfinkle , horowitz and strominger .",
    "the line element for this metric is : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is related to the electrical charge of the black hole and @xmath2 to its mass .",
    "for @xmath3 this black hole has an event horizon . in the case",
    "@xmath4 the area of the horizon shrinks to zero and the solution describes a naked singularity .",
    "this case is named extremal gmghs black hole .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we derive the geodesics equations . in the third section we analyse the effective potential for time - like geodesics .",
    "the potential depends on several variables : radial coordinate @xmath5 , angular momentum of the particle @xmath6 and two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 related to mass , respectively electrical charge of black hole .",
    "when we mention derivatives , we mean derivatives in respect to @xmath7 , variable proportional to the radial coordinate .",
    "the circular time - like geodesics correspond to extrema of the effective potential , therefore we examine the existence of the zeros of its first derivative .",
    "further we discuss the stability of the circular orbits and determine the radius of the innermost stable orbit and the radius of the shortest circular orbit . in the end , we compare our results with those acquired by other authors for schwarzschild black hole and extremal gmghs black hole , cases obtained for specific values of the parameters involved in this analysis .",
    "the study of time - like geodesics in a schwarzschild space - time was made by chandrasekhar , @xcite .",
    "for an extremal gmghs black hole the innermost stable circular orbit was found by pradhan in @xcite .",
    "a free test particle moves around a black hole along a time - like geodesics .",
    "we can derive the geodesics equations directly , using the hamilton jacobi theory ( see blaga and blaga @xcite ) or writing the euler - lagrange equations ( see fernando @xcite ) .",
    "we will follow the last approach described in detail by chandrasekhar ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the lagrangian for the metric ( [ cblaga - metr ] ) is : @xmath8 where the dot means the differentiation with respect to @xmath9 - an affine parameter along the geodesic .",
    "we will choose this parameter so that @xmath10 on a time - like geodesics , @xmath11 on a null geodesics and @xmath12 on a space - like geodesics .",
    "the coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 are cyclic , therefore the motion admits two integrals .",
    "the first integral of motion is @xmath15 the energy integral .",
    "the constant @xmath16 is the total energy of the particle .",
    "the second integral of motion is @xmath17 the integral of angular momentum .    from the euler - lagrange equation for the coordinate @xmath18",
    "we get @xmath19 = r \\left ( r - \\frac{q^2}{m }   \\right ) \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\dot{\\varphi}^2\\,.\\ ] ] if we consider that @xmath20 when @xmath21 , then from ( [ cblaga - ecteta ] ) it follows that @xmath22 and @xmath23 along the geodesic .",
    "hence the geodesics are planar , like in schwarzschild space - time or in newtonian gravitational field .",
    "if @xmath23 , then the angular momentum integral ( [ cblaga - imc ] ) becomes : @xmath24 where @xmath6 is the angular momentum about an axis normal at the plane in which the motion took place .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation corresponding to @xmath5 coordinate is complicated .",
    "usually it is replaced with the condition of constancy of the lagrangian , in which the integrals of motion are substituted .",
    "after some algebra , we obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26 for time - like geodesics , @xmath27 for null geodesics and @xmath28 for space - like geodesics . for the time - like geodesics , the parameter @xmath9 is the proper time of the particle describing the geodesics . if we compare the relation ( [ cblaga - et ] ) with the energy conservation law from the motion of a particle in the newtonian gravitational field , we notice that the second term from the left - hand side of the relation ( [ cblaga - et ] ) could be interpreted as the effective potential .",
    "we introduce @xmath29 known as effective potential . in literature , sometimes the function ( [ cblaga - veff ] ) is denoted by @xmath30 , because if the energy is positive , the motion is possible only if @xmath31 .",
    "the points @xmath5 for which the total energy equals effective potential are known as radial turning points .",
    "for time - like geodesics @xmath26 . with the notations @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ,",
    "the effective potential ( [ cblaga - veff ] ) becomes @xmath35 the quantity @xmath36 is the specific electrical charge .",
    "we notice that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , in our study , we consider @xmath39 and @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the case @xmath41 corresponds to a schwarzschild black hole and @xmath42 to an extremal gmghs black hole .",
    "outside the event horizon @xmath43 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath44 is not defined in @xmath45 or @xmath46 , it is positive for @xmath47 , negative for @xmath48 .",
    "it tends to @xmath49 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , it is zero at the event horizon and tends to @xmath50 when @xmath51 .    in the figure 1",
    "we have plotted @xmath52 against @xmath32 for different values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the motion is possible only if @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath55 , then from ( [ cblaga - et ] ) it follows that @xmath56 and the test particle might change its direction of motion .",
    "these points are called radial turning points . if @xmath57 and @xmath58 , then the particle describes a circular orbit .",
    "we notice that only for specific values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 the motion is bounded .",
    "if we compare the plots for different values of @xmath54 - parameter related to the electrical charge of the black hole - we notice that if @xmath54 increases , the energy of the particles reaching the event horizon increases ( figure 1d ) .        for circular orbits @xmath59 and @xmath58 .",
    "the new variable @xmath60 is proportional with @xmath5 , therefore the last condition is equivalent with @xmath61 , which follow us to @xmath62 the circular orbits correspond to the roots of the numerator - a third degree polynomial in @xmath60 .",
    "the nature of its roots depends on the sign of the discriminant @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a third degree polynomial in @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath65 , there will be one real root and two conjugate complex roots , if @xmath66 there will be three real roots , at least two of which being equal , while if @xmath67 , there will be three real and unequal roots .    in our analysis @xmath39 and @xmath68 ,",
    "hence the sign of the discriminant is the sign of the function @xmath69 . if @xmath42 then @xmath66 for all @xmath53 . to determine the sign of function @xmath69 we will consider it as a function of variable @xmath53 and parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the function @xmath70 tends to @xmath71 if @xmath72 and @xmath73 if @xmath74 .",
    "the zeros of @xmath69 are the roots of the cubic equation in @xmath53 .",
    "its discriminant is @xmath75 hence the function @xmath69 has a real root , except the cases @xmath41 and @xmath42 . if @xmath41 the roots are @xmath76 - double root and @xmath77 a single root and if @xmath42 then @xmath78 is a triple root .",
    "the real root of the discriminant @xmath79 is @xmath80{8 - 4\\,b}- 18 \\ , \\sqrt [ 3]{2 } \\left ( 2-b \\right ) ^{2/3 } -\\left ( b-6   \\right ) ^{2}}{b-18}}\\ ] ] we have plotted in figure 2 the function @xmath81 .",
    "we notice that @xmath82 decreases from 12 to 2 , when @xmath54 increases from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "we conclude that if @xmath85 then @xmath58 has one real root . if @xmath86 the derivative of the effective potential has two real roots ( one single root and a double root ) and if @xmath87 then @xmath58 has three real roots .    studying the relations between the coefficients and the roots of the third degree polynomial from the numerator of @xmath88",
    ", we noticed that , in our case , the sum and the product of the roots are positive , thus the third order equation has at least one positive root .",
    "it corresponds to a circular orbit inside the event horizon ) in the variable @xmath89 . ] .",
    "the other roots of the numerator correspond to circular orbits outside the event horizon .      for a given @xmath54 ,",
    "if @xmath90 there will be two circular orbits outside the event horizon .",
    "a circular orbit is stable if it locates a minimum of the effective potential and unstable if it locates a maximum of the effective potential curve . from the figure 1",
    ", we have noticed that outside the events horizon , the smaller root of the first derivative of the effective potential is unstable and the greater is the stable one .",
    "the radius of the stable orbit tends to infinity when @xmath53 increases endlessly for all @xmath54 .",
    "the smallest value of the radius of the stable circular geodesics corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "we have plotted it in the figure 3 with solid line .",
    "the radius of the isco decreases from @xmath91 - at @xmath41 schwarzschild black hole - to @xmath92 at @xmath42 extremal gmghs black hole .",
    "we have obtained the same values like other authors who derived the radius of the innermost stable orbit for these two extreme black holes : schwarzschild black hole - chandrasekhar in @xcite and for an extremal gmghs black hole - pradhan in @xcite .",
    "the limit of the radius of the unstable circular orbit when @xmath53 tends to infinity depends on @xmath54 .",
    "this limit corresponds to the circular orbit with the smallest radius , the so called shortest circular orbit ( sco ) .",
    "it is plotted with dashed line in the figure 3 and decreases from @xmath93 to @xmath84 when @xmath54 increases from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "the value of the shortest circular orbit for schwarzschild black hole was obtained by chandrasekhar in @xcite .      in conclusion , for a given @xmath54 , if @xmath94 there are circular time - like geodesics near the given charged spherical symmetric black hole .",
    "the radius of the unstable circular orbit is located between the radius of sco and the radius of isco ( corresponding to the given @xmath54 ) , between the dashed and solid line in figure 3 .",
    "the radius of the stable circular time - like geodesic is @xmath95 .",
    "the radii of the circular geodesics are determined by the value of the angular momentum ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "closer to the black hole is located the unstable circular geodesic and further the stable one .",
