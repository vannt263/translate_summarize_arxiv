    "one of the most fascinating phenomena occurring in disordered systems is anderson localization @xcite .",
    "this dynamics relies on the restoration of interference effects due to coherent scattering , which alters the eigenmodes of the system from extended to localized and traps the electromagnetic radiation into long - living resonant states .",
    "the transition to anderson localization is normally manifested as the breaking of light diffusion , with the emergence of localized states whose properties are described by a characteristic length namely the localization length @xmath0 that measures the spatial degree of localization achieved through anderson modes @xcite .",
    "diffusion and localization can share an intermediate stage known as weak localization , which acts as a precursor for anderson localization to settle in @xcite . in the research panorama initiated by anderson , an open problem is represented by the regime of strong localization of light , where interference effects are expected to be more pronounced @xcite .",
    "in this situation , a full vectorial solution of maxwell s equations @xcite can be applied to rigorously study the problem . among the various open issues , a fundamental question concerns",
    "the role of disorder in sustaining strongly localized states , and how to effectively vary the randomness in order to control localized modes and achieve strong localization effects . this problem is essential not only to capture new insights on the dynamics of localization , but also to identify new avenues for the application of disordered systems to the manipulation of light properties .",
    "+ in this article , we combine random matrix theory ( rmt ) with massively parallel finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) simulations , and study the behavior of light localization versus disorder in 1d , 2d and 3d systems .",
    "more specifically , we begin with one dimensional media and employ rmt @xcite to demonstrate the existence of a unique minimum in @xmath0 , as well as the existence of an optimal degree of disorder for localizing light .",
    "we then considered 2d and 3d geometries , and evaluated through parallel fdtd simulations the behavior of @xmath0 in the spectral region where the highest density of localized states is expected to be observed .",
    "in particular , we considered different realizations of disordered photonic crystals and analyzed the properties of localized states near the band edge of the photonic bandgap , which is expected to support a high density of localized states @xcite .",
    "as in the 1d case , we found that the variation of @xmath0 is characterized by a bell - shaped behavior showing a unique minimum associated to the strongest localization possible .",
    "for average disorder values different from this optimal condition , strong localization of light is completely lost .",
    "this contributes , in part , to explain the elusive character of this phenomenon .",
    "quite remarkably , our analysis reveals that in the condition of maximal localization , electromagnetic modes are constituted by defect states , whose localization length is smaller than one cell of the periodic crystal and has a subwavelength spatial extension , which in both 2d and 3d cases is approximatively @xmath1 smaller than a single internal wavelength in the high index refractive material .",

    "the average disorder range for the observation of strong localization effects is quite narrow : approximatively @xmath116 in 2d and only @xmath128 in three dimensions .",
    "these results contribute , to a certain extent , to also explain the elusive nature of this phenomenon .",
    "+ an interpretation for the qualitatively similar behavior of @xmath0 versus disorder in 1d , 2d and 3d systems can be drawn by generalizing the one dimensional rmt analysis to higher manifolds . in 2d and 3d cases , in fact , we can fold the photons dynamics over the scattering trajectory of light rays . a single ray , in the most common configuration where only two materials are employed ( i.e.",

    "the presence of a higher dimensional manifold allows a richer dynamics of the evolution of light paths if compared to the one dimensional case , which might lead to a different scenario for light localization ( e.g. , mobility edge , marginal localization , coexistence of localized and extended states , ... ) .",
    "however , among all the various paths available , we can intuitively expect that the variation of disorder can lead to the formation of a minimum in @xmath0 when , on average , light rays scatter along trajectories whose disorder is optimal for their one dimensional evolution . regardless of the presence of a higher manifold for the dynamics of light , we can therefore qualitatively expect the appearance of a single minimum , if the average disorder is able to optimally localize the dynamics of light rays .",
    "+ as a final step of our theoretical analysis , we investigated the nature of localized modes in the strongest localization regime .",
    "calculation of the local density of states revealed that in this condition light localization is sustained by defect states originated by a few eigenfrequencies inside the electromagnetic band gap .",
    "this results in a very strong spatial confinement for light , due to the excitation of such disordered - induced impurity modes . from a physical perspective , such a strong confinement can be explained by considering that a defect mode results from the interference of a large number of plane waves that , being localized in the spectral bandgap , can not couple to any extended state of the structure and are forced to interfere at every wavevector @xmath129 .",
    "the ideal case of an infinite sum of plane waves , which coherently interfere at every angle , yields the smallest spot achievable , i.e. , a dirac - delta @xmath36 function .",
    "conversely , the opposite case of an incoherent summation of plane waves originates the well - known rayleigh distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that does not show any hot - spot with subwavelength confinement .",
    "our analysis shows that suitable values the disorder support a coherent combination of plane waves that lives in between these two extrema i.e .",
    ", a full coherent combination and a totally incoherent interference , which results into a subwavelength spatial confinement for light . a proper engineering of disorder can therefore be employed as an avenue for subwavelength light localization , where extremely narrow hot energy spot can be generated to highly enhance absorption and/or emission properties of purely dielectric materials .",
    "this is expected to open new applications in the field of high power lasers , sensing and energy harvesting devices .",
    "for computer time , this research used the resources of the supercomputing laboratory at king abdullah university of science & technology ( kaust ) in thuwal , saudi arabia .",
