    "in the quantum information science , one of the challenges is to understand the exact nature of correlations present in a multiparticle system .",
    "because of its complex nature , we still have little success in this respect @xcite .",
    "correlations , specially quantum correlations , have been very useful for a host of quantum information processing tasks , such as quantum computing @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "the quantum correlations also lie at the heart of quantum mysteries and account for many counter - intuitive features of the quantum world .",
    "therefore , a understanding of the nature of quantum correlations is very important .",
    "the correlations in a system can be of classical and/or quantum nature .",
    "usually , it has been believed that quantum correlations are due to entanglement .",
    "a number of measures for this have also been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , more recently , it has been suggested that the quantum correlations go beyond the simple idea of entanglement @xcite . in particular , it has been argued that quantum discord @xcite quantifies all types of quantum correlations including entanglement .",
    "discord is the difference between total correlations and classical correlations present in a state . in recent years , it has been one of the main topics of research @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that quantum discord also has operational significance @xcite .",
    "a number of different measures of quantum correlations similar to quantum discord have been proposed in the literature . these are quantum deficit @xcite , measurement induced disturbance @xcite , geometric discord @xcite , and many more .",
    "it has recently been argued that the quantum discord , and similar information theoretic measures , actually not only quantifies entanglement , i.e. , nonlocal quantumness but also local quantumness @xcite .",
    "for example , it the presence of local quantumness , which leads to increase in discord by applying certain kinds of local noise @xcite .",
    "it is still to be established that a state with zero entanglement and non - zero discord can act as a resource for a nonlocal task . in this sense ,",
    "the phrase `` quantum correlations beyond entanglement '' may be a misnomer .",
    "however information theoretic measures like discord do seem to characterize quantum properties of a state beyond entanglement , in particular local quantumness .",
    "such measures appear to characterize the quantum properties of a state more completely .",
    "therefore , it will be useful to generalize the measures like quantum discord to multiparticle systems .",
    "there have been several attempts in this direction @xcite .",
    "we will use multivariate mutual information for our generalization .",
    "one important point that we emphasize in this paper is the usefulness of a vector - like quantity to characterize and quantify the quantumness of a state .",
    "the correlations in mixed states of a system , or even pure states of a multiparticle system are multifaceted .",
    "they can not be characterized by just one number .",
    "we first illustrate it by considering two - qubit mixed states .",
    "we introduce a quantumness vector for characterizing these mixed states .",
    "this idea is then extended to multiparticle states .",
    "for generalization of quantum discord to @xmath0-qubit case , we use multivariate mutual information @xcite .",
    "classically this mutual information characterizes genuine multivariate correlations in @xmath0 random variables .",
    "it is based on a venn - diagram type approach .",
    "there exist many expressions for this @xmath0-variable mutual information , all of which are same classically but differ when conditional entropies are generalized to quantum level . for a multiparticle system",
    ", one can make measurement on one - particle , or on more than one - particle to probe the different aspects of the quantum correlations .",
    "this would lead to multiple quantities that can eventually characterize the correlations present in the system .",
    "some such physical quantities , called  quantum dissension \" , were introduced in our previous work @xcite . here",
    "we extend the notion of dissension to two different tracks . in the first track we proceed in the usual way by which quantum discord was defined as difference of classical information from total amount of information present in the system .",
    "then we extend the definition to multiparticle case .",
    "in the second approach we extend the notion of quantum correlation from the perspective of quantifying the maximum amount of correlation induced in the system as a result of measurement .",
    "all possible measurements are included . in each track , to characterize multiparticle correlations we will have @xmath1 quantities based on @xmath2 types of measurements we can have .",
    "for example , in the tripartite case , in each track we shall have two quantities that will characterize the correlations .",
    "interestingly , these values can be negative because a measurement on a subsystem can enhance the correlations in the rest of the system .",
    "this approach emphasizes the fact that a single quantity alone is not sufficient to characterize the quantum properties of a state .",
    "this paves the way of defining quantum correlation as a vector quantity .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss classical mutual information and its extension to quantum regime . in section iii ,",
    "we discuss correlations and quantumness . in section iv ,",
    "we extend the notion of discord along two different tracks and give expressions for dissension vectors for @xmath0-qubit case . in section",
    "v , we analyze these measures with examples for two , three , and four - qubit cases . in sections",
    "vi and vii , we address a few related issues .",
    "finally we conclude in section viii .",
    "let us consider two random variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the common information that they possess is characterized by mutual information @xmath5 where @xmath6 is shannon entropy of @xmath3 and @xmath7 is the joint entropy .",
    "there are many uses of mutual information .",
    "our interest is in its ability to capture correlations between two probability distributions .",
    "using chain rule , one can express mutual information also as , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the conditional entropy .    in quantum regime ,",
    "mutual information is written in terms of von neumann entropy of density matrices .",
    "intuitively this quantity solely should measure the correlations between two subsystems of a bipartite density matrix .",
    "but in reality it does not .",
    "it is sometimes suggested that the mutual information quantifies the total correlations of a bipartite system @xcite .",
    "however , in general what it characterizes about the state is somewhat elusive @xcite .",
    "also the generalization of this quantity to quantum regime leads to many new features and complexities .",
    "one way of generalization is that of replacing the probability distributions with density matrices and another is using relative entropy , i.e. , for a bipartite state @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents von neumann entropy and @xmath13 is relative entropy .      the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ alteri ] ) for the bipartite quantum state @xmath14 are , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the quantum conditional entropy . if we directly extend the classical conditional entropy expression to quantum domain , then @xmath17 , which is negative for pure entangled state .",
    "this negativity of conditional entropy was explained in the references @xcite .",
    "however , there is an alternate view which says that to know a state we have to make a measurement @xcite .",
    "this is then the meaning of  conditional \" .",
    "so , conditional entropy can also be expressed as , @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the identity matrix of order @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , in general , the rank one positive operator valued measure ( povm ) on part @xmath4 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to examine multiparticle systems .",
    "so we need a generalization of the bipartite mutual information to a multiparticle situation .",
    "we will use the usual generalization based on venn diagram approach . in this approach , three variable mutual information for three variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath24",
    "is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is conditional mutual information @xcite .",
    "this can be immediately generalized to @xmath0-variate mutual information .",
    "using chain rules , this generalization will lead to the multivariate mutual information as , @xmath27 in literature , this quantity is also known as the  interaction information . by analogy , one can write the multiparticle mutual information of the state @xmath28 as , @xmath29 where @xmath30 in the sum denotes @xmath31 and @xmath32 varies from @xmath33 to @xmath0 .",
    "this generalization has not been explored much . in this paper",
    ", we will use this generalization and define a vector type correlation measure to characterize and quantify multiparticle correlations .",
    "however , there exist at least two more mutual information like quantities in literature .",
    "first one is known as ` total correlation ' .",
    "the total correlation for three variables is @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "this quantity can be generalized for multi - variables i.e. , @xmath36 this can easily be generalized to quantum regime for the state @xmath37 @xmath38 the second line of the eq.([gi - unu ] ) shows that it is a distance between the state and tensor products of its marginals .",
    "this generalization has been used in literature @xcite to capture total correlations in a multiparticle quantum state .",
    "note that the above generalization is always positive .",
    "another possible quantity is the ` dual total correlation ' , or ` binding information ' or , sometime known as ` secrecy monotone ' @xcite . for three random variables it is expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40",
    ". the above quantity can be generalized for multi - variables i.e. , @xmath41 this quantity can easily be extended to the quantum state , @xmath37 @xmath42 note that the above quantity is also always positive @xcite and for pure states @xmath43 .",
    "this quantity has been used in literature for capturing correlations in a quantum state @xcite and to detect the shared secret correlations between the parties @xcite .",
    "the total correlation , @xmath44 and the binding information , @xmath45 are monotones under locc ( local operation and classical communication ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the eqs.([mui ] , [ gi - unu ] and [ secrecy_mono ] ) reduce to @xmath46 .",
    "the fig.([3mutualv ] ) depicts the relations between the possible generalizations of multivariate mutual information .",
    "these relations may not hold for quantum case . from the diagram ,",
    "it is clear that only @xmath47 characterizes genuine multipartite correlations .",
    "other two generalizations , @xmath48 and @xmath49 also contain bipartite correlations .",
    "we are using generalization of @xmath47 to quantum domain .",
    "@xmath50{3mutual.pdf } \\end{array}\\ ] ]      one feature of the multivariate mutual information , as given by venn diagram approach , is that it can be negative .",
    "sometimes , it is considered a negative aspect of this approach . however , as we will see , the negative value characterizes a very special type of correlations . for this",
    "we consider mutual information @xcite of three variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath24 , as given in eq.([cond - im ] ) . in this definition ,",
    "both @xmath51 and @xmath52 are non - negative , but @xmath53 can be negative , when @xmath54 . this situation will occur when knowing @xmath24 enhances the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . let us take a well known example of ` modulo 2 addition ( @xmath55 ) of two binary random variables ( xor - gate ) ' .",
    "suppose , @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are independent then @xmath57 .",
    "however , once we know the value of @xmath24 , knowing the value of @xmath3 uniquely determines the value of @xmath4 . hence the knowledge of @xmath24 enhances the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath52 is non - zero .",
    "this implies when @xmath53 is negative , it captures certain aspect of the correlations among the variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath24 .    the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ cond - im ] ) in the quantum regime , for the state @xmath58 is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is conditional mutual information .",
    "let us consider the case of a three - qubit ghz state @xmath61 .",
    "if we trace out any one qubit from the state then the reduced density matrix is a mixture of product states , i.e. , @xmath62 . for this state ,",
    "the mutual information is @xmath63 .",
    "next , we have to compute @xmath64 for @xmath65",
    ". its value will depend on the measurement basis .",
    "we know @xmath66 in any measurement basis but other two terms @xmath67 and @xmath68 depend on the measurement basis . if we do measurement in computational basis @xmath69 on qubit @xmath24 , the conditional mutual information @xmath70 because both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are zero .",
    "so the total mutual information is @xmath71 , i.e. , positive .",
    "it is not surprising because the state of remaining two qubits , after measurement on one qubit , does not have enhanced entanglement .",
    "but if we do measurement on one qubit , say @xmath24 , in hadamard basis @xmath72 , the mutual information , @xmath73 , which means , total mutual information is @xmath74 , i.e. , negative .",
    "this is expected , since now the state of two qubits @xmath75 is a bell state ; so measurement on @xmath24 qubit has enhanced the entanglement in @xmath75 subsystem .",
    "the essence of this discussion is that in both classical and quantum regime multivariate mutual information can be negative , characterizing a special type of correlations .",
    "whether a quantum state ( of more than one particle ) has correlations or not , is often far from obvious .",
    "this is because the meaning of the word ` correlation ' , as often used in literature , is quite fluid .",
    "we know the meaning of correlation in classical world but in the case of a quantum state there are classicality and quantumness .",
    "this makes the nature of correlations very complex .",
    "if we take the intuitive meaning of correlations @xcite , then quantum correlations are nonlocal in nature , and can be taken as due to entanglement of the state only .",
    "they exist due to the nonlocal quantumness of a state .",
    "a state can also have classical correlations @xcite and local quantumness @xcite .",
    "when we speak of quantumness of a state , it can be local or nonlocal in character .",
    "information theoretic measures like quantum discord , and its generalization like dissension , characterize and quantify both types of quantumness . next we emphasize the need of a vector measure to characterize the quantumness of a state .",
    "we then expand on local and nonlocal quantumness .      in the reference @xcite",
    ", authors have given a way of quantifying quantum correlations present in bipartite two - qubit states through quantum discord .",
    "to do so they used different generalizations of the mutual information to quantum regime . let us consider the bipartite state @xmath10 .",
    "then using eqs .",
    "( [ qi-2 ] and [ alterqi ] ) , the discord is defined in the following way , @xmath76 where @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "obviously the above definition is not symmetric in the parties . when @xmath79 , it is usual discord and for @xmath80 it is @xmath81 .",
    "sometimes one of the discords is zero even when other is nonzero .",
    "if we take that the quantum discord captures ` quantumness ' present in a state , it is quite clear that we need both the discords to know the exact quantumness of the state .",
    "one can define ` another discord ' as , @xmath82 this definition is symmetric in the parties .",
    "this quantity is nothing but the sum of the two discords @xmath81 and @xmath83 .",
    "let us compute the above quantities in the following examples . for this purpose",

    "one might say that a mixture of non - orthogonal separable states has local quantumness , i.e. , local superposition , which can not be hidden by writing down another decomposition of the density matrix . to illustrate the various feature of a state ,",
