    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are powerful flashes of high  energy photons occurring at an average rate of a few per day throughout the universe .",
    "their luminosity is such that they can be detected up to very high redshift ( the current record is grb  080913 at @xmath7 ; greiner et al .",
    "the energy source of a grb is believed to be associated to the collapse of the core of a massive star in the case of long  duration grbs , and due to merger or accretion  induced collapse for the short  hard class of grbs ( see mszros 2006 for a recent review ) . in this paper",
    ", we limit our analysis to the class of long  duration grbs .",
    "the knowledge of grbs has enormously benefited from the observations of the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "although the current sample of grbs with known redshift is still too poor to allow a direct measure of the grb luminosity function ( lf ) , important constraints on the cosmic evolution of these sources can be set on the basis of recent _ swift _ results .",
    "in particular , salvaterra & chincarini ( 2007 , herethereafter sc07 ) showed that models in which grbs are unbiased tracer of cosmic star formation and are characterised by a constant lf are robustly ruled out by the number of grb detections at @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "similar conclusions were reached recently by other studies ( e.g. guetta , piran & waxman 2005 ; daigne et al .",
    "2006 ; cen & fang 2007 ; kistler et al .",
    "moreover , they have shown that _",
    "swift _ data can be reproduced assuming luminosity evolution of the grb lf ( see also lloyd - ronning , fryer & ramires - ruiz 2002 ; wei & gao 2003 ; daigne et al .",
    "2006 ) and/or that grbs form preferentially in low metallicity environments ( see also natarajan et al .",

    "2008 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we derive the formation efficiency and the free parameters describing the grb lf by fitting the differential peak flux distribution of batse grbs in these two scenarios .",
    "we then obtain new and tighter constraints on the cosmic evolution of long grbs by comparing different models against the number of luminous ( i.e. with isotropic peak luminosities @xmath10 erg s@xmath3 ) grbs detected by _",
    "swift_. we also consider models with joint luminosity and density evolution providing a robust upper limit on the steepness of the bright  end of the grb lf .",
    "this letter is organised as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the different models and the main equations used in the calculation of the lf , and in section  3 , we compare model results against _ swift _ data .",
    "finally , we summarise our findings in section  4 .",
    "the observed photon flux , @xmath11 , in the energy band @xmath12 , emitted by an isotropically radiating source at redshift @xmath13 is    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the differential rest ",
    "frame photon luminosity of the source , and @xmath16 is the luminosity distance . to describe the typical burst spectrum we adopt the functional form proposed by band et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , i.e. a smoothly broken power ",
    "law with a low  energy spectral index @xmath17 , a high  energy spectral index @xmath18 , and a break energy @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( preece et al .",
    "2000 , kaneko et al .",
    "the spectrum normalisation is obtained by imposing that the isotropic ",
    "equivalent peak luminosity is @xmath22 . in order to broadly estimate the peak energy of the spectrum ,",
    "@xmath23 , for a given @xmath24 , we assumed the validity of the correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 , ghirlanda et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is basically a diffenent expression of the @xmath25 relation ( amati et al .",
    "2002 , amati 2006 ) .",
    "@xmath26    although the above correlation has an appreciable scatter , we will show that this does not affect our results .",
    "given a normalised grb lf , @xmath27 , the observed rate of bursts with peak flux between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is    @xmath30    where @xmath31 $ ] is the comoving volume element , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . ] , and @xmath34^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "@xmath35 is the solid angle covered on the sky by the survey , and the factor @xmath36 accounts for cosmological time dilation .",
    "finally , @xmath37 is the comoving burst formation rate . in this work , we model the grb lf with a power law with an exponential cut  off at low luminosities :    @xmath38    sc07",
    "have shown that models in which grb form proportionately to the star formation rate ( sfr ) and are described by a lf constant in redshift are robustly ruled out by the number of grb with sure detection at @xmath0 and @xmath1 during the first two years of _ swift _ mission .",
    "thus , grbs should have experienced some kind of evolution , being more luminous or more common in the past .",
    "therefore we consider here two families of models : ( i ) luminosity evolution models , where the cut  off luminosity in the grb lf varies as @xmath39 and ( ii ) density evolution models , where grbs form preferentially in galaxies with metallicity below a given threshold @xmath5 . in the first case ,",
    "the grb formation rate is simply proportional to the global sfr , i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "we use here the recent determination of the sfr obtained by hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) , slightly modified to match the observed decline of the sfr with @xmath41 at @xmath42 suggested by recent deep  field data ( stark et al .",
    "for the density evolution models , the grb formation rate is obtained by convolving the observed sfr with the fraction of galaxies at redshift @xmath13 with metallicity below @xmath5 using the expression computed by langer & norman ( 2006 ) . in this scenario , the cut  off luminosity is assumed to be constant in redshift , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , we consider a third family of models in which both effects are presented : grbs form preferentially in environments with @xmath44 and are characterised by an evolving lf .",

    "however , since we are dealing with strong lower limit on the real number of bright burst detections , we have also to consider the case in which some luminous bursts are hidden among the grbs missing redshift and/or @xmath23 measurement .",
    "we find that the null hypothesis probability decreases rapidly with the number of bright burst detections and already for 10 bright bursts it drops down to the percent level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : prob ] ) .",
    "so , although the @xmath70 scenario can not formally be discarded by available data , some degree of luminosity evolution in the grb lf is suggested if just a few more bright bursts had to be added to our measured sample . for @xmath73 ( 0.2 )",
    "@xmath74 , the models can account up to 16 ( 12 ) bright bursts in the whole _ swift _ data sample , i.e. just 7 ( 3 ) hidden bright bursts ( fig .  [",

    "the error bars correspond to a null hypothesis probability of 1% that the model reproduces the differential peak flux distribution of batse grbs .",
    "we find that for @xmath4 , the available constraints require luminosity evolution in the grb lf .",
    "below this threshold , models charaterised by a constant lf can account for the number of known luminous bursts considering the error bars . as already pointed out , the existence of a few bright bursts hidden among gbrs without a sure redshift and/or @xmath23 measure ( more than 2/3 of the whole _ swift _ catalogue ) ,",
    "would imply the need of luminosity evolution even for lower value of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , note here that the existence of a distinct population of long low - luminosity grbs at low - z ( see e.g. guetta & della valle 2007 ) strengthens our conclusions . in the form of the adopted lf ( see eq .  (",
    "[ eq : lf ] ) ) , we do not include this population in our calculations .",
    "should this population be statistically significant and present at all redshifts , the faint end of the lf would be more populated and all model predictions would be shifted towards lower values , increasing the discrepancy between model results and data . since for pure density evolution models the lf cut - off luminosity is considerably larger than for pure luminosity evolution models , the former models would be more severely affected by the existence of a large population of underluminous bursts at any redshift . in conclusion , although we can not rule out at a high confidence level pure density evolution models with @xmath75 , available data suggest some luminosity evolution in the grb lf with redshift .    finally , we constrain the steepness of the bright  end of the grb lf ( bottom panel of fig .
