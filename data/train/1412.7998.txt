    "the idea of dependence logic , introduced in @xcite on the basis of hodges @xcite , is the following : if truth in the traditional sense , i.e. as tarski defined it , is defined with respect to a _ set _ of assignments , rather than just _ one _ assignment , it becomes possible to talk meaningfully about variables being _ dependent _ or _ independent _ from each other .",
    "the set of assignments can be thought of as a _ data set _ , giving evidence  much as in statistics  about mutual dependencies between the variables . if the set of assignments  the data  is thought of as a _ database _ we arrive at the concept of _ functional dependency _ , an important concept in database theory since codd s pioneering paper @xcite .",
    "we can also consider the set of assignments as expressing _ uncertainty _",
    "about one  true \" assignment , as in _ inquisitive logic _ ( @xcite ) , or as indicating _ belief _ about an unknown assignment , as in _",
    "doxastic logic _",
    "( @xcite ) . finally , considering truth as given by sets of assignments leads naturally to the concept of the _ probability _ that a randomly chosen assignment ( from the given set ) satisfies a given propositional formula .",
    "this idea is developed in @xcite to analyse so - called bell s inequalities of quantum physics .",
    "following @xcite , we call sets of assignments _",
    "teams_. teams have been previously used to study dependence concepts in predicate logic @xcite and modal logic @xcite .",

    "the fundamental concept of dependence logic is the concept @xmath0 of a variable @xmath1 depending on a sequence @xmath2 of other variables , which is taken as a new atomic formula .",
    "the meaning of such atomic dependence formulas is given via _",
    "teams_.    studying the logics of dependence concepts in propositional logic resembles the case of predicate logic in that we use the method of teams .",
    "a _ team _ in this case is defined to be _ a set of valuations _ of propositional variables .",
    "there are , however , also significant differences between the predicate logic and the propositional cases .",
    "notably , propositional logics of dependence are _",
    "decidable_. this is because for any given formula of the logics with @xmath3 propositional variables , there are in total @xmath4 valuations and @xmath5 teams .",
    "the method of truth tables has its analogue in these logics , but the size of such tables grows exponentially faster than in the case of classical propositional logic , rendering it virtually inapplicable .",
    "this emphasizes the role of the axioms and the completeness theorem in providing a manageable alternative for establishing logical consequence .",
    "classical propositional logic is based on propositions of the form    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     if the @xmath6th symbol of a formula @xmath7 starts a string @xmath8 which is a subformula of @xmath7 , we denote the subformula by @xmath9_\\phi$ ] , or simply @xmath9 $ ]",

    "one area is the study of the computational complexity of propositional logics of dependence . a downward closed formula @xmath7 being satisfiable by some team is equivalent to @xmath7 being satisfiable by some singleton team .",
