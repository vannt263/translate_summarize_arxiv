    "in this paper , we undertake a study of the modular representation theory of the cherednik algebras associated to the complex reflection groups @xmath3 , which are generalizations of groups of permutation matrices .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an introduction to these algebras over @xmath4",
    ".    lowest - weight representations of cherednik algebras have been studied in both characteristic @xmath5 and positive characteristic . in characteristic @xmath5 ,",
    "deep tools have been developed and connections between other aspects of representation theory and algebraic geometry have been found .",
    "however , the case of positive characteristic has been studied less , because of a lack of general tools .",
    "the representation theory of complex reflection groups becomes more complicated in positive characteristic , which makes the representation theory of the associated cherednik algebras more interesting .    via a verma - like construction",
    ", the lowest - weight representations can be expressed as quotients of a free module over a polynomial ring .",
    "more precisely , one starts with an irreducible representation @xmath6 of the reflection group @xmath7 and the rank of the free module is @xmath8 .",
    "our approach to the study of these representations is mostly from the perspective of commutative algebra . in the case of @xmath9 ,",
    "then the representation has a ring structure .",
    "the lowest - weight representations are always finite - dimensional in positive characteristic , so is always supported at the origin and there is no obvious geometry at one s disposal .",
    "we prove in some cases , and conjecture in other cases , that this ring can always be presented as a complete intersection inside of the coordinate ring of a subspace arrangement ( which will be a union of flats for the corresponding reflection group ) .",
    "there are natural surjections @xmath10 so any representation @xmath6 of @xmath11 can be considered as a representation of @xmath3 .",
    "we show in  [ sec : degeneration ] that the calculation of the lowest - weight module for the cherednik algebra of @xmath3 reduces to the case of @xmath12 .",
    "this includes the case when @xmath6 is trivial , which was discussed above .",
    "for the most part , our study is focused on this case .",
    "so the calculation of the lowest - weight representation amounts to finding the generators of a certain ideal @xmath13 . by",
    "what we have just said , it suffices to understand the case @xmath14 .",
    "the behavior of the cases @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the symmetric group ) and @xmath17 are different . in some sense , the case @xmath17 is more combinatorial and easier to study . in these cases , we produce an ideal contained in the desired ideal @xmath13 , and we conjecture that it is the full ideal .",
    "we can prove that this is correct in certain situations .",
    "we mention some previous related work on cherednik algebras . in the rank @xmath18 case ,",
    "i.e. , for the cyclic groups @xmath19 , the representation theory was studied by latour @xcite .",
    "balagovi and chen studied the cherednik algebras for @xmath20 and @xmath21 in @xcite .",
    "the non - modular case for the symmetric group @xmath22 ( where the characteristic does not divide the order of the group ) was studied by bezrukavnikov , finkelberg , and ginzburg in the context of algebraic geometry in @xcite .",
    "this case was also studied by gordon @xcite .",
    "lian @xcite studied some of the same groups in our paper , but for different parameters than the ones that we use for the cherednik algebra .",
    "now we summarize the contents of the paper . ",

[ sec : subspace ] contains some information on subspace arrangements which are relevant to our work , as discussed above . in  [ sec : gm1n ] , we extend gordon s work @xcite to the wreath products @xmath23 .",
    "this is straightforward , but we restate the relevant proofs for completeness . in ",
    "[ sec : degeneration ] we relate representations of @xmath3 and @xmath11 as discussed above . for the case @xmath6",
    "trivial , this reduces our study to @xmath14 , and this is discussed in  [ sec : tau - triv ] . in ",
    "[ sec : dihedral ] we give a complete analysis of the groups @xmath24 , which are the dihedral groups . in the last section ",
    "[ sec : rank3 ] , we study the groups @xmath25 and give some partial results .",

    "we say that a matrix @xmath26 is a * reflection * if @xmath26 has finite order , i.e. , @xmath27 for some @xmath28 , and if @xmath29 . over a field of characteristic 0",
    ", this implies that @xmath26 is diagonalizable , and @xmath26 is what is classically known as a complex reflection , or pseudo - reflection .",

    "we point out that this is not a property of an abstract finite group , but really a property of a group together with a faithful representation by matrices . over the complex numbers ,",
    "all finite reflection groups have been classified by shephard and todd @xcite .",
    "we follow their notation for the groups , which we now review for the groups of interest in this paper .    the class of reflection groups that we study in this paper are denoted @xmath3 where @xmath32 are positive integers and @xmath33 divides @xmath34 .",
    "the group @xmath35 consists of @xmath36 matrices such that every row and column contains at most 1 nonzero entry , and such that every nonzero entry is an @xmath34th root of unity ( we implicitly assume that @xmath37 contains primitive @xmath34th roots of unity , i.e. , the equation @xmath38 has @xmath34 distinct solutions in @xmath37 ; note that this implies that the characteristic of @xmath37 does not divide @xmath34 ) .",

    "representations of @xmath3 are constructed from the representations of the symmetric groups of smaller size known as specht modules .",
    "this construction is described in @xcite . when the characteristic of @xmath37 is @xmath5 , specht modules give all irreducible representations , but in positive characteristic specht modules are generally reducible .",

    "is a filling of the partition with the numbers from @xmath18 through @xmath2 .",
