    "in recent years , the effect of a longitudinal field in the ising antiferromagnet on an anisotropic simple cubic ( sc ) lattice has been discussed .",
    "the experimental example is compound @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the differential magnetic susceptibility @xmath11 of this compound was analysed as a function of an extra external field ( @xmath12 koe ) and of temperature ( @xmath13 k ; @xmath14 k ) .",
    "the compound is a typical layer - type ferromagnet , with a very weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the @xmath15 layers , where has been established the magnetic phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic structure .",
    "one of the attractive points of investigating the properties of @xmath10 is that as a consequence of the antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling we may obtain quantitative information about the anisotropy and @xmath16 ( exchange coupling ) by investigating the field dependence of the susceptibility at @xmath17 . in previous papers @xcite",
    "it has been reported that the @xmath18 compounds of general formula @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 or @xmath28 , may be considered as consisting of nearly isolated magnetic layers .",

    "the theoretical calculations show disagreement between differente methods .",
    "the results obtained by the mfa and eft methods show a reentrant behavior in the phase diagram in low - temperature , i.e. , if @xmath0 is just above @xmath34 , then these are two phase transitions as the temperature is increased .    in recent years",

    "we define the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the ordered state for low temperatures and fields is the superantiferromagnetic order ( saf ) , which is characterrized by a parallel spin orientation in horizontal direction and an antiparallel spin orientation of a parallel spin orientation of nearest - neighbors in vertical direction and therefore exhibit nel order within the initial sublattice @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see figure ( [ cubo2 ] ) ) .    if @xmath8 ( @xmath47 ) , the lattice is now composed of independent planes , so the model is exactly solved for @xmath48 , and the critical temperature is obtained by the following relation @xcite    @xmath49    where for the particular isotropic case @xmath50 ( @xmath51 )",
    "we have @xmath52 . for @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , @xmath51 we have an ising model with an external magnetic field on an anisotropic square lattic ( [ 1 ] ) , which was already studied by mc @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we improve the understanding of this model by studying it by means of the effective - field theory and monte carlo simulations for the case @xmath55 and @xmath53 .      in order to implement the present model to perform mc by the metropolis algorithm ,",
    "the simple cubic lattice of size @xmath56 having @xmath57 sites is decomposed into two sublattices ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) with opposite spins , corresponding to the saf ground state .",
    "to meassure the saf order , the appropriate order parameter is defined by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the magnetization of the sublattice @xmath60 , @xmath37 and @xmath61 number of spins . the susceptibility related to this order parameter",
    "is defined as follows :",
    "@xmath62    where @xmath63 is the dimension of the lattice .    in our simulations",
    "we have considered lattices with periodic boundary conditions . in order to determine the system s behavior in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath64 ) , which is imposible to implement on account of computational limitation",
    ", we have to use a finite - size scaling theory @xcite . accordingly , to locate the critical temperature for second - order phase transitions , we approximately locate the crossing point of curves for different sizes of the fourth - order cumulant @xmath65 ( binder cumulant ) defined as @xcite    @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the canonical averages of the second and fourth moments of magnetization , respectively . on the other hand ,",

    ", we obtain @xmath147 , while the first - order transition we have @xmath148 , where this value corresponds to the discontinuity of the staggered magnetization at @xmath149 .",
    "we obtained the phase diagrams in the @xmath5 plane for @xmath9 of the model [ 1 ] by using eft-4 and mc simulatons .",
    "both methods confirmed the existence of a tricritical point in a critical frontier separating the saf order with the paramagnetic disorder as shown in figure 2 . for completeness ,",
    "figure 2 also includes the critical frontier obtained by mc simulatons for the particular case @xmath51 , @xmath8 ( square lattice ) , which lacks of first - order criticality @xcite . in what effective - field calculations concerns ,",
    "we obtain the critical frontier , which consists of the transition temperature as a function of the external magnetic field , separating the saf and p phases , by simultaneously solving the three transcendental equations eqs .",

    "the range of ratio @xmath6 determines the limits of second - order @xmath150 and first - order @xmath151 phase - transition frontiers , where @xmath152 is the tricritical point ( tcp ) . from landau theory ,",
    "the tcp is calculated by the condition given by @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 , obtaining in eft-4 the following values : @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the temperature variation of @xmath158 for fixed reduced field @xmath159 present two type of behavior .",
    "the first for low - field the order parameter decrease to zero continuously as the reduced temperature approaches to the critical point , the temperature ( @xmath0 fixed ) where @xmath147 is the second - order phase transition temperatute , @xmath160 . on the other hand ,",
    "when we are at high - fied the temperature at which the order parameter make a jump discontinuity is the first - order phase transitions going to zero discontinuously at the point @xmath161 . for h value greater than the upper limit of these field ( i. e. , @xmath162 ) , the system exhibits no phase transition ( the order parameter is null for all finite temperature , @xmath163 ) +   + in order to obtain relevant critical points to get the critical frontier in mc simulations , we estimate the critical temperature for a given value of field by a finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "for instance , for @xmath164 , figure 3 shows how the critical temperature was located around the crossing point of @xmath165 curves for sizes @xmath166 , resulting in @xmath167 .",
    "note that critical temperatures for lower fields are superestimated by the eft-4 technique ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the limit of the second - order frontier was found by obtaining several @xmath165 curves for different field values for a given lattice size .",
    "consequently , we found the beginning of the first - order criticality after detecting a change in the behavior of the binder cumulant curve above a certain value of field .",
    "this is well exemplified in figure 4 , for two different field values @xmath168 , @xmath169 , for @xmath170 .",
    "figure 4a shows that the binder cumulant curve already presents a clear first - order transition for @xmath171 , because of the sharply negative fluctuated peaks around the pseudocritical temperature .",
    "moreover , figure 4b also suggests this first - order criticality by the aparent delta - dirac form of the susceptivility , for @xmath171 . in order to confirm what is suggested in short lattice sizes ,",
    "we draw upon the fact that around the critical temperature of a phase transition the susceptibility peaks behave as @xmath172 , where @xmath173 ( @xmath63 is the lattice dimension ) , for a first - order criticality , whereas @xmath174 for a second - order one .",
    "consequently , figure 5 shows a finite - size scaling of the susceptibility peak versus @xmath56 , for sizes @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 . for @xmath168",
    ", we estimated @xmath179 , which is ( within the error bar ) an universal value @xcite for the second - order criticality of the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "for @xmath171 , @xmath180 , which is close to @xmath181 , which suggests a first - order transition .",
    "therefore , the tricritical point must be in the interval @xmath182 .",
    "on the other hand , the first - order curve must end at @xmath183 .",
    "+   + we could estimate some points of the first - order frontier by a finite - size scaling method , however , in order to avoid finite - size problems to obtain well behavied curves for the specific heat or the susceptibility around critical points belonging to the first - order frontier , we decided to estimate the corresponding critical temperatures for given fields by computing the free energy versus @xmath184 , from monte carlo data of energy versus @xmath185 , for a given size .",
    "for instance , in figure 6a it is shown the hysteresis effect from energy data around the critical temperature obtained when cooling or heating the system too fast .",
    "this is because of huge intrinsic autocorrelation times in finite - size systems .",
    "we can improve the location of the critical temperature by obtaining the associated free energies of the low- and high - temperature branches@xcite .",
    "consequently , the crossing point of the free energy branches gives a good estimation of the critical temperature , inasmuch the stable phase has the lower free energy , as shown in figure 4b .",
    "+   + the first - order frontier in mc simulations does not present a reentrant behavior as eft-4 frontier does .",
    "so , this reentrance seems to be an artifact of the effective - field approach .",
    "in summary , we investigated the anisotropic three - dimensional nearest - neighbor ising model with competitive interations in an uniform longitudinal field .",
    "we obtained the phase diagram in the plane @xmath5 , where the critical frontier separates the saf order with the paramagnetic disorder . for lower fields ,",
    "the eft-4 approach superestimates the critical temperatures obtained by mc simulations .",
    "a tricritical point was found for @xmath182 , by a finite - size analysis . at low temperatures",
    "eft-4 calculations show a reentrant first - order frontier , which does not appear by mc simulations .",
    "it suggests that improvements in treating correlations , or by increasing the cluster size in the effective - field approach , could correct this reentrant curve . at zero temperature , the critical field",
    "is exactly obtained , so @xmath186 .",
    "our quantitative estimation for the tricritical point could be bettered by using larger lattice sizes with better metropolis monte carlo techniques like parallel tempering .",
