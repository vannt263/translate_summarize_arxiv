    "carbon - based structures are of a great current interest @xcite .",
    "the challenge of these systems from the fundamental point of view is related to the interplay between different types of atom bonding , leading to a uniquely large variety of structural phases formed by a single element , such as diamond and graphite , single- and multi - shell fullerenes and nanotubes @xcite and other structures @xcite with many peculiar properties . to study the elastic properties and fracture of these structures and their mixtures , the transformation paths between them @xcite , etc .",
    "it is important to develop predictive schemes based on simplified empirical potentials , which allow large - scale simulations of complex structures with mixed atomic bonding , which are often beyond the possibilities of _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "effective many - body empirical potentials have proven to be useful and predictive for a number of materials @xcite .",
    "the potentials developed by tersoff @xcite for group iv elements are very accurate for si and ge , also as far as interface properties are concerned , but less reliable for c.    carbon is particularly difficult for an empirical scheme due to the large variety of different types of c  c bonding with very different energetics and bond lengths @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for a single c",
    " c bond in diamond @xmath1  , for a conjugated bond in graphite @xmath2    and for a double bond in h@xmath3c@xmath4ch@xmath3 @xmath5  .",
    "the tersoff potential , which has been fit to the bulk properties of both diamond and graphite , does not , however , distinguish the chemical character of the bond . at diamond surfaces , different types of bonding",
    "are present at the same time , leading to poor results of the tersoff potential for the surface reconstructions as we show in detail in this work .",
    "brenner @xcite has re - parametrised the tersoff potential and added nonlocal terms to properly account for the bond modifications induced by a change of bonding of neighbouring atoms .",
    "as in the tersoff scheme , the potential energy of the system is written as a sum of effective pair terms for each bond , the energetics of which depends on the local environment ( bond order of tersoff ) and , in addition , on the chemical character of the bond ( single , double , triple or conjugated ) derived by evaluating the number of neighbours for the atoms forming the bond and all their nearest neighbours .",
    "diamond surfaces are an example of a rather simple system , where the interplay between different types of carbon bonding becomes important .",
    "numerous calculations exploiting various _ ab - initio _ approaches and extensive experimental data are available , making the diamond surfaces an important check point to verify the accuracy and predictive power of empirical schemes . the tersoff potential for c yields the unreconstructed ( 111 ) @xmath6 surface as the most stable against the experimental evidence of the @xmath7 pandey chain reconstruction @xcite analogous to that of si(111 ) .",
    "for the ( 001 ) face it strongly favours an asymmetric re - arrangement of carbon atoms beneath the raw of unbuckled dimers @xcite . in the present work we compare in detail the predictions of the brenner and tersoff potentials with results of _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations for known reconstructions of the diamond(100 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "our results reveal high quantitative accuracy of the brenner potential .",
    "since the parameters are fit to the _ bulk _ properties of diamond and graphite and to properties of various hydrocarbon molecules , the high accuracy at the _ surface _ suggests a high predictive power of the potential at short distances . with further modifications to include also long - range interactions ( beyond 2  , the cut - off of the potential ) @xcite , which are now under development @xcite , the brenner potential promises to become a powerful tool to investigate carbon - based structures on a large scale",
    "1 ) and ( right ) the asymmetric ( 2@xmath81)a reconstructions of diamond(100 ) after mc energy minimisation with the brenner potential .",
    "the top and bottom panels show the top ( 100 ) and the side ( 011 ) views .",
    "the numbers on the atoms denote the atomic layer they belong to .",
    "inequivalent bonds between two atomic layers are labelled with letters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ]",
    "our previous study @xcite of the diamond(100 ) surface with the tersoff potential has suggested a new reconstruction with a strongly asymmetric rearrangement of atoms in deeper layers .",
    "these predictions have now been verified using the off - lattice monte carlo ( mc ) technique with the brenner potential . we have confirmed that both the symmetric @xmath7 and asymmetric @xmath7a ( where ` a ' stands for ` asymmetric ' ) structures shown in fig .  [ 100 ] correspond to local energy minima .",
    "however , the energies for the two reconstructions given by the brenner potential are found in a reversed order compared to the prediction of the tersoff potential .",
    "relative to the energy of the relaxed @xmath6 ideal diamond ( 100 ) surface , the energy gain is found with the brenner potential to be @xmath12 and @xmath13 ev per surface dimer for the @xmath7 and @xmath7a structures , respectively . for comparison , the tersoff predictions were @xmath14 and @xmath15 ev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the length of the bonds between atoms in the top four layers are given for the two structures in table  [ table100 ] .",
    "for comparison , we also give the results obtained with the tersoff potential @xcite and those found in _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations @xcite .",
    "note that , from the chemical point of view , each surface atom at the bulk - terminated surface has two un - paired electrons ( two dangling bonds ) .",
    "therefore , the dimer bond ( bond 11 in table  [ table100 ] ) in the symmetric @xmath7 surface structure has the character of a double - bond .",
    "the brenner potential correctly reproduces the length of the bond 11 , which is much shorter than both the single c ",
    "c bond in diamond and the conjugated bond in graphite , but rather close to the length of a double bond .",
    "it quantitatively agrees with the dimer bond length of 1.37    for the @xmath7 diamond(100 ) surface found in _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations @xcite .",
    "conversely , the tersoff potential , which does not include the nonlocal terms , predicts very different length of the dimer bond ; it also gives much smaller reconstruction energy for both structures since the chemical character of stronger double and conjugated bonds is not accounted for . with the brenner potential , in the asymmetric @xmath7a structure , the bond 11 is elongated up to 1.437   ( close to the graphite value ) since it becomes a member of a conjugated ( @xmath16-bonded ) system .",
    "note that the bond 12@xmath10 , which also connects three - fold coordinated atoms , has a very similar length .",
    ".bond lengths for the dimerised symmetric @xmath7 and asymmetric @xmath7a reconstructions ( given in  ) .",
    "the bond between an atom in the @xmath17th layer and one in the @xmath18th layer is labelled by @xmath19 .",
    "whenever more than one nonequivalent bond is present , they are labelled by @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in fig .  [ 100 ] and are displayed in the table in this order . for completeness , we show the bond length as given by _",

    "the value of @xmath12 ev / dimer as given by the brenner potential is found between the _ ab - initio _ values ( 3.02 @xcite , 3.36 @xcite and 3.52 @xcite ev / dimer ) and the reconstruction energy given by the semi - empirical slab - mindo scheme ( 7.86 ev / dimer @xcite ) .",

    "[ 111 ] shows the relaxed @xmath6 and the @xmath7 pandey chain reconstructions of the diamond(111 ) surface as given by the brenner potential . in brief ,",
    "the most important changes of the bond lengths as compared to the bulk value are as follows . for the relaxed @xmath6 structure : ( i )",
    "the contraction of the bond within the first bilayer by @xmath20%   agrees with _ ab - initio _ values of @xmath21%  @xcite , @xmath22%  @xcite and @xmath23%  @xcite ; ( ii ) the elongation of the bond between the first and second bilayer by @xmath24%  agrees with @xmath25%  of ref .",
    "@xcite but seems underestimated compared to @xmath26%  and @xmath27%   of refs .  @xcite . in the @xmath7 pandey reconstruction : ( iii ) the @xmath16-bonded upper chain bond length of 1.437   ( @xmath28% ) well compares to _ ab - initio _ values of 1.47   ( @xmath29% ) @xcite , 1.44    @xcite and 1.43   ( @xmath30% ) @xcite ; ( iv ) the lower chain elongation by @xmath31%  is close to @xmath32%  @xcite and @xmath33%  @xcite ; ( v ) the stretch of the bonds between the first and second bilayers by @xmath34 and @xmath35%  seems to be underestimated with respect to the _ ab - initio _ values of @xmath36% @xcite , @xmath37%  @xcite , @xmath38 and @xmath39% @xcite . further comparison with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite shows that all other bond shifts agree with the _ ab - initio _ calculations within @xmath401% .",
    "therefore , except a tendency to underestimate the elongation of the bonds between the top and second bilayer , our structural results for diamond(111 ) agree remarkably well with _",
    "ab - initio _",
    "predictions @xcite .",
    "relative to the energy of the bulk - terminated diamond(111 ) , we find energy gains per @xmath41 unit cell of 0.244 ev for the @xmath6 structure ( cf 0.37 ev @xcite and 0.57 ev @xcite ) and 1.102 ev for the pandey reconstruction ( cf 0.47 ev @xcite and 1.40 ev @xcite ) .",
    "we note that there is a long - standing debate on the structural and electronic properties of the diamond(111 ) surface .",
    "an important issue is whether this surface is metallic or semiconducting . in most calculations",
    "@xcite the band of surface states is metallic whereas experimentally the highest occupied state is at least 0.5 ev below the fermi level @xcite .",
    "dimerisation along the @xmath16-bonded chain could open the surface gap but only one total - energy calculation obtains slightly dimerised chains yielding a 0.3 ev gap @xcite in the surface band .",
    "experimentally , recent x - ray data @xcite does not show any dimerisation but favour the @xmath7 reconstruction accompanied by a strong tilt of the @xmath16-bonded chains , similar to the @xmath7 reconstruction of si(111 ) and ge(111 ) .",
    "the tilt is however not confirmed by theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "neither dimerisation nor buckling of the @xmath16 chain is found in our results for the pandey reconstruction in agreement to most _ ab - initio _ results",
    ". however , our recent mc study @xcite of the structure of diamond(111 ) based on the brenner potential has shown that , in addition to the stable @xmath7 pandey chain reconstruction , there exist additional meta - stable states , specific for carbon , with all surface atoms in three - fold graphite - like bonding . since the energy of these metastable states is very close to the one of the pandey @xmath7 , these structures can coexist with the pandey structure at a real surface .",
    "moreover , due to symmetry breaking induced by a strong dimerisation of the lower ( 4-fold coordinated ) atomic chain in the first bilayer , the meta - stable reconstructions is likely to exhibit semiconducting behaviour .",
    "although the new structures and their surface electronic properties ought to be checked in _ ab - initio _ studies , the high accuracy of the brenner potential demonstrated in this work strongly supports this prediction .",
    "we have performed off - lattice monte carlo study of the ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) diamond surfaces with the empirical many - body brenner potential @xcite and compared the results in detail with those obtained with the tersoff potential @xcite and with _ ab - initio _ approaches @xcite .",
    "we find that the brenner potential is extremely accurate in describing the structural properties at surfaces , supporting the recent predictions @xcite of new meta - stable reconstructions of diamond(111 ) . on the other hand , the tersoff potential @xcite , which does not distinguish the chemical character of the bond , turns out to give a poor description of surface properties .",
    "the brenner potential , however , can not describe weaker long - range interactions , such as the interplanar interactions in graphite due to the cut - off at 2  . this is the most serious limitation to be overcome . recently",
    ", further modifications of the brenner potential to include also long - range interactions beyond 2   are being proposed @xcite .",
    "given the high accuracy of the short - range part , the modified brenner potential @xcite promises to become a powerful tool to investigate carbon - based structures on a large scale .",
