    "more than ten years ago , in a model generalizing random matrix theory , m. a. stephanov  @xcite has built in the feature that in @xmath1 gluodynamics above @xmath2 the different polyakov loop sectors should behave differently . in the sectors with complex - valued average polyakov loop",
    "the chiral condensate was expected to turn to zero at a temperature @xmath3 substantially higher than @xmath2 , the deconfinement temperature . prior to this paper ,",
    "similar observations in quenched @xmath1 lattice simulations had been reported by chandrasekharan and christ  @xcite . for @xmath0 lattice gluodynamics , where the polyakov loop is real ,",
    "it was predicted that the chiral condensate stays non - zero , @xmath4 , for all temperatures @xmath5 in the sector with a negative average polyakov loop , @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite came to a different result .",
    "these authors used the spectral gap in the spectrum of the dirac operator as an order parameter for the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "it was found that the spectral gap opens up at one single temperature @xmath7 in all three @xmath8 sectors .    in @xmath0 gluodynamics",
    "this question has not been clarified before . in this case",
    "the behavior may be completely different . indeed , there are pure vacuum gauge field configurations with @xmath9 for which the dirac operator has trivial zero modes for periodic fermionic boundary conditions .",
    "contrary to @xmath1 , for @xmath0 ( as well as for any even number of colors ) through a non - periodic @xmath10 gauge transformation with @xmath11 this is equivalent to the existence of zero modes for antiperiodic fermion boundary conditions in the case of @xmath12 . in the light of this argument , we shall examine whether stephanov s prediction for the dirac spectrum remains valid in the case of @xmath0 gluodynamics in the deconfined phase .",
    "preliminary results were presented in  @xcite .",
    "we base our study on neuberger s overlap dirac operator  @xcite .",
    "our interest will be concentrated on its spectrum , how it is related to the average polyakov loop , and how this is reflected by the localization properties of the modes in various parts of the spectrum .",
    "because of the index theorem  @xcite , the zero modes give us easy access to the topological charge @xmath13 of the lattice configurations , which is sufficient to calculate the topological susceptibility . in our present work , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , we will not exploit the capability of the overlap dirac operator to provide us with a tool to analyse the topological charge density  @xcite .",
    "a first study of the overlap dirac operator @xmath14 in @xmath0 gluodynamics at finite temperature has been undertaken by the authors of ref .",
    "they have used the usual wilson gauge field action which means that for the same lattice spacing their configurations are substantially more rough than ours .",
    "we compare our results with theirs at several places in the following .",

    "[ sec : localization ] the localization properties of the dirac eigenfunctions are described in the confined and deconfined phase , and the dependence on the polyakov loop is pointed out for the latter . in sect .",
    "[ sec : volume_and_discretization ] we assess the volume and lattice - spacing dependence of all discussed observables . in a separate sect .",
    "[ sec : edwards ] we consider an exceptional , relatively well separated part of the non - zero modes with very small eigenvalues . after a discussion of topological susceptibility , spectral density and localization for the case of zero temperature in sect .",
    "[ sec : zero_temperature ] , a summary is given in sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "in an initial study , partly reported at lattice 2007  @xcite , we have analyzed ensembles of @xmath15 statistically independent @xmath0 configurations , generated in the quenched approximation with the tadpole improved symanzik action on lattices of size @xmath16 .",
    "this action is known to suppress dislocations , that would lead to unphysical near - to - zero modes of the wilson - dirac operator .",
    "these are highly unwanted because they lead to difficulties to choose a uniform @xmath17 parameter ( see below ) .",
    "the form of the action is : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the plaquette and @xmath21 rectangular loop terms in the action , @xmath22 .",
    "the factor @xmath23 is the _ input _ tadpole factor .",
    "it is selfconsistently determined from @xmath24 computed at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "the deconfining phase transition , which is of second order for @xmath0 gluodynamics , is not easy to locate precisely  @xcite because of strong finite volume effects .",
    "we have approximately determined the critical @xmath25 on lattices of size @xmath16 , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath26 .",
    "this corresponds to a ratio @xmath27  @xcite .    to check for finite spatial volume effects",

    "we have simulated the neighbourhood of the transition on a finer lattice , with @xmath31 , for which a critical @xmath32 was found in simulations on lattices with a spatial extent @xmath33 .",
    "for these @xmath34 lattices our actual measurements were performed only at one temperature very close to @xmath2 in the confinement phase .",
    "the parameters of the lattices used in this study and the respective statistics are reported in table  [ tbl : sim_det ] .",

    "the general tendency of a spectral gap is decreasing with increasing volume .",
    "the interesting question is whether it has an infinite - volume limit different from zero .",
    "one can see that for @xmath39 the spectral gap decreases very steeply with increasing volume , starting from values like @xmath40 on lattices of size @xmath41 .",
    "the gap is already less than @xmath42 for @xmath43 , eventually turning to zero in the infinite - volume limit . at higher temperature , @xmath44",
    ", we also see that the `` old '' gap @xmath45 decreases with increasing volume , although not so fast .",
    "still , we can not exclude that the fate of the spectral gap is the same at the higher temperature .",
    "thus , the old definition of the spectral gap gives some support to the conclusion made in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the deconfinement phase of @xmath0 gluodynamics the chiral condensate is nonzero , at least up to some specific temperature , even in the @xmath38 sector .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig17 ] the conventional spectral gap @xmath45 is also shown for @xmath46 .",

    "the same is valid for the data set at @xmath39 for @xmath52 shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig17 ] .    for the same physical 3-volume , the gap increases with increasing temperature only in the case of @xmath38 . for the negative polyakov loop sector the tendency is reverse , corresponding to the increasing spectral density .     for @xmath52 , as defined in section [ sec :",

    "let us now turn to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig18 ] where results for the `` new '' definition @xmath53 of the spectral gap , excluding the small eigenvalues of the near - zero modes , are presented .",
    "now we see a strong indication for a convergence of the spectral gap @xmath53 to a finite intercept at @xmath54 for both temperatures .",
    "note that for @xmath39 only eigenvalues @xmath55 have been excluded in this way , a value substantially below the value of the new emerging gap .",
    "thus , excluding the near - zero modes leads to a definition of the spectral gap @xmath53 , such that it stays non - zero in the limit @xmath56 for @xmath38 at both temperatures @xmath5 .    summarizing our findings presented in this section we confirm the existence , at @xmath57 , of particular modes with small non - zero eigenvalues which are most probably related to topological objects , similar to the zero modes .",
    "so it is natural to consider them separately from the other ( bulk ) non - zero modes .",
    "we are planning to enter a further study of their properties in the near future .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) at approximately equal @xmath74 , we see an essential difference : at non - zero temperature the ipr close to @xmath75 is substantially higher .     at @xmath67 for four different @xmath76-values . ]",
    "after a first overlap study of topological aspects of @xmath0 pure gauge theory at finite temperature  @xcite , based on the wilson gauge field action , we returned to these topics .",
    "we have performed measurements of the topological susceptibility , the spectral density and the localization properties of fermionic eigenmodes with the help of the overlap dirac operator in finite temperature @xmath0 gluodynamics , simulated with the tadpole - improved symanzik action .",
    "we found that the topological susceptibility in the confinement phase is almost independent of temperature .",
    "it starts slowly to decrease in the deconfinement phase , in agreement with previous results  @xcite which were obtained with the wilson gauge field action and an improved gluonic definition of the topological charge density .",
    "in contrast to the other quantities , we did not find systematic effects of the sign of the averaged polyakov loop on the topological susceptibility .    while these results ( see sect .  [ sec : topological_susceptibility ] ) could have been expected , the remaining observations concerning the spectral properties might come as a surprise , if not at a qualitative then at a quantitative level .",
    "assuming antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermionic fields throughout this paper we have discussed the behavior of the chiral condensate defined via the banks - casher relation below and above the phase transition .",
    "a qualitatively different behavior of the spectral density has been observed at @xmath5 for ensembles having opposite sign of the polyakov loop @xmath77 ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : spectral_density ] ) .",
    "the spectral density is decreasing with rising temperature for @xmath38 until it is finally disrupting around @xmath78 . on the other hand , for @xmath46",
    "the density begins to rise with increasing temperature .    although the spectral gap @xmath45 , defined as the average of the lowest non - zero eigenvalue , as a function of temperature shows qualitative agreement with respective data for @xmath1 gauge theory ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) we observed that the respective volume dependence is completely different .",
    "we found that @xmath45 tends fast to zero with increasing volume for @xmath38 at @xmath39 and for @xmath46 for both @xmath39 and 1.55 in contrast to the situation in @xmath1 where a rather weak volume dependence of the gap was observed in both real and complex @xmath77 sectors .",
    "increasing of the gap @xmath47 with increasing temperature for @xmath38 and fixed lattice size is explained by the strong volume dependence of the number of near - zero modes as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig16 ] .",
    "we are making measurements on the lattice , with @xmath79 defining its physical size , which decreases with increasing temperature , resulting in a decreasing number of near - zero modes .",
    "the consequence is that not each lattice configuration has these modes .",
    "this in turn makes the _ ensemble average _",
    "@xmath47 to increase with temperature .",
    "the localization properties of the eigenmodes have been investigated in terms of the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , and the dependence of the average ipr on volume and discretization has been monitored all over the lower part of the spectrum ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : localization ] .",
    "we repeat here only two remarkable facts . at first",
    ", sizeable lattice spacing effects have been found only for the zero modes ( close to @xmath2 ) which is pointing to a dimensionality @xmath80 .",
    "second , at @xmath46 , the eigenmodes responsible for the non - vanishing chiral condensate above @xmath2 , that are filling the region up to @xmath81 , are very delocalized compared to the isolated modes that exist in that spectral range for @xmath38 .",
    "special considerations have been devoted in sect .",
    "[ sec : edwards ] to the near - zero modes found in the sub - ensemble with @xmath38 .",
    "the spectral density has been divided into an interval with small eigenvalues and the rest with all larger eigenvalues , motivated by the observation that for large enough temperatures @xmath82 these two parts of the spectrum become well separated , whereas a small number of near - zero modes still exists .",
    "the topological susceptibility ( which had been defined through the total topological charge @xmath13 obtained by counting the zero modes alone ) now has been compared with the density of topological objects defined _ including _ the near - zero modes .",
    "good agreement was found .",
    "this justifies the dilute - gas approximation , @xmath83 with charge @xmath84 objects .",
    "this is corroborated by the observation that the multiplicity of all topological objects follows the poisson distribution with reasonable accuracy as indicated by fig .",
    "[ fig : fig15 ] and was reported earlier in ref .",
    "further , the percentage of near - zero modes among the lower part of the spectrum ( _ i.e. _ including also the true zero - modes ) has been measured for different temperatures and volumes , see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig16 ] . it was found to rise with increasing volume , and the apparent temperature suppression observed in our measurements might be mainly explained as a volume effect .",
    "based on all these observations , emphasizing the special role of the near - zero modes , an alternative definition of the spectral gap @xmath53 _ excluding _ the near - zero modes has been proposed . following this definition , a non - vanishing infinite - volume limit of @xmath85 in the deconfined phase _ at all temperatures _",
    "@xmath5 now seems possible for the @xmath38 sub - ensemble , in clear distinction to the other definition and , as we have seen , to the @xmath46 sub - ensemble .",
    "then we end up with an unusual situation in the temperature interval @xmath86 : a finite density of the near - zero modes coexists with a gap between these modes and the bulk of the spectrum .",
    "whether we really may speak about broken chiral symmetry depends on a nonvanishing infinite - volume limit of the spectral density @xmath87 at @xmath75 .",
    "otherwise we could ignore the presence of the near - zero modes for this question and consider the new definition @xmath53 of the spectral gap as a proper one . in any case",
    ", more studies of the thermodynamical limit are necessary in order to confirm or reject the possibility to reconcile , in that limit , the restoration of chiral symmetry , @xmath88 , with a gap @xmath89 .",
    "it shall be noted that by now , the `` kinematic '' understanding for the relation between chiral symmetry breaking ( and restoration ) and the sign of an eventually nonzero value of the polyakov loop ( or , equivalently , on the change of the boundary conditions in the dirac operator ) is much more developed than at the time when our study was begun  @xcite .    a series of papers  @xcite discusses the connection between the spectrum of a ( fairly general ) dirac operator and the breaking of center symmetry , _ i.e. _ the emergence of a nonvanishing polyakov loop .",
    "the most concise quantity in this respect is the `` dual quark condensate '' defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fourier transform of the standard quark condensate @xmath90 \\rangle\\ ] ] with respect to the angle @xmath91 modifying the boundary condition of the dirac operator @xmath92 .",
    "a `` fat polyakov loop '' formed out of singly wrapped pathes is obtained as the lowest ( @xmath93 ) fourier component .",
    "higher fourier components correspond to multiply wrapped polyakov loops .",
    "the condition for a nonvanishing `` fat '' polyakov loop is a nonvanishing periodic component @xmath94 in the fermionic spectral density , in other words , a nontrivial response of the spectral density to the change of the boundary conditions .",
    "a microscopic explanation of the onset of such a sensitivity of the dirac spectrum to the type of boundary conditions in the context of a nonvanishing polyakov loop of either sign needs to be worked out .",
    "what comes to mind is the interplay of holonomy and topology of dyons  @xcite .",
    "this difference is accompanied by a different localization behavior of the lowest fermionic eigenmodes in the two sectors .",
