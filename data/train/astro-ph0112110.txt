    "reach et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested that the strong emission in the 11.3@xmath86 c - h bending mode might be due to increased hydrogenation of the smc pahs , which might perhaps be related to the fact that the gas phase c abundance ( relative to h ) is a factor of 10 lower than in the milky way ( dufour 1984 ; russell & dopita 1992 ) . to test this hypothesis , we have considered a pah model where we assume the same intrinsic band strengths for c - c and c - h stretching and bending modes , but with a higher h / c ratio ( which would be appropriate for pahs with more open structures ) :    @xmath157    we find that the best - fitting spectra ( see figure [ fig : hh2csmcb1 ] ) do lead to improvements over those calculated from pahs with a lower degree of hydrogenation ( see eq.[[eq : nmlh2c ] ] ) .",
    "however , this high h / c model still fails to attain the observed 11.3@xmath86/7.7@xmath86 band ratio even taking all pahs to be neutral ( see figure [ fig : hh2csmcb1]c ) .",
    "an increase in @xmath42 and/or @xmath43 ( implying a larger @xmath49 [ see figure [ fig : ionfrac ] ] and a smaller h / c [ see eq.[eq : high2c ] ] ) does not help since this would lead to a decrease at the 11.3@xmath86 band . while a slight decrease in @xmath42 and/or @xmath43 ( implying a smaller @xmath49 [ see figure [ fig : ionfrac ] ] and a higher h / c [ see eq.[eq : high2c ] ] ) would result in an increase at the 11.3@xmath86 band , this results in a decrease at the 6.2 , and 7.7@xmath86 bands and thus does not work either since this model is already deficient in the 6.2 and 7.7@xmath86 bands ( see figure [ fig : hh2csmcb1]f ) .    in comparison with normal pahs , super - hydrogenated pahs would produce a stronger 3.3@xmath86 c - h stretching feature , a broad plateau below the 3.4 and 3.5@xmath86 features ( bernstein , sandford , & allamandola 1996 ; pauzat & ellinger 2001 ) , and a stronger 6.2@xmath86 c - c stretching feature ( beegle , wdowiak , & harrison 2001 ) .",
    "future high - resolution observations of smc  b1#1 particularly at the 3@xmath86 region , will provide us with more information about the pah hydrogenation .    since milky way pahs with @xmath15825 c atoms",
    "are expected to be already essentially fully hydrogenated ( tielens et al .",
    "1987 ; allamandola , tielens , & barker 1989 ; allain , leach , & sedlmayr 1996 ) , an increase in the h / c ratio in the smc would require that the pahs have more open structures than in the milky way .",
    "there is no apparent reason to expect this difference in pah structure between the milky way and smc .",
    "based on an analysis of the 1015@xmath86 pah out - of - plane c - h bending features , vermeij et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argue that the pah emission in the smc  b1#1  cloud is dominated by compact pahs , i.e. , relatively low hydrogenation . in conclusion",
    ", it appears unlikely that the large 11.3@xmath86/7.7@xmath86 band ratio in smc  b1#1  is attributable to enhanced hydrogenation .      in previous sections the interstellar radiation field",
    "is taken to have the same spectrum as the mmp solar neighbourhood field .",
    "although this assumption seems reasonable for the overall smc where the extinction is small ( @xmath159 ; see  [ sec : smcsed ] ) , the starlight incident on the @xmath160 molecular cloud surface will be subject to considerable reddening inside the cloud ( @xmath161 ; see  [ sec : smcb1sed ] ) .",
    "the reddened starlight will affect the pah emission bands in two ways : ( 1 ) pah molecules will be excited to lower temperatures ; ( 2 ) the probability of being ( positively ) charged ( via photoelectron ejection ) will be smaller .",
    "one therefore would expect an increase in the 11.3@xmath86/7.7@xmath86 band ratio .",
    "could reddening of the starlight explain the observed 11.3@xmath86/7.7@xmath86 band ratio in smc  b1#1 ?    to investigate this , we consider a trial reddened radiation field with the spectrum shown in figure [ fig : reddenedisrf]a , with a factor of @xmath03 reduction in the relative intensity at @xmath162 relative to @xmath163 .",
    "we have calculated the temperature probability distribution functions for pahs excited by this radiation field with @xmath37 .",
    "the mid - ir emission spectrum is entirely due to single - photon heating , so the emission per pah simply scales as @xmath9 ; the spectrum in the lower panel of figure [ fig : reddenedisrf ] is calculated for @xmath164 .",
    "it is seen in figure [ fig : reddenedisrf]b that even for pure neutral pahs , reddened starlight results in an emission spectrum which is very similar to the pure neutral pah spectrum in the unreddened radiation field in figure [ fig : smcb1]f , and is unable to reproduce the observed 11.3@xmath86/7.7@xmath86 band ratio .",
    "we conclude that excitation by reddened starlight can not account for the 11.3@xmath86/7.7@xmath86 band ratio observed toward smc  b1#1 .",
    "individual pahs differ considerably in the relative strengths of different vibration bands . ld01",
    "discussed laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations of band strengths for selected pah molecules and ions , but argued that spectroscopy of various objects in the milky way was best reproduced if the 6.2 , 7.7 and 8.6@xmath86 band strengths were increased by factors of @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 respectively , relative to the average laboratory and theoretical values .",
    "these enhancement factors were used for the models shown in figures [ fig : smcb1][fig : reddenedisrf ] .",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether the observed spectrum indicates that the band strengths for the pahs in smc  b1#1  differ from the band strengths which characterize pahs in the milky way .",
    "if so , what band strengths give the best fit to the smc  b1#1  spectrum ?    in figure",
    "[ fig : e1smcb1 ] we show the emission calculated from a model with @xmath168 , @xmath169 . for @xmath67",
    "this model ( see parameters in table [ tab : para ] ) is in very good agreement with the observations , with @xmath170 .",
    "the agreement is considerably better than for the models considered in figures [ fig : smcb1][fig : reddenedisrf ] .",
    "note that these adjusted band strengths are in fact _ closer _ to the average laboratory values than are the `` milky way '' band strengths .",
    "alternatively , the apparent need for a change in intrinsic band strength might be due to the oversimplification of the `` astronomical '' pah model in which we do not distinguish anions ( pah@xmath171 ) and multiply - charged cations ( pah@xmath172 ) from singly - charged cations ( pah@xmath173 ) .",
    "bauschlicher & bakes ( 2000 ) predict that the 6.2 , 7.7@xmath86 c - c stretching modes and the 8.6@xmath86 in - plane c - h bending mode are even more enhanced for pah@xmath172 than pah@xmath173 .",
    "pah@xmath171 anions have band strengths intermediate between those of neutrals ( strong 3.3@xmath86 c - h stretching and 11.3 , 11.9 , 12.7@xmath86 out - of - plane c - h bending modes ) and pah@xmath173 cations ( strong 6.2 , 7.7@xmath86 c - c stretching and 8.6@xmath86 c - h in - plane bending mode ) . unfortunately , no experimental measurements have yet been made for multiply - ionized pahs .",
    "available evidence indicates that the ir properties of pah@xmath171 anions closely resemble those of pah@xmath173 cations except for the very strong 3.3@xmath5 m c - h stretch enhancement in the anion ( szczepanski , wehlburg , & vala 1995 ; hudgins et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "laboratory measurements show that pahs have an absorption peak due to the @xmath174-@xmath175 electronic transition in the vicinity of 20002500 , and in the grain model considered here ( ld01 ) it is assumed that the interstellar pah mixture contributes absorption with the wavelength - dependence of the 2175feature observed on sightlines in the milky way and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the pah abundance required to reproduce the observed ir emission features in the milky way ( c / h@xmath176 ) is such that we posit that pahs in fact contribute most of the observed 2175  feature .",
    "the predicted extinction excess at 2175  is ( see ld01 ) @xmath177 our best - fitting model has @xmath178 and @xmath179 ( see  [ sec : smcb1sed ] ) .",
    "therefore we predict @xmath180 for sightlines through smc  b1#1 .",
    "we note that the @xmath181 value derived here is a lower limit since @xmath182 carbonaceous grains may also contribute to the 2175  hump .",
    "this prediction appears to conflict with the fact that most smc extinction curves have no detectable 2175  hump ( prvot et al .",
    "1984 ) . however , as pointed out by reach et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , there may be regional variations in the smc extinction curve .",
    "we note that the sight lines which show no 2175  hump all pass through the smc bar regions of active star formation ( prvot et al .",
    "1984 ; rodrigues et al .  1997 ; gordon & clayton 1998 ) .",
    "there is at least one line of sight ( sk 143@xmath183avz 456 ) with an extinction curve with a strong 2175  hump ( lequeux et al .",
    "1982 ; prvot et al .  1984 ; bouchet et al .  1985 ; thompson et al .",
    "1988 ; rodrigues et al .  1997 ; gordon & clayton 1998 ) .",
    "this sightline passes through the smc wing , a region with much weaker star formation ( gordon & clayton 1998 ) .",
    "it is possible that the smc  b1#1  dust , just like the dust toward sk 143 , has been exposed to a less harsh environment than that in the smc bar regions where the uv extinction has been measured , and where the radiation and shocks associated with massive stars might have destroyed pahs .",
    "finally , we also note that _ both _ the 2175  hump ( fitzpatrick 1985 ) _ and _ pah emission features ( sturm et al .",
    "2000 ) are present in the 30 dor region in the lmc , another low - metallicity environment ( @xmath01/4 of that in the milky way ; dufour 1984 ) .",
    "in contrast to the milky way galaxy , the smc is characterized by a lower metallicity , a lower dust - to - gas ratio , and an absence of the 2175  hump on most sightlines with measured uv extinction ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "therefore , the smc provides an ideal laboratory to study dust in an environment quite different from the milky way .",
    "we have modelled the ir spectral energy distribution for the smc as a whole ( averaged over a 6.25 deg@xmath73 area ) (  [ sec : smcsed ] ) .",
    "we have also modelled the ir emission spectrum of the quiescent molecular cloud smc  b1#1  (  [ sec : smcb1sed ] ) .",
    "our principal results are :    1 .",
    "the dust ir emission from a 6.25 deg@xmath73 region including the smc bar and eastern wing is well reproduced by a model with @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath93 using the smc dust model of weingartner & draine ( 2001a ) .",
    "this dust has a very low pah abundance , with c / h @xmath186 0.2ppm ( @xmath187 of the smc interstellar c abundance ) incorporated into pahs .",
    "the dust - weighted mean radiation intensity is @xmath188 , but the starlight intensity must have a broad distribution ranging from @xmath189 to @xmath101 (  [ sec : smcsed ] ) .",
    "the ir emission from the molecular cloud smc  b1#1  can be reproduced by a dust model consisting of silicates , graphite , and pahs with @xmath141 illuminated by starlight with a power law distribution @xmath190 , @xmath191 (  [ sec : smcb1sed ] ) .",
    "the required pah abundance in smc  b1#1  is 1.5@xmath192 , or @xmath03% of the smc interstellar c abundance .",
    "3 .   the observed 11.3@xmath193/7.7@xmath193 and 6.2@xmath193/7.7@xmath193 band ratios for smc  b1#1  fall outside the `` allowed '' region predicted for the milky way pah model ( see figures 16 , 17 of draine & li 2001 ) . in ",
    "[ sec : mwmod ] ,  [ sec : h2c ] , and ",
    "[ sec : reddenedisrf ] , we examine the possibility that this could be due to ( 1 ) an enhanced neutral fraction , ( 2 ) an enhanced h / c ratio for the pahs in smc  b1#1 , or ( 3 ) reddening of the radiation field to which the pahs in smc  b1#1  are exposed , but none of these scenarios successfully accounts for the observed 515@xmath86 spectrum .",
    "we instead conclude that the intrinsic ir band strengths for the pah mixture in smc  b1#1  differ from the band strengths adopted for milky way pah mixtures (  [ sec : ir_band_strengths ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the pah mixture in smc  b1#1  differs in detail from the pah mixtures present in a number of milky way regions .",
    "the band strengths suggested by the smc  b1#1  spectrum are close to `` laboratory '' band strengths .",
    "the pah abundance in smc  b1#1  exceeds that in the smc bar by a factor @xmath194 ( c / h=1.5 ppm vs @xmath186 0.2ppm ) .",
    "while the average smc extinction curve has no detectable 2175  hump , we predict a 2175  extinction excess of @xmath195 for the dust in smc  b1#1  (  [ sec : extinction ] ) .",
    "two types of measurements would be of great value to test our dust model : ( 1 ) uv extinction measurements for sightlines through or near smc  b1#1  to test for the predicted 2175  feature ; ( 2 ) @xmath196 spectrophotometry of other regions in the smc where uv extinction measurements place a strong upper limit on the 2175  feature  the present model predicts that pah emission should not be seen from such regions .",
