    "t tau is the eponymous pre - main sequence star ( joy 1945 ) , but observational investigations over the last 20 years have revealed that it is an exceptional member of the class .",
    "many of the young stars in the taurus dark clouds are multiple systems , and in this respect t tau is not atypical ( ghez et al .",
    "1993 ; leinert et al .",
    "1993 ; simon et al .",
    "it consists of t tau north ( t tau n ) , the star seen in visible light at v @xmath410 ( herbig & bell 1988 ) , and t tau south ( t tau s ) , discovered in the infrared by dyck , simon & zuckerman ( 1982 ) , at a projected separation @xmath4100 au ( 0.@xmath57 ) .",
    "t tau s is itself a binary , with a projected separation of 7 au ( 0.@xmath505 ) ( koresko 2000 ) .",
    "our observations do not resolve the 0.@xmath505 t tau s binary , so for the purpose of this paper we will refer to it as t tau s.    the t tau system is remarkable in part because the physical nature of t tau s is unknown .",
    "it dominates the total system flux in the thermal ir , has a total luminosity two times that of t tau n ( ghez et al .",
    "1991 , hereafter g91 ) , but has never been detected in visible light to limiting v magnitude of 19.6 ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "t tau s also shows pronounced variability in the infrared .",
    "g91 discovered that it flared by @xmath4 2 magnitudes in the near and thermal ir in 1990 .",
    "they concluded that t tau s experienced enhanced accretion , similar to an fu orionis outburst .",
    "kobayashi et al . ( 1994 ) and simon et al . (",
    "1996 ) reported that the k band flux of t tau s had decreased to the pre - flare value in the early 1990 s .",
    "t tau s is now regarded as a member of a small class of stars known as the infrared companions ( ircs)(koresko et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter k97 ) .",
    "ircs are companions to visible t tauri stars , are very luminous in the ir , and show pronounced variability .",
    "the near ir colors of ircs imply a color temperature @xmath6 1500 k , lower than possible for a stellar photosphere .",
    "k97 suggest that the ircs are young stars seen through strong extinction and are experiencing episodic accretion from their complex surrounding environment .",
    "spectral diagnostics in the near infrared provide probes to study extinction and accretion in ircs .",
    "whittet et al . (",
    "1988 ) reported that the optical depth of the 3@xmath0 m ice - band absorption feature , @xmath7 , correlates well with extinction in visible light , a@xmath8 .",
    "sato et al . ( 1990 ) discovered the 3 @xmath0 m ice feature in absorption toward the unresolved t tau system .",
    "leinert et al .",
    "( 1996 ) monitored the ice - band optical depth toward the haro 6 - 10 binary , an irc system similar to t tau , and found that both components varied in @xmath7 , possibly attributable to variations in extinction along the line of sight .",
    "herbst et al . ( 1995 ; 1996 ; 1997 ) detected h@xmath3 emission in the _ v_=1 - 0 s(1 ) line ( 2.12 @xmath0 m ) in the haro 6 - 10 and uy aur ircs .",
    "the herbst et al .",
    "( 1996 ) observation of t tau indicated peaks of unresolved emission at the positions of t tau n and s. the absence of emission in the _ v_=2 - 1 s(1 ) ( 2.25 @xmath0 m ) transition in these sources suggests a line ratio consistent with a shock origin rather than fluorescence .",
    "the observed h@xmath3 emission could be caused by accretion shocks from the infall of material onto the star .",
    "prato & simon ( 1997 ) used br@xmath2 line emission as a surrogate for h@xmath9 to distinguish between the classical and weak - lined t tauri stars and muzzerole , hartmann & calvet ( 1998 ) showed that the br@xmath2 line luminosity in classical t tauris correlates well with accretion luminosity determined from blue continuum excess .    to determine if the observed variability of t tau s could be caused by variable extinction , we made angularly resolved observations of the near ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of t tau n and s to test for variation in ice - band absorption on three occasions . additionally , we obtained angularly resolved k - band spectra of t tau n and s to study br@xmath2 and h@xmath3 accretion diagnostics , and if possible , to detect evidence of the photosphere of t tau s.",
    "ice - band observations were taken on ut 1998 december 11 , 1999 november 17 , and 2000 january 27 at nasa s infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) during scheduled observing time ( december ) and as part of the irtf service observing program ( november & january ) .",
    "we used nsfcam , the facility near ir camera , which is equipped with a 256 @xmath10 256 insb array .",
    "all of our observations were taken with the 0.@xmath5056/pixel plate scale . to measure the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the ice - band",
    ", we used the k ( 2.2 @xmath0 m ) and l@xmath11 ( 3.8 @xmath0 m ) broadband filters and the circularly variable filter ( cvf ) , which has a spectral band pass of 2% , set at 2.4 , 2.9 , 3.05 and 3.4 @xmath0 m . in december 1998",
    "we also used a cvf setting at 3.6 @xmath0 m and the h - band ( 1.65 @xmath0 m ) filter . to freeze the seeing",
    ", we took 100 0.1 second exposures in the k and l@xmath11 filters , 200 0.1 sec exposures at all of the cvf filters except 2.9 @xmath0 m .",
    "the relatively weak flux of t tau s in the h band and atmospheric absorption at 2.9 @xmath0 m required 400 0.1 sec exposures .",
    "figure 1 is a contour plot of t tau n and s at 3.05 @xmath0 m , demonstrating the resolution of the system in the ice - band .",
    "16 tau and @xmath12 tau were the photometric standards for the broadband and cvf observations , respectively .",
    "the zero - point fluxes for the cvf observations were determined using a polynomial fit to the broadband ir fluxes of vega , as reported in table 7.5 of _",
    "allen s astrophysical quantities _ ( tokunaga 1999 ) .",
    "we determined the point spread function ( psf ) at each of the observed wavelengths by making shift - and - add ( s / a ) images from a series of short exposures of the photometric standards .",
    "the flux ratios of t tau n and s at the observed wavelengths were derived using two different binary fitting procedures ; the results were always consistent to within 1@xmath1 .",
    "a discussion of the binary fitting routines will be included in a forthcoming paper ( beck et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    our k - band ( 2.05 to 2.4 @xmath0 m )",
    "spectral observations of the t tau system were made at the univerisity of hawaii 2.2 meter telescope on ut 1996 november 2 with kspec , the facility near ir spectrometer ( hodapp et al . 1994 ; 1996 ) .",
    "this work closely followed s / a observations of t tau in the k - band on ut 1996 october 26 at the irtf which were subsequently used to flux - calibrate the kspec spectra .",
    "the kspec detector is a 1024 @xmath10 1024 pixel hgcdte array with a plate scale of 0.@xmath5167/pixel .",
    "we used the tip - tilt adaptive optics system with the telescope in its f/31 configuration . with a slit width of 0.@xmath58",
    ", we obtained a resolution of @xmath4760 at 2.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "the slit was aligned at the position angle of the t tau n - s system so that we acquired spectra of both stars simultaneously in a 35 minute exposure .",
    "we observed the spectrum of hr 1377 , a b8 single star , immediately following t tau to provide psfs in the cross - dispersion direction as well as a reference spectrum to correct that of t tau for telluric absorption and instrumental effects .",
    "the spectra of t tau n and s were extracted by fitting , at each wavelength , model binaries constructed from the psf of hr 1377 , constrained by knowledge of the binary separation .",
    "the total amplitude and flux ratio of the binary model which yielded the best fit in the least squares sense was used to derive the individual spectral amplitudes of t tau n and s at each wavelength .",
    "the spectra of t tau n and s were divided by that of hr 1377 with the effects of its broad br@xmath2 absorption removed following the procedure described by greene & meyer ( 1995 ) . in order to restore the true form of the spectrum , we multiplied by a black - body curve of temperature 11,400 k , that of a b8 star ( drilling & landolt 1999 ) .",
    "the flux ratio of t tau s to n of these spectra at 2.2 @xmath0 m , 0.18@xmath130.01 , is in excellent agreement with the value of 0.16@xmath130.03 measured by the s / a observations in the k - band six days earlier at the irtf .",
    "we applied the irtf flux calibration to the spectra and show the final results in figure 2 .",
    "figure 3 is an expanded plot of the 2.10 to 2.20 @xmath0 m region , which also shows a polynomial fit to the continuum .",
    "figure 4 presents the angularly resolved ice - band sed of t tau n and s measured on ut 1998 december 11 . by fitting a smooth continuum distribution to the sed , we derive optical depths for the ice feature , @xmath7 , of 0.1@xmath130.1 toward t tau n and 0.5@xmath130.1 toward t tau s. if we consider the total unresolved system , we derive @xmath7 = 0.3@xmath130.1 , consistent with sato et al.s ( 1990 ) value of 0.29@xmath130.02 .",
    "this agreement may , however , be fortuitous considering the photometric variability of the t tau system and apparent variability of @xmath7 ( g91 ; beck et al .",
    "figure 5 shows the ice band seds of t tau s for all three of our observations .",
    "the depth of the ice - band absorption decreased between december 1998 and january 2000 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the observed change in @xmath7 is significant at the 2@xmath1 level and is associated with an increase in the near ir flux ( table 1 ) .",
    "we do not detect a statistically significant change in ice - band optical depth toward t tau n.    it is useful to relate @xmath7 and the more familiar extinction in the visible , a@xmath8 . at this time",
    "relationships between @xmath7 and a@xmath8 are available only for stars seen through molecular clouds ( whittet et al .",
    "1988 ; teixeira & emerson 1999 ) and their applicability to the denser circumstellar regions considered here is uncertain ( see also  4 ) . using whittet et al.s relation , @xmath7 = [ m(@xmath14 where m = 0.093@xmath130.001 and @xmath15 = 3.3@xmath130.1 , we determine a@xmath8 = 4@xmath134 mag toward t tau n and 9@xmath132 toward t tau s on 1998 december 11 . on 1999",
    "november 17 and 2000 january 27 the corresponding visual extinctions to t tau s were 7@xmath132 and 5@xmath132 mag .",
    "we can not use the relation derived by teixeira & emerson because it requires the full width at half maximum of the ice - band absorption and our cvf observations were too widely spaced to measure this .",
    "the k - band spectrum of t tau n ( figure 2 ) shows prominent br@xmath2 emission and photospheric absorption lines of na ( 2.208 @xmath0 m ) , ca ( 2.264 @xmath0 m ) , and the co @xmath162 bands .",
    "visible light observations indicate that t tau n has a spectral type of k0 and is obscured by a@xmath171 ( cohen & kuhi 1979 ) .",
    "j@xmath18h and h@xmath18k colors , derived from photometry of t tau n appearing in kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) , also indicate a value of a@xmath171 .",
    "the photospheric absorption features detected in the k - band are consistent with a k0 spectral type , although the shallow depth of these features in the spectrum of t tau n requires a 2.2@xmath0 m continuum excess on the order of @xmath1970% of the stellar continuum ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the slope of our t tau n k - band spectrum implies an a@xmath20 of 10@xmath1812 magnitudes for an early k to late g type stellar spectrum .",
    "although complex nebulosity around t tau is evident in several studies ( e.g. stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ) , preferential scattering of the short wavelength light does not explain the discrepancy between the different estimates of a@xmath8 , since the near - ir colors also indicate low extinction .",
    "rather , it is likely that spectral structure in the infrared excess emission across the k - band is resposible for the observed difference .",
    "these considerations will be discussed in more detail in prato , greene & simon ( in preparation ) .",
    "figure 3 shows weak br@xmath2 and h@xmath3 _ v_=1 - 0 s(1 ) emission lines toward t tau s , at 3@xmath1 and 2@xmath1 significance , respectively , but no evidence for h@xmath3 emission in t tau n. table 2 gives the fluxes of these lines .",
    "approximately three years after our spectra were obtained davies et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also observed the angularly resolved k - band spectra of t tau n and s. kasper(2000 ) and kasper et al .",
    "( in preparation ) provide a detailed discussion of these spectra .",
    "their observation was made when t tau s was in an elevated flux state ( g91 ; beck et al .",
    "2000 ) , with a 2.2 @xmath0 m flux roughly triple the value we measured in october 1996 .",
    "they detected br@xmath2 emission toward both t tau n and s. their measured br@xmath2 flux of t tau s , 2.6@xmath130.3 @xmath10 10@xmath21 w m@xmath22 s@xmath23 , is @xmath24 higher than our value ( table 2 ) suggesting that its br@xmath2 flux may vary .",
    "the spectrum of t tau s presented in davies et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and kasper ( 2000 ) shows no evidence of h@xmath25 line emission .",
    "this could indicate that its h@xmath25 line emission varied in the three years between our observations .",
    "the h@xmath25 emission could , however , arise from an extended circumstellar environment around t tau s. in this case , the difference in line fluxes could be attributable to the different solid angles sampled , @xmath26 for our observation , and @xmath27 for the davies et al . spectrum .",
    "high resolution mapping observations are required to resolve this issue .",
    "the projected angular separation of ttau n and s is equivalent to only 100 au at a distance of 140 pc , but our observations show that there is significantly stronger ice - band absorption towards the irc .",
    "g91 and herbst et al . (",
    "1997 ) obtained the same result for absorption in the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature and derived visual extinctions towards t tau s of 4.6@xmath132.5 and 5.4@xmath130.5 mag for the two studies , respectively , consistent with our results in section 3.1 .",
    "our data from the three observations of the water - ice feature suggest an inverse correlation between the near ir flux and ice - band optical depth .",
    "while this has a natural explanation in terms of a decrease of obscuring material along the line of sight , there is a 1/6 probability that this ordering is the result of pairing of random data .",
    "hence , further observations are required to determine if this correlation is real .",
    "if t tau s is a young binary viewed through significant obscuration , the typical visual extinctions of 5 to 10 magnitudes derived from ice - band and silicate absorption features are not large enough to account for its observed near ir colors .",
    "k97 estimate that 35 magnitudes of extinction are necessary to redden a 5200 k black - body to @xmath4 800 k , the characteristic near ir color temperature of t tau s. however , 35 magnitudes of extinction should produce enormous ice - band and silicate absorption depths which are not observed .",
    "two explanations seem possible .",
    "it is likely that the flux that is observed at the line center of the ice and silicate features does not originate from the stellar photosphere , hence the absorption does not trace all of the material that is present toward the system .",
    "also , whether the size and composition of the dusty material near young stars , and the relations between a@xmath8 and the ice and silicate optical depths , are the same as in the interstellar medium is unknown and is of considerable interest .",
    "several possibilities for the geometry of the obscuring material in the t tau system can account for all or a part of the extinction and its variability observed toward t tau s. we may be observing t tau s through a tenuous extension of the disk of t tau n , which was detected in hco@xmath28(@xmath29 ) by hogerheijde et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and in 3 mm continuum emission by akeson et al . (",
    "1998 ) . the extinction variability could be caused by inhomogeneous material in the disk of t tau n moving through our line of sight , perhaps by keplerian rotation .",
    "the t tau n disk would have to lie within the 2:1 resonance to avoid truncation by tidal effects , corresponding to @xmath41/3 of the semi - major axis if t tau n and s have equal masses ( artymowicz et al .",
    "this would imply a separation of t tau n and s much greater than the projected separation of 100 au . the obscuring material observed toward t tau s",
    "may also be associated with a nearly edge - on disk around the 0.@xmath505 binary , with rotation again responsible for the variability .",
    "akeson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) do not detect any mm continuum emission around t tau s to a limiting flux of 9 mjy . however , tenuous material that would escape detection at 3 mm could still be resposible for the extinction toward the t tau s system . another possible explanation for the observed extinction is the episodic embedding and accretion of t tau s from a disk around the t tau n - s system ( k97 ) .",
    "the observed extinction and variability toward t tau s could arise from material which is not associated with a disk , but with the complex distribution of gas and dust surrounding the young triple system ( momose et al . 1996 ; schuster et al .",
    "1997 ; weintraub et al . 1999 ) . in this case",
    ", the absorbing material must have significant structure and large inhomogeneities in absorption on scales less than 100 au to account for the present small extinction toward t tau n. the irrregular dimming of t tau n by 3 - 4 visual magnitudes in the early 1900 s provides support for this scenario ( lozinskii 1949 ; beck & simon , in preparation ) .",
    "there are indications that variations in extinction do not provide the entire explanation for the ir variability of t tau s and the irc phenomenon .",
    "the flare discovered by g91 was essentially gray , with a flux increase of @xmath4 2 magnitudes between 2 and 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "detection of br@xmath2 emission associated with t tau s in both our and the kasper ( 2000 ) spectra indicates continuing accretion activity and evidence for variation in accretion rate .",
    "additionally , variability of h@xmath3 line emission would indicate that the flows that shock molecular gas in the environment of t tau s can vary on a timescale of a few years .",
    "the variability of ice - band optical depth and k - band emission features suggest that the near ir flux variation observed toward t tau s may be caused by changes in both extinction and accretion rate .",
    "frequent , simultaneous and high precision measurements of the ir spectral energy distribution , including measurement of the ice and silicate features , and the br@xmath2 and h@xmath3 emission lines , have the potential to clarify the nature of t tau s and the irc phenomenon . improvements in image quality through the techniques of adaptive optics , and the powerful new ir cameras and spectrometers at the major observatories offer the means for rapid progress .",
