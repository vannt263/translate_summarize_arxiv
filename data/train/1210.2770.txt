    "in the spring of 1936 , the famous mexican muralist david alfaro siqueiros @xcite organized an experimental painting workshop in new york : a group of artists focused in developing painting techniques through empirical experimentation of modern and industrial materials and tools . among the young artists attending the workshop was jackson pollock @xcite .",
    "they tested different lacquers and a number of experimental techniques .",
    "one of the techniques , named by siqueiros as a `` controlled accident , '' consisted in pouring layers of paint of different colors on top of each other . after a brief time , the paint from the lower layer emerged from bottom to top creating a relatively regular pattern of blobs .",
    "this technique led to the creation of explosion - inspired textures and catastrophic images .",
    "we conducted an analysis of this process .",
    "we experimentally reproduced the patterns `` discovered '' by siqueiros and analyzed the behavior of the flow .",
    "we found that the flow is driven by the well - known rayleigh taylor instability @xcite : different colors paints have different densities ; a heavy layer on top of a light one is an unstable configuration .",
    "the blobs and plumes that result from the instability create the aesthetically pleasing patterns .",
    "we discuss the importance of fluid mechanics in artistic creation .",
    "we used the same type of paints that siqueiros used .",
    "their physical properties are shown in table [ table_props ] . with these combinations ,",
    "both the reynolds and artwood numbers are small .",
    "the paint layers where dripping on top of a horizontal glass sheet .",
    "volumes of approximately 50 and 25 ml were deposited for the bottom and bottom layers , respectively .",
    "the flow was photographed with a computer - controlled hd digital camera ( finepix si pro , fujifilm ) , such that long term time sequences could be obtained .",
    "the time interval between photos was either 500 or 143 ms .",
    ".properties of the fluids and fluid combinations used .",
    "@xmath0 , is the artwood number and @xmath1 , is the reynolds number , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the velocity of the front and the thickness of the layer , respectively . [",
