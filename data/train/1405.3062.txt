    "the theory of quantum invariants of knots and links emerged in the middle of the eighties , after the fundamental work of jones . instead of the classical tools of topology , such as algebraic topology , used until then , this new class of invariants was derived from interactions of knot theory with other fields of mathematics , such as operator algebras and representation of quantum groups , and revealed close relationships with theoretical physics . although this gave rise to a whole new class of powerful tools in knot theory , we still lack a proper understanding of the topological information carried by quantum invariants .",
    "one way to attack this fundamental question is to exhibit explicit relationships with classical link invariants .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give such a relation , by showing how a certain reduction of the universal @xmath0 invariant is captured by milnor invariants .",
    "recall that milnor s @xmath2-invariants were defined by milnor in the fifties @xcite . given an @xmath3-component oriented , ordered link @xmath4 in @xmath5 , milnor invariants @xmath6 of @xmath4 are defined for each multi - index @xmath7 ( i.e. , any sequence of possibly repeating indices ) among @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , these @xmath9 are in general not well - defined integers , as their definition contains a rather intricate self - recurrent indeterminacy . in @xcite , habegger and lin showed that the indeterminacy in milnor invariants of a link is equivalent to the indeterminacy in representing it as the closure of a string link , which is a pure tangle without closed components , and that milnor invariants are actually well defined integer - valued invariants of string links .",
    "they also showed how the first non - vanishing milnor string link invariants of length @xmath10 can be assembled into a single milnor map @xmath11 .",
    "see section [ 2 ] for a review of string links and milnor invariants .",
    "milnor invariants constitute an important family of classical ( string ) link invariants , and their connection with quantum invariants has already been the subject of several works . the first attempt seem to be due to rozansky , who conjectured a formula relating milnor invariants to the jones polynomial @xcite .",
    "an important step was taken by habegger and masbaum , who showed explicitly in @xcite how milnor invariants are related to the kontsevich integral , which is universal among quantum invariants ; roughly speaking , they showed that , for an @xmath3-component string link @xmath4 with vanishing milnor invariants of length @xmath12 , we have @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the projection of the kontsevich integral onto the quotient space @xmath15 of @xmath16-labeled jacobi diagram modulo non - simply connected jacobi diagrams , and where @xmath17 is the milnor map of @xmath4 regarded as an element of @xmath15 . see section [ sec : hm ] for details .",
    "more recently , yasuhara and the first author gave explicit formulas expressing milnor invariants in terms of the homflypt polynomial of knots @xcite .",
    "the present paper exhibits another type of such relationships , involving the universal @xmath0 invariant . given a ribbon hopf algebra @xmath18 , reshetikhin and turaev defined an invariant of framed links colored by finite dimensional representations of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the universal invariant associated to @xmath18 has a universality property for the reshetikhin - turaev invariant , in the sense that it is defined for non colored objects , and is such that taking trace in the representations attached to the link components recovers the reshetikhin - turaev invariant @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the universal @xmath0 invariant , which is universal for the colored jones polynomial in the above sense .",
    "for an @xmath3-component framed string link @xmath4 , the universal @xmath0 invariant @xmath19 takes values in the @xmath3-fold completed tensor powers @xmath20 of the quantized enveloping algebra @xmath21 .",
    "the second author @xcite studied the universal @xmath0 invariant of several classes of _ bottom tangles _",
    "( ribbon , boundary , and brunnian ) which admit vanishing properties for milnor invariants . here",
    ", we can identify bottom tangles with string links via a fixed one - to - one correspondence , see @xcite .",
    "see section [ 3 ] for the definitions of @xmath21 and the universal @xmath0 invariant .",
    "our first main result , theorem [ sth2 ] , can be roughly stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath22 be the symmetric algebra of @xmath0 . using the pbw basis",
    ", we will define an isomorphism of @xmath23-modules ( see section [ 5.1 ] ) @xmath24 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and consider the projection @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the degree @xmath27 part of the graded algebra @xmath28 with respect to the length of the words in @xmath0 .    on the other hand , there is a graded algebra homomorphism @xmath29,\\ ] ] called _ the @xmath0 weight system _ , which is defined on the space @xmath30 of @xmath16-labeled jacobi diagram ( see section [ 4 ] for the definition ) .",
    "actually @xmath17 is contained in the space of tree jacobi diagrams , i.e. connected and simply connected jacobi diagrams , and the restriction of @xmath31 to the space of tree jacobi diagrams takes values in @xmath32 ; see lemma [ wcc ] .",
    "thus we can compare @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and obtain the following result .",
    "let @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath4 is a string link with vanishing milnor invariants of length @xmath12 , then we have @xmath36    here , and throughout the paper , we simply set @xmath37 for @xmath38 and an appropriate @xmath39 .",
    "note that the case @xmath40 of this statement is essentially well - known , see proposition [ sc ] .",
    "this result implies a certain ` concordance invariance'-type result for @xmath41 , stated in corollary [ cor : main ] , which implies in particular that @xmath41 is trivial for slice string links .",
    "there is also a variant of the above theorem , using another projection map @xmath42 onto a larger quotient of @xmath43 ; see remark [ rem : tbw ] .",
    "this provides another criterion for the universal @xmath0 invariant , which applies in particular to slice , boundary or ribbon string links .",
    "let @xmath4 be an @xmath3-component string link with vanishing milnor invariants .",
    "then we have @xmath44    this result supports strongly ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 1.5 ) , where the second author suggests that the universal @xmath0 invariant of a bottom tangle with vanishing milnor invariants is contained in a certain subalgebra of @xmath45 .",
    "as is often with milnor invariants , the proof of the first main theorem consists mainly of two steps : we first prove the result for milnor link - homotopy invariants , then deduce the general case using cabling operations . recall that the link - homotopy is the equivalence relation generated by self - crossing changes .",
    "habegger and lin showed that milnor invariants indexed by sequences with no repetition form a complete set of link - homotopy invariants for string links @xcite .",
    "we can thus consider the link - homotopy reduction @xmath46 of the milnor map @xmath47 ( see section [ subseq ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , we consider the projection of @xmath23-modules @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the subspace spanned by tensor products such that each tensorand is of degree @xmath50 , that is , roughly speaking , tensor products of @xmath51 s and elements of @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that the restriction of the @xmath0 weight system @xmath31 to the space of tree jacobi diagrams with non - repeated labels takes values in this space @xmath52 .",
    "thus , similarly as before , we can compare @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and obtain the following second main result .",
    "let @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath4 is a string link with vanishing milnor link - homotopy invariants of length @xmath12 , then we have @xmath55    in order to prove the latter , one of the key results is a ` link - homotopy invariance'-type result for the map @xmath56 ( proposition [ s241 ] ) .",
    "this reduces the proof to an explicit computation for a link - homotopy representative , given in terms of the lower central series of the pure braid group . in the process of proving proposition [ s241 ]",
    ", we obtain , as above , a variant of theorem [ sth2h ] using another projection map , giving an algebraic criterion detecting link - homotopically trivial string links ; see remark [ rem : tbw2 ] and corollary [ cor : final2 ]",
    ".    it may be worth noting here that theorem [ sth2h ] can not in general be simply deduced from theorem [ sth2 ] by a mere ` link - homotopy reduction ' process .",
    "( this is simply because a string link may in general have nonzero milnor invariants of length @xmath57 , yet vanishing milnor link - homotopy invariants of length @xmath57 . )    we also emphasize that our results are not mere consequences of habegger - masbaum s work . indeed , since the kontsevich integral @xmath58 is universal among quantum invariants , we know that @xmath59 can be recovered from @xmath58 via a weight system map , so that theorems [ sth2 ] and [ sth2h ] could in principle be obtained from ( [ eq : hm ] ) simply by applying this weight system .",
    "but no explicit formula is known for this weight system map , since we do not know an explicit algebra homomorphism between @xmath60 and @xmath61 $ ] see @xcite .",
    "this is why we had to fix a @xmath23-module homomorphism in ( [ qm ] ) .",
    "actually , we expect that our result could allow to study and compute the universal @xmath0 invariant weight system , or at least , its restriction to @xmath15 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning here that the @xmath0 weight system @xmath31 is not injective , and thus we do not expect that the universal @xmath0 invariant detects milnor invariants .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath31 takes values in the invariant part of @xmath62 $ ] and a simple argument comparing the dimensions of the domain and images .",
    "we will further study properties of the universal @xmath0 weight system in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review in detail the definition of milnor numbers and of the milnor maps @xmath11 , and recall some of their properties . in section 3 ,",
    "we recall the definitions of the quantized enveloping algebra @xmath21 and the universal @xmath0 invariant , and recall how the framing and linking numbers are simply contained in the latter .",
    "section 4 provides the diagrammatic settings for our paper ; we review the definition of jacobi diagrams , and their close relationships with the material from the previous sections .",
    "this allows us to give the precise statements of our main results in section 5 .",
    "sections 6 , 7 and 8 are dedicated to the proofs .",
    "specifically , the link - homotopy version of our main result is shown in section 6 , while section 7 contains the proof of the general case .",
    "some of the key ingredients of these proofs require the theory of claspers , which we postponed to section 8 .",
