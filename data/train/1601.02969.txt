    "hookean solids are defined by their mechanical property relating linearly the stress tensor ,  @xmath0 , and the strain tensor ,  @xmath1 , @xmath2 the elasticity tensor ,  @xmath3 , belongs to one of eight material - symmetry classes shown in figure  [ fig : orderrelation ] .",
    "the backus ( 1962 ) moving average allows us to quantify the response of a wave propagating through a series of parallel layers whose thicknesses are much smaller than the wavelength .",
    "each layer is a hookean solid exhibiting a given material symmetry with given elasticity parameters .",
    "the average is a hookean solid whose elasticity parameters  and , hence , its material symmetry  allow us to model a long - wavelength response .",
    "this material symmetry of the resulting medium , to which we refer as _ equivalent _ , is a consequence of symmetries exhibited by the averaged layers .",
    "the long - wave - equivalent medium to a stack of isotropic or transversely isotropic layers with thicknesses much less than the signal wavelength was shown by backus ( 1962 ) to be a homogeneous or nearly homogeneous transversely isotropic medium , where a _ nearly _ homogeneous medium is a consequence of a _ moving _ average .",
    "backus ( 1962 ) formulation is reviewed by slawinski ( 2016 ) and bos et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , where formulations for generally anisotropic , monoclinic , and orthotropic thin layers are also derived .",
    "bos et al .  (",
    "2016 ) examine the underlying assumptions and approximations behind the backus ( 1962 ) formulation , which is derived by expressing rapidly varying stresses and strains in terms of products of algebraic combinations of rapidly varying elasticity parameters with slowly varying stresses and strains .",
    "the only mathematical approximation in the formulation is that the average of a product of a rapidly varying function and a slowly varying function is approximately equal to the product of the averages of the two functions .",
    "according to backus ( 1962 ) , the average of @xmath4 of `` width ''  @xmath5 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the weight function with the following properties : @xmath8 these properties define @xmath7 as a probability - density function with mean  @xmath9 and standard deviation  @xmath5 , explaining the use of the term `` width '' for @xmath5 .",
    "gazis et al .  (",
    "1963 ) average allows us to obtain the closest symmetric counterpart  in the frobenius sense  of a chosen material symmetry to a generally anisotropic hookean solid .",
    "the average is a hookean solid , to which we refer as _ effective _ , whose elasticity parameters correspond to the symmetry chosen _ a priori_.    gazis average is a projection given by @xmath10 where the integration is over the symmetry group , @xmath11 , whose elements are @xmath12 , with respect to the invariant measure , @xmath13 , normalized so that @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath3 , in the sense of the frobenius norm , on the linear space containing all tensors of that symmetry , which are @xmath16 .",
    "integral  ( [ eq : proj ] ) reduces to a finite sum for the classes whose symmetry groups are finite , which are all classes except isotropy and transverse isotropy .",

    "therein , elasticity tensors are not constrained to the same  or even different but known  orientation of the coordinate system .    concluding this introduction ,",
    "let us emphasize that the fundamental distinction between the two averages is their domain of operation .",
    "the gazis et al .  ( 1963 ) average is an average over symmetry groups at a point and the backus ( 1962 ) average is a spatial average over a distance .",
    "both averages can be used , separately or together , in quantitative seismology .",
    "hence , an examination of their commutativity might provide us with an insight into their physical meaning and into allowable mathematical operations .",
    "let us consider a stack of generally anisotropic layers to obtain a monoclinic medium . to examine the commutativity between the backus and gazis averages ,",
    "let us study the following diagram , @xmath17 and proposition  [ thm : one ] , below ,    [ thm : one ] in general , the backus and gazis averages do not commute .    to prove this proposition and in view of diagram  [ eq : cd2 ] ,",
    "let us begin with the following corollary .    for the generally anisotropic and monoclinic symmetries , the backus and gazis averages do not commute",

    "the other equivalent - medium elasticity parameters are zero .    following the clockwise path of diagram  [ eq : cd2 ] ,",
    "the upper branch is derived in matrix form in bos et al .",
    "then , from bos et al .",
    "( 2015 ) the result of the right - hand branch is derived by setting entries in the generally anisotropic tensor that are zero for the monoclinic tensor to zero .",
    "the nonzero entries , which are too complicated to display explicitly , are  in general  not the same as the result of the counterclockwise path .",
    "hence , for generally anisotropic and monoclinic symmetries , the backus and gazis averages do not commute .",

    "let us consider a monoclinic tensor and proceed counterclockwise along the first branch of diagram  [ eq : cd ] .",
    "using the fact that the monoclinic symmetry is a special case of general anisotropy , we invoke corollary  [ col : ortho ] to conclude that @xmath38 , which is equivalent to setting @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 to zero in the monoclinic tensor .",
    "we perform the upper branch of diagram  [ eq : cd ] , which is the averaging of a stack of monoclinic layers to get a monoclinic equivalent medium , as in the case of the lower branch of diagram  [ eq : cd2 ] . thus ,",

    "the results of the clockwise and counterclockwise paths are the same if @xmath46 , which is a special case of monoclinic symmetry .",
    "thus , the backus average and gazis average commute for that case , but not in general .      in a manner analogous to diagram  [ eq : cd ] , but proceeding from the the upper - left - hand corner orthotropic tensor to lower - right - hand corner tetragonal tensor by the counterclockwise path , @xmath47 we obtain @xmath48 following the clockwise path",

    "thus , the backus average and gazis average do commute for @xmath50 and @xmath54 , which is a special case of orthotropic symmetry , but not in general .",
    "let us also consider the case of monoclinic layers and a tetragonal medium to examine the process of combining the gazis averages , which is tantamount to combining diagrams  ( [ eq : cd ] ) and  ( [ eq : cd3 ] ) , @xmath55 in accordance with proposition  [ thm : one ] , there is  in general  no commutativity .",
    "however , the outcomes are the same as for the corresponding steps in sections  [ sec : mono ] and [ sec : ortho ] . in general , for the gazis average , proceeding directly , @xmath56 , is tantamount to proceeding along arrows in figure  [ fig : orderrelation ] , @xmath57 .",
    "no such combining of the backus averages is possible , since , for each step , layers become a homogeneous medium .",
    "lack of commutativity can also be exemplified by the case of transversely isotropic layers .",
    "following the clockwise path of diagram  [ eq : cd ] , the backus average results in a transversely isotropic medium , whose gazis average  in accordance with figure  [ fig : orderrelation]is isotropic . following the counterclockwise path ,",
    "gazis average results in an isotropic medium , whose backus average , however , is transverse isotropy .",
    "thus , not only the elasticity parameters , but even the resulting material - symmetry classes differ .    also , we could  in a manner analogous to the one illustrated in diagram  [ eq : cd4]begin with generally anisotropic layers and obtain isotropy by the clockwise path and transverse isotropy by the counterclockwise path , which again illustrates noncommutativity .",
    "herein , we assume that all tensors are expressed in the same orientation of their coordinate systems . otherwise , the process of averaging become more complicated , as discussed  for the gazis average  by kochetov and slawinski ( 2009a , 2009b ) and as mentioned  for the backus average  by bos et al .",

    "we do not see a physical justification for special cases in which  given the same orientation of coordinate systems  these averages commute .",
