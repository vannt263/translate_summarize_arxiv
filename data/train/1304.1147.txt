    "mass as the total energy of the system can be used to calculate the heat capacity and a full consistent description of stability conditions and also the mechanism of phase transition from stable to unstable cases in the presence of the charges @xcite .",

    "this radiation evaporates the surface of black hole with a thermal spectrum exactly the same as the planck black body prediction .",
    "the key object here is to label surface gravity by temperature .",
    "but if this black hole is located in a de - sitter or anti - de sitter background , it means that it was a black hole in cosmology , then it can be shown that both evaporation and anti evaporation can happen if the black hole is slightly perturbed from the background .",
    "the essence of evaporation or anti evaporation depends on how the radius of horizon evolves during the perturbation . in einstein gravity",
    "it is a well known result and it has been proved by analytical method in s - wave approximation of a single mode perturbation @xcite and numerically by including higher modes .    in modified gravity ( see for a review @xcite-@xcite )",
    ", it seems that for some kinds of @xmath11 gravity models as the very popular modification of einstein gravity , such anti evaporation happens @xcite .",
    "the first step is how to model the spacetime of schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) in a limiting case in which the final state is a black hole with one horizon ( degenerated ) and in thermal equilibrium to use the equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the solution of einstein equation in the limiting case of sds is proposed by nariai @xcite .",
    "this solution which we propose to investigate in details in next sections , is a vacuum inhomogeneous solution of einstein field equations in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "it has different representations in static and non static patches .",
    "so , the perturbation on this spacetime can be done in two patches .    as an alternative to einstein gravity and in spite of @xmath11 gravity , a generalized theory ( gauge theory )",

    "it means the black hole never evaporates or anti - evaporates .",
    "it implies that the final stage of the black hole using diagonal tetrads basis in this formation process is the same as the initial radius and this result does not dependent on the form of the @xmath12 model .",
    "it indicates the absence of the evaporation in @xmath12 scenario of gravity if we apply the formalism to the diagonal teterds . to conclude the more general statement which be independence of the form of tetrads , and because the form of the theory here is not lorentz invariant we need to perform the analysis with non - diagonal tetrads . in this case",

    "so , in spite of the diagonal analysis , in the non - diagonal formalism we can have both evaporation and anti - evaporation .",

    "this kind of work in order to find good tetrads ( the non - diagonal ones ) has been performed in @xcite , but within friedmann - robertson - walker universe , showing the importance of using such tetrads .",
    "in brief , we investigated the existence of evaporation in the @xmath12 gravity using two different kinds of tetrad , the usual diagonal and also the non - diagonal one . by starting from a diagonal tetrads , in spite of the einstein gravity and another modified gravities based on curvature , when you are working in a weitzenbock spacetime , with torsion , we explicitly showed that ( anti)evaporation never happen .",
    "the absence of evaporation is an universal property of @xmath12 gravity and it is independent from the generic form of @xmath12 models .",

    "this result implies that a typical black hole in any generic form of generalized teleparallel gravity is frozen in it s initial state if we use the diagonal tetrads .",
    "but the story is completely different if we use the non - diagonal tetrads . with the non - diagonal tetrads",
    ", we have both the ( anti)evaporation dependence on the parameters of the @xmath12 model and also the initial horizon perturbation phase .",
    "moreover , our results show the importance of using non - diagonal tetrads where we note that eqs .",

    "all this interesting result comes from the fact that in this paper we have made a good choice of the non - diagonal tetrad .",

    "<S> we formulate evaporation phenomena in a generic model of generalized teleparallel gravity in weitzenbock spacetime with diagonal and non - diagonal tetrads basis . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform the perturbation analysis around the constant torsion scalar solution named nariai spacetime which is an exact solution of field equations as the limiting case of the schwarzschild - de sitter and in the limit where two back hole and their cosmological horizons coincide . by a carefully analysis of the horizon perturbation equation </S>",
    "<S> , we show that ( anti)evaporation can not happen if we use a diagonal tetrad basis . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that a typical black hole in any generic form of generalized teleparallel gravity is frozen in its initial state if we use the diagonal tetrads . </S>",
    "<S> but in the case of non - diagonal tetrads the analysis is completely different . by a suitable non trivial non - diagonal tetrad basis </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the linear stability of the model under perturbations of the metric and torsion simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that in spite of the diagonal case , both evaporation and anti evaporation can happen . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomena depend on the initial phase of the horizon perturbation . in the first mode when we restrict ourselves to the first lower modes the ( anti)evaporation happens . </S>",
    "<S> so , in non - diagonal case the physical phenomena is reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important advantage of using non - diagonal tetrads instead of the diagonal ones . </S>",
