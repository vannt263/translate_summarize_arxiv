    "we assume that @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and we denote this asymptotic regime as `` @xmath20 '' .",
    "we also assume that the spectral measures of @xmath18 and @xmath19 converge respectively towards the probability measures @xmath22 and @xmath23 as @xmath20 .",

    "we also provide a complete characterization of this support along with a thorough analysis of the master equations relating @xmath11 to @xmath22 and @xmath29 . to that end , we follow the general ideas already provided in the classical paper of marchenko and pastur @xcite and further developed in @xcite and @xcite . + in @xcite , silverstein and choi performed this study in the so called sample covariance matrix case where @xmath30 .",
    "the outline of the present article closely follows that of @xcite although at multiple occasions our proofs depart from those of @xcite , making the article more self - contained . in particular ,",
    "while silverstein and choi benefited from the existence of an explicit expression for the inverse of the stieltjes transform of @xmath11 when @xmath30 , this is no longer the case in the general setting requiring the use of more fundamental analytical tools . in the setting of @xcite",
    ", it has been further shown in @xcite that under some conditions , no closed interval outside the support of @xmath11 contains an eigenvalue of @xmath31 , with probability one , for all large @xmath8 . in @xcite , a finer result on the so called `` exact separation '' of the eigenvalues of @xmath31 between the connected components of the support of @xmath11",
    "recently , it has been discovered that the characterization in @xcite of the support of @xmath11 and the results on the master equations relating @xmath11 to @xmath22 , beside their own interest , lead in conjunction with the results of @xcite to the design of consistent statistical estimators of some linear functionals of the eigenvalues of @xmath18 or projectors on the eigenspaces of this matrix .",
    "such estimators have been developed by mestre in @xcite , the initial idea dating back to the work of girko ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "+ in @xcite , brent dozier and silverstein studied the properties of the limit spectral measure of the so called `` information plus noise '' ensemble . a first result on the absence of eigenvalues outside the support of the limit spectral measure has been established in @xcite . in @xcite other separation results as well as statistical estimation algorithms along the lines of @xcite were proposed .",
    "+ turning to the separable covariance matrix ensemble of interest here , the absence of eigenvalues outside the support of @xmath11 has been established by paul and silverstein in @xcite without characterizing this support .",
    "the results of this paper therefore complement those of @xcite .",
    "more importantly , similar to the case @xmath32 , these results are a necessary first step to devise statistical estimation algorithms of _ e.g. _ linear functionals of the eigenvalues of one of the matrices @xmath18 or @xmath19 . work on this subject is currently in progress .",
    "+ finally , it has been noticed in the large random matrix community that there is an intimate connection between the square root behavior of the density of the limit spectral measure at the edges of the support and the tracy - widom fluctuations of the eigenvalues near those edges ( see @xcite dealing with the sample covariance matrix case ) .",
    "it can be conjectured that such behaviour still holds ( with some assumptions on the probability law of the elements of @xmath16 ) in the separable covariance case considered here . in this",
    "regard , theorem [ sq - root ] may help guessing the exact form of the tracy - widom law at the edges of the support of @xmath11 .",
