    "evolved high - redshift galaxies hold the key to addressing two fundamental issues in observational cosmology : first , when did the bulk of star formation and mass assembly occur ?",
    "second , how does the space density of galaxies evolve with time ? because different galaxy formation scenarios have distinct predictions for the space densities and masses of galaxies at redshifts beyond one , comparisons of statistical properties of evolved high - redshift galaxies and local ellipticals may provide a direct means of discriminating between competing galaxy formation scenarios ( @xcite ) .",
    "previous studies of evolved galaxies have yielded inconsistent measurements of their space density ( see @xcite for a list of references ) due to a strong field - to - field variation in the surface density ( @xcite ) and various selection biases ( @xcite ) . evolved galaxies may be characterized by their intrinsically red colors due to the lack of ongoing star formation that provides most of the uv light in typical galaxy spectral energy distributions , but confusions may arise because of the presence of dusty star - forming galaxies that exhibit similar colors .",
    "we have been conducting the las campanas infrared ( lcir ) survey in the past two years .",
    "it is a deep near - infrared and optical imaging survey of distant galaxies over one square degree of sky at high galactic latitudes ( @xcite ) .",
    "this program utilizes one of the largest near - infrared cameras available ( cirsi;@xcite ) that produces an image of @xmath3 contiguous field of view in a sequence of four pointings .",
    "the survey is designed to identify a large number of red galaxies at @xmath4 using photometric redshift techniques .",
    "the primary objectives of the program are ( 1 ) to examine the nature of the red galaxy population and identify evolved galaxies at @xmath4 , ( 2 ) to study the space density and luminosity evolution of evolved galaxies at @xmath5 , and ( 3 ) to measure the spatial clustering of evolved high - redshift galaxies ( @xcite ) , thereby inferring merging rates of these galaxies for constraining theoretical models . here",
    "we summarize the survey design and present initial results from comparing optical and near - infrared colors , number density and luminosity evolution between galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "we have completed an @xmath1-band imaging survey in six distinct high galactic latitude fields , covering 1.1 square degrees of sky , to a mean @xmath6 detection limit in a four arcsecond diameter aperture of @xmath7 .",
    "we have also obtained complementary optical images of these fields to consistent depths required to identify red galaxies with @xmath8 or @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "details of the @xmath1-band survey status and sample photometric catalogs are presented in @xcite .",
    "the current survey depths allow us to identify evolved galaxies that are more than one magnitude fainter than an @xmath10 elliptical galaxy at @xmath11 .",
    "we have initiated a @xmath12-band imaging survey of the six fields using a re - imaging camera developed by persson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that provides an effective cold stop , extending the operational range of cirsi to the @xmath12 band .",
    "the primary goal of the @xmath12-band survey is to extend the redshift range probed by the @xmath1-band survey , in order for us to identify sub-@xmath13 galaxies at @xmath14 .",
    "we have observed @xmath15 320 square arcminutes of sky to a mean @xmath6 detection limit in a four arcsecond diameter aperture of @xmath16 .",
    "more than 3,300 galaxies are identified in the @xmath12-band survey so far , of which @xmath17 have @xmath18 .",
    "over the past several years , it has been demonstrated that distant galaxies may be accurately and reliably identified using photometric redshift techniques that incorporate optical and near - infrared broad - band photometry ( @xcite ) . for galaxies lacking strong emission or absorption features , we are still able to estimate redshifts based on the presence / absence of spectral discontinuities in broad - band optical and near - infrared colors . to identify distant red galaxies , we have adopted the photometric redshift technique developed originally by lanzetta and collaborators ( @xcite ) , and modified the program to account for the large number of stars that appear in wide - field surveys by including a suite of stellar templates  from early - type ob stars to late - type l and t dwarfs .",
    "comparison of photometric redshifts @xmath19 and spectroscopic redshifts @xmath20 at redshifts @xmath21 for 67 objects with spectroscopic redshifts in the hubble deep field south ( hdfs ) shows that the photometric redshifts are both accurate and reliable , with an rms dispersion between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath22 ( figure 1a ) .",
    "the accuracy and reliability of photometric redshift measurements allow us to study the galaxy two - point correlation function and the galaxy luminosity function as a function of redshift at @xmath23 using the wide - field survey data .",
    "the lower precision of photometric redshift measurements may be compensated by the large sample size .",
    "we show in figure 1b the redshift histogram of the @xmath1-band detected galaxies and of those with @xmath24 identified in the hdfs region .",
    "the curves indicate the predicted redshift distribution of the total and red populations based on the model that best fits the differential surface density measurements as described below in   4.1 .",
    "the @xmath25 color criterion is determined based on predictions of various evolution scenarios to select evolved galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "it is analogous to a color selection of @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1b shows that more than 6% of the @xmath1-band detected galaxies have @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "we present the @xmath26 vs. @xmath27 color ",
    "color distribution of the @xmath1-band detected objects in figure 2a and the @xmath26 vs. @xmath28 color  color distribution of the @xmath12-band detected objects in figure 2b , along with predictions based on different star formation histories .",
    "different symbols represent objects at different redshifts according to the results of our photometric redshift analysis .",
    "the general agreement between distributions of various model predictions and measurements of galaxies in our catalog , and the clear separation of the stellar sequence ( which is most obvious in the @xmath26 vs. @xmath28 plot ) suggest that most stars have been accurately identified in our survey fields .",
    "the large scatter in the @xmath26 colors ( corresponding to the rest - frame uv colors at @xmath0 ) spanned by the galaxies of red @xmath27 or @xmath28 colors reveals a wide range of star formation histories for which our simple models provide only an idealized description . in particular , the large scatter in the @xmath26 colors for galaxies of @xmath25 or @xmath29 ( indicative of redshifts",
    "@xmath0 ) suggest a significant amount of ongoing star formation in these galaxies .",
    "in addition , the small fraction of galaxies with @xmath25 and @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 and @xmath30 ) suggests that there are few objects that may be adequately characterized as pure passively evolving systems formed at high redshifts .",
    "figure 3a shows the number - magnitude relation of the @xmath1-band detected galaxies ( open squares ) and the @xmath1-band detected red galaxies ( closed points ) along with model predictions ( curves ) and previous measurements ( open points ) .",
    "the number - magnitude relation of the @xmath1-band detected galaxies may be described using a local @xmath32-band luminosity function ( @xcite ) with pure luminosity evolution expected from a 1 gyr exponentially declining star formation rate model . to model the number - magnitude relation of the red population ,",
    "we scale the luminosity function according to the population ratio of elliptical galaxies observed in the local universe and identify red galaxies as those brighter than @xmath33 with a faint - end slope @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and a space density @xmath36 .",
    "we also consider a number density evolution characterized by @xmath37 with @xmath38 , 0.5 , and 1.0 ( solid curves from top to bottom ) .",
    "our measurements are consistent with previous surface density measurements both for the total and the red populations .",
    "figure 3a shows that a luminosity evolution model with a mild space density evolution may explain the faint number counts .",
    "the much steeper bright - end slope of the number - magnitude relation of the red galaxies indicates that most of the foreground ( @xmath39 ) galaxies have been effectively excluded from the red population and that the slope reflects the shape of the bright - end luminosity function of the red population .",
    "in addition , we find that red galaxies with @xmath9 constitute @xmath15 20% of the @xmath1-band detected galaxies at @xmath40 , but only @xmath15 2% at @xmath41 . a strong field - to - field variation in the surface density of the red population is directly observed in our survey , which is expected according to the results of angular clustering analysis of these red galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate a mean surface density of @xmath42 arcmin@xmath43 with an rms dispersion of @xmath44 arcmin@xmath43 for red galaxies brighter than @xmath45 .",
    "finally , the consistent slopes between the red subsamples suggest similar underlying luminosity functions .",
    "various deep redshift surveys have yielded consistent measurements of the luminosity function for galaxies at @xmath46 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , but it becomes exceedingly difficult beyond this redshift range both because galaxies become even fainter and because bright sky lines make accurate spectroscopic redshift identifications challenging . despite a lower precision , the large number of distant galaxies expected from a wide - field multi - color survey allow us to obtain statistically significant estimates of various galaxy properties using photometric redshift measurements . here",
    "we present the first measurements of the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath47 based on photometric redshifts .",
    "figure 3b shows the rest - frame @xmath48-band luminosity functions of the total @xmath1-band selected sample and galaxies with @xmath25 in two of our survey fields . at @xmath2 ,",
    "the observed - frame @xmath1-band roughly corresponds to the rest - frame @xmath48-band , therefore the calculation does not rely heavily on the adopted templates to determine the @xmath49-correction .",
    "we calculate the luminosity function in each magnitude bin using the @xmath50 method , where @xmath51 is estimated as the comoving volume accessible by a galaxy in the sample based on its absolute magnitude .",
    "errors are calculated using a bootstrap method , including sampling errors and measurement uncertainties in photometric redshift , galaxy photometry , and colors .",
    "comparison of the luminosity functions of the total and red populations shows that red galaxies dominate the bright galaxy population at @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , the space densities of the two populations are statistically identical at the bright end . the space densities of red galaxy and galaxies with bluer @xmath27 colors become comparable at around @xmath52 .",
    "finally , our @xmath1-band survey is insensitive to sub-@xmath10 galaxies , and so we can not constrain the faint - end slope of the luminosity function .    to assess luminosity function evolution , we compare our measurements with those presented in @xcite . the solid curve in figure 3b shows a scaled cnoc2 luminosity function of color selected early - type galaxies at @xmath53 .",
    "first , we estimate a luminosity evolution using the same 1-gyr exponentially declining star formation model and find that @xmath54 .",
    "next , we find that a scaling factor in the space density @xmath55 is necessary to match the curve with our measurements , consistent with the results of the number - magnitude analysis .",
    "however , the degree to which the cnoc2 and lcirs samples probe the same galaxy population remains uncertain . in summary ,",
    "the results of number count studies and luminosity function measurements indicate that most early - type galaxies were already in place by @xmath2 with a modest space density evolution and a mild luminosity evolution over that expected from passive evolution .",
