    "the recently realized trapping of sodium atoms by purely optical means @xcite opens up the possibility of studying `` spinor '' condensates in which the spin degrees of freedom are not frozen @xcite .",

    "these studies predicted a variety of new phenomena such as the existence of spin domains in the ground state @xcite and the propagation of spin waves @xcite .",
    "the mean - field dynamics inherent in these works is known to be equivalent to a classical dynamics whose degrees of freedom are the phase and population of the three hyperfine levels @xcite .    in this paper we show that this classical dynamics is integrable as a consequence of number conservation and axial symmetry in spin space . by a proper canonical transformation it reduces to a dynamics involving only one degree of freedom .",
    "the determination of the equilibrium points reveals a rich structure in phase - space .",
    "contour plots of the constant energy surfaces show that the population is a periodic function of time , where the periodic motion can be a libration or a rotation .",
    "our studies differs from references @xcite by taking explicitly into account the constraint of the axial symmetry in spin space .",
    "this allow us to make a detailed discussion of the properties of the equilibrium configurations and of the population and phase dynamics of the spinor condensate , which complements previous works @xcite .",

    "one is that the mean - value of the total number of particles and of the component of the total spin of the condensate in the direction of the magnetic field are constants of the motion , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the other is that the dynamics involves only one degree of freedom    @xmath33    to simplify the equations of motion ( [ equation15 ] ) we define new variables which are the old variables divided by the number of particles , @xmath34 , to write the equations of motion as    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the density of the condensate .",
