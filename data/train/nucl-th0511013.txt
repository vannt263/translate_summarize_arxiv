    "in recent nuclear structure calculations , the reliability of various predictions associated with phenomena of several prominent electroweak processes ( @xmath1-decay modes , lepton - capture by nuclei , neutrino - nucleus reactions , etc . ) relies upon the accurate description of the nuclear many - body wave functions @xcite . among the nuclear structure aspects which can quite strongly influence such predictions , the consideration of the deformation @xcite and the nucleon - nucleon correlations effects @xcite ( wherever they might be appreciable ) is of significant importance . as it is well known , the ground state nucleon - nucleon correlations @xcite are of particular significance to be reliably incorporated especially when investigating processes for which the branching ratios or decay ( event ) rates are highly suppressed and , therefore , the corresponding transition matrix elements are very sensitive @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the nuclear deformation , e.g. for axially symmetric nuclear systems , should necessarily be considered by applying appropriate treatments and using reliable methods @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to address the effects of deformation and pairing correlations on a few nuclear observables of the ground state for moderately deformed s - d shell nuclei in the spirit of approaches based on bcs quasi - particles .",
    "the properties of main interest are the ground state charge form factor @xmath2 @xcite , as well as the occupancy ( vacancy ) numbers of several orbitals around the fermi level @xcite .",
    "such quantities ( also those referred to low - lying excitations like transition densities , transition form factors , etc . ) constitute very common tests in nuclear structure theory for the many - body model wave functions @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the above properties are known with very high accuracy ( @xmath3 ) , e.g. from experiments of elastic scattering of electrons , protons , etc . off target",
    "nuclei @xcite . on the theoretical side , average potentials ( spherical woods - saxon or harmonic oscillator , etc . ) employed in bcs theories and nucleon orbitals , both of which are directly related to gross nuclear features of the ground states , have been quite effective in describing the dynamics of many mainly spherical nuclei @xcite . however , even though the direct calculation of the charge form factor ( and other gross nuclear properties ) through a nuclear model ground state ( g.s . )",
    "wave function is a very extensively discussed issue , the reproducibility of the scattering data in the high momentum transfer region ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) with the experimental accuracy has not yet been achieved ( in the context of any nuclear model ) for most of the nuclear systems .",
    "the existence of nuclear deformation , in general , is closely related to the non - spherical components of the proton ( neutron ) density distribution and the corresponding proton ( neutron ) nuclear form factor whereas the nucleon - nucleon correlations are , to a large extent , related to the nuclear surface texture , the main characteristics of which are the occupation probabilities of the active orbits .",
    "these quantities are studied in single - nucleon transfer reactions @xcite , but often the results differ substantially from the predictions of independent particle approximations and other methods , due to the fact that , in many of these models , the correlations and deformation phenomena are not ( or may not correctly @xcite ) taken into account @xcite .",
    "hence , details of the nuclear surface and also bulk phenomena for many nuclei may have not correctly been understood in terms of many existing models .",
    "the present method employs a bcs ground state built out of a deformed ws basis wave functions .",
    "the required two - body interaction is taken to have a schematic - type , the monopole part of which is scaled phenomenologically ( separately for protons and neutrons ) so as to be consistent with the observed proton and neutron separation energies within the bcs procedure @xcite . at first , we study the nuclear form factors for the set of deformed nuclei @xmath6 mg , @xmath7 mg , @xmath8si and @xmath9s ( s - d shell nuclei ) , by considering them as systems having axially symmetric @xmath1 ( quadrupole ) deformation only @xcite .",
    "they are rather well deformed isotopes with the following values of the parameter @xmath1 : @xmath10mg@xmath11 @xcite ( 0.374 @xcite ) , @xmath12mg@xmath13 @xcite ( -0.310 @xcite ) , @xmath14si@xmath15 @xcite ( -0.478 @xcite ) and @xmath16s@xmath17 @xcite ( 0.000 @xcite ) . in the present work",
    "we apply also values of the deformation parameter @xmath1 which originated from experimental values of the quadrupole moment , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite    we next proceed with the study of the effects of deformation and pairing interactions on the surface features of these nuclei , namely , on the smearing of their fermi surface which is very sensitive to the orbit occupancies of the active space . in our method ,",
    "deformation effects and pairing correlations for proton - proton and neutron - neutron interactions may simultaneously and in a quite reliable manner be considered which is in accord with the experimental indications of ref .",
    "@xcite showing that these effects must be treated as much as possible on equal footing . finally , for the sake of comparison with the results of other similar methods , we study the same properties for the above isotopes , but now by expanding the required deformed woods - saxon wave functions into a deformed harmonic oscillator ( dho ) basis .",
    "we remark that , spherical ws potentials parameterized for the well depth , skin thickness , radius and spin - orbit constants , etc . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , have been used by us in the past for microscopic random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations of decay ( event ) rates in electroweak processes ( @xmath18-decay @xcite , flavor violating processes @xcite , etc . ) for various nuclei .",
    "several of these calculations must be extended to non - spherical systems or must be corrected to include deformation and/or correlations effects .",
    "the present method offers some advantages for such purposes @xcite .    in the remainder of the paper , we first describe the main ingredients of our method ( sect .",
    "2 ) , then we present the results obtained and compare them with existing experimental data ( sect .",
    "3 ) , and finally ( sect .",
    "4 ) we summarize the main conclusions extracted .",
    "for the description of axially symmetric nuclear systems , where the cylindrical coordinates @xmath19 are appropriate , a deformed harmonic oscillator ( dho ) potential has been primarily used @xcite .",
    "the eigenfunctions of this unharmonic oscillator are described in terms of two frequencies : @xmath20 , in the direction of the z - axis , and @xmath21 , for the motion perpendicular to the symmetry z - axis .",
    "then , the space - spin dho single particle wave functions are written as @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the projections on the z - axis of the spin and orbital angular momentum , respectively .",
    "@xmath25 stands for the spin wave function and the components of the spatial parts are defined as follows :    \\(i ) the radial part is usually written in terms of a dimensionless coordinate @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the nucleon mass ) as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a normalization factor and @xmath31 are the associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "\\(ii ) the z - dependent part is similarly written in terms of a dimensionless variable @xmath32 @xmath33 as @xmath34 where again @xmath35 is a normalization factor and @xmath36 are the hermite polynomials .",
    "\\(iii ) the @xmath37-dependent part is given by @xmath38 which is normalized to unity .",
    "the coordinate scaling parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which have dimensions of inverse length , characterize the motion in the perpendicular and z - direction , respectively .",
    "obviously , the level of anisotropy of the field is represented by the difference between the two frequencies , @xmath21 and @xmath20 , which are written in terms of the usual quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath1 as @xcite @xmath41",
    "where @xmath42 is weakly dependent on @xmath1 ( enough to conserve the nuclear volume ) . from the latter two equations we obtain @xmath43 the parameter @xmath1",
    "is defined so that @xmath44 correspond to the so - called prolate shapes and @xmath45 correspond to oblate shapes .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian involving an axially symmetric woods - saxon potential have a good quantum number @xmath46 , the projection of the total angular momentum , @xmath47 , on the symmetry z - axis , i.e. @xmath48 ( due to the assumed symmetry they are eigenfunctions of the @xmath49 operator ) .",
    "these eigenfunctions can be expanded into basis functions like those of eq .",
    "( [ dho - wf ] ) , namely , into the eigenfunctions of a deformed harmonic oscillator potential . in the intermediate region of the parameter @xmath1",
    "we are interested in , @xmath50 , one could employ either eq .",
    "( [ dho - wf ] ) or total angular momentum coupled bases like the @xmath51 ( see ref .",

    "in this case the expansion of the ws basis takes the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are expansion coefficients obtained from the diagonalization procedure .",

    "the ground state of even - even deformed nuclei is determined by the deformed pairing hamiltonian , which includes monopole proton - proton and neutron - neutron pairing interactions as @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the un - renormalized single particle energies for protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "@xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is the proton ( neutron ) fermi energy and the operator @xmath74 creates pairs in time reversed orbits written as @xmath75 here , @xmath76 and @xmath77 stand for the creation and annihilation operators of a particle ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote proton and neutron , respectively ) in the axially symmetric woods - saxon potential .",
    "@xmath80 is the sign of the angular momentum projection @xmath46 , namely , @xmath81 .",
    "we note that the intrinsic states are twofold degenerate , since the states with @xmath46 and @xmath82 have the same energy as a consequence of the time reversal invariance ( the symbol @xmath83 indicates time reversed states ) .",
    "the pairing interaction strengths @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which characterize the associated monopole interaction for proton or neutron pairs , respectively , are determined by fitting the theoretical pairing gaps to the average empirical ones parameterized as , @xmath86 mev @xcite , where @xmath87 represent the mass number of the isotope in question .",
    "the first part of the present calculations refers to the proton form factors of the deformed nuclei @xmath6 mg , @xmath7 mg , @xmath8si and @xmath9s carried out as follows . at first , in the spirit of the independent particle approximation ( slater determinant calculations ) , we used a deformed woods - saxon field parameterized as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in this step there is no correlations effect ) . in the second step ,",
    "the pairing correlations are inserted in our calculation by means of the bcs theory , namely through the monopole pairing interaction , a schematic type nucleon - nucleon force .",

    "for comparison , we evaluated the same proton form factors utilizing now a deformed harmonic oscillator basis in the bcs ground state , as discussed in sect .",
    ", the latter results include correlations of the same kind as those of the second step .",
    "for all the cases studied , we adjusted the parameter @xmath40 of eq .",
    "( [ rz - par ] ) so as , for each isotope , the first diffraction minimum of the nuclear form factor to appear at the experimental position ( value of the momentum transfer @xmath88 ) . for the deformation parameter @xmath1 , throughout this part of work we used the more recent calculations of ref .",

    "the results labeled ws+bcs ( solid line ) include pairing correlations and deformation effects while those labeled ws ( dashed line ) originate from a simple slater determinant constructed out of a deformed woods - saxon basis wave functions .",
    "the dashed dotted curve , dho+bcs , comes from a deformed harmonic oscillator field employed in the bcs ground state.,width=510,height=510 ]    the results obtained as described above , are presented in fig .",
    "1 , where we use the notation ws to denote the deformed ( axially symmetric ) woods - saxon results , the notation ws+bcs to represent the results containing in addition pairing correlations , and the notation dho+bcs for the results which consider the deformation and pairing - correlations effects through the harmonic oscillator model . the main conclusions stemming out of the above calculations are the following . as can be seen from fig .",
    "1 , the incorporation of pairing correlations ( second step ) via the bcs procedure , affects appreciably the shape of the charge form factors ( compare the plots corresponding to ws and ws+bcs results ) , especially for @xmath89 @xmath5 , which is a well known outcome .",
    "furthermore , the simultaneous consideration of deformation and pairing correlations in the bcs ground state with woods - saxon potential , reproduces the experimental form factor data ( and charge density distribution ) much better than the deformed harmonic oscillator model ( compare results labeled ws+bcs and dho+bcs ) . as it is evident from fig .",
    "1 , nearly all the diffraction minima of the results labeled ws+bcs are produced quite close to their experimental momentum transfer locations ( also some additional minima not observed by experiments up to now are predicted for values of @xmath90 @xmath5 ) @xcite . for high momentum transfer ( close to the nuclear center of the charge density distribution )",
    "the reproducibility becomes worse due to the presence of other sorts of correlations not included in our results ( short range nucleon - nucleon correlations , etc . ) and other kinds of effects ( meson - exchange corrections , etc . ) .",
    "we investigate also the effect of the deformation on charge form factors as well the occupancy numbers by using various values of the deformation parameter @xmath1 which originated from ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "more specifically the parameter @xmath91 calculated through the relation @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the intrinsic quadrupole moment ( in barn ) , @xmath94 is the charge radius ( in fm ) and @xmath95 the number of the proton .",
    "@xmath93 calculated from the experimental quadrupole moment @xmath96 via the relation @xmath97 the relative values are exhibited in table 1 .",
    "2 focuses on the nucleus @xmath98 mg and @xmath99s showing the calculated nuclear form factors for various values of the deformation parameter @xmath1 where taken for table 1 .",
    "we see that , the shape of the form factor is sensitive to changes of the quadrupole deformation .",
    "it is worth noting that , in general , the values of the parameter @xmath1 affect twofold the form factor results .",
    "first , they define the set of the single particle ws wave functions for eq .",
    "( [ ff-2 ] ) and energies @xmath70 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and , second , through the single - particle energies @xmath70 and the subsequently given pairing strengths , they determine the values of the orbit occupancies @xmath59 entering eq .",
    "( [ ff-2 ] ) .",
    ".the experimental values of the quadrupole moment @xmath96 and the corresponding values of the deformation parameter @xmath1 taken from ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the disagreement between these experimental data and our theory might be related to the factors discussed below , after making the following remarks : in our bcs treatment all orbits involved in our rich model space are considered as active , whereas the shell model results of ref .",
    "@xcite originate from the very restricted model space @xmath100@xmath101@xmath102 ( both interactions used in @xcite give rather similar orbit occupancies even though they differ in their predictions of occupancy dependent single particle energies , which means that for each isotope , the corresponding to our fig .",
    "3 pictures given by the latter two shell model calculations might be substantially different compared to each other ) .",
    "the parameterization of the deformed ws potential assumed in this paper , had originally been proposed for spherical nuclei ( ranging from @xmath103o to @xmath104pb ) .",
    "the confidence level of this parameterization ( and subsequently of our results for deformed nuclei ) relies upon its isospin - dependence characteristic which has indirectly been checked from the reliability of descriptions done ( under the same assumptions with the present work ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to elucidate further the relationship between the deformation parameter @xmath1 and the depletion of the valence shells , we have carried out a set of calculations with different values of @xmath1 ( originated from ref .",
    "@xcite , see also table 1 ) keeping fixed the pairing gap for the proton - proton and neutron - neutron channel , @xmath105 , in the bcs procedure ( restricting in this way as much as possible the variation of pairing correlations effects ) .",
    "we have chosen the nuclei @xmath98 mg and @xmath99s and the results are displayed in fig .",
    "it is evident from this figure , that the fermi sea depletion decreseased slightly as the deformation effects tend to be canceled out and vice versa .",
    "more precisely the depletion ranging in the case of @xmath98 mg from @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) to @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) and in case of @xmath99s ranging from @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) to @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "this is an interesting result and may be accounted for as follows . by keeping the pairing interaction rather constant , a decrease of the deformation increases the orbit vacancies @xmath114 and subsequently causes more effective participation of the nuclear core to the surface texture .",
    "moreover , since for the latter results ( and those of table 2 ) we have not considered other sorts of correlations except pairing ones , the smearing of the fermi surface is artificially interpreted by increasing the vacancies of the hole states ( nuclear core ) , namely the fermi surface depletion . in the region of deformation parameter , @xmath115 , where our method is applicable",
    ", the fermi sea depletion seems , for this reason , to be overestimated . at this point",
    "we should mention that , in the recent literature @xcite authors assert that the depopulation of states below the fermi energy is much more pronounced than it was believed in the past , since the quantitative information we have today from both theory and experiment support occupation probabilities in finite nuclei of the order of 75 % only . our present results underly this result and it is expected from future measurements on specific nuclei with higher precision and covering larger range of momentum transfer to shed more light on the situation .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=321,height=321 ]    before closing we note that , in our calculations , effects like finite proton size , center - of - mass corrections , etc . , have not been taken into account . instead , we restricted ourselves to the evaluation of the point nucleons ( protons ) distribution , which is equivalent to ignoring their internal substructure .",
    "this approximation has extensively been used in nuclear structure methods based on bcs ground state , because , the shape of the charge form factor is mainly determined by the shape of the point - proton density . in the present work we have also stayed within the assumptions of the above approximation encouraged for it by the rather well description of decay processes like the double beta decay @xcite performed recently by using wave functions constructed as described in sect .",
    "as it is well known , the nuclear structure details affect considerably the corresponding double beta decay rates since its transition matrix elements are fairly sensitive .",
    "in the present paper , at first , we formulated on the basis of bcs quasi - particles a simultaneous consideration of deformation and pairing correlations phenomena .",
    "the mean field description is provided in terms of an axially symmetric woods - saxon potential whereas for the two - body interaction we assumed schematic forces .",
    "next , we tested this method by studying gross ground state properties like the nuclear form factor , the occupancy ( vacancy ) numbers of the active orbitals , and the corresponding depletion of the fermi sea for the set of deformed nuclei , @xmath6 mg , @xmath7 mg , @xmath8si and @xmath9s . as it is well known from nuclear structure calculations , the focus on such primary gross properties , which is by itself a continuously important subject of study , provides very good tests for microscopic descriptions of the nuclear dynamics within many - body theories .",
    "this is encouraged by the great resource of data for these properties provided mainly by electron scattering experiments .    from the conclusions extracted out of the present calculations",
    ", we see that the use of deformed woods - saxon field in our bcs approach reproduces quite well the experimental form factor data in the set of isotopes studied , considerably better than the description offered when utilizing a deformed harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the simultaneous consideration of the deformation and pairing correlations affect largely the fermi sea depletion and produces appreciable smearing of the nuclear surface .",
    "the investigation of the influence of the quadrupole deformation ( parameter @xmath1 ) on the surface textures of the above moderately deformed nuclear systems , showed that the active orbit occupancies and , subsequently , the depletion of the fermi sea for each isotope , are dependent slightly upon the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the results found for the fermi sea depletion are more than 40% ( depending on the specific nuclear system ) larger than those emerging out of the old experimental data , from which one would infer that our method overestimates , somehow , the fermi sea depletion through stronger deformation effects in order to compromise for the correlation effects not considered by it .",
    "however , recent information ( experimental and theoretical ) tend to support larger depletions ( of the order of 20 - 25 % ) which are consistent with our present estimations .",
    "the remaining discrepancy may be clarified from specific future experiments of greater precision and larger momentum transfers .",

    "<S> a set of moderately deformed @xmath0 shell nuclei is employed for testing the reliability of the nuclear ground state wave functions which are obtained in the context of a bcs approach and offer a simultaneous consideration of deformation and pairing correlations effects . in this method , the mean field </S>",
    "<S> is assumed to be an axially symmetric woods - saxon potential and the effective two - body interaction is a monopole pairing force . as quantities of main interest </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen the nuclear form factors , the occupancies of the active ( surface ) orbits and the fermi sea depletion , which provide quite good tests for microscopic descriptions of nuclei within many body theories . for our comparisons with results emerging from other similar methods , </S>",
