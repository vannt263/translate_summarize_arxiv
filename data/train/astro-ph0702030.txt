    "2004 ; kamp et al .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested that fast secondary electrons produced by x - ray ionization , similar to the electrons induced by cosmic - ray ionization , can pump molecular hydrogen into excited electronic states and may be important , for example , in extra - galactic objects , herbig - haro objects , and supernova remnants ( e.g. , shemansky et al .",

    "this x - ray pumping could be observable toward disks which are irradiated by strong x - ray radiation from their central stars ( e.g. , bergin et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "as disks evolve , it is believed that the dust particles in the disks coagulate and settle toward the disk midplane as the first step of planet formation .",
    "the dust dynamics in this stage have been studied theoretically in many works ( e.g. , weidenschilling 1980 , 1997 ; nakagawa et al . 1981 , 1986 ; mizuno et al . 1988 ; mizuno 1989 ; cuzzi et al .",

    "we propose a possible observational diagnostic of the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks using line spectra and the line ratios of molecular hydrogen .    in the following sections , we model the density and temperature profiles of the gas and dust in protoplanetary disks , taking into account the x - ray and uv irradiation from a central star , as well as dust growth and settling towards the disk midplane . then , using the physical structure , we calculate the level populations and line emission of molecular hydrogen . in  2",

    "the level populations of molecular hydrogen are calculated under an assumption of statistical equilibrium from which we get the molecular hydrogen emission by solving the radiative transfer equation (  [ s2.4 ] ) . in  3 , we present the resulting dust size and spatial distributions (  [ s3.1 ] ) , the physical structure of the disks (  [ s3.2 ] ) , the level populations of molecular hydrogen (  [ s3.3 ] ) , and the line spectra and line ratios of molecular hydrogen (  [ s3.4 ] ) , in which the effects of the x - ray irradiation and the dust evolution are discussed .",

    "the physical structure and the molecular hydrogen emission of the disks are affected by the dust model in various ways ; for example , the uv radiation field through dust extinction (  [ s2.2 ] ) , the dust temperature through optical properties of dust grains , the gas temperature through grain photoelectric heating and dust - gas collisions (  [ s2.3 ] ) , and the molecular hydrogen formation rate on dust grains (  [ s2.4 ] ) . in this paper",

    "a we adopt a very simple assumption in order to understand the basic properties of the effects of dust evolution . in model b",
    "we consider a more realistic case by numerically solving the coagulation equation for settling dust particles .    in both models",
    "the shape of the dust particles is simply assumed to be a compact sphere ( see e.g. , kozasa et al . 1992 ; ossenkopf 1993 ; ormel et al .",
    "2007 for fractal dust aggregate models ) . making use of the resulting spatial and size distributions of dust grains ,",
    "the dust absorption ( @xmath0 ) and scattering ( @xmath1 ) coefficients at each position of the disk are computed by means of the mie theory ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) , with the dust particles assumed to consist of silicate , carboneous grains , and water ice ( see paper i for details ) .      in model",
    "a we assume that the dust grains have a spatially uniform distribution and the mass fractional abundance of the dust with respect to the gas is fixed at each position in the disk ( i.e. the dust grains are well mixed with the gas ) .",

    "the minimum radius is set to be @xmath5 for all models .",
    "the amount of small dust grains decreases with increasing maximum grain radii as we keep the mass fractional abundance of the dust grains to the gas fixed ( see also ",

    "now , @xmath11 in equation ( [ eq.2 - 1 ] ) is the vertical velocity and @xmath12 is the typical mass of a particle in a mass bin @xmath9 . the symbol @xmath13 is related to the sticking rate of two colliding dust particles , given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the radius of a dust particle in a mass bin @xmath9 , and we simply assume the sticking probability of @xmath16 in this paper . the fragmentation of dust particles is simply neglected in this work . for the relative velocity between two colliding particles , @xmath17 ,",
    "we adopt @xmath18 the symbol @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath21 is the dust temperature ) is the relative velocity caused by the thermal brownian motion .",
    "the symbols @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the local radial velocity component of dust particles with mass @xmath12 , arising from angular momentum loss via gas - dust friction ) are the velocity differences in the vertical and radial directions , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath25 is the turbulence - induced relative velocity ( see nomura & nakagawa 2006 for more details ) .",
    "the disk is simply assumed to be completely quiescent or turbulent , with @xmath26 in a quiescent disk model .    the mass flux in equation ( [ eq.2 - 1 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath27 in a quiescent disk , where @xmath28 is the keplerian frequency and @xmath29 is the gas density . for the drag coefficient between the gas and dust particles , @xmath30 ,",
    "we adopt @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 , following epstein s and stokes laws , respectively , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the sound speed of the gas , the solid density of a dust particle , and the mean free path of gas particles , respectively .",
    "the mean velocity of the dust particles in the vertical direction , @xmath38 , is obtained by balancing the gas - dust friction force , @xmath39 , and the gravitational force in the vertical direction , @xmath40 . in a turbulent disk ,",
    "the mass flux is written as @xmath41}}{\\displaystyle{\\partial z}}},\\ ] ] following the gradient diffusion hypothesis .",
    "for the turbulent diffusivity , we adopt @xmath42 , where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is the sound speed at the disk midplane ) is the scale height of the disk and we set @xmath45 in this paper .",
    "the global radial motion of the dust particles toward the central star is not taken into account in this work . at the disk surface",
    "this simplified treatment is applicable because large dust particles settle toward the disk midplane more rapidly than they move toward the central star ( figs .",
    "[ f3 ] and [ f4 ] in  [ s3.1 ] actually show that large particles can not stay in the surface layer ) .",
    "we note that the radial motion is negligible for the small dust particles which couple with the gas efficiently via friction force ( e.g. , adachi et al . 1976 ; weidenschilling 1977 ; takeuchi & lin 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , neglect of radial global motion will not affect our results of molecular hydrogen lines which are mainly emitted in the disk surface ( see paper i ) . in a completely quiescent disk",
    "the radial motion is negligible all over the disk ( e.g. , nakagawa et al .",
    "now , in order to avoid making very large particles which do not couple with the gas and should fall on towards the central star , we remove particles larger than some critical radius by simply assuming that when the dust particles grow large enough so that they can not be trapped in a turbulent eddy , they gain very rapid radial motion .",
    "the critical radius is estimated as @xmath46 for @xmath32 and @xmath47 for @xmath34 by comparing the friction time between the gas and dust particles , @xmath48 , and the turnover time of the largest turbulent eddy , @xmath49 .",
    "we note that the dust particles grow to be larger than @xmath50 only close to the midplane of a turbulent disk ( see  [ s3.1 ] ) . as the initial condition of the calculations",
    ", we set the dust particles to be well - mixed with the gas and the dust - to - gas mass ratio to be spatially uniform .",
    "for the initial size distribution of the dust grains , we adopt dust model a with @xmath51 , which is similar to the dust model of dense molecular clouds ( e.g. , weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",
    "we also assume that the disk is surrounded by a dense molecular cloud with gas number density @xmath52@xmath53 , and consider a continuous input of dust particles from the molecular clouds to the disk as a boundary condition at the disk surface ( @xmath54 , see below and  [ s3.1 ] ) for the calculations of dust evolution ( eq . [",
    "[ eq.2 - 1 ] ] ) .",
    "dust particles fall on to the disk because the pressure gradient force is negligibly small for them ( e.g. , landau et al .",
    "1967 ) and can not sustain them against the gravitational force of the central star ( we note that the gas is assumed to be stationary due to the pressure gradient force ) . this input of dust particles has great influence on structure of the disk surface and observational properties of the disk ( see  [ s3 ] ) . the total mass of dust particles infalling from the cloud to the disk in @xmath55 yr ( the time for which the calculations are performed ) is @xmath56 , which corresponds to a dust mass in a spherical cloud with a radius of 2,500 au and a gas density of @xmath57@xmath53 , and @xmath58 of the initial mass of dust grains in the disk .",
    "in the calculations for the dust coagulation and settling we set 23 radial grids logarithmically for @xmath59 au , and 50 vertical grids for the region where the coagulation becomes significant ( @xmath60 , see  [ s3.1 ] ) .",
    "the dust coagulation equation is solved using fixed density and temperature profiles of dust and gas because self - consistent calculations coupled to the time evolution of the dust and gas profiles are very time - consuming .",
    "instead , we get the dust distribution and the temperature and density profiles by iterating the calculations only once under an assumption that the temperature and density profiles turn into an equilibrium state very quickly ; that is , we ( a ) calculate the dust gas profiles using the initial dust distribution , ( b ) solve the coagulation equation using the temperature and density profile in ( a ) , ( c ) compute the dust and gas profiles again using the dust distribution in ( b ) , ( d ) obtain the dust distribution by solving the coagulation equation with the temperature and density profiles in ( c ) , and ( e ) finally get the dust and gas profiles using the dust distribution in ( d ) .",
    "in the calculations in  [ s3 ] we compare the gas temperature and density profiles in ( c ) and ( e ) , and checked that the errors are within 30% for the gas temperatures and",
    "80% at most for the gas densities in both quiescent and turbulent disks .",
    "these errors are relatively large at the upper layer of the disks where the molecular hydrogen is photodissociated via uv radiation from the central star , so the errors in molecular hydrogen emission from the disks ( see  [ s3.4 ] ) are smaller and within 15% for all lines .",
    "we introduce a parameter , @xmath61 , that represents the total surface area of dust particles per unit volume of the gas at each position in the disk @xmath62 , @xmath63 where @xmath64 the size distributions @xmath65 in dust model b , and @xmath66 is calculated using the dust model a with @xmath4 m , which is similar to the dust model of dense molecular clouds and is used as the initial condition for dust model b. this parameter controls the physical disk structure and molecular hydrogen emission from the disks because the grain opacity , the grain photoelectric heating rate , and the formation rate of molecular hydrogen on grain surface are roughly proportional to it .",
    "thus , the dust and gas temperatures , the uv radiation field , and the abundance of molecular hydrogen are related to @xmath61 ( see the following subsections ) . in dust model",
    "a , the parameter @xmath61 has values of 1 , 0.1 , and 0.01 for the maximum dust size of @xmath4 m , 1 mm , and 10 cm , respectively . in model b",
    ", @xmath61 decreases with dust size growth and settling ( except at the disk midplane ) , which leads to a decrease of the grain photoelectric heating rate , and thus the gas temperature and so on ( see  [ s3.1 ] for more details ) .",

    "if we take it into account , it affects the line ratio slightly with the error being about 25% for the model with @xmath270 cm in the extreme case that the contribution to the cross sections of heavy elements in the dust is negligible ( see  [ s3.2.2 ] ; wilms et al .",
    "figure [ f17 ] shows that the line ratio in the model with x - ray irradiation only is slightly larger than that in the model with uv irradiation , although the gas temperature is lower .",
    "this occurs because the level populations are not in lte , but affected by the x - ray pumping process ( see  [ s3.2.1 ] ) .",
    "we also plot in the right hand side of figure [ f17 ] the resulting line ratios for dust model b in quiescent and turbulent disks in filled and open triangles , respectively .",
    "the ratio for the model with dust grains typical of dense cloud ( model a with @xmath271 m ) is plotted as a filled circle .",
    "the results suggest that if the dust grains coagulate and settle towards the disk midplane , the ratio becomes substantially larger than the case in which dust grains do not evolve .",
    "so , our results suggest that dust evolution in protoplanetary disks could be observable through this particular line ratio .",
    "itoh et al . ( 2003 ) derived an upper limit to the line ratio of 0.26 from an observation toward a classical t tauri star , lkh@xmath73 264 , and bary et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) find an upper limit of @xmath2720.2 toward a herbig be star , hd 97048 ; all the models we used in this paper almost satisfy these observational upper limits .",
    "line ratios for the irradiation models of x - rays @xmath229 uv ( _ solid lines _ ) , uv only ( _ dashed lines _ ) , and x - rays only ( _ dot - dashed lines _ ) and dust model a with @xmath51 , 1 mm , and 10 cm ( @xmath269 , 0.1 , and 0.01 ) ( in the left - hand panel ) . the ratios for the irradiation model by x - rays @xmath229 uv with dust model b in quiescent ( _ open triangle _ ) and",
    "turbulent ( _ filled triangle _ ) disks and the dense clouds ( dust model a with @xmath51 ; _ filled circle _ ) are plotted in the right - hand panel . if the disk is irradiated by strong uv radiation , the line ratio increases with dust evolution as a consequence of the decrease in gas temperature and the increase in the uv radiation field strength .",
    "we have made a detailed model of physical structure of protoplanetary disks and calculated the level populations and line emission of molecular hydrogen , taking into account x - ray irradiation from the central star as well as dust growth and settling towards the disk midplane .",
    "we have followed the time evolution of the spatial and size distributions of dust particles in the disks by numerically solving the coagulation equation for settling dust particles .",
    "the resulting mass and total surface area of dust grains per unit gas volume is much smaller , except at the disk midplane , than those for the model in which the dense cloud dust grains are well mixed with the gas . at the disk surface",
    "the dust density normalized by the initial value , @xmath198 , and the parameter for the total surface area of dust grains , @xmath164 , are small due to the dust settling toward the disk midplane . near the disk midplane",
    "the parameter @xmath273 becomes much smaller since small dust particles are removed by dust coagulation .",
    "we have studied the effects of x - ray irradiation on the physical structure of the disks and found that the x - ray irradiation is the dominant heating source in the inner region and in the surface layers of the disk .",
    "fuv heating dominates in the middle layers and in the outer region of the disk .",
    "this is because the fuv radiation is scattered efficiently by dust grains , while the compton scattering of x - ray radiation is inefficient in the energy range of @xmath232kev in which t tauri stars mainly emit x - ray radiation .",
    "we found that the ionization rate caused by x - rays is much smaller than that due to interstellar cosmic - rays near the disk midplane because of the relatively large attenuation and inefficient scattering of x - rays .",
    "the dust evolution in the disks affects the physical disk structure , especially the gas temperature at the disk surface and the fuv radiation field within the disk . as the dust particles grow or settle towards the disk midplane , the gas temperature in the middle layers and the outer disk decreases because the grain photoelectric heating which is induced by fuv radiation becomes less efficient .",
    "meanwhile , the fuv radiation from the central star penetrates deeper into the disk due to the decrease of grain opacity .",
    "furthermore , making use of the obtained physical structure of the disks , we calculated the level populations of molecular hydrogen in the ground electronic state .",
    "our results show that if the central star has strong x - ray and weak uv radiation , the level populations are controlled by x - ray pumping .",
    "otherwise , the level populations are mainly controlled by thermal collisions or uv pumping , depending on the dust properties in the disk . as the dust particles evolve in the disk , the level populations change from lte to non - lte distributions since collisional excitation becomes less efficient due to the decrease of the gas temperature at the disk surface while uv pumping becomes more efficient owing to the stronger uv radiation field in the disk .",
    "finally , using these level populations , we calculated the line emission of molecular hydrogen from the disk .",
    "the ro - vibrational line spectra in the near - infrared wavelength band show that the emission lines from high energy levels become relatively stronger as the dust particles evolve in the disk .",
    "again , this is due to level populations changing from lte to non - lte and the populations in higher vibrational energy levels becoming relatively larger . for the pure rotational line spectra in the mid - infrared wavelength band ,",
    "it is the emission lines from lower energy levels which become relatively stronger .",
    "this is because the level populations in the ground vibrational state are in lte and the populations in lower energy levels become relatively larger with dust evolution and decreasing dust surface area which results in lower gas temperatures . for transitions in the uv wavelength band ,",
    "the dependence on the dust evolution is not so straightforward because the line fluxes decrease as the area of high temperature region shrinks , while they increase as uv irradiation from the central star penetrates deeper in the disks .",
    "basically , the line fluxes which originate from pumping from higher energy levels seem to be relatively weaker as the dust particles evolve and the gas temperature decreases .",
    "our results suggest that infrared line ratios of molecular hydrogen could be a useful probe of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks .",
    "if the dust particles evolve , the @xmath274 line ratio , for example , becomes clearly larger than that for the dense cloud dust model ( without the dust evolution ) .",
    "further observations of the line ratios of molecular hydrogen could provide some constraints on the dust evolution model in protoplanetary disks .",

    "<S> detailed models for the density and temperature profiles of gas and dust in protoplanetary disks are constructed by taking into account x - ray and ultraviolet ( uv ) irradiation from a central t tauri star , as well as dust size growth and settling toward the disk midplane . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial and size distributions of dust grains in the disks are numerically computed by solving the coagulation equation for settling dust particles , with the result that the mass and total surface area of dust grains per unit volume of the gas in protoplanetary disks are very small , except at the disk midplane . </S>",
    "<S> the level populations and line emission of molecular hydrogen are calculated using the derived physical structure of the disks . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray irradiation is the dominant heating source of the gas in the inner disk region and in the surface layer , while the far uv heating dominates otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> if the central star has strong x - ray and weak uv radiation , the level populations of molecular hydrogen are controlled by x - ray pumping , and the x - ray induced transition lines could be observable . if the uv irradiation is strong , the level populations are controlled by thermal collisions or uv pumping , depending on the properties of the dust grains in the disks . as the dust particles evolve in the disks , the gas temperature at the disk surface drops because the grain photoelectric heating becomes less efficient , while the uv radiation fields become stronger due to the decrease of grain opacity . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the level populations of molecular hydrogen change from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) to non - lte distributions , which results in changes to the line ratios of molecular hydrogen emission . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that dust evolution in protoplanetary disks could be observable through the line ratios of molecular hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> the emission lines are strong from disks irradiated by strong uv and x - rays and possessing small dust grains ; such disks will be good targets in which to observe molecular hydrogen emission . </S>"
