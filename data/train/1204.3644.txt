    "<S> then @xmath25 does not need to hold anymore because statistical effects can produce a negative value . </S>",
    "<S> however , the probability to observe large deviations from the true mean is bounded and decreases exponentially with the number of performed repetitions . a quantitative statement </S>",

    "<S> the question whether the observed data set is compatible with the assumed quantum model can now be addressed by comparing the maximal likelihoods of either model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for that , we start from the likelihood for a distribution @xmath20 given the observed frequencies @xmath55 , which is @xmath56 ignoring the multinomial prefactor . a quantum state @xmath57 that maximizes the likelihood @xmath58 is considered to be a good estimate for the physical state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the model with all independent distributions , the optimum is given by @xmath59 . </S>",
