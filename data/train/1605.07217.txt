    "the motivation for these prerequisites can be expressed in several ways .",
    "one can for example view the amplitudes @xmath36 as the projection of the partial width operator @xmath49 onto a randomly oriented space spanned by a large number of orthogonal resonant states @xmath37 so that the sign of each partial width amplitude is random and consequently averages involving odd powers @xmath50 vanish .",
    "this implies according to a classical statistical argument ( the drunken sailor problem ) that each @xmath51 has a gaussian distribution centered at the origin and is uncorrelated with the other partial width amplitudes , @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "the distribution of the corresponding partial widths is the porter - thomas distribution  @xcite .    while a gaussian probability distribution for the partial width amplitudes is a natural consequence of the statistical picture above , many results obtained on the basis of the model eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - abres ] ) appear to be well approximated by weaker conditions assuming a symmetric distribution with random sign of the variables .",
    "such a situation may occur for systems that are not fully chaotic .",
    "therefore , it is of considerable interest to understand how rapidly the above established statistical limit becomes important in practice . since the formal steps in the derivation of the cross - section autocorrelation function are identical for the case of a porter - thomas distribution and the general one , we consider the latter in the following and then confine ourselves to the former , when comparing to known analytical results and experimental data .",
    "the level correlations are introduced phenomenologically and are taken to be robust .",
    "they are assumed to coincide with those of random matrices from the goe  @xcite .",
    "the results , in fact , are sensitive only to their gross features : anticorrelations of levels at close encounter create a correlation hole on the typical scale @xmath3 corresponding to the absence of one level in that region  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the energy levels are taken to be statistically independent of the partial widths .",
    "the remaining parameters of the model are the average resonance spacing and the transmission coefficients of the channels .",
    "stated in this form , the sbw model is completely defined and can be solved in closed form for the correlations between two , three and four _ s_-matrix elements .",
    "a frequent critique concerning the sbw model is that it neglects unitarity constraints . for a dynamical model",
    "this is justified , since consistency is essential . for",
    "the phenomenological sbw model the average @xmath0-matrix elements @xmath54 depend importantly on unitarity due to the shadow of the inelastic states via the optical theorem .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of this contraint ensures that complete transmission @xmath55 indeed corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "other restrictions related to unitarity for the sbw model are expected to be small .",
    "the obvious quantitative success in describing many properties of chaotic systems is a strong justification for this procedure .",
    "we further remind the reader that regions of large probability are the ones least exposed to such constraints .",
    "in addition , the cross - section correlations studied in the following result from folding procedures deemphasizing the effect of any unitarity violation in regions of low probability .",
    "this section mainly serves to specify the notation used in the following and to illustrate schematically the method used in   for the derivation of the cross - section correlation functions within the sbw model .",

    "the aim of the present article has been to obtain an analytical approximation to the cross - section correlations and related functions for a chaotic scattering system .",
    "the analysis was based on the sbw model , extensively used previously in the asymptotic limits of narrow and strongly overlapping resonances . here , we have set three goals ( i ) firstly , to corroborate that the sbw model provides quantitative results for the @xmath0-matrix autocorrelation functions close to exact ones under rather general conditions ( ii ) secondly , to establish the general analytical expressions for the four - point @xmath0-matrix correlation functions ( iii ) thirdly , to demonstrate that these results give new insights into the physical mechanisms which produce the correlations as well as to illustrate the sensitivity of the correlation functions to their input parameters .",
    "as will be discussed below , the goals set in the introduction have been achieved and the results exceed our initial expectations .",
    "+ ( i ) the accuracy of the sbw model is already indicated by its similarity to an approximation derived analytically based on the exact results  @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite which was shown to provide a good description for the @xmath0-matrix correlation functions .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates this agreement between the approximations and the exact analytical results for different experimentally relevant situations .",
    "it emphasizes the importance of the observed channels for the overall scale and the insensitivity to the details of the remaining ones .",
    "the unitarity constraint on the @xmath0-matrix results in the optical theorem which is accounted for on the average . once this is the case , the lack of unitarity of the @xmath0-matrix approach eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - abres ] ) is of little importance for observed channels @xmath17 with @xmath280 since in the overlap region up to this correction the variances of the @xmath0-matrix correlations are identical for the sbw model and the vwz approach , which preserves unitarity .",
    "moreover , in the overlap region the cross - section variances are well described by @xmath0-matrix variances as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and  [ fig4a ] .",
    "we therefore conjecture that the unitarity corrections are equally small in this case .",
    "the good agreement of the experimental , numerical and analytical results compared in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig2 ] further emphasizes empirically that the sbw model captures the essence of the exact results correctly also for weakly overlapping and isolated resonances .",
    "+ ( ii ) the second goal of deriving closed analytical expressions for the cross - section correlation functions in the sbw model was considered unachievable in ref .  @xcite .",
    "our results are obtained by first observing that they are special cases of the four - point @xmath0-matrix correlation functions .",
    "these are more conveniently expressed in terms of irreducible four - point , three - point and two - point correlation functions , yielding a modification of the expansion given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in general",
    "there are three such irreducible four - point functions , two once reducible ones and one which is twice reducible .",
    "this expansion is particularly complex for correlations between elastic cross sections .",
    "the different irreducible terms are further simplified by appropriate contractions taking into account the level cluster correlations which depend on the overall conditions . here ,",
    "we restrict the discussion to the standard dyson level correlations  @xcite . terms depending on the three- and four - level cluster functions have been neglected since they correspond to a simultaneous close encounter of more than two levels which is intuitively unlikely to occur .",
    "results are given in   in the energy and the time representations .",
    "they are formulated very generally and cover all cases from a single channel to a large number of open channels with a large variety of transmission coefficients from the region of narrow resonances to the asymptotic region of overlapping ones .",
    "the accuracy of the analytical sbw results for the cross - section correlation functions has been tested by comparison to exact results for the cross - section variances in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and  [ fig2 ] and to experimental and rmt results for the cross - section correlation functions in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the deviation observed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the smallest value of @xmath105 may be explained by the small number of resonances in the corresponding 1  ghz window ; see  .",
    "we conclude from the agreement between the sbw model calculations and the experimental and rmt results that below @xmath176 they are nearly independent of the unitarity constraint .",
    "this is not surprising because it is largely imposed via the normal breit - wigner form of an individual resonance with an average background amplitude .",
    "as observed above , the model is conjectured to closely reproduce exact results in the region of large @xmath105 .",
    "note that in refs .",
    "@xcite analytical expressions were derived for the cross - section correlation functions that are applicable beyond the value @xmath281 , where the distributions of the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath0-matrix elements have gaussian distributions  @xcite .    like in the vwz model",
    "the present approach tacitly assumes that during the scattering process a long - lived ( quasibound ) chaotic state has been produced in a short time compared to its life - time .",
    "since the life - time of the chaotic state is inversely proportional to the weisskopf width this automatically implies that it has a maximum value set by the formation time .",
    "the latter depends on the dynamical properties in the interaction region . for an initially closed system with chaotic dynamics",
    "it can be identified with the length of the shortest periodic orbit  @xcite . in the case of an intermediate motion in an optical potential as in nuclear physics it can be deduced from the widths of the corresponding resonances and their decay to doorway states .",
    "an interesting by - product is that they apply equally well to any distribution of partial width amplitudes with random sign .",
    "we have not explored their sensitivity to the explicit form of this probablity distribution , which has always been assumed to be the normal one .",
    "we note , that the sbw model is in this respect more flexible than the rmt models which assume randomness on the level of the initial interaction with a normal distribution of the matrix elements of the associated hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , the second goal even exceeded our expectations concerning the capability of the sbw model .",
    "+ ( iii ) our third and principal goal was to improve the understanding of the different contributions generating the correlation functions and of their relevance , because the rmt approach gives only global results .",
    "the sbw results are very general covering the whole range of isolated to overlapping resonances . in view of the large variety of situations we focus on the important special case for which none of the partial widths that constitute the weisskopf width dominates . the latter approximately yields the total width .",
    "we consider two examples .",
    "the first one concerns the consequences of the transition from the region of non - overlapping , narrow resonances to the asymptotic region of overlapping ones . here",
    "the simplest situation is the inelastic cross - section autocorrelation function illustrated in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which demonstrates the change from dominance of self - correlations for @xmath282 and even beyond to that of the ericson fluctuation term with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the sum of these two contributions gives an excellent description in the entire range of @xmath283 .",
    "the corresponding elastic situation is illustrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . as for the inelastic case",
    "the self - correlations dominate for @xmath282 whereas contributions from the remaining four- and three - point correlations cancel each other systematically and substantially .",
    "the region between @xmath284 is characterized by comparable contributions from self - correlations and from the asymptotic two - point correlation term , while for larger @xmath285 the latter rapidly becomes dominant .",
    "the ericson fluctuation term is everywhere small .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn from these observations is thus that for @xmath286 the sum of the self - correlations and the asymptotic two - point term approximate the cross - section autocorrelations well in the elastic case and for larger values of @xmath283 only the two - point correlations survive .",
    "we also computed the cross - section correlation functions as function of @xmath138 and compared them to rmt results obtained via numerical simulations .",
    "figures  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig3 ] demonstrate that the latter , normalized to unity at @xmath202 , are accurately described by the sbw model and are insensitive to its details .",
    "we conclude from these observations that the central features governing chaotic cross - section correlations  as well as @xmath0-matrix correlations  are determined by the distributions of the partial width amplitudes of the observed channels .",
    "+ the sbw model provides explicitly the functional dependence of the correlation functions on the level correlations . for narrow and weakly overlapping resonances the contributions to the elastic cross - section variances",
    "are typically dominated by self - correlations .",
    "they are mainly produced by widely spaced states with exceptionally large width in the observed channels .",
    "this feature is well supported by the agreement of the sbw model results with the corresponding exact ones , illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig8 ] .",
    "the agreement with experimental data demonstrates that the porter - thomas width distribution indeed is valid over a large range for the underlying probability distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfcorr4ab ] ) and implied experimentally as well by fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "we note that the assumption that no partial width dominates can be achieved in two physically distinct ways .",
    "firstly , it can be realized in systems where the non - observed channels are either due to incoherent absorption or to a large number of channels sufficiently weak so as not to produce noticeable mixing effects , secondly by means of many channels with transmission coefficients close to unity and very large weisskopf widths as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the latter case",
    "these can coherently produce narrow ( `` trapped '' ) states as well as broad ( `` super - radiant '' ) ones .",
    "such phenomena are of different nature and beyond the framework of the present article .",
    "+ finally , we note that the approach considered in the present article can be generalized in a number of ways .",
    "in particular , we provide explicit expressions for the cross - section correlation functions of systems with width distributions different from the porter - thomas one , although we have not explored the sensitivity of the results with respect to their choice",
    ". another generalization would be the extension to systems with a broken symmetry or violated time - reversal invariance .",

    "<S> exact analytical expressions for the cross - section correlation functions of chaotic scattering systems have hitherto been derived only under special conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the objective of the present article is to provide expressions that are applicable beyond these restrictions . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation is based on a statistical model of breit - wigner type for chaotic scattering amplitudes which has been shown to describe the exact analytical results for the scattering ( @xmath0)-matrix correlation functions accurately . </S>",
    "<S> our results are given in the energy and in the time representations and apply in the whole range from isolated to overlapping resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-matrix contributions to the cross - section correlations are obtained in terms of explicit irreducible and reducible correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the model can be used for a detailed exploration of the key features of the cross - section correlations and the underlying physical mechanisms . in the region of isolated resonances , </S>",
    "<S> the cross - section correlations contain a dominant contribution from the self - correlation term . for narrow states </S>",
    "<S> the self - correlations originate predominantly from widely spaced states with exceptionally large partial width . in the asymptotic region of well - overlapping resonances , </S>",
    "<S> the cross - section autocorrelation functions are given in terms of the @xmath0-matrix autocorrelation functions . </S>",
    "<S> for inelastic correlations , in particular , the ericson fluctuations rapidly dominate in that region . </S>",
    "<S> agreement with known analytical and with experimental results is excellent . </S>"
