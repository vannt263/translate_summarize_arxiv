    "@xmath6 years in each galaxy , a star enters the bh s tidal disruption radius within which the tidal force of the bh exceeds the star s self gravity , and hence the star gets tidally disrupted @xcite . in these so - called tidal disruption events ( tdes ) , the stellar debris feeds a burst of strong accretion that generates a bright flare of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "several dozen such flares have been reported at various wavelengths , e.g. hard x - ray/@xmath7-ray @xcite , soft x - ray ( reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , uv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "if a large fraction of the stellar debris is accreted by the bh , the total energy budget is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the efficiency of energy release from accretion and depends on the bh spin .",
    "however , the observed radiation energy is usually @xmath10 , much smaller than expected . especially , the energies of the optically discovered tdes lie at the lower end ( @xmath11 ) . a possible solution to the `` efficiency problem",
    "'' could be that @xmath12 because most of the stellar debris does nt reach the bh but is blown away by a wind at a radius of @xmath13 to 100 schwarzschild radii @xcite",
    ". if the wind is dense enough , the effective photosphere could be far from the surface of the disk , and the radiation energy suffers from adiabatic loss before escaping , so the spectrum appears redder and the total radiation energy lower .",
    "another possibility is that the spectral energy distritubion ( sed ) peaks between the observable far uv and soft x - ray windows .",
    "we can see that tdes release a huge amount of radiation energy , which will have a significant impact on the interstellar medium in the immediate vicinity of the bh .",
    "for example , as pointed out by @xcite , if most of the flare s energy is radiated in the extreme uv ( @xmath14 ) , the bright flash can ionize gas of mass @xmath15 out to a radius @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the number density of h nuclei and we have assumed each h nucleus consumes @xmath19 ( ionization potential of h and he + bond energy of h@xmath20 + kinetic energy of free protons and electrons ) . in eq.([eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) , recombination is ignored because the timescale @xmath21 is expected to be long",
    ". then the energy of the ionizing flash will be slowly reprocessed into potentially observable h and he recombination lines if the gas density is high , or forbidden lines ( of metals ) if the gas density is low .",
    "however , eq.([eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) are true only if there is no dust extinction .",
    "if dust is well mixed with the gas , the v - band extinction is proportional to the gas column density and we have @xmath22 for sightlines with @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the v - band extinction of the gas with a column depth of @xmath24 is @xmath25 therefore , for our fiducial galactic center density of @xmath26 , the ionizing flash will be significantly attenuated at a radius of @xmath27 , unless dust is significantly depleted in the gas before the tde occurs .    the radiation energy will be deposited into dust grains , which then re - radiate in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "a similar process has been studied in the context of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by @xcite and @xcite . as we show in this work ,",
    "if a significant amount of dust exists in the pc - scale vicinity of the bh , the dust ir emission from tdes is much brighter than that from grbs , lasts longer , and is hence easier to observe .    before moving forward to calculations of the dust ir emission , we summarize our current ( very limited ) knowledge about the pc - scale dust content around galactic nuclei .    in the context of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ,",
    "the accretion disk and broad line region are surrounded by a thick dusty torus .",
    "the dusty torus absorbs a significant fraction of nuclear luminosity and re - radiates mid - ir continuum as observed in most agns .",
    "typically , the sky covering factor of the torus is @xmath28 and inner boundary is roughly given by the dust sublimation radius @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the disk luminosity @xcite .",
    "the torus is dynamically active @xcite , possibly coming from a clumpy wind launched from the accretion disk @xcite . for weakly - active galactic nuclei with luminosities @xmath31 ,",
    "the accretion disk can no longer sustain a wind outflow rate required by the mid - ir emission extrapolated from high - luminosity agns , so the torus is expected to disappear @xcite .",
    "this has not been observationally confirmed , because the dust emission no longer dominates in the mid - ir when @xmath32 . as pointed out by @xcite , even at these luminosities",
    ", the disk outflow can still provide a small but significant toroidal obscuration as long as the column density exceeds @xmath33 . in the context of non - active galactic nuclei ,",
    "the nuclear dust content is hard to probe due to the overwhelming starlight and telescopes limited angular resolution ( 1 arcsec @xmath34 50 pc at a distance of 10 mpc ) .",
    "currently , the only observable case is our galactic center .",
    "radio observations ( of tracer molecules ) revealed @xmath35 of molecular clouds and diffuse molecular gas at @xmath36 from the bh , mostly in a torus - like structure ( known as circum - nuclear disk , cnd ) with a sky covering factor @xmath37 viewed from the bh .",
    "inward from the cnd , due to the radiation from the central star cluster ( @xmath38 ) , the gas becomes atomic and then ionized .",

    "( 3 ) the contribution from the host galaxies could be subtracted by multi - epoch or high spacial resolution observations .    in future jwst mid - ir spectra , we can look for the smoking - gun evidences of dust , such as the silicate feature at @xmath230 or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features .",
    "\\(1 ) if a significant amount of dust exists within @xmath231 , the refractory elements al , ca , si and fe , which normally condense into solids , will gradually return to the gas phase .",
    "observing their abundances rising with time would be a direct evidence of dust sublimation .",
    "the abundances could be measured through absorption lines .",
    "\\(2 ) if the dusty clouds lie along the line of sight , as dust grains sublime , the time evolution of dust extinction may be observable with sufficient uv and optical wavelength coverages .",
    "\\(3 ) for simplicity , we have been assuming the source lightcurve to be flat , but tdes actually have uv and optical variability down to at least timescales of days .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to measure the time dependent dust ir emission in response to the variable uv and optical continuum .",
    "this so - called `` dust reverberation mapping '' method has been successfully used to determine the sublimation radius of the dusty torus in agns since the work by @xcite .      in this subsection , we discuss some potential issues that may affect the details of the dust ir emission ( but the general result in this work is unaffected ) .",
    "\\(1 ) to solve the grain temperature , we have assumed instantaneous thermal equilibrium in eq.([eq:1 ] ) .",
    "this is valid because the heat capacity of a single grain is small , and hence the cooling time is short .",
    "regardless of the composition , the upper limit of the total internal energy of a grain is @xmath232 . at a temperature of @xmath233 ,",
    "the radiative cooling rate is @xmath234 .",
    "therefore , the cooling time is @xmath235 , which means that dust grains reach thermal equilibrium nearly instantaneously .",
    "\\(2 ) we have ignored dust destruction processes other than thermal sublimation . as mentioned by @xcite in the grb context , photo - ionization of dust grains could lead to significant grain charging ( positive ) .",
    "the electric field at the surface can be so large that the grain fragments ( `` coulomb explosion '' ) or emits individual ions ( `` ion field emission '' ) , depending on how strong the grain structure is .",
    "if the grain charge is @xmath236 ( in electron units ) , the electrostatic binding energy of an electron at the grain surface is @xmath237 ( @xmath215 being the electron charge ) .",
    "photo - electric charging stops when the electrostatic binding energy exceeds the incoming photon s energy . when exposed to the intense x - ray radiation from grbs , the grain charge reaches @xmath238 @xcite ; but in the context of tdes where the radiation energy is in uv and optical , the grain charge @xmath239 is smaller than @xmath240 .",
    "the surface electric field is @xmath241 , corresponding to a stress @xmath242 .",
    "ion field emission happens when the electric field approaches @xmath243 ( to break a typical @xmath244 molecular bond across a distance of @xmath245 ) .",
    "coulomb explosion happens when the electrostatic stress is greater than the tensile strength of grains , which is uncertain . in the grb literature ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , a typical grain tensile strength @xmath246 is used .",
    "therefore , once the grain charge reaches @xmath238 , both coulomb explosion and ion field emission can happen .",
    "however , neither of these two grain destruction mechanisms are important in the tde context because the grain charge is too small . even for relativistic tdes like _ swift",
    "_ j1644 + 57 with intense x - ray emission , since the x - rays are relativistically beamed into a narrow angle , most dusty clouds only receive the more - or - less isotropic uv - optical radiation .",
    "\\(3 ) a few other complexities , which are ignored in our simple model , can be taken into account in future works .",
    "first , the heating by the scattered uv - optical photons and dust ir radiation could be included by considering the time delay and related absorption coefficient . in this way ,",
    "a spectrum of dust ir emission can be calculated and compared with future observations .",
    "second , the clumpiness of dusty clouds will affect the radiative transfer .",
    "since every clump will have a bright ( hot ) side and a dark ( cold ) side , dust temperature distributions are different in clumpy and smooth environments .",
    "this is considered in modeling the ir emission from the agn torus @xcite .",
    "last , in the radiative transfer model in section [ sec : rt ] , a single dust radius of @xmath247 is used , but the true interstellar grain population has a broad size distribution , extending from a few @xmath248 ( pah molecules ) to about @xmath249 ( or even larger ) .",
    "most mass is in the larger grains , with half - mass grain radius typically @xmath250 ( half of mass is in grains with radius above this value ) , and the smaller grains contribute most surface area and hence most uv extinction ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , at the same distance from the central source , smaller grains sublime faster than larger ones ( mostly due to higher grain temperatures ) , so it is unclear which grain size contributes most ir emission .",
    "a systematic study of grain size distribution and chemical composition could be done in the future with dust continuum radiative transfer codes such as dustymoshe / dusty/ ] ] and hyperion , although the dynamical propagation of radiation coupled with dust sublimation requires some modification of the codes .",
    "we consider the impact of the uv - optical radiation ( @xmath251 ) from tdes on the circum - nuclear medium . if the medium is dusty , the uv - optical radiation energy will be absorbed by dust within @xmath252 from the bh and re - radiated in the ir .",
    "we calculate the bolometric lightcurve from a 1-d radiative transfer model , taking into account the time - dependent heating , cooling and sublimation of dust grains .",
    "we show that the dust emission peaks at @xmath2 and has typical luminosities between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( with sky covering factor @xmath253 ranging from 0.1 to 1 ) .",
    "this is detectable by current generation of telescopes , including the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) and the _ spitzer _ space telescope . in the near future ,",
    "_ james webb _ space telescope ( jwst ) will be able to perform photometric and spectroscopic measurements . in future jwst mid - ir spectra",
    ", we can look for the smoking - gun evidence of dust , such as the silicate or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features .",
    "observations at rest - frame wavelength @xmath254 have only been reported from two tde candidates , sdss j0952 + 2143 @xcite and _ swift _ j1644 + 57 @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer _ @xmath255 flux of sdss j0952 + 2143 , although consistent with the dust emission from a tde , is likely permanent emission from dusty starburst regions or an agn .",
    "we also show that the _ spitzer _ @xmath196 and @xmath256 fluxes of _ swift _ j1644 + 57 may originate from other sources than the dust ir emission , such as the accretion disk or the external shock ( driven by the interaction between disk outflow and circum - nuclear medium ) .",
    "long - term monitoring is need to tell whether the mid - ir emission from the two event is transient or permanent .",
    "currently , a firm conclusion can not be drawn .",
    "at last , we show that the two nearby tde candidates assasn-14ae and -14li are good candidates to search for the dust ir emission .",
    "if the pc - scale dusty clouds have a sky covering factor of @xmath226 , the conservatively estimated fluxes for the two events are , respectively , @xmath257 and @xmath258 at @xmath259 .",
    "agns are known to be surrounded by a dusty torus that provides obscuration and ir emission .",
    "however , little is known about the dust content in the pc - scale vicinity of weakly- or non - active galactic nuclei .",
    "currently , the only observable example is our galactic center , where the dusty clouds has sky covering factor @xmath260 . the dust ir emission can give a snapshot of the pc - scale dust content around weak- or non - active galactic nuclei , which is hard to probe otherwise .",
