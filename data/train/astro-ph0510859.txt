    "highly accreting stars can help us to understand how the accretion disk interacts with the stellar magnetosphere and photosphere and to understand the importance of accretion in the x - ray emission in young stars .",
    "a handful of such young stars display powerful eruptive events with flux increases in the optical regime of a few magnitudes .",

    "the origin of the change in accretion rate is subject to debate , and could be triggered by close companions or thermal disk instabilities .",
    "two classes of erupting young stars have emerged : fu orionis stars ( fuors ) , which display outbursts of 4 magnitudes and more that last several decades , and exors ( named after the prototype ex lup ) , which display smaller outbursts ( @xmath8  mag ) that last from a few months to a few years and that may occur repeatedly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "v1118 ori has been known for its outbursts in the past ( e.g. , 1983 - 84 , 1988 - 90 , 1992 - 94 , 1997 - 98 ; see @xcite for details ) . for this 2005 outburst ,",

    "events were extracted using circles with radii of 20   for v1118 ori and 60   for the background located in a nearby source - free region . for the 2001 observation , when only mos2 data were available , we used circles of similar sizes as above at the expected position of v1118 ori and for the background . although ellipses would better represent the shape of the point - spread - function at large off - axis angles where v1118 ori fell on the mos2 detector",

    "we obtained optical ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) and near - infrared ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) photometry using the smarts 1.0  m and 1.3  m telescopes .",

    "the x - ray flux stayed relatively constant and showed no strong variability due to , e.g. , flares .",
    "we have thus used the full duration of the observations for our spectral analysis .",

    "the observations in 2001 and 2002 are useful to determine the pre - outburst x - ray properties of v1118 ori and compare them with those in the early phases of outburst in 2005 .",
    "unfortunately , v1118 ori was not detected in 2001 down to @xmath36  ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath6   ( 95% bayesian upper limit ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it was detected in 2002 ( see * ? ? ? * ) and its x - ray spectrum was dominated by a hot plasma ( @xmath37  mk ) and low @xmath35 ( @xmath38  @xmath1 ) after we fixed the metallicity at the outburst value , @xmath39 ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : xray ] ) .",
    "the _ chandra _   january 2005 observation collected too few counts to fit a conventional binned spectrum .",
    "we have instead used a maximum - likelihood fit method for unbinned data as described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the method compares the distribution of the event energies with the spectral energy distribution of template spectra characterized by the plasma @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath40 , for a fixed metallicity ( we adopted @xmath39 ) .",
    "we determined that the plasma in v1118 ori was hot ( @xmath41  mk ) , similar to the pre - outburst 2002 data .",
    "we fitted the _",
    "xmm - newton _",
    "epic pn and mos spectra of february 2005 simultaneously .",
    "whereas the x - ray flux and @xmath35 did not vary much compared to january 2005 and september 2002 , the x - ray spectrum of v1118 ori was instead dominated by a cooler @xmath42  mk plasma with @xmath43 . to establish whether a real change in plasma temperature and @xmath35 occurred between 2002 and february 2005",
    ", we performed simultaneous fits of these spectra , with each parameter ( i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) in turn ( a ) tied to be the same value in both observations but free to vary , and ( b ) allowed to vary independently .",
    "we kept @xmath44 fixed to 0.17 but left the normalizations free to vary in each observation .",
    "@xmath45-test results confirmed that the joint fit was significantly improved by allowing the temperature to be different ( @xmath46 , for a probability of @xmath47 that the improvement is by chance ) . on the other hand , allowing different @xmath35 for a model with two temperature components was not significantly better ( @xmath48 , for a probability of @xmath49 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the observed ( absorbed ) x - ray fluxed spectra in the hard 2002 pre - outburst state and in the february 2005 soft outburst state .",
    "the march 2005 _ xmm - newton _  data were of lower quality than those of february 2005 , due to a much higher background level resulting from solar activity .",
    "the pn data were more affected than the mos data , so we fitted only the mos1 and mos2 spectra simultaneously .",
    "we obtained cool temperatures of @xmath50  mk for plasma abundances between @xmath51 ( best - fit abundance ) and @xmath39 ( fixed value of february 2005 ) .",
    "as above , we performed simultaneous fits of the march and february 2005 spectra .",
    "@xmath45-test results confirmed that the fit quality did not improve when the temperature ( @xmath52 for a probability of @xmath53 ) or @xmath35 ( @xmath54 for a probability of @xmath55 ) were allowed to be different in the two observations .",
    "however , the same comparison of the march 2005 data with that of september 2002 found a significant improvement in fit quality when we allowed the temperatures to be different ( @xmath56 with a probability of @xmath57 ) although not the @xmath35 ( @xmath58 with a probability of @xmath59 ) .",
    "thus , the march 2005 plasma temperature is significantly cooler than in 2002 , while in line with the temperature observed in february 2005 . in conclusion , at some point after the initial outburst , a marked change in plasma temperature occurred , which has remained unchanged on a time scale of at least one month .",
    "the x - ray properties of the 2005 outburst of the exor - type star v1118 ori are remarkable in view of its temperature change , which was not immediate but occurred a few months after the onset of the outburst in the optical and near - infrared regimes .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray flux and luminosity of v1118 ori varied by only a factor of two during the outburst and compared to the serendipitous observation in 2002 .",
    "the fluxes in the optical and near - infrared varied more significantly , within factors of @xmath60 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the hydrogen column density stayed relatively low , @xmath61  @xmath1 , throughout the observations , giving no indication for additional absorption during the outburst .",
    "the disappearance of the hot plasma component , replaced by a dominant cool plasma in february and march 2005 , is intriguing .",
    "there was no evidence that the high temperatures observed in 2002 and january 2005 were due to flares .",
    "first , the x - ray light curves showed no evidence for flares .",
    "second , flares in magnetically active stars are accompanied by increases in both flux and luminosity .",
    "however , the x - ray fluxes , e.g. , in 2002 ( @xmath62 \\times 10^{-14}$ ]  ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath6 ) and in february 2005 ( @xmath63  ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath6 ) are similar . in addition , the x - ray luminosity in february 2005 is about twice as large as the x - ray luminosity in 2002 .",
    "thus , it is plausible that the dramatically increased accretion rate onto the star is responsible , directly or indirectly , for the change in the plasma temperature .",
    "when the accretion disk closed in near the star due to the increase in mass accretion rate , as suggested by models for accreting binaries ( @xcite ) , it plausibly disrupted the magnetosphere . using the scaling laws of @xcite , the height of a magnetic loop , @xmath64 ,",
    "is related to the temperature at its apex ( most of the emission measure in a loop has a similar temperature ) and the average electron density , @xmath65 in @xmath66 , as @xmath67 in cm .",
    "if the loops have a density of @xmath68 is @xmath69  @xmath66 , as is consistent with the densities observed in magnetically active stars @xcite , we get loop heights of @xmath70 cm for @xmath71  mk , i.e. , of the order of the stellar radius ( @xmath72  cm ) . in contrast , cooler loops ( e.g. , @xmath42  mk ) have ten times smaller heights , i.e. , they are smaller than the stellar radius and thus compact compared to the dimensions of the accretion disk ; thus , when the accretion disk grows inward due to an increased mass accretion rate , the hotter loops interact first with the accreting matter and are likely to be disrupted . a new magnetic configuration then may have led preferentially to compact cool loops , thus enhancing the emission measure of the previously undetected cool coronal component .",
    "the above properties contrast with those of another erupting young star , v1647 ori , which displayed a strong x - ray flux increase coincident with the optical / near - infrared outburst @xcite .",
    "in addition , v1647 ori displayed a high @xmath35 ( @xmath73  @xmath1 ) which was interpreted as an indication for a dense disk wind @xcite .",
    "a cool component was detected together with the hot component in v1647 ori , but @xcite interpreted the former component as accretion shocks onto the stellar photosphere .",
    "it is unlikely that the cool component in v1118 ori originates from shocks because free - fall velocities of matter falling from the truncation radius are too slow .",
    "even if x - rays would be generated in shocks , they would likely be too absorbed to be detected @xcite .",
    "the v1118 ori observations suggest that the enhanced mass accretion rate during its outburst likely had an indirect impact on the star s x - ray emission .",
    "long - term multi - wavelength monitoring will provide important clues to understanding the importance of accretion in the x - ray emission in highly accreting young stars .",
