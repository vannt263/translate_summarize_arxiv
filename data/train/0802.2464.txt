    "we have performed a series of experiments on the -ray spectroscopy of @xmath12 hypernuclei using a germanium detector array called hyperball @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of these experiments is to study the spin dependence of the @xmath10 interaction via precise measurements of level spacings in @xmath13-shell hypernuclei . in this paper",
    ", we report on results for the and hypernuclei investigated via the  reaction at the brookhaven national laboratory .      in principle",
    ", interactions between baryons can be studied by baryon - baryon scattering experiments . however , such scattering experiments are extremely difficult except for the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath15 ) case due to the short lifetimes of the other baryons . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath12-hypernuclear data can provide information on the @xmath10 interaction .",
    "free hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath16 ) interaction models have been theoretically constructed as extensions of @xmath15 interaction models by assuming flavor su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "effective @xmath16 interactions have often been approximated as a g - matrix derived from the free @xmath16 interaction , either in nuclear matter as a function of density @xcite or using the pauli exclusion operator for finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "many - body effects entering into the calculation of the effective interaction for a finite shell - model space from the g - matrix are small , except for the effects of coupling @xmath12-hypernuclear and @xmath17-hypernuclear states ( @xmath12-@xmath17 coupling ) @xcite .",
    "this is in part due to the lack of pauli blocking for a @xmath12 in a @xmath12 hypernucleus and in part because the @xmath10 interaction is relatively weak because one - pion exchange is forbidden due to isospin conservation . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath10@xmath18 interaction can be mediated by one - pion exchange and it is found to play a significant role in the energy - level spacings of s - shell hypernuclei despite the @xmath19 mev @xmath12@xmath17 mass difference @xcite .",
    "a hypernucleus ( ) has a spin - doublet ( @xmath20 ) structure when the core nuclear ( ) level has non - zero spin ( @xmath21 ) and the @xmath12 is in the 0@xmath22 orbit . in this simple weak - coupling limit , the splitting of the doublet is due only to @xmath10 interactions that involve the @xmath12 spin ( see eq .",
    "( [ lneff ] ) below ) together with a contribution from @xmath12@xmath17 coupling . therefore ,",
    "such spin - doublet structures in hypernuclei provide us with information on the spin - dependence of the @xmath10 interaction .    the @xmath10 effective interaction @xcite",
    "can be written in the form @xmath23 . \\label{lneff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the terms correspond to the spin - averaged and spin - spin central , the @xmath12-spin - dependent spin - orbit ( @xmath12-spin - orbit ) , the nucleon - spin - dependent spin - orbit ( @xmath24-spin - orbit ) , and the tensor interactions , respectively . for @xmath25 configurations in @xmath13-shell hypernuclei",
    ", there are five independent two - body matrix elements @xmath26 that can be written in terms of radial integrals associated with each of these terms .",
    "the radial integrals are conventionally denoted by the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively  @xcite , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 the coefficients of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( because @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath35 for a @xmath12 in an @xmath22 orbit ) . since @xmath27 contributes equally to all levels ,",
    "the level spacings are given by a linear combination of the four spin - dependent parameters and corresponding core level spacings .",
    "as noted above , only @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath31 contibute to doublet spacings in the weak - coupling limit .    for the same p - shell model space , the @xmath10@xmath18 interaction can be written and parametrized in the same way as the @xmath10 effective interaction  @xcite . for a fixed @xmath12@xmath17 coupling interaction ,",
    "the four @xmath10 parameters that govern the spin dependence of the interaction can be determined phenomenologically to fit various @xmath13-shell hypernuclear level spacings .",
    "in particular , a level spacing which is dominantly given by one parameter provides the parameter value almost independently of the others .",
    "for example , if the core state has @xmath36 only @xmath28 contributes to the doublet spacing .",
    "this is the case for the ground - state doublet spacing in ( @xmath37 ) due to an almost pure @xmath38 configuration for the core ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "similarly , if the ( @xmath40 ) core state for the excited - state doublet in ( @xmath41 ) has @xmath42 and @xmath43 , only @xmath29 contributes to the doublet spacing .",
    "then , by comparing the experimentally determined parameter values with the predicted values by theoretical models of @xmath16 interactions , we can test the validity of the models .",
    "however , effects of @xmath16 interactions on hypernuclear levels are small .",
    "in particular , spin - doublet spacings of @xmath13-shell and heavier hypernuclei are expected to be much smaller than 1 mev . in some cases , hypernuclei have quite small spin - doublet spacings of the order of a few tens of kev leading to the use of the term `` hypernuclear fine structure '' .",
    "therefore , an energy resolution of the order of several kev is necessary for spectroscopic studies to resolve the level spacings .",
    "thus , -ray spectroscopy with germanium ( ge ) detectors has exclusive access to these structures .",
    "for this purpose , a ge detector array dedicated to the -ray spectroscopy of hypernuclei , hyperball , was built in 1998 @xcite and a project to investigate precise structure of hypernuclei started .",
    "the energy levels of @xmath12 hypernuclei were studied by  and  reaction spectroscopy and by -ray spectroscopy with nai counters prior to the start of the hyperball project in 1998 .",
    "information on the spin - spin interaction can be obtained from the observations of the @xmath44 mev spin - flip m1 transitions between the ground - state doublet ( @xmath45 ) in and with nai counters  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that @xmath12-@xmath17 coupling can make a large contribution to these doublet spacings  @xcite . recently",
    ", four - body calculations have been performed  @xcite for a number of the nijmegen @xmath16 potential models with the result that both the spin - spin interaction and @xmath12-@xmath17 coupling make significant ( comparable ) contributions to the splitting .",
    "a small @xmath12-spin - orbit interaction was reported for the first time based on the fact that the splitting between the @xmath46 and @xmath47 substitutional states in is close that of the underlying hole states of the @xmath48o core  @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the -ray spectroscopy of with nai counters suggested a very small spin - orbit strength corresponding to @xmath49 mev from a limit of @xmath50 kev for the spacing of the 3-mev excited - state doublet ( @xmath41 ) based on the fact that the width of the peak containing both @xmath2 rays was comparable with the resolution of @xmath51 kev  @xcite .    in 1998 , high - precision -ray spectroscopy experiments for and were carried out with hyperball using the  and the  reactions , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the ground - state doublet spacing of 692 kev in provided a spin - spin parameter value of @xmath52 mev without the inclusion of @xmath12-@xmath17 coupling . in the @xmath13 shell",
    ", the scale of energy shifts due to @xmath12-@xmath17 coupling is expected to be roughly a factor of 4 smaller ( with a strong state dependence ) than that for the @xmath53 hypernuclei  @xcite , and provides only about 12% of the ground - state doublet spacing in .",
    "a strength of @xmath54 mev was also established from the excitation energy of the @xmath55 state in  @xcite .    in the next experiment ,",
    "the rather small spacing of the @xmath41 doublet in noted above was resolved  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath56 state has been determined to be the upper member of the doublet based on @xmath57b target data from the present experiment @xcite .",
    "the spacing of 43(5 ) kev leads to @xmath58 mev @xcite .",
    "the sign and magnitude of @xmath29 are consistent with the ordering and spacing of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 states in measured with a nai counter array  @xcite",
    ".    the energy - level spacings discussed above are not very sensitive to the tensor interaction .",
    "consequently , for the derivation of other three parameters ( @xmath61 and @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 was assumed to be in the range of values 0.01  0.06 mev predicted using @xmath10 interactions from the nijmegen one - boson - exchange ( obe ) models ( nsc97f , nsc89 , nd and nf ) in @xmath62-matrix calculations  @xcite . with @xmath31 taken to be 0.030 mev , the remaining @xmath10 parameters that fit almost perfectly the four bound excited states of  @xcite are ( parameters in mev ) @xmath63      among the four @xmath10 spin - dependent interactions ,",
    "only direct information on the @xmath10 tensor interaction has not been obtained experimentally .",
    "the derivation of the tensor interaction strength is important not only to complete the set of parameters but also to remove the theoretical assumption implicit in the derivation of the other three parameter values .",
    "the strong @xmath15 tensor interaction is well understood by one - pion exchange , reduced at short distances by rho exchange .",
    "but in the case of @xmath10 , these exchanges are forbidden due to the zero isospin of the @xmath12 . the corresponding pseudo - scalar @xmath64 and vector @xmath65 exchanges",
    "are allowed but cancel strongly because their masses are more similar than those of the @xmath66 and the @xmath67  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the obe models predict small strengths for the tensor interaction .",
    "this , and a relatively small variation for different models , can be seen from table  xi of ref .",
    "@xcite for the nijmegen hard - core and soft - core models , and from table  xx of ref .",
    "@xcite for the extended soft - core models .",
    "the ground - state doublet spacings in @xmath46-shell hypernuclei have large contributions from the tensor interaction .",
    "for example , in the simplified @xmath68 coupling model  @xcite , the ground - state doublet spacings of and are given by @xmath69 while the @xmath56 , @xmath70 spacing in is 1.5 times larger . in contrast , the spacing of the doublet based on the @xmath47-hole state of , @xmath71 has a coefficient of @xmath31 relative to @xmath28 that is an order of magnitude smaller than for the @xmath46 doublet in eq .",
    "( [ p12 ] ) .    however , the difficulty of determining the tensor interaction strength is due not only to its small value but also to the small spacings of the spin doublets for which @xmath31 contributes strongly .",
    "since @xmath31 is expected to have a small positive value , and @xmath28 has a relatively large positive value , the contributions of @xmath28 and @xmath31 are expected to cancel strongly in @xmath46-shell hypernuclei , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ p12 ] ) .",
    "hence the spacings are expected to be quite small and the ordering of the states in a doublet can be uncertain .",
    "a small spacing also means that the lifetime of the upper member of a doublet may be long compared with the lifetime for weak decay ( @xmath72 ps ) .",
    "in this situation , the only safe way to measure a doublet spacing is to measure the energies of @xmath2-rays feeding both members of the doublet from a higher level .      in order to study the @xmath12n tensor interaction ,",
    "the  reaction on @xmath3o is ideal because bound states of both and can be produced .",

    "however , for a small spacing of less than 100 kev , the detection efficiency of hyperball becomes small .",
    "in addition , the weak decay of @xmath12 in nuclei ( @xmath95 ps ) would compete with the m1 transition for a spacing of less than 100 kev .",

    "this is what would be expected if the nuclei at the end of the @xmath13 shell were significantly larger than those at the beginning of the shell .",
    "however , it is well known that the charge radii of stable @xmath13-shell nuclei are almost constant throughout the shell @xcite , essentially because the @xmath13-shell nucleons become more deeply bound for the heavier nuclei . in fact , if one calculates the @xmath10 matrix elements from a yng interaction using woods - saxon wave functions , they tend to be slightly larger for @xmath374 than for @xmath375 @xcite .",
    "this is what led to the choice of @xmath376 mev in the first analysis of our data @xcite .",
    "now , the data on the upper doublets in and ( with some reservations ) imply a smaller value of @xmath377 mev .    confidence in this value of @xmath28 is increased by the fact that the ground - state doublet spacing in has been established as 264 kev @xcite and is reproduced by this value of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "it is notable that a value @xmath378 mev was proposed @xcite to account for the non - observation of the ground - state doublet transition in above 100 kev in the first hypernuclear experiment with ge @xmath2-ray detectors @xcite ( a result confirmed in the present experiment using a @xmath57b target @xcite ) .",
    "a @xmath2-ray spectroscopy experiment on and was performed at the bnl - ags d6 beamline employing a high quality 0.93 gev / c @xmath121 beam and the hyperball ge detector array .",
    "the experiment is one of a series aimed at studies of spin - dependent @xmath10 interactions through the precise measurement of @xmath2-ray transitions in @xmath13-shell hypernuclei .",
    "the bound states of both hypernuclei were produced via the  reaction .",
    "we succeeded in observing three -ray transitions in and three in .    for , we determined the level scheme for the four bound negative - parity states [ two doublets , ( @xmath98 , @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath5 , @xmath93 ) ] from these  rays , although another assignment for the @xmath5 state is not excluded . in particular , we determined the excitation energy of the @xmath93 state to be @xmath379 kev and found a small spacing of @xmath380 kev for the ground - state doublet ( @xmath6 , @xmath8 ) with the @xmath8 state being the ground state .",
    "the doublet spacing determines a small but nonzero strength for the @xmath10 tensor interaction and this is the first experiment to give direct information on the @xmath10 tensor interaction .",
    "one of the three  rays in is likely to be a transition from the @xmath5 spin - flip state to the one of the ground - state doublet members ( @xmath381 ) and this constitutes the first observation of the direct production of a spin - flip state via the  reaction .    for , we observed a rather sharp 2268-kev @xmath2 ray and measured the corresponding lifetime via the doppler - shift attenuation method to be @xmath382 ps .",
    "the @xmath2 ray was interpreted as a transition from the @xmath9 level of to the @xmath358 member of the ground - state doublet . because the transition to the @xmath383 member of the ground - state doublet was not observed ( a limit of @xmath384% was put on the @xmath2-ray branch ) , the spacing and the spin ordering of the ground - state doublet were not determined , but we obtained an upper limit on the spacing energy of @xmath385 kev .",
    "we also observed the -ray transitions which can be assigned to those from the upper - doublet states @xmath386 to the @xmath9 state .",
    "we also measured the reaction angle ( @xmath102 ) distributions of the and  rays .",
    "analysis of the distributions of  rays provides information on the spins of the initial states of decaying to the excited states of via proton emission .",
    "the level spectra obtained for and are consistently explained by the set of values for the @xmath10 interaction parameters @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 in eq .",
