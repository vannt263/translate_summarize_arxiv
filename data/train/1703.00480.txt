    "even though it has not been possible to construct a quantum theory of gravity , there are many proposals for quantum gravity , and such proposals can have interesting physical consequences amelinob , amelinoc , mogueijosb , smolin .",
    "in fact , many of these proposals have predict similar physical consequences , and one such almost universal prediction of many different approach to quantum gravity is the deformation of the standard relativistic dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "such a deformation of the standard relativistic dispersion relation occurs in various different approaches to quantum gravity , such as the spacetime discreteness @xcite , spacetime foam models @xcite , spontaneous symmetry breaking of lorentz invariance in string field theory @xcite , and spin - network in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the standard energy - momentum dispersion relation gets deformed to a modified dispersion relation ( mdr ) near the planck scale .",
    "it is possible to use mdr to explain certain astronomical and cosmological observations , such as the threshold anomalies of ultra high energy cosmic rays and tev photons amelinolna , colladay , takeda , finkbeiner , myers , jacobson , amelinoe .",
    "the mdr is based on the existence of a maximum energy scale , and it has been possible to construct a theory with such an intrinsic maximum energy scale @xcite . this theory is called the doubly special relativity , and in this theory the planck energy ( @xmath0 ) and the velocity of light ( @xmath1 ) are two universally invariant quantities . just as it is not possible for a particle to attain a velocity greater than the velocity of light in special relativity , it is not possible for a particle to attain an energy larger than the planck energy in doubly special relativity . in the doubly special relativity , the lorentz transformations are deformed to a set of nonlinear lorentz transformation in momentum space .",
    "in fact , this deformation of the lorentz transformations directly deforms the standard energy - momentum relation .",
    "it has been possible to extend the doubly special relativity to curved spacetime and obtain doubly general relativity mogueijosc . in this theory",
    ", one assumes that the geometry of spacetime depends on the energy of the test particle .",
    "so , we do not have a single metric describing the geometry of spacetime , but a one - parameter family of energy dependent metrics .",
    "these metrics depend on the energy of the test particles .",
    "as we have a family of energy dependent metrics in such a theory , this theory is called the gravity s rainbow @xcite .    recently , gravity s rainbow has been used to study the high energy behavior of various physical systems galanm , hackett , aloisio , linglz , garattinim , chang , santos , alik .",
    "the rainbow deformation of various black hole solutions have been performed , and their properties have been studied galanmb , ali , gimka , gimkb , muwy , hendifep , hendipem .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium for compact objects and the structure of neuron stars has also been investigated using the gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effects of gravity s rainbow on wormholes have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "the gravity s rainbow has also been used for analyzing the effects of rainbow functions on gravitational force and starobinsky model of @xmath2 gravity @xcite .    it may be noted that string theory can be regarded as two dimensional theory , and the target space metric can be regarded as a matrix of coupling constants for this two dimensional theory .",
    "these coupling constants will flow due to the renormalization group flow , and so the target space metric will depend on the scale at which spacetime is probed , but this scale would in turn depend on the energy of the test particle used to probe this spacetime .",
    "thus , the target space metric in string theory would depend on the energy of the probe , and so gravity s rainbow is motivated from string theory @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the low energy effective field theory approximation to the heterotic string theory gross , metsaevta , produces the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) gravity @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the low - energy expansion of string theory effective action contains the gb term and a scalar field @xcite .",
    "it is possible to neglect the effect of this scalar field as it can be regarded as a constant field .",
    "the gb gravity contains curvature - squared terms , and is free of ghosts .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding field equations contain no more than second derivatives of the metric boulwared , zumino , callan , cai .",
    "black object solutions have also been studied in gb gravity myerss , chon , mignemi , chengo , bogdanos , hendie , cails , brihaye , gaete , ayzenberg .",
    "as both gb gravity and gravity s rainbow can be motivated from string theory , there is a strong motivation to study rainbow deformation of gb gravity .",
    "in fact , the thermodynamics of black holes has been studied using a combination of the gravity s rainbow and gb gravity @xcite .",
    "we also note that gb gravity has been used for analyzing various cosmological models deruelle , kimm , amendola , leith , elizalde , brihayer , chingangbamstt , bamba , capozziello , kanti .",
    "the frw cosmology in einstein gravity s rainbow has also been analyzed @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the universe is nonsingular in this model , however , it is important to analyze other cosmological models , so that we can know if this is a model dependent effect or a general feature of gravity s rainbow .",
    "furthermore , no work has been done on cosmological applications of gb - gravity s rainbow , even though there are strong string theoretical motivations to perform this analysis .",
    "so , in this paper , we are going to analyze a cosmological model using gb - gravity s rainbow .",
    "it will be observed that this model is also nonsingular , and so it seems that removal of big bang singularity because of the rainbow deformation is a general feature of rainbow deformation of any model of gravity .",
    "here , we are going to modify frw universe in the einstein gravity s rainbow .",
    "we consider the lagrangian of einstein gravity with a matter field as @xmath3where @xmath4 is the ricci scalar and @xmath5 is the lagrangian of matter .",
    "variation of the action ( [ le ] ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath6 leads to @xmath7where @xmath8  is the einstein tensor .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be expressed as @xmath9where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the energy density and the pressure of perfect fluid , respectively . here",
    "@xmath12 is defined as @xmath13and it is a unit vector @xmath14    now , as we want to analyze this model using gravity s rainbow , we will first review gravity s rainbow .",
    "the gravity s rainbow is based on the deformation of the standard energy - momentum dispersion relation , @xmath15where @xmath16 and the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are called rainbow functions , and @xmath19 is the mass of the test particle . in the ir limit ,",
    "we have @xmath20 and so the standard energy - momentum dispersion relation is recovered in the ir limit of this theory .",
    "thus , the gravity s rainbow reduces to standard general relativity in the ir limit . as the planck energy is the largest energy that a particle can attain ,",
    "we can write @xmath21    the exact forms of the rainbow functions are constructed using various theoretical and observational motivations .",
    "in fact , the study that was done on the hard spectra from gamma - ray bursts has been used as a motivation to construct the following rainbow functions @xcite @xmath22 now after substituting it in eq .",
    "( [ deforem ] ) , we can find the corresponding mdr @xmath23    in order to compare the results of einstein gravity with gb theory , one should reformulate them with identical dimensions .",
