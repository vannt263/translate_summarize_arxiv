    "the possibility of computing quantities of topological or geometric nature was recognized as a major achievement for quantum information theory in a series of paper by michael freedman and co ",
    "workers @xcite ( see also @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "their ` topological quantum computation ' setting , intrinsically fault  tolerant and protected from decoherence , was designed to comply with the behavior of ` modular functors ' of @xmath10 chern  simons  witten ( csw ) non  abelian topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) @xcite , the gauge group being typically @xmath1 . in physicists language ,",
    "such functors are partition functions and correlators of the quantum theory and , owing to gauge invariance and invariance under diffeomorphisms , which freeze out local degrees of freedom , they share a global , ` topological ' character .",
    "more precisely , the physical observables are associated with topological invariants of knots the prototype of which is the jones polynomial @xcite and the generating functional is an invariant of the @xmath0dimensional ambient manifold , the reshetikhin  turaev ",
    "witten invariant @xcite .    the search for efficient quantum algorithms to compute ( approximations of ) knot invariants",
    "has been carried out by several groups in the last few years .",
    "+ within the framework of topological quantum computation the existence of an effective procedure has been taken for granted by resorting to the fact that this model is polynomially reducible to the standard quantum circuit model @xcite .",
    "later on , this implicit proof has been supported by the fundamental notion of ` additive approximation ' introduced in @xcite and borrowed in all the alternative approaches .",
    "+ the first explicit algorithm for the jones polynomial of a knot presented as the plat closure of a braid has been constructed in @xcite by efficiently approximating unitary matrices associated with a particular representation of the braid group , while in @xcite the knot presentation and the representation of the braid group are generalized ( these notions will be defined in the following sections ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that both these approaches rely on the standard model of quantum computation , namely the quantum circuit model based on qubits , elementary unitary gates and related algorithmic techniques such as the so  called hadamard trick @xcite .",
    "+ the approach we proposed in @xcite differs from the previous ones in many respects .",
    "first , we were able to handle more general knot invariants , namely ` colored ' link polynomials ( a link is a multicomponent knot ) which reduces to jones in a particular case .",
    "secondly , the model of quantum computation we adopted , that we refer to as the @xmath3deformed spin network model , is in some sense a blending of the computational schemes mentioned above framed within the background provided by the theory of finite  states quantum machines @xcite .",
    "this topic will be addressed in section 2 , while a few conceptual questions and implications of our model of computation will be discussed in the last section of this introduction .    in the main part of the paper , section 3 ,",
    "we extend our efficient algorithm for approximating colored link polynomial to deal with ` quantum ' @xmath0manifold invariants .    in order to overcome the difficulties due to the fact that we shall resort to concepts and definitions arising in many different contexts ( low  dimensional topology , quantum group theory , csw field theory , @xmath0dimensional quantum gravity models , classical and quantum complexity theory )",
    ", we shall illustrate in the next few paragraphs the basic conceptual tools underlying the construction of such ` universal ' invariants .",
    "the term ` quantum topology ' was introduced by turaev @xcite to denote implications on the topological side of the algebraic theory of quantum groups technically , deformations of universal enveloping algebras of lie groups .",
    "the latter , based on the pioneering work of drinfeld @xcite and jimbo @xcite , was inspired by theoretical physics from its very beginning since quantum groups and associated @xmath11matrix representations are the basic tools of quantum inverse scattering methods and are the backbone of exactly solvable models in statistical mechanics @xcite .    the deformation parameter @xmath3 was originally assumed to be a real number related to planck constant by @xmath12 , therefore it is commonly referred to as a ` quantum ' deformation , while the ` classical ' , undeformed lie group simmetry is recovered at the particular value @xmath13 ( @xmath14 . when dealing with quantum invariants of knots and @xmath0manifolds @xcite @xmath3 is most often a complex root of unity , the case @xmath13 being considered as the ` trivial ' one . however , in a topologist s language , ` classical ' topological invariants are not the @xmath15counterparts of ` quantum ' invariants , but rather the usual invariants of algebraic and geometric topology , typically related to the fundamental group and homology groups of manifolds and submanifolds .",
    "as roberts remarks in the introduction to @xcite the standard topological invariants were _ created _ in order to distinguish between things and , owing to their intrinsic definitions , it is clear what kind of properties they reflect .",
    "for instance , the euler number @xmath16 of a smooth , closed and oriented surface @xmath17 determines completely its topological type and can be defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of handles of @xmath17 . on the other hand , quantum invariants of knots and @xmath0manifolds were _ discovered _ , but their indirect constuction based on quantum group technology often hides information about the purely topological properties they are able to detect .",
    "what is lost at the topological level is however well paid back by the possibility of bridging this theory with a plenty of issues in pure mathematics and theoretical physics ( _ cfr . _ the review @xcite and the list of references therein ) . to the early connections mentioned above ( quantum inverse scattering , exact solvable models )",
    "it is worth adding the operator algebra approach used originally by jones in defining his knot polynomial @xcite .",
    "however , the most profitable development of the theory was that suggested by schwarz and formalized by witten @xcite ( see @xcite for a review and original references ) .    indeed , recognizing quantum invariants as partition functions and vacuum expectation values of physical observables in chern ",
    "witten topological quantum field theory provides a ` physical ' explanation of their existence and properties .",
    "even more radically , one could speak of a ` conceptual ' explanation , as far as the topological origin of these invariants keeps on being unknown . in this wider sense , quantum topology",
    "might be thought of as the mathematical substratum of an @xmath1 csw topological field theory quantized according to the path integral prescription ( the coupling constant @xmath20 is constrained to be an integer related to the deformation parameter @xmath3 by @xmath21 ) .",
    "+ the csw environment provides not only the physical interpretation of quantum invariants but it does include as well all the historically distinct definitions @xcite . in particular , monodromy representations of the braid group @xcite appear in a variety of conformal field theories since point  like",
    "` particles ' confined in @xmath22dimensional regions evolve along braided worldlines ( @xcite and references therein ) . as a matter of fact , the natural extension of csw theory to a @xmath0manifold @xmath23 endowed with a non empty @xmath22dimensional boundary @xmath24 induces on @xmath24 a specific quantized boundary conformal field theory , namely the @xmath1 wess  zumino  witten ( wzw ) theory at level @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the latter provides in turn the framework for dealing with @xmath26colored links presented as closures of oriented braids and associated with kaul unitary representation of the braid group @xcite . a further extension of this representation proposed by the same author in @xcite",
    "is used in this paper to construct explicitly the quantum @xmath0manifold invariants in the form originally defined in @xcite within a purely algebraic setting .",
    "such quantities are essentially the reshetikhin  turaev ",
    "witten invariants @xcite evaluated for @xmath0manifolds presented as complements of knots / links in the @xmath0sphere @xmath27 , up to an overall normalization .",
    "+      as mentioned in the introductory remarks , the ` quantum field ' computer @xcite is a model of computation designed to process quantities of topological nature arising in csw environment and thus ` effienciency ' of any calulation such as that of jones knot polynomial should be guaranteed by definition ( we leave aside here the issue of ` exact ' _ versus _ ` approximate ' calculation at least for the moment ) .",
    "+ however , when dealing with algorithmic questions , the model of computation adopted should comply with the commonly accepted paradigms of theoretical computer science . turing machines , together with the polynomially equivalent circuit models based on elementary boolean gates , represent the universal schemes which allow problems and algorithms to be grouped into classical complexity classes @xcite . in quantum computing ,",
    "the notions of quantum turing machine and associated quantum circuits based on qubits and unitary elementary gates can be introduced and represent the standard , universal model of computation @xcite .",
    "+ it was shown in @xcite that @xmath1 csw functors at the fifth root of unity , whose domain is restricted to collections of ` topological ' qubits ( disks with three marked points ) on which suitable unitary representations of the braid groups @xmath28 and @xmath29 act , do reproduce the standard elementary gates of the quantum circuit model .",
    "the physical support of such information processing consists of anyonic systems obeying particular types of braid statistics , and work is in progress on the experimental side to check the implementability of such approach ( see @xcite and also @xcite for a different kind of implementation of braiding operators ) .",
    "+ based the above properties , a sort of ` minimal ' realization of the full quantum field computer is ( polynomially equivalent to ) the quantum circuit , and indeed the work of @xcite and @xcite on quantum computation of the jones invariant does not depend at all on any field theoretic background . generally speaking ,",
    "this is satisfactory for the aim of introducing an _ ad hoc _ computing model for treating anyonic quantum systems ; yet is somehow disturbing because classical turing machines and their probabilistic counterparts are able to simulate efficiently only any dynamical systems governed by classical laws at any degree of accuracy .",
    "even the objection that we are in the presence of a quantum field theory not simply a quantum mechanical many ",
    "body system is misleading since the csw model is exacly solvable at the full quantum level ( for each fixed value of the coupling constant ) without resorting to any approximation such as the low  energy limit @xcite .",
    "the crucial feature of possessing only global , purely topological degrees of freedom makes quantum csw theory likely to be simulated within a computational scheme based on a discrete space of states and able to implement polylocal braiding operations . + as will be illustrated in section 2 , the universal model of computation able to handle all discrete , many ",
    "body quantum systems described by ( real or virtual ) pure angular momenta states ( not simply two  level systems ) as well as solvable field theories of csw  type is the ( @xmath3deformed ) spin network proposed in @xcite .",
    "as already recognized in @xcite the task of computing the jones polynomial of a knot or link represents a major achievement since it is the simplest observable in quantum csw theory and then its calculation is a testing ground of the effectiveness of topological quantum computation .",
    "however , the interest in this algorithmic problem has recently grown in connection with the search for new testing grounds for quantum information theory in general , without necessarily exploiting the physical meaning of the invariant .",
    "the reason why jones link polynomial is so crucial in the computational context relies on the fact that a ` simpler ' link invariant , the alexander  conway polynomial , can be computed efficiently , while the problem of computing @xmath22variable polynomials such as the homfly invariant is @xmath30hard ( see @xcite for definitions of these invariants , original references and accounts of algorithmic questions ) .",
    "the issue of computational complexity of the @xmath31variable jones polynomial in classical information theory can be summarized in    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ + how hard is it to determine the jones polynomial @xmath32 of a link @xmath33 ?",

    "+ recall first that ` alternating ' links are special instances of links , the planar diagrams of which exhibit over and under crossings , alternatively .",
    "thus the evaluation of the invariant of generic , not only alternating links is at least as hard .",
    "secondly , the computation becomes feasible when the argument @xmath3 of the polynomial is a 2nd , 3rd , 4th , 6th root of unity , so that the first not easy case involves a 5th root of unity ( refer to @xcite for details on this technical issue ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath35 complexity class can be defined as the class of enumeration problems in which the structures that must be counted are recognizable in polynomial time . a problem @xmath36 in @xmath35 is said to be @xmath35complete if for any other problem @xmath37 in @xmath35 , @xmath37 is polynomial ",
    "time reducible to @xmath36 ; if a polynomial time algorithm were found for any such problem , it would follow that @xmath38 .",
    "a problem is @xmath35hard if some @xmath35complete problem is polynomial ",
    "time reducible to it .",
    "other instances of @xmath35complete problems are the counting of hamiltonian paths in a graph @xcite and the more intractable problems arising in statistical mechanics , such as the enumeration of all configurations contributing to ground state partition functions @xcite .",
