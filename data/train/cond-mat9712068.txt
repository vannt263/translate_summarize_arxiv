    "the ordering of oxygen ( o ) atoms in the basal plane of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 , and its relation with electronic properties , particularly the superconducting critical temperature @xmath9 , has been a subject of great interest .",
    "overviews are contained in ref .",
    "@xcite . by the end of the last decade , for @xmath1 near 0.5 evidence or ordering in chains was found , while for @xmath1 near 0 or 1 , hs were reported @xcite , the charge distribution in superconducting planes @xcite and in the cu ions of the basal planes @xcite was determined , and an explanation of these experiments was presented using a lattice - gas model based on coulomb repulsions , and the appropriate extension to this system of the three - band hubbard model @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "optical @xcite and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) @xcite experiments give strong evidence that two - fold coordinated cu atoms are in an oxidation state cu@xmath11 , while three- and four - fold coordinated cu atoms are cu@xmath12 .",
    "qualitatively , this fact is easy to understand in terms of @xmath10 @xcite : the energy necessary to add a @xmath13 hole to an @xmath14-fold coordinated cu@xmath11 ( surrounded by @xmath14 o@xmath15 ions ) is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the cu - o hole - hole repulsion .",
    "provided that the hole fermi energy of the superconducting cuo@xmath2 planes lies between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , only two - fold coordinated cu atoms remain cu@xmath11 , and the remaining holes go to the cuo@xmath2 planes ( and to o atoms of the chains ) .",
    "this mechanism not only provides the holes for superconductivity of the cs , but also reduces their energy @xcite . for @xmath20",
    ", annealing at room temperature produces an increase of @xmath9 due to an increase in the amount of two - fold coordinated cu ions @xcite .    in spite of this qualitative understanding of the relation between o ordering and charge transfer , and the success of lattice - gas models in explaining the basic features of the thermodynamics of o ordering at temperatures above room temperatures @xcite , a fully self - consistent theory of the atomic and electronic structure of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 is still lacking , and several controversial issues remain .",
    "_ showed that it is necessary to add electronic degrees of freedom to lattice - gas models in order to explain the observed @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the o chemical potential @xcite . the strong - coupling approaches to the electronic structure are able to treat adequately the on - site cu coulomb repulsion @xmath23 , and to explain the observed dependences of the hole count in the planes @xmath24 ( from which @xmath9 can be inferred @xcite ) , and the amount of cu@xmath11 @xcite . however , these agreements are obtained within a region of parameters of the model , which is not fully justified , and coulomb repulsions beyond @xmath25 are neglected . on the other hand , _ ab initio _ calculations , as a consequence of the large value of @xmath23 and the neglect of correlations , fail to describe the semiconducting phases ( they predict a metal ) and the neglected correlation energies are much larger than the lattice - gas model parameters which determine the structure @xcite .",
    "a controversial issue is the stability of hs .",
    "while it is clear that at room temperatures , the cs disappear in the semiconducting region @xcite , the experimental and theoretical situation does not allow at present to disclose unambiguously the nature of the ground state .",
    "the hs observed by transmission electron microscopy @xcite , were proposed to be metastable @xcite .",
    "synchrotron radiation studies for @xmath26 provided strong evidence of the presence of @xmath27 of a parasitic phase bacu@xmath3o@xmath28 @xcite , which is able to explain the x - ray diffraction pattern observed for @xmath29 , ascribed previously to o ordering @xcite .",
    "this pattern is also fully compatible with the superstructure of minimum coulomb repulsion between equally charged o atoms , among all those with unit cell @xmath30 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . on the other hand , neutron - scattering experiments for @xmath29 @xcite , which are more suitable to study o ordering due to the comparatively larger o cross section @xcite",
    ", are so far only explained in terms of an o ordered superstructure of unit cell @xmath31 @xcite . on the theoretical side , there is no general physical argument from which one can discard or confirm hs @xcite , except under too restrictive hypothesis @xcite , as we will show in section iii .",
    "the model which obtained these superstructures @xcite is based on coulomb repulsions between any two o ions , with metallic and dielectric screening and a parameter @xmath32 , which favors cs , to take into account the relation between charge transfer and cu coordination mentioned above @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 has been calculated using an extended hubbard model , but the result is too sensitive to the parameters of this model , not known with enough precision . for large but reasonable @xmath32 , the ground state of the structural model is a cs for any o content @xmath1 @xcite .    because of the very low or vanishing density of carriers , the madelung energy is a fundamental ingredient in the physics of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite and other @xcite high-@xmath9 systems . in yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ,",
    "o - o repulsions at distances of at least @xmath33 are necessary to explain observed split diffuse diffraction peaks @xcite , and o - o repulsions at distances @xmath34 are required to stabilize several of the observed cs @xcite . also , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on coulomb repulsions , seems to be able to explain qualitatively the experimental data gathered on yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite , including the structure transformation kinetics if supplemented by long - range elastic energies @xcite .",
    "here we generalize previous works considering the madelung energy , allowing for the possibility of charge transfer and finding the optimum distribution of charges by minimization of the total energy .",
    "effects of covalency are also included . neglecting the latter ,",
    "our approach is equivalent to the exact solution , in the limit of zero hopping and infinite on - site coulomb repulsions , of the appropriate model of the hubbard type for the system .",
    "the effect of correlations , essential for cu - o charge transfer @xcite is adequately retained .",
    "the main shortcomings of the approach are the neglect of core - core repulsive energy ( which amounts to @xmath35 of the madelung energy and stabilizes the lattice ) and screening effects .",
    "the theoretical treatment is presented in section ii .",
    "section iii contains the results and section iv is a discussion .",
    "the ground - state energy of the system per y atom is described as : @xmath36 @xmath37 is the madelung energy as a function of cu and o charges . @xmath38 is the energy required by the charge - transfer process cu@xmath11",
    "+ o@xmath39 @xmath40 cu@xmath12 + o@xmath15 in absence of interatomic repulsions .",
    "@xmath41 describes the kinetic and magnetic energy gain due to covalency in the superconducting cuo@xmath2 planes ( assumed equal for both planes of the unit cell ) , and @xmath42 is the corresponding term for the cuo@xmath43 subsystem containing the basal plane .",
    "the madelung energy can be written as @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the elementary charge , @xmath46 the number of y atoms in the supercell , @xmath47 the charge of the @xmath48 atom in the supercell , and @xmath49 the electrostatic potential at the position of this atom . because of charge neutrality @xmath50 , the geometrical coefficients @xmath51 can be shifted by an arbitrary constant .",
    "we have chosen it in such a way that @xmath52 for all @xmath53 . then for @xmath54 : @xmath55 here @xmath56 labels the translation vectors which map the superlattice onto itself and @xmath57 is the position of the @xmath58 atom of that supercell obtained from the one lying at the origin by a translation @xmath56 .",
    "the sum over @xmath56 is evaluated by the ewald s method @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we have assumed that the lattice parameters @xmath59 ( taking the average between them ) , and we have taken the positions of the atoms from three different o contents:@xmath60 @xcite , @xmath61 @xcite and @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "we also assume that all y ions are y@xmath63 , all ba ions are ba@xmath12 , all cu ions of the superconducting planes ( cu(2 ) in the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite ) have the same charge , and all o atoms of these planes ( denoted o(2 ) , o(3 ) @xcite ) related by translations of the primitive @xmath64 cell have the same charge .",
    "this simplifies considerably the problem , allowing us to express part of the sums in @xmath53 and @xmath65 of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , in terms of the coefficients @xmath66 of the primitive unit cell , reducing appreciably the number of @xmath67 s which should be calculated . neglecting an unimportant constant we can write : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the average charge of all cu atoms . in principle , @xmath70 is the difference between the ionization potential of cu@xmath11 and the ( negative ) electron affinity of o@xmath39 .",
    "however , it should also contain information of steric effects ( short - range repulsions ) , the energy gain of a _ local _ zhang - rice singlet @xcite ( not included in @xmath71 ) and the kinetic energy of the cu hole .",
    "we keep @xmath70 as a parameter , assumed independent of @xmath1 and determined in such a way that the charge distribution in yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath72 agrees with experiment .",
    "the number of added holes in one of the two superconducting planes per unit cell is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 are the average charges of the cu(2 ) , o(2 ) and o(3 ) atoms of that plane . for the kinetic energy as a function of @xmath75 , we take the form established from a high - temperature expansion of the @xmath5 model , with @xmath76=0.4 ev , @xmath77=0.1 ev @xcite , slightly generalized to give the correct magnetic energy for @xmath78 : @xmath79.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath80 represents the difference between the energy gain in forming a localized zhang - rice singlet in the planes with respect to forming it in perfect cuo@xmath3 linear systems ( involving the cu(1 ) , o(4 ) atoms of the basal plane , and two o(1 ) apical atoms @xcite )",
    ". it can also contain information of different steric effects in chains and planes .",
    "we keep @xmath80 as a parameter determined from the experimental charge distribution for @xmath6 .",
    "actually , a realistic one - band model for the cuprates contains also hoppings beyond nearest neighbors and three - site terms which determine the shape of the fermi surface and are critical for the superconductivity @xcite , but we expect that these terms do not affect @xmath41 very much .",
    "@xmath42 is obtained by fitting exact results for the one - dimensional @xmath5 model .",
    "the values @xmath81 ev , @xmath82 ev were determined from a low - energy reduction procedure which leads to excellent results for the optical conductivity of the chains @xcite .",
    "the result is @xcite : @xmath83y_1 - j y_2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the concentration of o(4 ) atoms belonging to perfect chains , @xmath85 is the concentration of isolated o(4)@xmath15 ions between two cu(1)@xmath12 ions , and @xmath86 is the number of holes per cu , added to ( cuo@xmath87 perfect chains .",
    "this expression does not take into account doped extremely short chains or the correction corresponding to chains of intermediate length .",
    "the total energy @xmath88 is minimized with respect to the charges in the subsystem cuo@xmath43 ( containing cu(1 ) , o(1 ) and o(4 ) atoms ) , and the average cu(2 ) , o(2 ) , o(3 ) charges on both superconducting planes .",
    "cu charges are allowed to vary between 1 and 2 , and o charges between -2 and -1 .",
    "this corresponds to the limit of very large on - site coulomb repulsions .",
    "first , we have applied our approach to stoichiometric yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath89 , a metallic state with a reasonably well - known , non trivial charge distribution .",
    "this is difficult to obtain from the madelung energy , because this concept was developed for insulators .",
    "in fact , if we neglect @xmath90 , we obtain that all cu ions are cu@xmath12 , and all o ions are o@xmath15 except the chain o(4 ) atoms , the oxidation state of which is -1 . in other words",
    "all holes go to the one - dimensional cu(1)-o(4 ) chains which are not expected to conduct ( due to defects or peierls distortions ) and the system is insulating .",
    "this is not bad as a first approximation .",
    "it is the best description of the observed charge distribution in terms of integer charges . including all terms in the energy , with @xmath91 ev and a reasonable @xmath92",
    "ev , we obtain that @xmath93 of the holes enter cuo chains and @xmath94 are in each of the superconducting cuo@xmath2 planes , in agreement with optical conductivity measurements @xcite , and estimations based on bond valence sums and other experiments @xcite .",
    "the resulting charges , madelung potentials @xmath49 and different contributions to the energy are included in table i.    after checking that in general this gives lower energy , and to simplify the algorithm , we have constrained the minimization procedure distributing the holes on both superconducting planes in equal amounts between the o(2 ) atoms of one plane and the o(3 ) of the other , and have kept -2 the charge of the apical o(1 ) ions . the results depend significantly , but not dramatically on @xmath80 : for @xmath80=0 , the amount of holes in each plane is reduced to @xmath95 . instead , the positions of the ba and apical o atoms are crucial .",
    "if the atomic positions are taken as those for @xmath62 , for which the o(1 ) atoms are nearer and the ba atoms more distant from the basal plane , we obtain a hole doping @xmath75 of only 0.03 in each cuo@xmath2 plane , while for the positions corresponding to @xmath61 , the resulting doping is 0.14 .    to establish bounds on @xmath70 , we have calculated next the energy and charge distribution of both superstructures shown in fig . 1 for @xmath96 .",
    "the hs is the one which minimizes the coulomb energy when all atoms related by symmetry operations of the tetragonal primitive unit cell have the same charge @xcite .",
    "however , the ground state is the cs , the two - fold ( four - fold ) coordinated cu ions are mainly cu@xmath11 ( cu@xmath12 ) @xcite , and about 0.1 holes per cu go to the superconducting cuo@xmath2 planes @xcite , in agreement with theory @xcite . to satisfy this charge distribution ,",
    "our model has to satisfy several constraints .",
    "one of them is @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the lowest @xmath49 of the occupied o atoms of the planes , and @xmath99 is the potential at the two - fold coordinated chain cu(1 ) atoms .",
    "if this constraint is not satisfied , the holes of the planes go to the two - fold coordinated cu atoms and the system would be insulating . in table",
    "ii we give the resulting charges , @xmath49 and energies of the cs for @xmath100 ev , slightly above @xmath101 . for larger values of @xmath70 (",
    "not too large to avoid that four - fold coordinated cu@xmath12 becomes cu@xmath11 ) , the only change is that @xmath88 and @xmath102 decrease proportionally to @xmath103 .",
    "the resulting amount of holes in each cuo@xmath2 plane ( 0.093 per cu ) is in very good agreement with experiment .",
    "the @xmath49 at inequivalent o(1 ) atoms are surprisingly similar and a little bit smaller than the @xmath49 of the o atoms of the cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "holes prefer the latter because of the positive value of @xmath80 .",
    "however a more realistic description should allow that a small amount of holes enter apical o(1 ) atoms , particularly for small @xmath80 .",
    "the experimental evidence indicates that three - fold coordinated cu(1 ) atoms are cu@xmath12 , in particular optical experiments on quenched samples @xcite , and nqr experiments in which y is replaced by larger ions @xcite .",
    "this is also suggested by the theoretical studies @xcite and the argument on the interplay between charge transfer and structure @xcite presented in section i. an upper bound on @xmath70 can be obtained requiring that in the hs for @xmath96 , all cu ions remain cu@xmath12 and no holes are transfered to the cuo@xmath2 planes , so that the system remains semiconducting .",
    "this implies @xmath104 .",
    "we obtain @xmath105 ev .",
    "it is interesting to note that in order for the present work to be consistent with the estimations of ohta _ et al .",
    "_ for the charge transfer gap in several high-@xmath9 superconductors @xcite one should take @xmath106 ev = 38.15 ev .",
    "the results for any @xmath107 are presented in table iii .",
    "comparison with the energy of the cs ( table ii ) , establishes a better lower bound for @xmath70 : in order for the cs to be the ground state , @xmath108 ev .    in the following ,",
    "we assume that @xmath92 ev and @xmath109 for all @xmath1 . using these criteria",
    "we derive conclusions regarding the stability of hs in comparison with cs .",
    "let us begin with @xmath110 , calculated with the atomic positions for @xmath62 @xcite . for cs ,",
    "all four - fold coordinated cu(1 ) ions remain cu@xmath12 , the two - fold coordinated ones are cu@xmath11 , and most of the holes apported by the neutral o atoms entering the @xmath62 structure to form that of @xmath110 , remain in their neighborhood : one hole is transfered to a nearest neighbor cu@xmath11 and only 0.09 additional holes per supercell are distributed in the planes . in other words",
    "the charge of the chain o(4 ) atoms is -1.090 and the doping of each superconducting plane is @xmath111 .",
    "the potential at the four - fold coordinated cu(1 ) atom in the supercell is -24.55 v , while those at two - fold coordinated cu(1 ) atoms vary between -13.24 v to -12.36 v , with increasing distance to the cu(1)-o(4 ) chain .",
    "the difference of more than 11 v is not taken into account in hubbard - type models which do not include a large nearest - neighbor cu - o repulsion @xmath17 in an appropriate way @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 at the chain o(4 ) atoms is 13.12 v. the @xmath49 at the cuo@xmath2 planes and apical o atoms have similar values as those reported in tables i and ii .    in the hs for @xmath110 ,",
    "all o ions are o@xmath15 and all three - fold coordinated cu(1 ) ions are cu@xmath12 .",
    "@xmath49 at these atoms is -23.82 v , while at the remaining , two - fold coordinated cu(1)@xmath11 ions , it is @xmath112v . at the o(4 )",
    "ions @xmath113 v and other @xmath49 are similar as those in table iii . for @xmath114",
    "ev , the total energy of the cs is -296.33 ev , slightly less than that of the hs ( -296.07 ev ) . although the madelung energy of the latter is less ( -272.57 ev in comparison with -268.63 ev of the cs ) , the cs has lower energy because it ionizes half of the cu(1)@xmath11 ions of the @xmath62 structure , and thus , pays less @xmath70 . for larger values of @xmath70 ,",
    "the difference increases linearly with @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the cs is the ground state for @xmath110 .    under some general conditions , using a multiband hubbard model including @xmath17 ,",
    "one of us has shown that hs - type superstructures have less energy in the semiconducting phase if no holes enter apical o(1 ) atoms @xcite .",
    "what is the reason of the discrepancy with the present result ?",
    "on one hand , the effect of repulsions beyond nearest neighbors is important .",
    "for example , in usual hubbard - type models , the energy necessary to add a hole in a chain o(4 ) atom with both nearest neighbors being cu@xmath12 is @xmath116 independently of the rest of the electronic and atomic structure .",
    "however , as explained above , this energy is 13.12 ev for the cs , and 5.28 ev larger for the hs . on the other hand , to obtain the present charge distribution of the cs with the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath117 is required , contrary to what is expected in cuo@xmath2 planes @xcite , and one of the hypothesis of ref . @xcite . as stated clearly in ref .",
    "@xcite , that calculation was aimed to discuss the effects of covalency neglecting repulsions beyond nearest - neighbor cu - o ones and assuming that these were small .",
    "however , we find that longer range repulsions are essential .",
    "next , we analyze the superstructures corresponding to @xmath118 with atomic positions taken from data for @xmath61 .",
    "the general trends of the charge distribution and potentials are similar to those of @xmath110 .",
    "two - fold coordinated cu(1 ) ions remain cu@xmath11 , while higher coordinated cu ions have an oxidation state cu@xmath12 . for cs , the charge of chain o(4 ) atoms is -1.37 and the doping per cu of the superconducting planes is @xmath119 .",
    "the potential at the sites of two o(4 ) atoms of the unit cell is 15.01 v and 16.12 v at the remaining o(4 ) sites .",
    "the @xmath49 at four - fold coordinated cu(1 ) sites are near -25 ev , and those at two - fold coordinated cu(1 ) sites vary between -11.45 v and -13.17 v. for the hs , all o ions are o@xmath15 , the @xmath49 at o(1 ) atoms is near 20.8 v , and those at four - fold ( two - fold ) coordinated cu(1 ) atoms are near -22 v ( -10.35 v ) .",
    "we should note that keeping this chargedistribution , there are at least two superstructures with less energy @xcite , one of them which provides the best fit of the neutron scattering data @xcite .",
    "the difference between the madelung energy of the superstructure of fig . 1 and the lowest lying of the above mentioned superstructures is 0.17 ev @xcite .",
    "including this correction , the energy of the lowest lying superstructure of unit cell multiple of @xmath30 for @xmath114 ev becomes -294.62 ev , only slightly smaller than the energy for the cs ( -294.56 ev ) .",
    "since increasing @xmath70 favors the cs by a term proportional to @xmath120 , there is a crossing already at @xmath121 ev and for @xmath122 = 38.29 ev , the cs has lower energy .",
    "if the @xmath118 superstructures are analyzed with atomic positions corresponding to @xmath62 instead of @xmath61 , the same trends are observed .",
    "@xmath123 increases slightly to 31.85 ev .",
    "the doping of the planes for cs is reduced to @xmath124 .",
    "the energy decreases in @xmath125 ev for both structures .",
    "this difference becomes significant when one considers the possibility of phase separation : the structures with @xmath118 calculated with the positions for @xmath62 ( @xmath61 ) @xcite are stable ( unstable ) against phase separation into phases with @xmath110 ( calculated with the positions for @xmath62 ) and @xmath96 ( calculated with the positions for @xmath61 ) .",
    "since we do not know exactly all atomic positions at the compositions of interest , we can not draw definite conclusions regarding phase separation .",
    "however , as pointed out earlier @xcite , the relaxation of the lattice is very important and favors phase separation .",
    "the last comparison between the two types of superstructures we make is for @xmath8 . since we do not include covalent corrections for cu(1)-o(4 ) chains of intermediate length present in the hs ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , we drop @xmath71 in this comparison . according to table i",
    ", the magnitude of the neglected terms is @xmath126 ev . as in previous cases , only two - fold coordinated cu ions are + 1 and the rest are cu@xmath12 . as a consequence of the neglect of covalency , all o atoms of cuo@xmath2 planes are o@xmath15 , and all chain o(4 )",
    "atoms are o@xmath39 , except one of the four o(4 ) atoms of the @xmath30 unit cell , nearest to the additional o(4 ) vacancy , which is o@xmath15 ( we have chosen it inside the short chain ) . for the cs , @xmath49 at two - fold",

    "@xmath49 at four - fold coordinated cu(1)@xmath12 ions is -23.10 v , except at the one nearest - neighbor to the o(4)@xmath15 , which amounts to -27.48 v. at the three - fold coordinated cu(1)@xmath12 ion nearest - neighbor to the o(4)@xmath15 ion , @xmath49 is also -23.10 v , and at the other three - fold coordinated cu(1)@xmath12 ion of the unit cell , @xmath127 v. at the o(4)@xmath15 ions is @xmath128 v. the potential at the other o(4 ) sites ( occupied by o@xmath129 ions ) vary between 12.42 v and 14.57 v.    the energy of the hs for @xmath8 is @xmath130 ev .",
    "this is less than the energy @xmath131 for the cs , even at the largest possible @xmath132 ev , for which @xmath133 ev . including @xmath71 this energy decreases to -292.92 ev , but in principle one expects a similar decrease for the hs . also for @xmath114 ev , even including @xmath71 , the energy of the cs is -291.85 ev , larger than that of the hs .",
    "we conclude that our model supports the latter as the ground - state superstructure .",
    "we have studied the interplay between the electronic and atomic structures of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 by a novel approach based on the madelung energy _ and _ the cost of the charge transfer process cu@xmath11 + o@xmath39 @xmath40 cu@xmath12 + o@xmath15 . the effect of covalency is included as a correction .",
    "this approach is motivated by the fact that while first - principles calculations fail to describe the semiconducting systems , and the correlation energy they neglect is near 0.6 ev and depends on the oxygen ordering @xcite , the strong - coupling models used so far @xcite neglect long - range repulsions and depend on parameters which are not well known .",
    "a particular difficulty of these hubbard - type models when applied to defects or systems with low symmetry ( as the @xmath134 or @xmath0 unit cells ) is that they require a large number of uncertain parameters ( on - site energies at sites non - equivalent by symmetry for example ) to describe the problem accurately enough .",
    "it is also difficult to include long - range repulsions in exact lanczos diagonalizations of hubbard like models .",
    "this was done by riera and dagotto for a generalized three - band hubbard model in one and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "however the two - dimensional results are incorrect due to subtleties in the use of boundary conditions , and in general different cluster sizes and shapes should be used @xcite .",
    "we addressed the issue of the stability of `` chain structures '' ( cs ) of unit cell @xmath135 ( @xmath14 integer ) in comparison with @xmath0 type of superstructures ( hs ) .",
    "as mentioned in section i , for @xmath136 and room temperatures , the experimental evidence is against cs .",
    "we mention here also photoconductivity experiments @xcite : illuminating semiconducting ( non cs ) films , the resistivity decreases strongly as a consequence of pumping holes to the superconducting cuo@xmath2 planes , and ordering in ( presumably short ) chains takes place @xcite since these structures are energetically favored under the constraint of a sizeable hole occupancy in the planes ( this can be inferred from the information on the different potentials given in the previous section , or the arguments given in refs .",
    "when illumination ceases , the resistivity returns to the original high values in times characteristic of oxygen diffusion ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , showing that the true equilibrium state is not a cs . nevertheless , it is still possible that at lower temperatures a phase transition takes place ( difficult to detect because of the sluggish oxygen kinetics at low temperatures ) , and the ground state is a cs .",
    "the present results support this statement .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that hs are favored by entropy at moderate temperatures : for cs , the cost in energy for a displacement of an o atom to their nearest available positions , breaking the chains , is high , while this is not the case for hs @xcite .",
    "in fact this entropy term is essential to explain the neutron - diffraction results for @xmath29 @xcite in terms of a @xmath137 superstructure @xcite .    the structural model of aligia , garcs and bonadeo @xcite",
    "is based on coulomb repulsions between any two basal - plane o(4 ) ions , screened by free carriers and dielectric polarization . except for high stabilization energy of the chains @xmath32 , cs",
    "are unstable within this model for @xmath138 because of the large cost in o - o coulomb energy required to arrange the o(4 ) atoms in cu(1)-o(4 ) chains .",
    "the present results show that the neglect of electronic screening in the semiconducting phase is incorrect : for @xmath110 and cs , the resulting o(4 ) charge ( @xmath139 ) , is screened by their nearest - neighbor cu(1)@xmath12 ions , and the cost in coulomb energy to build the cs is not so high . instead",
    ", we obtain that the cost of putting a line of o _ vacancies _ in the @xmath6 structure is not so efficiently screened and thus , for @xmath140 , cs are not favorable .",
    "other results which should be revised concern the hole count in the planes and the 60k plateau in the superconducting critical temperature @xcite .",
    "the present results suggest that the role of apical o(1 ) atoms is not so important as previously assumed @xcite , and that the positions of the atoms and relaxation of the lattice are crucial in the charge balance , and also in a possible separation in phases with different oxygen contents @xcite .    dielectric screening and that of free carriers , neglected in the present approach , are likely to play an essential role in the problem",
    ". one of the attempts to include madelung potentials in electronic calculations is that of ohta , tohyama and maekawa @xcite .",
    "the authors screened those potentials by the optical dielectric constant ( assumed 3.5 for all systems ) to obtain different parameters of a multiband hubbard model for the superconducting cu - based perovskites . using these parameters ,",
    "they have obtained charge - transfer gaps , exchange constants and other information in good agreement with experiment .",
    "one would be tempted to extend trivially this formalism to calculate the total energy of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 , dividing all madelung contributions by 3.5 .",
    "this is clearly incorrect , since dielectric and metallic screening should _ lower _ the total energy of the system ( increasing its absolute value ) with respect to the unscreened case , in spite of the fact that the magnitude of the effective interaction between two defect charges at a distance large in comparison with the interatomic distance , is reduced by dielectric or metallic screening @xcite .",
    "a simple electrostatic calculation involving two charges surrounded by a small void sphere ( to avoid divergences ) in a dielectric medium , shows that the interaction of the defect charges with the immediate neighborhood causes the largest reduction of the total energy .",
    "local distortions around added or vacant o(4 ) atoms in yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 were calculated by baetzold @xcite and are significant . in the semiconducting phase , for which the effect of free carriers can be neglected , a formalism which takes into account madelung energies , atomic potentials and atomic polarizations exists @xcite , and might be applied to yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 for @xmath136 , as an extension and improvement of the present approach .",
