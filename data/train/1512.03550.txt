    "a new vlbi array in east asia , the east - asian vlbi network ( eavn ) , is being planned under the collaboration of the east asia core observatory association ( eacoa ) .",
    "vlbi facilities are developing and operating in each east asian country , the chinese vlbi network ( cvn ; * ? ? ? * ) in china , the korean vlbi network ( kvn ; * ? ? ? * ) in korea , the japanese vlbi network ( jvn ; * ? ? ? * ) and vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ; * ? ? ? * ) in japan , and various international collaboration programs , such as the kvn and vera array ( kava ) , is ongoing by using those facilities . on the basis of this background ,",
    "a small task force ` the eavn tiger team ' was organized in june 2013 , consisting of 17 members from china , japan , and korea , to handle various issues related to eavn , such as promotion of vlbi test observations , clarification of the problems for future regular operation of eavn , and so on .",
    "the work of this task force is carried out as part of activities in ` the east asian vlbi consortium ' , which is one of working groups under the eacoa .",

    "the eavn can sample visibilities of a wide range of baseline lengths from 20  km ( jvn - tsukuba  jvn - kashima ) to 5,000  km ( cvn - nanshan  vera - ogasawara ) , allowing us to obtain a round - shaped synthesized beam with very low noise level thanks to a lot of large antennas , as shown in table  [ tbl : table1 ] .",
    "we have carried out test observations with the eavn eight times since 2013 at 8 and 22  ghz in order to get fringes between international baselines of the eavn , and to clarify the problems associating with the scheduling , correlation , and data reduction .",
    "16 telescopes have participated in fringe tests one or more times at either 8 or 22  ghz , or at both frequencies ( see table  [ tbl : table1 ] ) .    throughout those fringe tests",
    ", we could detect fringes at both frequencies .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure3 ] shows examples of fringe test results conducted on 2015 february 12 at 8  ghz .",
    "four telescopes , tsukuba ( jvn ) , ulsan ( kvn ) , sheshan and kunming ( cvn ) , participated in the observation , with a bright agn 3c  454.3 being a target source",
    ". fringes were successfully detected between all international baselines in china , japan , and korea .",
    "although discontinuous fringe phases and amplitudes can be seen between each if channel in the raw visibility , those are well - calibrated after fringe fitting and amplitude correction .",
    "discontinuous fringe phases appear in the international baselines between trans - cvn baselines ( i.e. , sheshan / kunming  tsukuba / ulsan baselines ) , although those can not be seen in the visibility of sheshan  kunming and tsukuba  ulsan baselines .",
    "this phenomenon is probably due to the different bit assignment in the backend system between cvn and kvn / jvn stations .",
    "this can be compensated by the correlator and good fringe phases and amplitudes can be obtained after fringe fitting and amplitude calibration , as shown in figure  [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "on the basis of the results obtained with eight - time fringe tests , we will start imaging test observations with the eavn from the end of 2015 .",
    "we conduct test observations at 8 and 22  ghz as a first step , whereas we will also begin both fringe tests and imaging observations from 2016 at 6.7 and 43  ghz , both of which are common observing frequencies and science commissioning observations have already been conducted with part of eavn telescopes , as mentioned in section  1 . as of this stage",
    ", we will begin to invite observing proposals for the eavn from the second half of 2017 .",
    "the fast telescope will have a capability of the data reception system at 70  mhz  3  ghz , while some of eavn telescopes have receivers at 1.6 and/or 2  ghz .",
    "the minimum sensitivity for 7-@xmath6 fringe detection of a few hundred mjy will be achieved at both 1.6 and 2  ghz between the fast and the usuda 64  m telescope of the jvn , assuming the antenna diameter of 300  m , the aperture efficiency of 20% , and the system noise temperature of 25  k for the fast , and the integration time of 60 seconds .",
    "the extremely high sensitivity allows us to investigate relatively weak radio sources such as low - luminosity agns , and to detect much more oh ( mega-)maser sources in galactic and extragalactic objects .    in the asia - pacific region , the long baseline array ( lba ) in australia has already been made regular operation , and collaborative work between the eavn and the lba has been made as a part of the framework in the asia - pacific telescope ( apt ) .",
    "the maximum baseline length of longer than 10,000  km can be obtained with the combined eavn and apt array in the north - south direction .",
    "this enable us to obtain better angular resolution and ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) coverage toward sources at low declination and southern sources . a new vlbi array project , the thai vlbi network ( tvn ) , is also in progress in thailand , and we are planning to pursue collaboration with both lba and tvn in the near future ,            li ,  j.  l. , guo ,  l. , & zhang ,  b.  2008 , in proc .",
