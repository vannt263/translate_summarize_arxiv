    "it has been well known that the _ quantum chromodynamics _ ( qcd ) is the first principle for the strongly interacting systems , consisting of quarks and gluons .",
    "recent energetic developments in heavy ion collisions ( hic ) , such as the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) , starts to shed the light on the new path for studying qcd . due to the nontrivial structure of the qcd vacuum",
    ", this fundamental theory enjoys the richness of the various phases , characterized by the relevant symmetries and invariances , and their breakdowns at finite temperature ( @xmath2 ) and/or density ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , studies on this qcd phase structure will reveal the profound understandings for the symmetries as well as qcd vacuum itself . in this sense ,",
    "the hot and dense qcd matter , i.e. _ quark gluon plasma _ ( qgp ) , believed to be created through the hic experiments , is the right place to investigate these interesting subjects in qcd .",
    "recently , among the various experimental and theoretical subjects in the hic experiments , the @xmath0 violation , indicated by the charge separation , has been attracting interest greatly  @xcite .",
    "this interesting phenomena is called the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) .",
    "microscopically , under the strong external magnetic field @xmath4 , generated through the peripheral hic , the cme can be interpreted as the induced electric current , due to the @xmath1 violation from the nontrivial qcd vacuum structure , indicted by the nonzero topological charge @xmath5 , according to the axial u(1 ) anomaly .",
    "hence , nonzero @xmath6 generates chirality inside the qcd matter . in this sense , observing the @xmath0 violation experimentally , one can find the signals for the @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 violations in the hic experiments .",
    "taking into account that the @xmath6 is also proportional to the number difference of the instantons and anti - instantons , @xmath7 , we are motivated to study the cme , employing the liquid - instanton model with nonzero @xmath8 .",
    "the magnetic field is included using the linear schwinger method  @xcite . to extend the model to a finite-@xmath2 system , we modify the model with the harrington - shepard caloron  @xcite and fermionic matsubara formula .",
    "we compute the cme current , its correlations , and charge separations as numerical results , and compare them with theory and experiment .",
    "this talk is based on our recent works  @xcite , and readers may find more details on this talk in them and references therein .",
    "the present report is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the theoretical formalism briefly .",
    "the analytical and numerical results are given in section iii with discussions .",
    "final section is devoted to summary and outlook .",
    "in order to study the cme and related quantities , we write the effective action , derived from the liquid - instanton vacuum with @xmath0 and @xmath1 violations  @xcite as follows : @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the quark four momentum @xmath12 and momentum - dependent constituent - quark mass , respectively . @xmath13 and @xmath14 stand for the strength of the @xmath1 violation , being proportional to the nontrivial topological charge @xmath6 , and external vector source field . detailed interpretations for deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : ea ] ) are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . using the effective action ,",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the electric current can be obtained by the functional differentiation of the @xmath15 with respect to the external vector source field @xmath16 in a standard way . in order to include the magnetic field ,",
    "which corresponds to that generated through the hic , we use the linear schwinger method  @xcite . to this end , we expand the quark propagator in the presence of the external electromagnetic ( em ) field . plugging this em field modified quark propagator into the cme currents , we then expand it with respect to the field strength tensor and collect the terms proportional to the magnetic field .",
    "being similarly to the cme current , their correlations can be easily derived using generic functional methods .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "all the physical quantities , cme current and correlations , are extended to those at finite @xmath2 . for this purpose ,",
    "we employ the harrington - shepard caloron  @xcite , which is a classical solution of the yang - mill s equation being periodic in the temporal direction . using this nontrivial solution",
    ", one can modify the instanton parameters , such as the average inter-(anti)instanton distances @xmath17 and their sizes @xmath18 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1n2 ] , we depict the instanton parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath18 as functions of @xmath2 ( left ) and the three - momentum and @xmath2 dependent constituent - quark mass @xmath11 ( right ) . as shown in the left panel , the instanton ensemble becomes diluting as @xmath2 increases . as a consequence ,",
    "the qaurk - instanton interaction is diminished as @xmath2 grows , resulting in decreasing constituent - quark mass as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1n2 ] . at the same time",
    ", it plays the role of the natural regulator , which tames the uv divergence appearing in the loop integrals .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     finally , we compute the same and opposite charge separations , which are the experimental observable suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , denoted by @xmath19 where @xmath20 indicate the angles for the measured hadrons with the electric charges @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cha ] ) stands for the correlation of the two hadron emissions , signaling the nontrivial event - by - event @xmath0 and @xmath1 violations  @xcite . as understood in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cha ] ) , this physical quantity relates to the sum of the longitudinal and transverse components for the disconnected correlations . although there are connected contributions , we ignored them due to thier smallness . tunning some model parameters ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) , we can present the numerical results for those quantities at @xmath24 mev in fig .",
    "we note that the present numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the size effect , i.e. the charge separations are proportional to @xmath25 , plays an important role to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "this observation indicates that the probability for finding the @xmath1-violating domain inside the qgp is proportional to @xmath25 .",

    "in this talk , we have reported the cme at the hic experiments , employing the @xmath2-modified instanton - liquid model , considering the harrington - shepard .",
    "we computed the cme current and its correlations , using the linear schwinger method to include the magnetic field in the present framework .",
    "all the numerical results are compared with the model - independent approaches and lqcd simulations for the cme , and show qualitatively good agreement . an important observation in the present work",
    "is that the cme gets decreased as @xmath2 increases , due to the diluting instanton ensemble .",
    "taking into account an appropriate magnetic potential configuration , screening effect , and size effect , we calculated the charge separations , which are the experimental observable measured by star collaboration at rhic .",
    "it turns out that the size effect , corresponding to the probability to find the @xmath1-violating domain inside the qgp , plays an important role to reproduce the experimental data .",
