    "among active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , blazars are the most extreme and powerful sources known and are believed to have their jets more aligned with the line of sight than any other class of radio loud agn .",
    "they are high luminosity objects , characterized by large , rapid , irregular amplitude variability in all accessible spectral bands .",
    "they have a core - dominated radio morphology with flat ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xmath2 0.5 ) radio spectra , which join smoothly to the infra - red ( ir ) , optical and ultra - violet spectra . in all of these bands",
    "the flux exhibits high and variable polarization .",
    "blazars are visible across the entire electromagnetic spectrum having a broad continuum extending from the radio through the gamma - ray regime .",
    "although much is known about the characteristics of their broadband emission , there are still many uncertainties about the underlying blazar emission mechanisms and many different models can explain their observed properties ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "their high variability and their broadband emission make long term , well - sampled , multiwavelength observations of blazars very important for constraining and understanding their emission mechanisms and characteristic timescales .",
    "when plotted as @xmath3f@xmath4 versus frequency , the blazar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) has a double - peaked structure .",
    "both peaks are found to vary , often both in strength and in peak frequency , as the activity level of the blazar changes .",
    "the first peak is usually referred to as the synchrotron peak because in both leptonic and hadronic models for blazar emission , it is believed generally to be the result of incoherent synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons , presumed to be present in the magnetic fields of the jet .",
    "the origin of the second peak , usually referred to as the inverse - compton peak , is less well determined . in synchrotron self - compton ( ssc )",
    "models it is assumed that the synchrotron photons are up - scattered to higher energies by the electrons while in external compton ( ec ) models , these seed photons can come from the accretion disk , the broad - line region , the torus , the local infrared background , the cosmic microwave background , the ambient photons from the central accretion flow or some combination of these sources .",
    "hadronic models have also been invoked to explain the broadband spectra of blazars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that the x - ray to gamma - ray emission is synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in highly magnetized compact regions of the jet .",
    "other authors propose that proton - proton collisions , either within the jet itself or between the jet and ambient clouds , give rise to neutral pions which then decay to gamma rays ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    as of this writing , 22 of the high - confidence sources in the rapidly growing catalog of very - high - energy ( vhe ; e @xmath5 100 gev )",
    "sources are agn .",
    "all but one of these , the fanaroff - riley type i galaxy m87 , are blazars . of the blazars ,",
    "one is a flat spectrum radio quasar , three are low - frequency - peaked bl lacs and the remainder are high - frequency - peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) .",
    "five of the tev blazars have been detected with the whipple 10 m gamma - ray telescope .",
    "the vhe emission from four of these blazars was first discovered at the whipple observatory , which has been in operation with an imaging camera from 1982 until the present day ( kildea et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , such as the whipple telescope , have sufficient sensitivity to sample the short - term variability of blazars .",
    "however , iact duty cycles are low ( @xmath6 10% ) because they can only operate on clear , moonless nights .",
    "typically , less than 1000 hours per year are available for observing and therefore , the observing programs are over - subscribed . in september 2005 , the first telescopes of the veritas array @xcite came on line and the observing program at the whipple telescope was redefined to dedicate it almost exclusively to nightly blazar monitoring . since that time , markarian 421 , h1426 + 428 , markarian 501 , 1es1959 + 650 and 1es2344 + 514 have been monitored routinely each night that they are visible ( dark clear skies , elevation @xmath5 55@xmath7 , when possible ) . for the first time , this has provided the opportunity to obtain long - term and well - sampled vhe light - curves of these highly variable objects .",
    "part of the motivation for these observations was to provide a trigger for more sensitive vhe observations of these agn by the new generation of iact telescopes ( cangaroo - iii , hess , magic and veritas ) and to provide baseline observations for similar observations with glast .",
    "the results of the monitoring campaign on markarian421 ( mrk421 ; 1101 + 384 ) are described here . at a redshift of @xmath8=0.031",
    ", mrk421 was the first source of vhe gamma rays to be discovered @xcite . since that pivotal discovery",
    ", mrk421 has been studied extensively in the vhe band and many periods of intense variability have been observed .",
    "mrk421 is the archetypal hbl .",
    "historically , it has exhibited shifts in both the peak frequency and in the power of the first and second components of the sed @xcite . in april 2001",
    ", mrk421 entered an extremely active phase .",
    "it was observed intensively with the whipple 10 m telescope during this time and , for the first time in a hbl , the spectrum in the vhe regime was found to harden as the flux of vhe gamma rays increased ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "often , for multiwavelength ( mwl ) campaigns in which vhe telescopes participate , the call for full multiwavelength coverage is invoked when large flares are observed in the tev band ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . like the observations described here",
    ", the campaign carried out by @xcite in 2003 - 2004 was not instigated due to flaring activity from mrk421 .",
    "that campaign , which concentrated mainly on the x - ray and gamma - ray data , revealed the correlation between the emission in the two wavebands to be fairly loose .",
    "rapid variability was detected in both wavebands , and the x - ray emission was found to peak days after the gamma - ray emission for one giant flare .",
    "evidence for tev orphan flaring , similar to that found in 1es1959 + 650 by @xcite , was also seen .",
    "in addition to significant x - ray and gamma - ray coverage , the dataset described here includes excellent coverage of mrk421 in the optical and radio bands .    to encourage and coordinate observations of the target agn at other wavelengths ,",
    "a web page containing the observing timetable and the preliminary light curves at tev wavelengths was made publicly accessible and continuously maintained via the whipple link on the veritas webpages : http://veritas.sao.arizona.edu .",
    "emails were distributed throughout 2005 - 2006 to coordinate the mrk421 observations .",
    "data from twelve different wavebands , spanning more than 18 orders of magnitude in energy , were obtained over a period of approximately 230 days . because this campaign was not triggered by activity at any wavelength",
    ", there were no _ a priori _ assumptions about flux levels and we can look for correlations on longer timescales and under different source conditions .",
    "since these mrk421 data were gathered over a long period of time and , in the case of some wavebands , from a number of different instruments for a particular energy range , it was important to ensure that the data were well - calibrated so that the variability of mrk421 over the course of the campaign was not contaminated by inaccurate intra - night and/or intra - telescope normalizations .    in section  [ observation ]",
    "we describe the observations presented in this paper .",
    "this section is subdivided by wavelength band . in section",
    "[ results ] the results of the observations are presented while in section  [ discussionandconclusion ] we discuss the implications of these results in the context of emission models .",
    "the complete dataset presented in this paper is summarized in table  [ tab : all ] and the lightcurves are shown together in figure  [ fig : entire - dataset ] . in the following section , the data collection procedures and the mrk421 data gathered at each of the instruments are described .",
    "all the tev gamma - ray observations presented here were made with the 10 m gamma - ray telescope at the fred lawrence whipple observatory @xcite .",
    "although sensitive in the energy range from 200gev to 20tev , the peak response energy of the telescope to a crab - like spectrum during the observations reported upon here was approximately 400gev .",
    "this is the energy at which the telescope is most efficient at detecting gamma rays and , as is typical for iacts such as whipple , is subject to a 20% uncertainty .",
    "the mrk421 data were analyzed using the imaging technique and analysis procedures developed by the whipple collaboration ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a quicklook analysis was performed at the conclusion of each observation and the results were posted daily on a public web page .",
    "three offline analyses ( independent but using the standard supercuts methodology ) were used to derive the tev light - curves presented here .",
    "two different modes of observation are employed at the whipple telescope , `` _ on - off _ '' and `` _ tracking _ '' @xcite . in both modes ,",
    "the data are usually taken in 28-minute scans . unlike data taken in the _ on - off _ mode , the scans taken in",
    "the _ tracking _",
    "mode do not have independent control data which can be used to establish the background level of gamma - ray like events during the scan .",
    "these control data are essential in order to estimate the number of events passing all cuts that would have been detected during the scan in the absence of the candidate gamma - ray source . in order to perform this estimate ,",
    "a tracking ratio is calculated by analyzing `` darkfield data '' @xcite . these consist of _ off - source _ data taken in the _ on - off _ mode and of observations of objects found not to be sources of gamma rays .",
    "a large database of these scans is analyzed and , in this way , the background level of events passing all gamma - ray selection criteria can be characterized as a function of zenith angle .",
    "the data presented here were mostly taken in the _ tracking _ mode .    during the period mjd 53676",
    "to mjd 53908 , a total of 144.1 hours of data were taken on mrk421 .",
    "since iacts can only operate during moonless conditions , there is a period centered on full moon each month when gamma - ray observations are not possible . from the total of 328 runs on the source ( _ on",
    "_ and _ tracking _ modes ) , 275 runs ( 84% ) , comprising 122.57 hours , survived the quality selection process .",
    "apart from any problems reported by observers in the nightly logs , the main parameter used to determine whether the data run should be included in the final analysis was the stability of the raw trigger rate .",
    "any data run whose raw trigger rate deviated significantly from being steady for its duration was discarded .    when possible , the agn data were interspersed with observations of the crab nebula , the standard candle in this energy regime .",
    "a total of 44.41 hours of these were taken and subjected to the same analysis procedure .",
    "in addition , nightly runs were taken with the telescope pointing to the zenith ; these data were used to calculate the telescope throughput @xcite so that data could be corrected for inter - nightly changes in atmospheric transparency .",
    "both the agn and the crab data were corrected for variations in the throughput .",
    "in addition to this , a correction was applied to compensate for elevation effects in the data due to the increasing volume of atmosphere through which the cherenkov light propagates as the zenith angle of the observations increases .",
    "these corrections ensured that data taken on different nights , under different atmospheric conditions and at different elevations could be compared .",
    "the mrk421 rates were then converted into equivalent crab rates .",
    "it should be noted that this simplistic scaling is strictly only valid for a tev spectrum near that of the crab nebula ( spectral index of -2.6 ) .",
    "although mrk421 has been known to display spectral variability in the past , the measurement uncertainties on the flux points are such that the effect of spectral variability should not be significant .",
    "the gamma - ray lightcurve containing the rate from each approximately 28-minute scan on mrk421 is shown in figure  [ fig : gamma ] .      the x - ray data for this multiwavelength campaign span the energy range from 0.2 to 50 kev .",
    "these data come from four different instruments , two on the rossi x - ray timing explorer and two on the swift satellite .",
    "the x - ray lightcurves are shown together with the gamma - ray data in figure  [ fig : x - gamma ] .",
    "the details of the analysis of each x - ray dataset are given in the following subsections .",
    "the all - sky monitor ( asm ) , on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) @xcite operates in the 1.5 to 12 kev energy band and scans most of the sky every 1.5 hours .",
    "it consists of three coded aperture cameras , scanning shadow cameras , which can be rotated to view different regions of the sky @xcite .",
    "each scanning shadow camera is a sealed proportional counter filled with a xenon - co@xmath9 mixture .",
    "the data presented here are the one - day averages from the asm quicklook pages .",
    "each one - day average data point represents the one - day average of the fitted source fluxes from a number ( typically 5 to 10 ) of individual asm dwells .",
    "a total of 256 nights of asm data on mrk421 are presented here from mjd 53670 - mjd 53930 . during this time , the mean nightly flux from mrk421 in the 2 - 10 kev band was 1.99 counts s@xmath10 .      the primary instrument on board nasa s x - ray satellite rxte is the proportional counter array ( pca ) .",
    "it is an array of five proportional counters with a total net area of 6250 @xmath11 and is effective over the energy range 2 to 60 kev .",
    "mrk421 was observed with the rxte pca from mjd 53741 to mjd 53887 in short daily exposures ranging from 2.1 to 48.0 minutes , with a mean exposure of 19 minutes .",
    "the pca exposures were scheduled to coincide with the whipple 10 m telescope observations , so that the data gaps of @xmath12 12 days in the x - ray database coincide with the bright moon periods when no gamma - ray observations were possible . due to various observing constraints ,",
    "the x - ray and gamma - ray observations were not always simultaneous , with the pca observations starting on average 99 minutes behind the whipple 10 m observations .",
    "data analysis was carried out with the heasoft 6.1 tools and current calibration files , following the standard procedure .",
    "the version number is consistent with the swift analysis .",
    "the pca data presented here comprise 75 exposures from mjd 53741 to mjd 53887 with a mean flux of 5.18 x 10@xmath13 erg @xmath14 s@xmath10 .      the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , one of the instruments on the swift satellite @xcite , is a focusing x - ray telescope with a 110 @xmath11 effective area and a 23 arcmin field of view @xcite .",
    "it is sensitive to x - rays in the 0.2 to 10 kev band .",
    "the xrt data presented here were reduced using the latest heasoft tools ( version 6.1.0 ) , including swift software version 2.0 , and the latest response ( version 8) and ancillary response files ( created using xrtmkarf ) available in caldb at the time of analysis .",
    "data were screened with the standard parameters , including the elimination of time periods when the ccd temperature was warmer than -48@xmath7 c. due to the high rates of mrk421 during the xrt observations , only windowed timing ( wt ) mode data were used in this analysis , and only grades 0 - 2 were included .",
    "since the count rate stayed below @xmath12100 c / s , the wt mode data is free of significant pile - up effects . the data were corrected for effects due to bad columns and bad pixels . source and background regions were both chosen in a way that avoids overlap with serendipitous sources in the image .",
    "for the analysis presented here , data from the xrt were summed in one - day bins resulting in a total of 24 measurements from mjd 53737 to mjd 53913 . as can be seen in figure  [ fig :",
    "x - gamma ] , the xrt lightcurve is the most sparsely sampled of the x - ray lightcurves . during all xrt observations reported on here however ,",
    "mrk421 was detected above 5@xmath15 .",
    "the mean flux from mrk421 during these xrt observations in the energy range from 0.2 to 10 kev was 47.23 counts sec@xmath10 .",
    "the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) , also on swift , is a large field of view ( 1.4 steradian ) x - ray telescope with imaging capabilities in the energy range from 15 to 150 kev .",
    "it has a coded aperture mask with 0.52m@xmath16 cdznte detectors .",
    "the bat typically observes 50% to 80% of the sky each day and has accumulated light curves for 530 non - grb sources @xcite .",
    "the bat data shown here are the swift / bat transient monitor results provided by the swift / bat team @xcite and span the energy range from 15 to 50 kev . as part of its on - board grb monitor , the bat flight software produces `` scaled maps '' in the energy band 15 to 50 kev and on timescales @xmath17 64 seconds .",
    "the data were first verified to ensure that any corrupted or incomplete data were rejected .",
    "then , they were analyzed using the standard bat software tools .",
    "full details of this analysis are given at the bat transients webpage @xcite .",
    "bat data are available for 240 nights during this multiwavelength campaign .",
    "when these were filtered to remove data that were flagged as bad , 234 nights remained .",
    "these data were taken between mjd 53670 and mjd 53930 and , during this time , the mean flux from mrk421 recorded by the bat in the energy range from 15 to 50 kev was 2.72 x 10@xmath18 count sec@xmath10 .",
    "eight optical observatories contributed data sets to this campaign .",
    "they are the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.2 m telescope ( located adjacent to the whipple 10 m gamma - ray telescope on mt .",
    "hopkins ) , the tenagra 0.8 m telescope in tenagra , arizona , usa , the bradford robotic telescope in tenerife , canary islands , spain , the wiyn 0.9 m telescope on kitt peak , arizona , usa , the 0.7 m telescope at abastumani observatory in abastumani , georgia , the 0.6 m bell observatory at western kentucky university , usa , bordeaux observatory in floriac , france , and the 1.05 m reosc telescope at osservatorio astronomico di torino , italy .",
    "table [ tab : optical ] gives a brief description of each telescope , its filter system and bandpass , and its contribution to the optical dataset .",
    "the data from the various observatories were reduced and the photometry performed independently by different analysts using different strategies .",
    "the flwo , bradford , and tenagra data , for example , usually consisted of a single or a few images per filter per night .",
    "relative aperture photometry was performed using standard routines in iraf .",
    "magnitudes were calculated with respect to star 1 of villata @xcite with a photometry aperture of 10 arcsec .",
    "the host galaxy light was not subtracted at this stage of the analysis .",
    "other optical analysts used slightly different strategies : the photometry for the bell , wiyn and abastumani data were quoted with respect to stars 1 - 3 of villata , and the torino photometry was performed using gaussian fitting rather than by counting within a fixed aperture .    combining the various optical data to produce a composite lightcurve for each spectral band",
    "is complicated by the fact that different observatories use different photometric systems .",
    "furthermore , photometric apertures and the definition of the reported measurement error for each nightly - averaged flux is inconsistent across datasets .",
    "therefore we have adopted a simple approach for the construction of the composite lightcurves whereby a unique flux offset is found for each spectral band of every instrument based on overlapping observations @xcite .    in the r - band , for example , we first find the initial average flux offset for each r - band lightcurve with respect to that of the flwo ( since it spans the largest range of dates ) based on observations overlapping by less than 0.8 days ( except for the bell and torino lightcurves , whose coincidence windows were widened to 1.8 days to ensure a sufficient number of overlaps ) .",
    "then , for each lightcurve , a comparison lightcurve is constructed using the lightcurves from the other observatories with the initial flux offsets applied .",
    "a new offset is then found for each lightcurve based on overlapping observations in the respective comparison lightcurve . the process is repeated iteratively until the variance of the offset residuals for each lightcurve is minimized .",
    "the final composite lightcurve for each spectral band is then made by simply combining the nightly - averaged flux from each observatory with the final offsets applied and these are shown in figure  [ fig : optical ] .",
    "of the three wavelengths , the r - band is the best - sampled , comprising 166 data points on 97 nights spanning a period of 260 days .",
    "figure  [ fig : opt - gamma - lightcurves ] shows the very well - sampled optical lightcurves , after all the data from different instruments have been combined and normalized , along with the gamma - ray data during this campaign .",
    "the mean magnitude of mrk421 during this campaign was 12.95 in the r - band , 13.40 in the v - band and 13.82 in the b - band .      typically , the variations in agn are slower at radio frequencies than at the higher frequency bands with the most variability being observed at the higher radio frequencies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in general , because of this slower long - term variability , agn are not observed with as high temporal coverage in this regime .",
    "the radio data presented here were taken at eight frequencies at three different radio observatories but , for four of these frequency bands the radio coverage was very sparse .",
    "the fluxes and their associated standard errors are given in janskys , so they have already been normalized for the bandwidth of their receivers .",
    "generally , mrk421 is found to vary on monthly timescales .",
    "the radio lightcurves are shown along with the gamma - ray lightcurve in figure  [ fig : radio ] . in the subsections that follow , the radio data and analysis from the participating observatories",
    "are described .",
    "the 37 ghz observations were made with the 13.7 m diameter metshovi radio telescope , which is a radome enclosed paraboloid antenna situated in finland ( 24 23 38e , + 60 13 05  ) .",
    "the measurements were made with a 1 ghz - band dual beam receiver centered at 36.8 ghz .",
    "the hempt ( high electron mobility pseudomorphic transistor ) front end operates at room temperature .",
    "the observations are on  on observations , alternating the source and the sky in each feed horn .",
    "a typical integration time to obtain one flux density data point is 12001400 s. the detection limit of the telescope at 37 ghz is on the order of 0.2 jy under optimal conditions .",
    "data points with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath19 4 are handled as non - detections .",
    "the flux density scale is set by observations of dr 21 .",
    "sources 3c84 and 3c274 are used as secondary calibrators .",
    "a detailed description on the data reduction and analysis is given in @xcite .",
    "the error estimate in the flux density includes the contribution from the measurement rms and the uncertainty of the absolute calibration .",
    "most of the data at 4.8 , 8.0 and 14.5 ghz came from the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) using the 26 m diameter parabolic reflector . both on - source and background flux measurements were performed . to provide improved sensitivity , the receivers have relatively broad bandwidth of 500 , 780 and 2000 mhz at the three frequencies respectively .",
    "the adopted flux density scale is based upon the flux of cassiopeia a , the primary flux calibrator , using its measured decay rate at centimeter wavelengths . a grid of secondary flux calibrators distributed in ra are also observed . in order to correct for environmental variations ,",
    "a calibration source was observed approximately every 1 - 2 hours .",
    "the integration times at umrao are typically 30 minutes and measurements are usually taken within @xmath202.5 hours of the meridian .      the 122  ghz instantaneous radio spectrum of mrk421 was observed with the 600-meter ring radio telescope ratan-600 @xcite of the special astrophysical observatory , russian academy of sciences , located in zelenchukskaya , russia , on march 26 , 27 , & 28 , and may 3 & 4 , 2006 .",
    "the continuum spectrum was measured every time quasi - simultaneously ( within several minutes ) in a transit mode at six different bands with the following central frequencies ( and bandwidths ) : 0.95  ghz ( 0.03  ghz ) , 2.3  ghz ( 0.25  ghz ) , 4.8  ghz ( 0.6  ghz ) , 7.7  ghz ( 1.0  ghz ) , 11.2  ghz ( 1.4  ghz ) , 21.7  ghz ( 2.5  ghz ) .",
    "details on the method of observation , data processing , and amplitude calibration are described in @xcite .",
    "the march data were collected using the northern sector of the telescope while the june spectrum was observed at the southern sector with the flat reflector . since",
    "no significant time variations were found during three days in march and two days in may , two averaged ratan total flux density spectra for march and may 2006 are provided and used in this paper .",
    "in addition to these radio lightcurves , the data from the 2 cm vlba / mojave monitoring program ( @xcite ; @xcite ) for the epoch 05april2006 ( mjd53830 ) were used ( see the 15ghz vlba image in figure  [ fig : vlbi ] ) . the total flux density ( stokes i ) at 15 ghz",
    "integrated over this image is 336 mjy .",
    "the flux density from the core region , when it is modeled using a circular gaussian , is 288 mjy so mrk421 was very core dominated at this time implying that the bulk of the radio - band variability is associated with the vlbi - imaged core .",
    "the angular size of the modeled core on the half power level is 0.046 milliarcseconds .",
    "the core size resolution limit was estimated for this dataset following @xcite and appeared to be less than the measured core size value .",
    "the linearly polarized flux density is 6 mjy .",
    "this polarized flux is detected from the core region only .",
    "vlbi core brightness temperature in the source frame is estimated to be 8@xmath2110@xmath22  k.",
    "the large , well - sampled multiwavelength lightcurves collected on mrk421 during 2005 - 2006 enabled us to carry out a number of different analyses , which are described in the following subsections .",
    "the variability across the entire spectrum was investigated by computing both the fractional rms variability amplitude and the point - to - point fractional variability amplitude for each of the twelve wavebands . for the better - sampled lightcurves , namely those in the optical , x - ray and gamma - ray wavebands , a more detailed variability analysis was undertaken .",
    "correlations were sought between the emission at different energies and the discrete correlation function was computed for the optical - gamma and the x - ray - gamma datasets .",
    "three different nights were chosen , when mrk421 was deemed to be in a high , medium and low emission state , and broadband spectral energy distributions were constructed for each of these nights .",
    "the high - flux spectral energy distribution was compared with those from archival mrk421 observations .      the fractional rms variability amplitude , f@xmath23 and the point - to - point fractional rms variability amplitude , f@xmath24 , @xcite were calculated for each of the energy bands where a significant amount of data was gathered .",
    "they are defined as :    @xmath25    and    @xmath26    where each flux measurement f@xmath27 has a measurement error @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the arithmetic mean of the counts and :    @xmath30    and @xmath31 is the mean error squared :    @xmath32    these quantities were calculated using one - day binning for each of the data sets . these results can be seen for all wavebands apart from the 37ghz radio dataset in table  [ tab : fvar - fpp ] . for the 37ghz data ,",
    "the difference between the terms to be subtracted in both equations  [ eq : fvar ] and  [ eq : fpp ] was negative , indicating that the measurement errors were larger than the variability observed , and therefore the calculation could not be completed .",
    "the fractional rms variability amplitude , f@xmath23 quantifies the integrated level of variability present in a particular waveband while the point - to - point fractional rms variability amplitude , f@xmath24 , probes the short - timescale variability by measuring the variations between adjacent points in the lightcurve .",
    "their ratio , taken as a function of energy , provides information on the dependence of the power spectral density slope on energy @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fvar ] shows f@xmath23 and the ratio of f@xmath23 to f@xmath24 for ten of the twelve wavebands .",
    "the values for the bat data are not plotted because , as will be discussed in section  [ discussionandconclusion ] , the significance level of the bat detection was less than 3 sigma on most nights ( @xmath6 58% ) during this campaign .      throughout the observations presented here ,",

    "mrk421 was observed by the tactic gamma - ray telescope @xcite during a time period overlapping with these whipple observations and , although the energy ranges and sensitivities of the two instruments are slightly different , similar overall trends are present in the two datasets . the maximum gamma - ray rate for one of the whipple 28-minute exposures occurred on mjd 53733 when a rate of 4.38 @xmath20 0.49 crab was recorded .",

    "which is not as well sampled as those in the other wavebands , evidence for heightened emission over a period of two nights was seen from mjd 53739 to 53740 .",

    "the well - sampled optical lightcurves show evidence for variability during this campaign .",
    "the mean magnitudes for each band are shown in table  [ tab : fvar - fpp ] .",
    "when converted to linear fluxes , the optical flux was found to peak at 1.43 times its mean value in both the r - band and the v - band and to peak at 1.83 its mean flux in the b - band .",
    "several r - band flare features with amplitudes of @xmath38 mag are resolved in the particularly well - sampled range of dates spanning 53800 @xmath19 mjd @xmath19 53900 .",
    "the fractional rms variability amplitude and point - to - point fractional rms variability amplitude are 0.13 and 0.04 respectively for the r - band lightcurve , 0.14 and 0.05 respectively for the v - band lightcurve and 0.19 and 0.06 respectively for the b - band lightcurve . in all cases , the ratio of f@xmath23 to f@xmath24 is @xmath6 3 , indicating that , like the gamma - ray and x - ray bands , red - noise processes are responsible for the optical variability .",
    "the measured optical flux includes contributions from the host galaxy , estimated to be @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "since it affects only the mean flux , not the variability , the optical fractional rms variability amplitude should be about @xmath40 higher .",
    "the level of optical variability seen in this analysis is slightly lower but is consistent with the level of variability seen in other recent multiwavelength studies of this source @xcite .",
    "variations in flux among the three optical bands are highly correlated .",
    "there is weak evidence in this data set supporting a trend of flattening of the optical spectrum with increasing r - band flux : a trend seen more definitively by other authors in the long - term lightcurves of mrk421 and other bl lac objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior , predicted by several authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , is consistent with the expected spectral variability behavior of a jet with emission dominated by the ssc processes .",
    "the normalized , first - order structure function of the composite r - band lightcurve has been computed and is shown in figure [ fig : sfs - opt ] .",
    "the structure function rises approximately linearly at short timescales up to a time - lag of between about 40 and 60 days where a clear break is seen , above which the structure function rises linearly again .",
    "the break most likely indicates a characteristic timescale of shot - like emission events .",
    "we note that structure functions with similarly - shaped breaks have been observed in other wavebands with different characteristic break frequencies , for example , the euv emission from mrk421 recorded by the extreme ultraviolet explorer during a 1998 multiwavelength campaign @xcite .",
    "this is the waveband in which the lightcurves are least - sampled and also , the waveband in which the least amount of variability is seen .",
    "this is typical for blazars ; the variations observed in the radio regime tend to occur over longer timescales than those at shorter wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the lowest values of the fractional rms variability amplitude , 0.04 to 0.27 , were found for the radio data .",
    "the fact that these data were less well - sampled than the data at other frequencies would most likely lead to an underestimation of f@xmath23 in this waveband .",
    "the ratio of f@xmath23 to f@xmath24 for each of the four radio bands plotted in figure  [ fig : fvar ] is found to be @xmath6 1 , indicative of white - noise variability .",
    "all of the x - ray data taken during this campaign are plotted with the gamma - ray data in figure  [ fig : x - gamma ] . for this plot ,",
    "the xrt and pca data are plotted between 210kev , their counts having been converted to fluxes using a log - parabolic model to fit the data .",
    "the length of the exposure acquired varies from night to night , even for a single instrument .",
    "there is evidence for correlated variability throughout the campaign , in particular around the period of mjd 53875 to 53885 .",
    "the mean rate over the entire observing campaign for each waveband is plotted as a horizontal , solid red line on these plots .",
    "the data can be seen to follow similar trend in terms of their mean flux level .",
    "figure  [ fig : x - gamma - correlation ] shows flux - flux diagrams ( for 1-day timescales ) for each x - ray band with the gamma - ray data .",
    "each dataset was first normalized by dividing each flux point by the mean flux in that waveband so that the flux - flux correlations between the gamma - ray data and each x - ray band could be more easily compared . using a weighted total least - squares algorithm @xcite , which took into account uncertainties in the x - ray and the gamma - ray data , a straight line was fitted to each of the flux - flux plots .",
    "the slopes these lines are found to increase with x - ray energy and are 0.73 , 1.00 , 1.51 and 3.01 for the xrt , asm , pca and bat data respectively .",
    "as would be expected due to their overlap in energy range , the slopes of the flux - flux relations between the gamma - ray and the xrt ( 0.2 - 10kev ) , asm ( 2 - 10kev ) and pca ( 3 - 25kev ) data are quite close to each other , their differences presumably arising due to the slightly different energy ranges and measurement uncertainties .",
    "although the lower energy x - ray data ( i.e. not those from the bat ) and gamma - ray data do look somewhat correlated , there are outliers on all plots . in general , the gamma - ray and the lower - energy x - ray data exhibit low and high fluxes at similar times . to compare the relationship between these x - ray and gamma - ray data with that derived by @xcite , the data were re - plotted on a log - scale , with the gamma - ray data on the y - axis ( figure  [ fig : x - gamma - log - correlation ] ) .",
    "the slopes of the lines were found to be 1.03 for the xrt ( 0.2 - 10 kev ) , 0.98 for the asm ( 2 - 10 kev ) , 0.48 for the pca ( 3 - 25 kev ) and 0.22 for the bat ( 15 - 50 kev ) data . in the energy range between 2 and 10 kev , @xcite found a slope of 0.88 , similar to that found here in that energy range , for the relationship between the pca and gamma - ray data from mrk421 . when only the significant detections ( defined here as @xmath53@xmath41 and highlighted in green on figure  [ fig : x - gamma - log - correlation ] ) were included in the slope calculation , the higher - flux data remained and the slopes of the xrt , asm and pca data decreased slightly to 0.94 , 0.78 and 0.33 respectively while the relationship between the bat and the gamma - ray data became inverted ( slope of -0.18 ) , with little evidence for correlation between the two bands .",
    "flux - flux diagrams were also made for weekly and monthly timescales .",
    "the asm data in particular were found to show evidence for correlated emission with the gamma - ray data on weekly and on monthly timescales as shown in figure  [ fig : x - gamma - asm ] .",
    "the slopes of the lines are 1.0 , 1.0 and 0.5 for the daily , weekly and monthly lightcurves respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : x - gamma - fluxovermean ] shows the flux divided by the mean flux in that band for each of the x - ray datasets and for the gamma - ray data .",
    "a high degree of correlation can be seen , in particular between the gamma - ray data and those from the asm and the pca .",
    "we searched for correlations between fluxes in the x - ray bands and the gamma - ray band using the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) .",
    "the dcf , introduced by @xcite , is an approximation to the classical correlation function which is applicable to discrete time - series .",
    "it gives the linear correlation coefficient ( @xmath42 ) for two light curves as a function of the time lag between them .",
    "the dcf is well - suited to sparsely - sampled lightcurves and is less likely to give rise to spurious results than a traditional correlation analysis with interpolated light curves . to construct the dcf",
    ", we first collect the set of unbinned discrete correlations , udcf@xmath43 :    @xmath44    for all pairs of observations a@xmath27 , b@xmath45 , with measurement errors @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and mean measurement errors of e@xmath48 , e@xmath49 , respectively .",
    "each pair is associated with a time lag @xmath37t@xmath43 = t@xmath45 - t@xmath27 .",
    "the dcf for a given time lag , @xmath34 , is then constructed as    @xmath50    where the sum runs over the m pairs of observations separated by @xmath34 - @xmath51t/2 @xmath19 @xmath37t@xmath43 @xmath19 @xmath34+@xmath51t/2 where @xmath51 t is the chosen bin - width .",
    "the uncertainty on the value of the dcf in a given bin is calculated as the rms variance of all the contributing ucdf@xmath43 about the value dcf(@xmath34 ) .",
    "the dcf for each of the x - ray bands with the gamma - ray data is shown in figure  [ fig : dcfs - xraygamma ] . in these plots ,",
    "the x - axis is defined such that in the gamma - pca dcf for example , a positive lag means that the gamma - ray data lagged the x - ray data . for the xrt - gamma - ray dcf",
    ", four - day binning is used due to the sparsity of the xrt data . for the asm - gamma - ray dcf ,",
    "one - day binning is used and , for the pca- and bat - gamma - ray dcf , two - day binning is used . according to both",
    "the ssc and ec models for blazar emission , the same population of electrons is responsible for the x - ray and the gamma - ray emission .",
    "therefore , the x - ray and gamma - ray lightcurves should be correlated . for the well - sampled asm , pca and bat lightcurves ,",
    "a zero - lag correlation is seen clearly , with peak values of the dcf at zero lag of 0.44 , 0.56 and 0.39 , respectively .",
    "the shape of the dcf looks similar for the bat and asm data , as their lightcurves are similar .",
    "the pca data have the smallest uncertainties and also show the highest dcf value at zero lag .    to measure the chance probability of accidental correlations in the dcf , the monte carlo method described in @xcite",
    "was employed .",
    "taking a correlation at zero lag as the a priori hypothesis , the chance probability of obtaining the measured value of the dcf at zero lag , with the assumption that the times of the flares are randomly sequenced , was calculated .",
    "100,000 lightcurves were simulated with the same characteristic timescale as the pca , determined by the sf analysis ( section  [ section : sf ] ) .",
    "the dcf was calculated for each of these simulated lightcurves and the gamma - ray lightcurve .",
    "the chance probability of obtaining a dcf value at or above 0.56 from this monte carlo method was found to be 0.1% .",
    "we can state therefore , with reasonable confidence that the gamma - ray and pca x - ray data are correlated within 1.5 days .",
    "figure  [ fig : opt - gamma - correlation ] shows the flux - flux correlation for the gamma - ray and optical data ( linear fluxes ) .",
    "each dataset was first normalized by dividing each flux point by the mean flux in that waveband so that the flux - flux correlations between the gamma - ray and optical data could be more easily compared . using a weighted total least - squares algorithm @xcite , which took into account uncertainties in the optical and the gamma - ray data , a straight line was fitted to each of the flux - flux plots .",
    "although not well - correlated , the data do show a somewhat negative correlative trend , with the high - flux gamma - ray points tending to coincide with the low - flux optical points and vice versa .",
    "the slopes of the lines shown in figure  [ fig : opt - gamma - correlation ] are found to decrease marginally as energy increases , with a slope of -0.60 in the r - band , -0.43 in the v - band and -0.40 in the b - band .",
    "we searched for correlations between fluxes in the optical r - band , which was the best - sampled of the optical lightcurves , and all other non - optical wavebands presented in this investigation using the dcf .",
    "of all the pairs of wavebands investigated , only the dcf between the optical and tev lightcurves , presented in figure  [ fig : optical - gamma - dcf ] , shows noteworthy features .",
    "the dcf indicates a possible optical - tev correlation with the optical flux lagging the tev flux by about 7 days .",
    "an elevated level of correlation is also seen with the optical leading the tev by 25 to 45 days @xcite .",
    "we investigated the significance of these possible correlations using simulated optical lightcurves with the same variability properties as the observed r - band lightcurve .",
    "the simulated optical lightcurves were generated deterministically as a superposition of harmonic oscillators with random phases whose frequencies are integer multiples of a fundamental frequency corresponding to the total length of the campaign .",
    "the amplitude of an oscillator at a given frequency is drawn from a power spectral density ( psd ) function derived from the first - order structure function of the observed r - band lightcurve . assuming the process(es ) responsible for the optical variability are stationary over the period of observation , the slope of the psd , @xmath52 , at a given frequency is related to the slope of the first - order structure function , @xmath53 , by @xmath54 .",
    "using this relation , we derive the psd of our simulated light curves by a fit to the first - order structure function that rises linearly with a slope @xmath55 until the beginning of the break at @xmath56 , is flat ( @xmath57 ) between @xmath58 d @xmath59 d , and then rises again with slope @xmath60 .",
    "after multiple realizations of the campaign using simulated optical lightcurves which are , by definition , not correlated with the tev lightcurve , we can assess the probability to have seen the observed correlation features due to chance .",
    "for each realization , we compute the dcf between the simulated optical and the real tev lightcurves . for each bin of the dcf , we record the values of the correlation coefficient , @xmath42 , its error , @xmath61 , and the test statistic @xmath62 .",
    "after many realizations , we build the distribution of @xmath63 seen in each bin of the dcf and compute the chance probability to have found the observed value of @xmath64 or higher by integrating the distribution above @xmath65 .",
    "this gives us the chance probability of having observed a given correlation in a particular bin , but it does not speak to the likelihood of correlation _ features _ involving more than one bin . to assess the likelihood of the observed dcf features as a whole , we construct two more distributions",
    ", @xmath66 where for @xmath67 the product runs over all dcf bins , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , and for @xmath70 the product runs over bins with @xmath71 . using these two distributions",
    ", we find the likelihood to have observed the optical precursor ( postcursor ) features by chance to be @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "further investigation reveals that the dcf feature seen at @xmath74 d probably arises due to contamination from the r - band auto - correlation function , which also exhibits features at multiples of 7 days .",
    "the possible reality of the optical precursor emission is more difficult to assess since our method assesses all the correlation features on a given side of the dcf at once .",
    "unfortunately , it would not have been possible to narrow the likelihood computation to smaller range of @xmath34 in order to assess a particular feature without subjecting the result to an unknown trials penalty .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are shown on three representative dates in figure  [ fig : sed-3nights ] when the vhe emission was at a high ( mjd 53763 ; filled blue squares ) , medium ( mjd 53852 ; open green circles ) and low ( mjd 53820 ; closed red triangles ) emission level ; these dates were chosen because there were multiwavelength data available over the full spectrum .",
    "they were not chosen where there was the best correlation with the flux at x - ray wavelengths and hence the seds are more typical .",
    "these nights are marked on the gamma - ray lightcurve in figure  [ fig : gamma ] .",
    "on mjd 53763 , 135 minutes of non - contiguous gamma - ray data were taken ; on mjd 53852 , 138 minutes of non - contiguous gamma - ray data were taken while on mjd 53820 , 90 minutes of non - contiguous gamma - ray data were taken .",
    "the optical data shown on the sed has the galaxy contribution subtracted .",
    "there was no significant variation in the radio fluxes over the three dates .",
    "the x - ray spectrum for the pca data was obtained using xspec while the tev spectrum was obtained using the forward - folding method described in @xcite .",
    "mrk421 was in the field of view of the bat during parts of each of the three observations .",
    "it was detected on mjd 53763 and mjd 53852 and upper limits were obtained for mjd 53820 .",
    "a spectral analysis of the bat survey mode data on mrk421 was performed for two nights , mjd 53763 and mjd 53852 .",
    "the bat data from these nights comprised 74 minutes and 44 minutes respectively and were processed using standard swift ftools to remove the diffuse background and the effects of other bright point sources in the field of view .",
    "eight - channel spectral and response files were produced for the position of mrk421 for each observation and were fit using xspec 11 to a simple power - law model to provide fluxes in the energy range of 14 - 195 kev .",
    "the highest energy at which a significant detection was made with the bat was 75kev .",
    "the data from the nights chosen to represent the high - state and medium - state of mrk421 are plotted in figures  [ fig : sed - model1 ] and  [ fig : sed - model2 ] along with archival mrk421 data @xcite .",
    "the dashed purple lines show the synchrotron and self - compton distributions for the parameters given in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the black dot - dashed curves show a hypothetical black - body component peaked at 1 @xmath75 m and the corresponding external compton component .",
    "the red solid line shows the sum of the ssc and ec models fitting results , which , in both cases , is in good agreement with the simultaneous optical , x - ray and gamma - ray data .",
    "the mrk421 observations presented in this paper comprise one of the most comprehensive datasets , both in terms of spectral and temporal coverage , ever accumulated on a blazar .",
    "the well - sampled optical lightcurves , in particular , differentiate this campaign from others undertaken previously . like some of these , this campaign was not triggered by mrk421 entering some pre - defined emission state .",
    "rather , data were gathered regardless of the flux level observed from mrk421 in any particular waveband .",
    "great care was taken to ensure that the data were calibrated properly in each waveband so that the effects of changing atmospheric conditions , nightly sky - brightness fluctuations or instrumental differences were removed from the data .",
    "the broadband temporal variability of mrk421 was examined by computing the fractional rms variability amplitude and the point - to - point fractional rms variability amplitude for each waveband in which it was detected consistently throughout the campaign .",
    "a general trend of increasing f@xmath23 towards higher frequencies was observed , with the radio and optical data exhibiting very low variabilities while the x - ray and gamma - ray data had high fractional rms variability amplitudes .",
    "@xcite probed the fractional rms variability amplitude for mrk421 data taken during 2003 - 2004 .",
    "these data covered a subset of the wavebands presented here ( 14.5 ghz radio , r - band optical , 3 - 25 kev x - ray and 0.2 - 20tev gamma ray ) and , like the 2005 - 2006 data , were binned in one - day bins . except for the 14.5ghz radio data ,",
    "f@xmath23 was always larger for the 2003 - 4 dataset .",
    "in general however , the differences between the f@xmath23 values for the 2005 - 2006 data and 2003 - 2004 data , are small , ranging between 15% and 33% .",

    "a trend of increasing f@xmath23 with increasing energy was observed .",
    "the fractional rms variability amplitudes computed here for the x - ray data during 2005 - 2006 were all higher than those obtained in 1997 - 1998 .",
    "however , the 1997 - 1998 data had much finer binning applied ( 200s-2500s ) and covered a narrower energy range ( 0.26 to 4.76 kev ) than the lightcurves shown here so , although the same trend of increasing f@xmath23 with energy was observed , the variability was being probed on different timescales and over a different energy range than those shown here .",
    "@xcite found evidence for a power - law behavior of f@xmath23 over four decades of energy for mrk421 on mjd 51991 - 51992 , with f@xmath23 @xmath76 e@xmath77 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fvar - pwrlaw ] shows f@xmath23 as a function of energy for mrk421 during the campaign presented here .",
    "the uncertainties on f@xmath23 were calculated as described in @xcite . unlike the data from mjds 51991 & 51992 , the 2005 - 2006 data are not well - described by a power - law fit .",
    "the timescales being probed are much longer here however , and also , a larger energy span ( 15 decades ) is available so the engine is being probed in quite a different regime .    the bat data ( 15 - 50 kev ) had the highest value of f@xmath23 at 0.993 but , due to the fact that a statistically significant detection ( defined here as @xmath53@xmath41 ) was only obtained on 42.3% of the nights , the bat data are not considered a consistently significant enough detection to include their f@xmath23 and f@xmath24 values in the final analysis .",
    "the bat energy band falls just at the upper end of the synchrotron peak for mrk421 so , presumably , given that the synchrotron peaks of bl lacs are known to shift in strength and in energy on many timescales , there were many nights on which the x - ray flux from mrk421 was below the detection threshold of the bat due to the shifting synchrotron peak .",
    "x - ray photons were detected up to 75 kev with the bat during this campaign with no significant detection above these energies .",
    "the bat energy regime was the waveband in which the most dramatic increase ( a factor of 5.3 ) over the mean flux level , which was usually very low , was observed .",
    "this occurred on mjd 53909 , after the end of the gamma - ray observing campaign .",
    "the second and third highest nights in the bat energy regime were mjds 53875 & 53876 , when fluxes of 4.0 and 3.7 the mean level ( respectively ) were observed .",
    "no gamma - ray data were taken on mjd 53875 but on mjds 53874 and 53876 , the gamma - ray flux was at 0.55 and 1.30 its mean level .",
    "the maximum nightly gamma - ray rate of 2.5 times the mean nightly rate was recorded approximately 10 days later on mjd 53884 . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : x - gamma - fluxovermean ] , the x - ray and gamma - ray data are , in general , correlated with similar levels of fluctuation being present in the lower - energy x - ray data ( xrt , asm and pca ) and the gamma - ray data but with larger variations often occurring at the higher energies covered by the bat .    as shown in figures  [ fig : x - gamma - correlation ] and  [ fig : x - gamma - log - correlation ] , where all data taken within one day of each other are plotted , there is evidence for a correlation between the gamma - ray data and the xrt , asm and pca data ( i.e. 0.2 - 25 kev ) in both linear and log - space but , no evidence for a positive correlation with the bat data ( 15 - 50 kev ) .",
    "the slopes of the best - fit lines to the x - ray and gamma - ray data in figure  [ fig : x - gamma - log - correlation ] are consistent with that found by @xcite in the 2 to 10 kev band when , unlike during the campaign described here , mrk421 was in an active state .",
    "figure  [ fig : x - gamma - asm ] shows the flux - flux correlation for the gamma - ray and asm data on daily , weekly and monthly timescales .",
    "the data show evidence for correlation on all of these timescales .",
    "the dcf shows a similar shape for the asm , pca and bat data with a peak visible at zero - lag for each dataset ( figure  [ fig : dcfs - xraygamma ] ) . as described in section  [ sec : x - gamma ] , simulated lightcurves indicated that the chance probability of this feature for the pca data is low ( 0.1% ) , lending support to ssc and ec models , where the x - ray and gamma - ray emission are produced by the same population of accelerated electrons .",
    "the well - sampled optical lightcurve , in particular that in the r - band , allowed a detailed correlation analysis to be carried out between the optical and tev data .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : opt - gamma - correlation ] , these data were not found to be well - correlated .",
    "although a peak at -7 days was seen in the optical - gamma - ray dcf ( figure  [ fig : optical - gamma - dcf ] ) , indicating that the optical lags the tev , it was shown that the likelihood of seeing such a peak by chance was 20% and that a feature in the autocorrelation function of the r - band data , which occurs at multiples of 7 days , was likely responsible for this feature in the dcf .    for the high- and medium - state nights ( mjd 53763 and 53852 , respectively ) we compare our results to a simple one - zone ssc model with an external compton component .",
    "we make an ad - hoc assumption of comptonization of a one micron emission - component reflected back into the jet .",
    "using the prescription of @xcite we determine the break energy and maximum energy of the electron spectrum using a simple model of diffusive shock acceleration . while the fraction of light scattered back into the jet is a completely free parameter , the maximum electron energy , pair absorption in the source , and shape of the ic peak are all determined in a self - consistent way .",
    "the resulting model fits to the sed are shown for the high - state night in figure  [ fig : sed - model1 ] and for the low - state night in figure  [ fig : sed - model2 ] .",
    "we note that the lightcurves of mrk421 in this campaign as well as in previous studies show roughly symmetric flares with comparable rise and fall times . by fitting the measured optical and x - ray structure functions to those generated from simulated lightcurves ( composed of a random sequence of triangular flares )",
    "we derive a characteristic rise - time of approximately 0.6 days in the x - ray variability , and between 10 and 20 days in the optical .",
    "this is in general agreement with the difference in cooling times for the electron populations generating the optical and x - ray synchrotron emission , where we expect :    @xmath78    as detailed in the following paragraph , with the simple model adopted here , it is difficult to obtain a good fit to the rather hard power - law tev emission without invoking extreme values for some of the model parameters ( high doppler factor , low magnetic field and small emission region ) perhaps indicating that a more detailed theoretical analysis is warranted .",
    "we find a low value for the magnetic field ( b @xmath6 0.12gauss ) similar to the value of 0.1gauss found by @xcite during june 2006 .",
    "their best fits however , gave a significantly lower value for the doppler factor ( @xmath79 ) , compared with the value ( @xmath80 ) found here , which we note is similar to that found in some previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this high value for the doppler factor results in some inconsistencies in the shock acceleration parameters namely , a very hard electron spectrum ( @xmath81 ) contrary to the predictions for non - relativistic diffusive shock acceleration ( giving e@xmath82 ) or ultra - relativistic shock acceleration ( giving e@xmath83 ) .",
    "the acceleration efficiency would have to be quite low , with the mean - free - path for scattering @xmath620 times the bohm limit and a shock velocity of 0.02@xmath84 , resulting in relatively few shock crossings .",
    "if the extreme parameters suggested by the simple model adopted here are correct , these observations lend some support to a new model for relativistic shock acceleration @xcite , which predicts a spectral index of 1.5 or , they could indicate an even more dramatic departure from the shock - acceleration model , such as the poynting jet model described in @xcite .",
    "it is clear however , that more detailed observations and modeling are necessary before stronger conclusions on such models can be drawn .",
    "the parameters used for both fits shown in figures  [ fig : sed - model1 ] and  [ fig : sed - model2 ] are listed in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the only differences between the medium - state and high - state fits in these fits are the fraction of the optical light and the luminosity of the optical emitting region .",
    "we note that the flux in the x - ray band was higher and the spectrum harder on the medium state gamma - ray night and was lower and softer than this on the high state gamma - ray night",
    ".    for markarian501 @xcite used external seed photons from a slow jet component to reproduce the tev emission with lower doppler factors . however , when we attempt to fit the mrk421 data in this way , we find that we can no longer fit the detailed shape of the declining x - ray and tev spectrum .",
    "while there are too many free parameters to find a unique solution , or to draw definitive conclusions , it is clear that a large contribution from an external compton component is a strong possibility for mrk421 .",
    "while the data do not demand an external compton component , the additional cooling may be present and can reduce the maximum energy for shock acceleration , somewhat mitigating the aforementioned problems . increasing the cooling further quickly results in a compton - catastrophe , overproducing the observed gamma - ray emission .",
    "the radio portion of the sed is not well - fit by this single - zone model .",
    "although the tev blazars are weak radio sources , the data have sufficiently good statistics to indicate that strong variability , characteristic of blazars at higher energies , is not present in the radio band so , it is likely that a different population of particles is responsible for the synchrotron emission at these energies .",
    "the agn monitoring campaign is ongoing at the whipple 10 m telescope .",
    "in addition to providing long - term lightcurves on tev blazars , which are even more relevant now that the _ fermi _ space telescope ( formally glast ) is providing longterm monitoring of the sky in the mev - gev energy range , these observations can also be used to trigger veritas and other vhe detectors when any of the agn bring monitored enter a high emission state @xcite .",
