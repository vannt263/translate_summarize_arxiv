    "contraction of thin liquid layers on solid surfaces due to dewetting or drying is a common phenomenon .",
    "it is observable for instance , on plants leafs as the water breaks up into small droplets , in non - sticking pans as the oil layer shrinks or on an outdoor oil - polluted surface after rain .",
    "another well - know example is the contraction of the liquid layer covering the eyeball , the characteristic time scale of a complete contraction being the time elapsed between two successive blinks @xcite .",
    "dewetting plays an important role in the tire industry as well : when the contraction of the wetting layer on the tire s groove is too slow , aquaplaning is more likely to occur @xcite .",
    "dewetting is also important in the lubricant manufacturing , however in this case exactly the opposite effect is desired : the more a lubrifient remains on the surface of sliding pieces , i. e. the larger its contraction time , the better .",
    "along with the development of the polymer industry , contraction of polymer films started to gain interest @xcite .",
    "dewetting turned out to be a useful investigative tool for determining various rheological and interfacial properties of thin polymer films due to the fact that molecular properties are reflected in the macroscopic shape of the solid - liquid - gas triple interface @xcite .",
    "in other cases , liquids are used as carriers for certain substances ( nanoparticles , for example ) , thus dewetting eventually accompanied by drying on rough surfaces of such solutions , results in deposition of the dissolved substance on the substrate .",
    "in fact , this deposition process can only be controlled through controlling the dynamics of the carrier liquid film , and , in particular , the evolution of the morphology of the triple line . in a recent study ,",
    "dna molecules were deposited in a highly ordered array by dissolving them in a solvent and letting the solvent dewet a micropillar - structured surface @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of wetting on flat solid and liquid surfaces is quite well understood @xcite , however , despite its applicability , only a few experiments were performed on inhomogeneous , either patterned or disordered surfaces @xcite , while the dynamics of a receeding contact line remains almost unexplored . in spite of the apparent simplicity of the phenomenon , there are no simple , easily manageable models for describing it .",
    "although in the lubrication approximation the navier - stokes ( or , in the highly viscous regime the stokes ) equation reduces to two dimensions @xcite , the numerical modeling of layers with large planar extent is still computationally time consuming and cumbersome due to the discontinuities on the liquid - solid and liquid - gas interfaces .",
    "these discontinuities are tackled within the framework of phase - field models @xcite , but it remains unclear however , how substrate inhomogeneities would be introduced in such models .",
    "it is also also unsettled how the actual dynamics of the layer is influenced by the chosen particular form of the phase interface .",
    "the continuous emergence of newer and newer schemes in the topic suggests that the demand for a convenient approach for modeling thin liquid layers dynamics is still unsatisfied @xcite .",
    "based on the revolutionary paper of j. f. joanny and p. g. de gennes on the perturbed contact line shape @xcite , a series of depinning type models were constructed that aimed to describe interface dynamics in presence of disorder @xcite .",
    "these models are not restricted to dewetting phenomena , as they apply to fracture front propagation or even magnetic domain wall motion . in the framework of these models , small deformations of the interface and a linear restoring force acting on the contact line resulting from a perturbative approach",
    "are considered .",
    "they are thus inherently linear , and the only source of nonlinearity is the disorder of the landscape they propagate in . although they have had a great success in the sampling of the depinning transition and determination of various critical exponents @xcite , they have the drawback that they neither allow for large deformations , nor for local backward movement of the line .",
    "consequently , they are unable to account for the tearing up of the dewetting film , which , in fact , is a common phenomenon .",
    "our purpose here is precisely to address the question of large deformations and the eventual tearing of the film with an efficient and easily manageable model for the contact line motion .",
    "our method works best for viscous , flat and extended droplets with small wetting angle .",
    "it is shown that in this regime , in contrast to the perturbative treatment @xcite , the line is soft and ductile , meaning that a localized perturbation of the line induces only short range forces .",
    "considering a viscous regime , the line s equation of evolution becomes an overdamped one . in the following sections we will describe this method in detail",
    ", we will show how to handle substrate inhomogeneities , and an application is presented .",
    "let the upper surface of the contracting fluid layer be described by @xmath0 .",
    "our approach is restricted to the description of large , flat layers in the highly viscous regime , the same assumption that is made when deriving the lubricant equations @xcite , i.e. @xmath1 .",
    "one further assumption we make is that the relative change in the height of the droplet is small , therefore its height is almost constant in time , @xmath2 . under these considerations , the layer s free energy has two terms .",
    "the first component is the joint contribution of the well - known liquid - solid and liquid - gas ( air ) surface tensions .",
    "if the layer is flat , its upper and lower surface areas are approximately equal , @xmath3 . denoting by @xmath4 the appropriate surface tension coefficients , the surface energy writes as : @xmath5 the second contribution to the total free energy of the layer is the line energy which occurs due to the unbalanced forces acting on the layer boundaries on the molecules from the liquid - substrate - air triple interface .",
    "this is a curve with finite thickness , thus this energy is comparable to the surface energy and it is proportional to the length of the triple interface , @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the line tension coefficient .",
    "neither the interpretation of @xmath8 , nor its measurement is straightforward , in fact , there is still less consensus regarding its magnitude : values ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 were measured or computed in various experiments and simulations @xcite .",
    "the major difficulty arises from the fact that dewetting is often accompanied by a precursor layer with a much smaller thickness than the rest of the layer . in our case , in term ( [ line1 ] ) a contribution resulting from the layer s side surface has to be also considered .",
    "this yields an extra surface energy that is also proportional with @xmath6 , consequently , we believe that an effective @xmath8 has to be used instead",
    ". therefore in calculations larger values than the presented range should be used . in the case of a real two dimensional flow ( for instance , flow in a hele - shaw cell @xcite ) , the line tension is well defined and it is clearly a result from the finite side surface of the layer between the plates . for complete wetting , i.e. zero wetting angle , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distance between the plates of the hele - shaw cell @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if a quantitative upscaling of the elastic type of energy introduced in @xcite was possible ( properly removing the third dimension from the model ) , it could provide the correct expression for the line tension for sufficiently flat droplets , bounded by one solid surface only .",
    "such an expression however is not available , hence it remains an open question .",
    "the total free energy of the system is the sum of these two contributions : @xmath13 .",
    "our approach is based on the fact that both the surface and the line energies are functionals of the shape of the triple interface , which is a one - dimensional curve .",
    "when inertial effects do not play an important role ( the highly viscous , low reynolds number regime ) , the total energy of the system is uniquely defined by the shape of the contact line , it is therefore enough to track solely its dynamics .    in order to illustrate this",
    ", we consider a simple example : the dynamics of a circular hole . due to the symmetry of the problem , an analytically study is possible . from energy terms",
    "( [ surface1 ] ) and ( [ line1 ] ) the forces acting on the edge of the hole can be derived , which , due to symmetry considerations act in the radial direction @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the radius of the hole .",
    "similarly , the force resulting from the line tension : @xmath16 assuming an overdamped motion of the edge of the hole ( the triple interface ) , the following equation of motion yields for its radius : @xmath17 in the above expression , @xmath18 is the mobility of the three - phase line and is inversely proportional to its length , i.e. the longer the line , the more sluggish it is : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mobility of a line segment of length @xmath21 .",
    "the equation of motion for the contact line is thus : @xmath22 it can be seen that the equilibrium radius of the hole is @xmath23 which is an intrinsic length scale of the system . for large radii ( @xmath24 )",
    "the line energy can be neglected and the velocity of the contact line is constant : @xmath25    note that when @xmath15 is large , @xmath26 , which is in complete concordance with previous results , for instance @xcite .",
    "so far the mobility of the triple interface has been introduced as a phenomenological parameter which , in turn , defines the time - scale of the problem . considering the case when no slippage of the interface occurs (",
    "the flow of the interface is a poiseuille flow ) , in previous studies similar results to eq .",
    "( [ veloc1 ] ) have been derived for the radial velocity of the triple interface for a drying patch nucleated into a liquid film @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the equilibrium contact angle , @xmath6 is the rim width , @xmath29 is the extrapolation length ( the distance from the rim at which the velocity extrapolates to zero ) and @xmath30 is the viscosity . comparing eq .",
    "( [ veloc1 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ veloc2 ] ) one can identify the mobility given now in terms of independently measurable quantities that are now properties of the contact line :    @xmath31    in case of a curve - like interface with parametric equation @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is some arbitrary parameter ) , the equation of motion writes as @xmath34\\ \\cdot \\vec{f}[\\vec{r}(\\theta)],\\ ] ] hence the mobility and the force in this case are both functionals of the shape of the interface .",
    "in order to model the dynamics of contact lines of arbitrary shape , numerical methods are necessary . as a first step ,",
    "the contact line is discretized into _",
    "representative points_. after the contour is discretized , the points are connected through directed line segments ( vectors ) .",
    "each of the points `` tracks '' its previous and upcoming neighbors and , by convention , the vectors are directed so that the liquid always lies on their left hand side . following the direction of the vectors connecting the points , a directed chain is established .",
    "we denote by @xmath35 the index of the ensuing point corresponding to point @xmath36 and by @xmath37 the point preceding @xmath36 ( fig.[fig : model_sketch ] ) .",
    "discretization of the contact line.,width=226 ]    in terms of the representative points coordinates , the line and surface tension energies write as : @xmath38 once the energies are obtained , the forces acting on the representative points are computed as @xmath39 . in our two - dimensional approximation ,",

    "it can be readily seen that each point interacts with its nearest neighbors only , therefore a molecular dynamics type simulation is suitable for investigating their dynamics .",
    "we emphasize that the localized nature of the forces is a direct consequence of our primary hypothesis , i.e. the droplet is flat and its height profile does not change significantly during the movement of the contact line . either at lower scales , where the fine structure of the contact line becomes relevant or in the case of non - flat droplets the green function of the contact line ( its response to a localized perturbation ) is of long - range nature . as mentioned in the introduction , a perturbative treatment for small deformations of the contact line",
    "is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the propagation of such lines in random media resulting in depinning transition and a consequent advancing accompanied by avalanches are extensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . for the present case",
    ", we stick to the lubricant approximation , thus proceed with eq .",
    "( [ forces ] ) .",
    "the overdamped equation of motion for the points is : @xmath43 the mobility @xmath44 associated to point @xmath36 is inversely proportional to the length element of the respective point on the triple interface : @xmath45 where we remind that @xmath46 is the distance between point @xmath36 and its upcoming neighbor , while @xmath47 is the distance between point @xmath36 and its previous neighbor . during their dynamics , the representative points will approach or move away from each other . in order to preserve numerical accuracy",
    ", their density on the triple line should be kept constant . imposing a constant density",

    "they come closer than another predefined distance @xmath49 , one of the points is removed . as a rule of thumb ,",

    "the existence of such a threshold , lower than @xmath92 has been shown experimentally @xcite , however , since the experiment was carried out in gravity , its value is related to the capillary length . in our case ,",
    "the obtained lower limit is merely a consequence of the competition between the line and surface tensions and the value @xmath94 is thus a consequence of the underlying disorder .",
    "it is related to the percolation of the contact line between the localized defects .",

    "interestingly however , we could not observe such a transition , even for extremely low values of @xmath87 and @xmath80 . in their experiments , duprat et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the depinning of a wetting contact line from an individual defect . they reported that depending on the pinning strength the contact line either jumped off the defect or completely wetted it , and advanced by tearing up and leaving an air hole behind . for individual or localized group of inhomogeneities",
    "we observed the same behavior , however , it turned out to be impossible to recover a collective depinning transition without the tearing up of the film .",
    "this is probably the result of the high ductility of the contact line .",
    "the classical depinning transition occurs due to the competition between disorder and long range elastic restoring forces @xcite , while in our case , we lack the long range part , therefore , we encounter a new transition , which is mainly governed by large deformations and tearing up of the layer . in the experiments of paterson and fermigier @xcite , the authors distinguish between strong and weak pinning as a function of the spatial distribution of the inhomogeneities . in the strong pinning case , defects were spread randomly and uniformly over the whole surface , while in the weak pinning case , they were spread by positioning randomly only one defect in each unit cell of a larger square lattice , hence obtaining a more homogeneous pattern . for the same defect concentration , the second case results in smaller average distance @xmath87 between the defects .",
    "the observation that in the strong pinning case ( small @xmath87 ) the contact line breaks up , and in the weak pinning case ( large @xmath87 ) it advances with a rather smooth shape , is compatible with our simulation results , even though we tuned @xmath87 by changing the defect concentration rather than changing their distribution or correlation .",
    "another major difference compared to classical depinning models is that in our system local backward movements of the interface may appear , and , indeed , approaching the transition , positive velocities of the representative points occur , which plays an important role in the roughening mechanism .",
    "figure [ fig : velocities ] shows how the distribution of the velocity components in the @xmath73 direction changes as we approach the transition point .",
    "far from the transition point we experience an almost bimodal distribution ( one peak corresponding to the unpinned part , while the other one , at zero , to the pinned part ) , while close to it we obtain an almost zero - averaged symmetric distribution . clearly , it is due to the slight asymmetry that the contact line moves forward on average .",

    "note that when we approach the depinning transition ( @xmath104 ) a considerable local backward movement ( @xmath105 ) of the interface occurs . also , far from the transition ( @xmath106 ) , the pinned part of the line is quite well separated from the moving part.,width=302 ]    in order to quantify the morphology of the contact line around the transition , we performed a classical rasterization analysis .",

    "<S> a molecular - dynamics type simulation method , which is suitable for investigating the dewetting dynamics of thin and viscous liquid layers , is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the method is exemplified by studying a two - parameter depinning - like model defined on inhomogeneous solid surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology and the statistical properties of the contact line is mapped in the relevant parameter space , and as a result critical behavior in the vicinity of the depinning transition is revealed . </S>",
    "<S> the model allows for the tearing of the layer , which leads to a new propagation regime resulting in non - trivial collective behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the large deformations observed for the interface is a result of the interplay between the substrate inhomogeneities and the capillary forces . </S>"
