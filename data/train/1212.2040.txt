    "black hole binaries ( bhbs ) , and cyg  x-1  in particular , show dramatic spectral variability .",
    "the most dramatic variations observed in bhbs are spectral transitions which occur , for most of these sources , on the time scales from weeks to days @xcite . in the simplest classification , bhbs ,",
    "are observed in two main spectral states : in the hard state ( hs ) the source emits essentially radiation peaking around 100 kev @xcite , while in the soft state ( ss ) the x - ray spectrum is a prominent @xmath31 kev black - body plus a power - law tail ( zdziarski 2000 and ref .",
    "therein ) .",
    "the hs spectrum is believed to originate from thermal comptonization in a hot electrons dominated cloud ( the so - called `` corona '' ; eardley , lightman & shapiro 1975 ; sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) .",
    "the black - body dominated spectrum observed in ss was associated with the optically thick accretion disc @xcite , while the origin of the weak steep power - law component is still debated @xcite .",
    "in addition spectra with properties that are intermediate between that of the ss and hs are observed when the sources switches from one of the two stable state to the other .",
    "terms such as `` hard intermediate '' , or `` soft intermediate '' are often used to describe different flavors of those intermediate state @xcite but there is no unique classification ( see mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) .    the spectra of bhbs consist in several components . in the hs of cyg",
    "x-1 , the electron temperature and the thomson optical depth of the comptonizing plasma were found to be typically @xmath4 = 50100 kev and @xmath5 = 13 @xcite .",
    "although the scattering electrons have a predominantly maxwellian energy distribution in the hs , there are indications that the electron distribution may have some high - energy tail i.e. , it is hybrid , thermal / non - thermal .",
    "the first evidence has been provided by _",
    "cgro_/comptel observations at e @xmath6 500 kev of cyg  x-1  in hard state @xcite . a slight indication was also inferred by _",
    "cgro_/osse observations of gx 3394 @xcite . then",
    ", with the _ integral _  mission , this feature has been observed many times during hard and/or intermediate / hard states in a number of bhbs and bh candidates ( bhc ; see del santo 2012 for a review on this topic ) , such as 1e 1740.72942 @xcite , gx 3394 @xcite , cyg x1 ( malzac et al .",
    "2006 ; cadolle bel et al .",
    "2006 ; jourdain , roques & malzac 2012 ; zdziarski , lubiski & sikora 2012 ) .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the non - thermal excess and thermal comptonization component are not produced by the same electron distribution but in separate regions of the corona with different physical properties ( malzac 2012 ) . also , radio observations of cygnus x-1 have resolved a compact relativistic jet ( stirling et al .",
    "2001 ) and it was suggested that the high energy excess may be a component arising from it ( rahoui et al .",
    "this idea has been also proposed following the hard x - ray polarization measurements by laurent et al .",
    "( 2011 ) obtained with the ibis telescope in compton mode .",
    "these authors found that , while the 250400 kev spectrum is consistent with emission dominated by compton scattering by thermal electrons and are weakly polarized ( pf @xmath7 20% ) , the second spectral component seen in the 400 kev2 mev band is strongly polarized ( pf = 67@xmath8 30% ) .",
    "they have argued that the mev excess is likely to be produced in jet through synchrotron emission in a very coherent magnetic field .",
    "such a high degree of polarization is indeed difficult to achieve through inverse compton emission in the corona .",
    "recently jourdain et al .",
    "( 2012 ) reported on a similar result by using the spi telescope .",
    "they found that above 230 kev the cyg  x-1  emission is indeed polarized , with a mean polarization fraction of 76@xmath8 15% .",
    "the shape of the mev excess however , appears difficult to reproduce in the jet scenario ( zdziarski , lubiski & sikora 2012 ) .",
    "such a scenario would also imply that the mev excess in the hs and the non - thermal power - law emission observed in the ss have a completely different nature since the radio jet is quenched in the ss .",
    "we note that although it is very plausible that the non - thermal excess originates in the jet , it appears very unlikely that the jet emission could dominate the entire high energy spectrum of cyg  x-1  ( see e.g. malzac , belmont & fabian 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "the x/@xmath9-ray ss spectrum of cyg  x-1   has been studied extensively by simultaneous observations with _ asca _ , _ rxte _ , _ bepposax _ , and _ cgro _  during summer 1996 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the dominating black - body , a long power - law like tail extending up to 10 mev was discovered @xcite .",
    "the high energy spectrum is well described by single compton scattering off electrons having a nearly power - law distribution ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter g99 ; frontera et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the different spectral states are usually understood in terms of changes in the geometry of the accretion flow . according to a popular scenario ( see e.g. done , gierliski & kubota 2007 for an exhaustive review ) , in the ss a geometrically thin accretion disc ( the standard shakura - sunyaev disc )",
    "extends down to the last stable orbit and is responsible for the dominant black - body emission .",
    "this disc is the source of soft seed photons for comptonization in small active coronal regions located above and below the disc .",
    "the magnetic field lines rise above the accretion disc through magnetic buoyancy , transporting a significant fraction of the accretion power into the corona where it is then dissipated through magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "this leads to particle acceleration in the corona .",
    "a population of high - energy electrons is formed which then cools down by up - scattering the soft photons emitted by the disc .",
    "this produces the high - energy non - thermal emission ( see e.g. g99 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the hs",
    ", the standard geometrically thin disc is truncated at distances ranging from a few tens to a few thousand gravitational radii from the black hole . in its inner parts",
    ", the accretion flow takes the form of a hot geometrically thick , optically thin disc ( esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 ) . in this hot accretion flow",
    ", the electrons are predominantly heated by coulomb interaction with a population of hot ions and cool down by comptonizing their own synchrotron emission and/or soft photons from the accretion disc .",
    "the different electron distributions in hs and ss could be caused by kinetic processes and changing because of varying physical conditions in the corona ( malzac & belmont 2009 , hereafter mb09 ; poutanen & vurm 2009 , hereafter pv09 ) .",
    "these authors showed that in presence of a magnetic field in the corona , the electron distribution can appear thermal , even when acceleration mechanisms would produce non thermal distributions .",
    "this is due to fast and efficient thermalization through synchrotron self - absorption as first pointed out by ghisellini , guilbert & svensson ( 1988 ) .",
    "mb09 and pv09 , presented a rough fit by eye of the average cgro data of cyg  x-1  with this synchrotron boiler model which already provided estimates of the magnetic field in the hard state under the assumption that the non - thermal excess is produced by electrons in the same zone as the maxwellian component . in this paper",
    ", we will use the same model to perform a statistical fit of _ integral _   data for the whole range of observed spectral shapes and also considering the possibility that the non - thermal excess in the hard state may have a different origin .    as one of the brighter galactic hard x - ray source , cyg  x-1",
    "is a prime target for the _ integral _  mission @xcite .",
    "it was extensively observed during the performance verification ( pv ) phase of the mission .",
    "the on - board instruments offer an unprecedented simultaneous broad - band spectral coverage , ranging from 3 kev to several mev .",
    "thus a large amount of observing time ( open time and core programme for a total of about 7 ms ) have been dedicated to this target by _",
    "integral_. a number of studies of the intermediate spectral states have been performed ( malzac et al .",
    "2006 ; cadolle bel et al .",
    "2006 ) ; an x - ray flare during the hard state appears to be coincident with the tev emission detected by magic ( albert et al .",
    "2007 ; malzac et al . 2008 ) .",
    "recent papers have also provided a refined estimation of the distance ( d=1.86 kpc ; reid et al .",
    "2011 ) and the black - hole mass of cyg  x-1  ( 14.8 m@xmath10 ; orosz et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we present the long term behaviour and a spectral variability study of cyg  x-1  using the whole _ integral _",
    "data base available until spring 2009 . rather than following the evolution of the source chronologically , the aim was to extract high quality data representative of the source in a given spectral state. for this purpose , we stacked all the pointings with similar hardness ratios to produce 12 averaged spectra spanning the whole range of observed spectral shapes .",
    "the details of how this was done are described in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "these 12 broad band ( 3 kev1 mev ) spectra were then fit with two different hybrid thermal comptonization models namely eqpair @xcite and belm ( belmont , malzac & marcowith 2008 ; hereafter b08 ) that are described in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "this allows us to constrain the physical conditions in the corona and determine how the physical parameters change during the spectral evolution .",
    "in particular , fits with belm sets quantitative constraints on the strength of the magnetic field in the corona of cygnus x-1 for the first time .",
    "these results are described and discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",

    "we started from march 2003 ( revolution 52 ) , thus we excluded the performance verification phase observations ( 1 ms ) due to some peculiar instrument settings .",

    "the total spi exposure time is essentially the same as that of ibis , even though a further analysis excluding spi problematic pointings ( i.e. solar flares , radiation belts ) leads to a slightly lower spi effective exposure time than ibis . because of the smaller fov of the x - ray telescope jem - x , the related selected pointings ( fov of @xmath12 has been considered ) are 364 ( see tab .
