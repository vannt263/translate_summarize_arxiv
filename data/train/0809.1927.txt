    "the potential between a heavy quark and its anti - quark is a crucial quantity both for understanding fundamental properties of qcd , such as confinement , and for describing the rich phenomenology of heavy quarkonia  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review about the static potential ) .    within perturbation theory",
    "the static potential can be computed as an expansion in the strong coupling @xmath0 and the inverse heavy - quark mass or , equivalently , in the heavy - quark velocity @xmath1 . the leading order result in @xmath1",
    "is known up to the two - loop approximation  @xcite which has been completed about ten years ago .",
    "for the three - loop corrections there are only estimates relying on pad approximations  @xcite or based on renormalon studies  @xcite .",
    "a new feature of the three - loop corrections is the appearance of an infrared divergence which was discussed for the first time in ref .",
    "a quantitative analysis of this effect can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) where a proper definition of the static potential within perturbation theory is provided .",
    "furthermore , it is argued that the infrared singularities cancel in physical quantities after including the contribution where so - called ultra - soft gluons interact with the heavy quark anti - quark bound state ( see also , e.g. , refs .",
    "higher order logarithmic contributions to the infrared behaviour of the static potential have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compute the fermionic contribution to the three - loop static potential which is infrared safe .",
    "partial results have already been published in refs .  @xcite .",
    "the static potential enters as a building block in a variety of physical quantities . often at three - loop order only estimations",
    "are used or the three - loop coefficient  usually called @xmath2  appears as a parameter in the final result .",
    "let us in this context mention the determination of the bottom and top quark mass from the ground state energy of the heavy quark system which has been computed to third order in ref .",
    "the error on the mass values due to the unknown three - loop coefficient amounts to 14% ( 13% ) of the total uncertainty for the bottom ( top ) quark .",
    "similarly , @xmath2 enters the calculation of the total cross section for top quark threshold production at next - to - next - to - next - to leading order ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the static energy between two heavy quarks has often been used in order to compare perturbative calculations with simulations on the lattice ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "also in this context the knowledge of @xmath2 is crucial and is expected to lead to a better agreement between the two approaches  @xcite .",
    "last not least let us mention the extraction of the strong coupling from lattice simulations where again the static potential plays a crucial role  @xcite and the knowledge of @xmath2 would be highly desirable .",
    "let us for completeness mention that the one - loop mass - suppressed corrections to the static potential have been evaluated in refs .",

    "a collection of all relevant contributions needed up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order can be found in ref .",
    "furthermore , the two - loop corrections for the case where the quark and anti - quark form an octet state have been evaluated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present details of our calculation . in particular",
    "we discuss the various types of feynman diagrams which occur at three - loop order and their contributions to the individual colour factors . in section  [ sec::results ] our results",
    "are presented and section  [ sec::concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "=    in the practical calculation of quantum corrections to the static potential one has to consider a heavy quark and its anti - quark which interact via the exchange of gluons . in fig .",

    "note that there is no colour factor @xmath20 since this contribution is generated via an iteration of the tree - level result .",

    "[ fig::diags](a ) leaving only the @xmath23 term as genuine one - loop contribution .    similarly , at two - loop order there are the colour factors @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 where the latter two originate from loop corrections to the gluon propagator connecting the quark and the anti - quark .",
    "@xmath6 contains no @xmath21 and @xmath28 terms since their contribution is again generated by iterations of lower - order results .",
    "the rule that a colour factor @xmath20 can only arise from corrections to a fermion bubble in a gluon line also holds at three - loop level . this requires a careful analysis of the colour factors for each class of diagram . for example , the colour factor of the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig::diags](e ) receives a contribution already present in eq .",
    "( [ eq::v ] ) . ] @xmath29 from two - loop fermionic subdiagram and a factor @xmath30 from the remaining crossed box structure .",
    "whereas the complete first factor has to be taken into account only the @xmath18 term of the second factor contributes to the potential . in a similar manner",
    "all diagrams have to be analyzed which leads to the colour structures @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in this paper",
    "we compute all coefficients except the one of @xmath31 .",
    "the results for the structures @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    at three - loop order",
    "there is a new class of diagrams containing a `` light - by - light '' subdiagram ( see fig .  [ fig::diags](f ) for a sample graph ) which develops the colour factors @xmath38 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that these contributions are not connected to iterations and are thus already present in qed ( i.e. for @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "=    since we use non - relativistic qcd as a starting point for the evaluation of the feynman diagrams the momentum transfer between the quark and the anti - quark represents the only relevant scale in the problem .",
    "thus all integrals can be mapped to the two - point functions which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::scalar ] in diagrammatical form .",
    "next to purely massless lines originating from the gluon , ghost and light - quark propagators also static lines from the heavy quarks are present .",
    "the one- and two - loop diagrams have been extensively studied in ref .",
    "as far as the three - loop diagrams are concerned one can perform a partial fractioning in those cases where three static lines meet at a vertex .",
    "this leads to many different three - loop graphs involving , however , at most three static lines .",
    "thus any resulting integral is labeled by twelve indices one of which corresponds to an irreducible numerator .",
    "altogether we have to consider about 70000 integrals ( allowing for a general qcd gauge parameter @xmath43 ) which can all be mapped to one of the diagrams shown in fig .  [ fig::graphs ] .",
    "thereby the linear propagators can appear in two variants : either in the form @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "if the loop momenta , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in the upper row of fig .  [ fig::graphs ] are chosen as the momenta of the three upper lines , then the first diagram appears in two ways : either with the product @xmath49 or with the product @xmath50 the second diagram appears with similar propagators where the momenta @xmath51 ( in the first variant with @xmath52 in all three terms ) are replaced by @xmath53 .",
    "the third diagram in the upper row of fig .  [ fig::graphs ] corresponds to @xmath54 and the fourth one to @xmath51 . in the case of the `` mercedes '' type diagrams in the lower row of fig .",
    "[ fig::graphs ] one chooses the loop momenta @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 as the momenta of the three lower lines . then the five diagrams appear with static propagators of the form @xmath44 with momenta @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , respectively .    =    for the calculation of the diagrams we proceed in the following way : they are generated with qgraf  @xcite and further processed with q2e and exp  @xcite where a mapping to the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig::scalar ] is achieved . in a next step the reduction of the integrals",
    "is performed with the program package fire  @xcite which implements a combination of the laporta  @xcite and the grbner algorithm ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this leads us to about 100 master integrals which have to be evaluated in an expansion in @xmath60 with the help of the mellin - barnes technique .",
    "non trivial examples are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite where also explicit results are given .",
    "we managed to compute all but four coefficients of the @xmath60 expansion analytically .",
    "as a crucial tool providing very important numerical cross checks of the analytical results we applied the program fiesta  @xcite which is a convenient and efficient implementation of the sector decomposition algorithm .",
    "finally , let us mention that we evaluate the colour factors with the help of the program color  @xcite .    in our calculation",
    "we allowed for a general gauge parameter @xmath43 in the gluon propagator and checked that @xmath43 drops out in the final result .",
    "this constitutes a strong check on the correctness of our result .    in order to obtain a finite result",
    "one has to renormalize the strong coupling which we perform within the @xmath4 scheme .",
    "the corresponding renormalization constant can , e.g. , be found in ref .",
