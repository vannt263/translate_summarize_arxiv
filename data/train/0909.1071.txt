    "over 20 years ago visser @xcite proposed a theoretical method for constructing a new class of wormholes from a black - hole spacetime .",
    "this type of wormhole is known as a thin - shell wormhole and is constructed by applying the so - called cut - and - paste technique : surgically graft two black - hole spacetimes together in such a way that no event horizon is permitted to form .",
    "this method yields a wormhole spacetime whose throat is a time - like hypersurface , i.e. , a three - dimensional thin shell . since visser s novel approach yields a way of minimizing the use of exotic matter to construct a wormhole , the technique was quickly adopted by various authors for constructing thin - shell wormholes @xcite .    in 1999",

    "the mathematical construction of our thin - shell wormhole begins by taking two copies of the regular charged black hole and removing from each the four - dimensional region @xmath17 here @xmath18 , the larger of the two radii .",

    ", so that the sense of the inequality in ( [ e : intermediate ] ) is not preserved , taking us out of the region of stability .",

    "this paper investigates a new thin - shell wormhole constructed by applying the cut - and - paste technique to two regular charged black - hole spacetimes first introduced by beato and garcia .",

    "the issue of stability is addressed in two ways : first by assuming the eos @xmath132 , @xmath133 , on the thin shell and then by analyzing the stability to linearized radial perturbations .",
    "the latter yields a single region of stability covering a wide range of values of the parameters @xmath134 and @xmath92 .",
    "the region includes the stable solutions that depend on the eos @xmath132 .    for our wormhole , the parameter @xmath109 , which is normally interpreted as the speed of sound , has the desired values @xmath131 , unlike the wormholes constructed from two scharzschild spacetimes @xcite .",
