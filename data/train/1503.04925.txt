    "an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is a bright central part of a galaxy that shines via the energy released by materials that falls toward the super massive black hole ( smbh ) . during its active phase",
    ", the agn luminosity can outshine that of the host galaxy , emitting an enormous amount of energy ( @xmath10@xmath11 ; e.g. , @xcite ) over a wide range of wavelengths from gamma - ray to radio .",
    "the spectrum of an agn provides us with important information concerning the structure and the physics around the smbh that powers the agn activity .",
    "high - energy photons , such as x - ray and uv , probe the accretion disk around the smbh that gives off hot thermal emission .",
    "optical photons trace the accretion disk or the broad and narrow line regions farther away from the smbh . meanwhile",
    ", infrared ( ir ) observations can trace the dust - heated radiation from the dusty torus or the star forming regions .",
    "finally , jets can be probed in the radio .    in recent years ,",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) wavelength region has become an important window for understanding agns . in general ,",
    "hot dust emission is known to be the main contributor to the nir light from an agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and many studies have been carried out using observations in the nir to understand the dust torus structures , such as the covering factor @xcite , dust torus size @xcite , hot dust temperature ( @xmath12 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and the evolution of circumnuclear dust @xcite .",
    "additionally , the nir wavelength region includes interesting emission / absorption line features such as the hydrogen paschen and brackett lines , the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature at 3.3@xmath0 m , and the absorption lines from @xmath13 ice ( 3.1@xmath0 m ) , @xmath14 ( 4.26@xmath0 m ) , and co ( 4.67@xmath0 m ) gas .",
    "these line features can be used to understand the blr size , the bh mass ( @xmath15 ) , the star formation , and the materials surrounding the nuclear region as outlined below .",
    "recently , nir paschen lines have been put forward as a useful @xmath15 estimator @xcite , since they are much less affected by dust extinction than the common @xmath15 estimators using uv / optical lines @xcite .",
    "a similar study can be extended to the brackett lines which would be even less affected by the dust than the paschen lines . in the case of @xmath16 = 2 mag ( a value corresponding to the typical color excess of dusty , red agns ; e.g. , @xcite ) , the br@xmath5 , br@xmath4 , p@xmath5 , and p@xmath4 line fluxes would be suppressed by factors of 1.31 , 1.62 , 2.16 , and 3.97 , respectively , assuming the galactic extinction law with @xmath17 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the br@xmath5 line is three times less affected by the dust extinction than the p@xmath4 line in this example .",
    "the 3.3@xmath0 m pah feature has been suggested as a possible star formation indicator @xcite , and has been detected in many local agns .",
    "a number of studies suggest that there may exist a correlation between the starburst ( traced by the 3.3@xmath0 m pah feature ) and the agn activity ( traced , e.g. , by 5100@xmath18 continuum luminosity , hereafter , @xmath19 ) , although the correlation may break down at very high ir luminosities @xcite . finally , molecular lines such as @xmath13 ice , @xmath14 , and co arise from molecular clouds or the diffused interstellar medium in the line of sight toward the agn @xcite , and they are useful tracers for the reservoir of molecular gas in the host galaxy and in the vicinity of an agn .",
    "nir hydrogen line ratios are also suggested as a useful means to understand the physical conditions of blr @xcite .",
    "studies of brackett lines and pah features have a special importance for understanding the evolutionary stages of galaxies , especially the dusty agn phase .",
    "dusty , red agns are agns whose optical light is obscured by the foreground dust ( see @xcite for the demography of various types of red agns ) .",
    "they are suspected to be an intermediate population in the evolution of galaxies , situated between the dust enshrouded star forming phase ( such as ultra luminous infrared galaxy , ulirg ) and the luminous agn phase . during the red agn stage , smbhs",
    "are expected to grow rapidly providing feedback to the star formation of host galaxies @xcite , but heavy dust extinction in host galaxies prohibits observational studies of the activities occurring in red , dusty agns .",
    "brackett lines and pah features can possibly serve as nir spectral diagnostics that can explore the agn and star formation activity of dusty , red agns due to the low extinction of the light in nir .    while studies of nir spectra at @xmath20 2.5@xmath0 m are common , studies based on the 2.55.0@xmath0 m spectra of nearby agns have been scarce , mainly due to the observational limitation caused either by atmospheric absorption or strong thermal background at @xmath21 2.5@xmath0",
    "m on the ground .",
    "in order to better understand the 2.55.0@xmath0 m spectra of agns , we conducted a spectroscopic study of 83 nearby agns using the @xmath3 infrared camera ( irc ) @xcite as a part of the @xmath3 mission program , quasar spectroscopic observation with nir grism ( qsong ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath3 irc covers the wavelength range 2.55.0@xmath0 m with r @xmath22 120 at 3.6@xmath0 m and offers high sensitivity at these wavelengths thanks to the cold and transparent environment in space .",
    "the scientific goals of our study are to ( 1 ) provide a spectral atlas of nearby , bright agns that have been studied extensively in previous works ; ( 2 ) establish the @xmath15 estimator using brackett lines so that we can estimate @xmath15 reliably by reducing the dust extinction effect ( the brackett - based @xmath15 estimator will be an improvement over paschen line - based estimators ) ; ( 3 ) understand the correlation between the hot dust emission and other agn properties ; and ( 4 ) study the 3.3@xmath0 m pah feature in agns to understand the connection between agn and star - formation activities . in this paper , we will describe the sample characteristics , present the 2.55.0@xmath0 m @xmath3 spectra of 83 agns , derive the @xmath15 estimator using the hydrogen brackett lines of 10 agns where the brackett lines are well detected , and investigate the correlation between the hot dust emission and agn properties .",
    "the investigation of the pah feature will appear in a future work .",
    "when constructing the sample , we impose the following two criteria . in order to place one of the redshifted brackett lines ( br@xmath4 and br@xmath5 ) in the irc spectroscopic wavelength range of 2.55.0@xmath0 m , our sample is limited to agns at @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , we selected objects that are brighter than 14 mag in the @xmath24 band to gain s / n @xmath25 10 for the continuum detection .    using the above criteria",
    ", we constructed a sample of 108 nearby , bright agns that are culled from the three different agn source catalogs below .",
    "the first source of the sample is a catalog of 35 bright and nearby type-1 agns with @xmath15 values measured from the reverberation mapping method @xcite .",
    "the reverberation mapping method provides the reference @xmath15 values , which are used as the basis for deriving @xmath15 estimators using spectra taken at a single - epoch . among the reverberation mapping sample ,",
    "31 agns were observed before @xmath3 stopped its operation in 2011 .",
    "note that two objects among these 31 agns , 3c273 and ngc7469 , were observed through another @xmath3 mission program ( agnul ; pi : takao nakagawa ) .",
    "the agns that are selected from the reverberation mapping sample have a wide range of @xmath15 values , @xmath26@xmath27 , and they are at @xmath28  0.29 . the second source is the pg qso catalog @xcite , since pg qsos are optically very bright and have been extensively studied in previous works @xcite .",
    "we find 69 pg qsos at @xmath29  0.48 to satisfy our selection criteria , excluding those that are already included in the reverberation mapping sample . among them , 48 were observed by @xmath3 . for their @xmath15 values , we use the values derived from the h@xmath4 line as listed in @xcite where the @xmath15 values span the range of @xmath30@xmath31 . finally , we also supplement the sample by four nearby bright quasars from seoul national university quasar survey in optical ( snuqso ; @xcite ) .",
    "snuqso is a survey of bright quasars missed by previous quasar survey at high and low galactic latitude ( b @xmath32 ) , and it provides additional bright qsos to the sample . in total , 108 bright ,",
    "low - redshift qsos are selected , of which 83 were observed by @xmath3    figures 1 and 2 show the basic characteristics of the sample .",
    "agns in our sample are located at a redshift range of @xmath28  0.48 , and span over a wide range of @xmath15 ( @xmath26@xmath31 ) , bolometric luminosity ( @xmath33 ; @xmath34@xmath35 ) and accretion rate ( -2.35@xmath36 @xmath37(eddington ratio ) @xmath360.43 ) .",
    "the @xmath33 values of the pg qsos and reverberation - mapped agns are estimated from @xmath19 using a bolometric correction factor of 10.3 @xcite , and their @xmath19 values are taken from @xcite .",
    "for snuqsos , the h@xmath5 luminosity from @xcite is converted to @xmath19 using equation ( 1 ) of @xcite , and the converted @xmath19 is translated to @xmath33 with a correction factor of 10.3 .",
    "all of the objects observed by @xmath3 in our sample and their basic properties are presented in table 1 .",
    "we note that the @xmath15 values in table 1 are calculated with a recently updated virial factor of 5.1 @xcite .",
    "-band magnitude of our agns where the meaning of the colors is identical to the top panel .",
    "the @xmath24-band magnitudes include the host galaxy light .",
    "note that pg qsos are about two magnitude fainter than the reverberation mapped agns in apparent magnitude since they are in general at higher redshifts.,title=\"fig : \" ] +      the 2.55.0@xmath0 m nir spectra were obtained with the irc infrared spectrograph @xcite on the @xmath3 satellite during phase 3 of the @xmath3 operation @xcite , i.e. , our observation was carried out during 20082011 after the helium cooling was over .",
    "we used the ng grism mode which provides a spectral resolution of @xmath38 .",
    "the spectral resolution corresponds to the fwhm velocity resolution of 2500 @xmath39 or @xmath40 at 3.6@xmath0 m which is adequate for studying the broad emission lines of quasars and agns whose typical fwhm velocity widths are greater than 2000 @xmath39 .",
    "also , the wavelength coverage of 2.55.0@xmath0 m enables us to sample br@xmath4 , br@xmath5 , and pah at low redshift .    for most of the targets , three - pointing observation was performed where one - pointing observation is made of seven to nine frames with 44 s of exposure each . for a few sources , 1 , 2 , or 5 pointings were assigned ( total integration time of 396 to 1848 seconds ) due to the observational constraints of the telescope .",
    "each target was placed at the center of a square - shaped slit window ( 10 @xmath41 10 size ) designed to avoid confusing the spectrum with neighboring objects .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observation of each target .",
    "+     +      the data reduction was performed using the standard data reduction software package `` irc spectroscopy toolkit for phase 3 data version 20110301 ( 2011/03/01 ) '' @xcite , but with an additional procedure for cosmic ray / hot pixel removal to improve quality of the final spectrum .",
    "first , we used the standard irc pipeline on each pointing data separately , up to the point before the extraction of the one - dimensional spectrum . then , we removed hot or bad pixels in the stacked two - dimensional spectrum using l.a.cosmic @xcite in spectroscopic mode , since the @xmath3 phase 3 images typically come with many hot pixels and we wanted to remove effectively the hot pixels .",
    "we set the hot or bad pixel detection limit to 4.5@xmath42 for removal of the hot pixels .",
    "then , a one - dimensional spectrum of each pointing for each object was extracted using an extraction aperture width of 5 pixels , for which aperture correction is performed using the pipeline and assuming a point source psf to correct for the missing flux due to the adoption of the finite aperture size .",
    "the extraction aperture width gives the optimal s / n since the fwhm of psfs in the irc data is about 5 pixels ( 73 ) .",
    "note that the agn spectrum can be contaminated by the host galaxy light , since the square - shaped slit window ( 10 ) does not completely block the light from the extended regions of a host galaxy .",
    "hence , we are effectively sampling the light from the agn@xmath43host galaxy within an observational rectangular aperture of 73 @xmath41 10 , which corresponds to physical scales of 1.49 kpc @xmath41 12.3 kpc at @xmath44 and 32.5 kpc @xmath41 267 kpc at @xmath45 where the long axis runs along the dispersion direction . in both cases ,",
    "the aperture contains a significant portion of host galaxies , although we expect that the measured brackett lines are dominated by emission from the nuclear region , as we describe in section 4.1 .",
    "finally , the extracted one - dimensional spectra from all of the pointings of a source were combined . in this process ,",
    "any remaining outlier pixels ( hot or bad pixel features ) in the one - dimensional spectrum were removed by @xmath42 clipping with 4.5@xmath42 where the median value and the @xmath42 of a data point were determined including two adjacent data points .",
    "the wavelength and flux calibration was performed in the irc pipeline and the expected accuracies of the wavelengths and fluxes are about 0.01@xmath0 m and 10% @xcite , respectively .    to demonstrate the accuracy of the photometric calibration",
    ", we compare the fluxes of pg qsos from the @xmath3 spectra to @xmath6 @xmath461 and @xmath47 irac @xmath481 magnitudes . to simplify the comparison , we restrict the sample for the comparison to point - like sources ( i.e. , unresolved ) in all of the @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath47 images .",
    "thus , we restrict the sample for the photometry comparison to those in the pg qso sample .",
    "for this comparison , we used the @xmath6 @xmath461 magnitudes measured with a profile - fitting method provided by the @xmath6 all - sky source catalog .",
    "however , for the @xmath47 irac @xmath481 magnitudes , we measured the magnitudes using irac @xmath481 pbcd imaging data that we obtained from the @xmath47 archive . in order to measure the magnitudes from the irac @xmath481 pbcd imaging data",
    ", we used the iraf daophot task with an aperture radius of 3@xmath41fwhm . among the pg qsos , five objects ( pg0007@xmath43106 , pg0050@xmath43124 , pg1100@xmath43772 , pg1501@xmath43106 , and pg1704@xmath43608 ) have irac @xmath481 pbcd imaging data . excluding pg0050@xmath43124 which is too bright and saturated at the center of the irac image",
    ", we used four objects from the @xmath47 archive for the comparison .",
    "finally , using @xmath3 spectra , we calculated the corresponding @xmath6 @xmath461 and @xmath47 @xmath481 magnitudes by applying appropriate filter transmission curves . figure 3 shows the comparison of the fluxes from @xmath3 with those from @xmath6 and @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath3 fluxes are on average 10@xmath49 larger than the @xmath6 fluxes , while the @xmath47 @xmath501 fluxes are in good agreement with the @xmath3 flux values .",
    "although the reason for the systematic offset in the flux is not clear , we find the 10@xmath49 difference to be acceptable considering the general flux calibration uncertainty of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the flux errors of the spectra from the pipeline appear somewhat larger than the fluctuation of the data points ( e.g. , figure 7 ) . to check the flux error values from the pipeline , we used independent flux measurements derived from several pointing observations ( section 2.2 ) , and we checked the determined uncertainty of the flux at each wavelength by adopting the rms value of the flux measurements from each pointing data .",
    "we find that the error derived this way agrees with the @xmath3 pipeline result , suggesting that the @xmath3 pipeline error measurement reflects unknown fluctuations in the continuum level determination or sensitivity fluctuations of irc .      in an attempt to increase the s / ns of the agns without brackett line detections",
    ", we created a composite spectrum of the 48 pg qsos .",
    "the pg qsos are less affected by host galaxy contamination than the reverberation - mapped sample due to bright luminosity ( @xmath33 : @xmath51@xmath52 ; figure 2 ) .    to construct the composite spectrum , we stacked , deredshifted , and flux - calibrated spectra of pg qsos in logarithmic scale . considering pg qsos",

    "the paschen lines are identified in 5 objects .",
    "all of the brackett line detections come from the reverberation mapping sample whose members are brighter than the qsos in the other two samples",

    "the dashed lines indicate the wavelength range used for the continuum fitting . ]",
    "using the spectra we presented in the previous section , we measured the line fluxes and widths of brackett lines and used them to estimate the @xmath15 values and the physical conditions of the gas in blr . in this section",
    ", we will describe the measurements of the line fluxes and widths , present the brackett - line based @xmath15 estimators , and discuss the blr physical condition inferred from the line luminosity ratios of the nir hydrogen lines .",
    "+      in this subsection , we describe how the brackett lines are fitted to derive line fluxes and widths .",
    "the fitting of the lines starts with the identification of the line in the deredshifted spectra .",
    "as mentioned already in the previous section , we find br@xmath5 and br@xmath4 at @xmath55 in 9 and 7 agns , respectively .",
    "after the line identification , the continuum around the brackett lines were determined by fitting a linear function to both sides of each brackett line . although a nir spectrum of a quasar is dominated by the black body radiation from the hot part of the dust torus , the linear fit of the continuum should provide a reasonable approximation of the local continuum around each emission line @xcite .",
    "however , determining the best wavelength region for the continuum is not a simple task , because many molecular absorption or atomic emission lines exist around the brackett lines .",
    "such lines are @xmath13 ( 2.53 , 2.66 , 2.73 , 2.753.55@xmath0 m ) , [ ] ( 3.93@xmath0 m ) , @xmath14 ( 4.26@xmath0 m ) and co ( 4.67@xmath0 m ) .",
    "hence , we chose the continuum regions that are least affected by such lines .",
    "the wavelength regions adopted for the continuum determinations are listed in table 2 .    after continuum subtraction",
    ", we fit the brackett lines and molecular / atomic lines simultaneously .",
    "fitting of the molecular / atomic lines near the brackett lines is necessary , since the fitting of the brackett lines can be influenced by the presence of molecular / atomic lines such as the @xmath13 absorption lines at 2.53 and 2.66@xmath0 m ( for br@xmath4 ) , and the [ ] and @xmath58 gas line at 3.93 and 4.14.4@xmath0 m ( for br@xmath5 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows a 2.55.0@xmath0 m spectrum of ngc4151 , which includes br@xmath5 , br@xmath4 , @xmath13 , [ ] , and @xmath14 lines .",
    "the blue and red solid lines are the continuum levels used for the br@xmath4 and br@xmath5 emission line measurements .",
    "the region bracketed by the dashed lines indicates the wavelength range used for the continuum fitting of each brackett line .",
    "we used a single gaussian function to fit each line considering the low spectral resolution of the @xmath3 spectroscopy , setting the central wavelength , the line width , and the line flux to be free parameters . an interactive data language ( idl ) procedure , ` mpfitexpr ` @xcite , was used to fit the lines .",
    "the fit provides the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath42 , and fluxes of the brackett lines .",
    "note that the narrow emission line does not significantly affect the line flux and @xmath42 measurements . as a test",
    ", we set a model spectrum with a broad ( @xmath42 : 850  2500 @xmath39 ) and a narrow line component ( @xmath42 : 170 @xmath39 ) at the @xmath3 spectral resolution .",
    "we adopt the flux ratios of the narrow to broad component flux to be 0.115 and 0.227 for br@xmath4 and br@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "these ratios are derived by first taking a median h@xmath5 narrow / broad component flux ratio in @xcite for five objects ( mrk110 , mrk79 , ngc7469 , ngc4593 , and ngc4151 ) , and then converting the h@xmath5 flux to the brackett flux based on the computation from the cloudy code ( version 10.00 ; @xcite ) for the blr condition ( @xmath5 = -1.0 , @xmath59 = @xmath60 @xmath61 , and @xmath62 = @xmath63 ; @xcite ) and the narrow line condition ( @xmath59 = @xmath64 @xmath61 and @xmath62 = @xmath65 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we fitted the degraded model emission line with a single gaussian function . the measured flux and @xmath42 values are 108% ( 104  115% ) and 95% ( 90  98% ) compared to the original broad component properties , which would affect @xmath15 by a small amount , @xmath220.03 dex .",
    "it is also confirmed that the narrow emission lines in the nir do not affect the line flux and @xmath42 measurements as much ( @xmath66 ) in a relatively low - resolution spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .            for further analysis in the following subsections ,",
    "we exclude objects with substantial @xmath42 errors ( @xmath2560% of the measured @xmath42 value ) or measured brackett line fwhm ( 2.35@xmath42 ) less than the spectral resolution ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the excluded cases are mrk110 ( br@xmath4 ) and ark120 ( br@xmath5 ) .",
    "finally , eight br@xmath5 and seven br@xmath4 lines are selected and used for further investigation of the line properties .",
    "all of these are from the reverberation mapping sample , since the pg qsos are generally too faint for a reliable fitting of the lines ( e.g. , figure 1 ) .",
    "note that the selected brackett lines show a small systematic shift in the wavelength of @xmath67 @xmath68@xmath0 m ( @xmath69@xmath0 m and @xmath70@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the br@xmath5 and br@xmath4 lines are shifted by a similar amount in wavelength ( @xmath71 ) , suggesting that the wavelength shift applies to the entire spectral range . the shift is a bit larger than the expected wavelength offset error in the @xmath3 irc of 0.01@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the origin of the systematic offset is unclear , although it seems to be instrumental .",
    "a potential source of the offset is molecular / atomic absorption affecting the peak wavelength of the emission lines .",
    "however , if this were true , then we would expect a stronger offset in br@xmath5 than in br@xmath4 since br@xmath4 is generally much less affected by molecular absorption features than br@xmath5 , but this was not the case .",
    "the formal fitting errors are found to be about 27% ( between 7% and 49% ) in @xmath42 and 28% ( between 6% and 46% ) in flux , due to low s / n and the necessity of simultaneously fitting the other lines in the vicinity .",
    "another source of error comes from the determination of the continuum .",
    "we varied the wavelength regions for the continuum fit from the values noted in table 2 to see how strongly the changes in the continuum level affect the line fitting results .",
    "we find that the variation in the continuum level changes the derived @xmath42 and flux values by 13% and 8% respectively .",
    "overall , combining these two errors , we obtain the error in @xmath42 and flux to be 33% and 30% , which corresponds to 0.30 dex in @xmath15 .",
    "energy sources of the brackett lines could be bh activity or star formation activity .",
    "considering the large slit aperture of the irc and the extraction width we adopted , the measured brackett line fluxes may include the star formation contribution from the host galaxy . to determine the dominant energy source of the brackett lines",
    ", we compared the expected @xmath72 from star formation to the measured @xmath72 . the relationships @xmath73 @xcite and @xmath74 @xcite are expected for starburst galaxies , suggesting that the luminosity of the br@xmath5 line from star formation is 10% of the 3.3@xmath0 m pah line luminosity . among our seven br@xmath5-detected agns , the 3.3@xmath0 m pah emission line is detected in only two objects ( ngc4051 and ngc7469 ) using the extraction width adopted in this study ( kim et al . in prep ) .",
    "the expected star formation contributions of the br@xmath5 line based on the 3.3@xmath0 m pah line are 8% and 46% for ngc4051 and ngc7469 , respectively .",
    "this assumes the above 10% flux ratio of @xmath72 to @xmath75 , but the relation contains a large scatter of a factor of two to three .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the contribution of star formation to the bracket emission lines is negligible ( no or weak detection of pahs ) for most of the agns in our sample .",
    "ngc7469 is an exceptional case with a very strong 3.3@xmath0 m pah . even in this case ,",
    "the star formation contribution is less than half for br@xmath5 , but we caution possible over - estimation of the line flux ( 134% ) and under - estimation of the line width ( 80% ) for ngc7469 .",
    "the measured values of the @xmath42 and luminosities of the brackett lines and the corresponding h@xmath4 properties are presented in table 2 .",
    "note that the @xmath42 values are corrected for the instrumental resolution by subtracting the instrumental resolution in quadrature ( @xmath76 ) from the observed values .",

    "however , both @xmath15 estimators can potentially be applied to derive @xmath15 values of dusty agns due to the low extinction in the brackett line wavelengths . the continuum shape is well traced for all of the objects , and we derived the temperatures and luminosities of the hot and warm dust components of 19 luminous agns ( @xmath168 ) for which host galaxy contamination is expected to be small ( @xmath156 10% ) .",
    "the use of the @xmath3 spectra provides the advantage of tracing the nir continuum densely , thus improving the dust temperature measurements .",
    "our results show the hot dust temperature to be about @xmath169 , which is lower than the commonly cited value of 1500k but broadly consistent with most recent hot dust temperature measurements .",
    "the covering factor of the hot dust component is also derived with a mean @xmath164 of 0.38 , consistent with previous measurements . the @xmath3 spectral atlas and",
    "the tabulated spectral measurements can be downloaded from this article , revealing the rarely studied spectral range of 2.55.0@xmath0 m for low - redshift agns .",
