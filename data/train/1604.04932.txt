    "although gravitational waves were predicted by albert einstein in 1916 , to date their existence was shown only indirectly through the orbital changes of binary pulsar psr  b1913 + 16 .",
    "the first direct detection was done september 14 , 2015 by two laser interferometers ligo @xcite .",
    "form of the gw150914 signal corresponds to the prediction of general theory of relativity for the merge of two black holes with masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the statistical significance of the registration is @xmath3 .",
    "this result demonstrates the existence black holes in the binary systems .",
    "such black holes can born at the massive supernova explosions as a result of the standard stellar evolution @xcite , @xcite although the large masses provide some difficulties .",
    "it is possible , however , that the black holes were born in the collapse of massive pre - galactic stars , or they were formed by merge of smaller black holes in the dense star clusters .",
    "the alternative explanation of gw150914 is the merge of primordial black holes ( pbh ) in a pair @xcite .",
    "the possibility of pbh formation was predicted in @xcite , and the pbh pair can form occasionally if two pbh born sufficiently close to each other @xcite .",
    "the motion of the binary pbh is influenced by neighbouring third pbh , therefore the pbhs do not move exactly towards each other but experience tangential displacement under the influence of tidal gravitational forces from the third pbh .",
    "the @xcite discussed the machos with masses @xmath4 , while @xcite explained the signal gw150914 by the merge of pbhs with masses @xmath5 .",
    "the gw150914 provides some difficulty for the standard theory of stellar evolution , so the pbh can serve as an alternative explanation .",
    "in addition , the possibility of the pbhs clusters formation in the early universe was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the pbhs collisions in such clusters may produce bursts of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "in this study we consider the additional source of tidal forces  the tidal forces from the usual inflationary density perturbations in dark matter .",
    "this effect was not considered previously in the calculations of the pbhs pair evolution .",
    "these tidal forces alter the distribution of pbhs pairs over their orbital parameters , and it leads finally to the gravitational bursts suppression by about one order of magnitude .",
    "the close pbhs pair formed already at the cosmological stage of the radiation dominance ( rd ) , but they can also form later at the stage of matter domination . a halo of dark matter is accumulated around the pbh by the secondary accretion mechanism @xcite .",
    "the pbhs in the halo experience the dynamic friction , lose angular momentum and move toward the center , there they form the gravitationally bounded binary , even if they were not associated initially @xcite .",
    "the further fate of this pair is uncertain , because the effectiveness of dynamic friction in this situation was not investigated .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the section  [ label ]",
    "we mainly define the notations and repeat some calculations of @xcite by other method .",
    "section  [ label ] is devoted to the new effect  the tidal forces from adiabatic density perturbations with cmb - normalised spectrum .",
    "then we calculate the resultant rate of the gravitational bursts in the section  [ ratesec ] . in the section  [ dmsec ]",
    "we consider critically the possibility of the pbhs merge inside dark matter minihalos . and finally we present some conclusions in the section  [ conclsec ] .",

    "according to @xcite the semi - major axis of orbit is fixed at the time given by ( [ amexpr ] ) , and the minor axis is influenced by tidal forces from the third pbh , located at the comoving distance @xmath22 .",

    "the distance of each pbh from the center of masses is @xmath28 .",

    "we obtain the characteristic time of the fall to the center @xmath119 pbhs come to the radius @xmath31 , within which the mass of dark matter is @xmath120 , and the pbhs sit on the orbit around each other .",
    "dark matter within their orbit and the surrounding material will lead to the evolution of the orbit , but the effectiveness of dynamical friction under these conditions has not been elucidated yet and requires further investigation .",
    "the lifetime of the pair ( [ tc ] ) is many orders of magnitude greater than the age of the universe @xmath94 , therefore , for the further approach and merger the pbhs must continue to lose the orbital angular momenta .",
