    "the evolution of the cellular network generations is influenced primarily by continuous growth in wireless user devices , data usage , and the need for a better quality of experience ( qoe ) .",
    "more than 50 billion connected devices are expected to utilize the cellular network services by the end of the year 2020  @xcite , which would result in a tremendous increase in data traffic , as compared to the year 2014  @xcite",
    ". however , state - of - the - art solutions are not sufficient for the challenges mentioned above . in short , the increase of 3d (  device , ",
    "data , and  data transfer rate ) encourages the development of 5 g networks .",
    "specifically , the fifth generation ( 5 g ) of the cellular networks will highlight and address the following three broad views : ( _ i _ ) user - centric ( by providing 24@xmath07 device connectivity , uninterrupted communication services , and a smooth consumer experience ) , ( _ ii _ ) service - provider - centric ( by providing a connected intelligent transportation systems , road - side service units , sensors , and mission critical monitoring / tracking services ) , and ( _ iii _ ) network - operator - centric ( by providing an energy - efficient , scalable , low - cost , uniformly - monitored , programmable , and secure communication infrastructure ) .",
    "therefore , 5 g networks are perceived to realize the three main features as below :    * _ ubiquitous connectivity _ : in future , many types of devices will connect ubiquitously and provide an uninterrupted user experience .",
    "in fact , the user - centric view will be realized by ubiquitous connectivity .",
    "* _ zero latency _ : the 5 g networks will support life - critical systems , real - time applications , and services with zero delay tolerance .",
    "hence , it is envisioned that 5 g networks will realize zero latency , _",
    "i_._e_. , extremely low latency of the order of 1 millisecond  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the service - provider - centric view will be realized by the zero latency . * _ high - speed gigabit connection _ : the zero latency property could be achieved using a high - speed connection for fast data transmission and reception , which will be of the order of gigabits per second to users and machines  @xcite .",
    "a few more _ key features of 5 g networks _ are enlisted and compared to the fourth generation ( 4 g ) of the cellular networks , as below  @xcite : ( _ i _ ) 10-@xmath1 number of connected devices , ( _ ii _ ) 1000@xmath2 higher mobile data volume per area , ( _ iii _ ) 10-@xmath1 higher data rate , ( _ iv _ ) 1 millisecond latency , ( _ v _ ) 99.99% availability , ( _ vi _ ) 100% coverage , ( _ vii _ ) @xmath3 energy consumption as compared to the year 2010 , ( _ viii _ ) real - time information processing and transmission , ( _ ix _ ) @xmath4 network management operation expenses , and ( _ x _ ) seamless integration of the current wireless technologies .",
    "r9 cm        [ fig : circle ]    the revolutionary scope and the consequent advantages of the envisioned 5 g networks , therefore , demand new architectures , methodologies , and technologies ( see figure  [ fig : circle ] ) , _ e_._g_. , energy - efficient heterogeneous frameworks , cloud - based communication ( software - defined networks ( sdn ) and network function virtualization ( nfv ) ) , full duplex radio , self - interference cancellation ( sic ) , device - to - device ( d2d ) communications , machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communications , access protocols , cheap devices , cognitive networks ( for accessing licensed , unlicensed , and shared frequency bands ) , dense - deployment , security - privacy protocols for communication and data transfer , backhaul connections , massive multiple - input and multiple - output ( mmimo ) , multi - radio access technology ( rat ) architectures , and technologies for working on millimeter wave ( mmwave ) 30300 ghz .",
    "interestingly , the 5 g networks will not be a mere enhancement of 4 g networks in terms of additional capacity ; they will encompass a system architecture visualization , conceptualization , and redesigning at every communication layer  @xcite .",
    "several industries , _ e_._g_. , alcatel - lucent  @xcite , docomo  @xcite , gsma intelligence  @xcite , huawei  @xcite , nokia siemens networks  @xcite , qualcomm  @xcite , samsung  @xcite , vodafone , the european commission supported 5 g infrastructure public private partnership ( 5gppp )  @xcite , and mobile and wireless communications enablers for the twenty - twenty information society ( metis )  @xcite , are brainstorming with the development of 5 g networks .",
    "currently , the industry standards are yet to be evolved about the expected designs and architectures for 5 g networks .",
    "* scope of the paper .",
    "* in this paper , we will review the vision of the 5 g networks , advantages , applications , proposed architectures , implementation issues , real demonstrations , and testbeds .",

    "we would like to emphasize that there do exist some review works on 5 g networks by andrews et al .",
    "@xcite , chvez - santiago et al .",
    "@xcite , and gavrilovska et al .",
    "@xcite , to the best of our knowledge . however , our perspective about 5 g networks is different , as we deal with a variety of architectures and discuss several implementation affairs , technologies in 5 g networks along with applications and real - testbed demonstrations .",
    "in addition , we intentionally avoid an mmwave oriented discussion in this paper , unlike the current work  @xcite .",
    "we encourage our readers to see an overview about the generations of the cellular networks ( see table  [ table : the generation of cellular networks ] ) and the crucial limitations of current cellular networks in the next section .",
    ".the generations of the cellular networks . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     wang et al .",
    "@xcite suggested a way for separating indoor and outdoor users and using a _ mobile small - cell _ on a train or a bus . for separating indoor and outdoor users",
    ", a mbs holds large antenna arrays with some antenna elements distributed around the macrocell and connected to the mbs using optical fibers . a sbs and large antenna arrays are deployed in each building for communicating with the mbs .",
    "all ues inside a building can have a connection to another ue either through the sbs or by using wifi , mmwave , or vlc .",
    "thus , the separation of users results in less load on a mbs .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite also suggested to use a mobile small - cell that is located inside a vehicle to allow communication among internal ues , while large antenna arrays are located outside the vehicle to communicate with a mbs .",
    "thus , all the ues inside a vehicle ( or a building ) appear to be a single unit with respect to the corresponding mbs , and clearly , the sbs appears as a mbs to all these ues .    in  @xcite ,",
    "a two - tier architecture is deployed as a process of _ network densification _ that is a combination of _ spatial densification _ ( increasing the number of antennas per ue and mbs , and increasing the density of bss ) and _ spectral aggregation _ ( using higher frequency bands @xmath5 3 ghz ) .",
    "a tradeoff between the transmission power of a macrocell and the coverage area of small - cells is presented in  @xcite ; _",
    "i_._e_. , on the one hand , if the transmission power of a macrocell is high , then many adjacent ues to a small - cell may find themselves in the service area of the macrocell , and hence , it will decrease the coverage area of that small - cell . on the other hand , if the transmission power of a macrocell is low , then the coverage area of the small - cell will increase .",
    "therefore , _ cell range expansion _",
    "( _ i_._e_. , a biased handoff in the favor of small - cells ) is carried out to serve more ues by small - cells to which they are closer .",
    "moreover , sbss , deployed in offices or homes , can be used to serve outdoor users , _",
    "e_._g_. , pedestrians and low - mobility vehicles , in their neighborhoods , and the approach is called _ indoor - to - outdoor user service _  @xcite .",
    "hossain et al .",
    "@xcite presented a multi - tier architecture consisting of several types of small - cells , relays , and d2d communication for serving users with different qos requirements in spectrum - efficient and energy - efficient manners .",
    "interestingly , all of these architectures consider that ues spontaneously discover a sbs .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a centralized system in which a mbs assists ues to have connections to particular sbss , thereby interference between ues and sbss is reduced . however , this approach overburdens the mbs .",
    "* advantage of the deployment of small - cells . *    * _ high data rate and efficient spectrum use _ : the small physical separation between a sbs and ues ( served by the same sbs ) leads to a higher data rate and a better indoor coverage . also , the spectrum efficiency increases due to fewer ues in direct communication with a mbs  @xcite . *",
    "_ energy saving _ :",
    "the use of small - cells reduces the energy consumption of the network ( by not involving mbss ) and of ues ( by allowing ues to communicate at a shorter range with low signaling overhead )  @xcite . *",
    "_ money saving _ : it is more economical to install a sbs without any cumbersome planning as compared to a mbs , and also the operational - management cost is much lower than the cost associated with a mbs  @xcite .",
    "* the plug - and - play utility of small - cells boosts the on - demand network capacity  @xcite . * _ less congestion to a mbs _ : sbss offload ues from a mbs so that the mbs is lightly loaded and less congested , and hence , improve the system capacity  @xcite . * _ easy handoff _ : mobile small - cells also follow the advantages of small - cells . moreover , they provide an attractive solution to highly mobile ues by reducing handoff time overheads , since a mobile small - cell is capable to do the handoff on behalf of all related ues  @xcite .",
    "* disadvantage of small - cells . * despite numerous prominent benefits as mentioned above , there are a few realistic issues such as implementation cost and operational reliability .",
    "the small - cells indeed impose an initial cost to the infrastructure , but less than the cost associated with a mbs .",
    "moreover , a frequent authentication is mandatory due to frequent handoff operations .",
    "further , an active or passive ( on / off ) state update of any small - cell would definitely result in frequent topological updates .    * open issues in the deployment of 2-tier architectures using small - cells . *    * _ interference management _ : the deployment of small - cells results in several types of interferences , as : _ inter - tier interference _ ( _ i_._e_. , interference from a mbs to a sbs , interference from a mbs to a sbs s ues , and interference from a sbs to a mbs s ues ) , and _ intra - tier interference _ ( _ i_._e_. , interference from a sbs to other sbss ues ) .",
    "hence , it is also required to develop models and algorithms to handle these interferences  @xcite . *",
    "_ backhaul data transfer _ : though we have models to transfer data from a sbs to the core network , which we will discuss next in section  [ subsubsec : backhaul data transfer from small - cells ] , an extremely dense - deployment of small - cells requires a huge amount of data transfer , and certainly , requires cost efficient architectures .",
    "data transfer from a sbs to the core network is a challenging task , and in general , there may be three approaches to transfer ( backhaul ) data to the core network , as follows :    * _ wired optical fiber _ : by establishing a wired optical fiber link from each sbs to a mbs ; however , it is time - consuming and expensive .",
    "* _ wireless point - to - multipoint _ ( ptmp ) : by deploying a ptmp - bs at a mbs that communicates with sbss and transfers data to the core network",
    ". * _ wireless point - to - point _ ( ptp ) : by using directional antennas in line - of - sight ( los ) environments ; hence , it provides high capacity ptp links ( same as with wired optical fibers ) , at a significantly lower cost .",
    "ge et al .",
    "@xcite presented two architectures based on the wireless ptmp approach . in the first ( centralized ) architecture ,",
    "all sbss send data using mmwave to a mbs that eventually aggregates the received data and forwards the same to the core network using fiber . in the second ( distributed ) architecture , all small - cells cooperatively forward data using mmwave to a specified sbs that transfers data to the core network using fiber without the explicit involvement of a mbs .",
    "ni et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an _ adaptive backhaul architecture _ based on the wireless ptp approach and frequency division duplex for ul and dl channels .",
    "a tree structure is used , where the root node is connected to the core network using fiber , the leaf nodes represent ues , and other nodes represent sbss .",
    "the data is transferred from the leaf nodes to the root node that transfers the same to the core network .",
    "the bandwidth is selected dynamically for backhaul links , as per the current bandwidth requirements , interference conditions , and the network topology .",
    "a similar approach is also presented in  @xcite .",
    "an automatic detection and recovery of a failed cell is an important issue in densely deployed multi - tier architectures .",
    "wang and zhang  @xcite provided three approaches for designing a self - healing architecture such as below :    1 .",
    "_ centralized approach _ : a dedicated server is responsible for detecting a failed cell by measuring and analyzing abnormal behavior of users , _",
    "e_._g_. , received signal strengths ( rsss ) at users and handoff by several users at any time from a particular cell .",
    "the server collects global information and reconfigures the failed cell .",
    "however , the approach suffers with a high communication overhead and a high computational cost .",
    "2 .   _ distributed approach _ :",
    "each sbs detects failed small - cells in neighborhoods by measuring and analyzing users handoff behavior and the neighboring small - cells signals .",
    "consequently , on detecting a failed cell , a sbs might increase the transmission power in order to incorporate users of the failed cell .",
    "however , the approach might not work efficiently in case that users are scattered sparsely .",
    "3 .   _ local cooperative or hybrid approach _ : this approach combines the benefits of both the previous approaches , and therefore , minimizes the drawback . essentially , two steps are utilized , namely distributed trigger and cooperative detection . in the distributed trigger ,",
    "each sbs collects information about users behavior .",
    "subsequently , a trigger message is sent to a dedicated server in case the received information thrives below a certain threshold .",
    "hence , it does not require communication among small - cells . in the cooperative detection",
    ", the dedicated server takes the final decision based on the information received from several small - cells , resulting in a high accuracy and lower latency .      a cognitive radio network ( crn )",
    "@xcite is a collection of cognitive radio nodes ( or processors ) , called secondary users ( sus ) that exploit the existing spectrum opportunistically .",
    "the sus have the _ leira _ ( learning , efficiency , intelligence , reliability , and adaptively ) property for scanning and operating on multiple heterogeneous channels ( or frequency bands ) in the absence of the licensed user(s ) , termed as primary user(s ) ( pus ) , of the respective bands  @xcite .",
    "each pu has a fixed bandwidth , high transmit power , and high reliability ; however , the sus work on a broad range of bandwidth with low transmit power and low reliability .",
    "a crn in 5 g networks is used for designing multi - tier architectures , removing interference among cells , and minimizing energy consumption in the network  @xcite .",
    "a crn creates a 2-tier architecture , similar to architectures discussed in section  [ subsec : two - tier architectures ] ; however , it is assumed that either a mbs or a sbs has cognitive properties for working on different channels .",
    "hong et al .",
    "@xcite presented two types of crn - based architectures for 5 g networks , as : ( _ i _ ) non - cooperative and ( _ ii _ ) cooperative crns .",
    "the _ non - cooperative crn _ establishes a multi - rats system , having two separate radio interfaces that operate at the licensed and temporary unoccupied channels by pus , called cognitive channels .",
    "the sus work only on cognitive channels and form a crn , which overlays on the existing licensed cellular network .",
    "the two networks can be integrated in the upper layers while must be separated in the physical layer .",
    "this architecture can be used in different manners , as : ( _ i _ ) the cognitive and licensed channels are used by users near a mbs and users far away from the mbs , respectively , ( _ ii _ ) the cognitive and licensed channels are used for relaxed qos and strict qos , respectively .",
    "the _ cooperative crn _ uses only a licensed channel , where sus access the channel in an opportunistic fashion when the pu of the channel is absent .",
    "this architecture can be used in different manners , as : ( _ i _ ) a sbs communicates with a mbs using the licensed channel and provides service to its ues via an opportunistic access to the licensed frequency band , ( _ ii _ ) a licensed channel is used to serve ues by a sbs and the opportunistic access to the licensed channel is used to transfer backhaul data to the mbs .    in short , the cooperative crn  @xcite provides a real intuition of incorporating crns in 5 g networks , where a sbs works as a su , which scans activities of a macrocell and works on temporarily unoccupied frequency bands ( known as _ spectrum holes _",
    "@xcite ) by a pu to provide services to their ues with minimally disrupting macrocell activities .",
    "a dynamic pricing model based on a game theoretic framework for cognitive small - cells is suggested in  @xcite . since in reality",
    "sbss operators and mbss operators may not be identical and small - cells ues may achieve a higher data rate as compared to macrocells ues , the pricing model for both ues must be different .",
    "huang et al .",
    "@xcite provided an approach for avoiding inter - tier interference by integrating a _ cognitive technique _ at a sbs .",
    "the cognitive technique consists of three components , as : ( _ i _ ) a cognitive module , which senses the environment and collects information about spectrum holes , collision probability , qos requirements , macrocell activities , and channel gains , ( _ ii _ ) a cognitive engine , which analyzes and stores the collected information for estimating available resources , and ( _ iii _ ) a self - configuration module , which uses the stored information for dynamically optimizing several parameters for efficient handoff , interference , and power management .",
    "further , the channel allocation to a small - cell is done in a manner to avoid inter - tier and intra - tier interferences , based on gale - shapley  @xcite spectrum sharing scheme , which avoids collisions by not assigning an identical channel to neighboring small - cells .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite suggested an approach for mitigating inter - tier interference based on spectrum sensing , spectrum sharing , and cognitive relay , where links between a mbs and its ues are considered as pus and links between a sbs and its ues are considered as sus .",
    "cognitive techniques are used for detecting interference from a mbs to a sbs and vice versa , and a path loss estimation algorithm is provided for detecting interference from a small - cell s ues to a macrocell s ues . after detecting inter - tier interference , a small - cell shares spectrum with a macrocell using either _ overlay spectrum sharing scheme _ ( _ i_._e_. , sus utilize unoccupied channels , and it is applicable when a mbs and a sbs s ues are very close or no interference is required by a macrocell s ues ) or _ underlay spectrum sharing scheme _",
    "( _ i_._e_. , sus and pus transmit on an identical channel while restricting transmit power of sus , and hence , resulting in a higher spectrum utilization ) .    note",
    "that a crn can be used to support d2d communication and mitigate interferences caused by d2d communication , which we will see in section  [ subsec : device - to - device communication architectures ] .    * advantages of crns in 5 g networks .",
    "*    * _ minimizing interference _ : by implementing a crn at small - cells , cognitive small - cells can avoid interference very efficiently by not selecting identical channels as the channels of neighboring small - cells . * _ increase network capacity _ : the spectrum holes can be exploited for supporting a higher data transfer rate and enhancing bandwidth utilization  @xcite .",
    "* open issues . *",
    "usually , cellular networks are not energy - efficient as they consume energy in circuits , cooling systems , and also radiate in air .",
    "hence , an energy - efficient deployment of a crn in a cellular network is of utmost importance  @xcite .",
    "further , there is a tradeoff between the spatial frequency reuse and the outage probability , which requires the selection of an efficient spectrum sensing algorithm  @xcite .",
    "device - to - device ( d2d ) communication allows close proximity ues to communicate with each other on a licensed cellular bandwidth without involving a mbs or with a very controlled involvement of a mbs .",

    "we have reviewed some of the methodologies and technologies in the previous sections , such as : ( _ i _ ) full duplex radios in sections  [ section : challenges in the development of 5 g ] and  [ subsec : interference management in 5 g networks ] , ( _ ii _ ) crns in section  [ subsec : cognitive radio network based architectures ] , ( _ iii _ ) d2d communication in section  [ subsec : device - to - device communication architectures ] , ( _ iv _ ) multi - tier heterogeneous deployment or dense - deployment techniques in sections  [ subsec : two - tier architectures ] ,  [ subsec : cognitive radio network based architectures ] , and  [ subsec : device - to - device communication architectures ] , ( _ v _ ) c - rans in section  [ subsec : cloud - based architectures ] , ( _ vi _ ) ` green ' communication systems in section  [ subsec : energy - efficient architectures for 5 g networks ] , and ( _ vii _ ) techniques related to interference , qos , handoff , channel access , load balancing in section  [ sec : management issues in 5 g networks ] .    in this section , we will briefly describe some techniques that are mentioned but not explained in earlier sections .",
    "* self - interference cancellation ( sic ) .",
    "* when a full duplex radio receives signals from another radio , it also receives interference signals by its own transmission , resulting in self - interference .",
    "hence , a full duplex radio has to implement techniques to cancel self - interference  @xcite .",
    "sic techniques are classified into passive and active cancellations ; see  @xcite . as advantages ,",
    "the implementation of sic enables seamless global roaming , high - throughput services , and low - latency applications in a cost effective manner  @xcite .",
    "* downlink and uplink decoupling ( dud ) .",
    "* in the current cellular networks , a ue is associated with a bs based on the received signal power in its dl channel , and then , uses the same bs for ul channel transmission  @xcite .",
    "dud allows a ue to select a dl channel and a ul channel from two different bss , based on the link quality , the cell load , and the cell backhaul capacity  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a ue may have the dl channel connected through a bs and the ul channel connected through a different bs , resulting in a user - centric 5 g architecture  @xcite and improving the capacity of ul channels , which is a prime concern .",
    "* network function virtualization ( nfv ) . *",
    "nfv  @xcite implements network functions such as network address translation , firewalls , intrusion detection , domain name service , the traffic load management , and caching through software running on commodity servers .",
    "however , the conventional networks implement these functions on dedicated and application specific servers .",
    "hence , nfv decreases the burden on network operators by not updating dedicated servers / hardware , thereby saves cost .",
    "* software - defined networking ( sdn ) . * sdn architectures  @xcite partition network control functions and data forwarding functions , thereby the network control functions are programmable , and the network infrastructure handles applications and network services .",
    "sdn architectures can be divided into three parts , as : ( _ i _ ) _ the software controller _ : holds network control functions such as the network manager , apis , network operating system , and maintaining the global view of the network ; ( _ ii _ ) _ the southbound part _ : provides an interface and a protocol between the controller and sdn - enable infrastructure , where openflow  @xcite is the most famous protocol that provides communication between the controller and the southbound part ; ( _ iii _ ) _ the northbound part _ : provides an interface between sdn applications and the controller  @xcite .",
    "interested readers may refer to  @xcite to find details of sdn , challenges in sdn , and applications of sdn .",
    "note that sdn , nfv , and c - rans offload functionalities to software running on commodity servers .",
    "however , sdn separates network control functions from data forwarding functions , while nfv implements network functions in software  @xcite . besides that c - rans integrate both sdn and nfv to meet the scalability and flexibility requirements in the future mobile networks  @xcite .    * millimeter waves ( mmwave ) . *",
    "the current wireless bandwidth is not able to support a huge number of ues in 5 g networks .",
    "hence , researchers are looking at 30 ghz to 300 ghz frequency bands , where mmwave communication is proposed for achieving high - speed data transfer .",
    "the current research focuses on 28 ghz band , 38 ghz band , 60 ghz band , and the e - band ( 7176 ghz and 8186 ghz )  @xcite .",
    "however , mmwave has several challenges at the physical , mac , and network layers .",
    "there are a number of papers about mmwave , and hence , we are not discussing mmwave in details .",
    "interested readers may refer to  @xcite .    * machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communication . *",
    "m2 m communication refers to the communication between ( network ) devices ( _ e_._g_. , sensors / monitoring - devices with a cloud ) without human intervention .",
    "some examples of m2 m communication are intelligent transport systems , health measurement , monitoring of buildings , gas and oil pipelines , intelligent retail systems , and security and safety systems .",
    "however , the development of m2 m communication involves several challenges to be handled in the future , as follows : connectivity of massive devices , bursty data , the zero latency , scalability in terms of supporting devices , technologies and diverse applications , fast and reliable delivery of messages , and cost of devices .",
    "in addition , the development of efficient algorithms for location , time , group , priority , and multi - hop data transmission management for m2 m communication is needed  @xcite .",
    "interested readers may refer to  @xcite .",
    "* massive mimo ( mmimo ) .",
    "* mmimo systems are also known as large - scale antenna systems , very large mimo , hyper - mimo , and full - dimension mimo  @xcite .",
    "mmimo systems use antenna arrays with hundreds of antennas at mbs for simultaneously serving many ues with a single antenna in identical time and frequency .",
    "hence , expensive equipment are mounted on a mbs  @xcite .",
    "a mmimo system relies on spatial multiplexing , which in turn relies on the channel knowledge at mbs , on both ul and dl channels .",
    "a mmimo system reduces latency and energy , simplifies the mac layer , shows robustness against intentional jamming , and increases the capacity due to spatial multiplexing .    * visual light communication ( vlc ) .",
    "* vlc is a high - speed data transfer medium for short range los optical links in the future cellular networks  @xcite .",
    "the light - emitting diodes ( leds ) provide vlc using amplitude modulation at higher frequencies and achieve higher data rates while keeping the led s primary illumination function unaffected .",
    "vlc can be used for outdoor applications , where high power laser - based equipment provide transmission links , and for indoor application , where leds provide short distance transmission links .",
    "vlc is an energy - efficient technology , works on a wider range of unregulated frequency bands , shows high spatial reuse , and inherits security due to los .",
    "however , vlc is sensitive to sunlight and not able to work for a long range without los , and hence , confined coverage  @xcite .",
    "the implementation of vlc has still some unanswered questions , such as : how vlc will work in a long range without los and will it work for backhaul data transfer in multihop ?    * fast caching .",
    "* caching is a way for storing temporary data for reducing data access from slow memory or the network . in a network ,",
    "content caching is popular and answers the request while responding in place of the application servers as a proxy , thereby reducing the amount of hits that are directly sent to the ultimate backend server .",
    "in caching , three decisions are prominent as : what to cache , where to cache , and how to cache ?",
    "the authors  @xcite suggested that ues will have enough memory in the future , and they can work as a cache for any other ue , since a small amount of popular data requires to be cached .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite provided a caching mechanism based content centric networking ( ccn ) , assuming 5 g networks will include ccn - capable gateways , routers , and mbss .",
    "ccn provides in - network data storage , also known as _",
    "universal caching _ , at every node in the network .",
    "the cached data is uniquely identified at each node .",
    "accordingly , a user can request for a particular content from the content cache of any device within the network , or the request is forwarded to the actual source of content storage .",
    "interested readers may refer to  @xcite for finding details about some of the above mentioned methodologies and technologies .",
    "the zero latency , high speed data transfer , and ubiquitous connectivity are the salient features of 5 g networks that are expected to serve a wide range of applications and services . in this section",
    ", we enumerate the most prominent applications of 5 g networks , as follows :    * personal usages . *",
    "this domain of 5 g networks would be capable of supporting a wide range of ues , from scalable to heterogeneous devices . also the data demands ( _ e_._g_. , multimedia data , voice communication , and web surfing ) , would be satisfied while keeping the qos requirements",
    ".    * virtualized homes . * due to c - ran architectures , users may have only low cost ues ( _ e_._g_. , set - top box for tvs and residential gateways for accessing the internet ) with services of the physical and data link layers .",
    "all the other higher layers applications may move to the cloud for universal access and outsourced computation services  @xcite .",
    "* smart societies .",
    "* it is an abstract term for connected virtualized homes , offices , and stores .",
    "accordingly , every digital and electronic services / appliances , _",
    "e_._g_. , temperature maintenance , warning alarms , printers , lcds , air conditioners , physical workout equipment , and door locks , would be interconnected in a way that the collaborative actions would enhance the user experience .",
    "similarly , smart stores would assist in filtering out irrelevant product details , sale advertisements , and item suggestions on the go .",
    "* smart grids .",
    "* the smart grids would decentralize the energy distribution and better analyze the energy consumption .",
    "this would allow the smart grids to improve efficiency and economic benefits .",
    "the 5 g networks would allow a rapid and frequent statistical data observation , analysis , and fetching from remote sensors and would adjust the energy distribution accordingly .    * the tactile internet . *",
    "the tactile internet improves the user experience in a virtual environment to an extent of only milliseconds of interaction latency .",
    "the futuristic applications such as automated vehicle platooning , self - organizing transportation , the ability to acquire a virtual sense for physically challenged patients , synchronized remote smart - grids , remote robotics , and image processing with customized / panoramic view would use the tactile internet protocols  @xcite .    * automation . *",
    "self - driving vehicles would take place in the near future , and as a requirement , vehicles would communicate with each other in real - time .",
    "moreover , they would communicate with other devices on the roads , homes , and offices with a requirement of almost zero latency .",
    "hence , an interconnected vehicular environment would provide a safe and efficient integration with other information systems .    * healthcare systems .",
    "* a reliable , secure , and fast mobile communication can strengthen medical services , _",
    "e_._g_. , frequent data transfer from patients body to the cloud or health care centers .",
    "therefore , the relevant and urgent medical services could be predicted and delivered to the patients very fast .",
    "* logistics and tracking . * the future mobile communication would also assist in inventory or package tracking using location based information systems .",
    "the most popular way would be to embed a radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tag and to provide a continuous connectivity irrespective of the geographic locations .",
    "* industrial usages . *",
    "the zero latency property of 5 g networks would help robots , sensors , drones , mobile devices , users , and data collector devices to have real - time data without any delay , which would help to manage and operate industrial functions quickly while preserving energy .",

    "the simulator has shown 1000-times increase in the system capacity , and 90% users achieved 1gbps data rate .",
    "docomo also performed a real experiment in the year 2012 , where data was uploaded at the speed of 10gbps .",
    "samsung performed data transmission experiment using mmwave at 28 ghz frequency band and achieved the world s first highest data rate of 1.2gbps on a vehicle running at the speed of @xmath5 100 km/h .",
    "further , when the vehicle was nearby a stop , the data transmission speed was achieved up to 7.5gbps . in the experiment ,",

    "we conclude our discussion with a resonating notion that the design of 5 g infrastructure is still under progress .",
    "the most prominent issues are enlisted below , and to provide elegant solutions to these issues would contribute in early deployment as well as in long run growth of 5 g networks .    * the security and privacy of devices , infrastructures , communication , and data transfer is yet to be explored .",
