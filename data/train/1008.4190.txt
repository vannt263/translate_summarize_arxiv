    "galactic cosmic rays are widely believed to be accelerated in supernova remnants ( snrs ) through the diffusive shock acceleration process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a , the lat - detected snrs are known to be interacting with molecular clouds . the gev emission from such snrs",
    "is expected to be dominated by the hadronic gamma rays due to the decay of @xmath8 mesons , since the ambient dense molecular cloud would enhance the proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "the observed gamma - ray sources associated with cloud - interacting snrs are all seen to be spatially extended in the lat data .",
    "based on the extension and its comparison with radio data , it is concluded that the gamma - ray emission comes from snrs not from pulsars / pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",

    "although electron bremsstrahlung can not be ruled out , @xmath8-decay emission is the most plausible explanation for the observed lat data @xcite .",
    "the breaks in the observed spectra may be accounted for by an energy - dependent escape of accelerated protons at snrs @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray measurements in the tev range provide direct support for the acceleration of particles up to @xmath9 tev in snr shells @xcite . the tev gamma rays in snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 , one of the most prominent examples of tev - emitting snrs ,",

    "* ) if the average magnetic field strength is larger than @xmath10 g @xcite .",
    "however , the emission mechanism remains unsettled largely because of poorly constrained physical conditions in the gamma - ray - emitting zone in snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 .",
    "other examples are valuable for discriminating the origins of the gamma - ray emission .",
    "snr w49b ( g43.3@xmath00.2 ) has a bright radio shell and centrally peaked thermal x - ray emission .",

    "the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ was launched on june 11 2008 . the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard _ fermi _ is composed of electron - positron pair trackers , featuring solid state silicon trackers and cesium iodide calorimeters , sensitive to photons in a very broad energy band ( from 0.02 to @xmath16300  gev ) .",
    "the lat has a large effective area ( @xmath118000 cm@xmath4 above 1 gev if on - axis ) , viewing @xmath112.4 sr of the full sky with a good angular resolution ( 68 % containment radius better than @xmath111@xmath18 above 1  gev ) .",
    "the tracker of the lat is divided into _ front _ and _ back _ sections .",
    "the front section ( first 12 planes ) has thin converters to improve the psf , while the back section ( 4 planes after the front section ) has thicker converters to enlarge the effective area .",
    "the angular resolution of the back events is a factor of two worse than that of the front events at 1  gev .",
    "the lat data used here were collected for about 17 months from august 4 2008 to december 26 2009 .",
    "the _ diffuse _ event class was chosen and photons beyond the earth zenith angle of 105@xmath19 were excluded to minimize earth albedo gamma rays .    among the standard science analysis tools , we utilized gtlike for spectral fits and gtfindsrc to find a point source location .",
    "with gtlike , an unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed on the spatial and spectral distributions of observed gamma rays to optimize spectral parameters of the input model taking into account the energy dependence of the point spread function ( psf ) . on the other hand",
    ", gtfindsrc optimizes a point source location by finding the best likelihood for different positions around an initial guess until the convergence tolerance for a positional fit is reached .",

    "details of the lat instrument and data reduction are described in @xcite .",
    "the lat observation revealed significant ( @xmath1 ) gamma - ray emission from the direction of snr w49b with 17 months of data .",
    "figure  [ smallfov ] shows lat count maps in the vicinity of snr w49b in the 26  gev and 630  gev bands . only _",
    "front _ events are used in the count map to achieve better angular resolution . the effective lat point - spread function ( psf )",
    "is constructed using a spectral shape obtained through a maximum likelihood fit ( gtlike ) in the corresponding energy band for each count map ( see  [ sec : sed ] ) .",
    "the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the spectral shape do not noticeably affect the psf shape .",
    "spitzer _ near - infrared ( 5.8  @xmath20 m ) map , which traces ionic shocks in the snr , is overlaid on the count maps .",
    "both count maps clearly suggest that gamma - ray emission comes predominantly from the snr w49b region , not from a nearby star forming region , w49a .",
    "comparisons between gamma - ray distributions and lat psfs in both energy bands indicate that the observed gamma - ray emission could be consistent with a point source .    in order to confirm the consistency with a point source , a radial profile of the gamma rays from the above source location",
    "is compared with that expected for a point source for _ front _ events in 230  gev band as shown in figure  [ radprof ] .",
    "the background , which is composed mainly of the galactic diffuse emission , is subtracted .",
    "no sign of spatial extension can be seen in figure  [ radprof ] .    to evaluate the consistency with a point source quantitatively , we compared the likelihood of the spectral fit for a point source and an elliptical shape ( @xmath21 in size ; compatible with the extent of the ir image as shown in figure  [ smallfov ] ) with a uniform surface brightness . here",
    ", we assumed a broken power law function to model the source spectrum in the fit ( see  [ sec : sed ] for details ) .",
    "the resulting likelihood was almost the same for both cases ( difference of log likelihood was @xmath22 ) , which means the source emission is consistent with that from a point source .",
    "therefore , to simplify the analyses , the gamma - ray source in the snr w49b region is analyzed as a point source in this paper .",
    "assuming a point source , the gamma - ray source position was found to be ( @xmath23 , @xmath24)=(@xmath25 , @xmath26 ) with an error radius of @xmath27 at 95% confidence level using gtfindsrc , as indicated by the black circle in figure  [ smallfov ] .",
    "since uncertainties associated with the underlying galactic diffuse emission are expected to be the largest systematic effects for spectral analyses of the w49b source , those effects should be carefully evaluated .",
    "the uncertainties of the galactic diffuse emission are primarily due to the imperfection of the galactic diffuse model and/or the contributions from unresolved point sources . as a first step of the evaluation process",
    ", the position and energy dependences of the discrepancies between the observed gamma - ray distributions and the galactic diffuse model are studied in the regions where the galactic diffuse emission is considered to be dominant around the w49b source .",
    "the normalization of the galactic diffuse model is determined by running gtlike for a circular region with a radius of @xmath28 centered on the w49b source in the energy range of 0.2200  gev .",
    "the position of the w49b source is fixed at ( @xmath23 , @xmath24)=(@xmath25 , @xmath26 ) determined by gtfindsrc ( see   [ sed : detect ] ) .",
    "the positions and spectral shapes of all other sources are fixed at the value in the 1fgl catalog , while the flux is allowed to vary , except for psr j1907 + 06 @xcite , snr w51c @xcite and snr w44 @xcite which are 3 , 6 and 9 degrees away from w49b , respectively .",
    "since these sources around snr w49b are very bright as evident in figure  [ segments ] , we carefully evaluated spectral models for these sources . for this study we modeled w44 as two point sources at ( @xmath23 , @xmath24)=(@xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , to approximately account for its angular extent , while the positions of the other sources are fixed at the values determined by the catalog .",
    "the spectral shape of these four bright sources is assumed to be a broken power law since likelihood tests between a power law function and a broken power law function favored a broken power law hypothesis at @xmath33 ( psr j1907 + 06 ) , @xmath34 ( snr w51c ) , @xmath35 ( snr w44 ) confidence levels .",
    "all spectral parameters ( flux , spectral break and spectral indices at low and high energy ) are allowed to vary in the fitting since the spectral model is different from that reported in the 1fgl catalog .",
    "the galactic diffuse emission is modeled using  gll_iem_v02.fit \" . an isotropic component ( isotropic_iem_v02.txt ) is also included to account for instrumental and extragalactic diffuse backgrounds .",
    "the both background models are the standard diffuse emission models released by the lat team .",
    "the normalization factors of the galactic diffuse and the isotropic models are allowed to vary .    in order to evaluate the the validity of spectra for background models ,",
    "we compared two counts spectra in the 0.210  gev band ; the spectrum expected from the models obtained by the above procedure , and the observed spectrum .",
    "this comparison is performed in a nearby circular region with a radius of @xmath36 centered on @xmath37 and @xmath38 from snr w49b where the galactic diffuse component is dominant .",

    "this value is much higher than @xmath129 calculated for @xmath8-decay dominant modeling of middle - aged snr w51c  @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mw_brems ] , the gamma - ray spectrum is modeled formally by relativistic bremsstrahlung of electrons .",
    "the less - luminous @xmath8-decay component is also plotted using @xmath130 .",
    "it is shown that @xmath131 is required to reproduce the radio spectrum .",
    "if relativistic bremsstrahlung is responsible for the gamma rays , the ratio of the energy density of relativistic electrons to that of magnetic fields becomes very high , @xmath132 ( table  [ tbl : model ] ) .",
    "the energy density required ( @xmath133 ) is also much higher than @xmath134 calculated for bremsstrahlung dominant modeling of w51c .",
    "we have studied gamma - ray emission in the direction of snr w49b using about 17 months of data accumulated by the _ fermi _ lat . the observed energy spectrum in 0.2200  gev exhibits steepening toward high energies ,",
    "although a simple power - law function can not be completely ruled out given the uncertainties of the galactic diffuse model .",
    "the luminosity is estimated to be @xmath89  kpc)@xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 , which makes this source one of the most luminous gamma - ray sources in the galaxy .",
    "the gamma - ray source is unresolved by the lat , which is consistent with the angular size of snr w49b ( @xmath12 in diameter ) taking into account the effective lat psf .",
    "assuming a point source , the source position is found to be ( @xmath23 , @xmath24)=(@xmath25 , @xmath26 ) with an error radius of @xmath27 at 95% confidence level .",
    "this result clearly shows that the gamma - ray emission comes predominantly from the snr w49b region , not from a nearby star forming region , w49a .",
    "we put an upper limit on the gamma - ray luminosity of w49a as @xmath135 at 95% confidence level .",
    "the gamma - ray emission in the direction of snr w49b is unlikely to come from a pulsar .",
    "the gamma - ray energy distribution is different from that observed for other pulsars with the lat .",
    "in addition , no pulsed emission has been detected with the lat nor are any radio pulsars known in this direction .    a good match between the best - fit lat position and the brightest part of synchrotron radio emission",
    "suggests that the gamma - ray source originates in the shell of snr w49b .",
    "the lat spectrum can be formally explained either by @xmath8-decay gamma rays or by electron bremsstrahlung . for both cases ,",
    "the calculated energy density of relativistic particles is evaluated to be very high , @xmath7 .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
