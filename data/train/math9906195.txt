    "the study of special knots in contact three manifolds provided great insight into the geometry and topology of three manifolds . in particular , the study of legendrian knots ( ones tangent to the contact planes ) has been useful in distinguishing homotopic contact structures on @xmath0 @xcite and homology spheres @xcite . moreover",
    ", rudolph @xcite has shown that invariants of legendrian knots can be useful in understanding slicing properties of knots .",
    "the first example of the use of knot theory in contact topology was in the work of bennequin . in @xcite bennequin used transversal knots ( ones transversal to the contact planes ) to show that @xmath1 has exotic contact structures .",
    "this was the genesis of eliashberg s insightful tight versus overtwisted dichotomy in three dimensional contact geometry .",
    "in addition to its importance in the understanding of contact geometry , the study of transversal and legendrian knots is quite interesting in its own right .",
    "questions concerning transversal and legendrian knots have most prominently appeared in @xcite and kirby s problem list @xcite .",
    "currently there are very few general theorems concerning the classification of these knots . in @xcite ,",
    "eliashberg classified transversal unknots in terms of their self - linking number . in @xcite",
    ", legendrian unknots were similarly classified . in this paper",
    "we will extend this classification to positive transversal torus knots .",
    "in particular we prove :    positive transversal torus knots are transversely isotopic if and only if they have the same topological knot type and the same self - linking number .    in the process of proving this result",
    "we will examine _ transversal stabilization_. this is a simple method for creating one transversal knot from another . by showing that all positive transversal torus knots whose self - linking number is less than maximal come from this stabilization process we are able to reduce the above theorem to the classification of positive transversal torus knots with maximal self - linking number .",
    "stabilization also provides a general way to approach the classification problem for other knot types .",
    "for example , we can reprove eliashberg s classification of transversal unknots using stabilization ideas and basic contact topology .",
    "it is widely believed that the self - linking number is not a complete invariant for transversal knots . however , as of the writing of this paper , there is no known knot type whose transversal realizations are not determined by their self - linking number . for legendrian knots , in contrast , eliashberg and hofer ( currently unpublished ) and chekanov @xcite have produced examples of legendrian knots that are not determined by their corresponding invariants .    in section",
    "[ basic ] we review some standard facts concerning contact geometry on three manifolds . in section  [ sec : main ] we prove our main theorem modulo some details concerning the characteristic foliations on tori which are proved in section  [ tori ] and some results on stabilizations proved in section  [ stab ] . in the last section we discuss some open questions .",

    "this allows us to finally conclude that we may isotop @xmath76 so that @xmath148 .",
    "now since @xmath96 and @xmath97 represent the same homology class on @xmath149 and they are both transverse to the foliation we may use lemma  [ isotopic ] to transversely isotop @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",

    "thus we just demonstrate that @xmath96 is a stabilization of some transversal knot .    from the above proof",
    "it is clear that if we can not eliminate all the singularities in the characteristic foliation of the torus @xmath67 on which @xmath96 sits then there is a disk on the torus which exhibits @xmath96 as a stabilization .    if we can remove all the singularities from @xmath67 then by we know that the self - linking number of , say , the meridian @xmath72 is less than @xmath10 .",

    "we can use the disk @xmath75 to guide a transverse isotopy of @xmath40 that will decrease the number of intersections of @xmath16 and @xmath40 contradicting our assumption of minimality . to see this , note that the local orientability of the foliation implies that we can define a winding number of @xmath66 around @xmath173 .",

    "there is a contact isotopy preserving @xmath104 taking @xmath4 to @xmath177 .",
    "once again one can use a darboux chart to check this lemma ( for some details see @xcite ) .",
    "any two single stabilizations of @xmath104 along a fixed legendrian arc are transversely isotopic .    with this lemma",
    "our proof of theorem  [ tm - stab ] is complete .    we now observe that using we may reprove eliashberg s result concerning transversal unknots .",
    "the reader should note that this `` new proof '' is largely just a reordering / rewording of eliashberg s proof .",
    "two transversal unknots are transversally isotopic if and only if they have the same self - linking number .",
    "using we only need to prove that two transversal unknots with self - linking number @xmath10 are transversally isotopic , since by looking at the characteristic foliation on a seifert disk it is clear that a transversal unknot with self - linking number less than @xmath10 is a single stabilization of another unknot . but",
    "given a transversal unknot with self - linking number @xmath10 we may find a disk that it bounds with precisely one positive elliptic singularity in its characteristic foliation .",
    "using the characteristic foliation on the disk the unknot may be transversely isotoped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the elliptic point .",
    "thus given two such knots we may now find a contact isotopy of taking the elliptic point on one of the seifert disks to the elliptic point on the other .",
    "since the seifert disks are tangent at their respective elliptic points we may arrange that they agree in a neighborhood of the elliptic points .",
    "now by shrinking the seifert disks more we may assume that both unknots sit on the same disk .",
    "it is now a simple matter to transversely isotop one unknot to the other .",
    "we would like to note that many of the techniques in this paper work for negative torus knots as well ( though the proofs above do not always indicate this ) .",
    "there are two places where we can not make the above proofs work for negative torus knots , they are :    * from equation  [ eqn : l - formula ] we can not conclude that the self - linking numbers of @xmath72 and @xmath78 are @xmath10 when @xmath182 is maximal as we could for positive torus knots .",
    "* we can not always conclude that a negative torus knot with self - linking less than maximal is a stabilization .",
    "let @xmath183 and let @xmath96 be a @xmath82curve on the boundary of @xmath70 .",
    "now if @xmath104 is a null homologous knot in a three manifold @xmath23 then let @xmath184 be a diffeomorphism from @xmath70 to a neighborhood @xmath185 of @xmath104 in @xmath23 taking @xmath186 to a longitude for @xmath104 .",
    "we now define the to be the knot @xmath187 .",
    "eliashberg s theorem  [ unknots ] says that the unknot @xmath21 is in @xmath188 .",
    "our main theorem  [ main ] says that any positive cable of the unknot is in @xmath188 .",
    "this provides the first bit of evidence that the answer to the question might be yes , at least for `` suitably positive '' cablings .",
    "given a knot type one might hope , using the observation on stabilizations in this paper , to prove that transversal knots in this knot type are determined by their self - linking number as follows : first establishing that there is a unique transversal knot in this knot type with maximal self - linking number . then showing that any transversal knot in this knot type that does not have maximal self - linking number is a stabilization .",
    "the second part of this program is of independent interest so we ask the following question :      it would be somewhat surprising if the answer to this question is yes in complete generality but understanding when the answer is yes and when and why it is no should provide insight into the structure of transversal knots .",
    "we end by mentioning that the techniques in this paper also seem to shed light on legendrian torus knots .",
    "it seems quite likely that their isotopy class may be determined by their thurston ",
    "bennequin invariant and rotation number .",
