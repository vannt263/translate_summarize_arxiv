    "in the 70s , milnor and thurston came up with an intriguing way of computing the topological entropy @xmath0 for a continuous piecewise monotone interval map @xmath4 .",
    "they invented a `` kneading - matrix '' , @xmath5 , a finite matrix - valued powerseries in an auxiliary variable @xmath6 .",
    "the matrix keeps track of relative positions of forward orbits of critical points relative to the critical points themselves .",
    "the `` milnor - thurston '' determinant , @xmath7 , defines an analytic function in the unit disk and they showed that if @xmath8 then @xmath9 is a zero of @xmath10 .",
    "the zero is ` extremal ' in the sense that it is the smallest in absolute value .",
    "their result is computationally useful , as the effort in a direct computation of the number of monotonicity intervals of @xmath11 grows like @xmath12 whereas computing @xmath5 to a similar accuracy only grows linearly with @xmath13 .",
    "the above - mentioned extremal property was shown indirectly by proving that @xmath10 is identical to a certain lefschetz zeta - function , generated from the periodic orbits for @xmath4 .",
    "the identity is shown in one ( simple ) case and using continuous deformations of the map it is shown that the identity persists under such deformations . this part is rather puzzling , as no arguments indicate why one would expect such a relation .    also in the 70s , ruelle used transfer operators to define ( generalized ) fredholm determinants and zeta - functions . in our context",
    ", an operator @xmath3 would act upon functions of bounded variation .",
    "iterates of @xmath3 keep track of inverse orbits of points and its spectral radius equals precisely @xmath14 .",
    "baladi - keller showed @xcite , that an associated determinant @xmath15 is analytic in the unit disk and ( at least for expanding maps ) it is easy to see that the zeros within the unit disk are the same as for the lefschetz zeta function whence also for @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests a deep relation between the the m - t determinant and the ruelle - determinant of @xmath3 , whence with the operator @xmath3 itself .",
    "a step towards clarifying this relationship was suggested through a study of the dual operator by baladi and ruelle @xcite , but the functional setup makes explicit computions hard and requires operator - weights to be globally continuous .",
    "gouzel @xcite , elaborating the functional setup further , still requires weights to be continuous at periodic points .",
    "both of these results exclude partially the case studied by milnor and thurston .",
    "the goal here is to show that the determinant of milnor - thurston may be obtained by restricting @xmath3 to a suitable small subspace @xmath16 of bounded variation functions , and calculate an elementary regularized determinant of the dual operator @xmath17 .",
    "we first exhibit a natural isometry between the dual space @xmath18 and a space @xmath19 of uniformly bounded functions of `` point - germs '' .",
    "this gives an explicit representation for the dual operator , @xmath20 , in which @xmath21 has spectral radius @xmath22 and @xmath23 is of finite rank .",
    "when @xmath24 ( we call such a value a peripheral value ) then @xmath25 is invertible through a von neumann series . the elementary formula , @xmath26 shows that @xmath27 is a spectral value iff the operator @xmath28 is non - invertible . as @xmath23 is of finite rank , this happens iff the following finite dimensional determinant vanishes : @xmath29 finally , setting @xmath30 this turns out to be the milnor - thurston determinant .",
    "an advantage of the present approach is that we may exploit positivity of the ruelle operator ( see theorem [ thm positivity ] below ) to bypass the use of the lifschetz zeta - function in the proof of the extremal property of the zero .",
    "fix @xmath31 . the variation of a function @xmath32",
    "is : @xmath33 we say that @xmath34 is of bounded variation ( bv ) iff @xmath35 . for a bv - function",
    "right and left limits always exist and following usual conventions we write @xmath36 and @xmath37 defined for @xmath38 and @xmath39 $ ] , respectively . we assume no a priori relation between the values of @xmath34 at @xmath40,@xmath41 and @xmath42 ( see also remark [ remark choice ] below ) .",
    "we define the boundary value of @xmath34 to be @xmath43    in the following we write @xmath44 for either @xmath42 or @xmath40 and call it a point germ with base point @xmath41 and direction @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "we order point germs intertwined with base points by declaring that when @xmath47 then @xmath48 .",
    "any real segment may then be specified through two point - germs by setting : @xmath49 .",
    "so e.g.  @xmath50 ( for @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "a map @xmath54 is said to be a simple step function if there is a finite set @xmath55 so that @xmath34 is constant on each connented component of @xmath56 .",
    "we write @xmath57 for the space of simple step functions on @xmath58 .    when @xmath59 then @xmath60 .",
    "letting @xmath61 and @xmath62 yields @xmath63 .",
    "one easily obtains  :    the quantity @xmath64 defines a norm on @xmath21 .",

    "we define for every @xmath68 the following `` base '' step - function ( which is everywhere non - zero ) : @xmath69 in particular , @xmath70 for all @xmath71 . in terms of characteristic functions",

    "we call this the @xmath80-transform of @xmath81 and write @xmath82    as is readily seen , @xmath78 has norm one , so @xmath83 .",

    "but more is true :    [ prop duality ] the @xmath80-transform @xmath90 is a banach space isometry .    proof : the collection @xmath91 forms a base for @xmath21 , the space of simple step functions . in fact , given any simple step function @xmath34 there is a finite number of point germs @xmath92 so that : @xmath93    we omit a term involving @xmath94 since @xmath95 and the latter is already included in the sum .",
    "the decomposition is unique if every @xmath96 , @xmath97 . in terms of this decomposition : @xmath98 to see this , note that the variation is bounded by the right hand sum and as is readily checked , the supremum in the definition ( [ def var ] ) may be realized by choosing a mesh that verifies : @xmath99 .",
    "the norm of @xmath34 is given by : @xmath100 given a simple step function @xmath101 it may be decomposed as in ( [ decomp ] ) and using the expression ( [ phi norm ] ) for the norm we see that : @xmath102 @xmath103 now , this extends by continuity to every @xmath34 in @xmath16 , the completion of @xmath104 .",
