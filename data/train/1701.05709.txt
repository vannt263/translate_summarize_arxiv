    "understanding dissipative quantum dynamics of a system embedded in a complex environment is an important topic across various sub - disciplines of physics and chemistry .",
    "significant progress in the understanding of condensed phase dynamics have been achieved within the context of a few prototypical models@xcite such as caldeira - leggett model and spin - boson model . in most cases",
    "the environment is modeled as a bosonic bath , a set of non - interacting harmonic oscillators whose influences on the system is concisely encoded in a spectral density . the prevalent adoption of bosonic bath models is based on the arguments that knowing the linear response of an environment near equilibrium should be sufficient to predict the dissipative quantum dynamics of the system .    despite many important advancements in the quantum dissipation theory have been made with the standard bosonic bath models in the past decades , more and more physical and chemical studies have suggested the essential roles that other bath models assume .",
    "we briefly summarize three scenarios below .    1 .",
    "a standard bosonic bath model fails to predict the correct electron transfer rate in donor - acceptor complex strongly coupled to some low - frequency intramolecular modes .",
    "some past attempts to model such an anharmonic , condensed phase environment include ( a ) using a bath of non - interacting morse@xcite or quartic oscillatorsand ( b ) mapping anharmonic environment onto effective harmonic modes@xcite with a temperature - dependent spectral density .",
    "another prominent example is the fermonic bath model .",
    "electronic transports through nanostructures , such as quantum dots or molecular junctions , involves particle exchange occurs across the system - bath boundary .",
    "recent developments of several many - body physics and chemistry methods , such as the dynamical mean - field theory@xcite and the density matrix embedding theory@xcite , reformulate the original problem in such a way that a crucial part of the methods is to solve an open quantum impurity model embedded in a fermionic environment .",
    "the spin ( two - level system ) bath models have also received increased attention over the years due to ongoing interests in developing various solid - state quantum technologies@xcite under the ultralow temperature when the phonon or vibrational modes are frozen and coupling to other physical spins ( such as nuclear spins carried by the lattice atoms ) , impurities or defects in the host material emerge as the dominant channels of decoherence .",
    "both bosonic and fermionic environments are gaussian baths , which can be exactly treated by the linear response@xcite in the path integral formalism . for the non - gaussian baths , attaining numerically exact open quantum dynamics would require either access to higher order response function of the bath in terms of its multi - time correlation functions or explicit dynamical treatments of the bath degrees of freedom ( dofs ) .    in this work , we extend a stochastic formulation@xcite of quantum dissipation by incorporating all three fundamental bath models : non - interacting bosons , fermions and spins .",
    "the stochastic liouville equation ( sle ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sleq ] ) , prescribes a simple yet general form of quantum dissipative dynamics when the bath effects are modelled as colored noises @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "different bath models and bath properties are distinguished in the present framework by assigning distinct noise variables and associated statistics .",
    "for instance , in dealing with bosonic and fermionic baths , the noises are complex - valued and grassmann - valued gaussian processes , respectively , and characterized by the two - time correlation functions such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi_corr ] ) .",
    "the grassmann - valued noises are adopted whenever the environment is composed of fermionic modes as these algebraic entities would bring out the gaussian characteristics of fermionic modes . for anharmonic environments , such as a spin bath ,",
    "the required noises are generally non - gaussian .",
    "two - time statistics can not fully distinguish these processes and higher order statistics furnished with bath multi - time correlation functions are needed . despite the conceptual simplicity of the sle , achieving stable convergences in stochastic simulations has proven to be challenging in the long - time limit .",
    "even for the most well - studied bosonic bath models , it is still an active research topic to develop efficient stochastic simulation schems@xcite today .",
    "our group has successfully applied stochastic path integral simulations to calculate ( imaginary - time ) thermal distributions@xcite , absorption / emission spectra@xcite and energy transfer@xcite ; however , a direct stochastic simulation of real - time dynamics remains formidable . in this study , we consider generic quantum environments that either exhibit non - gaussian characteristics or invovles ferimonic degrees of freedoms ( and associated grassmann noise in the stochastic formalism ) .",
    "both scenarios present new challenges to developing efficient stochastic simulations .",
    "hence , in subsequent discussions , all numerical methods developed are strictly deterministic .",
    "we note that it is common to derive exact master equation@xcite , hierarchical equation of motions@xcite , and hybrid stochastic - deterministic numerical methods@xcite from a stochastic formulation of open quantum theory . in sec .  [",
    "sec : spectral ] , we further illustrate the usefulness of our stochastic frmulation by presenting a numerical scheme that would be difficult to obtain within a strictly deterministic framework of open quantum theory .",
    "furthermore , the stochastic formalism gives straightforward prescriptions to compute dynamical quantities such as @xmath2 , which represents system - bath joint observables , as done in a recently proposed theory@xcite .",
    "staring from the sle , we derive numerical schemes to deterministically simulate quantum dynamics for all three fundamental bath models .",
    "the key step is to formally average out the noise variables in the sle .",
    "a common approach is to introduce auxiliary density matrices ( adms ) , in close parallel to the hierarchical equation of motion ( heom ) formalism@xcite , that fold noise - induced fluctuations on reduced density matrix in these auxiliary constructs with their own equations of motions . to facilitate the formal derivation with the noise averaging , we consider two distinct ways to expand the adms with respect to a complete set of orthonormal functions in the time domain . in the first case",
    ", the basis set corresponds to the eigenfunctions of the bath s two - time correlation functions .",
    "this approach provides an efficient description of open quantum dynamics for bosonic bath models .",
    "unfortunately , it is not convenient to extend this approach to study non - gaussian bath models .",
    "we then investigate another approach inspired by a recent work on the extended heom ( eheom)@xcite .",
    "in this case , we expand the bath s multi - time correlation functions in an arbitrary set of orthonormal functions .",
    "this approach generalizes eheom to the study of non - gaussian and fermionic bath models with arbitrary spectral densities and temperature regimes .",
    "despite having a slightly more complex form , our fermionic heom can be easily related to the existing formalism@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we refer to the family of numerical schemes discussed in this work collectively as the generalized hierarchical equations ( ghe ) .    among the three fundamental bath models ,",
    "spin baths deserve more attentions .",
    "a spin bath can feature very different physical properties@xcite from the standard heat bath composed of non - interacting bosons ; especially , when the bath is composed of localized nuclear / electron spins@xcite , defects and impurities .",
    "this kind of spin environment is often of a finite - size and has an extremely narrow bandwidth of frequencies .",
    "to more efficiently handle this situation , we consider a dual - fermion mapping that transforms each spin into a pair of coupled fermions . at the expense of introducing an extra set of fermionic dofs , it becomes possible to recast the non - gaussian properties of the original spin bath in terms of gaussian processes in the extended space . in a subsequent work , the paper ii@xcite",
