    "in this paper we investigate a square ",
    "latice ising spin@xmath2 system with ferro and antiferromagnetic interactions , in the presence of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . here",
    ", all fields , coupling strengths and temperatures will be given in units of @xmath4 . at @xmath1 , @xmath7 ,",
    "the ground state consists of alternating @xmath8 stripes along the @xmath9 axis , while for larger @xmath10 all spins are parallel to the field . a critical line @xmath11 connects @xmath12 to the zero - field onsager critical point , which for @xmath13 is at @xmath14 .",
    "since the ground state does not exhibit macroscopic residual entropy , the transition along @xmath11 is expected  @xcite to belong to the ising universality class for all @xmath15 , similarly to the closely - connected case of the standard ( isotropic ) antiferromagnet in a uniform field  @xcite .",
    "the problem described by eq  ( [ eq : def ] ) was treated by mller - hartmann and zittartz s interface method  @xcite in ref .  , which provides an excellent summary of earlier work .",
    "it was revisited in ref .  , using an approach which considers the zeros of the partition function on an elementary lattice cycle , and their connection to the free energy singularity at the transition  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the critical line found in ref .",
    "is predicted to display a positive slope close to @xmath1 , so the critical field reaches a maximum at some nonzero @xmath16 before approaching zero at higher temperatures .",
    "similar reentrant behavior was predicted upon application of a bethe - peierls approximation  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear - chain approximation  @xcite gives an exponentially vanishing positive slope at @xmath1 , while the interface method also predicts an exponentially vanishing value , only on the negative side  @xcite .",
    "recent real - space renormalization results  @xcite point to a finite negative slope at @xmath1 .",
    "we use transfer - matrix ( tm ) methods , in connection with finite - size scaling and conformal invariance ideas , in order to produce a numerically accurate phase diagram for this problem .",
    "the underlying hypotheses in our work are : ( i ) that the phase transition is second - order all along the critical line , and ( ii ) that it belongs to the ising universality class .",
    "both assumptions are critically reviewed towards the end of the paper , in light of the numerical results obtained while assuming their validity . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we recall the calculational methods used for the approximate location of the critical line ; the respective results are exhibited , as well as their extrapolation in the thermodynamic limit . in sec .  [ conc ] , we analyze the data generated in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , both in comparison with the existing literature , and in regard to their internal consistency .",
    "the universality of critical behavior is discussed , and concluding remarks are made .",
    "we have kept @xmath13 in all calculations reported here .",
    "we set up the tm on strips of width @xmath17 sites , with periodic boundary conditions across . referring to eq .",
    "( [ eq : def ] ) , three choices of orientation are available in this case , namely the tm can be iterated along the ferromagnetic ( f ) , or @xmath9 direction ; along the antiferromagnetic ( af ) , or @xmath18 direction ; or along the diagonal ( d ) of the square lattice . as this is a weakly anisotropic system  @xcite",
    ", one would expect estimates of , e.g. , critical exponents and locations of critical points , to converge to the same orientation - independent limit for @xmath19 , while finite - size corrections should differ in each case . in order to obey the ground - state symmetry , only even values of @xmath17",
    "are allowed for f and d , while no such restriction applies to af .",
    "we generally used @xmath20 ; for f we went up to @xmath21 .",
    "this range of @xmath17 enabled the authors of ref .   to locate the critical line of the isotropic ising antiferromagnet to very high accuracy .",
    "following earlier work on similar problems  @xcite , our finite-@xmath17 estimates for the critical line are found by requiring that the amplitude - exponent relation of conformal invariance on strips  @xcite be satisfied , with the ising decay - of - correlations exponent @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the inverse correlation length on a strip of width @xmath17 sites , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the two largest eigenvalues ( in absolute value ) of the tm .    for @xmath27 , the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : conf - inv ] ) leave the @xmath16 axis vertically , and are very close to each other for all three orientations of the tm .",
    "we shall briefly return to this , towards the end of the paper . for low temperatures @xmath28 , the main region of interest here ,",
    "substantial differences arise .",
    "these are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowt ] .",
    "one sees that , with increasing @xmath17 , all three families of curves get closer together , though af does so at a slower rate .",
    "also , in all cases their limiting shape for @xmath29 is , with very good accuracy , a straight line going through the exact zero - temperature fixed point at @xmath30 .",
    "reentrant behavior is clearly visible for the f curves and , to a lesser extent , for the d ones , though in both cases the peaks turn flatter as @xmath17 increases . in order to check whether the reentrancies vanish in the @xmath31 limit",
    ", we plotted the sequences of slopes @xmath32 of the @xmath33 straight - line sections referred to above , against @xmath34 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slope ] . for both f and d",
    "the trend is , to an excellent approximation , @xmath35 linearly with @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , the respective extrapolated values are @xmath36 ( f ) and @xmath37 ( d ) , which in practice equate to zero within the present context . for af , a large amount of curvature is present ; from a parabolic fit ( @xmath38 ) of @xmath39 data , one gets @xmath40 .",
    "this would correspond to @xmath41 at @xmath42 which , though small , is significant .    in summary ,",
    "the analysis of limiting slopes at low @xmath16 , @xmath43 , indicates that the reentrant behavior observed for f and d data is a finite - size effect , which tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a small discrepancy still remains , between f and d data which are consistent with a horizontal critical line at @xmath33 , and af results which point to a slightly negative slope in that limit .",
    "further insight can be gained by relaxing the assumption made in eq  ( [ eq : conf - inv ] ) , that the phase transition belongs to the ising universality class , and demanding only that it remain of second order . from finite - size scaling ,",
    "one gets the basic equation of the phenomenological renormalization group ( prg )  @xcite for the critical line : @xmath44 where the strip widths @xmath17 and @xmath45 are to be taken as close as possible for improved convergence of results against increasing @xmath17 .",
    "this means @xmath46 for f , d , and @xmath47 for af .",
    "we found that prg results converge very rapidly for both f and d orientations of the tm , without any sign of the reentrances shown by the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conf - inv ] ) . for the f case , the largest discrepancies between @xmath48 and @xmath49 amount to @xmath50 close to @xmath51 , and are slowly reduced upon increasing @xmath10 ; around @xmath52 , @xmath53 , the two curves differ by @xmath54 . at @xmath55 ,",
    "both coincide to within two parts in @xmath56 , at less than @xmath57 of @xmath30 , and then home in towards @xmath58 on a straight line .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath59 and @xmath60 is never more than one part in @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "the picture is quantitatively similar for the d orientation .    on the other hand , for prg with the tm along the af direction",
    ", one gets relatively large negative slopes ( but approaching zero with increasing @xmath17 ) as @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , at intermediate temperatures @xmath63 the curves show inflection points which make extrapolation of such sections to @xmath43 prone to instabilities .",
    "the above - mentioned features are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : prg ] .",
    "we investigated the behavior of the limiting slopes for the af family against @xmath64 , with results displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : slope_afprg ] .",
    "the line shown in the figure is a parabolic fit to data ( @xmath38 ) , from which one gets @xmath65 , i.e. , essentially zero .      in this subsection",
    ", we deal directly with extrapolations of finite - size data for all @xmath66 .",
    "this is in contrast to the analysis of slopes , which applies only at low @xmath16 where the finite-@xmath17 data actually fall on straight lines .",
    "extensive investigation of the related problem of isotropic ising antiferromagnets in a field  @xcite shows that , in that case , the main irrelevant exponent is @xmath67 , i.e. , the leading corrections to scaling are expected to depend on @xmath68 .",
    "thus , it is plausible to assume that such corrections also play a dominant role here .",
    "however , the analysis of slopes above suggests that corrections in @xmath34 are present as well , at least in the low - temperature region .    in what follows ,",
    "we examine both scenarios , i.e. , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the locations of points on the approximate critical line , for strip width @xmath17 , are denoted by @xmath71 . on account of the overall shape of the phase diagram",
    ", we extrapolate against negative powers of @xmath17 in two different ways : ( i ) at constant @xmath72 for high @xmath73 , and ( ii ) at constant @xmath74 for @xmath75 . for large @xmath17 , we fit @xmath76 [ @xmath77 in ( i ) , or @xmath78 in ( ii ) ] to a form @xmath79 we have chosen to calculate @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 from the three largest values of @xmath17 available for each strip orientation , thus error bars ( other than those associated to the positions @xmath83 themselves ) are not available from this procedure .",
    "we managed to produce well - behaved extrapolated critical lines from the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : conf - inv ] ) , only for f and d orientations of the tm . for af , though extrapolations are generally smooth for @xmath84 , they display instabilities for lower @xmath16 , i.e. the section of the phase diagram which is most relevant in the search for reentrant behavior . as regards prg curves , due to the fast convergence of f and d data we found that @xmath85 data can already be taken as very close to the @xmath43 limit , to within an estimated one part in @xmath61 . as mentioned above , the extrapolated prg curves for af display instabilities , except for very low @xmath16 ( for which the relevant information is summarized in the slope analysis illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : slope_afprg ] ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : extr ] shows the low - temperature regions of extrapolated critical boundaries , for f and d , assuming @xmath69 or @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fs1 ] ) . for both curves corresponding to @xmath69 ,",
    "there is a rather flat section : for f , points with @xmath86 remain within one part in @xmath56 from @xmath30 , while for d the @xmath87 region is within one part in @xmath61 from that limit . on the other hand , the @xmath67 extrapolations exhibit tiny reentrances , with maxima respectively at @xmath88 ( f ) and @xmath89 ( d ) .    in order to get further insight into the competing scenarios under investigation , we examine the behavior of the coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fs1 ] ) along the critical line .",
    "indeed , this amounts to an unbiased test of whether the dominant @xmath17- dependence of finite - size data is on @xmath34 ( via @xmath90 ) or @xmath68 ( via @xmath91 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : coeffs ] one sees that , at low @xmath16 , the @xmath68 terms tend to vanish for both f and d cases .",
    "furthermore , the inset of the figure shows that in the low - field limit , it is the @xmath68 corrections that become dominant , and those in @xmath34 become negligible as @xmath92 , as is well known for the zero - field ising model  @xcite .",
    "the latter result gives further credence to the procedure just described , and thus to the conclusions reached regarding the low@xmath16 regime .",
    "finally , we found no clear evidence that an exponent @xmath93 , associated to vacancy excitations , might be present  @xcite .",
    "this is because ( i ) at the f and d data clearly depend predominantly on @xmath34 at low @xmath16 , as already shown in the slope analysis ; and ( ii ) the slope data for af do not exhibit any significant improvement in quality of fit when plotted against @xmath94 ( compared to the parabolic fits in @xmath34 of figs .",
    "[ fig : slope ] and  [ fig : slope_afprg ] ) .",
    "we begin by recalling that eq .",
    "( [ eq : prg ] ) depends on the existence of an underlying diverging correlation length , thus its non - trivial fixed points correspond to a second - order transition .",
    "we only failed to find such points for low temperatures , generally @xmath95 .",
    "this is due to the extremely slow convergence of numerical results , connected to the very large ratio between positive and negative exponentials which are the tm states boltzmann weights in that region .",
    "if a tricritical point were present , separating first- and second - order sections of the critical curve , one would expect spurious effects such as the `` hooking '' found for the three - dimensional version of the current problem  @xcite . on the contrary , as long as we can find low@xmath16 solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : prg ] ) they behave in the expected manner , i.e. homing in towards the exact @xmath1 fixed point at @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , the extrapolated @xmath22 curves agree very well with the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : prg ] ) down to @xmath96 , and still extend somewhat further down to @xmath97 since , by conformal invariance , @xmath22 corresponds to an ising transition , our results indicate that this is the character of the critical line , at least down to @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , if a tricritical point is present , it must be located at @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "we thus conclude that the transition is indeed second - order and in the ising universality class along the whole of the critical curve ( except for the latter possibility , which we are not able to probe directly ) .",
    "we now recall that the reentrant behavior predicted in ref .",
    "is sizable : in the units used in the present work , it translates into the critical line leaving @xmath58 with a slope @xmath101 [ @xmath102see their eq .",
    "( 31)@xmath102 ] .",
    "this is in contrast with the results of subsec .",
    "[ subsec:2c ] , where we find at most @xmath104 ( with the tm in the f direction , using @xmath67 ) .    in the comparable problem of isotropic antiferromagnets ,",
    "though the critical line @xmath105 given in ref",
    ".   does not exhibit reentrances , it is always above that found in refs .",
    "( except at the @xmath1 and @xmath51 ends , where both lines coincide ) .",
    "the maximum discrepancy , of order @xmath106 , is in the central region , @xmath107 , tailing off towards both ends .",
    "it thus appears that the methods employed in refs",
    ".   generally tend to overestimate the extent of the ordered region in parameter space .",
    "though the present problem is weakly anisotropic in a broad sense , the distinct nature of spin couplings along each coordinate axis is responsible for the introduction of subtle biases , when one iterates the tm along either of those very same axes .",
    "indeed , the size of the ordered region predicted by low-@xmath16 tm results systematically decreases as one changes orientation from f to d , and finally to af .",
    "the explanation is that , for the high fields near the critical curve , the ferromagnetic correlations picked out when the tm goes along f tend to be emphasized ; when the tm goes along af , the corresponding antiferromagnetic correlations are inhibited by the field .",
    "the small negative extrapolated slope of the af curves , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slope ] , most likely reflects the latter effect . for the tm going along d , an evenly - balanced mixture of both kinds of correlations",
    "is collected upon its iteration .",
    "therefore we believe that , of the three setups implemented here , the latter is the one likely to produce the most reliable results .",
    "note also that , for prg one is always comparing correlation lengths evaluated along the same lattice direction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prg ] ) , so the aforementioned biases tend to cancel out , if present .",
    "thus , ( i ) the prg curves for f and d do not show reentrancies , even for finite @xmath17 ; and ( ii ) the slope of prg curves for af approaches zero as @xmath108 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : slope_afprg ] ) , as opposed to the small negative value found for the corresponding solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conf - inv ] ) .    in principle",
    ", the results for f , d , and af orientations must eventually extrapolate to the same location of the critical boundary as @xmath43 .",
    "the way finite@xmath17 data vary as @xmath17 increases is consistent with this , see figs .",
    "[ fig : lowt ] and  [ fig : prg ] .",
    "however , it is apparent that subdominant corrections to scaling have much larger amplitude for af than for f or d. attempting a theoretical understanding of why this is so usually becomes a highly nontrivial task , as it involves ( i ) unequivocally identifying the associated irrelevant exponents , and ( ii ) once this is done , analysing the ( non - universal ) amplitudes of the corresponding terms .",
    "examples of this can be seen in refs .   and  . here , for practical reasons we chose to extrapolate only the sets of @xmath66 data for which the small subdominant corrections could be satisfactorily dealt with via eq .",
    "( [ eq : fs1 ] ) and its underlying assumptions .",
    "we have found that the minimum amount of discrepancy among all our results corresponds to the set of : ( i ) extrapolated data from the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conf - inv ] ) , with the tm along d , using @xmath69 ; ( ii ) prg with the tm along d , and ( iii ) prg with the tm along f. see fig .",
    "[ fig : extr2 ] . the extrapolations from the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conf - inv ] ) , with the tm along f , and using @xmath69 , also agree very well with these , except for the low - temperature shoulder where curves begin to depart more significantly from the horizontal line @xmath30 .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : extr2 ] .    in order to check on the universality of critical properties",
    ", we examined the thermal exponent @xmath109 along the critical line .",
    "considering two strips of widths @xmath110 and @xmath17 , finite - size scaling  @xcite gives : @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 are derivatives of the inverse correlation lengths , taken with respect to the appropriate temperature - like scaling field , evaluated on the critical curve . with the tm along d , and using @xmath114 , we swept the extrapolated line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : extr2 ] . for simplicity ,",
    "the temperature - like direction was taken as the temperature axis for low and middle fields @xmath115 ( corresponding to @xmath116 ) , and as the @xmath10-axis for the remainder of the critical line .",
    "the resulting solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : y_prg ] ) , for @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath60 , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : yt ] .",
    "although the abrupt jump at @xmath119 is an artifact , reflecting the above - mentioned ( and somewhat arbitrary ) change in the assumed scaling direction , one sees that on both sides of the discontinuity the estimates are rather close to the ising value @xmath0 , and systematically approach it with increasing @xmath17 . on the other hand , for @xmath120 ( where @xmath10 already differs by less than @xmath121 from the zero - temperature @xmath122 ) , crossover effects related to the energy level crossings at @xmath1 cause an extreme deterioration in our estimates .",
    "near the @xmath51 extreme of the critical curve , we have fitted our extrapolated curves to a parabolic shape : @xmath123 from which we get @xmath124 , to be compared with @xmath125 and @xmath126 , each coming from a slightly different implementation of the interface method  @xcite .",
    "note that the coefficient of a hypothetical linear term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc0 ] ) vanishes identically because the phase diagram is symmetric under field inversion , thus the scaling variable must depend on @xmath127 . for @xmath92",
    "this means that @xmath128 plus higher - order terms  @xcite .",
    "finally , we return to the exponentially vanishing deviations from a horizontal line near @xmath1 , predicted in earlier work and mentioned in the introduction . these are of the general form  @xcite @xmath129 where @xmath130 for both implementations of the interface method  @xcite , as well as for a free - fermion approximation  @xcite , whereas @xmath131 for the linear - chain approximation  @xcite ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath9 turn out to be of order unity in all cases ) .",
    "while we do not have enough accuracy at low temperatures to probe for this sort of effect , it seems safe to state that any stronger deviations from the horizontal , be they in the shape of a reentrance or the opposite , are ruled out by our results .",
