    "since the advent of the high speed ccd photometry , many studies have been performed concerning the variability of dwarf novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which have led a significant progress in understanding many aspects of dwarf novae - outburst .",
    "wz sge stars , an extreme subclass of su uma - type dwarf novae , show many peculiarities both in outburst and quiescence .",
    "one of the enigmatic phenomenon is that they exhibit so called `` early superhumps '' on the early stage of the superoutburst of wz sge stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the period of the humps is almost identical to that of the orbital period of the system .",
    "another peculiarity is that most of wz sge stars show rebrightenings ( @xcite ; @xcite ) after the main outburst .",
    "extensive monitoring of wz sge stars , as well as insightful theoretical works , have shed some light on elucidating these origin and revealing the diversity of them , while less than ten objects have been certified as this class .",
    "however , interpretation of the aforementioned phenomena is controversial .",
    "recently , there has arisen a new problem regarding the evolution of dwarf novae . according to a population synthesis",
    ", there should be more dwarf novae below the period gap than observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite further suggested that almost all of cvs should have the orbital period below the period gap .",
    "however , observations indicate that the number of cvs above the period gap is comparable to that of cvs below the period gap @xcite .",
    "another calculation suggests the  theoretical period minimum  of dwarf novae will lie as short as 64 min @xcite under the secular evolution .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , has shown that the `` period minimum '' becomes around 80 min by an inclusion of an effect of a circumbinary disk .",
    "after reaching the `` period minimum '' , the system comprises a degenerate secondary , which gives rise to inversion of the mass - radius relation .",
    "then the orbital period of the system will become longer as the cv evolves .",
    "meanwhile , well accepted is that the `` observational period minimum '' lies around 78 min .",
    "as far as the evolutional scenario of dwarf novae is concerned , intensive studies should be awaited especially from the theoretical side ( see @xcite for a review . ) .",
    "tss j022216.4 + 412259.9 was firstly discovered by @xcite as a candidate of an ongoing supernova on 2005 november 16.1 ( ut ) with about 15.5 mag .",
    "the object maintained almost the same magnitude until 2005 november 17.1 ( ut ) , which was confirmed by 45 cm rotse - iiib telescope at the mcdonald observatory .",
    "negative observations were carried out at the same site , giving 16.5 mag as an upper limit on 2005 november 15.1 ( ut ) . on 2005",
    "november 18 , an optical spectrum was obtained with a 2.2 m telescope located on the university of hawaii , which revealed the dwarf nova nature of the eruptive object by unambiguous detection of h@xmath0 and heii 4686  in emission , as well as a blue continuum @xcite .",
    "there is no optical counterpart in usno b1.0 and 2mass catalog within the 5 arcsec circle .",
    "this suggests that the quiescent magnitude of the object is fainter than 21 mag .    in this letter",
    ", we report on the results of ccd photometric observations during the 2005 november long outburst of tss 022216.4 + 412259.9 ( hereafter , aliased tss j0222 ) , mainly focusing on detection of two periodicities during the outburst plateau stage .",
    "detailed discussion will be published in the forthcoming paper .",
    "time - resolved ccd photometry was carried out from 2005 november 21 to 2005 december 14 at 4 sites using 25 - 60 cm telescopes .",
    "more information about each site is described in table 1 .",
    "the total data points exceeded 10000 .",
    "typical exposure time was 10 - 30 sec with no filter .",
    "the resultant band pass is close to r@xmath1-band .",
    "the differential magnitude among each sites was adjusted to that of the kyoto site .",
    "we used usno@xmath2a2.0 1275@xmath201425512 ( @xmath3 = 12.8 , @xmath4 = 12.6 ) as a comparison star , whose constancy was checked by several stars in the same image .",
    "figure 1 illustrates a finding chart of tss j0222 .",
    "kyoto team used java - based psf photometry package developed by one of authors ( tk ) .",
    "hida and saitama used iraf daophot and apphot .",
    "data of mie were analysed by fitsphot4.1 .",
    "because of the faintness of tss j0222 , accurate calibration of the magnitude was prevented on some nights .",
    "however , such uncertainty would not influence on the following analysis in which we mainly focus on the periodicity of photometric variations .",
    "heliocentric correction is also made for our whole run .",

    "figure 2 displays the overall light curve of this outburst . at the onset of our observations ,",
    "tss j0222 was at the magnitude of 16.4 .",
    "after that the magnitude linearly faded down with the rate of 0.1 mag d@xmath6 .",
    "some wz sge stars show a rapid decline just after the maximum brightness with @xmath7 0.5 mag d@xmath6 , presumably due to viscous decay in the accretion disk @xcite . in the case of tss j0222",
    ", we can not specify such a rapid declining took place due to the lack of the our run at the early stage of the superoutburst .",
    "after the end of the main plateau stage , tss j0222 faded down as faint as our detection limit ( @xmath7 19.5 mag ) on hjd 2453706 .",
    "however , we detected a rebrightening on hjd 2453708 at the magnitude of 18.8 .",
    "judging from figure 2 , the rebrightening lasted at least 9 days . because of an intrinsic faintness of tss j0222 , we could not specify the overall feature of the rebrightenings .",
    "phenomenologically , three types of rebrightenings may exist .",
    "al com and wz sge itself kept bright for a week or even more , although about 1 mag - fluctuations were observed with a time scale of a few days in wz sge .",
    "the overall light curves of rebrightenings are not discrete , but somewhat long - lasting . here",
    "we call this type of rebrighenings `` type - a '' . on the other hand ,",
    "regular rebrightenings were seen in eg cnc . here",
    "we call this kind of rebrightenings `` type - b '' . finally , not only wz sge stars but also some su uma stars show a short rebrightening .",
    "such systems include rz leo @xcite .",
    "we call `` type - c '' for the rebrightening",
    ". the observed rebrightening of tss j0222 apparently belongs to the `` type - a '' category .",
    "the reason why different rebrightenings emerge even in the same system , is not known ( for a relevant paper , see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite).footnotefor example , wz sge shows two types of rebrightenings . in 1978 and 2001 superoutburst , the object exhibited the type - a rebrightening , while no rebrightening was observed in 1946 superoutbutst ( @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "figure 3 displays enlarged light curves on hjd 2453696 and hjd 2453697 .",
    "there is almost no feature on hjd 2453696 at a glance .",
    "however , double - peaked features can be seen when the data of hjd 2453695 and hjd 2453696 are folded with 0.054868 days ( discussed later ) . as for the light curve on hjd 2453697 , we can clearly see a rapid - rise and a slow decline feature , which is typical for the superhump profile .",
    "we suggest that some kind of transition took place between hjd 2453696 and hjd 2453697 , and that the feature we observed on hjd 2453697 was genuine superhumps , as is observed in su uma stars during superoutbursts .",
    "this kind of transition has been observed in wz sge stars amid the plateau stage ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we can reasonably conclude that we did observe early superhumps on hjd 2453695 and hjd 2453696 , and genuine superhumps from hjd 2453697 on , respectively .",
    "the results of period analyses during the plateau phase are represented in figure 4 . after subtracting a linear decline trend for each run",
    ", we performed the phase dispersion minimization method ( pdm , @xcite ) for the data obtained on hjd 2453695 and hjd 2453696 , corresponding to the early superhump phase ( upper panel ) , and for following 7 days , corresponding to the genuine superhump phase ( lower panel ) , respectively .",
    "the statistical errors were estimated by using lafler - kinman class method @xcite . as can be obviously seen in figure 4 , two different periodicities",
    "were exhibited : 0.054868(98 ) days for early superhumps , and 0.055544(26 ) days for genuine superhumps , respectively .",
    "the statistical errors were estimated by using lafler - kinman class method @xcite .",
    "the statistical f - tests yielded significance levels of the signals 74@xmath8 for early superhumps and",
    "83@xmath8 for genuine superhumps , respectively .",
    "note that the resultant superhump period is the shortest record among wz sge stars , exceeding 0.05648(2 ) days of v592 her @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows averaged light curves during these stages folded by the periods obtained above . note that the profile of the upper panel is not singly peaked , but definitely doubly peaked , similar to that observed in the early phase of wz sge and al com @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the lower panel illustrates a singly peaked profile . the rapid rise and slow decline of the profile are quite typical for superhumps of su uma stars .",
    "the present superoutburst of tss j0222 showed two types of humps , a rebrightening , and a large - amplitude of the eruption larger than 6 mag , all of which are characteristic of wz sge stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "judging from the results mentioned before , we can reasonably conclude that tss j0222 is a new member of wz sge stars with the shortest period ever known .",
    "we further investigated the mass ratio of the object based on an empirical relation derived by @xcite as follows :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the fractional superhump excess and mass ratio , respectively .",
    "because the radial velocity study has not been performed for tss j0222 , the orbital period of tss j0222 can not be exactly specified . however , taking into account the fact that the period of the early superhump is almost the same as that of the orbital period ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we can validly use the early superhump period above obtained ( 0.054868 days ) as the orbital period of tss j0222 .",
    "thus the fractional superhump excess is estimated as being 0.0123(23 ) with a little algebra . substituting this value into the equation ( 1 )",
    ", we obtained q = 0.054(10 ) .",
    "the value is quite a similar to that listed in @xcite for some wz sge stars .",
    "this implies that the mass of the secondary star might be as low as 0.075 @xmath12 even if the primary white dwarf reaches the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath10@xmath2@xmath13 diagram recently refined by @xcite , together with the data of tss j0222 derived above .",
    "note that the location of tss j0222 is close to that of wz sge and al com , rather than that of su uma - type dwarf novae with short orbital periods , e.g. , wx cet and sw uma .",
    "this suggests that tss j0222 bears some resemblance to wz sge and al com .",
    "in this letter , we reported on the newly discovered dwarf nova , tss j0222 .",
    "the obtained light curves provided enough evidence for early superhumps and genuine superhumps , characteristic of wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "we derived the superhump period was 0.055544(26 ) days , as well as the early superhump period of 0.054868(98 ) days .",
    "the value is the shortest period among wz sge stars .",
    "although a faintness of the object prevented an accurate calibration of magnitude after the post - plateau stage , we detected a long rebrightening during this stage , indicative of the wz sge nature of the system .",
    "the overall rebrightenings was classified into `` type - a '' in the letter , similar to those observed in the 1995 superoutburst of al com .",
    "assuming that the early superhump period is exactly the same as the orbital period , we roughly derived the mass ratio of tss j0222 to be 0.054(10 ) .",
    "this may indicate the mass of the secondary star is low , like wz sge and al com . in the future ,",
    "further observations with a large telescope should be performed to accurately determine the orbital period and the mass ratio of the system .",
    "we would express our gratitude to vsnet observers .",
