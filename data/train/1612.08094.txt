    "photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) is an emerging non - invasive tomographic imaging modality that allows high resolution imaging with high contrast .",
    "applications are ranging from breast screening in patients to whole body imaging of small animals @xcite .",
    "the basic principle of pat is as follows .",
    "if a semitransparent sample is illuminated with a short pulse , then parts of the optical energy are absorbed inside the sample ( see figure  [ fig : pat ] ) .",
    "this causes a rapid thermoelastic expansion , which in turns induces an acoustic pressure wave .",
    "the pressure wave is measured outside of the sample and used for reconstructing an image of the interior .",
    "basic principle of pat .",
    "pulsed optical illumination and subsequent thermal expansion induces an acoustic pressure wave .",
    "the pressure wave is measured outside of the object and used to obtain an image of the interior.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in this paper we work with the standard model of pat , where the acoustic pressure @xmath0 solves the standard wave equation @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the spatial dimension , @xmath3 the absorbed energy distribution , @xmath4 the spatial laplacian , and @xmath5 the derivative with respect to the time variable @xmath6 .",
    "the speed of sound is assumed to be constant and has been rescaled to one .",
    "we further suppose that @xmath7 vanishes outside an open ball @xmath8 .",
    "the goal of pat is to recover the function @xmath7 from measurements of @xmath9 .",
    "evaluation of @xmath10 is referred to as the direct problem and the problem of reconstructing @xmath7 from ( possibly approximate ) knowledge of @xmath11 as the inverse problem of pat .",
    "the cases @xmath12 and @xmath13 are of actual relevance in pat ( see @xcite ) .    in the recent years",
    "several solution methods for the inverse problem of pat have been derived .",
    "these approaches can be classified in direct methods on the one and iterative ( model based ) approaches on the other hand .",
    "direct methods are based on explicit solutions for inverting the operator @xmath10 that can be implemented numerically .",
    "this includes time reversal ( see @xcite ) , fourier domain algorithms ( see @xcite ) , and explicit reconstruction formulas of the back - projection type ( see @xcite ) .",
    "model based iterative approaches , on the other hand , are based on a discretization of the forward problem together with numerical solution methods for solving the resulting system of linear equations .",
    "existing iterative approaches use interpolation based discretization ( see @xcite ) or approximation using radially symmetric basis functions ( see @xcite ) . recently , also iterative schemes using a continuous domain formulation of the adjoint",
    "have been studied , see @xcite .",
    "direct methods are numerically efficient and robust and have similar complexity as numerically evaluating the forward problem .",
    "iterative methods typically are slower since the forward and adjoint problems have to be evaluated repeatedly .",
    "however , iterative methods have the advantage of being flexible as one can easily add regularization terms and incorporate measurement characteristics such as finite sampling , finite bandwidth and finite detectors size ( see @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , iterative methods tend to be more accurate in the case of noisy data .      in this paper",
    "we develop a galerkin approach for pat that combines advantages of direct and model based approaches .",
    "our method comes with a clear convergence theory , sharp error estimates and an efficient implementation .",
    "the galerkin least squared method for @xmath14 consists in finding a minimizer of the restricted least squares functional , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a finite dimensional reconstruction space and @xmath17 an appropriate hilbert space norm . if @xmath18 is a basis of @xmath16 then @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the unique solution of the galerkin equation @xmath21 we call the matrix @xmath22 the ( discrete ) imaging matrix .    in general",
    ", both the computation of the imaging matrix as well as the solution of the galerkin equation can be numerically expensive . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that for the inverse problem of pat , both issues can be efficiently implemented .",
    "these observations are based on the following :    * isometry property . using the isometry property of @xcite",
    "one shows that the entries of the system matrix are given by @xmath23 ; see  theorem [ thm : leastsquares ] . * shift invariance . if , additionally , we take the basis functions @xmath24 as translates of a single generating function @xmath25 , then @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "consequently only @xmath28 inner products have to be computed in our galerkin approach opposed to @xmath29 inner products required in the general case .",
    "further , the resulting shift invariant structure of the system matrix allows to efficiently solve the galerkin equation .    note that shift invariant spaces are frequently employed in computed tomography and",
    "include splines spaces , spaces of bandlimited functions , or spaces generated by kaiser - bessel functions . in this paper",
    "we will especially use kaiser - bessel functions which are often considered as the most suitable basis for computed tomography @xcite .",
    "for the use in pat they have first been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of existing galerkin approaches for tomographic image reconstruction exploiting isometry and shift invariance .",
    "however , we anticipate that similar methods can be derived for other tomographic problems , where an isometry property is known ( such as x - ray based ct  @xcite ) .",
    "we further note that our approach has close relations to the method of approximate inverse , which has frequently been applied to computed tomography @xcite . instead of approximating the unknown function using a prescribed reconstruction space ,",
    "the method of approximate inverse recovers prescribed moments of the unknown and is somehow dual to the galerkin approach .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : galerkinpat ] we apply the galerkin least squares method for the inverse problem of pat . by using the isometry property",
    "we derive a simple characterization of the galerkin equation in theorem  [ thm : leastsquares ] .",
    "we derive a convergence and stability result for the galerkin least squares method applied to pat ( see theorem  [ thm : convg ] ) . in section  [ sec : spaces ] we study shift invariant spaces for computed tomography . as the main results in that section we derive an estimate for the @xmath30-approximation error using elements from the shift invariant space . in section  [ sec : galerkinshift ] we present details for the galerkin approach using subspaces of shift invariant spaces .",
    "in section [ sec : num ] we present numerical studies using our galerkin approach and compare it to related approaches in the literature .",
    "the paper concludes with a conclusion and a short outlook in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "throughout the following , suppose @xmath31 , let @xmath32 denote the open ball with radius @xmath33 centered at the origin , and let @xmath34 denote the hilbert space of all square integrable functions which vanish outside @xmath35 .",
    "for two measurable functions @xmath36 we write @xmath37 provided that the integral exists .",
    "we further denote by @xmath38 the hilbert space of all functions @xmath39 with @xmath40 .      for initial data @xmath41 consider the wave equation .",
    "the solution @xmath42 of restricted to the boundary of @xmath35 is denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "the associated operator is defined by @xmath44    1 .",

    "+ [ lem : iso2 ] , [ lem : iso3 ] : item  [ lem : iso1 ] implies that @xmath10 is bounded with respect to the norms of @xmath52 and @xmath38 and defined on a dense subspace of @xmath52 .",
    "consequently it uniquely extends to a bounded operator @xmath48 .",
    "the continuity of the inner product finally shows the isometry property on @xmath52 .",
    "we call @xmath10 the acoustic forward operator . pat",
    "is concerned with the inverse problem of estimating @xmath7 from potentially noisy and approximate knowledge of @xmath53 . in this paper",
    "we use the galerkin least squares method for that purpose .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 be families of subspaces of @xmath56 and @xmath38 , respectively , with @xmath57 . further let @xmath58 denote the orthogonal projection on @xmath59 and suppose @xmath60 .",
    "the galerkin method for solving @xmath14 defines the approximate solution @xmath61 as the solution of @xmath62 in this paper we consider the special case where @xmath63 , in which case the solution of is referred to as _ galerkin least squares method_. the name comes from the fact that in this case the galerkin solution can be uniquely characterized as the minimizer of least squares functional over @xmath16 , @xmath64 because @xmath65 is a quadratic functional on a finite dimensional space and @xmath10 is injective , posses a unique solution . together with the isometry property",
    "we obtain the following characterizations of the least squares galerkin method for pat .",
    "[ thm : leastsquares ] for @xmath66 and @xmath67 the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "[ thm : leastsquares1 ] @xmath68 ; 2 .",
    "[ thm : leastsquares3 ] @xmath69 minimizes the least squares functional ; 3 .",
    "[ thm : leastsquares2 ] for an arbitrary basis @xmath70 of @xmath16 , we have @xmath71 where * @xmath72 with @xmath73 ; * @xmath74 ; * @xmath75 .",

    "another standard characterization shows the equivalence of [ thm : leastsquares1 ] and [ thm : leastsquares2 ] with the system matrix @xmath76 .",
    "now , the isometry property given in lemma [ lem : iso ] shows @xmath77 and concludes the proof .    in general , evaluating the matrix entries @xmath78 can be difficult .",
    "for many basis functions an explicit expression for @xmath79 is not available including the natural pixel basis , spaces defined by linear interpolation , or spline spaces .",
    "hence @xmath79 has to be evaluated numerically which is time consuming and introduces additional errors .",
    "even if @xmath79 is given explicitly , then the inner products @xmath80 have to be computed numerically and stored . for large @xmath81 this can be problematic and time consuming .",
    "in contrast , by using the isometry property in our approach we only have to compute the inner products @xmath82 .",
    "further , in computed tomography it is common to take @xmath83 as translates of a single function @xmath84 .",
    "in such a situation the inner products satisfy @xmath85 and therefore only a small fraction of all inner products actually have to be computed .      as another consequence of the isometry property",
    "we derive linear error estimates for the galerkin approach to pat .",
    "we consider noisy data where the data @xmath86 is known to satisfy @xmath87 for some noise level @xmath88 and unknown @xmath89 . for noisy data we define the galerkin least squares solution by @xmath90 we then have the following convergence and stability result .",
    "[ thm : convg ] let @xmath89 , @xmath86 , @xmath88 satisfy and let @xmath91 be defined by .",
    "then , the following error estimate for the galerkin method holds : @xmath92    we start with the noise free case @xmath93 . the definition of @xmath91 and the isometry property of @xmath10 yield @xmath94 this shows @xmath95 and yields for @xmath93 .",
    "now consider the case of arbitrary @xmath96 .",
    "because @xmath97 is closed we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath98 .",
    "the data therefore takes the form @xmath99 for some @xmath100 . as in the case",
    "@xmath101 we easily verify @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , by the triangle inequality and the isometry property of @xmath10 we obtain @xmath103 together with @xmath104 this concludes the proof .    the error estimate in theorem  [ thm : convg ] depends on two terms : the first term depends on the approximation properties of the space @xmath16 and the second term on the noise level @xmath96 . as easily verified both terms are optimal and can not be improved .",
    "the second term shows stability of our galerkin least squares approach . under the reasonable assumption that the spaces @xmath16 satisfy the denseness property @xmath105",
    "the derived error estimate further implies convergence of the galerkin approach .",
    "in many tomographic and signal processing applications , natural spaces for approximating the underlying function are subspaces of shift invariant spaces . in this paper we consider spaces @xmath106 that are generated by translated and scaled versions of a single function @xmath107 , @xmath108 here @xmath109 denotes the linear hull , and @xmath110 stands for the closure with respect to @xmath111 of a set @xmath112 and @xmath113 we have chosen the normalization of the generating functions @xmath114 in such a way that @xmath115 for all @xmath116 . in this section",
    "we derive conditions such that any @xmath30 function can be approximated by elements in @xmath117 .",
    "further , we present examples of generating functions that are relevant for ( photoacoustic ) computed tomography .",
    "any tomographic reconstruction method uses , either explicitly or implicitly , a particular discrete reconstruction space .",
    "this is obvious for any iterative procedure as it requires a finite dimensional representation of the forward operator that can be evaluated numerically .",
    "however , also direct methods use an underlying discrete image space . for example , standard filtered backprojection algorithms usually reconstruct samples of a bandlimited approximation of the unknown function . in such a situation ,",
    "the underlying discrete signal space consists of bandlimited functions . in this paper",
    "we allow more general shift invariant spaces .",
    "the following properties of the generating function and the spaces @xmath117 have been reported desirable for tomographic applications ( see @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "[ v1 ] @xmath118 has `` small '' spatial support ; 2 .",
    "[ v2 ] @xmath118 is rotationally invariant ; 3 .",
    "[ v3 ] @xmath119 is a riesz basis of @xmath117 ; 4 .",
    "[ v4 ] @xmath118 satisfies the so called partition of unity property .    conditions [ v1 ] and [ v2 ] are desirable from a computational point of view and often help to derive efficient reconstruction algorithms .",
    "the properties [ v3 ] and [ v4 ] are of more fundamental nature as these conditions imply that any @xmath30 function can be approximated arbitrarily well by elements in @xmath117 as @xmath120 ( with @xmath121 kept fixed ; the so called stationary case ) . in @xcite",
    "it has been pointed out that the properties [ v1]-[v4 ] can not be simultaneously fulfilled .",
    "this implies that for taking @xmath121 independent of @xmath122 , the spaces @xmath117 have a limited approximation capability in the sense that for a typical function @xmath7 , the approximation error @xmath123 does not converge to zero as @xmath124 and @xmath121 is kept fixed .    despite these negative results , radially symmetric basis functions are of great popularity in computed tomography ( see for example , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we therefore propose to also allow the shift parameter @xmath121 to be variable . under reasonable assumptions",
    "we show that the approximation error converges to zero for @xmath125 .",
    "this convergence in particularly holds for radially symmetric generating functions having some decay in the fourier space , including generalized kaiser - bessel functions which are the most popular choice in tomographic image reconstruction .",
    "recall that the family @xmath126 is called a riesz basis of @xmath117 if there exist @xmath127 such that @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the squared @xmath130-norm of @xmath131 .",

    "we do not investigate this issue further since our main emphasis is pointing out that allowing @xmath121 to vary yields asymptotically vanishing approximation error without the partition of unity property .",
    "this is relevant since the partition of unity property can not be satisfied by any radially symmetric compactly supported function . below we study two basic examples for generating functions where theorems  [ thm : aerror ] and  [ thm : conv ] can be applied .",
    "these are pixel ( or voxel ) basis functions and generalized kaiser - bessel functions .",
    "we focus on these basis functions since the pixel basis has been the most common choice in early tomographic image reconstruction while generalized kaiser - bessel functions are currently considered as the method of choice .",

    "it consists of scaled and translated version of the indicator function of the hyper - cube @xmath226 @xmath227 for every @xmath228 , the family @xmath229 with @xmath230 clearly forms a riesz basis of @xmath231 in order to investigate the approximation properties of @xmath232 , note that the fourier transform of @xmath233 is given by @xmath234 where @xmath235 for @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "we see @xmath238 as @xmath239 . from theorem  [ thm : aerror ]",
    "we therefore conclude that any of the spaces @xmath232 yields an asymptotically vanishing approximation error for @xmath125 ( when @xmath122 is bounded ) .",
    "the pixel basis also allows to consider the stationary case where @xmath121 is a constant and where @xmath122 tends to @xmath192 .",
    "in fact , from the proof of theorem  [ thm : aerror ] we see that @xmath233 satisfies the partition of unity property if and only if @xmath240 for every @xmath241 .",
    "this in turn is the case if and only if @xmath242 for some @xmath243 .",
    "the case @xmath153 seems the most natural one , since it uses non - overlapping basis functions filling the whole space @xmath244 .",
    "the non - overlapping case is in fact used in existing tomographic image reconstruction algorithms ; see @xcite .",
    "further , note that the number of basis elements @xmath245 for which its center @xmath246 is contained in the unit cube @xmath247^d$ ] is given by @xmath248 and that @xmath122 is inversely proportional to the essential bandwidth of the basis function .",
    "therefore , the choice @xmath153 yields to a minimal number of pixel basis functions representing a function with given support and essential bandwidth .",
    "as often argued in the literature on tomographic image reconstruction , the lack of continuity and rotation invariance are severe drawbacks of the pixel basis functions for image reconstruction . therefore in @xcite the generalized kaiser - bessel ( kb ) functions",
    "have been introduced and proposed for image reconstruction .    the generalized kb functions in @xmath244 form a family of functions that depend on three parameters @xmath243 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is referred to as the order , @xmath249 the taper parameter and @xmath252 is the support parameter .",
    "more precisely , the kb function @xmath253 of order @xmath254 is defined by @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the modified first kind bessel function .",
    "the window taper @xmath257 describes how spiky the basis function is and @xmath258 is the support radius .",
    "the order allows to control the smoothness and the taper parameter allows to further tune the shape of the basis function .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath259 of the kb function @xmath260 can be computed to ( see @xcite ) @xmath261 here @xmath262 denotes the first kind bessel function of order @xmath254 .",
    "the known asymptotic decay @xmath263 implies that the asymptotic behavior of the generalized kb function is @xmath264 . from theorem  [ thm : aerror ]",
    "we therefore conclude that for any choice of @xmath254 , @xmath258 and @xmath257 , the spaces @xmath265 yield vanishing approximation error when @xmath125 and @xmath122 keeps bounded .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath258 plays exactly the same roles as the parameter @xmath122 . therefore without loss of generality one could omit @xmath258 in the definition of the kb functions .",
    "however we include it since it is standard to consider the kb functions as a family of three parameters .",
    "note that the kb function ( as any other radially symmetric basis function with compact support ) does not satisfy the partition of unity condition .",
    "therefore theorem [ thm : aerror ] implies ( for sufficiently regular functions ) that the asymptotic approximation error saturates ; that is , we have @xmath266 keeping @xmath267 , @xmath268 and @xmath153 fixed , in @xcite it has been proposed to select the taper parameter @xmath257 in such a way that the asymptotic approximation error given by @xmath269 is minimized .",
    "although such a procedure does not overcome the saturation phenomenon , the saturation effect ( for given order and given redundancy factor ) is minimized .",

    "in this section we give details how to efficiently implement the least squares galerkin method using subspaces of a shift invariant space .",
    "this is in contrast to the use of a general reconstruction space , where both the computation of the system matrix and the solution of the galerkin equation can be slow . for shift invariant spaces",
    "the system matrix takes a very special form which allows an efficient implementation .",
    "let @xmath270 be such that the elements @xmath114 form a riesz basis of @xmath117 ; see section  [ sec : spaces ] .",
    "moreover , let @xmath271 and @xmath272 be two sequences of positive numbers describing the support and the redundancy of the basis functions , respectively .",
    "we consider the reconstruction spaces @xmath273 where @xmath274 are the basis functions ( with @xmath275 as in ) , and @xmath276 denotes the set of all @xmath277 such that the mid - point @xmath278 of the @xmath172-th basis function is contained in @xmath279 .",
    "then @xmath280 is the number of basis elements used for image representation .",
    "when applied with the reconstruction space @xmath281 our galerkin approach to pat analyzed in section  [ sec : galerkinpat ] takes the form ( see theorem  [ thm : leastsquares ] ) @xmath282 where    * @xmath75 is the system matrix ; * @xmath74 is the right hand side ; * @xmath72 solves the galerkin equation @xmath283 .",
    "as discussed in the following subsection , for the shift invariant case the system matrix @xmath284 takes a very special form which significantly simplifies the computations .",
    "further , for our choices of the basis functions the right hand can be computed efficiently as described in subsection [ sec : rhs ] below .      for any @xmath285 and any @xmath286 ,",
    "the entries of the system matrix @xmath22 satisfy @xmath287 hence instead of computing and storing the whole system matrix required by standard galerkin methods , in our approach only the values @xmath288 where @xmath289 with @xmath290 have to be computed and stored .",
    "the total number of such inner products is bounded by @xmath291 . in the case where @xmath118 has small support",
    "this number is actually much smaller since @xmath292 vanishes if the supports of @xmath293 and @xmath294 do not overlap .    in this paper",
    "we consider the ( non - overlapping ) pixel basis ( see subsection  [ sec : ex : pixel ] ) and the kb functions in two spatial dimensions ( see subsection  [ sec : ex : kb ] ) .",
    "the pixel basis is an orthonormal system and therefore the system matrix is the identity .",

    "we approximate the right hand side in the galerkin equation as follows : @xmath311 here @xmath312 are appropriate weights accounting for the density of the sampling points .",
    "the right hand side in   may be interpreted as the exact inner product @xmath313 for some approximate data @xmath314 , which allows application of our convergence and stability result derived in theorem  [ thm : conv ] .    in some situations ( for example for the kb functions and other radially symmetric basis functions in three dimensions ) , the solution of @xmath79 is available analytically ( see  @xcite ) . in our numerical solutions we use the pixel basis and the kb basis functions two spatial dimensions , where we are not aware of explicit representations for the corresponding solution of the wave equation . in this case",
    "we numerically compute @xmath315 using the well known solution formula for the wave equation , @xmath316 here @xmath317 denote the spherical means transform of a function @xmath318 with support in @xmath319 , and the abel transform of a function @xmath320 in the second variable , respectively .",
    "the solution formula is used to numerically compute @xmath79 required for evaluating the right hand side of the galerkin equation as outlined in the following .    * for a symmetric basis function of the form @xmath321 the corresponding solution of the wave equation also is radially symmetric .",
