    "variability in non - magnetic , cataclysmic variable ( cv ) close binaries has been largely attributed to instabilities .",
    "the outbursts in cv recurrent novae ( rn ) and cv classical novae ( cn ) can be caused by thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a white dwarf or by a thermal and viscous instability in the disc .",
    "the latter type of outburst involves cycling from low - to - high thermal and viscous states ( see e.g. , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 and references within ) , and thus cycling from low - to - high mass transfer rates ( see e.g. , lasota 2001 ) , that results in a release of accretion energy as mass is drained onto the white dwarf .",
    "transient x - ray binaries with neutron stars or black hole primaries and cv dwarf novae ( dn ) are also subject to thermal and viscous instabilities .",
    "however , the thermal and viscous instabilities in cv rn are larger in scale than those in cv dn .",
    "in addition to thermal and viscous instabilities , cv dn can experience a tidal instability .",
    "results are cv dn su uma and nova - like ( nl ) outbursts .",
    "the larger amplitude and longer duration superoutbursts involve both a thermal - viscous instability and a tidal instability .",
    "both cv dn su uma and nl outbursts and superoutbursts show characteristic hump - shaped modulations , known as positive superhumps , in their light curves .",
    "these positive superhump modulations have a period that is a few percent longer than the orbital period .",
    "they could be caused by dissipation from spiral shocks that formed from converging gas flows in the middle and outer annuli of the disc ( see e.g. , smith et al .",
    "the source to this spiral shock generation is the @xmath2 resonance ( lubow 1991a , b ) , using the terminology established by frank , king , & raine ( 1992 ) .",
    "a competing theory has also been suggested by bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) - the superoutburst is associated with the generation of an spiral density wave in inner annuli of the disc , a zone that is denser and gas - dynamically un - perturbed",
    ". this inner spiral density wave contributes to a substantial increase in mass transfer rate in that region .",
    "in addition to positive superhumps , some non - magnetic cv dn systems show negative superhumps in their light curves .",
    "these negative superhump modulations have a period that is a few percent shorter than the orbital period .",
    "some systems light curves only show negative superhumps ( e.g. , cn ori ) , or only show positive superhumps ( e.g. , su uma ) , or show both modulations simultaneously [ e.g. , sdss j210014.12 + 00446.0 ( olech et al . 2009 ) ] , or show one type of modulation only later to be replaced by the other [ e.g. , tt ari ( kim et al . 2009 ) ] .",
    "negative superhumps are suggested to be a consequence of a partially tilted disc ( patterson et al .",
    "1993 ) or are related to a warped accretion disc ( petterson 1977 ; murray & armitage 1998 ; terquem & papaloizou 2000 ; murray et al .",
    "2002 ; foulkes , haswell , & murray 2006 ) . our previous numerical simulation work",
    "( wood , montgomery , & simpson 2000 ; montgomery 2004 , montgomery 2009b ) shows that negative superhumps can be produced by a fully tilted disc , and these modulations have a shape and a period that are similar to those in observational light curves .",
    "accretion discs can warp or tilt via a potpourri of suggested sources .",
    "for example , disc tilt in x - ray binaries can be from gas streaming at an upward angle from the inner lagrange point for one half of the orbit and at a downward angle for the second half of the orbit ( boynton et al .",
    "1980 ) . in some cvs",
    ", a disc tilt can be held constant by gas stream being fed by the magnetic field of the secondary ( barrett , odonoghue , & warner , 1988 ) . also for cv systems",
    ", a disc tilt instability can result from a coupling of an eccentric instability to lindblad resonances ( lubow 1992 ) .",
    "a vertical resonant oscillation of the disc mid - plane can be caused by tidal interactions between a massive secondary and a coplanar primary ( lubow & pringle 1993 ) .",
    "a warping instability can be caused by irradiation from the primary ( pringle 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "a warping can be caused by direct tidal forces from a secondary that is on an inclined orbit .",
    "a disc warp can be caused by misalignments of the spin axis of a compact and/or magnetized primary and the disc axis .",
    "of these possibilities , murray & armitage ( 1998 ) find that cv dn accretion discs do not seem to tilt out of the orbital plane by instabilities .    if a warp is present , the warp may or may not propagate . as reviewed in pringle ( 1999 )",
    ", an inviscid , locally isothermal or locally polytropic fluid disc that has keplerian rotation , that is within a spherically symmetric gravitational potential , and that is wholly tilted by the same finite angle has azimuthal wavenumber @xmath3=1[and thus the fluid disc has ( @xmath3=1)-fold symmetry in the azimuthal direction ] and radial mode number @xmath4=0 ( and thus the fluid disc has @xmath4=0 local minima ) . for this disc ,",
    "the wave mode frequency is zero .",
    "if , however , not all of the inviscid disc is tilted by the same amount , then a wave can radially propagate ( see papaloizou & lin , 1995 and e.g. , lubow , ogilvie , & pringle , 2002 ) .",
    "if the disc has some viscosity , then a disc wave can only propagate if the viscosity is low and the tilt angle is approximately less than @xmath5 where @xmath6 is vertical disc thickness and @xmath7 is disc radius .",
    "if the disc has low viscosity , then the wave is transferred through the disc by wave action . likewise ,",
    "if the disc has high viscosity , then the wave is transferred through the disc by dispersion ( papaloizou & pringle , 1983 ) .",
    "if a quiescent , viscous disc is wholly tilted by the same amount and the tilt angle is greater than @xmath5 , a wave should not propagate .",
    "regardless of how an accretion disc tilts or warps and whether the wave propagates , non - coplanar accretion discs in binary systems precess in the retrograde direction ( i.e. , in the direction opposite to spin and orbital motion ) .",
    "retrograde precessional activity has been suggested for x - ray binaries ( e.g. , katz 1973 , larwood 1998 , wijers & pringle 1999 ) , for common systems that produce jets ( e.g. , livio 1999 ) , for protostars ( e.g. , papaloizou & terquem 1995 , larwood et . al . 1996 , larwood 1997 ) , for cv systems",
    "( bisikalo et al . 2003 , 2004 ) and for quasars and supermassive black holes ( e.g. , romero et al . 2000 , caproni & abraham 2002 ) , to name a few . in many of these binary systems ,",
    "the source to the retrograde precession is often suggested to be due to direct tidal forcing . in montgomery",
    "( 2009a ) , we show that tidal torques by the secondary on a tilted , spinning accretion disc is a source to retrograde precession .",
    "a more familiar example is the tidal torque by the sun and moon on the oblate , spinning , tilted earth that causes the earth s first point of aries to precess retrogradely .    of note",
    "is that some find retrograde precession occurring within a disc even though the entire accretion disc remains coplanar with the orbit : in numerical simulations by bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) , a coplanar inner spiral density wave is generated within the inner annuli of a coplanar accretion disc and only the coplanar spiral density wave retrogradely precesses .",
    "based on their numerical simulations , the wave is generated by sheared elliptical orbits and these sheared elliptical orbits ( and thus the wave ) retrogradely precess .",
    "bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that the retrograde precession is due to an influence by the mass - losing star by the processes discussed in kumar ( 1986 ) and warner ( 1995 , 2003 ) .",
    "however , kumar ( 1986 ) finds the retrograde precession on a tilted disc s @xmath8 annulus due to the tidal influence of the secondary .",
    "since the spiral density wave is found in inner annuli of the accretion disc , theory is needed on retrograde precession for a wave in this location .    in montgomery ( 2009a ) , we suggest that care must be taken in choosing the correct state of matter and the correct geometrical shape of the accretion disc as different shapes can produce different retrograde precessional values .",
    "for example , montgomery ( 2009a ) shows that retrograde precession of a non - magnetic , tilted cv dn gaseous accretion disc can best be described by a retrogradely precessing and differentially rotating tilted accretion disc , and superimposed on the disc is a rotating and precessing ring that is located near the innermost annuli of the disc .",
    "the superimposed ring is likely caused by gas stream overflow and additional particle migration into the innermost annuli of the tilted disc ( montgomery 2009a , b ) . instead of a precessing inner ring in accretion discs , some accretion disc simulations show an inner spiral density wave in the same location : for semidetached binaries , bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) show a one - armed spiral shock wave is generated in inner annuli of cooler discs ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) of binaries with high secondary - to - primary mass ratios .",
    "therefore , a study is needed on whether such a wave can be generated in simulations of lower mass ratio , and can such a wave explain retrograde precession in cv dn systems .    in this work ,",
    "we generate theory on retrograde precession of an accretion disc that contains an inner spiral density wave .",
    "we assume the wave is within the plane of a quiescent disc , yet the disc is tilted five degrees relative to the orbital plane .",
    "we wish to establish whether replacing the precessing inner ring found in montgomery ( 2009a ) with an inner spiral density wave has similar effects on disc retrograde precession .",
    "to justify the disc geometry ( i.e .. disc with a coplanar inner spiral density wave ) , we generate a low mass ratio numerical simulation using the grid code of bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in  2 of this paper",
    ", we develop the theoretical expressions to describe a retrogradely precessing , tilted cv dn accretion disc that has an inner spiral density wave in the plane of the disc . in  3 , we describe the two numerical codes that generate retrograde precession in cv dn accretion discs and we present numerical simulation results . in  4 , we compare our theoretical and numerical results with results obtained from observations and with previously obtained results . in  5 , we discuss these comparisons , and in  6 , we provide a summary , conclusions , and future work .",
    "in the montgomery ( 2009b ) smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) numerical simulations of a differentially rotating , retrogradely precessing , tilted accretion disc , a ring forms near the innermost annuli of the disc due to particle migration into this inner annuli and due to gas stream overflow of the tilted disc edge . instead of a ring , numerical simulations by bisikalo et al .",
    "2004 ) show gas stream build - up in the form of a one - armed spiral density wave .",
    "therefore , we consider a hypothetical disc geometry for non - magnetic cv dn system that exhibits negative superhumps in their light curves .",
    "the hypothetical disc geometry is a combination of the disc geometries in both numerical simulations : we assume the disc is wholly tilted five or more degrees degrees relative to the orbital plane . instead of a denser ring of material in the innermost annuli of the disc , we assume an inner spiral density wave that remains in the plane of the tilted disc . in the following subsections ,",
    "we find the disc s net retrograde precessional value .      the retrograde precessional angular frequency of a differentially rotating , circular , tilted disc",
    "is found to be ( see e.g. , montgomery , 2009a ) @xmath10 in this equation , @xmath11 is the mass ratio of the secondary - to - primary masses , @xmath12 is the obliquity angle , @xmath13 is the radius of the disc , @xmath14 is the orbital separation , and @xmath15 is the orbital frequency .",
    "this equation applies to a thin disc that lacks an inner hole or has a small inner hole ( e.g. , non - magnetic , cv dn systems ) .",
    "this disc also does not have any surface features such as spiral density waves or dense rings ( or winds , jets , planets , holes , gaps , or any other feature that may change the angular momentum , and thus moment of inertia , of the system ) .",
    "the shape of the disc is ideally circular although the equation is assumed applicable to non - circular discs as well ( see montgomery 2009a ) .",
    "equation ( 1 ) is valid so long as the disc precesses as a unit and the distance between the stars @xmath14 is much greater than the radius of the primary ( see montgomery 2009a ) .    the outer radius of the approximately circular disc is assumed to be    @xmath16    as given by paczynski ( 1977 ) .",
    "this equation is valid for mass ratios in the range @xmath17 .    as retrograde precession",
    "is associated with tilted discs and as negative superhumps are generated when disc tilt is high enough ( see montgomery 2009b ) , then negative superhumps could be an observational beacon that indicates that the disc may be tilted .",
    "as the negative superhump period @xmath18 and the orbital period @xmath19 are fairly precise clocks , we would like to relate the retrograde precessional period to these precise clocks . from observations ,",
    "we know that the orbital period is slightly longer than the negative superhump period .",
    "both periods are related to the net retrograde precession period by    @xmath20    if we assume a primary mass @xmath21=0.8@xmath22 and mass ratio @xmath23 , then the secondary mass @xmath24=0.32@xmath22 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( montgomery 2009b ) . from newton",
    "s version of kepler s third law , the orbital period and the rotation period at the disc edge is @xmath27 hours and one hour , respectively . from montgomery ( 2009b ) , the negative superhump period for this mass ratio is @xmath28 3.662 hours and therefore , from equation ( 3 ) , @xmath2919.5@xmath3075 hours , assuming small angle approximation for disc tilt .",
    "notice that the spin rate at the edge of the disc is fast compared to the retrograde precessional rate .",
    "however , this type of precession is not fast precession because the wobble rate is not comparable to the spin rate . instead",
    ", this kind of precession is driven by torques ( see e.g. , montgomery 2009a ) .      to find the effects an inner spiral density wave has on retrograde precession , we first review the theory generated for cv dn accretion discs that progradely precess , that have spiral density waves , and that generate positive superhumps . from the location of the spiral density waves in a progradely precessing disc",
    ", we can find the location of the inner spiral density wave .",
    "spiral density waves contribute to retrograde precession through pressure as lubow ( 1992 ) finds for progradely precessing cv dn accretion discs that show positive superhumps in their light curves .",
    "lubow ( 1992 ) finds that the net prograde precession @xmath31 is the net of a dynamical component , a pressure component , and a transient component .",
    "of the three , the dynamical component contributes most to prograde precession .",
    "the second of the three is a retrograde component and is a correction term to the dynamical component .",
    "this pressure component is necessary to more correctly explain the net prograde precession in steady state discs .",
    "the third component is also a correction term and can contribute to the prograde dynamical component or to the retrograde pressure component .",
    "however , this transient component is most effective during the development stage of positive superhumps . if only quasi - steady state discs are considered , then this third component can be ignored .",
    "pressure effects within progradely precessing discs could be due to a two - armed spiral mode .",
    "the source to this spiral shock generation is the @xmath2 resonance ( lubow 1991a , b ) , using the terminology established by frank , king , & raine ( 1992 ) .",
    "dissipation from these spiral shocks are created from converging gas flows , and this dissipation is the source to the observed positive superhump as suggested by smith et al .",
    "the location of these spiral density waves is in the middle and outer annuli of the quasi - steady state disc ( see e.g. , smith et al . , 2007 ) .    assuming this disc geometry for prograde precession , an analytical expression for the pressure component is developed in lubow ( 1992 ) .",

    "notice that this equation is very similar to equation ( 4 ) , however this equation is evaluated at the radius @xmath64 of inner spiral density wave and hence the wave number and particle angular and radial frequencies are different .",

    "<S> in montgomery ( 2009a ) , we show that accretion discs in binary systems could retrogradely precess by the same physics that causes the earth to retrogradely precess [ i.e. , tidal torques by the moon and the sun ( or secondary star ) on a tilted , spinning , non - spherical earth ( or e.g. , primary star surrounded by an accretion disc ) ] . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the state of matter and the geometrical shape of the celestial object could significantly affect the precessional value . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) dwarf novae ( dn ) non - magnetic system that shows negative superhumps in its light curve can be described by a retrogradely precessing , differentially rotating , tilted disc . because the disc is a fluid and because the gas stream overflows the tilted disc and particles can migrate into inner disc annuli , coupled to the disc could be a retrogradely precessing inner ring that is located near the innermost annuli of the disc . however , numerical simulations by bisikalo et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2003 , 2004 ) and this work show that an inner spiral density wave can be generated instead of an inner ring . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we show that retrograde precession in non - magnetic , spinning , tilted cv dn systems can equally be described by a retrogradely precessing and differentially rotating disc with an attached retrogradely precessing inner spiral density wave so long as the wave appears at the same radius as the ring and within the plane of the tilted disc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the theoretical results generated in this work agree well with the theoretical results presented in montgomery ( 2009a ) and thus with the numerical simulations and select cv dn systems in montgomery ( 2009b ) that may have a main sequence secondary . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , pressure effects do need to be considered in cv dn systems that exhibit negative superhumps if the accretion discs are tilted and have an inner spiral density wave that is in the plane of the disc .     accretion discs with an inner spiral density wave    m.m . </S>",
