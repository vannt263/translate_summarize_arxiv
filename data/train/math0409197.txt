    "an interesting question here is whether we can decrease the bound @xmath24 to zero with the sample size @xmath2 and yet guarantee the strong consistency of maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "if this is possible , the further question is how fast @xmath25 can decrease to zero .",
    "this question is similar to the ( so far open ) problem stated in hathaway(1985 ) , which treats mixtures of normal distributions with constraints imposed on the ratios of variances .",

    "random sample of size @xmath26 is generated from @xmath27 and the model is @xmath28 . despite the limited resolution in figure [ simlation : fig ] , there are actually @xmath26 peaks of the likelihood function as @xmath29 .",
    "we see that although the likelihood function diverges to infinity at these peaks , the divergence takes place only for very small @xmath30 and the likelihood function is well - behaved for most of the ranges of @xmath30 .",
    "this suggests that the bound @xmath25 can decrease to zero fairly quickly while maintaining the consistency of maximum likelihood estimator .",

    "we give a simulation result and some discussions .",
    "in this section , we consider the identifiability and strong consistency of finite mixtures .",
    "the properties of finite mixtures treated in this section concerns general finite mixture distributions .",

    "@xmath37 are called the components of the mixture .",

    "when all components @xmath45 belong to the same parametric family , then @xmath46 is invariant under the permutations of the component labels . because of this trivial unidentifiability , the definition of identifiability for the mixture densities can be weakened as described in teicher(1960 ) , yakowitz and spragins(1968 ) , mclachlan and peel(2000 ) and so on , so that @xmath47 implies @xmath48 and for each @xmath49 there exists some @xmath50 such that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "but , even under such a weakened definition , mixtures of density functions still have unidentifiability . for example",

    "then @xmath138 therefore mean log likelihood of the true model is dominated by that of other models and consistency of maximum likelihood estimator fails .",
    "as stated above in section [ sec : intro ] , the failure of consistency of maximum likelihood estimator is caused by the divergence of the likelihood of the model , where some scale parameters go to zero .",

    ".log likelihood of the true model and that of a competing model [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the second column of table [ sim : tab ] shows the log likelihood at @xmath143 .",

    "therefore with probability tending to 1 the support of @xmath146 does not contain two or more realized values for all @xmath147 $ ] .",
    "therefore the maximum of the likelihood is usually achieved when the support of @xmath146 contains just one realized value .",

    "the result in table [ sim : tab ] is based on one replication for each sample size .",

    "this simulation result is consistent with theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "we expect that our result can be extended to other finite mixture cases , especially for densities which are lipschitz continuous when the scale parameters are fixed . on the other hand , in theorem  [ thm : main ]",
    ", it might be difficult to weaken the assumption that there is no representation of the true model with less than @xmath31 components .",
