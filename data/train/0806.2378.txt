    "although a detailed analysis would go far beyond the scope of the present paper , we would like to sketch a possible method that could serve for detecting the hi experimentally ( complementing the observations in @xcite ) .",

    "is narrowed , as already noticed with a different experimental situation ( parametric resonance ) by @xcite .",
    "placing the bosonic chain in a washboard potential , the distinct feature of the hi phase would be a dependence of the atomic current on the length of the chain ( this is the analog of the diffusive spin transport evidenced in haldane compounds@xcite ) .",
    "we observe that , being an incompressible phase , the hi is expected to be robust to the parabolic confinement whenever the induced total energy offset ( between center and the trap edges ) is of the order of the energy gap . following the numerical indications provided in @xcite such a gap",
    "is estimated to be of the same order of magnitude of the mi one : @xmath201 .",
    "therefore we can estimate the magnitude of the allowed harmonic confinement to be @xmath202 , @xmath203 being the size of the condensate along the optical lattice",
    ". it would be interesting to trace the analogous for the hi of the `` wedding cake '' structure that appears in mi in presence of strong confinement .",
    "finally , ring shaped ( with circumference @xmath204 ) optical lattices with twisted boundary conditions@xcite could be exploited to evidence the hi in an expansion experiment ( we note that the energy offset due to harmonic confinement can be minimized in this case ) .",
    "in fact , adapting the results obtained for the spin diffusion in twisted heisenberg integer spin rings@xcite , the atomic density current would display a characteristic parametric dependence on the boundary twist : a sawtooth like behaviour for correlation lenght @xmath205 , and it would be exponentially suppressed , with sinusoidal oscillations for @xmath206 .",
    "this could be a fingerprint of the haldane gap for ( finite ) ultracold atomic systems .",
    "by exploiting a suitable expansion of the matrix elements in terms of the lattice attenuation parameter @xmath207 we derived an effective model for bosonic atoms in a @xmath0 lattice ( [ particlehamiltonian ] ) .",
    "additional terms enter the hamiltonian respect to the standard bose - hubbard model . for certain choice of the coupling constants , the model results to be integrable through a mapping with the spin-@xmath1-@xmath4 integrable model ( see eq.([smallanistropybis ] ) ) .",
    "we note that the possibility of independently tuning the onsite - interaction relative to the density - density interaction , is available in the bosonic model hamiltonian only in presence of dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "this is precisely what allows degenerate quantum gases to explore different portions of the phase diagram beyond the mi region .    the direct relation between the spin and bosonic pictures",
    "are exploited to investigate the critical properties of the bosonic systems . from the present work",
    ", it is suggested that the correct context is provided by the spin @xmath1 , @xmath104-@xmath105 model .",
