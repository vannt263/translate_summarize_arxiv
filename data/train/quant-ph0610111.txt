    "the requirements for realizing a fully functioning quantum computer are daunting .",
    "there must be a scalable system of qubits which can be initialized and individually measured",
    ". it must be possible to enact a universal set of quantum gates on these qubits . and all this must be done with sufficient accuracy so that quantum error correction can be used to prevent decoherence from spoiling any computation .",
    "the problems of error and decoherence are particularly difficult ones for any proposed quantum computer .",
    "while the states of classical computers are typically stored in macroscopic degrees of freedom which have a built - in redundancy and thus are resistant to errors , building similar redundancy into quantum states is less natural . to protect quantum information",
    "it is necessary to encode it using quantum error correcting code states.@xcite these states are highly entangled , and have the property that code states corresponding to different logical qubit states can be distinguished from one another only by global (  topological \" ) measurements . unlike states whose macroscopic degrees of freedom are effectively classical ( think of the magnetic moment of a small part of a hard drive ) , such highly entangled",
    "`` topologically degenerate '' states do not typically emerge as the ground states of physical hamiltonians .",
    "one route to fault - tolerant quantum computation is therefore to build the encoding and fault - tolerant gate protocols into the  software \" of the quantum computer.@xcite    a remarkable recent development in the theory of quantum computation which directly addresses these issues has been the realization that certain exotic states of matter in two space dimensions , so - called nonabelian states , may provide a natural medium for storing and manipulating quantum information.@xcite in these states , localized quasiparticle excitations have quantum numbers which are in some ways similar to ordinary spin quantum numbers .",
    "however , unlike ordinary spins , the quantum information associated with these quantum numbers is stored globally , throughout the entire system , and so is intrinsically protected against decoherence .",
    "furthermore , these quasiparticles satisfy so - called nonabelian statistics .",
    "this means that when two quasiparticles are adiabatically moved around one another , while being kept sufficiently far apart , the action on the hilbert space is represented by a unitary matrix which depends only on the topology of the path used to carry out the exchange .",
    "topological quantum computation can then be carried out by moving quasiparticles around one another in two space dimensions.@xcite the quasiparticle world - lines form topologically nontrivial braids in three (= 2 + 1 ) dimensional space - time , and because these braids are topologically robust ( i.e. , they can not be unbraided without cutting one of the strands ) the resulting computation is protected against error .",
    "nonabelian states are expected to arise in a variety of quantum many - body systems , including spin systems,@xcite rotating bose gases,@xcite and josephson junction arrays.@xcite of those states which have actually been experimentally observed , the most likely to possess nonabelian quasiparticle excitations are certain fractional quantum hall states .",
    "moore and read@xcite were the first to propose that quasiparticle excitations which obey nonabelian statistics might exist in the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "their proposal was based on the observation that the conformal blocks associated with correlation functions in the conformal field theory describing the two - dimensional ising model could be interpreted as quantum hall wave functions .",
    "these wave functions describe both the ground state of a half - filled landau level of spin - polarized electrons , as well as states with some number of fractionally charged quasihole excitations ( charge = @xmath0 ) .",
    "the particular ground state this construction produces , the so - called pfaffian , or moore - read state , is considered the most likely candidate for the observed fractional quantum hall state at landau level filling fraction @xmath1 ( @xmath2 in the second landau level).@xcite    in this conformal field theory construction , states with four or more quasiholes present correspond to finite - dimensional conformal blocks , and so the corresponding wave functions form a finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the monodromy  or braiding properties  of these conformal blocks are then assumed to describe the unitary transformations acting on the hilbert space produced by adiabatically braiding quasiholes around one another.@xcite explicit wave functions for these states were worked out in ref .  , and",
    "the nonabelian braiding properties have been verified numerically in ref .  .",
    "in an alternate approach , the moore - read state can be viewed as a composite fermion superconductor in a so - called  weak pairing \" @xmath3 phase.@xcite in this description , the finite - dimensional hilbert space arises from zero energy solutions of the bogoliubov - degennes equations in the presence of vortices,@xcite and the vortices themselves are nonabelian quasiholes whose braiding properties have been shown to agree with the conformal field theory result.@xcite recently , a number of experiments have been proposed to directly probe the nonabelian nature of these excitations.@xcite    unfortunately , the braiding properties of quasihole excitations in the moore - read state are not sufficiently rich to carry out purely topological quantum computation , although `` partially '' topological quantum computation using a mixture of topological and non - topological gates has been shown to be possible.@xcite however , read and rezayi@xcite have shown that the moore - read state is just one of a sequence of states labeled by an index @xmath4 corresponding to electrons at filling fractions @xmath5 , with @xmath6 corresponding to the @xmath7 laughlin state and @xmath8 to the moore - read state .",
    "the wavefunctions for these states can be written as correlation functions in the @xmath9 parafermion conformal field theory,@xcite and the braiding properties of the quasihole excitations were worked out in detail in ref .  .",
    "there it was shown that the quasiholes are described by the @xmath10 chern - simons - witten ( csw ) theories , up to overall abelian phase factors which are irrelevant for quantum computation .",
    "more recently , explicit quasihole wave functions have been worked out for the @xmath11 read - reazyi state,@xcite with results consistent with the predicted @xmath12 braiding properties .",
    "the elementary braiding matrices for the @xmath10 csw theory for @xmath11 and @xmath13 have been shown to be sufficiently rich to carry out universal quantum computation , in the sense that any desired unitary operation on the hilbert space of @xmath14 quasiparticles , with @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , can be approximated to any desired accuracy by a braid.@xcite    the main purpose of this paper is to give an efficient method for determining braids which can be used to carry out a universal set of a quantum gates ( i.e. single - qubit rotations and controlled - not gates ) on encoded qubits for the case @xmath20 , thought to be physically relevant for the experimentally observed@xcite @xmath21 fractional quantum hall effect@xcite ( @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 in the second landau level , and this is the particle - hole conjugate of @xmath24 corresponding to @xmath20 ) .",
    "we refer to the process of finding such braids as `` topological quantum compiling '' since these braids can then be used to translate a given quantum algorithm into the `` machine code '' of a topological quantum computer .",
    "this is analogous to the action of an ordinary compiler which translates instructions written in a high level programming language into the machine code of a classical computer .",
    "it should be noted that the proof of universality for @xmath12 quasiparticles is a constructive one,@xcite and therefore , as a matter of principle , it provides a prescription for compiling quantum gates into braids .",
    "however , in practice , for two - qubit gates ( such as controlled - not ) this prescription , if followed straightforwardly , is prohibitively difficult to carry out , primarily because it involves searching the space of braids with six or more strands .",
    "we address this difficulty by dividing our two - qubit gate constructions into a series of smaller constructions , each of which only involves searching the space of three - stranded braids ( three - braids ) . the required three - braids then _ can _ be found efficiently and used to construct the desired two - qubit gates .",
    "this  divide and conquer \" approach does not , in general , yield the most accurate braid of a given length which approximates a desired quantum gate .",
    "however , we believe that it does yield the most accurate ( or at least among the most accurate ) braids which can be obtained for a given fixed amount of classical computing power .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the basic properties of the @xmath10 hilbert space , and show that the case @xmath12 is , for our purposes , equivalent to the case @xmath25  the so - called fibonacci anyon model .",
    "section iii then presents a quick review of the mathematical machinery needed to compute with fibonacci anyons . in sec .",
    "iv we outline how , in principle , these particles can be used to encode qubits suitable for quantum computation .",
    "section v then describes how to find braiding patterns for three fibonacci anyons which can be used to carry out any allowed operation on the hilbert space of these quasiparticles to any desired accuracy , thus effectively implementing the procedure given in ref .",
    "for carrying out single - qubit rotations . in sec .",
    "vi we discuss the more difficult case of two - qubit gates , and give two classes of explicit gate constructions  one , first discussed by the authors in ref .  ,",
    "in which a pair of quasiparticles from one qubit is `` woven '' through the quasiparticles in the second qubit , and another , presented here for the first time , in which only a single quasiparticle is woven . finally , in sec .",
    "vii we address the question of to what extent the constructions we find are special to the @xmath20 case , and in sec .",
    "viii we summarize our results .",
    "consider a system with quasiparticle excitations described by the @xmath10 csw theory .",
    "it is convenient to describe the properties of this system using the so - called quantum group language.@xcite the relevant quantum groups are `` deformed '' versions of the representation theory of @xmath26 , i.e. the theory of ordinary spin , and much of the intuition for thinking about ordinary spin can be carried over to the quantum group case .     for ( a ) @xmath8 and ( b ) @xmath20 .",
    "here @xmath14 is the number of @xmath27-spin 1/2 quasiparticles and @xmath28 is the total @xmath27-spin of those quasiparticles .",
    "the number at a given @xmath29 vertex of each diagram indicates the number of paths to that vertex starting from the @xmath30 point .",
    "this number gives the dimensionality of the hilbert space of @xmath14 @xmath27-spin 1/2 quasiparticles with total @xmath27-spin @xmath28 . ]    in the quantum group description of an @xmath10 csw theory , each quasiparticle has a half - integer @xmath27-deformed spin ( @xmath27-spin ) quantum number .",
    "just as for ordinary spin , there are rules for combining @xmath27-spin known as fusion rules .",
    "the fusion rules for the @xmath10 theory are similar to the usual triangle rule for adding ordinary spin , except that they are truncated so that there are no states with total @xmath27-spin @xmath31 .",
    "specifically , the fusion rules for the level @xmath4 theory are,@xcite @xmath32 note that in the quantum group description of nonabelian anyons , states are distinguished only by their total @xmath27-spin quantum numbers .",
    "the @xmath27-deformed analogs of the @xmath33 quantum numbers are physically irrelevant  there is no degeneracy associated with them , and they play no role in any computation involving braiding.@xcite the situation is somewhat analogous to that of a collection of ordinary spin-1/2 particles in which the only allowed operations , including measurement , are rotationally invariant and hence independent of @xmath33 , as is the case in exchange - based quantum computation.@xcite    the fusion rules of the @xmath10 theory fix the structure of the hilbert space of the system . for a collection of quasiparticles with @xmath27-spin 1/2 ,",
    "a useful way to visualize this hilbert space is in terms of its so - called bratteli diagram .",
    "this diagram shows the different fusion paths for @xmath14 @xmath27-spin 1/2 quasiparticles in which these quasiparticles are fused , one at a time , going from left to right in the diagram .",
    "bratteli diagrams for the cases @xmath8 and @xmath20 are shown in fig .",
    "[ bratteli ] .",
    "the dimensionality of the hilbert space for @xmath14 @xmath27-spin 1/2 quasiparticles with total @xmath27-spin @xmath28 can be determined by counting the number of paths in the bratteli diagram from the origin to the point @xmath29 .",
    "the results of this path counting are also shown in fig .",
    "[ bratteli ] , where one can see the well - known @xmath34 hilbert space degeneracy for the @xmath8 ( moore - read ) case,@xcite and the fibonnaci degeneracy for the @xmath20 case.@xcite    in this paper we will focus on the @xmath20 case , which is the lowest @xmath4 value for which @xmath10 nonabelian anyons are universal for quantum computation.@xcite in fact , we will show that two - qubit gates are particularly simple for this case . before proceeding",
    ", it is convenient to introduce an important property of the @xmath12 theory , namely that the braiding properties of @xmath27-spin 1/2 quasiparticles are the same as those with @xmath27-spin 1 ( up to an overall abelian phase which is irrelevant for topological quantum computation ) .",
    "this is a useful observation because the theory of @xmath27-spin 1 quasiparticles in @xmath12 is equivalent to @xmath25 , a theory also known as the fibonacci anyon theory@xcite  a particularly simple theory with only two possible values of @xmath27-spin , 0 and 1 , for which the fusion rules are @xmath35    here we give a rough proof of this equivalence .",
    "this proof is based on the fact that for @xmath20 the fusion rules involving @xmath27-spin 3/2 quasiparticles take the following simple form @xmath36 the key observation is that since for @xmath20 the highest possible @xmath27-spin is 3/2 , when fusing a @xmath27-spin-3/2 object with any other object ( here we use the term object to describe either a single quasiparticle or a group of quasiparticles viewed as a single composite entity ) , the hilbert space dimensionality does not grow .",
    "this implies that moving a @xmath27-spin-3/2 object around other objects can , at most , produce an overall abelian phase factor .",
    "while this phase factor may be important physically , particularly in determining the outcome of interference experiments involving nonabelian quasiparticles,@xcite it is irrelevant for quantum computing , and thus does not matter when determining braids which correspond to a given computation .",
    "because ( [ 3/2fusion ] ) implies that a @xmath27-spin-1/2 object can be viewed as the result of fusing a @xmath27-spin-1 object with a @xmath27-spin-3/2 object , it follows that the braid matrices for @xmath27-spin-1/2 objects are the same as that for @xmath27-spin-1 objects up to an overall phase ( as can be explicitly checked ) .",
    "in fact , based on this argument we can make a stronger statement .",
    "imagine a collection of @xmath12 objects which each have either @xmath27-spin 1 or @xmath27-spin 1/2 .",
    "it is then possible to carry out topological quantum computation , _ even if we do not know which objects have @xmath27-spin 1 and which have @xmath27-spin 1/2_. the proof is illustrated in fig .  [ blob ] .",
    "figure [ blob](a ) shows a braiding pattern for a collection of objects , some of which have @xmath27-spin 1/2 and some of which have @xmath27-spin 1 .",
    "[ blob](b ) then shows the same braiding pattern , but now all objects with @xmath27-spin 1/2 are represented by objects with @xmath27-spin 1 fused to objects with @xmath27-spin 3/2 .",
    "because , as noted above , the @xmath27-spin 3/2 objects have trivial ( abelian ) braiding properties , the unitary transformation produced by this braid is the same , up to an overall abelian phase , as that produced by braiding nothing but @xmath27-spin 1 objects , as shown in fig .",
    "[ blob](c ) .",
    "it follows that provided one can measure whether the total @xmath27-spin of some object belongs to the class @xmath37 or the class @xmath38  something which should , in principle , be possible by performing interference experiments as described in refs .   and ",
    "then quantum computation is possible , even if we do not know which objects have @xmath27-spin 1/2 and which have @xmath27-spin 1 .",
    "having reduced the problem of compiling braids for @xmath12 to compiling braids for @xmath25 , i.e. fibonacci anyons , it is useful for what follows to give more details about the mathematical structure associated with these quasiparticles . for an excellent review of this topic see ref .  , and for the mathematics of nonabelian particles in general see ref .  .",
    "note that for the rest of this paper , except for sec .",
    "vii , it should be understood that each quasiparticle is a @xmath27-spin 1 fibonacci anyon .",
    "it should also be understood that from the point of view of their nonabelian properties quasihole excitations are also @xmath27-spin 1 fibonacci anyons , even though they have opposite electric charge and give opposite abelian phase factors when braided . because it is the nonabelian properties which are relevant for topological quantum computation , for our purposes quasiparticles and quasiholes",
    "can be viewed as identical nonabelian particles . unless it is important to distinguish between the two ( as when we discuss creating and fusing quasiparticles and quasiholes in sec .",
    "iv ) we will simply use the terms quasiparticle or fibonacci anyon to refer to either excitation .",

    "the  oval \" representations of these three states are also shown , which in the text will be represented @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in addition to fusion rules , all theories of nonabelian anyons possess additional mathematical structure which allows one to calculate the result of any braiding operation .",
    "this structure is characterized by the @xmath47 ( fusion ) and @xmath48 ( rotation ) matrices.@xcite    to define the @xmath47 matrix , note that the hilbert space of three fibonacci anyons is spanned both by the three states labeled @xmath49 , and the three states labeled @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath47 matrix is the unitary transformation which maps one of these bases to the other , @xmath51 and has the form f = (    cc|c & & + & - & + & & 1    ) , [ fmatrix]where @xmath52 is the inverse of the golden mean . in this matrix",
    "the upper left 2@xmath532 block , @xmath54 , acts on the two - dimensional total @xmath27-spin 1 sector of the three - quasiparticle hilbert space and the lower right matrix element , @xmath55 , acts on the unique total @xmath27-spin 0 state .",
    "note that this @xmath47 matrix can be applied to any three objects which each have @xmath27-spin 1 , where each object can consist of more than one fibonacci anyon .",
    "furthermore , if one considers three objects for which one or more of the objects has @xmath27-spin 0 , then the state of these objects is uniquely determined by the total @xmath27-spin of all three , and in this case the @xmath47 matrix is trivially the identity .",
    "thus , for the case of fibonacci anyons , the matrix ( [ fmatrix ] ) is all that is needed to make arbitrary basis changes for any number of fibonacci anyons .",
    "the @xmath48 matrix gives the phase factor produced when two fibonacci anyons are moved around one another with a certain sense .",

    "this phase factor depends on the overall @xmath27-spin of the two quasiparticles involved in the exchange , so for fibonacci anyons there are two such phase factors which are summarized in the @xmath48 matrix , @xmath58 here the upper left and lower right matrix elements are , respectively , the phase factor that two fibonacci anyons acquire if they are interchanged in a clockwise sense when they have total @xmath27-spin 0 or @xmath27-spin 1 . again",

    "again we emphasize that in the @xmath20 read - rezayi state , there will be additional abelian phases present , which may have physical consequences for some experiments , but which will be irrelevant for topological quantum computation .",

    ". however , it is impossible to carry out arbitrary single - qubit operations by braiding only the two quasiparticles forming such a qubit  this braiding never changes the total @xmath27-spin of the pair , and so only generates rotations about the @xmath62-axis in the qubit space .    for this reason it is convenient to encode qubits using more than two fibonacci anyons",
    "thus , to create a qubit , _ two _ quasiparticle - quasihole pairs can be pulled out of the vacuum .",
    "the resulting state is then @xmath63 which again has total @xmath27-spin 0 .",
    "the hilbert space of four fibonacci anyons with total @xmath27-spin 0 is two dimensional , with basis states , which we can take as logical qubit states , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , ( see fig  [ qubits](a ) ) .",
    "the state of such a four - quasiparticle qubit is determined by the total @xmath27-spin of either the rightmost or leftmost pair of quasiparticles .",
    "note that the fusion rules ( [ fibfusion ] ) imply that the total @xmath27-spin of these two pairs must be the same because the total @xmath27-spin of all four quasiparticles is 0 .    for this encoding , in addition to the two - dimensional computational qubit space of four quasiparticles with total @xmath27-spin 0",
    ", there is a three - dimensional _ noncomputational _ hilbert space of states with total @xmath27-spin 1 spanned by the states @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "when carrying out topological quantum computation it is crucial to avoid transitions into this noncomputational space .",
    "fortunately , single - qubit rotations can be carried out by braiding quasiparticles within a given qubit and , as discussed in sec .",

    "single - qubit operations can therefore be carried out without any undesirable transitions out of the encoded computational qubit space .",
    "two - qubit gates , however , will require braiding quasiparticles from different qubits around one another .",

    "the main purpose of this paper is to show how such braiding patterns can be efficiently found .",
    "note that the action of braiding the two leftmost quasiparticles in a four - quasiparticle qubit ( referring to fig .",
    "[ qubits](a ) ) is equivalent to that of braiding the two rightmost quasiparticles with the same sense .",
    "this is because as long as we are in the computational qubit space both the leftmost and rightmost quasiparticle pairs must have the same total @xmath27-spin , and so interchanging either pair will result in the same phase factor from the @xmath48 matrix .",
    "it is therefore not necessary to braid all four quasiparticles to carry out single - qubit rotations  one need only braid three .",
    "in fact , one may consider qubits encoded using only three quasiparticles with total @xmath27-spin 1 , as originally proposed in ref .  .",
    "such qubits can be initialized by first creating a four - quasiparticle qubit in the state @xmath59 , as outlined above , and then simply removing one of the quasiparticles . in this three - quasiparticle encoding , shown in fig .",

    "however , just as for four - quasiparticle qubits , when carrying out two - qubit gates these transitions will in general occur and we must work hard to avoid them . henceforth we will refer to these unwanted transitions as leakage errors .",
    "the resulting state corresponds to a four - quasiparticle qubit in the state @xmath59 ( see fig .  [ qubits](a ) ) .",

    "if they fuse back into the vacuum the result of the measurement is @xmath59 , otherwise it is @xmath60 . because only the three lower quasiparticles",

    "note that , because each three - quasiparticle qubit has total @xmath27-spin 1 , when more than one of these qubits is present the state of the system is not entirely characterized by the ",
    "internal \" @xmath27-spin quantum numbers which determine the computational qubit states .",
    "it is also necessary to specify the state of what we will refer to as the  external fusion space \"  the hilbert space associated with fusing the total @xmath27-spin 1 quantum numbers of each qubit .",
    "when compiling braids for three - quasiparticle qubits it is crucial that the operations on the computational qubit space not depend on the state of this external fusion space  if they did , these two spaces would become entangled with one another leading to errors .",
    "fortunately , we will see that it is indeed possible to find braids which do not lead to such errors .    for the rest of this paper ( except sec .",
    "vii ) we will use this three - quasiparticle qubit encoding . it should be noted that any braid which carries out a desired operation on the computational space for three - quasiparticle qubits will carry out the same operation on the computational space of four - quasiparticle qubits , with one quasiparticle in each qubit acting as a spectator .",
    "the braids we find here can therefore be used for either encoding .",

    "we now focus on the problem of finding braids for three fibonacci anyons ( three - braids ) which approximate any allowed unitary transformation on the hilbert space of these quasiparticles .",

[ basis ] , we take the basis states for the three - quasiparticle hilbert space to be the states labeled @xmath49 then , in the @xmath73 basis , the matrix @xmath74 corresponding to a clockwise interchange of the two bottommost quasiparticles in the figure ( or leftmost in the @xmath49 representation ) is _ 1 = (    cc|ce^-i4/5&0 & + 0 & e^i3/5 & + & & e^i3/5    ) , where the upper left 2@xmath532 block acts on the total @xmath27-spin 1 sector ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) of the three quasiparticles , and the lower right matrix element is a phase factor acquired by the @xmath27-spin 0 state ( @xmath61 ) . this matrix",
    "is easily read off from the @xmath48 matrix , since the total @xmath27-spin of the two quasiparticles being exchanged is well defined in this basis .    to find the matrix @xmath72 corresponding to a clockwise interchange of the two topmost ( or rightmost in the @xmath49 representation ) quasiparticles , we must first use the @xmath47 matrix to change bases to one in which the total @xmath27-spin of these quasiparticles is well defined . in this basis ,",
    "the braiding matrix is simply @xmath74 , and so , after changing back to the original basis , we find @xmath77    the unitary transformation corresponding to a given three - braid can now be computed by representing it as a sequence of elementary braid operations and multiplying the corresponding sequence of @xmath74 and @xmath72 matrices and their inverses , as shown in fig .",
    "[ basis ] .",
    "if we are only concerned with single - qubit rotations , then we only care about the action of these matrices on the encoded qubit space with total @xmath27-spin 1 , and not the total @xmath27-spin 0 sector corresponding to the noncomputational state .",
    "however , in our two - qubit gate constructions , various three - braids will be embedded into the braiding patterns of six quasiparticles , and in this case the action on the full three - dimensional hilbert space does matter .    to understand this action note that @xmath74 can be written _ 1 = (    c|c e^-i/10 (    cc e^-i7/10 & 0 + 0 & e^i7/10    ) & + & e^i 3/5    ) ,   where the upper @xmath78 block acting on the total @xmath27-spin 1 sector is an @xmath26 matrix , ( i.e. , a @xmath78 unitary matrix with determinant 1 ) , multiplied by a phase factor of either @xmath79 or @xmath80 , and the lower right matrix element , @xmath81 , is the phase acquired by the total @xmath27-spin 0 state .",
    "the phase factor pulled out of the upper @xmath82 block is only defined up to @xmath83 because any @xmath26 matrix multiplied by @xmath56 is also an @xmath26 matrix .    from ( [ fsf ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath72 can be written in a similar fashion , with the same phase factors .",
    "each clockwise braiding operation then corresponds to applying an @xmath26 operation multiplied by a phase factor of @xmath84 to the @xmath27-spin 1 sector , while at the same time multiplying the @xmath27-spin 0 sector by a phase factor of @xmath85 .",
    "likewise , each counterclockwise braiding operation corresponds to applying an @xmath26 operation multiplied by a phase factor of @xmath86 to the @xmath27-spin 1 sector and a phase factor of @xmath87 to the @xmath27-spin 0 sector .",
    "we define the winding , @xmath88 , of a given three - braid @xmath89 , to be the total number of clockwise interchanges minus the total number of counterclockwise interchanges .",
    "it then follows that the unitary operation corresponding to an arbitrary braid @xmath89 can always be expressed u(b ) = (    c|c e^-i w(b)/10 [ su(2 ) ] & + & e^i3w(b ) /5    ) , [ winding ] where @xmath90 $ ] indicates an @xmath26 matrix .",
    "thus , for a given three - braid , the phase relation between the total @xmath27-spin 1 and total @xmath27-spin 0 sectors of the corresponding unitary operation is determined by the winding of the braid .",
    "we will refer to ( [ winding ] ) often in what follows .",
    "it tells us precisely what unitary operations can be approximated by three - braids , and places useful restrictions on their winding .",
    "at this point it is convenient to restrict ourselves to a subclass of braids which we will refer to as weaves .",
    "a weave is any braid which is topologically equivalent to the space - time paths of some number of quasiparticles in which only a single quasiparticle moves .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that this restricted class of braids is universal for quantum computation , provided the unitary representation of the braid group is dense in the space of all unitary transformations on the relevant hilbert space , which is the case for fibonacci anyons .",
    "following ref .",
    "we will borrow some weaving terminology and refer to the mobile quasiparticle ( or collection of quasiparticles ) as the `` weft '' quasiparticle(s ) and the static quasiparticles as the `` warp '' quasiparticles .",
    "one reason for focusing on weaves is that weaving will likely be easier to accomplish technologically than general braiding .",
    "this is true even if the full computation involves not just weaving a single quasiparticle , as was proposed in ref .  ,",
    "but possibly weaving several quasiparticles at the same time in different regions of the computer  carrying out quantum gates on different qubits in parallel .    considering weaves has the added ( and more immediate ) benefit of simplifying the problem of numerically searching for three - braids which approximate desired gates . for the full braid group , even on just three strands , there is a great deal of redundancy since braids which are topologically equivalent will yield the same unitary operation .",
    "weaves , however , naturally provide a unique representation in which the warp strands are straight , and the weft weaves around them .",
    "there is therefore no trivial `` double counting '' of topologically equivalent weaves when one does a brute force numerical search of weaves up to some given length .",
    "the unitary operations performed by weaving three quasiparticles in which the weft quasiparticle starts and ends in the middle position , will always have the form u_weave(\\{n_i } ) = _ 1^n_m _ 2^n_m-1 _ 1^n_3 _ 2^n_2 _ 1^n_1.[uweave ] here the sequence of exponents @xmath91 all take their values from @xmath92 , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 can take the values @xmath95 . because these exponents are all even , each factor in this sequence takes the weft quasiparticle all the way around one of the two warp quasiparticles either once or twice with either a clockwise or counterclockwise sense , returning it to the middle position .",
    "we allow @xmath93 and @xmath94 to be 0 to account for the possibility that the initial or final weaving operations could each be either @xmath96 or @xmath97 with @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "note that we need only consider exponents @xmath100 up to @xmath99 ( i.e. , moving the weft quasiparticle at most two times around a warp quasiparticle ) because of the fact that @xmath101 for fibonacci anyons , implying , e.g. , @xmath102 .",
    "we define the length @xmath103 of such weaves to be equal to the total number of elementary crossings , thus @xmath104 .",
    "we will also consider weaves in which the weft quasiparticle begins and/or ends at a position other than the middle .",
    "these possibilities can easily be taken into account by multiplying @xmath105 , as defined in ( [ uweave ] ) , by the appropriate factors of @xmath74 or @xmath72 on the right and/or left .",
    "thus , for example , the unitary operation produced by a weave in which the weft quasiparticle starts in the top position and ends in the middle position can be written @xmath106 , where , because of the extra factor of @xmath72 , the first braiding operations carried out by this weave will be @xmath97 where @xmath107 is an odd power , @xmath108 or 5 .",
    "this will weave the weft quasiparticle from the top position to the middle position after which @xmath109 will simply continue weaving this quasiparticle eventually ending with it in the middle position .",
    "( note that by multiplying @xmath109 on the right by @xmath72 , and not @xmath110 , we are not requiring the initial elementary braid to be clockwise , since @xmath109 may have @xmath111 and @xmath112 or @xmath113 so that the initial @xmath72 is immediately multiplied by @xmath72 to a negative power . ) similarly , the unitary operation produced by a weave in which the weft particle starts in the top position and ends in the bottom position can be written @xmath114 , and so on .    to find a weave for which the corresponding unitary operation @xmath115 approximates a particular desired unitary operation , the most straightforward approach is to simply perform a brute force search over all weaves , i.e. all sequences @xmath116 as described above , up to a certain length @xmath103 , in order to find the @xmath115 which is closest to the target operation . here",
    "we will take as a measure of the distance between two operators @xmath117 and @xmath118 the operator norm distance @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the operator norm , defined to be the square root of the highest eigenvalue of @xmath121 .",
    "again , if we are interested in fixing the relative phase of the total @xmath27-spin 1 and total @xmath27-spin 0 sectors then we would restrict the winding of the weaves so that the phases in ( [ winding ] ) match those of the desired target gate .     vs. braid length @xmath103 for weaves approximating the gate @xmath122 .",
    "here @xmath123 is the distance ( defined in terms of operator norm ) between @xmath122 and the unitary transformation produced by a weave of length @xmath103 which best approximates it .",
    "the line is a guide to the eye . ]    for example , imagine our goal is to find a weave which approximates the unitary operation , @xmath124 if the resulting weave were to be used only for a single - qubit operation , then we would only require that the weave approximate the upper left @xmath78 block of @xmath122 up to an overall phase and we would not care about the phase factor appearing in the lower right matrix element",
    ". there would then be no constraint on the winding of the braid .",
    "however , for this example we will assume that this weave will be used in a two - qubit gate construction , for which the overall phase and/or the phase difference between the total @xmath27-spin 1 and total @xmath27-spin 0 sectors will matter .    in this case , by comparing @xmath122 to ( [ winding ] ) , we see that the winding @xmath125 of any weave approximating @xmath122 must satisfy @xmath126 or @xmath127 ( modulo 10 )",
    ". results of a brute force search over weaves satisfying this winding requirement which approximate @xmath128 are shown in fig .",

    "it is expected that , for any such brute force search for weaves approximating a generic target operation , the length should scale with distance according to @xmath130 , because the number of braids grows exponentially with @xmath103 .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ brute ] are consistent with such logarithmic scaling .    all the brute force searches used to find braids in this paper are straightforward sequential searches , meant mainly to demonstrate proof of principle .",
    "no doubt more sophisticated brute force search methods ( e.g. bidirectional search ) could be used to perform deeper searches resulting in longer and more accurate braids .",
    "nevertheless , the exponential growth in the number of braids with @xmath103 implies that finding optimal braids by any brute force search method will rapidly become infeasible as @xmath103 increases .",
    "fortunately one can still systematically improve a given braid to any desired accuracy by applying the solovay - kitaev algorithm,@xcite which we now briefly review .",
    "the general result of the solovay - kitaev theorem tells us that we can efficiently improve the accuracy of any given braid without the need to perform exhaustive brute force searches of ever improving accuracy.@xcite the essential ingredient in this procedure is an @xmath123-net  a discrete set of operators which in the present case correspond to finite braids up to some given length , with the property that for any desired unitary operator there exists an element of the @xmath123-net which is within some given distance @xmath131 of that operator .",
    "provided @xmath131 is sufficiently small , the solovay - kitaev algorithm gives us a clever way to pick a finite number of braid segments out of the @xmath123-net and sew them together so that the resulting gate will be an approximation to the desired gate with improved accuracy .",
    "the implementation of the solovay - kitaev algorithm we use here follows closely that described in detail in refs .   and .",
    "the first step of this algorithm is to find a braid which approximates the desired gate , @xmath117 , by performing a brute force search over the @xmath123-net .",
    "let @xmath132 denote the result of this search .",
    "since we know that @xmath133 it follows that @xmath134 is an operator which is within a distance @xmath131 of the identity .",
    "the next step is to decompose @xmath135 as a group commutator .",
    "this means that we find two unitary operators @xmath136 and @xmath89 for which @xmath137 . the unitary operators @xmath136 and @xmath89 are chosen so that their action on the computational qubit space corresponds to small rotations through the same angle but about perpendicular axes . for this choice ,",
    "if @xmath136 and @xmath89 are then approximated by operators @xmath138 and @xmath139 in the @xmath123-net , it can readily be shown that the operator @xmath140 , will approximate @xmath135 to a distance of order @xmath141 .",
    "it follows that the operator @xmath142 is an approximation to @xmath117 within a distance @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is a constant which determines the size of the @xmath123-net needed to guarantee an improvement in accuracy .    .",
    "the braid @xmath132 is the result of a brute force search over weaves up to length 44 which best approximates the desired gate @xmath145 , with an operator norm distance between @xmath117 and @xmath132 of @xmath146 .",
    "the braids @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the results of similar brute force searches to approximate unitary operations @xmath136 and @xmath89 whose group commutator satisfies @xmath147 = @xmath148 . the new braid @xmath149 is then five times longer than @xmath132 , and the accuracy has improved so that the distance to the target gate is now @xmath150 . given the group commutator structure of the @xmath151 factor , the winding of the @xmath152 braid is the same as the @xmath132 braid .",
    "note that when joining braids to form @xmath152 it is possible that elementary braid operations from one braid will multiply their own inverses in another braid , allowing the total braid to be shortened .",
    "here we have left these  redundant \" braids in @xmath152 , as the careful reader should be able to find . ]",
    "what we have just described corresponds to one iteration of the solovay - kitaev algorithm .",
    "subsequent iterations are carried out recursively .",
    "thus , at the second level of approximation each search within the @xmath123-net is replaced by the procedure described above , and so on , so that at the @xmath153 level all approximations are made at the @xmath154 level .",
    "the result of this recursive process is a braid whose accuracy grows superexponentially in @xmath107 , with the distance to the desired gate being of order @xmath155 at the @xmath153 level of recursion , while the braid length grows only exponentially in @xmath107 , with @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is a typical braid length in the initial @xmath123-net .",
    "thus , as the distance of the approximate gate from the desired target gate , @xmath123 , goes to zero , the braid length grows only polylogarithmically , with @xmath158 where @xmath159 . while this scaling is , of course , worse than the logarithmic scaling for brute force searching , it is still only a polylogarithmic increase in braid length which is sufficient for quantum computation .",
    "similar arguments@xcite can be used to show that the classical computer time @xmath160 required to carry out the solovay - kitaev algorithm also only scales polylogarithmically in the desired accuracy , with @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "it is worth noting that there is a particularly nice feature of this implementation of the solovay - kitaev algorithm when applied to compiling three - braids . recall that when carrying out two - qubit gates it will be crucial to maintain the phase difference between the total @xmath27-spin 1 and total @xmath27-spin 0 sectors of the three - quasiparticle hilbert space associated with a given three - braid , and , according to ( [ winding ] ) , this can be done by fixing the winding of the braid ( modulo 10 ) . because of the group commutator structure of the solovay - kitaev algorithm , the winding of the @xmath153-level approximation @xmath163 will be the same as that of the initial approximation @xmath132 .",

    "it is therefore sufficient to consider the special case when the state of two three - quasiparticle qubits corresponds to that of the two four - quasiparticle qubits shown in fig .",
    "[ proof ] , but with the topmost and bottommost quasiparticles removed .",
    "the above arguments then imply any leakage free operation produced by braiding the four middle quasiparticles must be diagonal in @xmath191 and @xmath202 .",
    "now consider the four middle quasiparticles we are allowed to braid . a basis for the hilbert space of these quasiparticles can be taken to be one labeled by the @xmath27-spin quantum numbers @xmath191 and @xmath202 , as well as the total @xmath27-spin of all four quasiparticles which we denote @xmath227 ( see fig .",
    "[ proof ] ) . for @xmath232",
    "the fusion rules ( [ fusion ] ) imply this total @xmath27-spin @xmath227 can be equal to 0 , 1 or 2 , while for @xmath20 it can only be equal to 0 or 1 .",
    "we will see that this truncation of the @xmath230 state is the crucial property of the @xmath20 theory which makes our @xmath47 weave and effective braiding constructions possible .",
    "it is convenient at this stage to restrict ourselves to braids with zero total winding ( i.e. equal numbers of clockwise and counterclockwise exchanges ) . for such braids , arguments similar to those used to derive ( [ winding ] )",
    "can be used to show the unitary operation enacted on the @xmath233 and 2 sectors must each have determinant 1 .",
    "there is no loss of generality in restricting ourselves to such braids , since a braid with arbitrary winding can always be turned into one with zero winding by adding the appropriate number of interchanges to either the two topmost or two bottommost of the braiding quasiparticles at either the beginning or end of the braid .",
    "these added interchanges will all be within encoded qubits and so correspond to single - qubit rotations which will not produce any entanglement between the two qubits .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to braids with zero winding and insist that these braids approximate gates with zero leakage error  which , as shown above , implies the gate must be diagonal in the @xmath191 and @xmath202 quantum numbers  then in the @xmath234 basis the unitary transformation acting on the hilbert space of the four braiding quasiparticles must have the form @xmath235 where we have required that the @xmath236 , 1 and 2 blocks all have determinant 1 , ( in particular , the @xmath230 block is simply 1 ) .",
    "note that the case @xmath228 has three entries in this matrix , corresponding to the three possible values for the total @xmath27-spin quantum number @xmath227 . for this gate to produce no leakage error",
    ", the phase factors in all three of these sectors must be the same . to see this note that one can expand the relevant eight - quasiparticle state in terms of basis states with well - defined values of @xmath227 as follows @xmath237 where standard quantum group methods@xcite can be used to compute the coefficients @xmath238 , with the result @xmath239_q},\\ \\",
    "f_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{[3]_q}}{[3]_q},\\ \\ f_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{[5]_q}}{[3]_q}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have introduced the @xmath27-integers @xmath240_q \\equiv ( q^{m/2 } -q^{-m/2})/(q^{1/2}-q^{-1/2})$ ] , where @xmath241 is the deformation parameter .    for @xmath231",
    "all three @xmath238 coefficients are nonzero .",
    "thus , in order for the action of ( [ kgt3 ] ) on the @xmath228 state to produce the same state back ( up to a phase ) , the projection of this state in the three @xmath227 sectors must all acquire the same phase .",
    "this implies that @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "the resulting unitary operation must therefore take the form @xmath244 which corresponds to the following two - qubit gate in the @xmath245 basis , @xmath246 this gate is simply the tensor product of two single - qubit rotations , @xmath247 .",
    "thus we see that for @xmath232 any two - qubit gate constructed by braiding only four quasiparticles for which there is no leakage error must necessarily also produce no entanglement .",
    "for @xmath20 this argument breaks down because the @xmath230 sector of the braiding quasiparticles is not present . in this case , following the same argument as above , in the @xmath248 basis the allowed leakage free unitary transformations which can be produced by braiding the four middle quasiparticles must be of the form ( again taking the case of zero winding ) , @xmath249 which corresponds to the following two - qubit gate in the @xmath250 basis , @xmath251 as for @xmath252 , the @xmath253 dependence of @xmath254 corresponds to a tensor product of single - qubit rotations .",
    "gates of this form with fixed @xmath255 but different values of @xmath253 are thus equivalent up to single - qubit rotations .",
    "if we use this equivalence to set @xmath256 we see that gates of the form @xmath254 are equivalent to the gates produced by our @xmath47 weave construction ( [ fgate ] ) , and so , in particular , when @xmath213 the resulting gate is equivalent to a controlled - not gate .",
    "to summarize , we have shown how to construct both single - qubit and two - qubit gates for qubits encoded using nonabelian quasiparticles described by @xmath12 csw theory , or , equivalently , the @xmath25 theory ( fibonacci anyons ) .",
    "qubits are encoded into triplets of quasiparticles and single - qubit gates are carried out by braiding quasiparticles within qubits .",
    "two classes of two - qubit gate constructions were presented . in the first",
    ", a pair of quasiparticles from one qubit is woven through those forming the second qubit . in the second",
    ", a single quasiparticle is woven through three static quasiparticles ( one from the same qubit as the mobile quasiparticle , the other two from the second qubit ) .",
    "a central theme in all of our two - qubit gate constructions is that of breaking the problem of compiling braids for the six quasiparticles used to encode two qubits into a series of braids involving only three objects at a time . while these constructions do not in general produce the optimal braid of a given length which approximates a desired two - qubit gate , we believe they do lead to the most accurate ( or at least among the most accurate ) two - qubit gates which can be obtained for a fixed amount of classical computing power . finally , we proved a theorem which states that for the @xmath10 csw theory , two - qubit gates constructed by braiding only four quasiparticles ( two from each qubit ) can only lead to leakage free entangling two - qubit gates when @xmath20 .",
