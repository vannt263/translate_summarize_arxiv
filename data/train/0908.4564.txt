    "_ lisa _ pathfinder ( _ lpf _ ) is a science and technology demonstrator programmed by the european space agency ( _ esa _ ) within its _ lisa _ mission activities  @xcite .",
    "_ lisa _ ( laser interferometer space antenna ) is a joint _ esa - nasa _ mission which will be the first low frequency ( milli - hz ) gravitational wave detector , and also the first space - borne gravitational wave observatory .",
    "_ lpf _ s payload is the _ lisa _ technology package ( ltp ) , and will be the highest sensitivity geodesic explorer flown to date .",
    "the ltp is designed to measure relative accelerations between two test masses ( tm ) in nominal free fall ( geodesic motion ) with a noise budget of @xmath0   \\frac{\\rm{m\\ ; s}^{-2}}{\\sqrt{\\rm hz } } \\label{eq.0}\\ ] ] in the frequency band between 1 mhz and 30 mhz  @xcite .",
    "noise in the _ ltp _ arises as a consequence of various disturbances , mainly generated within the spacecraft itself , which limit the performance of the instrument .",
    "a number of these disturbances are monitored and dealt with by means of suitable devices , which form the so - called _ diagnostics subsystem _  @xcite . in _ lpf _ , this includes thermal and magnetic diagnostics , plus the radiation monitor , which provides counting and spectral information on ionizing particles hitting the spacecraft",
    ". the magnetic diagnostics system will be the subject of our attention here .",
    "one of the most important functions of the ltp magnetic diagnostics is the determination of the magnetic field and its gradient at the positions of the tms . for this , it includes a set of four tri - axial fluxgate magnetometers , intended to measure with high precision the magnetic field at the positions they occupy in the spacecraft  see figure  [ fig.1 ] .",
    "their readouts do not however provide a direct measurement of the magnetic field at the positions where the tms are , and an interpolation method must therefore be implemented to calculate it . in the circumstances we face ,",
    "this is a difficult problem , mostly because the magnetometers layout is such that they are too distant from the locations of the tms compared with the typical scales of the distribution of magnetic sources in the satellite .",
    "its solution is however imperative since magnetic noise can be as high as 40% of the total budget  @xcite given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.0 ] ) , and hence it must be properly quantified .    ]    in order to design a suitable interpolation scheme , information on the actual distribution of magnetic sources is necessary .",
    "data from the spacecraft manufacturer ( eads astrium stevenage , uk ) have kindly been handed to us  @xcite for this purpose . according to these data ,",
    "magnetic sources can be characterized as magnetic dipoles , whose positions are known and whose magnetic moments are only known in modulus  not in orientation .",
    "most of these dipoles are associated to electronic boxes , with a few genuinely magnetic elements .",
    "an exception to this rule is the solar panels , which cover the entire spacecraft and can hardly be considered as a dipole as seen by the magnetometers .",
    "they are however designed so that their cells are arranged to minimize magnetic effects by having their rim wires wound contiguous and in opposite senses .",
    "astrium data are based on system design , so validation with the real spacecraft must be done by means of experiment , which is of course included in the planned activities before launch .",
    "actually , though , the structure of the magnetic source distribution and their properties will not be directly visible either to the magnetometers or to the interpolation algorithms , which will just work with magnetic field values no matter how they are generated .",
    "nevertheless , we think that the information available so far , though not final , qualifies very well as a guide to the elaboration of a magnetic model which will be needed to define and verify the performance of the analysis algorithms which will eventually be applied to the data delivered by the satellite in flight .    in this paper we will make use of the dipole model of the sources to assess the performance of two different types of interpolation methods : multipole interpolation and neural network algorithms .",
    "the first is the more immediate one to try , but as we will show below it is not as efficient as one might expect _ a priori_. to overcome this problem we propose a novel method , based on neural networks .",
    "based on the results obtained with the same dipole source model , our solution looks promising since the errors of the interpolated fields and gradients are significantly smaller than those obtained with the multipole approach .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "[ chap.2 ] we provide a general description of the problem .",
    "it follows sect .",
    "[ chap.3 ] , where we discuss the multipole interpolation , whereas in sect .",
    "[ chap.4 ] we explain our neural network approach .",

    "[ chap.5 ] , while in sect .",
    "[ chap.6 ] we summarize our major findings and we draw our conclusions .",
    "magnetic noise in the _ ltp _ is allowed to be a significant fraction of the total mission acceleration noise : @xmath1ms@xmath2hz@xmath3 can be apportioned to magnetism , i.e. , 40% of the total noise , 3@xmath410@xmath5ms@xmath2hz@xmath3 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq.0 ] ) .",
    "this noise occurs because the residual magnetization and susceptibility of the tms couple to the surrounding magnetic field , giving rise to a force @xmath6{\\bf b}\\right\\rangle v   \\label{eq.1}\\ ] ] in each of the tms . in this expression * b * is the magnetic field in the tm ,  @xmath7 and * m * are its magnetic susceptibility and density of magnetic moment ( magnetization ) , respectively , and @xmath8 is the volume of the tm ; @xmath9 is the vacuum magnetic constant , @xmath10mkgs@xmath2a@xmath2 ) , and @xmath11 indicates tm volume average of the enclosed quantity .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field and its gradient randomly fluctuate in the regions occupied by the test masses , thus resulting in a randomly fluctuating force : @xmath12{\\bf b}+   \\frac{\\chi}{\\mu_0}\\,\\left[\\delta{\\bf b}{{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\cdot}\\/$}}}{{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\nabla}\\/$}}}\\right]{\\bf b }   \\right\\rangle v   \\label{eq.2}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 represents the fluctuation of the magnetic field , and @xmath14 stands for the fluctuation of the gradient  @xcite",
    ".    quantitative assessment of magnetic noise in the _ ltp _ clearly requires real - time monitoring of the magnetic field , which in _ lpf _ is done by means of a set of four tri - axial fluxgate magnetometers  @xcite .",
    "these devices have a high - permeability magnetic core , which drives a design constraint to keep them somewhat far from the tms .",
    "the price to be paid for this is that the measured field is not directly useful ( we need to know it at the positions of the tms ) .",
    "hence , a procedure to estimate it at these positions , based on the data delivered by the magnetometers , must be set up .",
    "as previously mentioned , the sources of magnetic field are essentially electronics boxes plus a few genuinely magnetic components inside the spacecraft .",
    "the interplanetary magnetic field is orders of magnitude weaker , hence of little relevance to the effects considered here , and solar panel effects will not be considered  see section  [ chap.1 ] .",
    "there are no sources of magnetic field inside the _ ltp _ core assembly ( _ lca _ ) , all being placed outside its walls .",
    "the number of astrium identified sources is around 40 , and can be modeled as point magnetic dipoles  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig.2 ] gives an overview of the geometry , see caption for details .    ]",
    "perhaps the most immediate ( and obvious ) procedure to interpolate the magnetic field is to resort to its multipole structure .",
    "this is known to be the best option in some mathematical sense  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we first describe the details of its implementation , and then we assess its practical merit .",
    "we will treat the _",
    "lca _ region as a vacuum .",
    "this is a reasonable hypothesis , as the materials inside it are essentially non - magnetic .",
    "accordingly , the magnetic field has zero divergence and rotational : @xmath15 since @xmath16 , we thus have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a scalar function .",
    "additionally , since @xmath19=0 , too , it immediately follows that @xmath18 is a harmonic function , or @xmath20    the solution to this equation can be expressed as an orthogonal series of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the spherical coordinates of the field point * x * , whose origin is by ( arbitrary ) convention assumed in the geometric center of the _ lca_. equation  ( [ eq.7 ] ) could also contain terms proportional to @xmath23 , but these have been dropped because the field can not diverge at the center of the _ lca_. actually , the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq.7 ] ) is only valid in a region interior to the closest field source . finally , the coefficients @xmath24 , which will be called multipole coefficients in the sequel , depend on the sources of magnetic field .    to obtain the field components we take the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq.7 ] ) following eq .",
    "( [ eq.5 ] ) : @xmath25   \\label{eq.9}\\ ] ]    according to standard mathematics , the coefficients @xmath24 can be fully determined if the magnetic field is known at the boundary of the volume where the field equations are considered , in this case the _ lca_.",
    "this data is of course not available to us , since we only know * b * in four points of the boundary , where the magnetometers are .",
    "therefore the question we need to address is : how many terms of the series can we possibly determine on the basis of the limited information available ? or , equivalently , how many multipole coefficients can we estimate , given the magnetometers readout data ?",
    "then , also , to which accuracy can we estimate the actual magnetic field after the maximum number of multipole coefficients have been calculated ?",
    "the answer to the first question above is actually not difficult : let us assume that the series in eq .",
    "( [ eq.9 ] ) is truncated after a maximum multipole index value @xmath26=@xmath27 . the estimated field , @xmath28 ,",
    "is then given by : @xmath29   \\label{eq.10}\\ ] ] the number of terms in this sum is @xmath30 which obviously equals the number of multipole coefficients needed to evaluate the sum .",
    "for example , we have @xmath31=8 and @xmath32=15 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of magnetometer data channels is 12  three channels per magnetometer , as the devices are tri - axial .",
    "this means we can not push the series beyond the quadrupole ( @xmath26=2 ) terms .",
    "this means that since we only have 12 data channels we have some redundancy to determine the first eight @xmath24 coefficients up to @xmath26=2 , though we also lack information to evaluate the next seven octupole terms .",
    "are actually complex numbers , which may mislead one into inferring that actually fewer can be calculated .",
    "this is however not so because of the symmetry @xmath24=@xmath33 , which ensures that @xmath34 is actually a real number . ]    in order to make a best estimate of the @xmath24 , a least - square method is set up as follows .",
    "firstly , we define a quadratic error : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the real magnetic field and the sum extends over the number of magnetometers , situated at positions @xmath37 ( @xmath38=1,  ,4 ) .",
    "we then find those values of @xmath39 which minimize the error : @xmath40    once this system of equations is solved , the estimated coefficients @xmath24 are replaced back into eq .",
    "( [ eq.10 ] ) and then the spatial arguments * x * substituted by the positions of each test mass to finally obtain the interpolated field values . this process needs to be repeated for each instant @xmath41 of time at which measurements are taken , thereby generating the magnetic field time series .",
    "the gradient is estimated by taking the derivatives of eq .",
    "( [ eq.10 ] ) : @xmath42   \\label{eq.14}\\ ] ]    it is to be noted that eq .",
    "( [ eq.10 ] ) is a polynomial of degree @xmath43@xmath441 in the space coordinates @xmath45 , hence its degree equals 1 when @xmath27=2 . since this is the most we can get of the magnetometer readout channels , the multipole expansion is actually equivalent to a _ linear _ interpolation of the field between its values at the boundary of the _ lca _ and its interior .",
    "we may therefore not expect this method to produce excellent results , simply because the magnetic field inside the _ lca _ is weaker than at its boundaries , the reason being that the magnetic field sources are outside the _",
    "lca_. this valley structure of the magnetic field needs at least octupole ( quadratic ) terms to be approximated , but this would require at least one more vector magnetometer , which is not available . by the same argument , the field gradient can only be approximated by a _",
    "constant _ value throughout the _ lca _  see eq .",
    "( [ eq.14 ] ) .      in order to have a quantitative idea of the actual performance of the above interpolation scheme , we make use of the source dipole model .",
    "it has the following ingredients and assumptions :    1 .",
    "the sources of magnetic are point dipoles outside the _ lca_. 2 .",
    "the sources are those identified by astrium stevenage , as already mentioned , whose positions in the s / c are known .",
    "the set itself , as well as the source magnetic parameters need to be updated , but the data used ( which date back to november 2006 ) qualifies to verify the performance of the interpolation methods . 3 .   the magnetic field created by the dipole distribution at a generic point * x * and time @xmath41 is therefore given by @xmath46\\,{\\bf n}_a -           { \\bf m}_a(t)}{\\left|{\\bf x}-{\\bf x}_a\\right|^3 }         \\label{eq.15}\\ ] ] where * n*@xmath47= @xmath48/@xmath49 are unit vectors connecting the the @xmath50-th dipole * m*@xmath47 with the field point * x * , and @xmath51 is the number of dipoles .",
    "fluctuations of the dipoles , both in modulus and direction , are unknown , but this is not essential to assess the numerical performance of the algorithm .",
    "we aim to compare interpolated magnetic field results with exact ones within the context and scope of the above model . to artificially simulate several possible scenarios",
    ", we will take advantage of the uncertainties in the source dipole orientations to randomly generate different magnetic field patterns , which we intend to reconstruct based on the multipole expansion . more specifically",
    ", the procedure is the following one :    1 .",
    "each dipole has a known fixed position in the spacecraft , and a fixed modulus , also known .",
    "the number of magnetic dipoles is also fixed to 37 , which is the number in astrium s list .",
    "the orientations of the dipoles are instead unknown .",
    "an example scenario is characterized by a specific selection of the 37 dipole orientations .",
    "3 .   in order to explore the behavior of the algorithm ,",
    "a batch of examples are examined , each corresponding to a randomly generated set of dipole orientations .",
    "4 .   in each case , eq .  ( [ eq.13 ] ) is solved for @xmath39 , and the field estimate at each tm is then calculated with eq .",
    "( [ eq.10 ] ) . in the last step , the result",
    "is compared with the theoretical one given in eq .",
    "( [ eq.15 ] ) , and the differences annotated .",
    "5 .   finally , a statistical analysis of the differences ( errors ) is done .",
    "the random character of the procedure may seem unrealistic , since the actual satellite configuration is not random . in this context",
    ", however , randomness is an efficient way of mimicking lack of knowledge .",
    "as we will see in the next section , numerical analysis based on this methodology sheds much light on the merits of the interpolation procedure  as it will also be the case when we come to neural networks performance in section  [ chap.5 ] .",

    "is that for the case of the @xmath63-component of the magnetic field both methods yield distributions which are almost symmetrical .",

    "this a very encouraging outcome which points to the use of the neural networks as the baseline tool to analyse _ ltp _ magnetic data .",
    "one of the main problems of using the neural network to assess the magnetic field at the positions of the test masses is to find a training process adequate to the set of data that the magnetometers will deliver in flight .",

    "a different issue , which is beyond the scope of this paper and it is currently under investigation , is how to deal with time series of magnetometer readouts , which is of course the kind of data the satellite will transmit to ground .",
    "features such as trends , field fluctuations,  will likely happen during mission operations , and the neural network algorithm must be trained to properly deal with them .",
