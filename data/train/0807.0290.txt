    "although it has been generally accepted that the prompt gamma - ray emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) results from internal dissipation , likely internal shocks , of a relativistic outflow ( e.g. paczyski & xu 1994 ; rees & 1994 ) , the dissipation site and the radiation mechanism for the gamma - ray emission are still largely unknown .",
    "synchrotron and/or inverse - compton scattering emission by shock - accelerated electrons in the optically - thin region has been proposed as an efficient mechanism for the gamma - ray emission . however , this model does not satisfactorily account for a few observational facts , such as the low - energy spectral slops that are steeper than synchrotron lower energy spectral indices ( preece et al .",
    "2000 ; lloyd et al . 2000 ) , the clustering of peak energies , the correlation between the burst s peak energy and luminosity ( amati et al .",
    "it becomes recognized that an additional thermal component may play a key role and could solve these problems ( e.g. peer et al .",
    "2006 ; ryde et al .",
    "it has also been pointed out that a hybrid model with both a thermal and non - thermal component can describe the spectrum equally well as the band function model ( band 1993 ) , but the former has a more physical meaning ( ryde 2005 ) .",
    "recently , it was suggested that a strong quasi - thermal component could result from the internal dissipation occurring in the optically thick inner parts of relativistic outflows ( rees & 2005 ; peer , & rees 2006 ; thompson et al .",
    "sub - photospheric shock dissipation can increase the radiative efficiency of the outflow , significantly boosting the original thermal photospheric component so that it may well dominate the nonthermal component from optically - thin shocks occurring outside the photosphere .",
    "neutrino emission from gamma - ray bursts has been predicted at different stages of the relativistic outflow , such as the precursor phase ( e.g. bahcall & 2000 ; & waxman 2001 ; razzaque et al .",

    "the neutrino emission from proton - proton ( @xmath3 ) collisions was generally thought to be negligible due to lower collision opacity for optically - thin internal shocks .",
    "however , as we show below , if some part of the prompt emission arises from internal shocks occurring in the optically - thick inner part of the outflow , as indicated by the thermal emission , a lower energy ( @xmath4 ) neutrino component may appear as a result of @xmath3 collisions .",
    "the photosphere models have been widely discussed in relation to the prompt emission of grbs ( e.g. thompson 1994 ; ghisellini & celotti 1999 ; rees & 2005 ; thompson et al . 2007 ;",

    "the potential advantage of photosphere models is that the peak energy can be stabilized , which is identified as the thermal or comptonization thermal peak ( see ioka et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "the photosphere radiation may also produce a large number of electron - positron pairs , which may lead to a pair photosphere beyond the baryon - related photosphere ( e.g. rees & 2005 ) , and may also enhance the radiative efficiency ( ioka et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is also suggested that the number of pairs produced does not exceed the baryon related electrons by a factor larger than a few ( peer et al .",
    "2006 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we here only consider the dissipation below the baryon - related photosphere , which is more favorable for @xmath3 neutrino production .",
    "following rees & ( 2005 ) and peer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we assume that during the early stage of the prompt emission , internal shocks of the outflow occur at radii below the baryonic photosphere . initially , the internal energy is released at the base of the outflow , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the schwarzschild radius of a central object of mass @xmath8 .",
    "the internal energy is then converted to the kinetic energy of the flow , whose bulk lorentz factor grows as @xmath9 up to a saturation radius at @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the initial dimensionless entropy , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the total energy and mass outflow rates . above the saturation radius ,",
    "the observer - frame photospherical luminosity decreases as @xmath14 and the greater part of energy is in kinetic form , @xmath15 . if the dissipation is maintained all the way to the photosphere , it will lead to an effective luminosity @xmath16 and a temperature ( rees & 2005 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dissipation efficiency , @xmath19 is the initial temperature of the fireball outflow and @xmath20 is the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow .",
    "the internal shock occurs at @xmath21 , for which the optical depth to thomson scattering by the baryon - related electrons is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the thomson scattering cross section and @xmath24 is the kinetic energy luminosity .",
    "the photosphere is further out , at radius @xmath25 .",
    "a detailed calculation taking into account of the electron / positron cooling and the comptonization effect leads to a quasi - thermal emission which peaks at energy @xmath26 for dissipation at thomson optical depth of @xmath27 ( peer et al .",
    "this temperature is consistent with the observed peak energies of prompt gamma - ray emission of a majority of grbs .    assuming that a fraction of @xmath28 of the shock internal energy is converted into magnetic fields",
    ", we have a magnetic field @xmath29 . protons accelerated by internal shocks",
    "are assumed to have a spectrum @xmath30 with @xmath31 , as often assumed for non - relativistic or mildly - relativistic shock acceleration .",
    "the maximum proton energy is set by comparing the acceleration time scale @xmath32 with the energy - loss time scales .",
    "the synchrotron loss time is @xmath33 .",
    "assuming that the sub - photosphere emission at the dissipation site peaks at @xmath34 with a thermal - like spectrum , the number density of photons in the comoving frame is @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 cooling time is approximately @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the inelasticity and @xmath39 is the peak cross section at the @xmath40 resonance . by comparison with the synchrotron loss time",
    ", it is found that the most effective cooling mechanism for protons is the @xmath36 process for protons with energies above the @xmath36 threshold , but below @xmath41 .",
    "equating @xmath42 , we obtain the maximum proton energy in the shock comoving frame @xmath43",
    "the shock - accelerated protons produce mesons via @xmath3 and @xmath36 interactions .",
    "since the meson multiplicity in @xmath3 interactions is about 1 for pions while 0.1 for kaons , neutrinos contributed by pion decay are dominant when the cooling effect of pions is not important , which is applicable to the low energy pp neutrinos .",
    "therefore we here consider only pion production in @xmath3 interactions .",
    "the pion production by @xmath3 interaction in the sub - photosphere dissipation is efficient since the cooling time in the shock comoving frame , @xmath44 can be shorter than the shock dynamic time , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the cross section for @xmath3 interactions , @xmath47 is the proton number density , and @xmath48 is the inelasticity .",
    "protons also cool through bethe - heitler interactions ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath36 interactions when the target photon energy seen by the protons is above the threshold energy for each interaction . denoting by @xmath50 the number density of photons in the energy range @xmath51 to @xmath52 , the cooling time in the shock comoving frame for @xmath36 and bethe - heitler cooling processes are given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are respectively the cross section and the inelasticity for @xmath36 ( or bethe - heitler ) process . as a rough estimate ,",
    "the bethe - heitler cooling time is @xmath57 when @xmath58 is a large value ( a good approximation when @xmath59 , chodorowski et al . 1992 ) , where @xmath60 is the thermal peak energy of photons in the comoving frame .",
    "so when the proton energy is larger than @xmath61 , the bethe - heitler cooling dominates over the @xmath3 cooling . at even higher energies near the threshold for @xmath36 interactions at @xmath62 , @xmath36 cooling becomes increasingly dominant .",
    "we compare these three cooling time scales for protons in fig.1 for representative parameters , using more accurate cross sections for @xmath36 and bethe - heitler processes in eq.(4 ) . for photopion production cross section , we take the lorentzian form for the resonance peak ( mcke et al .",
    "2000 ) plus a component contributed by multi - pion production at higher energies , while for bethe - heitler process we use the cross section given by chodorowski et al .",
    "the number density of photons used in the calculation has been assumed to have a blackbody distribution .",
    "the numerical result confirms that that @xmath3 cooling and @xmath36 cooling are dominant , respectively , at lowest and highest energies , while at the intermediate energies , the bethe - heitler cooling is the dominant one .",
    "defining the total cooling time for protons as @xmath63 , the total energy loss fraction of protons is @xmath64 .",
    "the fractions of energy loss by @xmath3 and @xmath36 processes are respectively , @xmath65    the cooling of secondary pions may also affect the neutrino production efficiency if they suffer from cooling before decaying to secondary products .",
    "the pions suffer from radiative cooling due to both synchrotron emission and inverse - compton emission .",
    "the total radiative cooling time is @xmath66\\simeq0.002 ( { \\epsilon'_{\\pi}}/{1 { \\rm tev}})^{-1 } \\epsilon_{b,-1}^{-1}l_{k,52}^{-1 } r_{11}^2 \\gamma_2 ^ 2 \\,{\\rm s}$ ] , where @xmath67 is the energy density of the magnetic filed in the shock region and @xmath68 is the correction factor accounting for the inverse - compton loss .",
    "the pions also cool due to collisions with protons ( ando & beacom 2005 ) .",
    "the cooling for this hadronic process is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the cross section for meson - proton collisions and @xmath71 is the energy lost by the meson per collision .",
    "the suppression of neutrino emission due to cooling of pions can be obtained by comparing the cooling time @xmath72 or @xmath73 with the lifetime of pions @xmath74 in the shock comoving frame , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the pion lorentz factor and proper lifetime .",
    "this defines two critical energies for pions , above which the effect of radiative cooling or hadronic cooling starts to suppress the neutrino flux , i.e. @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the total cooling time of pions is @xmath79 and the total suppression factor on the neutrino flux due to pion cooling is ( razzaque et al .",
    "2004 ) @xmath80",
    "the total energy emitted in neutrinos from @xmath3 or @xmath36 processes per grb is , respectively , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the energy in accelerated protons in one burst during the dissipative photosphere phase , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the maximum and minimum energies of acceleration protons . in the absence of pion cooling loss ,",
    "the neutrinos produced by pion decay carry @xmath85 of the energy lost by protons to pion production , since charged and neutral pions are produced with roughly equal probability and muon neutrinos carry roughly @xmath86 of the pion energy in pion decay .",
    "neutrino flux within a factor of 2 ( the factor , however , could be larger for @xmath36 neutrino flux ) . ]",
    "the mean pion energy is about @xmath87 of the energy of the proton producing the pion , so the mean energy of neutrinos is @xmath88 . assuming that protons are efficiently accelerated in shocks with an energy density of @xmath89 , the number of tev neutrinos from one grb is about @xmath90 for @xmath91 , according to eq.(8 ) .",
    "so only from very strong bursts with gamma - ray fluence @xmath92 , which are very rare events , can neutrinos from single grb be detected .",
    "the aggregated muon neutrino flux from all grbs is approximately given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the correction factor for the contribution from high redshift sources and @xmath95 is the overall grb rate at redshift @xmath96 . assuming that grb rate traces the star - formation rate in the universe , the calculation gives @xmath97 ( waxman & bahcall 1999 ) .",
    "it is not clear how efficiently the protons are accelerated in grb shocks .",
    "assuming an optimistic case that protons are efficiently accelerated in shocks and that half of the kinetic energy dissipation occurs below the photosphere , we take a mean value @xmath98 for the isotropic equivalent energy in accelerated protons in one grb during the dissipative photosphere phase , based on a typically used value @xmath99 for the isotropic kinetic energy luminosity and a typical long grb duration of @xmath100 s. the grb rate ( e.g. guetta & piran 2007 ; le & dermer 2007 ) , while others get a higher rate comparable to earlier estimate before _ swift _",

    "if the kinetic energy is dissipated at radius of @xmath104 , the calculation ( the red solid curves ) shows that at energies below tens of tev , the neutrino flux is dominated by a @xmath3 component .",
    "taking the detection probability of @xmath105 for tev neutrinos ( gaisser et al .",
    "1995 ) , the expected flux of upward moving muons contributed by this @xmath3 component is about 8 - 10 events each year for a @xmath1 neutrino detector , such as icecube .",
    "we can also estimate the atmospheric neutrino background expectation in coincidence with these grb sources , noting that the search for neutrinos accompanying grbs requires that the neutrinos are coincident in both direction and time with gamma - rays .",
    "taking an average grb duration of @xmath106 s , an angular resolution of icecube of @xmath107 and the atmospheric neutrino background flux of @xmath108 at 1 tev ( ahrens et al .",
    "2004 ) , the atmospheric neutrino background expectation is @xmath109 events from 500 grbs ( in one year ) .",
    "such a low background in coincident with grbs allows the claim of detection of tev neutrinos from grb sources . at energies from a few tev to tens of tev ,",
    "the bethe - heilter cooling suppresses the @xmath3 cooling , resulting in a steepening at several tev in the neutrino spectrum . at energies above the threshold for @xmath36 interactions , the neutrino from @xmath36 process",
    "is heavily suppressed due to the strong radiative cooling of secondary pions . for a larger dissipation radius at @xmath110 ( the blue dashed curves ) , the neutrino emission flux from @xmath36 process",
    "is no longer suppressed and in this case both @xmath3 and @xmath36 neutrino components could be detected by @xmath1 detectors .",
    "we also calculated the neutrino flux , shown by the green dotted lines in fig .",
    "2 , for shock at photosphere radius @xmath111 , assuming that the radiation spectrum is a broken power - law ( due to comptonization ) peaking at @xmath112 , with lower energy and higher energy photon indexes given by @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively . in this case , the @xmath3 neutrino flux becomes small ( may be marginally detectable ) , while the @xmath36 neutrino flux spectrum is similar to the analytic result obtained by waxman & bahcall ( 1997 ) , as expected for a broken power - law photon spectrum .",
    "note that in one burst the shock dissipation could be continuous from small to large radii , as indicated by the larger variability timescales seen in grbs . by comparing the three cases of different dissipation radii in fig.2",
    ", one can see that as the shock radius increases , the neutrino emission from @xmath3 component decreases , while the @xmath36 component increases until it reaches the saturation level . the total @xmath3 neutrino flux from such continuous dissipation",
    "is thus contributed predominantly by the deepest internal shocks below the photosphere . in the whole neutrino spectrum ,",
    "a  valley \" is seen between the @xmath3 and @xmath36 components of the spectrum , which may be a potential distinguish feature of the sub - photosphere dissipation effect .",
    "waxman & bahcall ( 1997 ) as well as later works have studied the neutrino emission from the photomeson process during the prompt internal shocks of grbs , assuming that the radiation in the shock region has a broken power - law nonthermal spectrum .",
    "it was found that the neutrino emission peaks at energies above @xmath115 tev . towards lower energies ,",
    "the neutrino emission intensity decreases as @xmath116 ( waxman & bahcall 1997 ) .",
    "however , if internal shocks , especially at the early stage of the prompt emission , occur below the photosphere , a quasi - thermal spectrum will arise . in this _",
    ", we have discussed the neutrino emission associated with the dissipative photosphere that produces such prompt thermal emission .",
    "we find that @xmath3 interaction process becomes important for shock - accelerated protons and provides a new neutrino component , which dominates at energies below tens of tev .",
    "the neutrino emission from photopion process of protons interacting with the sub - photosphere radiation could be significantly suppressed due to radiative cooling of secondary pions , when the dissipation radius is relatively small .",
    "nevertheless , the total contribution by photopion process will not be suppressed since the shock dissipation could be continuous and occur at large radii as well . although tev neutrinos may also be produced during the early precursor stage of grb , i.e. before the jet breaking out the progenitor star ( e.g. razzaque et al .",
    "2004 ; ando & beacom 2005 ) , we want to point out that the tev neutrino component discussed here can be distinguished from them , because in our case the neutrino emission is associated in time with the prompt emission .",
