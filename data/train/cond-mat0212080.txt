    "electron - electron interactions lead to the formation of local moments and to the kondo effect in magnetic impurities in metals@xcite , and in quantum dots attached to metallic leads@xcite .",
    "this effect is the direct consequence of the coulomb repulsion between electrons which occupy the same quantum level of the impurity or quantum dot .",
    "if we assume that the main physical features of the impurity ( or the dot ) are governed by a single quantum level , the leading correction to the intralevel coulomb interaction is an assisted hopping term .",
    "this interaction induces a dependence of the coupling of the impurity ( or the dot ) and its environment on the occupancy of the level@xcite .    in the following",
    ", we estimate the magnitude of such a term for models of large atoms and quantum dots , and analyze its effects on the formation of a local moment on the impurity , or quantum dot . for bulk systems ,",
    "the inclusion of an assisted hopping term in the electronic hamiltonian favors the existence of pairing correlations@xcite . in the case of an impurity ,",
    "this tendency towards local pairing quenches the local moment , and , for quantum dots , it can lead to asymmetries in the conductance of peaks associated to the same level , and even to an enhancement of the conductances at low temperatures .",
    "the model is described in the following section iia .",
    "simple estimates of the magnitude of the assisted hopping term for quantum dots are discussed in section iib .",
    "a mean field analysis is given in sections iiia and iiib .",
    "extensions of the mean field approach are presented in section iiic .",
    "section iv contains the main conclusions .",
    "we analyze a single quantum level , associated to the creation operator @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the spin .",
    "this level is coupled to a continuum of non interacting electrons , described by operators @xmath2 . for simplicity , we assume that a single channel in the environment interacts with the impurity@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the volume of the system , and : @xmath5 the density of states of the conduction band at the fermi level is @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 . without loss of generality",
    ", we will set @xmath8 , and define @xmath9 .    when @xmath10 we recover the standard model proposed by anderson for the study of the formation of local moments in metals@xcite .",
    "this model is determined by three parameters , the coulomb repulsion @xmath11 , the position of the level @xmath12 , and its width , @xmath13 .",
    "the model has electron - hole symmetry around @xmath14 .    the assisted hopping term in eq.([hamil ] )",
    "is the next leading interaction in terms of @xmath15 operators which can be added to the anderson hamiltonian , assuming the same truncated hilbert space .",
    "as discussed later , it can be derived from intradot interactions only .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) intorduces an additional dimensionless parameter , @xmath16 . for small atoms",
    ", @xmath16 is a number of order unity@xcite .",
    "the inclusion of this term in the hamiltonian breaks the electron - hole symmetry of the initial anderson hamiltonian .",
    "we assume that the assisted hopping term in eq.([hamil ] ) arises from interactions which involve electronic levels within the dot only . when the hamiltonian is truncated to the hilbert space defined by a single state within the dot , and the leads , the electron - electron interactions within the dot can induce , among others , a term of this type .",
    "our initial hamiltonian is : @xmath18 we have assumed that the lead contains a single channel .",
    "the index @xmath19 labels all quantum numbers of the states within the dot , including spin .",
    "we are interested in transitions where the charge state of the dot changes from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , and from @xmath21 to @xmath22 . in the absence of interactions , they correspond to the filling of a particular level , which we denote @xmath19 .",
    "when the charge state of the dot is @xmath20 , all levels @xmath23 such that @xmath24 are occuppied .",
    "we use as basis for the electronic states in the dot the hartree - fock wavefunctions defined when for charge state @xmath20 .",
    "rearrangements of the electronic levels imply that the corresponding wavefunctions for charge states @xmath21 and @xmath22 are different@xcite .",
    "typically , the tunneling between the dot and the lead takes place in a region of atomic size at some point of the surface of the dot , @xmath25 .",
    "then , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the wavefunction of state @xmath19 .",
    "we now assume that the broadening of the levels due to the coupling to the leads , @xmath28 is smaller than the mean level spacing , @xmath29 .",
    "then , the effective tunneling can be estimated from the ground state wavefunctions of the dot for different charge states : @xmath30 and the difference between adding two electrons to state @xmath19 , and adding one is : @xmath31      for large dots , the interaction terms decrease with the size and conductance of the dot@xcite , so that a perturbative calculation of @xmath17 is possible .",
    "as mentioned above , we use the electronic basis which diagonalize the hartree - fock approximation to @xmath32 in charge state @xmath20 , which we denote @xmath33 .",
    "we can define @xmath34 , and the wavefunctions : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ground state of @xmath33 ( note that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are not the hartree - fock approximations to the wavefunction of the dot with charge @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath39 , when acting on @xmath40 induces two electron - hole pairs .",
    "the occupation of level @xmath19 in wavefunctions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the induced interaction between this electron and the rest implies that the basis which diagonalizes @xmath33 is not longer optimal .",
    "then , @xmath39 acting on these wavefunctions leads to excited states with one and two electron - hole pairs .",
    "a sketch of the corrections to the wavefunctions is shown in fig.[[wave ] ] .",
    "matrix elements which involve one and two electron - hole pairs have a different dependence on the size of the dot ( see below ) .",
    "we will calculate @xmath17 to second order in the matrix elements associated to one electron - hole pair , @xmath41 , and to first order in the matrix elements involving two pairs , @xmath42 .",
    "we use eqs .",
    "( [ overlap ] ) and ( [ deltav ] ) , and we need to calculate the wavefunctions @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "generically , we can write :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 describe states with zero , one and two electron - hole pairs .    the operator @xmath48 in eq.([overlap ] )",
    "can , at most , change by one the number of electron - hole pairs in the wavefunction . hence , there are no contributions to eq.([overlap ] ) which are of first order in @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , the terms in the second line in eq.([perturbation ] ) are of second order in @xmath41 and lead to wavefunctions with , at least , one electron - hole pair .",
    "their contributions are of third order in @xmath41 , and need not be considered . as the basis set used gives the hartree - fock solution for charge state @xmath20 , we have that : @xmath49 which implies that the corrections to @xmath50 are of second order in @xmath41 . finally ,",
    "adding all contributions , we find :    @xmath51    where : @xmath52 and we assume that all levels are doubly degenerate .    eq.([dvperturbation ] ) implies that electron - electron interactions within the dot give rise to a first order correction to the hopping , whose sign depends on the nature of the interaction , and a second order correction which tends to suppress the hopping . in the limit where the level spacing within the dot is negligible with respect to the temperature and charging energy , these terms change into the non equilibrium corrections to the effective tunneling density of states analyzed in@xcite .",
    "note that in in addition to the correction to the hopping given in eq.([dvperturbation ] ) , the polarization of the occuppied levels , @xmath24 , gives a correction to @xmath53 which does not depend on the number of electrons in state @xmath19 .",
    "we now apply the previous analysis to the case of a spherical dot of radius @xmath54 and @xmath55 electrons . for simplicity , we assume that the positive charge needed to stabilize the system is uniformly distributed within the radius @xmath54 . the level spacing is : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the fermi wavevector , and @xmath58 is the mass of the electrons . for sufficently large electronic densities , @xmath59 , the coulomb repulsion between electrons can be treated using the fermi - thomas approximation . within this approximation , @xmath41 is given by the fermi - thomas potential induced by the addition of a unit of of charge to the dot . for a three dimensional spherical dot , this potential is@xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the radial coordinate , and @xmath62 is the fermi - thomas wavelength .",
    "in addition to this term , we have to include a short range interaction which leads to the excitation of two electron - hole pairs when expanding around the hertree - fock solution , @xmath42 in eq.([dvperturbation ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath41 decay as @xmath63 for @xmath64 , while those of @xmath42 decay as @xmath65 , justifying the separation of scales used in obtaining eq.([dvperturbation ] ) .",
    "the potential @xmath66 is localized within a shell of size @xmath67 around the edges of the dot .",
    "we assume that the matrix elements @xmath68 are roughly constant if @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and zero otherwise . as the level spacing is given in eq.([spacing ] ) , the number of levels for which the matrix elements of @xmath66 are not negligible is @xmath71 . within this energy window , we can also assume that @xmath72 , so that the the correction to @xmath17 , using eq.([dvperturbation ] ) , is the sum of @xmath71 terms of the same sign . finally , @xmath66 conserves angular momentum .",
    "the maximum angular momentum in a sphere of radius @xmath54 is approximately @xmath73 .    defining : @xmath74 we find that the first ( linear ) and second ( quadratic ) contributions to @xmath17 are : @xmath75 where the @xmath76 factor to @xmath77 arises from the number of angular momentum channels . we have obtained that the two corrections are of similar magnitude , and decay as @xmath78 .      the low energy levels and wavefunctions of quantum dots in the diffusive regime",
    "are well described using random matrix theory .",
    "we consider a dot of average radius @xmath54 , mean free path @xmath79 , and mean level separation @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the electron density is large , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 . the electron - electron interaction can be expanded in powers of the inverse conductance , @xmath82 , where @xmath83@xcite .    as in the case considered in the previous subsection ,",
    "the leading term in an expansion in @xmath84 arise from the fermi - thomas potential , eq.([ft ] ) , upon the addition of electrons .",
    "this potential is determined solely by the geometry of the dot and electrostatic constraints , and is independent of the details of the dynamics of the electrons .",
    "we use the matrix elements of @xmath66 calculated for a diffusive dot in@xcite . as in eq.([dvterms ] ) , we find two contributions , @xmath85 and @xmath77 .",
    "the average over disorder of @xmath85 is zero , with mean fluctuations : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "the @xmath88 correction is due to the summation over states such that @xmath89 .    to next order in @xmath84",
    ", we find : @xmath90 for dots of similar radii , @xmath17 is larger in the diffusive regime than in the regular case . for chaotic , ballistic dots",
    ", it seems reasonable to replace @xmath91 by @xmath73 in eqs.([dvterm1],[dvterm2 ] ) .",
    "we now consider the hamiltonian in eq.([hamil ] ) . we first analyze possible magnetic solutions .",

    "leading to a @xmath95 matrix equation for the components of the green s function for each spin index projected on the @xmath96 and @xmath15 sites : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the spin index , and we have defined : @xmath99 for the nonmagnetic solution , the different components of the density of states are ( omitting spin indices ) : @xmath100 where : @xmath101 the self consistent relations required in eq.([hamilmf ] ) , and the green s functions in eq.([green ] ) imply that : @xmath102\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the symmetric anderson model , we have @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "the equations for the magnetic solution , in the limit of small magnetization , are analyzed in the appendix .",
    "numerical results of the occupancies of the different spin states as function of @xmath105 and @xmath106 are shown in fig.[[results ] ] .",
    "alternatively , we can use the bcs decoupling and write a mean field hamiltonian :    @xmath107 + h. c. \\label{hamilbcs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this hamiltonian couples up spin electrons with down spin holes , and viceversa .",
    "the green s function projected on the electron and hole states at sites @xmath96 and @xmath15 can be written in terms of two @xmath108 matrices :    @xmath109    where the two upper ( lower ) rows correspond to electrons ( holes ) , and we have defined : @xmath110 the selfconsistency condition implicit in eq.([green_bcs ] ) can be linearized , as outlined in the appendix .      the impurity model studied here can be considered as a ( 0 + 1 ) dimensional model , where fluctuations in time need to be considered . in principle , we can integrate out the fermion in the leads , and obtain an effective four state model .",
    "the four states correspond to the four occupancies of the single state at the impurity , as defined in eq.([hamil ] ) .",
    "these states have long range interactions in time , as in related fermionic and bosonic problems@xcite .",
    "the fluctuations in time will tend to restore the symmetries broken at the mean field level .",
    "we will use the mean field results as a guide to infer which type of universality class will determine the low temperature properties .",
    "the fact that the reduced hilbert space associated to the impurity includes only four states greatly restricts the possible low energy fixed points .",
    "the analysis in the two previous subsections suggests that there are two physical regimes : i ) near @xmath111 and for large values of @xmath112 , a local magnetic moment is induced , and , ii ) away from @xmath111 , and for moderate values of @xmath112 , pairing correlations develop near the dot or impurity .",
    "we identify the local moment regime studied earlier with the kondo effect .",
    "note , however , that the relation between the kondo temperature and the parameters in the hamiltonian will be changed by the assisted hopping term .",
    "pairing fluctuations imply that charge states which differ by two are strongly mixed in the ground state .",
    "this can be checked by the exact diagonalization of a block containing the impurity and a few sites in the leads .",
    "the assisted hopping term leads to an effective negative @xmath113 model , where @xmath114 , for certain values of @xmath20 .",
    "these relatively small blocks , when attached to the rest of the leads will act as local defects with a tendency towards pairing .",
    "hence , we conclude that the bcs solution identified in the mean field approximation corresponds to a regime described by the negative @xmath11 anderson model .",
    "we have analyzed the influence of assisted hopping in correlated impurities embedded in a metal , or quantum dots coupled to leads .",
    "this type of interaction is the simplest term which can be defined in the restricted basis given by a single quantum level within the dot . related effects , in the opposite limit where the states within the dot can be treated as a continuum were studied in@xcite .",
    "we have estimated , in section ii , the magnitude of this term for simple models of regular and diffusive dots . in the latter case , we find that the assisted hopping term has a similar dependence on the conductance of the dot as the interaction corrections to the peak spacing@xcite . the assisted hopping term is directly related to the changes of the wavefunctions within the dot upon the addition of a single electron .",
    "this interaction will be larger than estimated in section ii in one and two dimensional geometries as the fermi - thomas potential is more extended , and for low electronic density@xcite .",
    "note also that the orthogonality catastrophe is expected to be enhanced in disordered two dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "we have only taken into account the interactions within the dot . in devices with more than one dot",
    ", the interactions between electrons in different dots will also enhance the effects reproted here .",
    "assisted hopping can contribute to change the peak height distribution with respect to that predicted by random matrix theory@xcite .",
    "our results suggest that assisted hopping can lead to local pairing correlations for reasonable values of the parameters .",
    "this implies enhanced conductivity through the dot or impurity , significant deviations from the electron - hole symmetry implicit in the kondo effect , and measurable differences in the conductance through the two peaks associated to the same quantum level .",
    "the existence of these effects does not seem incompatible with present experimental evidence@xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of assisted hopping effects quantum dots , in the limit of large level spacing , deserves further investigation .",
