    "the relation between neutron star properties which are obtained from adequate equations of state ( eos ) and the neutron skin thickness has long been a topic of investigation in the literature .",
    "the details of this relation and the important quantities to be discussed have been well established in @xcite , where it was shown that the difference between the neutron and the proton radii , the neutron skin thickness , is linearly correlated with the pressure of neutron matter at sub - nuclear densities .",
    "this is so because the properties of neutron stars are obtained from appropriate eos whose symmetry energy depends on the density and also controls the size of the neutron skin thickness in heavy and asymmetric nuclei , as @xmath0 pb , for instance .",
    "it is important to remember that the eos in neutron stars is also very isospin asymmetric due to the @xmath1- equilibrium constraint .",
    "hence , isospin asymmetry plays a major role in the understanding of the density dependence of the symmetry energy and the consequences it may arise @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the models that yield smaller neutron skins in heavy nuclei tend to yield smaller neutron star radii due to a softer eos .",
    "neutron stars are believed to have a solid crust formed by nonuniform neutron rich matter in @xmath1-equilibrium above a liquid mantle . in the inner crust nuclei",
    "coexist with a gas of neutrons which have dripped out .",
    "the properties of this crust as , for instance , its thickness and pressure at the crust - core interface depend a lot on the density dependence of the eos used to describe it @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well known @xcite that the existence of phase transitions from liquid to gas phases in asymmetric nuclear matter ( anm ) is intrinsically related with the instability regions which are limited by the spinodals .",
    "instabilities in anm described within relativistic mean field hadron models , both with constant and density dependent couplings at zero and finite temperatures have already been investigated @xcite and it was shown that the main differences occur at finite temperature and large isospin asymmetry close to the boundary of the instability regions . in neutral neutron - proton - electron ( npe ) matter the electrons are also included . in a thermodynamical calculation",
    "the instabilities almost completely disappear due to the high electron fermi energy @xcite .",
    "however , in a dynamical calculation which includes the coulomb interaction and allows for independent neutron , proton and electron fluctuations @xcite , it is seen that the electron dynamics tends to restore the short wavelength instabilities although moderated by the high electron fermi energy .",
    "moreover , it is also known that the liquid - gas phase transition in anm can lead to an isospin distillation phenomenon , characterized by a larger proton fraction in the liquid phase than in the gas phase .",
    "this is due to the repulsive isovector channel of the nuclear interaction @xcite .    in a recent work the spinodal section and related quantities ,",
    "as the neutron to proton density fluctuations responsible for the distillation effect , has been studied within different relativistic models @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the distillation effect within density dependent relativistic models decreases with density above a nuclear density of @xmath2 @xmath3 , a result similar to the one obtained with the sly230a parametrization of skyrme interaction @xcite and contrary to the results found with the more common relativistic parametrizations with no density dependent coupling parameters . in the last case",
    "the distillation effect becomes always larger as the density increases .    also , the behavior of the symmetry energy obtained with density dependent models is closer to what one obtains with non - relativistic models than with other relativistic models with constant couplings @xcite . in an attempt to understand this behavior ,",
    "a comparison between the non - relativistic skyrme effective force and relativistic mean field models at subsaturation densities was performed @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the relativistic models could also be reduced to an energy density functional similar to the one describing the skyrme interaction .",
    "there have already been some efforts in order to compare nuclear matter and finite nuclei properties obtained both with relativistic and non - relativistic models @xcite but there is no clear or obvious explanations for the differences . at very low densities both , the relativistic and the non - relativistic approaches predict a non - homogeneous phase commonly named _ pasta phase _ , formed by a competition between the long - range coulomb repulsion and the short - range nuclear attraction @xcite .    based on the above arguments ,",
    "it is very important that an accurate experimental measurement of the neutron skin thickness is achieved .",
    "this depends on a precise measurement of both the charge and the neutron radius .",
    "the charge radius is already known within a precision of one percent for most stable nuclei , using the well - known single - arm and non - polarized elastic electron scattering technique as well as the spectroscopy of muonic atoms @xcite .",
    "for the neutron radius , our present knowledge has an uncertainty of about 0.2 fm @xcite .",
    "however , using polarized electron beams it is possible to obtain the neutron distribution in nuclei in a fairly model independent way , as first discussed in @xcite and , as a consequence , to obtain the desired neutron radius . in fact , the parity radius experiment ( prex ) at the jefferson laboratory @xcite is currently running to measure the @xmath0pb neutron radius with an accuracy of less than 0.05 fm , using polarized electron scattering .",
    "in the present work , we use two different hadronic models that incorporate density dependence in different ways . the first one , to which we refer next as the tw model is a density dependent hadronic model with the meson - to - nucleon couplings explicitly dependent of the density @xcite . in the following it is used to calculate the neutron skin thickness of @xmath0pb , which is a neutron - rich heavy nucleus .",
    "this model was chosen because it is based on a microscopic calculation , fits well many nuclei properties and , as stated above , has shown to provide results which are different from the usual nl3 @xcite and tm1 @xcite parametrizations for the non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) , having a richer density dependence of the symmetry energy than most of the relativistic nuclear models . the original motivation for the development of this density dependent hadronic model @xcite was to reproduce results obtained with the relativistic dirac - brueckner hartree - fock ( dbhf ) theory @xcite .",
    "later the dbhf calculations for nuclear matter were taken only as a guide for a suitable parametrization of the density dependence of the meson - nucleon coupling operators @xcite . moreover",
    ", density dependent hadronic models can also be a useful tool in obtaining eos for neutron stars even if hyperons are to be considered @xcite , which is not the case if nl3 or tm1 are used .",
    "both , nl3 and tm1 , can only be used if the eos is restricted to accommodate neutrons , protons and the leptons necessary to enforce @xmath1-stability .",
    "once hyperons are included , the nucleons acquire a negative effective mass above @xmath4 densities @xcite , where @xmath5 is the nuclear saturation density .",
    "the second model , that we refer to as nl@xmath6 model , includes non - linear @xmath7 and @xmath8 couplings @xcite which allow to change the density dependence of the symmetry energy of the most common parametrizations of the nlwm that show essentially a linear behavior of the symmetry energy with density .",
    "however , the symmetry energy determines the behavior of isospin asymmetric matter and therefore is intrinsically related to the characteristics of the eos that can describe neutron stars . within this model",
    "the authors of @xcite have shown that the neutron skin thickness of @xmath9 was sensitive to the isovector channel of the nuclear interaction and there was a correlation between neutron skin thickness of nuclei and properties of neutron stars .",
    "for the sake of completeness , the results of the present work , whenever possible are compared with the results obtained with the nl3 parametrization of the nlwm , known to describe finite nuclei properties well .",
    "we perform two different numerical calculations to obtain the @xmath0pb properties : a thomas - fermi approximation based on the liquid - gas phase transition developed in @xcite and a thomas - fermi approximation based on a method proposed in @xcite , where a harmonic oscillator basis is used .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the thomas - fermi approximation because , as we show in the results section at the end of the paper , for the purpose of obtaining correct surface energy and neutron - skin thickness , it is almost as good as the solution of the dirac equation .    at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that the scalar - isovector @xmath10 mesons , which play an important role in the isospin channel , could also be incorporated in our work as done in @xcite but in order to make the comparisons among different approximations as simple as possible , they will be included in a future work .",
    "finally , as we are interested in nuclei ground state properties , all calculations are performed at zero temperature .",
    "next we describe the main quantities of the tw model , which has density dependent coupling parameters .",
    "the lagrangian density reads : @xmath11 @xmath12\\psi\\ ] ] @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the scalar - isoscalar , vector - isoscalar and vector - isovector meson fields and the photon field respectively , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the parameters of the model are : the nucleon mass @xmath24 mev , the masses of the mesons @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath28 and the density dependent coupling constants @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which are adjusted in order to reproduce some of the nuclear matter bulk properties shown in table [ bulk ] , using the following parametrization : @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 ,   \\label{paratw2}\\ ] ] with the values of the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 given in @xcite .",
    "this model does not include self - interaction terms for the meson fields ( i.e. @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) as in nl3 or tm1 parametrizations for the nlwm .",
    "the field equations of motion follow from the euler - lagrange equations . when they are obtained , some care has to be taken since the coupling operators depend on the baryon fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 through the density .",
    "when the partial derivatives of @xmath47 are performed relatively to the fields @xmath48 and",
    "@xmath46 , they yield extra terms due to the functional dependence of the coupling operators .",
    "the new terms are absent in the usual quantum hadrodynamic ( qhd , nlwm ) models @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for the fields read :    @xmath49 \\psi&=&0 ~ , \\label{dirac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 .",
    "notice that in the equation of motion for the baryon field @xmath46 the vector self - energy consists of two terms , @xmath51 = @xmath52 + @xmath53 , where : @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath52 is the usual vector self - energy , @xmath56 with @xmath57 @xmath58 , @xmath59 and , as a result of the derivative of the lagrangian with respect to @xmath60 a new term appears , @xmath53 , which is called rearrangement self - energy and has been shown to play an essential rle in the applications of the theory .",
    "this term guarantees the thermodynamical consistency and the energy - momentum conservation . for more detailed calculations , at zero and finite temperatures ,",
    "please refer to @xcite .",
    "in the static case there are no currents in the nucleus and the spatial vector components are zero .",
    "therefore , the mesonic equations of motion become : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the scalar density , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the proton and neutron densities .",
    "we first define the functional @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the energy , @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is the proton ( neutron ) chemical potential and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) is the proton ( neutron ) number . within the semi - classical thomas - fermi approximation , the energy of the nuclear system with particles described by the one - body phase - space distribution function @xmath76 at position @xmath77 , instant @xmath78 with momentum @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82\\ ] ] where @xmath83    @xmath84 refers to the spin multiplicity and the distribution functions for protons and neutrons are @xmath85 in this approach , the scalar , proton and neutron densities become : @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 from the above expressions we get for ( [ omega ] ) @xmath89 + v_{ef}\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath90 - \\mu_p \\rho_p-\\mu_n \\rho_n\\ ] ] @xmath91    minimization of @xmath92 with respect to @xmath93 , gives rise to the following conditions @xmath94 and @xmath95 where the rearrangement term is @xmath96 from the above equations we obtain @xmath97 and @xmath98 or , for @xmath99 or @xmath100 different from zero , @xmath101 @xmath102 the values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 are obtained inverting these two last equations .",
    "such density dependences in the coupling parameters do not affect the energy functional but of course affect its derivative such as the pressure density and the chemical potentials . as already discussed in the literature @xcite , the rearrangement term is crucial in obtaining different behaviors in physical properties related to the chemical potentials or to their derivatives with respect to the density , such as spinodal regions , as compared with the more common nl3 or tm1 parametrizations .",

    "non - linear @xmath117 terms are also included .",
    "we have followed the prescription of @xcite , where the starting point was the nl3 parametrization and the @xmath115 coupling was adjusted for each value of the coupling @xmath118 studied in such a way that for @xmath119 @xmath120 ( not the saturation point ) the symmetry energy is 25.68 mev . in the present work we set @xmath121 as in @xcite .",
    "notice that other possibilities for this model with @xmath7 and @xmath8 couplings have already been discussed in the literature as in @xcite , for instance .",
    "the mesonic equations of motion in the thomas - fermi approximation become    @xmath122    @xmath123    @xmath124    @xmath125    and the expression for the energy reads    @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129\\ ] ] @xmath130    all other expressions are very similar to the ones obtained from the tw model and can be read off from them bearing in mind that the density dependent couplings have to be replaced by the constant couplings .",
    "in particular the chemical potentials do not contain the rearrangement term @xmath131 .",
    "at this point , eqs .",
    "( [ elphi]-[ela0 ] ) for the tw model and eqs .",
    "( [ elphi2]-[ela02 ] ) for the nl@xmath6 model have to be solved numerically in a self - consistent way and hence , initial and boundary conditions for each equation are necessary .",
    "one of the methods we use here is based on a prescription given in @xcite , where these conditions are obtained from a situation of phase coexistence in a mean field approximation with classical meson fields and no electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the method is well explained in @xcite and , as we are using different models here , just the main equations are written next .",
    "based on the geometrical construction and gibbs conditions for phase coexistence , i.e. , the pressure and both chemical potentials are equal in both phases , we build the binodal section given in fig .",
    "[ binodais ] .",
    "notice that we have defined the proton fraction of the system as @xmath142 the binodal section yields the boundary conditions which we need . for the same pressure ,",
    "two points , with different proton fractions are found . for each of these points , the meson fields and the densities",
    "are well defined and used as the initial and boundary conditions in eqs .",

    "the solution is a droplet with a certain proton fraction surrounded by a gas of neutrons .",
    "if stable nuclei are calculated , the gas vanishes because the energy of the system lies below the neutron drip line and the finite nuclei properties are easily calculated .",
