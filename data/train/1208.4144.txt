    "ferroelectrics find many industrial and commercial applications , such as in high - dielectric constant capacitors , ferroelectric thin - film memories , piezoelectric transducers , nonlinear optical devices , and switches .",
    "the performance of many kinds of ferroelectric devices is affected by the ferroelectric domain structure and the properties of the domain boundaries .",
    "for example , a recent experiment has shown that the observed dielectric permittivity of a batio@xmath0 single crystal in the rhombohedral phase varies depending on the domain structures induced by pre - treatments at higher temperatures.@xcite such influences on the mechanical and electrical properties of devices has motivated theoretical and experimental work directed toward obtaining a better understanding of ferroelectric domain structures .",
    "ferroelectric domain walls ( fdws ) are usually considered to be of ising type , in which @xmath2 , the projection of the polarization vector onto the plane of the domain wall , simply reverses itself by passing through zero along a high - symmetry path as one scans through the domain wall .",
    "ising fdws tend to be favored because ferroelectrics are generally strongly electrostrictive , so that a rotation of @xmath2 away from this high - symmetry path would entail a significant elastic energy cost .",
    "in contrast , the spontaneous magnetostriction which couples the magnetization and lattice strain in ferromagnetic materials is typically much weaker . as a result , magnetic domain walls are usually much wider , on the order of microns , and the magnetization vector can rotate away from the high - symmetry path . the domain wall is denoted as a bloch or nel wall depending on whether this rotation occurs in a plane parallel or normal to the domain wall , respectively .    in recent years , however , there have been some theoretical predictions of the presence of bloch and even nel components in some ferroelectric materials and heterostructures.@xcite in particular , it has been predicted , in the framework of a phenomenological ginzburg - landau - devonshire ( gld ) model , that the 180@xmath3 fdws in rhombohedral batio@xmath0 should be of bloch type.@xcite this work has motivated us to test whether this behavior is also reproduced by first - principles density - functional calculations on batio@xmath0 .",
    "since the discovery of ferroelectricity in this material in 1954,@xcite batio@xmath0 has been very widely studied and has emerged as a kind of prototypical ferroelectric compound .",
    "it undergoes a sequence of phase transitions from a high - temperature paraelectric cubic phase to ferroelectric tetragonal , orthorhombic , and finally rhombohedral phases as the temperature is reduced .",
    "here we are interested in the zero - temperature rhombohedral phase , in which the spontaneous polarization prefers to lie in eight energetically equivalent directions , as shown by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - dir ] .",
    "the figure also shows the possible rotation angles between the spontaneous polarization directions on the two sides of the domain wall ( relative to the arrow marked as ` 0 ' ) . in the low - temperature rhombohedral phase of batio@xmath0 ,",

    "while first - principles calculations have been successfully applied to study fdws in many other cases,@xcite we are not aware of any previous application to the case of the rhombohedral phase of batio@xmath0 .",

    "the energy difference between the bloch r109@xmath1 and ising r109@xmath1 fdw is very small , which suggests that both types of the domain wall are possible .",
    "the bloch walls can be regarded as being composed of two ising walls of smaller angles .",
    "a comparison of the sum of the energies of these constituting ising walls with that of an ising - type solution can explain why the polarization vector picks a bloch - type path in some fdws .",
