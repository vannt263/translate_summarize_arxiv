    "it is well known that cp - violation in @xmath6 mixing is described by the parameter @xmath2 . within the sm",
    ", this parameter is given by box diagrams .",
    "it depends in particular on the ckm matrix elements , to which vertices of box diagrams are proportional . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimentally measured parameters are @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath7 enter the measured ratios of decay amplitudes of kaons into @xmath8 states .",
    "these amplitudes are superpositions of amplitudes @xmath9 of kaon decays into states with definite isospin @xmath10 , @xmath11 are weak amplitudes , @xmath12 are strong rescattering phases of @xmath13-mesons",
    ". the parameter @xmath1 can be expressed as @xcite :    @xmath14    within the sm and in the standard parametrization of ckm matrix , @xmath15 originates from the so - called strong penguin diagrams .",
    "amplitude @xmath16 also has an imaginary part which originates from electro - weak penguin diagrams .",
    "that is why @xmath17 .",
    "taking into account that the phases of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are approximately @xmath18 @xcite , from eq.([1 ] ) we obtain :    @xmath19    the estimation of @xmath20 was done in @xcite .",
    "this term appears to be a @xmath21 correction to the value of @xmath2 in eq.([2 ] ) .",
    "provided that we have estimated the right - hand side of eq.([2 ] ) with the help of eq.([tilde epsilon ] ) we can determine parameter @xmath3 , which parameterizes hadronic matrix element .",
    "of course , for this purpose we need to know the values of ckm matrix elements that enter eq.([tilde epsilon ] ) .    the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 of ckm matrix appear to be constrained without using the value of @xmath2 in the fit .",
    "thus we perform the fit of ckm matrix parameters without using constraint from @xmath2 in it",
    ". then we determine @xmath3 from eqs.([2]),([tilde epsilon ] ) .",
    "our result is @xmath24 .",
    "this result is close to the result of vacuum insertion : @xmath5 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the insertions of @xmath13-mesons states should be taken into account .",
    "these insertions form a sign - alternating series , who s terms depend on the cutoff momentum of @xmath13-mesons .",
    "this cutoff can be reasonably chosen to be @xmath25 ( at larger virtualities @xmath13-mesons do not exist ) .",
    "then the sign - alternating series converges quickly , and one can take only first two terms . thus taking into account the insertions of @xmath13-mesons",
    "states lowers @xmath3 , and the agreement with our result improves further .",
    "the lattice result of @xmath3 calculation is @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we see that our result is very close to it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ teps ] we discuss various estimations of the value of @xmath20 . in section",
    "[ fit ] we perform the fit of ckm matrix parameters without using constraint from @xmath27 in it . in section  [ extraction ]",
    "we determine @xmath3 and compare it with other results of calculation of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we make our conclusion in section  [ concl ] .",
    "in this section we review the estimation of @xmath29 @xcite . we discuss the following three methods .",
    "first , one can use the experimental data on cp - violation in semileptonic @xmath30-decays , namely parameter @xmath31 .",
    "this method possesses large uncertainty and also at the level of two sigmas contradicts the experimental value of @xmath32 .",
    "second , one can obtain the lower bound on @xmath28 from the experimental value of @xmath32 .",
    "this lower bound is important in understanding the relative magnitude of the second term in eq.([2 ] ) , it turns out to be @xmath33 .",
    "third , we use the results of direct computation of @xmath34 in the ratio @xmath20 , substituting the experimental value of @xmath35 .",
    "this gives us a reliable estimate of @xmath20 with moderate error , which we use in the bulk of the paper .",
    "first , we estimate the value of @xmath2 from the experimental results on cp - violation in semileptonic @xmath30 decays :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 .",
    "now let us substitute the experimental data .",
    "for @xmath38 we use @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "world average value of @xmath31 , published in @xcite , contains new ktev result : @xmath40 .",
    "na48 collaboration recently obtained : @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "averaging these two numbers we get : @xmath42 .",
    "this leads to the following value of @xmath27 :    @xmath43    from eq.([2 ] ) with the help of eq.([5 ] ) we can find the corresponding value of @xmath20 :    @xmath44    we will show below , that this number almost contradicts the present experimental value of @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "second method of estimation of @xmath46 , which gives the lower bound on it , uses the experimental value of @xmath32 . the expression for @xmath32",
    "is usually presented as follows @xcite :    @xmath47~,\\ ] ]    let us neglect the term proportional to @xmath48 in eq.([3 ] ) , which comes from the ew penguins .",
    "taking into account that @xmath49 @xcite , we obtain the following expression for @xmath20 from eq.([3 ] ) :    @xmath50    substituting experimental values from @xcite , we get : @xmath51    in this way we get the following value of @xmath52 :    @xmath53 ) , the contribution of ew penguins partially cancels that of qcd penguin , the value @xmath54 should be considered as a lower bound on @xmath55 and eq.([6 ] ) is a lower bound on @xmath56 .",
    "thus the central value of @xmath20 , obtained from semileptonic @xmath30-decays , eq.([105 ] ) , almost contradicts the experimental value of @xmath32 .",
    "finally , the reliable way to estimate @xmath57 , result of which we will use in the next sections is to use the experimental value of @xmath35 and theoretical value for @xmath15 .",
    "calculation of @xmath35 and @xmath15 , as well as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , has a long history .",
    "the calculation of @xmath35 and @xmath60 was performed in order to explain the @xmath61 rule in kaon decays and the calculation of @xmath15 and @xmath48 - in order to explain the observed value of @xmath32 .    in this paper",
    "we perform the calculation of @xmath15 to the following accuracy : the wilson coefficient is calculated to lo and hadronic matrix element is calculated in naive factorization approximation .",
    "the details are presented in appendix , and here we only quote the result :    @xmath62    we note that the results of computation of @xmath15 ( see @xcite - @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) performed by a large number of people lie in the same ballpark .    finally , from eq.([65 ] ) we can determine the value of @xmath0 :    @xmath63 .",
    "we use in our fit of the ckm matrix experimentally measured values of modulus of matrix elements @xmath64,@xmath65,@xmath66,@xmath67,@xmath68 , @xmath69 and also @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "note that we do not use @xmath2 in fit , since we plan to determine the value of @xmath3 with the help of the fit results .",
    "we assume these experimentally measured data to be normally distributed .",
    "also the theoretical uncertainties are treated as normally distributed .",
    "let us note that other people treat theoretical uncertainties in other way @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the table of input parameters looks like :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "from the results of the fit , presented above , we can extract the value of @xmath3 .",
    "for this purpose we use the theoretical expression for @xmath74 , first obtained in @xcite .",
    "it has the following form : @xmath75+\\eta_{tt } m_t^2 i(\\xi ) im[(v_{ts } v^*_{td})^2]\\nonumber\\\\    & & + 2\\eta_{ct } m_c^2 \\ln ( \\frac{m_w^2}{m_c^2 } )   im[v_{cs } v^*_{cd } v_{ts } v^*_{td } ] ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "quark masses are @xmath78 gev @xcite , @xmath79 gev @xcite , @xmath80 gev @xcite .",
    "the qcd corrections were calculated to leading order in @xcite : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the next - to - leading order calculation changes slightly @xmath84 and @xmath85 and changes considerably @xmath86 : @xmath87 @xcite , @xmath88 @xcite , @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the kaon decay constant extracted from the @xmath90 decay width equals : @xmath91 mev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath92 mass difference is @xmath93 gev @xcite .",
    "fermi constant @xmath94@xcite .",
    "now we equate this expression to the value of @xmath95 from eq.([10 ] ) , substituting all experimental numbers and the results of the fit .",
    "this leads to the following value of @xmath3 :    @xmath96    note that it is close to the result of vacuum insertion : @xmath5 .",
    "we have extracted the value of @xmath3 using the fitted values of ckm matrix elements and the estimated difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "our result is @xmath97 .",
    "it appears to be close to the result of vacuum insertion , @xmath5 , while lattice result is simply the same : @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to augusto ceccucci and ed blucher for providing us with the latest experimental data on @xmath31 .",
    "this work was partially supported by the program fs ntp fyaf 40.052.1.1.1112 and by grant nsh- 2328.2003.2 .",
    "g.o . is grateful to dynasty foundation for partial support .",
    "let s estimate @xmath99 , using experimental value of @xmath35 and evaluating the value of @xmath15 .",
    "the latter will be evaluated to the following accuracy : the lo wilson coefficients will be used , and hadronic matrix element will be calculated in naive factorization approximation .              it is convenient to perform calculation in the unitary gauge . each of the three diagrams ( see fig .  [ penguins ] ) is infinite , however the sum appears to be finite .",
    "we will use the dimensional regularization ( @xmath106 ) , in order to regularize divergent integrals :              dimensionless functions @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) depend on the values @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the up - quark mass in the loop .",
    "we suppose the external @xmath117 and @xmath118 quarks to be on mass shell .",
    "let us neglect d - quark mass . in this approximation",
    "the non - zero contribution into operator @xmath119 is given by the terms with formfactors @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce new variables @xmath122 and @xmath123 :      here the term proportional to @xmath125 will not contribute to operator @xmath119 , since @xmath126 .",
    "the quantity @xmath127 should be expressed through the magnetic formfactor with the help of the following equation :            it is sufficient to calculate the formfactors @xmath133 and @xmath121 in the zero order in @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "however , the formfactor @xmath134 , as it follows from last equations , should be calculated , including terms proportional to @xmath114 , @xmath113 . from equations ( [ diagrams ] ) , calculating appropriate integrals , we get :                      in order to understand at which virtuality @xmath148 should be taken in these expressions leading logarithms should be summed up .",
    "this was done for the real part of coefficient function in the paper @xcite :                                  in order to estimate the theoretical error for @xmath15 we propose the following method : to take two values of @xmath146 , corresponding to @xmath165 and @xmath166 , to calculate @xmath99 at each @xmath146 and from these boundary values get @xmath167 error for @xmath168 .",
    "this number is rather stable with respect to the variation of @xmath146 .",
    "our result confirms statement maid in @xcite : qcd penguin results in the value of @xmath32 in ballpark of the experimental data .",
    "substituting numbers and again taking @xmath146 at which @xmath165 and @xmath166 we get : @xmath171 .",
    "the central number is approximately 3 times smaller than the experimental , but theoretical uncertainty is large .",
