    "sdss j153636.22 + 044127.0 ( hereafter sdss j1536 + 0441 ) is certainly a peculiar and complex object .",
    "the attention to this low redshift qso was drawn by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bl09 ) in a search for quasars exhibiting components with multiple redshifts among the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "they found three line systems at different redshifts : two sets of broad - line emission at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and a third set of narrow absorption lines at @xmath6 .",
    "narrow emission lines were found associated only to the higher redshift system .",
    "bl09 interpreted these peculiar features in terms of a massive black hole binary ( bhb ) system within the same galaxy with separation of @xmath7 pc and masses of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , each with its own broad line region and sharing the same narrow line region .",
    "bhb systems are expected as the results of galaxy mergers , but few compelling candidates have survived scrutiny .",
    "furthermore , the so - called `` final parsec problem '' @xcite is not currently understood .",
    "in particular , dynamical friction with the stellar background is ineffective in shrinking the binary below separations smaller than 1 pc where gravitational radiation can complete the coalescence of the two black holes within a hubble time . after the bl09 publication ,",
    "sdss j1536 + 0441 was target of several observations with the aim to confirm or dispute the bhb scenario .",
    "* hereafter wl09 ) used the vla to image the quasar at 8.5 ghz and detected two radio emitting components separated by 0.97@xmath10 ( 5.1 kpc ) km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and @xmath11 . ] .",
    "this suggests the possibility that sdss j1536 + 0441 is not a bhb system separated by @xmath7 pc but a double quasar separated by @xmath12 kpc and probably residing in a moderately rich cluster of galaxies .",
    "high resolution ground based and hst observations @xcite indeed detected an optical counterpart to the secondary radio component but were not conclusive on the nature of the optical counterpart itself ( obscured agn or elliptical galaxy ) and on its relation with the peculiar optical spectrum .",
    "the scenario of a superposition of two agns was dismissed by @xcite and @xcite on the basis that the regions responsible for the two sets of broad lines are spatially coincident , even if some doubts remain given that this result is based on observations carried out with a seeing larger than the angular separation of the two objects along the slit @xcite .",
    "a third possible explanation was raised by @xcite .",
    "based on palomar and keck optical spectra they conclude that sdss j1536 + 0441 is an unusual member of the class of agns known as double - peaked emitters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same interpretation was given independently by @xcite .",
    "the main problem with this interpretation is that there are striking differences between the balmer - line profile in sdss j1536 + 0441 and all the other double - peaked emitters @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite argued that sdss j1536 + 0441 could be both a double - peaked emitter and a bhb system .",
    "all these possible scenarios , together with the ejected black hole hypothesis , were critically discussed in @xcite .",
    "no matter what is the real explanation for the observed properties of sdss j1536 + 0441 , what we can surely say is that this is a puzzling and possibly unique object .    in this letter , we present for the first time high - resolution ( @xmath13 mas corresponding to @xmath14 pc ) images of the 5 ghz continuum radio emission of sdss j1536 + 0441 , obtained with the european vlbi network ( evn ) . these data detect pc - scale radio cores both in sdss j1536 + 0441 and in the companion at @xmath15 east of the quasar proving the presence of two agns in this region .",
    "the european vlbi network ( evn ) was used to observe sdss j1536 + 0441 at 5 ghz on 2009 october 23 .",
    "the observations were carried at 1024 mbit s@xmath3 sustained bit rate to exploit the large bandwidth capabilities of the evn , with an array which included all the evn antennas .",
    "the pointing position was centered on the vla - a component detected by wl09 .",
    "observations were phase - referenced to the calibrator j1539 + 0430 with a duty cicle of 5 minutes . the total time on source for sdss j1536",
    "+ 0441 was about 5 hours .",
    "the strong and compact sources j1613 + 3412 and j0154 + 4743 were used as fringe finders and bandpass calibrators .",
    "the data were correlated and calibrated at the jive correlator .",
    "standard a priori gain calibration was performed using the measured gains and system temperatures of each antenna .",
    "the amplitude calibration was refined using the phase reference source .",
    "further data inspection , flagging and imaging were performed by the authors using the nrao aips software .",
    "no polarization or self - calibrations were performed .",
    "the @xmath16 r.m.s .",
    "noise in the final images is about 15 @xmath17jy .",
    "figure 1 shows the field of sdss j1536 + 0441 imaged with the evn at 5 ghz using natural weighting , which resulted in a beam of @xmath18 mas in position angle @xmath19 and a @xmath16 r.m.s noise of 15 @xmath17jy beam@xmath3 .",
    "both radio sources , vla - a and vla - b following the notation used by wl09 , are clearly detected with signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) of 50 and 15 , respectively .",
    "contour plots of vla - a and vla - b are shown in fig .",
    "we also imaged the two radio sources with a slightly better resolution ( @xmath20 mas ) but worse sensitivity , using a different _ u - v _ data weighting function .",
    "these images are not shown here but both set of images were used to find consistent fitted gaussian parameters for vla - a and vla - b .",
    "the sources were fitted with two - dimensional elliptical gaussians .",
    "the flux densities , positions and errors are : for vla - a , @xmath21 mjy , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 mas ; for vla - b , @xmath25 mjy , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath24 mas .",
    "vla - a appears slightly resolved when fitted with a single elliptical gaussian component",
    ". the deconvolved fitted sizes are @xmath28 mas with an estimated error of @xmath29 mas .",
    "the high snr for this component provides a high level of confidence for the deconvolved fitted size .",
    "there is some indication that also vla - b could be slightly resolved with deconvolved size of about @xmath30 mas , but in this case given the limited snr this value should be considered as an upper limit .",
    "the positions are in excellent agreement with those determined by wl09 . the separation between the two components is confirmed to be @xmath15 .",
    "one of the goals of the proposed evn observations was to determine the origin of the radio emission in vla - b and in particular if it could be associated with vla - a , e.g. as being a compact jet / hot - spot or a mini - lobe ejected by vla - a .",
    "no extended emission is detected in the region between the two compact radio sources . given the compactness of vla - b on the pc - scale we can now confirm without any doubt that vla - a and vla - b are two compact agns and we can rule out the possibility that the two radio sources are both powered by a 0.1 pc binary ( see wl09 ) .    comparing our flux densities at 5 ghz with those obtained by wl09",
    "we can derive an estimate of the radio spectral index between these two frequencies .",
    "it certainly can be speculative to draw conclusions on the radio spectral index of vla - a and vla - b based on observations made at different resolutions and epochs but it is a first step , waiting for more appropriate observations , and it is illustrative of the general trend of the spectral properties . as far as radio variability is concerned , the vla 8.5 ghz and the vlbi 5 ghz observations are separated by 8 months and significant variability ( e.g. @xmath31 with a few cases with larger variations ) is observed on such time range in radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars @xcite . keeping in mind this limitation ,",
    "it is worth noting that the flux density of vla - a at 5 ghz , 0.72 mjy , is lower than the 1.17 mjy measured at 8.5 ghz , while the flux density of vla - b is rather constant : 0.27 mjy at 8.5 ghz compared with 0.24 mjy at 5 ghz .",
    "both sources would have flat or inverted radio spectra , and vla - a in particular would exhibit a strongly rising radio spectrum . wl09 already suggested that vla - a could have an inverted radio spectrum to explain the non detection of the radio source in the 1.4 ghz first sky survey @xcite and our 5 ghz observations confirm this possibility .",
    "another possibility is that we are missing flux in the 5 ghz vlbi observations .",
    "if there is some extended emission ( on the scale of @xmath32 mas ) our vlbi observations might not be deep enough or have the adequate _ u - v _ coverage to detect it .",
    "this possibility is rather improbable since a significant amount of extended , and therefore steep spectrum emission at 5 ghz , should have been detected in the 1.4 ghz first survey given the 1 mjy threshold of the vla survey .",
    "therefore , in the remaining discussion we will assume that any missing flux is not significantly affecting the derived spectral indices .    with the measured flux densities at 5 and 8.5 ghz , vla",
    "- a would have a spectral index @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 ) .",
    "such an inverted spectrum , even if found in a few radio quiet quasars , is quite unusual @xcite .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption is the most invoked cause to explain the flat or inverted spectra in radio - loud or radio - quiet agns . for self - absorption to occur",
    ", the brightness temperature must be comparable to the kinetic temperature of the synchrotron electrons .",
    "the brightness temperature in kelvin is ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath35    which for vla - a gives @xmath36 k and for vla - b @xmath37 k ( assuming un upper limit for the size of vla - b of @xmath38 mas ) .",
    "these brightness temperatures , at least for vla - a for which we have a measured fitted size , are too low to affect the spectra unless the magnetic fields are unrealistically high @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart of vla - b is very red @xcite and with the detection of a pc - scale flat spectrum radio core with observed radio luminosity @xmath39 at 5 ghz of @xmath40 erg s@xmath3 is best interpreted as an obscured agn rather than an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the brightness temperature of vla - b is only a lower limit since the size is not constrained and we can not rule out the possibility of synchrotron self - absorption affecting the flat radio spectrum as well as the contribution of thermal free - free absorption / emission .    the low brightness temperature of vla - a rules out synchrotron self - absorption as the origin of the inverted radio spectrum .",
    "free - free absorption should be discarded as well , since the view to the agn is unobscured in vla - a where we see optical continuum emission from the agn and the broad - line region .",
    "we suggest that the radio emission from vla - a could be interpreted as thermal free - free emission from a disk wind @xcite .",
    "the disk wind is heated by the x - ray continuum and therefore we can expect a link between the radio and x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite found a linear correlation between radio ( @xmath41 at 5 ghz ) and x - ray ( @xmath42 ) core luminosities in an optically selected sample of nearby seyfert .",
    "this result was confirmed and extended to radio - quiet quasars by @xcite using the carefully selected and almost complete palomar - green quasar sample .",
    "they found that @xmath43 where @xmath41 is the radio luminosity at 5 ghz and @xmath42 is the bolometric 0.2 - 20 kev x - ray luminosity .",
    "quite remarkably , the same correlation , known as gdel - benz relation @xcite , holds for coronally active stars , therefore covering a range of about 15 orders of magnitude in luminosity . wl09 used the x - ray luminosity measured by _ swift _",
    "@xcite and extrapolated the 5 ghz luminosity from their 8.5 ghz measurement assuming a radio spectral index @xmath44 , obtaining @xmath45 . having a direct measure of the core flux density at 5 ghz we can refine this measurement .",
    "the observed monochromatic luminosity at 5 ghz of vla - a is @xmath46 erg s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 , and the radio luminosity at 5 ghz is @xmath47 erg s@xmath3 which gives @xmath48 , assuming all the x - ray emission is associated to vla - a .",
    "these vlbi observations were not meant to solve the so - far unsatisfactory interpretation of the puzzling properties of sdss j1536 + 0441 .",
    "the debate is still open about all the possible scenarios summarised in the introduction .",
    "what is now clear is that both vla - a and vla - b are powered by their own agn , and this should be taken into account in future analysis .",
    "further radio observations are necessary to confirm the spectral shape of the radio cores and therefore the origin of the radio emission .",
    "we have presented the first vlbi pc - scale imaging of the candidate binary black hole system sdss j1536 + 0441 observed by the european vlbi network at 5 ghz .",
    "both the vla - a component , associated with sdss j1536 + 0441 , and the companion object , vla - b , at @xmath49 east of the quasar are detected with high snr ( 50 and 15 respectively ) .",
    "the two radio nuclei appears barely resolved and no extended larger scale emission is detected .",
    "the main results can be summarised as follow :    * we detect a flat spectrum pc - scale radio nucleus at the position of vla - b confirming that both vla - a and vla - b are powered by their own agn .",
    "given the radio and optical properties , vla - b is most likely associated to an obscured agn rather than a passive elliptical galaxy .",
    "* at the position of vla - a we detect a slightly resolved radio nucleus with a strongly rising spectrum with @xmath33 between 5 and 8.5 ghz .",
    "we rule out synchroron self - absorption as the cause of the inverted radio spectrum because the derived brightness temperature of vla - a is too low .",
    "we suggest that thermal free - free emission from a disk wind provides the simplest explanation for the inverted radio spectrum in vla - a . *",
    "we derive a value of @xmath48 for vla - a that is totally consistent with correlation found for radio - quiet quasars and seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
