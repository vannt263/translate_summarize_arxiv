    "the previously known spin splitting terms , fail to reproduce the data on more than several counts.it is easy to experimentally prove , using the setup in @xcite , that @xmath43 is responsible for the spin splitting is easy : one would measure the internal magnetic field due to bia on the x or y direction . in this case",

    "_ measure through farraday rotation ( fr ) a nonzero uniform magnetization @xmath133 induced by driving an electric current ( electric field ) through the sample e of their previous experiment @xcite .",
    "it has been long predicted @xcite that semiconductors with spin - orbit coupling will exhibit a uniform magnetization when placed in an electric field generating a charge current .",
    "this can be trivially understood by a simple argument : writing the spin - orbit hamiltonian as a @xmath50 dependent magnetic field zeeman coupled to spin , @xmath134 , the application of an electric field @xmath131 will make the average value of the momentum be non - zero @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the momentum relaxation time .",
    "this creates a non - zero average @xmath137 which orients the spins along its direction through the zeeman - like coupling of the spin - orbit term .",
    "we now try to numerically estimate the value of the uniform magnetization @xmath133 using the bia - type @xmath43 . from @xcite , the bia contribution to the uniform magnetization",
    "can be obtained as @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",
    "we will now try to estimate this from first principles using @xmath43 as the main bia term and using the value of @xmath103 for sample @xmath25 deduced in table[[straintable ] ] .",
    "a simple linear response calculation of the magnetization @xmath140 to the electric current @xmath141 ( due to the applied electric field @xmath142 ) gives : @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the components of the internal magnetic field for @xmath43 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 is the fermi function of the spin - split energies @xmath148 for @xmath43 . for the hamiltonian @xmath43 , considering @xmath149 we obtain for : @xmath150",
    "as previously pointed out the magnetization is parallel to the electric field for @xmath151 or @xmath152 .",
    "this provides an important and easy check of the above assumption that the observed strain spin splitting comes from @xmath43 .",

    "the theoretical value obtained is within the experiment s error margins .     thus making its detection practical with a beam slightly more focused than in @xcite .",
    "the uniform magnetization and the spin current spin accumulatio are @xmath158 out of phase .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +    finally , using the current setup in @xcite we propose an experiment to test the prediction of dissipationless spin current . for spin 1/2 two - dimensional systems ,",
    "the initial prediction @xcite is subject to some sort of controversy , @xcite as the introduction of impurities apparently makes the spin current vanish .",
    "we here adopt the alternative view and propose a clear - cut experiment which can see the spin accumulation due to the spin current .",
    "similar to the 2d case , in the present case , the application of an electric field @xmath142 to a semiconductor with spin orbit coupling will create a spin current @xmath159 flowing perpendicular to the electric field and polarized perpendicular to both the field and the direction of flow .",
    "using linear response , the expression for the spin conductance is : @xmath160 where @xmath161 , @xmath162 is the totally antisymmetric tensor in 3 dimensions and @xmath145 are the components of the internal magnetic field . for @xmath43 and for @xmath163",
    "the only non - zero components of the spin conductance are : @xmath164 where @xmath165 are the polar angles of @xmath166 and where @xmath167 are the fermi momenta of the two bands .",
    "when both bands are occupied ( positive fermi energy ) , we find @xmath168 . usually the spin splitting is much smaller than the fermi energy , and we can define an average fermi momentum @xmath169 , @xmath170 being the dopant density . with this , we find that the spin - conductivity will be independent of the value of the strain : @xmath171 the result for the spin conductance is intermediate between the 2d spin 1/2 spin current and the 3d spin 3/2 spin current . similar to @xcite but unlike @xcite the spin conductance depends on the fermi momentum , a characteristic of the 3d . unlike @xcite , but similar to @xcite , the spin conductance does not depend on the strength of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "even though the spin conductance does not depend on the value of strain , it is essential that spin - orbit splitting ( due to strain in this case ) be present . upon the application of an electric field on the @xmath10 axis",
    ", a spin current will flow on the @xmath11 axis spin polarized in the @xmath15 direction .",
    "for @xmath172 , and a field @xmath139 we estimate a spin current @xmath173 where @xmath22 is a bohr magneton . since spin conductivity varies as @xmath174 and charge conductivity varies as @xmath170 , for low values of @xmath170 the spin conductance will overtake the charge conductance and the spin current will be larger than the charge current caused by the electric field .",
    "the density at which this happens is @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the mobility in the sample , or @xmath177 for a sample of mobility @xmath178 .",
    "the flow will result in accumulation on the opposite @xmath179 faces of the crystal ( see fig[[spincurr ] ] ) .",
    "for the present experiment , we estimate this spin accumulation of the order of @xmath180 . due to the extremely spin life time of above @xmath181 ,",
    "the distance from the edge of the sample , the spin diffusion length is very large , of the order @xmath182 .",
    "the fr beam used in @xcite has a resolution of @xmath183 on the x and y axis respectively , but focusing the beam within @xmath184 is possible @xcite .",
    "then , if the spin current prediction is right , applying the fr beam on the edge of the sample should give a clear signal ( larger than the uniform magnetization in the bulk ) .",
    "since the uniform magnetization and the spin accumulation due to spin hall current are perpendicular to each other , in time - resolved fr experiments , the spin current spin accumulation and the uniform magnetization are out of phase by @xmath158 ( see fig[[spincurr ] )    in conclusion , we have analyzed two very recent experiments @xcite and proved that conventional spin splitting terms and strain spin splitting terms do not explain the data .",
    "we have introduced a previously largely unknown term and made the case as to why it explains the observed features in @xcite .",
    "we have proposed further simple experiments to verify our assertions .",
    "if true , our proposal gives rise to the clear possibility of obtaining a uniform magnetization parallel to the applied electric field , as opposed to the one perpendicular to it that has been observed so far .",
    "along with predicting a 3d spin current , we have also proposed a way to test the spin currents in spin 1/2 systems .",

    "<S> we present a theory for two recent experiments in bulk strained semiconductors @xcite and show that a new , previously overlooked , strain spin - orbit coupling term may play a fundamental role . </S>",
    "<S> we propose simple experiments that could clarify the origin of strain - induced spin - orbit coupling terms in inversion asymmetric semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that a uniform magnetization parallel to the electric field will be induced in the samples studied in @xcite for specific directions of the applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose special geometries to detect spin currents in strained semiconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> 10000    spin manipulation in semiconductors has seen remarkable theoretical and experimental interest in recent years with the advent of spin - electronics and with the realization that strong spin - orbit coupling in certain materials can influence the transport of carriers in so - called spintronics devices @xcite . in particular , the issue of creating spin polarization of carriers in nonmagnetic semiconductors with spin - orbit coupling using only electric fields has caused a flurry of theoretical and experimental activity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two kinds of theories of spin - polarization under the action of an electric field have been put forward . </S>",
    "<S> the first kind , dating back since the mid 1980 s @xcite , predicts the existence of a spatially homogeneous net spin polarization perpendicular to the applied electric current in two dimensional samples with spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is dissipative and has been recently observed experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there also exist two very recent @xcite theories predicting non - dissipative , intrinsic spin currents with the spin polarization and flow direction perpendicular to each other and to the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> this effect does not create a bulk magnetization but , if observed , can be used for spin injection , and its validity is being experimentally tested at the present time . </S>",
    "<S> one of the theories @xcite predicts a spin current polarized out of plane and flowing perpendicular to the in - plane electric field applied on a @xmath0-dimensional semiconductor sample exhibiting rashba spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the rashba spin splitting is large enough , the spin conductivity is universal ( @xmath1 ) in the sense that it does not depend on the value of the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the other effect @xcite appears in the valence band of the bulk samples and is proportional to the spin - orbit splitting of the valence bands ( to the difference between the fermi momenta of the heavy and light - hole bands ) .    in the first part of this letter we analyze the theory behind two recent experiments in bulk strained semiconductors @xcite where an electric - field - induced uniform homogeneous spin polarization upon an applied electric field is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we make the case that the observed spin - splitting ( whose origin is puzzling ) and spin polarization is due to a previously overlooked strain - spin - splitting term , and propose easy experimental checks of our theory .    in the second part of this letter </S>",
    "<S> we predict the appearance of an intrinsic spin polarized spin current in n - doped bulk ( and 2 dimensional ) strained semiconductors ( gaas , gasb , insb , ingaas , algaas , etc ) under the influence of an electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the spin conductance is universal , in the sense that it does not depend on the value of strain ( for large enough strain ) , but it is proportional to the average fermi momentum of the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is due to the spin - orbit splitting of the conduction band under strain and is hence absent in strain - free semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the very long spin relaxation time in the conduction band as well as the relative penetration of strain engineering in semiconductor industry applications make this effect of potential technological importance . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an experimental technique using the already existing setup in @xcite to measure the spin current and to differentiate between the intrinsic spin current and the uniform magnetization effects .    in @xcite nine samples of n - doped ( @xmath2 ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) of thicknesses between @xmath5 , grown in the @xmath6 $ ] direction on undoped gaas substrate , are used to probe the electron spin dynamics through time and spatially resolved faraday rotation ( fr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the length and width of the samples are roughly @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice mismatch provides for diagonal strain in the @xmath8 , [ 010 ] , [ 001]$ ] directions of @xmath9 @xcite ( contrary to claims in @xcite , the lattice constants in @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions are also strained , this being a generic feature of @xmath6 $ ] growth ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , anisotropic shear strain develops in all directions ( @xmath12 , [ 101 ] , [ 011]$ ] ) due to different direction - dependent strain relaxation rates at the growth temperature of around @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this guarantees that all the components of the strain tensor @xmath14 are non - zero and of the same order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the strain components is given in table[1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> pump - probe fr beams measure the total magnetization of the optically injected electron spins in the growth direction @xmath15 when the samples are placed in an electric field on the @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] directions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the spin packet is mainly described by a precession around a _ </S>",
    "<S> total _ magnetic field @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an externally applied magnetic field whereas @xmath20 is the momentum - dependent internal magnetic field caused by the spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the precession around a @xmath20 is the main feature of most of the spintronics devices , starting with the das - datta spin - field transistor @xcite . under an applied electric field , </S>",
    "<S> the average particle momentum acquires a non - zero value , parallel to the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the internal magnetic field is caused by the spin orbit coupling : the electric field acts on the particle momentum which in turn couples to the spin . </S>",
    "<S> the signal at the probe beam can be fitted to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bohr magneton , @xmath23 is the electron @xmath23-factor while @xmath24 is the temporal delay between the pump and probe pulses . </S>",
    "<S> this fit gives the direction and value of @xmath20 which turns out to be perpendicular to the applied electric field @xmath25 and the @xmath26 axis ( for @xmath25 in - plane ) ; the value of @xmath20 is used to determine the spin splitting @xmath27 and a phenomenological relation @xmath28 is observed where @xmath29 is the spin - drift velocity and @xmath30 is a constant of proportionality that is the focus of the experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experiments find that @xmath29 is linearly proportional to the electric field @xmath25 .    as a first step , let us theoretically address the question of origin of @xmath30 . by group theory , </S>",

    "<S> the difference between @xmath45 and @xmath43 is that the latter has a finite @xmath20 when @xmath53 whereas the former has zero @xmath40 for the same directions .    in @xcite the values of the splitting @xmath30 </S>",

    "<S> surprisingly , the spin splitting is more of a bia - type rather than an sia - type , contradicting the conventional knowledge that an sia - type term described by @xmath39 is responsible for spin splitting in strained semiconductors @xcite .    theoretically , the dresselhaus term @xmath45 is a bulk - inversion asymmetry term that appears even in the absence of strain . as observed in the experiment , </S>",

    "<S> the energy splitting dispersion switches from @xmath64 in the unstrained case to @xmath46 when strain ( stress ) above @xmath65 is applied , in accordance to @xmath39 becoming dominant over @xmath45 . </S>",
