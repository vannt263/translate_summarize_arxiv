    "following the recipe of @xcite , we calculate energy - resolved lightcurves for a weak pulsar .",
    "we also confirm the recipe @xcite by a full ae simulation .",
    "the calculation uses no adjustable parameters and , although at inadequate numerical resolution , yields the lightcurves similar to what is observed by the fermi telescope @xcite : compare fig.([curves1 ] ) and fig.([curves2 ] ) to the observed lightcurves of the pulsars listed in table i of @xcite .",
    "a better code ( or just the same code with an increased resolution ) should allow to measure both the observation angle and the spin - dipole angle for all observed weak pulsars by the lightcurve fitting .    in  [ lightcuves ]",
    "we describe the calculation and results . in  [ recipe ]",
    "we confirm the recipe .",
    "we repeat the calculation of @xcite in three dimensions , using a three - dimensional version of the same ( most primitive ) code to solve maxwell equations .",
    "the only differences are : ( i ) the rotating permanent ( bulk ) stellar current , ( ii ) the curvature of the charge trajectory , ( iii ) the calculation of the lightcurve .",
    "we address these in turn .",
    "\\(i ) the external current is flowing toroidally around the axis @xmath0 .",
    "the axis @xmath0 is inclined relative to the angular velocity of the star @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the spin - dipole angle . the current axis @xmath0 rotates with the angular velocity @xmath1 .",
    "another parameter of a pulsar is the observation angle @xmath4 : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the direction to the observer .",
    "\\(ii ) the curvature , @xmath7 , of the trajectory of a charge moving with the unit velocity @xmath8 is given by the acceleration : @xmath9 . since @xmath10 is just an algebraic function of the local electromagnetic field , and the saturated electromagnetic field corotates with the star ( while individual charges , of course , corotate only in the corotation zone ) , the velocity field @xmath11 corotates too , i.e. , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the corotation velocity at the point with the radius vector @xmath14 .",
    "thus the curvature is given by k=|(*v*-*v*)+**| .    ;",
    "spin - dipole angle @xmath15 .",
    "the labels indicate the photon energy intervals in arbitrary units and the fraction of power in these energy intervals .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    \\(iii ) the emission is very narrowly beamed along @xmath11 and @xmath11 corotates .",
    "it follows that one can calculate the observed time - dependent luminosity by integrating the radiation power ( at fixed time ) over @xmath16 and sending each emitted photon into @xmath4 , with @xmath17 , and also assigning to each emitted photon a phase shift @xmath18 .",
    "the phase @xmath18 consists of a time delay from the emission point to the observer , plus a time delay needed for the emitting point to rotate into a position at which it will illuminate the observer . to calculate @xmath18 , put @xmath19 , and place the observer into the @xmath20-plane .",
    "then @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "one can then represent the entire family of lightcurves seen by different observers by @xmath25  the luminosity ( bolometric or energy - resolved ) observed at @xmath4 at a phase @xmath18 @xcite . in the plots , we follow the observers convention and call @xmath26 a phase .    with 270@xmath27 grid ,",
    "we place a star of radius @xmath28 at the center of a 6x6x6 box with outgoing boundary conditions .",
    "based on what we have learned from the axisymmetric calculation @xcite : the star is too big , the box is too small , the resolution is too low .",
    "even though the results seem to make sense , we must state again that our accuracy should be poor .",
    "fig.([bol ] ) shows bolometric @xmath25 for a pulsar with the spin - dipole angle @xmath15 .",
    "fig.([highe ] ) shows the high - energy @xmath25 and fig.([lowe ] ) shows the low - energy @xmath25 for the same pulsar .",

    "the particle densities are then deduced from the known electromagnetic field ( at least everywhere in the radiation zone ) . knowing the particle densities in the radiation zone , one calculates the emission .    that this procedure should give correct densities of charges for a weak pulsar is not at all obvious .",
    "the arguments of @xcite are too elaborate to be fully trustworthy .",
    "also , for non - weak pulsars , a full ae simulation , with explicit treatment of positrons and electrons seems to be a must .",
    "we therefore ran a three - dimensional full ae simulation , which describes electrons and positrons by their number density fields .",
    "the full ae simulation runs slower , so we limited ourselves by a 100@xmath27 resolution , big star ( @xmath36 ) and small box ( the light cylinder of diameter 2 barely fits into the side 3.3 box ) .",
    "now the resolution is totally inadequate .",
    "the radiation zone sits on the surface of our too big star .",
    "the influence of the box walls ( which are obviously not perfectly outgoing ) is too strong . because of all these issues",
    ", we deliberately avoid any discussion of the most interesting part of the force - free zone , where , according to @xcite , outgoing positrons should travel through a cloud of suspended electrons .",
    "( we do not even check our results there , plotting the charge density of the recipe run and the particle densities of the full ae run only down to 1/20 of the corresponding maximal values . )",
    "however , we know ( from calculating the radiation in this work and especially in @xcite ) that emission is heavily dominated by the region of enhanced positron density , shown in red in figs.([den1 ] , [ den2 ] ) . and , at least in this region of high positron density , the full ae run does confirm the recipe @xcite calculation .",
    "we then tentatively conclude that the recipe results are either exact or close to exact .",
    "if we did not make a major error in numerics , and if better codes and higher resolution simulations do not discover new effects :    * ae fully solves the weak pulsar problem . * a simplified version of ae , the recipe @xcite , is either exact or close to exact for weak pulsars .",
    "* one can measure the spin - dipole and observation angles of a weak pulsar . * to solve the non - weak pulsar problem , one needs to include pair production near the light cylinder .",
    "this might be doable .",
    "( along the following lines : ( i ) use full ae to calculate electron and positron density , ( ii ) keep track of gamma - ray photons emitted by the curvature radiation , ( iii ) keep track of x - ray photons emitted by the synchrotron radiation of newly born pairs and/or emitted by the star , ( iv ) add pairs and remove photons due to the x - ray - gamma - ray collisions . )"
