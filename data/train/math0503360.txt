    "however , there are other examples ; in fact the main topic of this paper is to understand to what extent these two notions coincide .    as a small example consider the 1-factorization of  @xmath12 ( see figure  [ fig : k4 ] ) .",
    "this constitutes a cut - continuous mapping @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "an inclusion @xmath14 is a homomorphism , hence induces a cut - continuous mapping .",
    "however , this example is an isolated one , as in corollary  [ homotens ] we show that there are no other cut - continuous equivalent complete graphs .",
    "@xmath15    several other examples demonstrate that the existence of cut - continuous mapping is not a very restrictive relation .",
    "for example the well - known graphs depicted in figure  [ fig : examples ] ( on page  ) are all equivalent with respect to cut - continuous mapping ( see theorem  [ examples ] ) .",
    "another set of examples of cut - continuous mappings we get by considering a pair of trees and any mapping between their edge sets .",
    "this may indicate that the cut - continuous mappings are abundant and induce a very weak graph comparison .",
    "indeed , we give some further examples of pairs of graphs that can not be distinguished by cut - continuous mappings ( although they are not equivalent with respect to homomorphisms ) . however , despite of all this evidence we prove that such examples are rare , in the sense of random graphs .",

[ wbe ] a random graph is homotens with probability @xmath17 ( as size of the graph grows to infinity ) .",
    "this result suggests to follow the now - standard approach to homomorphisms ( see e.g.  @xcite ) to investigate cut - continuous mappings in the context of corresponding quasiorder  @xmath18 and strict partial order  @xmath19 .",

    "let us remark that special cases of cut - continuous mappings were ( implicitly ) studied earlier :    * whitney classical theorem ( @xcite , @xcite ) can be restated in our language : for 3-connected graphs @xmath7  and @xmath5 , any bijection @xmath30 such that both @xmath11  and @xmath31 are cut - continuous is induced by an isomorphism .",

    "we orient the edges of  @xmath7 arbitrarily .",

    "we can choose @xmath16 more carefully , namely we can let @xmath837 where @xmath112 is a large enough prime ( so that @xmath838 ) . in this way , we obtain an infinite antichain of order @xmath238 that consists of graphs with circular chromatic number bounded by @xmath839 .",
    "we restrict our attention to @xmath74 and @xmath823 , which seem to be the two most important cases . as shown by theorem  [ largeexamples ]",
    "there are pairs of arbitrary highly connected graphs @xmath7 ,",

    "on the contrary , corollary  [ homotens ] shows that for almost all graphs @xmath834 and @xmath83 coincide . it would be interesting to know , whether @xmath834 and @xmath83 coincide for random regular graphs , or for sparse random graphs .",
    "for @xmath643 the situation is rather different .",

    "this is @xmath643 , but ( except for @xmath186 of them ) is not induced by a homomorphism .",
