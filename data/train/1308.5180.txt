    "a central theme of complex dynamics is that of linearization , that is , conjugating a mapping near a fixed point to a simpler mapping .",
    "the idea is that it is then easier to see how the mapping behaves near the fixed point .",
    "for example , if @xmath2 is a polynomial in @xmath3 with a repelling fixed point @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 and @xmath6 , then there exists an entire function @xmath7 which satisfies @xmath8 and @xmath9 for all @xmath10 .",
    "hence up to conjugation @xmath2 behaves like a @xmath3-linear mapping near @xmath4 , see for example @xcite .",

    "the functional equation may be iterated to obtain @xmath11 for any @xmath12 .",
    "this indicates that the linearizer @xmath7 depends on the dynamical properties of @xmath2 as well as @xmath4 and @xmath13 .     about @xmath14 ( to @xmath15 decimal places ) .",
    "the fast escaping set is a spider s web.,width=480 ]    the dynamics of such linearizers , and in particular the fast escaping set , were studied in @xcite by mihaljevic - brandt and peter .",
    "they showed that if @xmath16 is not in the mandelbrot set , then a linearizer about a fixed point of @xmath17 has a spider s web structure for its fast escaping set , see for example figure [ pic1 ] which was produced by doug macclure .",
    "we briefly recall the notion of the fast escaping set here . recall that the escaping set of a holomorphic function is defined by @xmath18 and was first studied by eremenko @xcite for transcendental entire functions , and the fast escaping set is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the maximum modulus and @xmath21 denotes the iterated maximum modulus , e.g. @xmath22 .",
    "the fast escaping set was introduced by bergweiler and hinkkanen @xcite and has been extensively studied , see for example @xcite .",
    "quasiregular mappings are a natural higher dimensional analogue of holomorphic functions in the plane , and so the iteration of quasiregular mappings is a natural higher dimensional counterpart to complex dynamics .",
    "an important point here is that quasiregular mappings satisfy analogues of picard s theorem and montel s theorem , both key results for complex dynamics .",

    "there is not a surfeit of examples of quasiregular mappings with interesting dynamics , and so an aim of this paper is to bring attention to this class of quasiregular mappings and its dynamics .",
    "we will first construct the analogue of poincar functions in the quasiregular setting . recalling how poincar linearizers arise from repelling fixed points of polynomials , the natural analogue of polynomials to this situation are uniformly quasiregular mappings ( abbreviated to uqr ) .",

    "all currently known examples extend to quasiregular mappings @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "these were the first quasiregular mappings whose dynamics were studied @xcite .    for such mappings which are not injective ,",
    "there are direct analogues of the fatou and julia sets and @xmath29 .",
