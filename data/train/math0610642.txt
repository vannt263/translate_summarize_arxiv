    "the numerical solution of partial differential equations on unbounded domains arises in a large variety of applications in science and engineering .",
    "a typical example we concern in this paper is the nonlinear schrdinger - type equations in multi - dimensional space , which describe the gravity waves on deep water in fluid dynamics , the pulse propagations in optics fibers , and bose - einstein condensations in very low temperature ; see sulem and sulem @xcite and agrawal @xcite for details .",
    "one principal difficulty to obtain numerical solutions of these problems is the unboundedness of the physical domain . in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "the artificial boundary method @xcite has been widely studied in recent decades , with which the original problem is reduced to an approximate ( or equivalent ) problem in a truncated computational domain .",
    "the key point of the artificial boundary method is to construct a  suitable \" artificial boundary condition on the given artificial boundary for the problem .",
    "in particular , when we consider problems containing wave propagations , we hope the artificial boundary conditions can annihilate all the incident waves so as that there is no or minor reflected waves propagating into the interior domain .",
    "these artificial boundary conditions are also known as absorbing boundary conditions . for linear problems",
    ", many strategies have been developed to obtain accurate and efficient boundary conditions , such as @xcite for hyperbolic wave equations , @xcite for elliptic equations , and @xcite for parabolic equations . in the case of the linear schrdinger equation , there are also several works @xcite developing transparent boundary conditions and studying their difference approximations and stability .",
    "they utilized the integral transform ( laplace or fourier transform ) or series expansion method to construct accurate boundary conditions which are in nonlocal forms . in practical applications",
    "the fast evaluation method @xcite must be developed to discretize the nonlocal boundary conditions .",
    "on the other hand , the authors in @xcite constructed absorbing boundary conditions by deriving polynomial approximations to nonlocal operators in transparent boundary conditions with taylor or rational expansions .",
    "this class of boundary conditions is local , and hence they are easy to implement .",
    "the treatment of the boundary conditions on the artificial boundary for nonlinear equations is difficult in general .",
    "hagstrom and keller @xcite studied some nonlinear elliptic problems by linearizing the equations .",
    "han et al .",
    "@xcite and xu et al .",
    "@xcite respectively discussed the nonlinear burgers eqquation and kardar - parisi - zhang equation .",
    "the exact nonlinear artificial conditions have been obtained by using the cole - hopf transformation . for the works related with the nonlinear schrdinger equations under consideration",
    ", zheng @xcite obtained the transparent boundary condition using the inverse scattering transform approach for the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation in one dimension .",
    "antonie et al .",
    "@xcite also studied the one - dimensional cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation and constructed several nonlinear integro - differential artificial boundary conditions . in @xcite ,",
    "szeftel designed absorbing boundary conditions for one - dimensional nonlinear wave equation by the potential and the paralinear strategies .",
    "especially , the one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation was discussed . the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) @xcite",
    "was also applied to handling the nonlinear schrdinger equations in which the nonlinear term can be general .",
    "recently , xu and han @xcite proposed a split local absorbing boundary ( slab ) method through a time - splitting procedure to design absorbing boundary conditions for one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equations .",
    "the local absorbing boundary conditions were imposed on the split linear subproblem and yielded a full scheme by coupling the discretizations for the interior equation and boundary subproblems . in using local boundary conditions for the schrdinger - type equations ,",
    "it is important to pre - estimate a wave - number parameter ( or the group velocity parameter ) of the wave function , as is illustrated in @xcite , which strongly influences the accuracy of the boundary condition . in this paper",
    ", we present an adaptive parameter selection approach based on the gabor transform @xcite to capture the wave number near the artificial boundaries in order that the constructed absorbing boundary conditions can minimize the reflected wave . in particular , for nonlinear problems , a wave packet of the nonlinear schrdinger equation will evolve into various wave packets with different wave numbers . with the gabor transform",
    ", the boundary conditions can succeed in reflecting the local structure of the frequency context of the wave .",
    "particular focus of this paper is to apply the adaptive approach to multi - dimensional problems with nonlinear terms , in which very few boundary conditions can work well .",
    "the organization of this paper is the following . in section 2 , we first give a brief overview of absorbing boundary conditions for the linear schrdinger equation , and then discuss the adaptive strategy in picking the parameter in boundary conditions .",
    "two - dimensional boundary conditions for linear problems are also proposed in this section . in section 3 , we are devoted to the two - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation and its numerical issues in both interior domain and artificial boundaries .",
    "numerical examples are investigated in section 4 .",
    "we shall give a brief overview for local absorbing boundary conditions of the linear schrdinger equation in one dimension @xmath0 set the truncated subdomain @xmath1 $ ] be the computational domain .",
    "suppose that the potential @xmath2 is constant in the exterior domain @xmath3\\cup[x_r,+\\infty)$ ] .",
    "consider the solutions of the schrdinger wave equation ( [ lse1 ] ) in the form of one fourier mode : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the wave number corresponding to space @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the time frequency .",
    "we have the dual relation between the space - time @xmath8 domain and the wave number - frequency @xmath9 domain : @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . using this duality",
    ", we can transform schrdinger wave equation ( [ lse1 ] ) into the fourier domain resulting in a dispersion relation to the equation : @xmath12    under the framework of engquist and majda approach @xcite , solving ( [ dis1 ] ) in terms of the wave number @xmath5 gives @xmath13 where the plus sign corresponds to waves moving to the positive @xmath6 direction , while the minus sign indicates wave motions in opposite direction .",
    "the exact transformation of ( [ pb1 ] ) to physical space is nonlocal in time so that one has to save all history data in memory in order to perform numerical calculations .",
    "an effective substitution is to approximate the square root through a rational polynomial .",
    "let us consider the right exterior domain and obtain boundary condition at @xmath14 ; that is , the plus sign is taken in ( [ pb1 ] ) .",
    "similar procedure can be performed in the left exterior domain . as in @xcite",
    ", we denote the absorbing boundary condition by abc@xmath15 for that using @xmath15-pad approximation , where @xmath16 are the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator , respectively .    the first absorbing boundary condition is the one developed in shibata @xcite .",
    "the author used a linear interpolation to approximate the square root in ( [ pb1 ] ) through imposing two adjustable parameters which were positive and called the kinetic energy parameters related to the group velocities of the wave function @xcite , that is , @xmath17 then using the dual relations to transform back into physical space yields an absorbing boundary condition @xmath18    kuska @xcite used a @xmath19-pad approximation to @xmath20 centered at a positive constant @xmath21 @xmath22 and then obtained a second absorbing boundary condition abc(1,1 ) , @xmath23 after transforming back into physical space through the dual transform . here",
    "the range of validity of the pad polynomial is the positive part @xmath24 .",
    "alonso - mallo and reguera @xcite developed a class of absorbing boundary conditions including abc(2,1 ) , abc(3,2 ) and abc(2,0 ) and absorbing boundary conditions discussed above .",
    "fevens and jiang @xcite developed a distinct method to construct absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "the authors used the group velocity @xmath25 to design a differential equation as absorbing boundary condition , which can absorb waves with certain group velocities @xmath26 , @xmath27    if we substitute the temporal derivative into abc(1,0 ) with the original equation @xmath28 , then we obtain @xmath29 it is a special case of fevens and jiang s formula ( [ fj ] ) with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we use the original equation again to replace the temporal derivative terms in ( [ abc1 ] ) and get @xmath32 which is also a special case of eq .",
    "( [ fj ] ) for @xmath33 and group velocities @xmath34 .      in the above absorbing boundary conditions ,",
    "the authors all imposed parameters in the formulae with different meanings .",
    "therefore , perhaps one of the most important issues is how to pick suitable parameters such that they can minimize the reflection of the wave . noticing that the relation between the group velocity @xmath35 and wave number @xmath5 is @xmath36 we need only calculate one of them .    for the initial wave composed of waves with different group velocities",
    ", they shall evolve into different wave packets .",
    "each of them has an unchanged group velocity .",
    "these wave packets hit the artificial boundary separately .",
    "therefore , in a general physical insight , if only we pre - estimate one component of group velocities which is a function of time , the boundary condition can well annihilate the reflected wave .",
    "let us consider the third - order boundary condition abc(1,1 ) given in section 2.1 as example to introduce our idea , in which only one parameter @xmath37 need to be pre - estimated .",
    "similarly , for convenience , the discussion is focused on the right boundary .",
    "we remark that we can also utilize the time windowed fourier transform to approximate temporal frequency information @xmath7 , and then obtain an estimation of the wave number @xmath37 with the dispersion relation ( [ pb1 ] ) .",
    "however , it is clear that the gabor transform in time depends on the history data on the artificial boundaries .",
    "therefore , although the formulae of absorbing boundary conditions are in local forms , they are nonlocal in practice .",
    "the formula ( [ max ] ) is also not the best choice in many practical computations . on one hand , this procedure involves many logical  if \" structures in order to compare the magnitudes of the fourier modes , which are not very efficient in calculations in some computational environments . on the other hand , when two fourier modes are both dominant , it is obvious to choose @xmath37 a medial value of two different wave numbers instead of taking one of them , in order to minimize the reflection .",
    "therefore , an improvement is to use a weighted strategy , we call it the energy - weighted wave - number parameter selection approach , as follows , @xmath43 with @xmath44 a positive real number .    we give the following remarks :    * remark 1 . * the window width @xmath41 is correlative with the gibbs phenomena induced by the discontinuities of the window function .",
    "the narrower @xmath41 is , the more gibbs effect .",
    "however , if the window width @xmath41 is very large , then the obtained parameter can not correctly response the frequency information in the vicinity of the boundary .",
    "* remark 2 .",
    "* when @xmath45 , the eq .",
    "( [ weight ] ) is equivalent to ( [ max ] ) .",
    "however , numerical experiments illustrate that the absorbing boundary conditions work best when @xmath44 is in a suitable intermediate interval",
    ". table 1 suggests @xmath46 is a good choice .",
    "let us consider the extension of previous abcs which are local for the linear schrdinger equation in two dimensions : @xmath47 with the potential @xmath48 constant .",
    "denote the dual variables to @xmath49 by @xmath50 with the correspondence @xmath51 and @xmath11 .",
    "then the related dispersion relation to eq .",
    "( [ lse ] ) gives @xmath52    we truncate the unbounded domain to get a computational domain @xmath53 ^ 2 $ ] . without loss of generality , consider the east boundary @xmath54 which corresponds to the positive branch to @xmath55 of the dispersion relation ( [ dis ] ) as follows , @xmath56 with the same procedure as that used in one dimensional case , we can get the similar abcs as in section 2.1 .",
    "we consider the @xmath57pad approximation to the square @xmath58 in the dispersion relation centered as a positive constant @xmath59 , and obtain an approximation to ( [ pb ] ) @xmath60 which is first order in @xmath55 . here",
    "the range of validity of the pad polynomial is the positive part @xmath61 ; see kuska @xcite",
    ". transforming ( [ pbap ] ) back into the physical space through the dual relations , we have an abc on the right boundary of the form : @xmath62 absorbing boundary conditions on the west , north and south boundaries can also be obtained through using @xmath63-pad approximations to @xmath58 centered at @xmath64 , to @xmath65 centered at @xmath66 , and to @xmath65 centered at @xmath67 , respectively , which are @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 with @xmath66 a positive constant as @xmath71 .",
    "now let us look at the formula at the north east corner @xmath72 .",
    "we can also approximate the two dimensional dispersion relation ( [ dis ] ) in the quarter @xmath73 using @xmath57pad to both @xmath58 and @xmath65 with the corresponding centered point @xmath74 to obtain @xmath75 then after multiplying @xmath76 in both sides , we have , @xmath77 then performing the inverse transform to physical space yields the abc(1,1 ) at the corner point , @xmath78    extension of the adaptive parameter selection for one - dimensional version to multidimensional cases is straightforward .",
    "we note that a multidimensional problem can be split into a series of one - dimensional ones .",
    "thus we can obtain the estimation of the parameters at every boundary grid points by a dimension - by - dimension procedure .",
    "for example , in order to compute the wave number on the east boundary , we have the gabor transform in @xmath6 direction : @xmath79 where the window length is a function of @xmath80 . the parameter @xmath81",
    "can then be determined by using the method in section 2.2 .",
    "we now consider the nonlinear schrdinger equation in two dimensions as follows , @xmath82 we shall extend the previous work of the split local absorbing boundary ( slab ) method @xcite in one - dimensional version to solving the two - dimensional case .",
    "denote the approximation of @xmath83 on the grid point @xmath84 by @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "let us first describe the finite difference scheme for the eq .",
    "( [ twod ] ) in the interior domain @xmath92 , which will be connected with the discretization on the artificial boundaries .      in our previous work in one dimension @xcite , the full - implicit crank - nicholson scheme , which is unconditionally stable , was used .",
    "however , one has to solve the nonlinear algebraic system iteratively at each time step .",
    "it is time consuming in particular for the two dimensional case . in order to avoid the iterative process",
    ", we use the following semi - implicit scheme @xcite , which was shown efficient and robust in comparison with various difference schemes for solving nonlinear schrdinger equations @xcite , @xmath93\\frac{\\psi_{\\iota j}^{n+1}+\\psi_{\\iota j}^n}{2 } , \\label{scheme}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 represent the forward and backward differences , respectively .",
    "this is a five - points scheme and its truncation error is order @xmath96 as that of the crank - nicholson scheme .",
    "however , since the nonlinear term is approximated by the known variables through an extrapolation formula , we need only to solve a linear algebraic system at each time step .",
    "we have obtained the discrete scheme by formula ( [ scheme ] ) in the interior point @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "now we concentrate on the boundary conditions , in which we shall perform the local time - splitting procedure .",
    "the basic idea of the slab method is to split the original equation in several subproblems which are easy to be handled , and then solve them alternatively in a small time step @xmath100 . consider a standard splitting for eq .",
    "( [ twod ] ) in the vicinity of the artificial boundary to a nonlinear subproblem @xmath101 and a linear subproblem @xmath102 we carry out the splitting on boundary points @xmath103 for @xmath104 following @xcite , in the nonlinear step , we have an approximate solver for explicitly discretizing the ode ( [ ns ] ) @xmath105 which keeps @xmath83 invariant , and does not require any boundary condition . noting the next step for the time - splitting procedure is to integrate a linear subproblem ( [ ls ] ) , we impose here the local absorbing boundary condition discussed in section 2 .",
    "for example , using formulae ( [ east ] ) , ( [ corner ] ) and their corresponding formulae on every boundaries and corners , we obtain the full scheme of the problem by approximating them with finite difference expressions . here",
    "the discrete forms of the terms in the east boundary condition ( [ east ] ) are @xmath106 with @xmath107 the backward sum , for example , @xmath108 and the discrete forms of the terms in the corner boundary condition ( [ corner ] ) are @xmath109 similar discretizations can be used for the other three boundaries and the other three corners .",
    "thus we obtain the full - discrete scheme for the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ twod ] ) in two dimensions , which yields a linear algebraic system at each time steps .",
    "* remark 3 .",
    "* near the artificial boundaries , the truncation error of accuracy is @xmath110 because we only adopt the first - order splitting . in order to improve the accuracy of time - splitting to higher order , such as using the strang splitting @xcite",
    ", we will obtain a nonlinear algebraic system which have to be solved through the iterate approach as discussed in ref .",
    "we test our absorbing boundary conditions given in the previous sections for the nonlinear schrdinger equation . in particular , we test the strategy of adaptive parameter selection in the one - dimensional case . based on its outstanding performance in one dimension , two - dimensional example of extensions is also given .",
    "* example 1 .",
    "* we are going to test the performance of the adaptive parameter selection for absorbing boundary conditions by solving the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation in one dimension @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a real constant and @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath112 is positive , the equation represents repulsive interactions .",
    "if @xmath112 is negative , the equation represents attractive interactions , and admits bright soliton solution @xmath114 with @xmath115 real parameters related to the amplitude and velocity of the soliton .",
    "the numerical scheme is the 1d reduction of 2d version described in section 3 .",
    "the first example we consider the case of @xmath116 and the initial condition @xmath117 it represents two solitons with amplitude 1 , located at two isolated centers @xmath118 and 30 respectively , propagate to the right .",
    "their propagating velocities are double of their wave numbers ; that is , 4 and 10 , respectively .",
    "we compute the solution up to @xmath119 in interval @xmath120 $ ] for @xmath121 . as in @xcite , to see the influence of parameter @xmath37 , we evaluate the effectiveness of absorbing boundary conditions by calculating the reflection ratios as follows , @xmath122 the ratio @xmath123 is handy in the measurement of the quality of the abc . for example , @xmath124 reflects that the solitons have passed through the boundary completely ; whereas @xmath125 indicates the waves are completely reflected into the interior domain by the artificial boundaries . at the left boundary @xmath126 , we set @xmath127 since there is no left - going wave .",
    "we also hope the reflected waves from the right boundary can also be reflected by the left boundary , therefore the reflection ratios of absorbing boundary conditions at the right boundary can be correctly calculated .",
    "we show numerical results in table 1 for different @xmath44 in ( [ weight ] ) and different transforms , in which we also illustrate @xmath128-errors defined by @xmath129 here and hereafter , the time steps @xmath100 are taken to be @xmath130 .",
    "it is not the restriction of stability , but the requirement for compensating the accuracy since we just use the first - order splitting on the artificial boundaries .",
    "for the gabor transform to pre - estimate the parameter , the window lengths are set to @xmath131 .",
    "we also compare the results in table 2 without the adaptive parameter selection but fixing the parameter @xmath132 and 5 , respectively .",
    "it is observed that the weighted wave - number parameter method can well improve numerical accuracy .",
    "there are two time phases in the process for the two solitons hit the right boundary separately .",
    "the first phase is for @xmath133 $ ] when the first wave with the wave number 5 transmits the boundary ; while the second phase is for @xmath134 $ ] when the second wave with the wave number 2 passes through the boundary . in order to see the resultant wave - number parameter of the methods in discussion",
    ", we illustrate the wave numbers as a function of time @xmath38 for two phases in fig .",
    "1 , where we denote the resultant wave number with fourier transform and @xmath44 norm by f@xmath44 wave number , the results with gabor transform and @xmath44 norm by g@xmath44 wave number .",
    "we see that the parameters with gabor transform , especially when @xmath46 , response a better information for the solution , which well agrees with the results in table 1 .    in order to see the influence of the window length @xmath41",
