    "rotating matter while falling onto black holes creates a temporary depository of matter called _ accretion disc_. as matter moves closer to the black hole , at around a few tens of schwarzschild radii ( @xmath2 ) , centrifugal force tends to be comparable to the inward gravitational force and the supersonic inflow is slowed down .",
    "if this slowing down occurs in a thin region @xcite , the flow is said to suffer a _ shock _ , where the mach number jumps discontinuosly from supersonic to subsonic branch .",
    "this slowed down post - shock flow is considerably heated up and as a result , puffs up ( to maintain hydrostatic balance along z - direction ) in the form of a tori called cenbol ( centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ) .",
    "cenbol contains a copius hot electrons which inverse - comptonize the soft photons from outer cool thin disc @xcite , producing the hard - power law tail @xcite . as a lot of heat",
    "is stored in the cenbol , chakrabarti and his co - workers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) has shown that the thermal pressure along the vertical direction pushes the matter out in the form of jets . in this paper , we investigate the _ interaction _ of these _ jets _ with the high energy _ photons _ _ radiated _ by the cenbol .",
    "interaction of radiation and jets have been studied by several workers .",
    "piran ( @xcite ) showed that it is difficult to accelerate outflows from thick accretion disc beyond lorentz factor @xmath3 .",
    "icke ( @xcite ) in a very important paper showed that , if outflows are to be accelerated by radiation from ` infinite ' thin discs , the terminal speed ( ` magic speed ' in his parlance ) achieved is just @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the velocity of light .",
    "fukue ( @xcite ) , showed the terminal speed for rotating flow above thin disc , is little less than what icke had obtained .",
    "the conclusion is that radiative interaction actually limits the jet terminal speed .",
    "we improve these works by studying the interaction of a jet with radiation coming from the most general form of accretion flow , namely the _ advective discs _",
    "( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the first three moments of the radiation intensity for , the radiation energy density , radiative flux and various components of radiative pressure are being calculated following the treatment of chattopadhyay & chakrabarti ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for simplicity , we assume that the radiation originates only from the cenbol .    in the next section",
    "we show that , the terminal speed achieved by the outflowing plasma depends on the comparative value of the various moments of radiation involved .",
    "we show that the radiation from the advective flows can produce relativistic jets . in  3 , we draw our conclusions .    [",
    "we assume that the electron - positron plasma jets are non - rotating and confined along the axis of symmetry . to study only the radiation effects , we ignore the gas pressure gradient term . we confine our investigation within the realm of special relativity and the effects of strong gravity",
    "is taken care by paczyski - wiita potential ( @xcite ) .",
    "the unit of length , time , mass and velocity are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath5 respectively , where @xmath9 and @xmath8 are the gravitational constant and mass of the central black hole .",
    "the metric considered is given by , @xmath10 we assume @xmath11 and also @xmath12 .",
    "we define a 3-velocity @xmath13 , given by @xmath14 , where the latin index ( @xmath15 ) denotes space variables .",
    "the lorentz factor is given by , @xmath16 .",
    "hence in our case @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the equation of motion ( see , mihalas and mihalas @xcite and kato @xcite ) is given by , @xmath20 , \\eqno{(1)}\\ ] ] where , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the thomson scattering opacity , the z - component of radiative flux on the z - axis , energy density on the axis of symmetry , and the z - z component of pressure tensor on the axis of symmetry .",
    "the term @xmath25 is the gravity term with paczyski - wiita potential . using the expressions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 we can reduce eq .",
    "( 1 ) in terms of the 3-velocity @xmath13 , and is given by , @xmath28 } { { \\gamma}^4v } , \\eqno{(2)}\\ ] ] where , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are radiative flux , energy density and z - z component of pressure tensor which has been multiplied by @xmath21 . to find the expression for terminal speed , we put the term in the square bracket of eq .",
    "( 2 ) equal to zero and get a quadratic equation for @xmath32 , @xmath33 it is easy to show that at @xmath34large , @xmath35 , and also that all three quantities vary slowly with @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "thus for large @xmath36 , let @xmath37 , hence @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "hence , from the above quadratic equation we get , @xmath43 putting the radiation field quantities in terms of @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we have , @xmath45 equation ( 4 ) shows that @xmath32 can be very close to the velocity of light , thus radiation drag does not limit the terminal velocity to some moderately relativistic values . in case of gas flows above a thin disc ( @xcite,@xcite ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , putting those values in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we have @xmath48 ( see , icke@xcite ) .",
    "_ we have thus proved that the terminal velocity achieved depends on the radiation field produced by the structure of the disc_. if we now integrate eq .",
    "( 2 ) with a very small injection velocity , we can find the solution topologies for jets as shown in fig .",
    "2a . though there is no upper limit to @xmath32 , even then increasing the luminosity , will not increase @xmath32 drastically , as there is @xmath49 term in the rhs of the denominator of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and hence as @xmath50 , @xmath51 . in fig . 2b",
    "the velocity at @xmath52 , @xmath53 is plotted with the disc luminosity @xmath54 and is found that as one increases @xmath54 , the response of @xmath53 is not linear .",
    "figure 2b shows that it is difficult to get terminal speeds @xmath55 with radiative acceleration only , as that would require extremely high luminosity , which is difficult to produce without , at the same time , cooling the cenbol itself .",
    "[ fig : ex ]",
    "in our investigation we have assumed the entire disc luminosity is coming only from the cenbol region .",
    "it can be shown elsewhere that the contribution from the pre - cenbol thin disc will marginally affect the results shown here .",
    "we conclude that , the terminal speeds calculated previously , by using radiation fields from very specialised accretion discs ( , thin disc , thick disc , etc ) , show mildly relativistic flows , and are basically the artefacts of those disc geometries themselves .",
    "if one considers more generic disc model as we have done , the radiation drag does not introduce a mildly relativistic upper limit for terminal speed .",
    "we find that achieving terminal velocity close to that of light by radiation pressure effects is possible .",
