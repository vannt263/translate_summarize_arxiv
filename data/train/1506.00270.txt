    "general relativity ( gr ) is widely recognized as one of the keystones of modern physics .",
    "notwithstanding , it has not always been adopted to set bounds on physical parameters as it should .",
    "the pity of it is that the so - called classical tests of gr are moderately used to estimate limits on the constants that appear in relevant physical models .",
    "we remark that among the aforementioned tests there is one , namely , light bending , which has been confirmed with great accuracy in the last two decades .",
    "this prediction of gr was first verified in 1919 .",
    "two separate expeditions to sobral ( brazil ) and prince ( guinea ) , organized by eddington and dyson with the aim of observing the eclipse of may 29 , 1919 , reported deflections of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in reasonable accord with what einstein thought would happen . many measurements of the gravitational deflection were then made in succeeding years , but the accuracy did not really increase until the advent of very long baseline radio interferometry in 1972 , using quasar sources . in this vein , it is worth mentioning two measurements of the solar gravitational deflection of radio waves made using the aforementioned technique , which are in excellent agreement with the prediction of gr .",
    "the first was made by lebach _",
    "_ @xcite ; while the other is owed to fomalont , kopeikin , lanyi , and benson @xcite . from the former it was obtained a deflection parameter @xmath3 , whereas for the latter @xmath4 .",
    "incidentally , it is expected that a series of improved designed experiments with the very long baseline array could increase the accuracy of the second measurement by at least a factor of 4 @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , to the layman , light bending is one of the most impressive predictions made by einstein .",
    "his celebrated formula @xmath5 is in truth the only possible rival to the mentioned prediction in popularity .    on the other hand , higher - derivative gravity models in ( @xmath6 ) dimensions",
    "were suggested for the first time by weyl @xcite and eddington @xcite , being , roughly speaking , nothing but simple generalizations of gr obtained by enlarging einstein lagrangian via the scalars @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "an interesting discussion about these classical systems can be found in the article by havas @xcite .",
    "later on it was shown that owing to the gauss - bonnet theorem only two of the terms above mentioned had to be added to einstein lagrangian .",
    "however , only when it was proved that gr was nonrenormalizable within the standard perturbative scheme , did higher - derivative gravity ( hdg )  up until then thought as a mere extension of einstein s gravity  became indeed a prime candidate in the long and difficult search for a quantum gravity theory . in this vein , the seminal work done by stelle in 1977 @xcite  in which it was clearly shown that hdg is renormalizable along with its matter couplings",
    " is worthy of note .",
    "unfortunately , this theory is nonunitary owing to the presence of a massive spin-2 ghost . by the way , in 1986 , antoniadis and tomboulis @xcite claimed that the presence of a massive spin-2 ghost in the bare propagator is inconclusive , since this excitation is unstable .",
    "according to them , the position of the complex poles in the dressed propagator is explicitly gauge dependent . using standard arguments from quantum field theory they came to the conclusion that hdg theories are unitary .",
    "two years after antoniadis and tomboulis article , johnston @xcite proved that the conjectures of these authors were not correct since the pair of complex conjugate poles that appear in the resumed propagator are gauge independent , i.e. , they are sedentary : under a change in the gauge parameter they do not move .",
    "therefore , hdg models are nonunitary .    before going on",
    "we shall discuss the common misconception that _ singular _ higher - derivative models can be discarded by appealing to the ostrogradski theorem @xcite .",
    "for the sake of generality we consider higher - derivative systems in ( n + 1 ) dimensions , with n=2 , 3 , ... . according to popular belief",
    ", ostrogradski s result implies that there exists a linear instability in the hamiltonian associated with all higher - derivative systems .",
    "this is a completely untrue assertion .",
    "indeed , ostrogradski only treated nonsingular models @xcite .",
    "therefore , the only way of circumventing ostrogradski s non - go theorem is by considering singular models , which is in accord with the conclusion reached by woodard @xcite .",
    "an interesting example of this kind is the rigid relativistic particle studied by plyushchay @xcite .",
    "now , since in this paper we are only interested in higher - derivative gravity models , we remark that these systems are gauge invariant and , as consequence , are defined by singular lagrangians @xcite .",
    "thence , ostrogradski s theorem does not apply to them , which does not mean , of course , that they are always ghost - free models .    in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , for instance , the bht model ( `` new massive gravity '' ) , which is defined by the lagrangian    @xmath9     , \\nonumber\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being einstein s constant in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , and @xmath12(@xmath13 ) is a mass parameter , has no ghosts at the tree level @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , @xmath14 gravity in @xmath15 dimensions , i.e. , the model defined by the lagrangian @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 , with @xmath18",
    "being einstein s constant in @xmath19 dimensions , and @xmath20 is a free parameter , is also tree - level unitary @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , sotiriou and faraoni studied the so called @xmath21 theories of gravity in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions and at the classical level and came to the conclusion that `` theories of the form @xmath22 , contains , in general , a massive spin-2 ghost field in addition to the usual massless graviton and the massive scalar '' @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , at the linear level , these theories are stable @xcite .",
    "the reason why they do not explode is because the ghost can not accelerate owing to energy conservation .",
    "another way of seeing this is by analyzing the free wave solutions .",
    "we remark that these models are not in disagreement with the result found by sotiriou and faraoni . indeed , despite containing a massive spin-2 ghost , as asserted by these authors , the alluded ghost can not cause trouble .",
    "recently it was shown that at least in the cases of specific cosmological backgrounds , the unphysical massive ghost that haunts higher - derivative gravity in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions and is present in the spectrum of this theory is not growing up as a physical excitation and remains in the vacuum state until the initial frequency of the perturbation is close to the planck scale . accordingly , higher - derivative models of quantum gravity can be seen as very satisfactory effective theories of quantum gravity below the planck cut - off @xcite .    therefore , although hdg ( higher - derivative gravity in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions ) is nonunitary in the framework of the usual quantum field theory , this does not imply that it must be rejected .",
    "we finish our digression by proving that hdg systems can be utilized at the tree level as effective field models at scales far away from the planck scale .",
    "consider in this spirit the scattering at the tree level of a quantum particle by hdg .",
    "now , keeping in mind that the lagrangian for hdg can be written as    @xmath23,\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being newton s constant , and @xmath20 and @xmath26 are free dimensionless coefficients , we promplyt find that the associated propagator is given in the de donder gauge and in momentum space by @xcite    @xmath27 p^{(2 ) } + \\frac{2\\lambda}{k^2}p^{(1 ) }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & +    \\frac{1}{2}\\bigg [     \\frac{1}{k^2- m_0 ^ 2 }    -\\frac{1}{k^2 }   \\bigg ] p^{(0-s ) } \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\bigg [ \\frac{4 \\lambda}{k^2 } + \\frac{3m_0 ^ 2 } {   2 k^2 ( k^2- m_0 ^ 2 ) } \\bigg ] p^{(0-w ) } \\nonumber \\\\     & & + \\frac{\\sqrt{3 } m_0 ^ 2}{2   k^2 ( k^2 - m_0 ^ 2 ) } \\bigg [ p^{(0-sw ) } + p^{(0-ws ) } \\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is a gauge parameter , @xmath29 is the set of the usual barnes - rivers operators , and    @xmath30}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we are assuming , of course , that @xmath31 and @xmath32 , so as to avoid tachyons in the model .",
    "let us them show that hdg is tree - level unitary at the aforementioned scales . to accomplish this , we make use of a method pioneered by veltman @xcite that has been extensively used since it was conceived .",
    "veltman s prescription consists in saturating the propagator with conserved external currents and computing afterward the residues at the simple poles of the alluded saturated propagator ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "if the residues at all the poles are positive or null , the model is tree - level unitary , but if at least one of the residues is negative , the system is nonunitary at the tree level .",
    "the saturated propagator in momentum space is in turn given by    @xmath34    here @xmath35    let us then suppose that @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , @xmath37 now , bearing in mind that for a massless graviton @xmath38 we come to the conclusion that @xmath39 therefore , at the scale at hand , hdg is unitary at the tree level and , as a consequence , the massive spin-2 ghost is completely harmless .",
    "now , owing to the great interest this gravity theory has aroused in the literature , it should be important to analyze the issue of the gravitational deflection in its framework and , using this result , to find bounds on its free constants .",
    "this is precisely our goal in this paper . to do that we shall study the gravitational deflection of a photon passing by the sun in the context of the gravity theory at hand using classical and tree - level approaches . since the @xmath40-sector of the model does not contribute anything to the gravitational deflection",
    ", we can not estimate an upper bound on the constant concerning this sector of the system by analyzing the light bending ; nevertheless , we shall discuss in the latter section of the paper , in passing , how to find a bound on this constant by using another classical test of gr . on the other hand , by suitable combining the classical and semiclassical results concerning solar gravitational deflection , we will be able to estimate an upper limit on the constant of the @xmath0-sector .",
    "the latter greatly improves the current bound available in the literature .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we study the gravitational deflection of light by the sun using a classical approach , while in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the solar gravitational bending of a photon at the tree level .",

    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",

    "we promptly obtain its linear approximation doing exactly as in einstein s theory .",

    "semiclassical gravity is based on the following type of approximation scheme : the metric is considered as a classical field , predetermined by the gravitational field equations which in our case are those of hdg ; besides , the energy content of some particles and/or fields are often neglected .",

    "however , if gravitational deflection measurements in the x - ray or ultraviolet bands were available , we could certainly improve the limit on @xmath101 .",
    "unfortunately , it is a very hard task to separate the signs present in these wavelengths from those emitted by the sun .",
    "accordingly , we come to the conclusion that the bound we have obtained is the best limit one can found using the gravitational deflection measurements available nowadays .    to conclude",
    ", we mention that we have estimated a bound on the constant of the @xmath40-sector of hdg using the accurate experimental results we have at our disposal today concerning the gravitational red shift of the spectral lines .",
    "this limit will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the cited classical text of gr was the first conceived by einstein to verify his theory but the last to have reliable experimental results ."
