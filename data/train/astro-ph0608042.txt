    "it is not my intention to review the historical development of ground - based gamma ray astrophysics or the experimental techniques employed in the field .",
    "interested readers are referred to an excellent recent review on those subjects  @xcite .",
    "neither is it my intention to discuss every source that has been detected , because this is no longer practical .",
    "instead , i will present a personal ( thus biased and incomplete ) perspective of the scientific impact of tev observations on astronomy and physics .",
    "since the detection of tev photons from the crab nebula  @xcite , the field of ground - based gamma ray astrophysics has experienced steady , albeit slow at times , growth in the 1990s and early 2000s .",
    "the sources detected were predominantly blazars , a subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , although several other important classes of sources , including pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , shell - type supernova remnant ( snr ) , and radio galaxy , were also represented .",
    "most intriguing was arguably the discovery of a source of tev radiation in the cygnus region@xcite , which , to date , still can not be associated with any known astronomical systems .",
    "the source , designated as tev j2032 + 4130 , is therefore the first unidentified tev source .",
    "the growth of the field has accelerated drastically since 2003 , thanks to the availability of a new generation of tev observatories ( hess in particular ; see  @xcite for a review on recent hess results ) , not only in terms of the total number of new sources seen but also in the significant increase of the number of galactic and unidentified sources detected .",
    "table  1 provides an updated list of the established tev sources , as of july 2006 .",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution of these sources in the sky .",
    "the clustering of unidentified sources around the galactic plane is interesting but , at least to some extent , is the result of a strong observational bias .",
    "in addition to discrete sources , diffuse tev emission is detected near the galactic ridge  @xcite and in the cygnus region  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps instructive to compare the development of the field with that of x - ray astronomy .",
    "i think that the field is roughly where x - ray astronomy was during the _ einstein _ days , when direct imaging became possible for the first time .",
    "coincidentally , it took both fields about the same amount of time to reach such a stage , following the detection of the first astronomical object ( other than the sun ) .",
    "a noteworthy difference is that a full sky survey had already been conducted with _",
    "uhuru _ before _ einstein _ was launched .",
    "survey is proven to be the most effective way of discovering new sources and thus providing guidance for deeper follow - up observations .",
    "tev astrophysics is no exception .",
    "many of the most exciting recent results have all come out of the hess survey of the galactic center region  @xcite .",
    ".known tev sources [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath0including only references in which the detection is first reported or confirmed or the counterpart(s ) suggested .",
    "+ @xmath1also a be binary .",
    "the precise mechanism for producing the detected tev photons is not understood at present .",
    "it probably varies from one class of sources to the other , or even from one source to the other in the same class .",
    "the proposed theoretical scenarios fall into two broad categories , leptonic models and hadronic models , hinging critically on the physical nature of the emitting particles .",
    "although details vary for different classes of sources , the general ideas are quite similar . in leptonic models ,",
    "the tev photons are attributed to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of low - energy photons by tev electrons ( and also positrons ) .",
    "the sources of seed photons may include synchrotron radiation from the electrons themselves ( i.e. , synchrotron self - compton , or ssc for short ) , other radiation within the system ( e.g. , emission from an accretion disk , companion star , broad - line regions , etc ) , and diffuse background radiation ( e.g. , cmb ) .",
    "in hadronic models , tev emission is thought to be associated with @xmath2 decay and , in some cases ( e.g. , blazars ) , with synchrotron radiation from ultra - relativistic protons in a strong magnetic field . in the following i",
    "briefly summarize the impact of recent results on our understanding of emission processes for each class of tev sources .",
    "[ fig01 ]      the emission from a blazar is generally thought to be dominated by radiation from a relativistic jet that is directed roughly along the line of sight ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the leptonic models associate the tev emission with the ssc process in the jet  @xcite .",
    "such models are mainly motivated by the observed correlation between x - ray and tev variabilities , as well as by the generic `` double - hump '' profile of measured seds .",
    "however , the simple ( thus commonly used ) version of the models are increasingly challenged by apparent exceptions to the `` rules '' , such as relatively loose ( or the lack of ) x - ray / tev correlation  @xcite and tev flares that either have no counterparts at x - ray energies or that are significantly offset in time from their x - ray counterparts  @xcite .",
    "the latter are sometimes referred to as `` orphan tev flares '' , even though they might not be truly orphan  @xcite . to clarify some confusion in recent literature ,",
    "i wish to note that there is hardly any difference between such flares in 1es 1959 + 650 and in mrk 421 , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has become difficult to fit the measured broadband sed with a one - zone ssc model ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , now that the quality of data is much improved , especially at tev energies .",
    "additional zones are almost certainly needed to overcome the difficulties .",
    "the hadronic processes are more complicated .",
    "it could involve photon - initiative cascade  @xcite or @xmath3 collisions  @xcite , but it all boils down to @xmath2 decay for gamma - ray production . for tev blazars ,",
    "however , it has been argued that @xmath2 decay is not important  @xcite ; it is the synchrotron radiation from ultra - relativistic protons in a strong magnetic field that is responsible for the observed tev photons from the blazars .",
    "the hadronic models also seem capable of describing the broadband sed of blazars  @xcite and , in principle , of accounting for the x - ray / tev correlation , if an appreciable amount of x - ray emission comes from synchrotron radiation of _ secondary _ electrons .",
    "there is quite some flexibility in this case , because the co - accelerated , primary electrons might also contribute to the x - ray band in a significant manner .",
    "this could explain the scatters in the x - ray / tev correlation .",
    "however , like the leptonic models , the hadronic models also face the challenge of explaining the observed tev flares with no or offset x - ray counterparts  @xcite .",
    "the most severe challenge is , however , provided by the rapid tev variability of blazars . in my view",
    ", the models are on the brink of being ruled out by the observed variability on a timescale of minutes both at tev energies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and x - ray energies  @xcite , at least for some sources .",
    "m  87 is the only source in this class that has been detected at tev energies .",
    "it is classified as an fr i object .",
    "for a long time , it is thought to be a source of ultra - high - energy particles  @xcite .",
    "the tev emission has been modeled both in the leptonic and hadronic scenarios . in the leptonic model  @xcite ,",
    "the tev photons are thought to originate in the ic process , as for blazars , but the jet is quite far from the line of sight .",
    "consequently , m  87 is thought to be a `` mis - aligned '' blazar .",
    "in the hadronic model  @xcite , on the other hand , the tev emission is thought to be associated with synchrotron radiation from protons , also similar to blazars .",
    "both models can account for the observed tev flux .",
    "unfortunately , m  87 is detected at a relatively low significance level ( @xmath4 )  @xcite , so little spectral information is available .",
    "the situation is expected to improve soon with the new generation of tev observatories .",
    "perhaps not too surprisingly , most recently - detected galactic tev sources fall in this class .",
    "after all , supernova remnants have long been suspected to be the main source of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "here , i arbitrarily draw a line between pulsar wind nebulae and shell - type supernova remnants . to date , six pwne and five snrs are fairly well established as sources of tev photons ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the tev emission mechanism is thought to be similar for pwne and snrs in leptonic scenarios but the detailed processes of particle acceleration are expected to be very different .",
    "the tev photons are produced in the ic scattering of mainly cmb photons by relativistic electrons accelerated either by a pulsar  @xcite or by a shock front at the outer edge of an snr  @xcite , although other sources of seed photons ( e.g. , star light ) may be needed in some cases to account for the observed broadband sed .",
    "since the x - ray photons are attributed to synchrotron radiation from the same electrons , the leptonic models can naturally explain the observed spatial coincidence between the x - ray and tev emitting regions .",
    "quantitatively , however , such models still have to overcome some difficulties in fitting the shape of the sed  @xcite .    on the other hand , the observed tev emission from pwne and snrs",
    "can also be explained as the product of the decay of neutral pions that are produced in the collision between the relativistic protons and surrounding medium  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the challenge is to account for the observed x - ray / tev spatial correlation .",
    "one can either attribute x - rays to synchrotron radiation from _ co - accelerated _ electrons  @xcite or invoke correlated enhancement of the magnetic field and the density of the surrounding medium  @xcite . at present , it is fair to say that no conclusive evidence exists for the acceleration of protons in snrs .",
    "both tev microquasars , ls  5039 and ls  i  + 61 303 , fall in the category of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hxmbs ) .",
    "this is intriguing , because this class of sources is dominated by low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "there are a number of noteworthy differences between the lmxb and hmxb microquasars .",
    "first of all , the luminous high - mass stars in the hmxbs provide a strong photon field for ic scattering , while such seed photons are expected to play a negligible role in the lmxbs .",
    "secondly , the accretion process in the lmxbs is almost certainly mediated by the overflowing of the roche - lobe of low - mass companion stars , while wind accretion is probably important in the hmxbs .",
    "thirdly , the lmxbs are exclusively transient x - ray sources , while the hmxbs are exclusively persistent x - ray sources .",
    "finally , the lmxbs ( at least some of them ) are known to experience episodic ejection events , with superluminal motion seen in some cases , while the jets appear to be steady , persistent , and only mildly relativistic in the hmxbs .",
    "i speculate that some of these differences may be relevant to the lack of detection of any lmxb microquasars at tev energies .    like other classes of tev sources , both leptonic  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a different interpretation ) and hadronic  @xcite models have been applied to tev microquasars . in the leptonic models ,",
    "the tev emission is associated with ic scattering by electrons .",
    "possible sources of seed photons include synchrotron photons ( i.e. , ssc ) , stellar photons , disk photons , or `` corona '' photons , but the first two appear to be most important .",
    "it is , however , being debated whether the ssc or stellar ic gives rise to the tev emission in microquasars  @xcite .",
    "a dominant stellar ic scenaro would naturally explain the absence of lmxb tev microquasars , as well as the observed orbital modulation of tev emission  @xcite , given both ls  5039 and ls  i  + 61  303 are in highly eccentric orbits .",
    "in the context of the ssc scenario , the orbital modulation could still be attributed to @xmath5 attenuation  @xcite , if the tev emission originates in the innermost region of the jet .",
    "the challenge is to explain why the ssc process apparently ceases to operate in the lmxbs , in spite of the fact that the jets in such sources tend to be more relativistic . to make progress ,",
    "a systematic observational effort is required not only to increase the size of the sample , but to collect _ simultaneous _ multiwavelength data . to date",
    ", modeling efforts have been based on non - simultaneous data , so the results should be taken with a grain of salt , given that microquasars are known to be highly variable on a wide range of timescales .",
    "microquasars are not the only x - ray binaries detected at tev energies .",
    "psr b1259 - 63 is also an x - ray binary that contains a 48-ms pulsar in a highly eccentric orbit ( with a period of @xmath63.4 years ) with a be star .",
    "typical of be x - ray binaries is that the wind of the be star is thought to be confined in the equatorial plane , due to rapid stellar rotation , and thus forms a dense circumstellar disk .",
    "therefore , the neutron star interacts with the disk twice for each time it goes around the be star .",
    "collision between the winds of the pulsar and be star leads to the formation of a strong shock , which is capable of accelerating particles to relativistic energies and thus makes such sources promising high - energy emitters  @xcite .",
    "the observed tev emission from psr b1259 - 63 can be modeled with ic scattering of stellar photons from the be star by relativistic electrons accelerated at the shock front  @xcite . in some sense",
    ", it combines some of the key characteristics of pwne and hmxb microquasars .",
    "given the role of the stellar photon field , one would expect strong orbit modulation of the tev emission , which appears to be present .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the tev emission appears to be at a lull at the periastron passage  @xcite , opposite to what one might naively expect .",
    "no detailed hadronic modeling has been performed .",
    "given the presence of a dense disk around the be star , the @xmath3 process might be quite efficient here , producing neutron pions , which then decay to produce the gamma rays seen  @xcite .",
    "arguably the most significant recent development in the field is the discovery of a population of unidentified tev sources ( see table  1 ) . of course ,",
    "_ unidentified _ does not necessarily imply _ unidentifiable _ or the lack of plausible counterparts .",
    "indeed , some of the initially unidentified sources have subsequently identified .",
    "for instance , hess j1813 - 178 is now associated with a shell - type supernova remnant ( g12.8 - 0.0 )  @xcite .",
    "the presently unidentified sources cluster around the galactic plane ( see fig .  1 ) , indicating that they are likely of galactic origin .",
    "looking at the plausible counterparts ( as shown in table  1 ) , it appears that most of them might be associated with a pwn or snr , which is supported by non - point - like tev emission regions .",
    "however , there are six sources that do not even have a plausible counterpart ( see table 1 ) .",
    "they are being referred to as `` dark accelerators '' .",
    "proposals have been made as to the origin of tev photons from such systems .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that for old snrs ( with age over @xmath7 yrs ) the ratio of the tev flux to the x - ray or radio flux can be very high  @xcite , which makes it difficult to detect them at long wavelengths .",
    "on the other hand , hess j1303 - 631 is postulated as the remnant of a gamma - ray burst that occurred in the galaxy some tens of thousands of years ago  @xcite .",
    "tev j2032 + 4130 is in the general region of the cyg ob2 association .",
    "strong winds from massive stars may collide and produce strong shocks that are capable of accelerating particles to relativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "the dense environment would be what is required for efficient @xmath3 processes and subsequent @xmath2 decay .",
    "more work is clearly required , both observationally and theoretically , to reveal the true nature of `` dark accelerators '' .",
    "tev photons may interact with infrared photons to produce electron - positron pairs and thus be effectively `` absorbed '' .",
    "this process must be taken into account in modeling the sed of all tev sources .",
    "cosmologically , the implication is that we can not look very far , due to the presence of diffuse infrared background .",
    "the flip side is that we may use observations of distant objects at tev energies to constrain the diffuse infrared background , which has remained a challenge for direct measurements .",
    "the results can have serious cosmological implications , because of the prospect of casting light on star formation in the early universe .",
    "the biggest surprise coming out of recent tev observations is the conclusion that the universe seems to be much more transparent than what was initially thought or , equivalently , the infrared background is much less intense  @xcite .",
    "the results are based on observations of two blazars at moderate redshifts . at the wavelengths of @xmath613 @xmath8 ,",
    "the derived upper limit is barely above the level of integrated light from galaxies that have been resolved by _",
    "it remains to be seen whether the results can be accommodated by any models .",
    "the results can be enhanced in two ways .",
    "one is to extend the spectral coverage to higher energies ( beyond 1 tev ) , e.g. , by observing brighter blazars , and thus extend the constraints on the ir background to longer wavelengths ; the other is to observe a large sample of blazars at a range of redshifts , with a goal of separating intrinsic and extrinsic effects .",
    "the latter is important , because our present understanding of the intrinsic spectral shape of the blazars ( or other objects ) is still quite incomplete .",
    "despite decades of intense observational and theoretical efforts , the origin of cosmic rays remains a mystery . for cosmic rays below @xmath9",
    "ev , it is almost taken for granted that they are associated with snrs in the galaxy .",
    "strong shocks at the outer edge of snrs are naturally thought of as the site for particle acceleration .",
    "if it is the case , snrs would be promising candidates for tev experiments .",
    "it is reassuring , therefore , that a number of snrs have indeed been detected at tev energies ( see table  1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this success has not led to convincing evidence for the production of cosmic rays in snrs . as discussed in   3.3 , it is still not possible , at present , to rule in or rule out either leptonic or hadronic scenarios , based on the existing data .",
    "it is , however , hopeful that the quality of data will be continually improved , which may eventually allow us to see some unique characteristics of @xmath2 decay .    on a different front ,",
    "the detection of diffuse tev emission in the cygnus region and around the galactic ridge has provided direct evidence for interactions between cosmic rays and molecular clouds in the galaxy  @xcite .",
    "spatial correlation between the galactic ridge emission and molecular clouds leaves little room for an alternative explanation .",
    "the measured gamma - ray spectrum indicates that the spectrum of cosmic rays near the center of the galaxy is significantly harder than that in the solar neighborhood , presumably due to propagation effects  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the density of cosmic rays seems to be many times the local density .",
    "it is argued that the observations can be explained by the presence of a particle accelerator near the galactic center that has been active over the past @xmath10 years .",
    "an obvious candidate is the supernova remnant sgr a east , which has about the right age .",
    "moreover , sgr a east is a plausible counterpart of hess j1745 - 290 ( see below ) , whose tev spectrum has a similar shape to the spectrum of the diffuse emission .",
    "the detection of hess j1745 - 290 raises the possibility of `` seeing '' dark matter in the vicinity of the galactic center with tev observations  @xcite .",
    "the region has long been thought of as the best place to search for gamma - ray emission resulted from the annihilation of dark matter particles  @xcite .",
    "while the prospect of detecting dark matter is exciting , such an origin is highly unlikely for hess j1745 - 290  @xcite , based on the incompatibility between the shape of the measured gamma - ray spectrum and that of theoretical expectations .",
    "a more plausible explanation is to associate the tev emission with an snr ( g359.95 - 0.04 or sgr a east ) or sgr a * , although the former seems more likely , given the apparent lack of variability of hess j1745 - 290  @xcite .",
    "m 87 has also been mentioned as a possible source of tev photons from dark matter annihilation  @xcite .",
    "tev data of much improved quality are expected to be available from magic and/or veritas , so a test of the hypothesis may become possible soon .",
    "other suggested sources of tev emission from dark matter annihilation include central regions of nearby galaxies in general , dwarf spheroidal galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and perhaps even globular clusters ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , and references therein ) , although there has been no positive detection of any such source at tev energies .",
    "tev astrophysics has become a viable branch of modern astronomy .",
    "it provides a unique window to the extreme non - thermal side of the universe .",
    "many classes of astronomical systems have been detected at tev energies .",
    "the observations have not only shed new light on the properties of the systems themselves but on the physical processes operating in diverse astronomical settings .",
    "for instance , taken together , blazars , microquasars , and gamma - ray bursts ( though none has been detected at tev energies yet",
    "@xcite ) may offer an excellent opportunity for us to make some tangible comparisons of the processes of particle acceleration and interaction in the jets of black holes over a vast range of physical scales ( from microparsecs to megaparsecs )  @xcite . as the capability of tev observatories improves , it is hopeful that more sources in the established classes and , more importantly , new classes of sources will be detected .",
    "the field is of equally great interest to physicists , because it has made it possible to study some of the most important questions in physics at energies much beyond the capabilities of present and future particle accelerators .",
    "independent of theoretical scenarios , tev observations are capable of constraining the intrinsic spectrum of emitting particles and thus casting light on the nature of the particles and on the acceleration mechanisms .",
    "tev observations have already begun to have a serious impact on modern cosmology .",
    "they have also provided insights into such fundamental issues as dark matter , primordial black holes , and lorentz invariance .",
    "the constraints are expected to improve as the quality of data improves . in many cases ,",
    "however , the challenge is to separate astronomical and physical origins of the tev photons detected .",

    "* teresa montaruli : * can we discuss the hess plot on the diffuse emission from 200 pc around the hess source in the galactic center region ? do we really need to increase the density of cosmic rays ?",
    "the harder spectrum can be explained by the absence of propagation effects close to the accelerator .",
    "* wei cui : * the plot shows the tev emission in the region after contribution from the detected point - like sources is removed .",
    "therefore , it is the amount of diffuse emission that requires a higher cosmic ray density than the local average . of course , there is always the possibility of residual contribution from weaker point sources that are below the detection threshold .",
    "however , the striking spatial correlation between the tev peaks and the molecular clouds points to a diffuse origin of the bulk of the emission .",
    "as for the required harder particle spectrum , the authors have indeed suggested as a plausible explanation the proximity of interaction regions to the sources that accelerate the particles ."
