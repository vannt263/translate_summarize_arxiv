    "large amplitude solitary waves ( sws ) in plasmas with a high energy ion beam have been observed at various space plasma environments , e.g. , the earth s magnetopause , in the van allen radiation belts as well as in the auroral zone @xcite .",
    "these nonlinear waves may be driven by the momentum exchange between the electrons and protons , or between different ion populations in multi - ion plasmas .",
    "propagation of such ion - acoustic ( ia ) sws ( iasws ) in magnetized or unmagnetized collisionless plasmas under different physical situations has been of considerable interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "using different methods , many authors have studied the behavior and characteristics of ia solitons both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in ion - beam plasmas .",
    "it has been found that the presence of energetic charged particles like ion beam in plasmas can significantly modify the propagation behaviors of sws @xcite .",
    "the latter with negative potentials have been found in the vicinity of ion beam regions of the auroral zone in the upper atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the spacecraft observations in the earth s plasma sheet boundary indicate that the electron and ion beams can also drive the broadband electrostatic waves @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the low - temperature plasmas containing charged dusts are ubiquitous in various space plasmas @xcite , laboratory devices @xcite as well as in industrial processes @xcite . the presence of such negatively charged dusts can significantly influence the collective behaviors of plasmas @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it has been shown that when an ion beam is injected into an unmagnetized plasma , three stable normal modes , namely the ",
    "fast \" and  slow \" ion - beam modes and the plasma ia wave exist in plasmas @xcite .",
    "furthermore , depending on whether the beam speed is of the order of or larger ( e.g. 2 times ) than the ia speed , the ia waves when coupled to slow beam mode may become unstable .",
    "such ion - ion instability has been confirmed experimentally by grsillon _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "thus , there may exist either three stable modes or one unstable and two stable modes .",
    "the nonlinear wave evolution of such three modes was investigated by yajima _",
    "et al _ @xcite in an ion - beam plasma .",
    "they showed that each of these modes can propagate as small amplitude korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) solitons when the beam density is smaller than the electron density and the amplitude is smaller than a critical value . in an another work ,",
    "nakamura _ et al _ @xcite had experimentally shown that the propagation of large amplitude iasws ( compressive type ) is possible for beam speed larger than the ia speed in an ion - beam plasma with two groups ( high and low - temperature ) of electrons .",
    "however , it seems that the effects of adiabatic positive ions and ion beam as well as their finite temperatures on the propagation of arbitrary amplitude dust iasws ( diasws ) in a plasma with charged dust impurities , have not yet been considered in detail .    in this paper",
    ", we study the properties of three linear eigenmodes , which may propagate as stable diasws . for typical plasma parameters relevant for",
    "experimental conditions @xcite , one of the modes may become unstable when the beam speed to dust ion - acoustic ( dia ) speed ratio lies in @xmath7 .",
    "the conditions for the existence of large amplitude diasws are analyzed by pseudopotential approach and their properties are studied numerically for fast modes .",
    "depending on the parameters , we show the existence of compressive as well rarefactive diasws .",
    "the latter exist when the ion to electron temperature ratio is of the order @xmath8 or more . on the other hand ,",
    "the diasws with small amplitudes are shown to propagate only of the compressive type .",
    "we consider an unmagnetized collisionless plasma composed of adiabatic positive ions , positive beam ions , boltzmann distributed electrons and negatively charged ( stationary ) dust grains in the background plasma .",
    "the finite temperatures of both the beam and plasma ions together with an equilibrium flow of the beam are considered .",
    "the normalized equations read @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively denote the number density , speed and the pressure of singly charged beam @xmath13 and plasma ions @xmath14 , normalized by the unperturbed number density @xmath15 , the ion - acoustic speed @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath19 is the temperature for @xmath20-th species ( @xmath21 for electrons ) and @xmath22 is the particle mass with @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath24 is the dia wave potential normalized by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the elementary charge .",
    "the space and time variables are respectively normalized by the debye length @xmath27 and the ion plasma period @xmath28 .",
    "the overall charge neutrality condition in the background plasma reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 in which @xmath32 is the dust number density and @xmath33 is the number of electrons on the dust grain . in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath34 is the temperature ratio for @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we have neglected the electron inertia , since the electron thermal speed is much larger than the ion / beam speed .",
    "it has been theoretically and experimentally shown that when beam ions are injected into an unmagnetized plasma , three longitudinal modes involving ion motions , namely an ion - acoustic wave and the fast and the slow space charge waves in the beam , can propagate @xcite . in order to identify those modes in our dusty beam plasma system",
    "we linearize the basic equations and assume that the perturbations vary as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the angular frequency normalized by @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the wave number normalized by @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we obtain the following dispersion relation .",
    "@xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath6 is the speed ( drift ) of beam ions in equilibrium . in absence of the ion beam ,",
    "dia mode propagates with the phase speed given by @xmath44 however , in absence of plasma ions the fast ( f ) and slow ( s ) modes propagate in the beam with the phase speeds , @xmath45        when the beam speed is much larger than the ion - acoustic speed , the beam and background ions are not strongly coupled .",
    "the background ions support slightly modified ion - acoustic waves and the beam ions support ion - acoustic waves ( f and s modes ) whose phase speeds are shifted by the beam speed @xmath6 .",
    "equation shows that the phase speed of the fast ( slow ) modes is larger ( smaller ) than the equilibrium beam speed @xmath6 .",
    "now , the dispersion equation ( [ 5-dispersion ] ) can be expressed as a polynomial equation in @xmath38 of degree @xmath46 , and when the phase speed is much larger than the dia speed , the dispersion relation gives real roots of the wave frequency .",
    "however , in the opposite case , the coupled wave modes can be stable for @xmath47 where @xmath48 and unstable when @xmath49 for typical laboratory plasma parameters @xcite @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the critical value of @xmath6 above which the modes are stable is @xmath54 , and for unstable modes we have @xmath55 .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to consider higher values of the beam speed ( i.e. roughly greater than 2 times the dia speed ) in order to avoid ion - ion instability @xcite .",
    "the latter has been confirmed in experiments @xcite .",
    "next , we numerically examine the dispersion relation ( [ 5-dispersion ] ) for the three wave modes which propagate along the beam direction .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 1 where a quartic equation in @xmath38 is contour plotted against the wave number",
    ". the behaviors of the modes are found similar as experimentally observed modes but in different beam plasmas @xcite .",
    "it clearly shows how the frequencies of the dia wave as well as the f and s modes get modified by the increase of the beam or ion density , the beam speed , the ion temperature as well as the percentage of impurity in the background plasma .",
    "we find that as @xmath56 increases [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] the phase speed of the f - modes ( s - modes ) decreases ( increases ) and that for the ia mode increases . however , the ion - temperature only modifies the dia mode as in fig .",
    "figure 1(c ) shows that the effect of the beam speed is to enhance the phase speeds of both the f and s modes .",
    "in contrast to fig .",
    "1(a ) , the enhancement of the charged dust concentration @xmath57 results into the increase ( decrease ) of the phase speed of f ( s ) modes , whereas the dia modes remain almost unchanged by the effect of @xmath57 . in the following section",
    "we determine the conditions for which these stable modes would indeed propagate as sws , and analyze their properties with different plasma parameters using the pseudopotential approach .",
    "assuming that the perturbations vary in the moving frame of reference @xmath58 , where @xmath2 is the nonlinear wave speed normalized by @xmath59 ( if @xmath2 be normalized by the phase speed of the ion - acoustic waves , it would then be called as the mach number ) , we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ 1])-([4 ] ) the following relation for the densities .",

    "we will consider @xmath2 to be larger than the beam speed in order to examine whether the fast modes propagate as solitary waves @xcite .",
    "similar analysis can also be done for the slow modes with @xmath66 . in obtaining eq .",
    "( [ 6-density ] ) we have used the boundary conditions , namely @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 as @xmath71 . furthermore , inspecting on eq .",
    "( [ 6-density ] ) , we find that the number densities are real when there exists a critical value @xmath72 of @xmath24 such that @xmath73 where @xmath74 note that the above restriction is valid only for large amplitude waves with positive potential . however , for waves with negative potential , the values of @xmath24 are not limited by the ratios , namely @xmath56 , @xmath75 or @xmath76 , @xmath77 . typically , for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath72 assumes the second term in the curly brackets in eq .",
    "( [ phi - max ] ) .",
    "however , this value must be considered together with the conditions for the existence of sws .",

    "here @xmath94 represents the amplitude of the solitary waves or double layers , if exist .    in order",
    "that the three modes propagate as sws the conditions ( i)-(iii ) must be satisfied .",
    "however , for the double layers to exist there must be an additional condition , i.e. , @xmath95 to be satisfied along with ( i)-(iii ) . we numerically analyze the conditions ( ii ) and ( iii ) for some typical plasma parameters as relevant for experiments @xcite .",
    "the condition ( ii ) , which results to eq . ( [ derivative - condition ] ) is presented in the @xmath96 plane as shown in fig . 2 for different sets of parameters .",
    "the white ( gray or shaded ) regions show the parameter space where the inequality ( [ derivative - condition ] ) is satisfied ( not satisfied ) .",
    "the upper boundary curves that separate the white and gray regions represent the minimum values of @xmath2 @xmath97 for the existence of solitary waves or double layers .",
    "the upper limits of @xmath2 ( with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) for the existence of positive sws can be obtained by substituting @xmath98 into @xmath99 [ cf .",

    "2(a ) and ( c ) ] is different . here",
    "the range of @xmath2 ( @xmath100 ) remains almost the same with the increase of @xmath76 .",
    "thus , for @xmath78 , sws may exist in the upper parts of the white regions .",
    "figure 3 shows the contour lines of @xmath99 [ thin ( red ) curves ] and @xmath86 [ thick ( blue ) curves ] for different values of @xmath2 .",

    "note , however , that with similar parameter values as in fig .",
    "3(b ) or ( c ) , the formation of negative sws was not reported in beam - plasma experiments @xcite . since there is no common point of intersection of @xmath108 except at @xmath87",

    ", the pseudopotential @xmath109 can be plotted against @xmath24 for a given set of physical parameters .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "4 that for both positive and negative values of @xmath24 , @xmath109 crosses the @xmath24-axis for the fast modes , implying the existence of both positive and negative sws .",
    "these different crossing points for certain values of the parameters give the height or amplitude @xmath110 of the sws .",
