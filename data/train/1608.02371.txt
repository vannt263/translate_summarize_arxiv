    "it is well known that the anomalous diffusion processes in various real - world complex systems can be well characterized by using fractional order anomalous diffusion models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) after the introduction of continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) in + @xcite .",
    "regarded as a natural extension of the brownian motions , the ctrws are proven to be useful in deriving the time or space fractional order diffusion system by allowing the incorporation of waiting time probability density function ( pdf ) and general jump pdf ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if the particles are supposed to jump at fixed time intervals with a incorporating waiting times , the particles then undergo a sub - diffusion process and the time fractional diffusion system is introduced to efficiently describe this process .    as stated in @xcite and + @xcite , instead of analyzing a system by purely theoretical viewpoint ( for example ,",
    "see @xcite ) , using the notions of sensors and actuators to investigate the structures and properties of systems can allow us to understand the system better and consequently enable us to steer the real - world system in a better way .",
    "this situation happens in many real dynamic systems , for example the optimal control of pest spreading ( @xcite ) , the flow through porous media microscopic process ( @xcite ) , or the swarm of robots moving through dense forest ( @xcite ) etc .",
    "it is now widely believed that fractional order controls can offer better performance not achievable before using integer order controls systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is the reason why the fractional order models are superior in comparison with the integer order models .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that in many real dynamic systems , the regional observation problem occurs naturally when one is interested in the knowledge of the states in a subregion of the spatial domain ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "focusing on regional observations would allow for a reduction in the number of physical sensors and offer the potential to reduce computational requirements in some cases .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that the concepts of regional observability are of great help to reconstruct the initial vector for those non - observable system when we are interested in the knowledge of the initial vector only in a critical subregion of the system domain .    motivated by the argument above , in this paper , by considering the locations , number and spatial distributions of sensors , our goal is to study the regional gradient observability of the riemann - liouville time fractional order diffusion process , which is introduced to better characterize those sub - diffusion processes ( @xcite . ) more precisely ,",
    "consider the problem @xmath2 below and suppose that the initial vector @xmath3 and its gradient @xmath4 are unknown and the measurements are given by using output functions ( depending on the number and structure of sensors ) .",
    "the purpose here is to reconstruct the initial gradient vector @xmath4 on a given subregion of the whole domain of interest .",
    "we also explore the characterizations of strategic sensors when the system is regional gradient observability . moreover , there are many applications of gradient modeling .",
    "for example , the concentration regulation of a substrate at the upper bottom of a biological reactor sub - diffusion process , which is observed between two levels ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) ;        anther example the energy exchange problem between a casting plasma on a plane target which is perpendicular to the direction of the flow sub - diffusion process from measurements carried out by internal thermocouples ( @xcite ) . for richer background on gradient modeling",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no results are available on this topic and we hope that the results obtained here could provide some insights into the control theory analysis of the fractional order diffusion systems and be useful in real - life applications .",
    "the rest contents of the present paper are structured as follows .",
    "the problem studied and some preliminaries are introduced in the next section and in section  @xmath5 we focus on the characteristic of the strategic sensors .",
    "an approach which enables us to reconstruct the initial gradient vector of the system under consideration in the considered subregion is addressed in section  @xmath6 .",
    "several application examples are worked out in the end for illustrations .",
    "in this section , we formulate the regional gradient observability problems for the riemann - liouville time fractional order diffusion system and then introduce some preliminary results to be used thereafter .",
