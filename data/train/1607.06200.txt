    "the low - dimensional quantum magnets on geometrically frustrated lattices are extensively studied during last years @xcite . an important class of such systems is lattices consisting of triangles .",

    "the constants in this equation are chosen so that the energy of the ferromagnetic state with the total spin @xmath11 is zero .",
    "-chain model.,width=288 ]    the isotropic delta chain ( @xmath12 ) with both antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( af delta chain ) has been studied as a function of the parameter @xmath15 sen , nakamura , blundell . in spite of the simplicity of this model it exhibits a variety of peculiar properties . if @xmath16 the model has two - fold degenerate ground state where neighboring pairs of spins form singlet configurations @xcite .",
    "when @xmath17 the delta chain supports the independent localized magnon states .",
    "these states determine both the ground states properties and the low - temperature thermodynamics in the vicinity of the saturation magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ground state is highly degenerate , the zero - temperature magnetization has a plateau and the specific heat has the extra low - temperature peak .",
    "in contrast to the af delta chain the same model with @xmath18 and @xmath14 ( the f - af delta chain ) is less studied .",
    "it is known @xcite that the ground state of the f - af isotropic delta chain is ferromagnetic for @xmath19 .",
    "it was argued in ref.@xcite on a base of numerical calculations that the ground state for @xmath20 is a special ferrimagnetic state .",
    "the critical point @xmath21 is the transition point between these two ground state phases .",
    "the isotropic f - af delta - chain at the transition point @xmath21 has been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the ground state at the transition point ( at zero magnetic field ) is macroscopically degenerate and consists of multi - magnon configurations formed by independent localized magnons and the special localized multi - magnon complexes .",
    "the isotropic f - af delta chain is a minimal model for the description of several magnetic compounds such as malonato - bridged copper complexes of formula @xmath22\\times \\lbrack cu(bpy)(mal)h_{2}o](clo_{4})_{2}$ ] containing magnetic @xmath23 ions @xcite . from the analysis of the experimental data",
    "it was concluded @xcite that the ratio of exchange interactions @xmath24 in this compound is @xmath25 .",
    "it means that this compound is on the ferrimagnetic side of the ground state diagram of the isotropic delta chain .",
    "thus , the study of the ferrimagnetic state of the f - af delta chain is important and interesting problem .",
    "numerical calculations used in ref.@xcite suppose that the ground state magnetization per site in the ferrimagnetic phase in the isotropic model is @xmath26 .",
    "unfortunately , numerical methods do not allow to obtain the detail information about the structure and the properties of the ferrimagnetic phase .",
    "at the same time this model is rather complicated and can not be tractable analytically .    in this paper",
    "we show that the analysis of the anisotropic f - af model in the limit of high anisotropy helps to understand the origin and the properties of the ferrimagnetic phase . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case of equal basal - apical and the basal - basal anisotropy @xmath27 . in this case with @xmath28 the ferrimagnetic phase can exist in a narrow interval of the value @xmath29 ( close to @xmath30 ) between the ferromagnetic ( at @xmath31 ) and the antiferromagnetic ( at @xmath32 ) phases @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to investigate the ferrimagnetic phase we put @xmath30 .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the f - af delta chain can be represented in a form : @xmath33   \\label{1 } \\\\ & & + \\sum_{i=1}^{n}[s_{i}^{z}s_{i+1}^{z}-s_{i}^{z}(\\sigma _ { i}^{z}+\\sigma _ { i+1}^{z})+\\frac{1}{4 } ]   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\]]where we put @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to study the model ( [ 1 ] ) for @xmath28 .",
    "we expect that some principal features of the ferrimagnetic phase of model ( [ 1 ] ) survive in the isotropic case .",
    "additional motivation of this study is related to the problem of ` order by disorder ' .",
    "the fact is that the model ( [ 1 ] ) in the limit @xmath36 turns into the classical ising model on the delta chain with equal but opposite in sign apical - basal and basal - basal interactions : @xmath37   \\label{ising}\\ ] ]    it is known @xcite that the ground state of this model is macroscopically degenerate and it is separated from the excited states by a finite energy gap .",
    "this degenerate ground state is disordered ( zero magnetization ) , and the main question of the ` order by disorder ' problem is what happens when such disordered system is perturbed by the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the quantum fluctuations can lift the degeneracy and drive the system to either ordered or disordered ground state .",
    "generally , there are many different ways of the introduction of such perturbations . one of them is given by the transverse terms in eq.([1 ] ) and we will show that it leads to the ordered ground state . on the contrary , the perturbation of the ising model ( [ ising ] ) by a transverse magnetic field results in the disordered ground state @xcite .",
    "another example of influence of quantum dynamics on the ising model ( ising ) was considered in ref.@xcite , where the anisotropic f - af model ( [ h1 ] ) was studied for a special choice of the exchange interactions and the anisotropies : @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for such choice of the interactions the f - af model describes",
    "the phase boundary between different ground state phases on the ( @xmath40 ) plane and reduces to the ising model ( [ ising ] ) at @xmath41 .",
    "the quantum fluctuations lift the ground state degeneracy of ising model ( [ ising ] ) but only partly , so that the degeneracy remains macroscopic on this phase boundary , it does not depend on @xmath8 and coincides with that for the isotropic f - af delta - chain at @xmath42 .",
    "the spectrum of low - energy excitations has a highly nontrivial multi - scale structure leading to the specific low - temperature thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "this special model is another example of ` disorder by disorder ' instead of ` order by disorder ' .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we study the spectrum of model ( [ 1 ] ) in different sectors of total spin @xmath43 and show that the ground state is ferrimagnetic one .",
    "in section iii we study the low - temperature thermodynamics of the system both analytically and numerically . in section iv we give a summary of our results .",
    "at @xmath36 the model ( [ 1 ] ) reduces to the ising model on the delta - chain described by hamiltonian ( [ ising ] ) .",
    "the total @xmath44 eigenstates of this model is divided in two subsets .",
    "the first one consists of degenerate ground states with zero energy .",
    "these states include two types of the spin configurations on triangles : either three spins in the triangle have the same orientation or two basal spins of the triangle are opposite oriented . in each triangle",
    "there are three configurations which satisfy these conditions .",
    "because the number of admissible configurations is the same for each triangle , the total number of the ground states is @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 states of the second subspace are separated from the ground states by a ` big ' gap with the energy @xmath47 .",
    "an infinitesimal perturbation of transverse interactions in eq.([1 ] ) lifts the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "however , a role of the first and the second terms in lifting is different .",
    "the first term has non - zero matrix elements both between the states of the first and the second subsets while the second term in eq.([1 ] ) has non - zero matrix elements between the states of the first and the second subsets only .",
    "thus , only the first term in eq.([1 ] ) gives contributions to an energy to the first order in @xmath48 whereas the second term is responsible for the corrections which are proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , to the leading order in @xmath48 we can neglect the second term in eq.([1 ] ) and the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) reduces to that given by @xmath50p   \\label{main}\\]]where @xmath51 is a projector onto the first subspace containing @xmath45 states and @xmath36 is assumed .",
    "the model ( [ main ] ) describes the basal @xmath52 chain with infinite @xmath1 interactions in the magnetic field produced by the static apical spins and the magnetic field in the @xmath53-th basal site is @xmath54 @xmath55 . as a result , the magnetic field acting on the basal spins depends on the spin configuration of apical subsystem . at",
    "first we consider the most simple case when all apical spins are up ( down ) producing the uniform magnetic field on basal subsystem : @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "it is easy to check that if all apical spins are up ( down ) , the projector @xmath51 in eq.([main ] ) eliminates the states in which two basal spins down ( two spins up ) occupy neighboring sites .",
    "the total number of allowable states is @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ main ] ) for the case @xmath56 takes the form @xmath59where @xmath60 is the projector onto the states with no neighboring spins down .",
    "the model ( [ oned ] ) can be mapped onto spinless fermions via the jordan - wigner transformation @xmath61where @xmath62 is the fermi - operator and we identify a spin down and a spin up as a particle and a hole , correspondingly .    in fermion language",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ oned ] ) reads@xmath63and the projector @xmath60 forbids two particles to occupy neighboring sites .    the model of the spinless fermions with such constraint ( infinite nearest - neighbor interaction )",
    "can be mapped onto the model of non - interacting fermions as follows @xcite ( for simplicity , we consider an open chain with @xmath10 sites ) .",
    "each configuration of @xmath64 fermions on @xmath10 sites with constraint is mapped to the configuration of @xmath64 fermions on @xmath65 sites without constraint by removing one empty site between two occupied sites .",
    "the hamiltonian of such model depends on a number of fermions and has a form @xmath66    besides , the matrix elements between the corresponding configurations of eq.([hf ] ) and eq.([hm ] ) are equal to each other .",
    "an equivalence of two models means that the dispersion relation in the spin sector @xmath67 is @xmath68where @xmath69with @xmath70 .    according to eq.([sp ] )",
    "the ground state energy of model ( [ hm ] ) in the limit @xmath71 but for a fixed fermion density @xmath72 is @xmath73    minimization of @xmath74 with respect to @xmath75 gives @xmath76and @xmath77    returning to the spin language , eq.([rho0 ] ) means that the ground state of eq.([oned ] ) is realized in the spin sector @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the total spin of the ground state of delta chain ( [ 1 ] ) is @xmath79    it follows from eq.([er ] ) that the energy of the lowest excitations in this spin sector is @xmath80i.e .",
    "the excitations are sound - like with the sound velocity @xmath81    the case with all apical spins down is considered in a similar way . in this case",
    "the role of the fermi - particles is played by the basal spins up and the total ground state spin is @xmath82 .",
    "we note that formulae similar to eqs.([er ] ) and ( [ rho0 ] ) have been obtained earlier by the bethe - ansatz method @xcite in the problem of an asymmetric diffusion of molecules with different size .",
    "eq.([er ] ) with @xmath83 defines the ground state energy of the hamiltonian ( [ main ] ) for the ferromagnetic configuration of the apical subsystem .",
    "now we need to consider other distributions of up and down apical spins .",
    "this problem can not be solved analytically and we use numerical calculations of finite chains .",
    "these calculations show that the most important configurations of the apical spin subsystem are the states with alternating domains of the up and down spins .",
    "the simplest configuration of such type is a two - domain structure consisting of @xmath84 spins up and @xmath85 spins down separated by two domain walls ( for cyclic chains ) .",
    "for the two - domain configuration the magnetic field induced by the apical spins is : @xmath86 for @xmath87 basal sites ; @xmath88 for @xmath89 sites ; and @xmath90 on two basal sites located in the center of two domain walls .",
    "( the ferromagnetic state of the apical spins considered above corresponds to @xmath91 or @xmath92 and it can be identified as the one - domain structure ) .",
    "it is apparent that the minimal energy of the two - domain state with @xmath93 is reached when the density of the fermions ( in fermionic language ) in each domain is @xmath94 .",
    "the total spin of this state is @xmath95 .",
    "it is clear that the energy of this state is higher than the ground state energy of the one - domain state due to the presence of defects ( the domain walls ) .",
    "the energy of the domain wall @xmath96 is defined as a half of the energy difference between the two - domain configuration with @xmath84 apical spins down and @xmath85 apical spins up and the one - domain ground state energy .",
    "the numerical calculations on finite chain @xmath97 for the dependence of the domain wall energy on the domain size @xmath96 are shown in fig.[edw - n ] .",
    "the energies of the one - domain and two - domain states are chosen for the optimal value of the total @xmath98 .",
    "as can be seen in fig.[edw - n ] the domain wall energy @xmath99 slowly depends on @xmath84 when the domain size @xmath100 and @xmath101 and rapidly converges to the value @xmath102 .",
    "similarly , any apical spin configuration can be represented as many domain structure consisting of @xmath103 domains with spins up and @xmath103 domains with spins down domains with @xmath104 domain walls .",
    "numerical calculations show that the ground state energy of the @xmath103-domain state is @xmath105where @xmath106 is the ground state energy of the one - domain configuration ( @xmath107 given by eq.([er ] ) .    in order to study the stability of the one - domain ground state with respect to a creation of the two - domain states we consider the dependence of the ground state of the one - domain configuration with all apical spins up , @xmath74 , for @xmath75 close to @xmath108 . according to eq.([er ] )",
    "the energy @xmath74 has a minimum at @xmath108 and can be expanded in @xmath109 as @xmath110where@xmath111    in an instability point the energies and the total spins of the one- and two - domain states are equal .",
    "the total spins of the one - domain state and two - domain one with @xmath84 up and @xmath85 down apical spins are @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively . as a result",
    "the instability point is determined by the relations @xmath114    as follows from eqs.([inst ] ) the instability occurs for @xmath115 and for small deviation from the minimum @xmath116 .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath117 the ground state is realized for the one - domain state in the total spin sectors with @xmath118 ( see eq.([l0z ] ) ) , while in the sectors @xmath119 the ground state corresponds to the two - domain structure .",
    "but the global ground state of the model ( [ main ] ) is twofold degenerate ferrimagnetic state with @xmath120 . in these states",
    "the magnetization on apical and basal sublattices are @xmath121 and @xmath122 , so that the total magnetization per site is @xmath123 .",
    "the ground state energy as a function of @xmath124 obtained by numerical calculations of finite delta - chains with @xmath125 and @xmath126 is shown in fig.[fig_e - sz ] .",
    "irregular form of this dependence is due to finite - size effects , which are caused mainly by the deviation of the particle density @xmath127 possible for a given chain length @xmath10 from the optimal value @xmath128 .",
    "however , as it can be seen in fig.[fig_e - sz ] the amplitude of oscillations decreases with @xmath10 and the expected thermodynamic limit @xmath129 is shown in fig.[fig_e - sz ] by thick solid line .",
    "the partition function @xmath130 of the model ( [ main ] ) is a sum of contributions to @xmath130 corresponding to all possible configurations of the apical spins .",
    "generally , each configuration of the cyclic delta - chain with @xmath131 domain walls is specified by a set of @xmath103 domains of the apical spins up with lengths @xmath132 and @xmath103 domains of the apical spins down of length @xmath133 which satisfy the conditions @xmath134where @xmath135 is a total number of down apical spins .",
    "then , the partition function @xmath130 is @xmath136where summation is carried out over @xmath137 satisfying relations ( rel ) and it includes two one - domain configurations with @xmath138 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath130 in eq.([z ] ) is a complicated problem .",
    "however , it can be simplified for low temperatures . as was noted before the ground state energy of the configurations with @xmath104 domain walls is higher than the one - domain state on the value @xmath139 .",
    "the same holds for the free energies . as an example",
    ", we represent in fig.[fig_df ] the difference between the free energies of the one - domain ( @xmath138 ) and two - domain ( @xmath140 ) configurations of cyclic chain with @xmath141 as the function of @xmath142 .",
    "this difference varies only slightly with @xmath142 and it is close to the energy of two domain walls @xmath129 , so that the deviation from the value @xmath129 is less than @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "it means that the two - domain partition function @xmath145 at @xmath146 can be written as @xmath147where @xmath148 is the partition function of the model ( [ oned ] ) describing the one - domain configuration .",
    "similarly , if all domain sizes are large ( @xmath149 ) , the free energy per site is the same for each domain and it is equal to that for the one - domain configuration .",
    "therefore , the partition function of the @xmath103 - domain configuration can be approximately written as @xmath150    then the partition function ( [ z ] ) takes the form@xmath151where @xmath152 for @xmath153 is the number of the configurations with @xmath104 domain walls .",
    "the weights @xmath152 are known @xcite @xmath154where @xmath155 are binomial coefficients and @xmath156 .",
    "the sum in eq.([z0 ] ) looks like the partition function of the 1d ising model of the apical spins @xmath157 with the effective nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction @xmath158 , i.e. the partition function @xmath130 at @xmath146 is a product of the partition functions of the model ( [ oned ] ) and that of the effective 1d ising model @xmath159 , i.e @xmath160 .",
    "it means that the free energy and other thermodynamic quantities are sums of those for the 1d ising model and for the model ( oned ) . as to the thermodynamics of the latter",
    "it can be obtained using the known spectrum of this model given by eq.([sp ] ) .",

    "the formula ( [ f0 ] ) coincides with that obtained by different method in ref.@xcite , where the @xmath52 chain in the vicinity of the triple point has been studied .    using eq.([f0 ] ) and well known thermodynamics of the 1d ising model we can obtain all thermodynamic quantities of the model ( [ main ] ) . as an example ,",
    "the specific heat @xmath173 as a function of @xmath142 is shown in fig.[fig_c - t_theory ] together with the contributions @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the specific heat has a sharp maximum at @xmath176 and the main contribution to it is given by the ising term , while the shoulder in @xmath177 at @xmath178 is related to the maximum in @xmath175 . at @xmath179",
    "the ` ising ' contribution @xmath174 is exponentially small and the specific heat is uniquely determined by that for @xmath175 @xmath180    as we noted before , eqs .",
    "( [ zr ] ) and ( [ z0 ] ) are valid when the domain sizes in the many domain configurations are large .",
    "to determine the temperature region for which this is the case we use the steepest descent method for the calculation of the sum in eq.([z0 ] ) . using stirling s formula for the binomial coefficients in @xmath152 we found that the main contribution to the sum is given by the terms with @xmath181where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are average lengths @xmath184 and @xmath185 of up- and down domains .    according to eq.([size ] )",
    "the representation of the partition function in the form ( [ z0 ] ) is valid if @xmath186 ( or @xmath187 ) . because @xmath188 we conclude that the partition function in the form ( [ z0 ] ) secures a correct thermodynamics of the model ( [ main ] ) for @xmath189 , while for @xmath190 it can give a qualitative description only .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations of finite systems show that all @xmath103 - dependence of the partition function @xmath191 for the configurations with small domains is expressed by the factor @xmath192 where @xmath102 as before . according to eq.([size ] ) for @xmath193 the average size of domains",
    "becomes @xmath194 .",
    "using these facts we take as an approximation for the @xmath103 - domain partition function @xmath195 the expression in a form @xmath196where @xmath197 is the partition function for the up - up - down - down @xmath198 configuration of the apical spins .",
    "then , the partition function @xmath130 at @xmath193 is @xmath199    the thermodynamics of the up - up - down - down configuration is found by an exact diagonalization ( ed ) calculation of finite chains .",
    "corresponding results for the specific heat are presented in fig.[fig_c - t ] . in fig.[fig_c - t ] we also represent the results of the ed calculations of the model ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath200 for @xmath201 .",
    "we note that the model ( [ 1 ] ) with large but finite @xmath202 and the model ( [ main ] ) are formally non - equivalent because the total number of states of these two models are different and include @xmath44 and @xmath45 states , respectively .",
    "however , in the temperature region @xmath203 the thermodynamics of the model ( [ 1 ] ) is governed by exactly @xmath45 states as follows from the temperature dependence of the entropy per spin ( see fig.[fig_s - t ] ) .",
    "thus , at @xmath203 the thermodynamics of the models ( [ main ] ) and ( [ 1 ] ) is identical . as it can be seen in fig.[fig_c - t ] , the data for @xmath177 for the model ( 1 ) with different @xmath10 deviate at @xmath204 both from each other and from the results for infinite system obtained from eq.(z0 ) .",
    "it means that the finite - size effects are essential in this temperature region . on the other hand ,",
    "the data for different @xmath10 are indistinguishable at @xmath205 , testifying that the finite - size data correctly describe the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we note also that at @xmath205 these data are close to those obtained from eq.([z1 ] ) for the up - up - down - down configuration . at the same time , the thermodynamics based on eqs.([z0 ] ) show the qualitatively similar behavior of the specific heat in this temperature region .",
    "lastly , we consider the temperature dependence of the zero - field susceptibility @xmath206 . in this case",
    "it is necessary to include the external magnetic field @xmath207 @xmath208 in the model ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we confine ourself by the temperature region @xmath204 where the partition function is the product of the ising and the one - domain terms .",
    "we do not dwell on the technical details of the corresponding computations .",
    "they are related to the solutions of eqs.([f0 ] ) and ( murho ) as the functions of the temperature and the magnetic field @xmath209 .",
    "the final result for the zero - field susceptibility @xmath206 has the form @xmath210where @xmath211 is the zero - field susceptibility per site of the above - mentioned effective ising model : @xmath212@xmath168 is the solution of eq.([murho ] ) with @xmath213 and @xmath214 is the susceptibility of the model ( [ oned ] ) given by @xmath215^{-2}dk   \\label{chi0}\\]]with @xmath216 determined by eq.([murho ] ) with @xmath213 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the quantity @xmath217 is shown in fig.fig_chi-t .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath218 is proportional to @xmath219 at @xmath220 while @xmath221 is finite @xmath222    therefore , the behavior of the susceptibility at low temperatures is determined by the ` ising ' contribution @xmath218 and , therefore , exponentially diverges at @xmath220 . in fig.[fig_chi - t ]",
    "we also represent the temperature dependence of @xmath217 for finite delta - chains obtained by the ed calculations of model ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the analytics predicting the exponentially divergence of @xmath217 in the thermodynamic limit , the calculations of finite chains show the finite limit for @xmath217 at @xmath170 .",
    "such behavior is related to the fact that the value @xmath217 at @xmath170 for finite @xmath10 equals to the square of the ground state spin which is @xmath223 , which turns into the divergence of @xmath217 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have studied the spin-@xmath0 f - af delta chain in the limit of large anisotropy of exchange interactions . in this",
    "limit the model reduces to the @xmath224 @xmath52 chain on basal sites in the static magnetic field depending on the domain structure of the apical spins .",
    "the ground state is twofold degenerate and magnetically ordered . in the ground state",
    "the apical spins form a fully polarized state with @xmath121 and the magnetization of the basal spins is @xmath225 .",
    "of particular interest are the excited states which involve the domain walls separating the domains of one or another ground state . based on the domain statistics we reduced the low - temperature thermodynamics problem to those for the effective 1d ising model for the apical subsystem and the @xmath224 @xmath52 chain with infinite @xmath1 interactions for the basal subsystem .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath226 and @xmath227 behave similarly to 1d ising ones with a correlation length proportional to @xmath228 at low temperatures .",
    "this simple picture provides a starting point for the qualitative understanding of the ferrimagnetic phase of the isotropic model .",

    "<S> we consider analytically and numerically an anisotropic spin-@xmath0 delta - chain ( sawtooth chain ) in which exchange interactions between apical and basal spins are ferromagnetic and those between basal spins are antiferromagnetic . in the limit of strong anisotropy of exchange interactions </S>",
    "<S> this model can be considered as the ising delta chain with macroscopic degenerate ground state perturbed by transverse quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> these perturbations lift the ground state degeneracy and the model reduces to the basal xxz spin chain in the magnetic field induced by static apical spins . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ground state of such model is ferrimagnetic . </S>",
    "<S> the excitations of the model are formed by ferrimagnetic domains separated by domain walls with a finite energy . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the system is effectively divided into two independent subsystems , the apical subsystem described by the ising spin-@xmath0 chain and the basal subsystem described by the xxz chain with infinite @xmath1 interactions . </S>"
