    "exploration of the phases of strongly interacting matter is the main purpose of the study of high energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "theoretical considerations  @xcite suggest that the phase boundary between confined hadrons at low and quasi - free quarks and gluons at high temperature and/or density is of the first order in systems with large net - baryon density ( or equivalently baryochemical potential @xmath0 ) .",
    "lattice qcd calculations  @xcite can provide quantitative predictions at zero net baryon density ( @xmath1 ) and find that the transition is a rapid crossover .",
    "thus a critical point is expected as the endpoint of the first - order transition line . however , lattice qcd is not yet able to cope with @xmath2 in a strict way .",
    "predictions of the existence and location of the critical point ( cp ) in the phase diagram of t versus @xmath3 have to be obtained from extrapolations which arrive at conflicting results .",
    "some find a cp in a region accessible to experiments at the sps and the rhic beam energy scan  @xcite , others locate the cp at high @xmath3 where heavy - ion experiments are not able to produce the deconfined phase  @xcite or they find no cp at all  @xcite . clearly it is important to address this issue by experimental studies .        at a cp",
    "the correlation length @xmath4 diverges leading to a strong increase of suitable correlation measures such as event - to - event fluctuations of the multiplicity and average transverse momentum of produced particles  @xcite as well as local density fluctuations resulting in the appearance of intermittency in particle production  @xcite .",
    "owing to the finite size and short lifetime of the fireballs produced in collisions of nuclei , @xmath4 is expected not to exceed 3 - 6 fm in pb+pb collisions .",
    "moreover , correlations may be diluted by rescattering of the produced particles before final freezeout .",
    "a scan of the phase diagram by varying the sizes of colliding nuclei ( change of rescattering probabilty ) and energies of the collisions ( change of @xmath3 ) is a promising search strategy  ( see fig .",

    "the na49 detector was upgraded by a new cellular zero degree calorimeter ( projectile spectator detector ) with single beam nucleon energy resolution and a he filled beam pipe trough the tpcs to reduce beam induced @xmath5-ray background .",
