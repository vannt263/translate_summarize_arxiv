    "what set of cosmological parameters characterizes our universe ?    according to the most popular cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario , the universe consists of baryonic matter and a substantial amount of `` dark '' matter .",

    "taken together , these pieces of evidence suggest that the baryonic and dark matter content of the universe is supplemented by an additional smooth component with negative pressure , @xmath16 , modeled by the equation of state @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the density of this component , @xmath4 is a dimensionless state parameter of order unity ( cf .",

    ", degeneracies will remain among the cosmological parameters that can be estimated from the results ( efstathiou & bond 1999 ; zaldarriaga , spergel & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "the importance of using a wide range of methods , therefore , is twofold .",
    "first , a simultaneous consideration of all data sets should allow the best joint estimation of the cosmological parameters .",
    "second , the agreement of different techniques for measuring the cosmological parameters should provide a cross - check of our understanding of the underlying processes and a control against systematic errors . as we extend our analysis of the cmb to more complicated models ( tensor fluctuations , finite neutrino masses , etc . )",
    "the number of cosmological parameters increases , and it becomes even more important that the widest possible range of datasets is used , and that strong controls against systematic errors are in place .",
    "many of the techniques of cosmological parameter estimation use clusters as tracer particles . as a result",
    "there is a large number of planned cluster surveys in the two most important non - optical observational indicators of clustering : the sz effect and cluster x - ray emission .",

    "cluster evolution , the redshift distribution of clusters from sz and x - ray surveys , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and cluster number counts as a function of x - ray flux , @xmath22 , are important constraints on cosmological parameters .",

    "holder , haiman & mohr ( 2001 ) discussed the constraints on the parameter space defined by @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the normalization of the matter power spectrum ) using cluster evolution .",
    "holder et al . showed that constraints from cluster evolution and sne ia observations are highly complementary to each other .",
    "@xcite discussed the constraints on the @xmath27 parameter space , assuming a spatially flat geometry ( @xmath28 ) , that follow from an sz effect survey and a large angle deep x - ray survey ( the cosmology explorer ; ricker and lamb ) .",
    "they found that @xmath20 and @xmath21 , combined with constraints from cmb or sne ia experiments , significantly reduce the degeneracies between @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . @xcite estimated the constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath4 for flat geometry that can be gained by combining results from snap , planck and sz and x - ray surveys .",
    "as has been realized , the angular diameter distance - redshift relation , @xmath0 , is at the heart of many of these techniques , and is sensitive to some important combinations of cosmological parameters while being degenerate under others @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite estimated constraints on the pairs of quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( the latter in a flat universe ) from the @xmath0 function based on current sne ia data combined with cmb first peak constraints .",
    "the analysis shows that the constraint on parameters based on @xmath0 is nearly orthogonal to the constraint based on the position of the first peak in the cmb fluctuation spectrum .",
    "these two datasets are thus highly complementary , and form a particularly powerful pair of measurements ( see also tegmark et al",

    "the shape and normalization of the observed angular diameter distance function constrains several cosmological parameters ( the standard formulae for distance in friedmann - robertson - walker universes are given in , for example , peebles 1993 ) .",
    "the distance - redshift function , @xmath0 , in cdm models depends on the matter density , cosmological constant and hubble constant , and any other particle density which contributes to the curvature of space - time .",
    "the slope of the distance - redshift function at low redshift is a measure of the hubble constant , while the shape of the function depends on the curvature and the different densities . in figure",
    "[ f : fig1 ] we show the fractional difference in @xmath0 with fixed matter density and hubble constant ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , but various values cosmological constants ( @xmath3 = 0.7 , 0.6 , 0.3 , solid , dashed and dash dotted lines ) relative to a model with zero cosmological constant ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "it can be seen from this figure , that @xmath0 is most sensitive to the value of the cosmological constant at redshift about unity , and quite insensitive to that at small or high redshifts . in the redshift interval from @xmath34 to @xmath35 the angular diameter distance for flat ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) model is more than 10@xmath38 different from a model with the same matter density but zero cosmological constant ( @xmath36 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "we can expect high precision data from hundreds of clusters of galaxies in the near future . with the present instrument suite ,",
    "the statistical errors on individual measurements will be small , and so the usefulness of the data will be limited by their systematic errors . in this paper",
    "we evaluate the error budget of distance determination based on the sz effect and x - ray measurements ( assuming that the x - ray output is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung , as is appropriate for the hot clusters in which the sz effect is strong ) , and provide a realistic estimate of errors achievable in the angular diameter distance .",
    "we estimate how well one will be able to constrain the two parameter sets @xmath40 , and @xmath27 ( assuming a spatially flat geometry , @xmath41 ) if this @xmath0 function is combined with the position of the first doppler peak in the angular power spectrum of cmb fluctuations .",
    "our treatment is complementary to previous work of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who used @xmath20 , @xmath24 , and @xmath42 to constrain cosmological parameters , since we discuss the importance of @xmath0 .",
    "it also complements the work by @xcite , who used @xmath0 determined from existing sne ia data to constrain @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ( flat ) : the errors from the sz / x - ray technique have significantly different characteristics , and we are concerned with the limitations that will be encountered with future survey data .    in the next section",
    "we briefly describe the well - known method of angular distance determination based on the sz effect and thermal bremsstrahlung with an emphasis on how measurements are used , and how their error propagate to the angular diameter distance . in section  [",
    "s : errors ] we give a detailed analysis of the error budget , in section  [ s : constraints ] we discuss the constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "finally , section  [ s : conclusion ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "distance determinations using the sz effect and x - ray emission from the intra - cluster medium ( sz / x method hereafter ) are based on the fact that these processes depend on different combinations of physical parameters of the clusters . the sz effect ( sunyaev and zeldovich 1980 ; for recent reviews cf .",
    "birkinshaw 1999 , and rephaeli 1995 ) is a result of inverse compton scattering of cmb photons off hot electrons in the intra - cluster ( ic ) gas .",
    "the number of photons is conserved , but , on average , the photons gain energy , and thus generate a decrement in the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum and an increment in the wien region .",
    "the amplitude of the sz effect does not depend on the redshift of the cluster .",
    "we will discuss static thermal and kinematic thermal sz effects in this paper , where the `` static '' effect is present in all clusters , and the `` kinematic '' effect is only present for those clusters with a non - zero line - of - sight ( los ) peculiar velocity relative to the hubble flow .",
    "a typical rayleigh - jeans decrement of the static sz effect is about about 50 times that of the kinematic sz effect .",
    "the static sz effect is proportional to the los pressure integral of the ic gas @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the frequency dependence of the effect ( @xmath47 in the non - relativistic rayleigh - jeans limit ) , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the electron density and temperature as functions of position within the cluster .",
    "the central x - ray surface brightness of a cluster is emission - weighted line - of - sight average of @xmath50 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the cooling function integrated over the de - redshifted energy band of observations and @xmath53 is the metal abundance of the gas .    on any given los ,",
    "equations  [ e : sz_1 ] and [ e : thbr_1 ] , and the emission weighted x - ray temperature , @xmath54 ( from spectroscopy ) , provide three independent integral constraints for the two functions , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , although these functions can not be determined uniquely .",
    "if , instead , one assumes parameterized functional forms for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , these three equations can be used to constrain the controlling parameters .",
    "one important parameter that can be found from fitting the data is a characteristic los physical size of the system , @xmath57 , and the angular diameter distance of the cluster can then be determined if this size is compared with the corresponding angular size , @xmath58 .",
    "however , we can measure only the apparent characteristic angular size , @xmath59 of the system as it appears projected into the plane of the sky ( with corresponding physical size @xmath60 ) .",
    "the main difficulty in the sz / x method is the de - projection of the cluster from its 2-d images , that is the problem of finding the value of @xmath58 from the measured value @xmath59 .",
    "if this can be done , one can determine the angular diameter distance as @xmath61 if one assumes spherical symmetry , @xmath62 , and a de - projection is possible without further assumptions about the functional forms of @xmath48 and @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this method , however , needs high signal / noise and high angular resolution sz _ and _ x - ray images of the cluster , and thus the analytic de - projection has not been used so far .",
    "most commonly , the distribution of gas in clusters is described by the spherical isothermal beta model @xcite .",
    "this model seems to give a good fit to x - ray data @xcite , and thus it is usually assumed that the ic gas follows a spherical isothermal @xmath64 model , where the ic gas is isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the cluster .",
    "the electron concentration in the cluster atmosphere is then @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the core radius ( a suitable characteristic size of the cluster ) .",
    "the shape parameter @xmath64 describes how the kinetic energy is distributed between the galaxies and ic gas .",
    "typically @xmath66 = 0.1 h@xmath67 mpc , and @xmath68 @xcite . in practice",
    ", the ic gas temperature is determined from x - ray spectroscopy , the core radius projected in the plane of the sky , @xmath69 , and the shape parameter @xmath70 are determined from fitting the @xmath64 model to a high resolution x - ray image .",
    "finally equations  [ e : sz_1 ] and [ e : thbr_1 ] are used to determine the angular diameter distance using equation  [ e : d_a1 ] @xmath71 which is crucially dependent on the assumption of spherical symmetry : @xmath72 .",
    "if we adopt the beta model representation , we can write the angular diameter distance as a function of measurable quantities for a cluster as @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the central sz effect and x - ray surface brightness ( un - absorbed ) , @xmath76 , is the absorbing column density , and @xmath77 is a known function of @xmath64 ( or other parameters if a different description of the structure of the cluster is used ) . some of the measured ( or estimated ) quantities on the rhs of this equation",
    "are highly correlated , so a careful error analysis is needed : the errors on individual quantities can not be added in quadrature .",
    "no bootstrapping is required in using eq .",
    "[ e : d_a_prop ] ( it is a direct method , with no need for using the usual cosmic distance ladder ) as was realized by sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1980 ) , but the strong assumptions of spherical symmetry and isothermality are only crude approximations to the real situation .",
    "it has been pointed out recently that relativistic effects become important for high temperature clusters @xcite .",
    "relativistic corrections to the inverse compton scattering have been calculated and used to interpret observations in terms of the hubble constant ( rephaeli 1995 ; birkinshaw 1999 ; birkinshaw & hughes 1998 ; holzapfel et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "relativistic corrections to the thermal bremsstrahlung cooling function are also needed @xcite .",
    "these corrections are in the order of 3@xmath38 in @xmath12 for high temperature ( @xmath78 10 kev ) cluster . in this paper",
    "we assume that relativistic corrections have been made and we will not discuss their effect in detail .",
    "errors in the determination of the angular diameter distance may be cast into two major categories : errors from measurements , and errors from theoretical modeling .",
    "measurement errors can be statistical or systematic , while errors from theoretical modeling are systematic by nature .",
    "the systematic errors can be further classified as `` random '' or `` non - random '' depending on whether they average out or not for a statistical sample of clusters . in what follows we therefore use the expressions `` random modeling errors '' when discussing errors which introduce only scatter in the distance determination when averaged over an unbiased sample of clusters , and `` non - random modeling errors '' when discussing errors which introduce a bias in the distance determinations even for an unbiased sample of clusters .    in this section",
    "we summarize the statistical and systematic errors associated with the sz and x - ray observations , following the discussions in reports of the latest interferometric observations ( from bima , reese et al .",
    "2000 ; and from the ryle telescope [ rt ] , grainge et al . 1999 ) , and in review articles ( birkinshaw 1999 ) .",
    "we also use some additional references to compile a detailed list of error sources .",
    "statistical errors from measurements in the angular diameter distance are dominated by counting statistics in x - ray images and spectra , and by gaussian measurement uncertainties in the sz measurements .",
    "these statistical errors propagate to errors in @xmath79 and @xmath64 through fitting for the spatial distribution , and to errors in @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath53 , and @xmath76 through fitting the x - ray spectrum",
    ". a simultaneous fit of a @xmath64 model on interferometric sz and x - ray images determines @xmath79 , @xmath64 , @xmath75 and @xmath74 ( e.g. reese et al . 2000 ) , but causes the errors in these parameters to be strongly correlated .",
    "the most important error sources in a determination of the angular diameter distance are the error in @xmath75 and the error in @xmath80 ( eq .  [ e : d_a_prop ] ) .",
    "the electron temperature enters the estimate of @xmath12 roughly as @xmath82 , since for most x - ray observations to date the x - ray emissivity , @xmath83 is a slowly - varying function of @xmath80 .",
    "other uncertainties , from the dependence of @xmath81 on the abundance of metals in the icm and the absorbing column on the line of sight , are less important , and we can also neglect the contribution to the error in the angular diameter distance from the redshift .",
    "the error in the spatial fit is dominated by the uncertainty in the central sz decrement , @xmath74 , and central x - ray surface brightness , @xmath75 .",
    "both errors are about 8 - 10@xmath38 in the data obtained using bima and rosat . the total uncertainty in a @xmath12 estimate from spatial fitting to x - ray imaging and sz interferometric measurements ( with bima or the rt ) is about 14 - 18@xmath38 .",
    "we can expect a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of @xmath75 in the near future because of the larger collecting area and higher angular resolution of xmm and chandra , and because the improved imaging will also allow a better choice of models for the icm .",
    "a substantial improvement in the central sz effect is also likely , as the first generation of dedicated sz interferometers becomes available .",
    "the overall statistical error in these parameters should drop to about 4 - 5@xmath38 .",
    "the statistical errors in measurements of electron temperature based on asca and rosat observations are up to about 15 - 20@xmath38 @xcite . with today s technology ( chandra and xmm ) ,",
    "a 5@xmath38 statistical error in the emission - weighted average electron temperature of a well - defined region of a high redshift cluster should be straightforward @xcite .",
    "the principal identified systematic errors in the measurements arise from the absolute calibration of the radio and x - ray observations .",
    "errors in the effective area of the rosat pspc and hri introduce an error of about 10@xmath38 in @xmath12 .",
    "this error is greatly reduced ( to 12@xmath38 ) for the instruments on chandra and xmm - newton .",
    "the absolute calibration error of radio interferometers is good to 4 - 5@xmath38 , but could be improved to about 1@xmath38 through extensive observations of point sources , tied to the planetary flux density / brightness temperature scale @xcite .",
    "ground - based interferometric observations are also subject to systematic errors due to the removal of background ( and cluster ) radio sources , which may be imperfect if the sources are variable or have significant angular extent .",
    "imperfect calibration of the phase and amplitude of the detector system may also cause errors near brighter contaminating sources .",
    "fortunately interferometers are insensitive to large scale gradients in emission from the ground and atmosphere , and so this source of systematic offset signals from single - dish data is largely removed in interferometric work ( e.g. , carlstrom et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the modeling of the structure of the icm is an important part of determining the distance to a cluster , since it is the model that makes it possible to connect the los size of a cluster to its apparent angular size projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "following most treatments in the literature , we use isothermal spherical @xmath64 models to describe the ic gas distribution , and in this section discuss the errors introduced by deviations from this model . as before ,",
    "we can identify random and non - random systematic modeling errors .",
    "significant random modeling errors arise from the _ asphericity _ of the intra - cluster gas , the _ peculiar velocity _ of the cluster , and _ primordial cmb fluctuations_. serious non - random modeling errors can be expected from _ non - isothermality _ , _ cooling flows _ , _ clumping _ , _ merging _ , and _ finite extent _ of the cluster .",
    "other issues that may be important are _ radio point sources _ and _ gravitational lensing_. we briefly discuss random modeling errors from resolved radio halos in clusters because of their contribution to the measured sz signal ( through synchrotron emission ) and to the x - ray signal ( through inverse compton emission ) , the effect of diffuse free - free emission from cool gas ( for example in spiral galaxies ) , and finite optical depth effects .",
    "_ asphericity _ is one of the most important source of systematic errors in the determination of the distance to clusters when using a spherically symmetric isothermal @xmath64 model .",
    "if the cluster is not spherical , the assumption that @xmath72 is invalid .",

    "peculiar velocities also introduce a small bias in the redshift determination of the cluster .",
    "if clusters are selected based on their sz signal , this effect would cause a biased sample of clusters , and a systematic overestimate of @xmath12 would result .",

    "numerical simulations show similar errors due to non - isothermality : thus @xcite s simulations lead us to conclude that an overestimate of 25@xmath38 in @xmath12 , mostly because of the overestimated sz amplitude , may result from assuming isothermality when the temperature is lower in the outer regions .",
    "simulations of merging clusters by @xcite obtained a similar result , that an overestimate of 10 - 30@xmath38 may result in @xmath12 from non - isothermality , with the range depending on the projection geometry .",
