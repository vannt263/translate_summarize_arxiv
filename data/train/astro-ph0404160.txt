    "high - resolution _ chandra _ observations have revealed various substructures in the hot x - ray emitting plasmas in clusters of galaxies .",
    "for example , sharp discontinuities of x - ray surface brightness distributions have been found around subclusters moving in a cluster of galaxies such as a2142 @xcite and a3667 ( vikhlinin , markevitch , & murray 2001b ) .",
    "the temperature drops sharply across this boundary between the gravitationally confined , cold dense plasmas in the moving subcluster and the hot , less - dense ambient plasma .",
    "this sharp discontinuity is called the cold front .",
    "it is not a shock front , because _ chandra _ images of the x - ray surface brightness show that the temperature decreases in the denser side .",
    "@xcite suggested that the sharp temperature gradient observed by _",
    "chandra _ in a2142 requires the heat conductivity near the front to be reduced by several orders of magnitude from the classical spitzer value @xcite , @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "based on the observations of a3667 , vikhlinin , markevitch , & murray ( 2001a ) suggested that turbulent , intergalactic magnetic fields stretched along the cold front reduce the growth rate of the kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instability , which possibly destructs the front .",
    "furthermore , heat conduction across the magnetic fields can be suppressed .",
    "it has been recognized that heat conduction in a cluster of galaxies can be very efficient ( e.g. , @xcite ) because the coulomb mean free path , @xmath2 , is large . here",
    ", @xmath3 is the number density . the time required for heat to diffuse by conduction across a length @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the density .",
    "however , if magnetic fields exist , the characteristic length of the heat exchange across magnetic field lines is reduced to the larmor radius , @xmath7 @xmath8 . since the typical magnetic field strength in a cluster of galaxies is @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "the heat conductivity across magnetic field lines is drastically reduced .    in this letter",
    ", we present the results of numerical simulations of the formation of cold fronts .",
    "these simulations include the effects of heat conduction .",
    "we adapted the simulation code , originally developed for solar flare simulations @xcite , which includes anisotropic heat conduction along magnetic field lines .",
    "we simulated the time evolution of the cluster plasma in a frame comoving with the subcluster .",
    "the basic equations are as follows ,    @xmath10    @xmath11 = -\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}{\\it p } +   \\frac{(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$ } \\times   \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$ } ) \\times \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}{4 \\pi }   - \\rho \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$ } \\psi,\\ ] ]    @xmath12    @xmath13 + \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$$\\cdot$ } \\left [ \\left(\\frac{1}{2 } \\rho v^{2 } + \\frac{\\gamma p}{\\gamma -1 } \\right ) \\mbox{\\boldmath$v$ } + \\frac{1}{4 \\pi } ( -\\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$ }   \\times \\mbox{\\boldmath$b$ } )   \\times \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$ } - \\kappa_{\\parallel }    \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla_{\\parallel}$ } t \\right ] = - \\rho \\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$ $ \\cdot$ $ \\nabla$ } \\psi,\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the density , velocity , pressure , magnetic fields , and gravitational potential , respectively .",
    "we use the specific heat ratio @xmath18 .",
    "the subscript @xmath19 denotes the components parallel to the magnetic field lines .",
    "we assume that heat is conducted only along the field lines .",
    "we solved the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations by a modified lax - wendroff method with artificial viscosity .",
    "the heat conduction term in the energy equation is solved by the sor method ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the units of length , velocity , density , pressure , temperature , and time in our simulations are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "we adopted two - dimensional cartesian coordinates @xmath26 by assuming translational symmetry in the @xmath27-direction .",
    "the typical size of the simulation box and the number of grid points are @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the initial density distribution .",
    "we assume that the subcluster is a sphere having a radius @xmath30 , and it is isothermal with temperature @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that the gravitational potential at @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 $ ] , where we use the core radius @xmath34 , and the sound speed inside the subcluster @xmath35 , where the subscript @xmath36 denotes the values inside the subcluster .",
    "the density distribution is determined by the hydrostatic equation @xmath37 , as @xmath38 $ ] , where we adopt @xmath39 .",
    "we also assume that the subcluster is surrounded by hot @xmath40 , less - dense @xmath41 plasma , where the subscript @xmath42 denotes the values outside the subcluster .",
    "the gravitational potential is taken to be fixed throughout the simulation .    in order to simulate the moving subcluster in a cluster of galaxies , we assume that ambient plasmas initially have a uniform speed with mach number @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the sound speed of the ambient plasmas . the mach number with respect to the sound speed inside the subcluster",
    "is @xmath45 .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] shows the model parameters .",
    "models h and hc are without magnetic fields . in models m and mc , we assume uniform magnetic fields parallel to the @xmath46-axis . in these models ,",
    "the initial ratio of the ambient gas pressure to the magnetic pressure ( @xmath47 ) is taken to be @xmath48 , which corresponds to the magnetic field strength @xmath49 .    in models",
    "hc , mc , and mtc we included heat conduction . when the magnetic field does not exist , heat is conducted isotropically .",
    "when the coulomb mean free path @xmath50 becomes comparable to or greater than the temperature scale height @xmath51 , the heat flux @xmath52 is saturated as @xmath53 \\kappa_{\\rm sp }   \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$ } t$ ] when @xmath54 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our initial model , since @xmath55 and @xmath56 around the cold front , @xmath57 at the front is smaller than 15% of the classical value .",
    "however , this reduced heat flux is large enough to smear the cold front within @xmath58 because the conduction time scale across the cold front is @xmath59 .    when the magnetic field exists , heat is conducted only in the direction parallel to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the conductivity parallel to the field lines is @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "conversely , the conductivity across the field lines is @xmath62 .",
    "the conduction time scale along the field lines is @xmath63 @xmath64 .    in model mtc , we simulated a subcluster moving in an ambient plasma with initially disordered magnetic fields , and we included the effects of heat conduction . in this model , we superposed magnetic fields created by thin currents flowing in the @xmath27-direction .",
    "the location and strength of the thin currents are chosen randomly . in this particular model ,",
    "the size of the simulation box is @xmath65 , and the number of grid points is @xmath66 .    the left boundary at @xmath67 is taken to be a fixed boundary , except in model mtc . in model mtc , the magnetic fields at the left boundary are extrapolated from magnetic fields in internal points .",
    "other quantities are fixed at the left boundary .",
    "the effects of the left boundary condition is negligible in the time range we report in this letter .",
    "other boundaries are free boundaries where waves can be transmitted .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the distributions of density , temperature and x - ray intensity for model mc ( upper panels ) and model hc ( lower panels ) at @xmath68 ( 0.9 gyr ) .",
    "model mc includes the effects of anisotropic heat conduction ; that is , heat is conducted only in the direction parallel to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the x - ray intensity distribution is visualized from the simulation results as the logarithm of @xmath69 . in model hc with isotropic heat conduction ,",
    "the subcluster plasma is heated by the ambient hot plasma and evaporates rapidly , because heat is conducted from the ambient plasma to the cold subcluster plasma .",
    "thus , the sharp front of the temperature distribution disappears .",
    "we also carried out simulations that included the saturation effects of heat flux , and we confirmed that the effects are negligible . in model mc ,",
    "the heat conduction and plasma diffusion across the front are suppressed because the magnetic field lines are parallel to the cold front .",
    "the x - ray intensity distribution in model mc shows a steeper gradient at the leading edge of the subcluster than that in model hc .",
    "the numerically obtained x - ray intensity distribution of model mc reproduces the overall structures of x - ray intensity observed in a3667 . at @xmath68 , the magnetic field strength near the front increases by a factor of 8 , and",
    "@xmath70 decreases by a factor of 100 from the initial state . in this model",
    ", the lifetime of the cold front is more than @xmath71 .",
    "numerical results also reproduced the bow shock upstream of the cold front .",
    "the interaction between the inflowing hot ambient plasma and the cold subcluster plasma drives another shock propagating inside the subcluster .",
    "this shock is located at @xmath72 in the upper panels of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the shock propagating inside the subcluster initially smears the cold front by shock heating .",
    "subsequently , adiabatic expansion following the shock compression cools the subcluster plasma .",
    "this cold plasma is pulled back by gravity and the cold front is recovered .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the temperature distribution at @xmath68 in models m ( left ) and h ( right ) . in these models ,",
    "heat conduction is not included . by comparing model h with hc",
    ", we confirm that when the magnetic field does not exist , cold fronts can be maintained only if the heat conductivity is small enough .",
    "the results of model h indicate that the k - h instability grows at the contact discontinuity between the cold , dense subcluster plasma and the hot , less - dense ambient plasma .",
    "the growth of the k - h instability is not prominent near the stagnation point @xmath73 , but the k - h vortices grow around @xmath74 .",
    "the k - h instability does not disrupt the cold front , because the velocity difference inside and outside of the contact surface is small in the upstream side of the dense subcluster . in model m ,",
    "the magnetic tension force along the front suppresses the k - h instability , even in the sides of the dense subcluster , where the velocity shear is large . except for this stability for the k - h instability ,",
    "the numerical results of model m are similar to these of model h.      figure [ fig4 ] shows the results of model mtc , in which we initially assumed disordered magnetic fields .",
    "the top and bottom panels show the time evolution of the density and temperature distributions at @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , respectively .",
    "the white curves and arrows show the magnetic field lines and velocity vectors , respectively .",
    "numerical results show that the tangled magnetic field lines in the vicinity of the front are compressed and stretched along the front .",
    "the temperature distributions show that heat is conducted along the tangled field lines . as a result , the low - temperature subcluster plasma is heated and diffuses along the field lines .",
    "since the tangled magnetic field lines are stretched along the front , suppression of heat conduction across the field lines enables the existence of cold fronts .",
    "@xcite carried out hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction of cold subcluster plasma and hot ambient matter .",
    "they suggested that a cold front can be formed after the passage of shock waves through the subcluster plasma , when the cold plasma , initially pushed forward by the shock , falls back .",
    "however , in their simulations heat conduction and magnetic fields were neglected . in this letter",
    ", we presented the results of numerical simulations which included both magnetic fields and heat conduction .",
    "we confirmed that , since the spitzer conductivity is very large in hot ambient plasma , cold fronts can not be maintained longer than @xmath78 , unless the heat conduction across the front is suppressed by the magnetic fields .",
    "we also carried out numerical simulations which included heat conduction starting from the same initial condition as @xcite .",
    "we found that , when we adopt the spitzer conductivity , the subcluster evaporates rapidly and the cold front is not formed . when we included magnetic fields and the effects of anisotropic heat conduction , the numerical results resembled heinz s results .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , after the passage of shock waves , the cold plasma pulled back by gravity helps sharpen the cold front .    in ",
    "[ sec : m ] , we presented numerical results that showed the k - h instability does not grow near the cold front , because the velocity of inflowing plasmas is reduced after the plasmas pass through the bow shock . in the magnetohydrodynamical models ,",
    "the magnetic fields , which stretched along the contact surface , also stabilized the k - h instability .",
    "thus , the k - h instability does not threaten the existence of cold fronts .    in  [ sec : mtc ] we showed results of a model with initially disordered magnetic fields .",
    "numerical results show that the magnetic fields near the front are gradually stretched .",
    "thus , the initially tangled magnetic field lines become parallel to the front and suppress the heat conduction across the front .",
    "we confirmed the suggestion by @xcite that the stretching of turbulent intergalactic magnetic fields enables the maintenance of cold fronts .",
    "if the scale of magnetic turbulence is smaller than the mean free path , heat can be conducted almost isotropically .",
    "the heat conductivity in such a turbulent mhd medium is as large as @xmath79 of the spitzer value @xcite and still large enough to diffuse out the cold front .",
    "we expect that coherent fluid motions and the stretching of the magnetic fields along the cold front increase the coherent length of field lines and make that region less turbulent .",
    "let us now discuss the three - dimensional ( 3d ) effects .",
    "since magnetic fields compressed in front of the cold front can expand in the third direction , the strength of the magnetic fields in this region will be reduced in 3d .",
    "however , even such weakened magnetic fields suppress the heat conduction across them .",
    "thus , we expect that cold fronts can be sustained even in 3d .",
    "we hope to report the results of such 3d mhd simulations in subsequent papers .    in this letter",
    ", we assumed that the ambient plasma has magnetic fields .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out the possibility that magnetic fields are spontaneously generated by the ramani - laval instability around the cold front .",
    "such magnetic fields can also help to suppress the heat conduction across the front .",
    "we thank t. hanawa , s. miyaji , n. okabe , m. hattori , and u. fujita for their discussions .",
