    "in the last decade brane - world models , originally motivated @xcite - rs2 by string / m - theory , have developed into classical theories of gravitation , alternative to general relativity and reducing to it in a well - defined limit . in these models our observable universe is a co - dimension one brane with tension @xmath1 embedded in a 5-dimensional ( 5d ) bulk and gravitation has more degrees of freedom than in general relativity . the fifth dimension is not compactified , as in the kaluza - klein theories , but instead curved , in the simplest case due to a bulk cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "cosmological generalizations of the randall - sundrum ( rs ) second model @xcite consist of a moving friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) brane embedded into a static schwarzschild - anti de sitter bulk .",
    "cosmological dynamics is given by the motion of the brane in the bulk .",
    "our homogeneous and isotropic universe certainly contains local inhomogeneities . in principle , these can be dealt with the perturbation theory on the flrw brane . however , due mainly to technical problems involving the boundary conditions to be imposed @xcite , maartenslr this is not a completed task for the moment .",
    "there is still much to learn until a complete perturbative description will be achieved . in order to get some insight into how the inhomogeneities could affect the cosmological evolution on the brane , exact toy models are worth to study .",
    "this method has a great tradition from the early days of general relativity : in the simplest , einstein - straus ( swiss - cheese ) model @xcite , in which schwarzschild spheres of constant comoving radius are glued into the flrw space - time , the luminosity - redshift relation is modified as compared to the flrw universe @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of brane - world models being much more complicated , the question arises , whether similar solutions can be found . a first investigation in @xcite although presents the correct form of the junction conditions between the schwarzschild and flrw brane regions , due to an error reaches the wrong conclusion that no such brane - worlds exist",
    "in reality , the conclusion holds only in a static setup , while dynamical swiss - cheese brane - worlds do exist .",
    "( this is pointed out in the published erratum ) .",
    "the simplest such brane - world model was later presented in @xcite . in this model",
    ", schwarzschild voids are immersed in an evolving flrw brane with flat spatial sections @xmath3 and cosmological constant @xmath4 .",
    "this swiss - cheese brane is embedded symmetrically into the bulk .",
    "the bulk for this swiss - cheese brane has a complicated structure .",
    "while the flrw brane can be embedded into a 5d anti de sitter ( ads5 ) bulk , the same does not apply for the schwarzschild regions .",
    "indeed the perturbative analysis of the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric source in the weak field limit , when the bulk is the ads5 space - time , has shown corrections scaling as @xmath5 to the schwarzschild potential @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore the schwarzschild brane black hole ( showing no correction to the schwarzschild potential by definition ) is not embeddible into ads5 .",
    "rather the schwarzschild black holes extend as black strings into the bulk @xcite .",
    "gravity wave perturbations of such a black - string brane - world were recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite may cause the decay of the black string into a black cigar @xcite , but it has also been shown that under very mild assumptions , classical event horizons can not pinch off horowitzmaeda .",
    "the swiss - cheese type brane structure thus emerges of black strings / cigars penetrating a cosmological brane .",
    "the bulk contains transition zones between the black string / cigar regions and the ads5 bulk regions ( fig [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "1 cm   1 cm    the evolution of the scale factor in this model surprisingly proceeds as in general relativity : the swiss - cheese brane  with @xmath3 forever expands and forever decelerates . at a technical level , this happens because the non - vanishing source terms in the effective einstein equation combine into an effective dust @xcite , re - establishing formally the general relativistic einstein - straus model with the effective dust source . at a more general level",
    "this means that the motion of the brane in the ads5 bulk is not affected by the inhomogeneities introduced by the puncturing black strings .",
    "however the cosmological fluid on the brane evolves in a different way in the presence of inhomogeneities . due to the quadratic source term two branches of evolution",
    "emerge , one of them physical , with positive energy density @xmath6 . at early times of the cosmological evolution ,",
    "when the quadratic term dominates , the energy density is less than in the general relativistic case and a negative pressure ( tension ) @xmath7 characterizes the cosmological fluid . for @xmath8 and",
    "after the quadratic source term becomes subdominant , the cosmological fluid evolves asymptotically into the einstein - straus dust .",
    "the energy density becomes indistinguishable from the general relativistic value and the tension disappears .",
    "interesting situations occur , whenever @xmath9 .",
    "with increasing @xmath10 , the evolution of the cosmological fluid changes dramatically.for high enough values of @xmath4 the fluid evolves into a pressure singularity , resembling a sudden future singularity @xcite , however here the scale factor @xmath11 and all of its derivatives stay regular .",
    "this unpleasant behaviour of the fluid can be evaded by redefining the pressure and energy density on the cosmological brane regions in such a way that they absorb @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this redefinition generalizes a similar procedure in general relativity .",
    "the simple swiss - cheese brane - world model presented in @xcite can be generalized in many ways .",
    "one possibility would be to allow for brane black hole solutions with tidal charge , known both in a static @xcite and in the rotating stationary axisymmetric case @xcite .",
    "another possibility is by allowing for an asymmetric embedding of the brane . while both in the original rs model and in some of its curved generalizations the symmetry of the embedding is assumed , such that the brane is the moving boundary of the bulk , there are many attempts to lift this symmetry , as interesting new features emerge , like a late - time acceleration ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "an asymmetric embedding can arise from different black hole masses on the two sides on the brane kraus , @xcite , @xcite , different cosmological constants on the left and right side of the brane @xcite , @xcite or from both @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric embedding in brane - worlds was discussed covariantly in @xcite and in the presence of induced gravity and gauss - bonnet contributions in @xcite and deruelle , @xcite , respectively .    in line with the above mentioned references ,",
    "in this paper we propose to discuss _ asymmetrically embedded swiss - cheese brane - worlds_. in the simplest case the asymmetry is achieved by choosing different values of the bulk cosmological constant in the left and right ads5 regions in which the flrw regions of the brane are embedded .",
    "the bulk extension of any schwarzschild void is left symmetric , therefore the black string / cigar metric is not altered with respect to the symmetric case presented in ref .",
    "it is reasonable to assume then that the shape of the transition regions connecting the black string / cigar regions to the left or right ads5 regions is parity - dependent ( see fig fig0 ) .",
    "the boundaries of these transition regions should be set such that the junction conditions in the bulk are satisfied .",
    "the basic dynamical equation in asymmetrically embedded brane - worlds is an effective einstein equation ( derived in @xcite as a generalization of the result of @xcite ) : @xmath12the 4-dimensional ( 4d ) and 5d gravitational coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 are related as @xmath15 and an overbar denotes the average taken over the two sides of the brane .",
    "the source term @xmath16 ( generating in special cases a comoving mass and a bulk pressure @xcite , @xcite ) arises from non - standard model bulk fields , like scalar , dilaton , moduli or quantum radiation fields . for simplicity",
    "we choose @xmath17 .",
    "we also drop the electric part of the weyl curvature @xmath18 of the bulk , motivated by the existence of stable black string solutions with vanishing electric part of the weyl curvature in the two - brane models of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the flrw regions are filled with a perfect fluid @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the comoving time , @xmath21 and @xmath22 the 3-metric with constant curvature of the spatial hypersurfaces @xmath23=const ) , which induces the quadratic source term @xmath24 \\ .",

    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we discuss the evolution of the scale factor in this asymmetric swiss - cheese brane - world as derived from the junction conditions on the brane .",
    "for @xmath3 we show that the asymmetry does not modify the cosmological evolution .",
    "this occurs exactly as in the symmetric case ( which in turn is the cosmological evolution of the einstein - straus model ) .",
    "therefore the evolution of @xmath6 and @xmath7 has to change .    in section 3",
    "we study the evolution of the fluid .",
    "compared to the symmetric case , the two branches of the symmetric swiss - cheese model split into four .",
    "this happens , because both source terms @xmath28 , @xmath29 , while @xmath30 , therefore yielding to a quartic polynomial in the effective source .",
    "the higher the asymmetry , the more important are the induced modifications as compared to the symmetric case . in order to quantify this",
    ", we define a properly chosen dimensionless asymmetry parameter @xmath31 .",
    "then we show that for any @xmath32 @xmath33 ( including @xmath8 ) there is a _ critical value _",
    "@xmath34 , which separates cosmologies with pressure singularities from those with regular evolution during the whole lifetime of the universe .",
    "we find that ( i ) pressure singularities can appear even when @xmath8 , provided the asymmetry in the embedding is high ( ii ) pressure singularities are generic for @xmath35 . while in the symmetric case there was a single branch allowing for positive energy density , in the asymmetric case there are two .",
    "we study the domains of positivity of the energy density on these two branches .",
    "then we illustrate graphically various typical behaviors of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in section 4",
    "we discuss in detail the models with @xmath8 , which can be obtained after a suitable redefinition of the fluid variables , as proven in ref .",
    "@xcite . in subsection",
    "4.a we illustrate the critical behavior of the swiss - cheese brane - world models with asymmetry by plotting the evolution of the four branches of energy density as function of both time and asymmetry parameter . as @xmath8 is chosen , the pressure singularity ( coming together with the ill - definedness of the energy density ) arises as an exclusive consequence of the asymmetric embedding . in subsection",
    "4.b we introduce the _ pressure singularity censorship _ conjecture .",
    "this sets limits on the allowable degree of asymmetry in the model .",
    "we show that with the highest established lower limit for the brane tension , @xmath36 can be of the order of the individual values of the bulk cosmological constant @xmath37 on the two sides of the brane .",
    "thus in particular the pressure singularity censorship can be satisfied with ads5 on one side of the brane and minkowski bulk on the other if the brane tension is high enough .     in section 5",
    "we estimate the energy scale for which the asymmetry becomes important during cosmological evolution .",
    "we find that in order to satisfy both the nucleosynthesis constraints and the pressure singularity censorship , the minimal value of @xmath1  derived from the nucleosynthesis constraints has to be supplemented by a @xmath0 times larger maximal value .",
    "it is a generic feature , independent of the swiss - cheese model considered here that the asymmetry source term of the friedmann equation generated by different bulk cosmological constants bounds the brane tension from above .",
    "finally we analyze the degree of asymmetry and the likelihood of a cosmological evolution running into a pressure singularity in our universe .",
    "section 6 contains the concluding remarks .",
    "it is natural to assume ( at least for flat spatial sections of the flrw brane ) that the inhomogeneities represented by schwarzschild voids will not evolve in other ways but only due to the expansion of the surrounding cosmological fluid .",
    "this assumption renders the junction surface at constant comoving radius .",
    "the junction conditions on spheres of constant comoving radius @xmath38 at the interface of schwarzschild and flrw regions @xcite for @xmath39 reduce to @xcite:@xmath40here @xmath20 is cosmological time , with the origin at the big bang and @xmath41 the mass of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this result does not depend on the symmetric or asymmetric character of the embedding .",
    "rather , it depends on choosing flat spatial sections for the flrw space - time and on assuming no electric weyl source on the brane .",
    "as the flrw regions are homogeneous and isotropic , the evolution ( [ atau ] ) derived for the junction surfaces should hold for the whole flrw part of the brane .",
    "irrespective of the degree of asymmetry , the swiss - cheese brane - world is expanding and decelerating in precisely the same way as it would be in the symmetric case .",
    "cosmological evolution in the flrw regions is governed by the friedmann and raychaudhuri equations . for an asymmetric embedding they are @xcite:@xmath42   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\kappa ^{2}\\lambda ^{3}\\left ( 4\\rho + 3p+\\lambda \\right ) \\alpha } { % 6\\left ( \\rho + \\lambda \\right ) ^{3}}\\ ,   \\label{raych}\\end{aligned}\\]]where",

    "the asymmetry still compatible with a regular evolution of the fluid increases up to the limiting value@xmath186    thus for each @xmath1 an upper limit for the asymmetry in the bulk cosmological constant can be set such that the evolution of the cosmological fluid stays regular .",
    "this upper limit can be no higher than @xmath187 of the value of @xmath188 .",
    "the source terms in the friedmann equation ( [ fried ] ) compare as @xmath189 .",
    "this friedmann equation is model independent , as long as we do not specify the evolution of the scale - factor .",
    "clearly , deviations from the general relativistic evolution appear when the third ( quadratic ) and fourth ( asymmetry ) terms , respectively are comparable with the second . this qualitative estimate shows that the quadratic source term is subdominant while @xmath190 , while the asymmetry source term is subdominant while @xmath191holds .",
    "the polynomial on the left hand side has two complex and one real root:@xmath192{\\frac{\\alpha } { 4}+\\sqrt{\\frac{% \\alpha ^{2}}{16}+\\frac{\\alpha } { 54}}+\\frac{1}{27}}}+\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\alpha } { 4% } + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha ^{2}}{16}+\\frac{\\alpha } { 54}}+\\frac{1}{27}}-\\allowbreak   \\frac{2}{3}\\ , \\]]the latter increasing monotonically with @xmath31 from @xmath193 for no asymmetry and @xmath194 for the maximally allowed @xmath195 .",
    "the interpretation is , that without asymmetry , @xmath196 can be arbitrarily high , while any asymmetry bounds from above the range of allowed brane tensions .",
    "the energy density of the background photons at the beginning of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is @xmath197j m@xmath161 , which in units @xmath149 becomes @xmath198mev@xmath148 .",
    "thus @xmath199 .",
    "in order to have the bbn constraints satisfied on the asymmetric brane an upper bound also exists . for the maximally",
    "allowed asymmetry @xmath34 , this gives @xmath200 mev@xmath148 , ten times the lower limit .",
    "nevertheless , during cosmological evolution the asymmetry term tends to a constant value @xmath201 .",
    "such a constant behaves as @xmath10 , however has a different interpretation .",
    "according to current cosmological observations there is approximately twice as much dark energy in the universe , then matter , thus @xmath202 ( the latter being the matter energy density today , which also includes dark matter ) . in consequence",
    "@xmath203 kg / m@xmath204 , which in units @xmath149 becomes @xmath205 mev@xmath148 .",
    "with @xmath206 we see that the degree of asymmetry imposed for our universe regarded as a brane @xmath207 is far below the limit @xmath34 , thus ( a ) in our universe there is in practice no upper bound for @xmath1 and ( b ) no pressure singularity will occur due to the imposed asymmetric swiss - cheese structure .    based on the above numerical estimates , at the end of this section we comment on the likelihood that the swiss - cheese universe evolves into a pressure singularity due to @xmath4 alone . by switching off the asymmetry ( thus @xmath208 ) , eq .",
    "( [ alphacrit ] ) gives the minimal value of the cosmological constant for which the pressure singularity would appear .",
    "this is @xmath209with the numerical values discussed earlier @xmath210 emerges in the cosmological regions of the brane , regardless of which of the limits @xmath211 is chosen .",
    "thus our universe could not evolve into a pressure singularity due to @xmath212  either .    the swiss - cheese brane - world model applied for our universe",
    "gives a cosmology with inhomogeneities and regular evolution , standing very close to the general relativistic behaviour .",
    "on such a brane , essential deviations from the general relativistic evolution could arise only well before the bbn . at the formation of the first stars ( the end of dark ages ) , when the use of the swiss - cheese model becomes meaningful , both the evolution of the scale factor and of the fluid variables are almost identical as in the general relativistic einstein - straus model .",
    "therefore our universe can exist as an asymmetrically embedded swiss - cheese brane - world .",
    "in this paper we have discussed brane cosmological models with local inhomogeneities ( swiss - cheese brane ) in which the brane is embedded asymmetrically into the bulk .",
    "the asymmetry is generated by different cosmological constants in the left and right anti de sitter bulk regions .",
    "as the junction conditions on the brane are unchanged by the embedding of the brane , the evolution of the scale factor proceeds exactly as in the symmetric case ( given explicitly , both in ref .",
    "@xcite and here , for branes with inhomogeneities represented by schwarzschild black holes and flrw regions with flat spatial sections ) .",
    "the cosmological evolution in fact proceeds as in the general relativistic einstein - straus model , which forever expands and decelerates .",
    "the reason is that the totality of source terms ( including the asymmetry source term @xmath213 ) in the effective einstein equation ( [ modegen ] ) add up to an effective dust source with @xmath214establishing a formal equivalence with the general relativistic einstein - straus model .    due to the modifications induced by asymmetry in the friedmann and raychaudhuri equations ,",
    "the evolution of the fluid in the asymmetric brane - world scenario is however changed . in the symmetric case",
    "the modifications were caused by the source term quadratic in the energy - momentum .",
    "as consequence of this quadratic source term , two branches @xmath215 emerged ( one of them with positive energy density ) . with a cosmological constant @xmath4 in the flrw regions of the brane",
    ", the fluid could evolve into a pressure singularity in spite of the regular evolution of the scale factor . this unphysical pressure singularity ( and also the evolution into negative energy density )",
    "could be conveniently avoided by a proper redefinition of the energy density and pressure of the fluid swisscheese such that the new fluid variables absorb the difference in the brane cosmological constants .",
    "the asymmetry between the left and right bulk regions further splits up the possible evolutions of the fluid . with asymmetry , there are four possible branches @xmath134 .",
    "only two of them allow for positive energy density and only one of them has well defined limit in the symmetric case . in certain",
    "parameter range the evolution of the fluid is regular and approaches at late times the einstein - straus universe filled with dust .",
    "however with increasing degree of asymmetry in the left and right bulk cosmological constants , the fluid can evolve into an unphysical negative energy density and / or a pressure singularity , while the scale factor stays regular .",
    "this can happen even if @xmath8 is chosen , due entirely to the asymmetry in the embedding .",
    "based on the analysis of this paper and of ref .",
    "@xcite , we conclude that pressure singularities could appear as consequence of the difference of the cosmological constants either between the vacuum and flrw regions ( symmetric case ) or between the left and right bulk regions with respect to the brane ( asymmetric case ) . when both are present , as a rule , we have seen that asymmetry speeds up the evolution into a pressure singularity .    for generic values of @xmath4",
    "we have introduced a _ critical value _",
    "@xmath34 of a suitably defined asymmetry parameter , given by eq .",
    "( [ alphacrit ] ) , which separates swiss - cheese brane - worlds with and without pressure singularities .",
    "we have also analyzed whether such pressure singularities occur in universes similar to ours . by carefully examining the various lower bounds on the brane tension we have proved that the observed value of the cosmological constant is much less than the minimal value of @xmath4 necessary for pressure singularity occurrence in the symmetric case .    in the asymmetric case",
    "we have imposed the _ pressure singularity censorship_. this conjecture bounds the possible degree of asymmetry . for the smallest brane tension @xmath1 obeying all known constraints , the asymmetry in the bulk cosmological constant can be at most @xmath216 . with higher values of @xmath1 the asymmetry can further increase up to @xmath217 without jeopardizing the regular evolution of the fluid .",
    "we have shown that the nucleosynthesis constraints restrict the brane tension not only from below , as well - known , but also from above , due to the asymmetry source term . the upper bound decreases with @xmath1 . with the highest asymmetry allowed by the pressure singularity censorship ,",
    "the upper bound for the brane tension is @xmath0 times the lower bound .",
    "however for our universe present cosmological observations restrict the value of @xmath31 much below the critical value .",
    "therefore the upper bound is @xmath143 for all practical purposes and the evolution of the fluid on the swiss - cheese brane representing our universe stays regular . with the upper limit for @xmath1 very high ,",
    "the astrophysical lower limit for @xmath196 can also be obeyed , thus the brane - world universe with the cosmological constant completely replaced by the asymmetry source term can also accommodate compact objects , like neutron stars .",
