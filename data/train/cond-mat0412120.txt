    "a deep connection between glass transition in molecular glass formers , structural arrest in colloidal systems , and jamming transition in granular media @xcite has often been stressed in the past few years . in spite of the fact that these systems are very different one from each other , varying suitably the control parameters , a slowdown and a subsequent structural arrest in a solid - like disordered state are found in each of them . in @xcite a possible phase diagram for jamming",
    "is suggested , which takes into account the fact that jamming is obtained either raising the volume fraction or lowering the temperature or lowering the applied stress .",
    "colloidal suspensions and molecular glass formers are both thermal systems , and it is commonly accepted that both colloidal glass transition and molecular glass transition are of the same type despite of the fact that different control parameters may drive the transition .",
    "the case of granular materials is instead very different : they are athermal systems , since the thermal fluctuations are significantly less than the gravitational energy and the system can not explore the phase space without any external driving .",
    "nevertheless an exceedingly slowing down is observed when a granular material is shaken at low shaking amplitude , or flows under a low shear stress , with strong analogies with the slowing down observed in glass formers .",
    "experimental and numerical studies @xcite have confirmed this connection , however its precise nature is still unclear @xcite .    in the present paper in order to study this connection we apply a statistical mechanics approach to granular media .",
    "this approach , which has been extensively developed in previous works @xcite , is based on an elaboration of the original ideas suggested by edwards @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption is that for a granular system subject to an external drive ( e. g. tapping ) , after having reached stationarity , time averages coincide with suitable ensemble averages over the  mechanically stable \" states .",
    "we have shown @xcite that this assumption works for different lattice models namely that a generalized gibbs distribution of the stable states describes with good approximation the stationary state attained by the system under tapping dynamics . here each tap consists in raising the bath temperature to a finite value ( called tap amplitude ) and , after a lapse of time ( called tap duration ) quenching the bath temperature back to zero . by cyclically repeating the process",
    "the system explores the space of the mechanically stable states .",
    "we thus consider one of the above lattice model for which the statistical mechanics approach works .",
    "the model is made up of hard spheres under gravity",
    ". then we apply standard statistical mechanics methods in order to investigate analytically the existence and the nature of a possible jamming transition .",
    "more precisely we consider the bethe - peierls approximation using the cavity method @xcite : by changing the control parameter a phase transition from a fluid to a crystal is found , and , when crystallization is avoided , a glassy phase appears .",
    "the nature of this glassy phase is analogous to that found in mean field models for glass formers @xcite : in particular we observe a dynamical transition , where an exponentially high number of metastable states appears , and at a lower temperature a thermodynamic discontinuous phase transition to a glassy state .",
    "a brief account of these calculations was given in a previous letter @xcite .",
    "we also studied @xcite the model in @xmath0 by means of numerical simulations , and we found that the model under taps has a transition from a fluid to a crystal , in a very good agreement with he mean field approximation .",
    "however the numerical simulation was not suitable to study the glass transition since the model showed a strong tendency towards crystallization .",
    "for this reason we study here a variant of the model @xcite which has the virtue of avoiding crystallization .",
    "we find that the system under gravity evolved by monte carlo taps presents features characteristic of real granular media @xcite , and at low tap amplitudes a dynamical transition with properties recalling those of usual glass formers .",
    "in particular we observe a dynamical non linear susceptibility with a maximum at increasing time : this behavior , typical of glass formers , is usually interpreted as the sign of dynamic heterogeneities in the system .    in conclusions",
    "the results confirm early speculations about the deep connection between the jamming transition in granular media and the glass transition in usual glass formers , giving moreover a precise interpretation to its nature . in sect .",
