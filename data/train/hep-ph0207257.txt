    "<S> we present a method for measuring the weak phase @xmath0 using isospin analysis of three body @xmath1 decays into @xmath2 channels . </S>",
    "<S> differential decay widths and time dependent asymmetry in @xmath3 mode needs to be measured into even isospin @xmath4 states . </S>",
    "<S> the method can be used to extract @xmath0 , as well as , the size of the electroweak penguin contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is free from assumptions like su(3 ) or neglect of any contributions to the decay amplitudes . by studying different regions of the dalitz plot , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to reduce the ambiguity in the value of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> time dependent measurements of asymmetries of decay modes of @xmath5 into @xmath6 eigenstates @xcite are very useful in determining angles of the unitarity triangle . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is particularly significant , since weak phases can be extracted without any theoretical uncertainty from modes whose amplitudes have a single weak phase . </S>",
    "<S> the time dependent @xmath6 asymmetry in the golden mode @xmath7 , thus yields information on @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this method has proved successful in the measurement of @xmath9 @xcite , which is in good agreement @xcite with theoretical estimates .    </S>",
    "<S> measurement of other angles using modes like @xmath10 , are beset with theoretical uncertainties because the amplitude gets contributions from tree and penguin diagrams which have different dependence on weak phases . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the theory error can in principle be removed using the method of gronau and london ( gl )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method relies on the assumption of isospin invariance and the fact that the amplitude for @xmath11 gets contributions only from the tree diagrams ( barring a small contribution from the electroweak penguin ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method will lead to a measurement of @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is widely believed that @xmath0 can not be measured using the time dependent techniques developed to measure the phases @xmath13 and @xmath14 . as an alternative , </S>",
    "<S> several other methods have been developed  @xcite to measure this weak phase . while @xmath0 can be measured cleanly using some of these techniques at a later date , techniques  @xcite assuming flavor su(3 ) , are expected to provide the first estimates of angle @xmath0 .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a method , which uses time dependent asymmetry in the three body @xmath2 decay mode of the @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our technique is on almost as good a footing as the gronau - london method , and relies on construction of triangles based on isospin analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the extra ingredient that we use is that the tree and the electroweak penguin pieces of the weak hamiltonian responsible for @xmath15 transition have the same strong phase because of the operator structure of the interaction in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> however , the method is free from approximations such as su(3 ) symmetry , neglect of annihilation or rescattering contributions . </S>",
    "<S> further , our method is sensitive to the relative weak phase between the tree and penguin contribution , and as such will probe new physics . </S>",
    "<S> recently , several three body non charmed decay modes of @xmath1 meson have been observed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the branching ratios of the modes @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been measured @xcite to be around @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , even with limited statistics , a dalitz plot analysis has been performed and quasi two body final states have been identified .    </S>",
    "<S> the three body decay modes such as @xmath19 provide valuable information that can pin down the phases in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> importance of these modes was first pointed out by lipkin , nir , quinn and snyder ( lnqs)@xcite , however , their analysis did not incorporate the large electroweak penguin effects known to be present in these decays@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these decays are described by six independent isospin amplitudes @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for the transition isospin , and describes the transformation of the weak hamiltonian under isospin and can take only the values 0 and 1 in the standard model ; @xmath22 is the isospin of the pion pair and takes the value 0 , 1 , and 2 and @xmath23 is the final isospin and can take the values @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> even values of @xmath22 has the pair of pions in a symmetric state , and thus have even angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> similarly states with @xmath22 odd must be odd under the exchange of two pions . </S>",
    "<S> a separation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 should be possible through a study of the dalitz plot .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider only the @xmath28 and 2 channels in this paper , and these are described by the three amplitudes @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes for the various decay modes with @xmath32 , obey useful isospin relations . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to derive the following @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 the subscript even represents the isospin of the @xmath4 system . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ iso - relations ] ) implies the following two isospin triangles relations : @xmath35 and also implies the relation , @xmath36 decays corresponding to conjugate processes will obey similar relations . the iso - triangle represented by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ neutral - triangle ] ) and its conjugate are the ones that interest us .    the decay @xmath37 , ( where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the four momentum of the @xmath1 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively ) may be described in terms of the usual mandelstam variables @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> states with @xmath26 must be symmetric under the exchange @xmath48 . in what follows we </S>",
    "<S> shall be concerned with differential decay rates @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> these can be extracted from the dalitz plot of the three body decays . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if states with @xmath50 are selected , they will be automatically symmetric in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed angular analysis will of course permit extraction of even isospin @xmath4 events and offer a larger sample . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath51 mode being symmetric in pions , always has pions in isospin even state .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we define the amplitudes @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 corresponding to the modes @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it may be understood that all observables , amplitudes and strong phases depend on the the two independent mandelstam variables @xmath58 and @xmath59 , even though we suppress explicitly stating the ` @xmath58 ' and ` @xmath59 ' dependence . </S>",
    "<S> these amplitudes may be expressed as follows , purely based on ckm @xcite contributions : @xmath60 the magnitudes @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 actually contain all possible contributions ( tree , color - suppressed , annihilation , w - exchange , penguin , penguin - annihilation and electroweak - penguin amplitudes ) and include the magnitudes of the ckm elements . </S>",
    "<S> their explicit composition is irrelevant for this analysis , except for the fact that the isospin 3/2 amplitude @xmath54 can not get contributions from gluonic penguins . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , corresponding to the conjugate process @xmath70 can be written similarly with the weak phase @xmath0 replaced by @xmath71 . in the presence of two contributions to the amplitude as described in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : amps ] ) and ( [ eq : amps2 ] ) , the direct asymmetry is non - vanishing . </S>",
    "<S> the time dependent @xmath6 asymmetry for @xmath72 then has the form , @xmath73 where @xmath74    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] depicts the two triangles formed by the amplitudes @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 and the corresponding conjugate amplitudes in isospin space , along with the relative orientations and defines the angles used in the derivations . the relative phase between @xmath75 and @xmath67 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath76 ) , defined as @xmath77 , </S>",
    "<S> can be obtained from the coefficient of the @xmath78 piece in the time dependent @xmath6 asymmetry for the mode @xmath79 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is defined as @xmath82 note that this measurement involves time dependent asymmetry in the partial decay rate @xmath83 at a fixed @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> again , events symmetric in @xmath84 need to be selected in the dalitz plot .    </S>",
    "<S> the isospin triangles formed by the @xmath19 amplitudes , as represented in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ neutral - triangle ] ) and that for the corresponding conjugate processes . only one orientation of the conjugate triangle is depicted , this triangle could have been flipped around the base @xmath85 . ]    with the knowledge of @xmath13 , the angle @xmath77 may be regarded as an observable . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , measurement of six partial decay rates @xmath86 , @xmath83 and @xmath87 as well as their conjugates at the same @xmath58 and @xmath59 as used for @xmath88 determination , now allows us to construct the two triangles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] with two fold ambiguity . from the figure </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the angle @xmath89 between @xmath54 and @xmath69 is related to @xmath77 as , @xmath90 the ` plus  minus ' sign ambiguity in the above reflects the possibility of same  side or opposite  side orientation of the triangles . once @xmath91 is known , it is possible to determine @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial additional information necessary is the observation of neubert and rosner@xcite that the electroweak penguin operators @xmath92 and @xmath93 are fierz - equivalent to the operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the isospin @xmath25 amplitude @xmath54 is symmetric in the two pions @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , within the standard model ( sm ) only the operator @xmath97 with coefficient @xmath98 $ ] contributes , while the operator @xmath99 does not . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude @xmath54 thus has a common strong phase @xmath100 arising from the same quark operator . </S>",
    "<S> this phase @xmath101 may be set equal to zero by convention .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath102 may be written as @xcite , @xmath103 here , @xmath104 where @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath91 is then given by @xmath106 since the angle @xmath107 is determined , it follows that angle @xmath0 is now calculable from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gp ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that we can determine @xmath0 without having to use the theoretically computed value of @xmath108 , given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dew ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show below , @xmath0 can be determined cleanly by relying only on the neubert - rosner observation that the amplitude @xmath54 has a single common strong phase . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the observation of a common strong phase @xmath101 is based on very firm grounds within the frame work of the standard model ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> it relies essentially , only on isospin and the operator structures contributing within the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , an experimentally verifiable consequence of this hypothesis would be the vanishing of direct cp - violating asymmetry for the mode @xmath109 .    using the amplitudes @xmath52 , @xmath67 , @xmath53 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 one can construct a maximum of seven independent observables ( the amplitudes @xmath54 , @xmath110 are not independent as they can be obtained using isospin relations ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two triangles can be completely defined in terms of seven observables , the three sides of each of the triangles and a relative angle between the two triangles . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes under consideration involve the following eleven variables : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these variables are connected by two isospin relations ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ neutral - triangle ] ) and the corresponding relation for the conjugate process ) , which results in four constraints , reducing the number of independent variables to seven , as we will illustrate below . hence , all variables including @xmath0 , can be determined purely in terms of observables .    in order to determine @xmath0 , we express all the amplitudes and strong phases , in terms of observables and @xmath0 . the variables , @xmath116 and @xmath117 may be solved as a function of @xmath0 and other observables as follows : @xmath118 where @xmath119 defined in analogy to @xmath77 , is the angle between @xmath53 and @xmath68 , and @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are given by , @xmath123 the angle @xmath119 need not be measured but can be determined from geometry of the two triangles . </S>",
    "<S> it is given by @xmath124    we define @xmath125 and @xmath126 , which are conveniently expressed in terms of @xmath0 and observables as : @xmath127}\\\\ \\tan\\delta^{00}&=&\\frac{a_{\\sss \\rm dir}^{00}\\tan\\gamma}{1-y^{00 } [ \\cos2\\theta^{00}-\\sin2\\theta^{00}\\tan\\gamma ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our task now is to express the strong phases @xmath128 and @xmath129 in terms of @xmath0 and observables , just as we have done for the other variables . </S>",
    "<S> one finally intends to solve for @xmath0 , only in terms of observables .    </S>",
    "<S> the isospin triangle relation given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ neutral - triangle ] ) and the similar relation for the conjugate process may be expressed as : @xmath130 using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ iso - triangles ] ) one can derive the ` four ' equations : @xmath131 eqns .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) may be recast as follows : @xmath132 eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) may be used to used to solve for @xmath133 and @xmath134 : @xmath135 squaring and adding eqns .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) we get , @xmath136 now @xmath137 and @xmath138 . hence , </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gamma - eq ] ) is expressed completely in terms of observables and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 can thus be determined cleanly , in terms of observables .    </S>",
    "<S> the ckm phase @xmath0 can be determined simultaneously for several regions of the dalitz plot . </S>",
    "<S> the ambiguities in the solution of @xmath0 may thereby be removed . </S>",
    "<S> having measured @xmath0 one can use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : xi - gamma - rel ] ) to estimate the value of @xmath108 in terms of observables . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus verify our understanding of electroweak penguin contributions </S>",
    "<S> .    one may ask if it is possible to determine @xmath0 using @xmath139 without resorting to the neubert - rosner hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> if one includes in the analysis @xmath140 with the two pions in an isospin odd state , one adds four new variables corresponding to the amplitudes and strong phases of the two parts with different weak phases . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can at best obtain four new independent observables . </S>",
    "<S> three of which , arise from time dependent measurement for this mode , and one results from the interference between states with pions in isospin even and isospin odd . </S>",
    "<S> we hence conclude that it is not possible to determine @xmath0 without at - least one theoretical observation , even if one uses all the information possible from @xmath141 decays .    </S>",
    "<S> current experimental data @xcite indicates that at least two sides of the triangles in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ fig1 ] are readily measurable . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath142 has not yet been observed , the mode @xmath143 has been seen . </S>",
    "<S> hence , using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ iso - rel ] ) the isospin triangle in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ neutral - triangle ] ) can still be constructed . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in future , data from both @xmath142 and @xmath144 modes could be combined to improve statistics .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , the weak phase @xmath0 can be measured using a time dependent asymmetry measurement in the three body decay , @xmath139 . </S>",
