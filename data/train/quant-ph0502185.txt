    "quantum game theory  @xcite is a new field of science having its roots in both game theory and quantum information theory . for about a decade",
    "quantum computer scientists have been searching for new methods of quantum algorithm design .",
    "thorough investigation of different quantum games may bring new insight into the development of quantum algorithms .",
    "it was shown that grover s algorithm @xcite can be treated as an example of a quantum parrondo s paradox @xcite .",
    "operators used in grover s algorithm can be treated as parrondo games having separately zero expected values , however , if they are interwired , the expected value fluctuates .",
    "this effect is well known in grover s algorithm .",
    "implementation of a quantum parrondo s paradox has been described in papers @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a new implementation scheme of a capital - dependent parrondo s paradoxical games on a  relatively small number of qubits .",
    "parrondo s paradox consists of a  sequence of games , where each game can be interpreted as a  toss of an asymmetrical coin .",
    "every success means that the player gains one dollar , every loss means that the player loses one dollar .",
    "there are two games .",
    "game @xmath2 has probability of winning @xmath3 .",
    "game @xmath4 depends on the amount of capital accumulated by player .",
    "if his capital is a  multiple of three , the player tosses coin @xmath5 , which has probability of wining @xmath6 , otherwise the player tosses coin @xmath7 which has probability of wining @xmath8 .",
    "originally @xmath9 , but generally it can be any small real number .    both games @xmath2 and @xmath4 are biased and have negative expected gain .",
    "but when a  player has the option to choose which game he wants to play at each step of the sequence , he can choose such a  combination of games which allows him to  obtain positive expected gain .",
    "it is known that sequences @xmath10 or @xmath11 give relatively high expected gain .",
    "this fact is known as _ parrondo s",
    "in @xcite the quantum versions of parrondo games were proposed .",
    "the scheme introduced in @xcite realizes a  history - dependent version of parrondo s paradox .",
    "its disadvantage is that it needs a  large number of qubits to store the history of the games . on the",
    "other hand the scheme by meyer and blumer @xcite uses brownian motion of particle in one dimension and does not consume large amounts of quantum resources . the scheme presented by flitney , abott and johnson in @xcite",
    "is based on multi - coin discrete quantum history - dependent random walk .",
    "the implementation of the capital - dependent quantum parrondo s paradox introduced in this paper uses only @xmath0 qubits , where @xmath1 is the number of games played .",
    "this allows to perform simulation even when a relatively large number of games are played ; for instance , if a strategy consists of five elementary games then 400 iterations require only 15 qubits .",
    "to implement games @xmath2 and @xmath4 , three arbitrary - chosen one - qubit quantum gates @xmath12 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 are used .",
    "each gate is described by four real parameters and our scheme as a  whole is described by set of parameters :    * @xmath13 : real numbers describing gates @xmath14 ; * @xmath15 : strategy  any sequence of games @xmath2 , @xmath4 ; * @xmath1 : size of @xmath16  outcome register ( see below ) ; * @xmath17 : initial capital offset .",
    "each gate is composed of elementary gates as presented in eq .",
    "( [ equ : gate - comp ] ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and +   @xmath20 .",
    "the quantum register used to perform this scheme consists of three subregisters :    * @xmath21 : one - qubit register representing the coin , * @xmath16 : @xmath1-qubit register storing player s capital , * @xmath22 : three - qubit auxiliary register .",
    "register @xmath21 holds the state of the _",
    "quantum coin_. gates @xmath12 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 acting on this register represent _ quantum coin tosses_. one should note that the register @xmath21 does not store information about history of the games .",
    "after every execution of gates @xmath12 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 , the state of the register @xmath16 is changed according to the result of the _ quantum coin toss_. this register is responsible for storing the history of the games , that is , player s capital .",
    "register @xmath22 is an ancillary register , which one need to check if the state of the @xmath16 register is a multiple of three . at the beginning of the scheme and after the application of the games gates this register is always set to @xmath23 .",
    "games @xmath2 and @xmath4 are implemented using the conditional incrementation ",
    "decrementation ( cid ) gate and gates @xmath12 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 described above .",
    "in addition , game @xmath4 uses gate @xmath24 .    gate @xmath24 sets @xmath25 and @xmath26 registers to state @xmath27 iff the @xmath16 register contains a  number that is a multiple of three : @xmath28    the cid gate is responsible for increasing and decreasing the player s capital . the circuit for this gate is presented in  fig .",
    "[ fig : cid ] .",
    "this gate increments register @xmath16 if @xmath21 is in state @xmath27 and decrements if it is in state @xmath29 .",
    "game @xmath2 is directly implemented by gate @xmath12 as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : game - a ] .",
    "game @xmath4 , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : game - b ] , is more complicated . it uses gate @xmath24 to check if the player s capital is a multiple of three .",
    "if it is the case gate @xmath7 is applied to register @xmath21 , otherwise , @xmath5 is applied .",
    "one can easily check that all gates used in this scheme are unitary because they are composed of elementary unitary operations .",
    "+      the game procedure is composed of the following steps :    1 .",
    "preparation of @xmath21 in state @xmath30 .",
    "2 .   preparation of @xmath16 in state @xmath31 , where @xmath17 is a  small integer number , 3 .",
    "preparation of @xmath32 in @xmath23 state .",
    "4 .   application of gates @xmath12 and @xmath33 in some chosen order @xmath15 .    after each application of gate @xmath12 or",
    "@xmath33 the number stored in register @xmath16 is either incremented or decremented .",
    "the initial state of register @xmath16 must be chosen in such way that integer overflow is avoided .",
    "the maximum number of elementary games can not exceed the capacity of the register @xmath16 .",
    "if our scheme is implemented on a  physical quantum device it should be finalized by measurement .",
    "this would give a  single outcome representing the final capital .",
    "thus , to obtain expected gain , the experiment should be repeated several times .",
    "simulation allows to observe the state vector of the quantum system . using this property",
    "the expected gain is calculated as the average value of @xmath34 in state @xmath35 obtained after tracing out the register with respect to coin and auxiliary subregisters : @xmath36",
    "simulations of a quantum parrondo s paradox presented in this article were performed using qcl @xcite .",
    "the source code of the implementation can be found on the webpage listed in ref .",
    "@xcite .      to carry out the simulation ,",
    "gates @xmath12 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 were prepared with coefficients listed in table   [ tab : ex1 ] .",
    "those coefficients were chosen arbitrarly .",
    ".coefficients of the experiment [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim - res ] the selection of results is presented .",
    "as one can see there are strategies that give positive expected values . for @xmath37 ,",
    "strategy @xmath38 gives a  gain of @xmath39 after 400 steps .",
    "for @xmath40 , strategy @xmath41 gives a  gain of @xmath42 after 400 steps .",
    "+    simulations have shown that finding the winning strategy for a  given initial set of parameters is not trivial because they are uncommon .",
    "we found that the initial value kept in register @xmath16 heavily influences the outcome , for example , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sim - res ] . for different offsets different winning strategies can be found .",
    "one should note that behavior of the strategy can change if the initial offset is altered , for example see , fig .",

    "is wining for @xmath40 and losing for @xmath37 . ]",
    "we have shown that it is possible to create a capital - driven scheme for quantum parrondo games using less than 20 qubits .",
    "the main advantage of this scheme is that the size of the register grows as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of steps .",
