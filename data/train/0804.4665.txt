    "as one of the best examples of a supernova remnant ( snr ) interacting with a molecular cloud ic  443 has been studied over all possible wavelength ranges , from the radio ( see e.g. leahy 2004 ) , through the sub - mm ( van dishoeck et al .",
    "1993 ) to the x - rays ( see e.g. troja et al . 2006 , 2008 ) , including tev @xmath1 emission that is thought to be associated with pulsars ( albert et al . 2007 ;",
    "humesky et al .",
    "2007 ) . at an estimated distance of 1.5 kpc ( welsh & sallmen 2003 ) ,",
    "ic  443 covers approximately a square degree over the sky . until recently because of its relatively large size , most of ic  443 imaging data was a by - product of large sky surveys ( iras , 2mass , rosat , msx , etc ) , and to this date the spectroscopic data only samples a handful of specific regions .",
    "the spectroscopic data , nevertheless , do confirm that the emission arising from ic  443 carries the signature of collisionally excited ( atomic & molecular ) gas , the result of a shock wave impinging on a nearby molecular cloud .",

    "the mips & irs observations are part of our gto program ( rieke pid 77 and houck pid 18 ) to study the physical characteristics of the ejecta from evolved stars .",
    "although the observations were taken very early in the spitzer mission , we have learned a handful of new things on data reduction as to provide the best possible images and spectra .",
    "the mips observations were obtained at three different epochs using fast scan mapping ( 3 sec per frame , 5 pointings per pixel ) , with scan legs offset of 148 \" to sample completely the 70 and 160um arrays .",
    "one of the remarkable features of the mips instrument is its capability to map large areas of the sky in a very efficient way , and therefore the new mips images at 24 , 70 & 160  capture the snr in its entirety ( fig .",
    "the irs observations were carried out using both short and long high resolution modules at 5 fixed cluster positions ( including an off - position ) using 6 and 14sec ramps ( one cycle ) , respectively .",

    "the morphology of the ic  443 is shown in superb detail in the high angular resolution mips images ( standard beam sizes of 6 , 18  and 40  at 24 , 70 & 160  respectively ) .",
    "nevertheless the overall shell morphology can be seen already in the iras images ( fig .",
    "2 top , hires fresco first iteration ; see also braun & strom 1986 ) .",
    "the comparison with h@xmath4 ( a tracer of the ionized gas ) and 24  confirms that a significant fraction of the emission at 24   is due to fine structure atomic and h@xmath0 molecular emission lines , and not necessarily to dust continuum emission from small dust grains .",
    "his conclusion is further supported by the irs spectra ( fig .",
    "3 ) , which show strong [ fe  ii ] 26  and h@xmath0 0 - 0 s(0 ) 28.2  emission lines at the four observed positions , but no detected continuum emission.indeed , except for the south rim of the shell , the 160  emission ( a tracer of cold dust ) does not match the morphology of the hi 1.4ghz emission ( fig .",
    "2 , bottom left ) , suggesting that a large fraction of the emission is not due to dust continuum .",
    "the 2mass ks observations at 2  were interpreted as due to h@xmath0 excitation from shocks ( rho et al .",
    "2001 ) , if this is the case , then is possible that [ c  ii ] 158   contribute to the 160  emission .",
    "certainly [ o  i ] 63  has been detected in several positions across the shell ( rho et al .",
    "2001 ) , and is very likely to contribute significantly to the 70  emission band .",
    "even so , one can use the 70 to 160  ratio to estimate the dust temperature , and at first approximation , we found a range of 18@xmath530 k , with higher dust temperature at the ne , where the h@xmath4 and 24  emission are brighter .",
    "excitation diagrams at positions one ( left ) and four ( right ) based on the three h@xmath0 0 - 0 lines ( 12.23 , 17.03 and 28.22 ) present within the wavelength range of our irs spectra.,title=\"fig : \" ]   excitation diagrams at positions one ( left ) and four ( right ) based on the three h@xmath0 0 - 0 lines ( 12.23 , 17.03 and 28.22 ) present within the wavelength range of our irs spectra.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the irs spectra , as expected from previous work in the nir+mir , contains a handful of atomic fine structure lines from fe , ne and si , plus the h2 pure rotational lines ( fig .",
    "3 , bottom ) .",
    "the most interesting aspect is the obvious differences as a function position in the excitation along the shell .",
    "the standard shock indicator of [ ne  ii ] 12.8  suggests shock velocities ranging from 60 - 90 km / s , and consistent with some previous estimates to account for the emission of the atomic / ionic lines ( rho et al.2001 ) .",
    "finally , the excitation diagrams derived from the three h2 lines covered by the irs observations ( 12.23 , 17.03 and 28.22 ) do also show differences in column densities and temperatures as a function of position , ranging from t@xmath6 k and n@xmath7 @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "4 ) suggesting that the interaction between the shock wave and its environment is non - symmetric .",
