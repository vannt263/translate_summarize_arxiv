    "the answer is that the state of a pair of majorana fermions in a superconducting island depends on the parity of the number of electrons on that island , and it is this dependence on the electrical charge modulo @xmath0 which provides an electromagnetic handle on the majorana s .",

    "this is not a topological quantum computer , since single - qubit rotations of majorana fermions lack topological protection .",

    "<S> we show how to exchange ( braid ) majorana fermions in a network of superconducting nanowires by control over coulomb interactions rather than tunneling . even though majorana fermions are charge - neutral quasiparticles ( equal to their own antiparticle ) , they have an effective long - range interaction through the even - odd electron number dependence of the superconducting ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the flux through a split josephson junction controls this interaction via the ratio of josephson and charging energies , with exponential sensitivity . by switching the interaction on and off in neighboring segments of a josephson junction array </S>",
    "<S> , the non - abelian braiding statistics can be realized without the need to control tunnel couplings by gate electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> this is a solution to the problem how to operate on topological qubits when gate voltages are screened by the superconductor . </S>"
