    "nonequilibrium extended systems that undergo a pattern forming instability with nonzero group velocity @xcite  whether the latter arises in open - flow configurations @xcite via an imposed through - flow @xcite or internally from a bifurcation to travelling waves @xcite  show a peculiar sensitivity to perturbations in the so called convectively unstable parameter regime @xcite .",
    "therein initially spatially localized perturbations superimposed on some basic unstable , macroscopically unstructured nonequilibrium state of the system are advected downstream by the group velocity .",
    "simultaneously they are selectively amplified @xcite according to the deterministic amplification mechanism that occurs near the pattern forming bifurcation @xcite .",
    "thus , advection spatially deconvolutes the pattern growth from its cause  the perturbation source .",
    "but the latter leaves its signature via the bifurcation - induced , deterministic amplification process on the spatiotemporal properties of the downstream growing macroscopic nonequilibrium structures .",
    "the statistical dynamics of fluctuations of these structures is easily detectable @xcite thus providing information about the small perturbations that have triggered their growth .",
    "the feasibility to distinguish the influence of different perturbation sources ",
    "e.g. those that are external to the system under study versus internal thermal noise  on the macroscopic pattern growth in a very direct way has attracted much research activity recently @xcite .",
    "here one has to keep in mind that the deterministic bifurcation dynamics of the macroscopic structure forming instability determines which of the modes that a perturbation source emits is amplified and which one decays in downstream direction . and as long as the mode amplitudes are still small each of the perturbation modes evolves separately and independently : the bifurcation dynamics is initially linear with saturating nonlinearities being irrelevant thus producing exponential growth with time and downstream distance .",
    "hence , in a system with group velocity in positive @xmath2 direction one expects that fluctuations generated near the inlet boundary at @xmath1 and/or perturbations that might enter the system via the inlet are most important .",
    "they have the longest advection / amplification time to grow in the flow before they reach a particular observation point at a downstream location @xmath3 .",
    "therefore a careful analysis of the influence of the inlet boundary condition relative to the effect of bulk ( fluctuating ) forces is necessary in particular in view of the fact that both sources cause exponential growth .",
    "such an analysis should be able to shed some light on the problem whether in bounded experimental systems it is internal bulk generated thermal noise that triggers and sustains the growth of macroscopic vortex structures in the convectively unstable regime or other kind of environment - produced perturbations that might , e. g. , be advected from the inlet boundary into the bulk .    on the theoretical side the effect of noise on the pattern forming",
    "process has been investigated mainly within the framework of the complex ginzburg - landau amplitude equation ( cgle ) .",
    "it describes the slow spatio - temporal behavior of the complex amplitude @xmath4 of the critical mode of the pattern that can grow first when crossing the bifurcation threshold .",
    "bulk thermal noise is incorporated in this approximation scheme by fluctuating volume forces @xmath5 that act additively on @xmath4 and that are derived @xcite for local thermal equilibrium conditions of driven systems from the linear landau - lifshitz equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics around global thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "but the problem of the inlet boundary condition that arises with the cgle in a finite domain has been addressed only in some idealized way : deissler @xcite imposes @xmath6 at the inlet .",
    "lcke and recktenwald @xcite investigate the pattern growth resulting from an inlet boundary condition that is produced by thermal equilibrium transverse momentum fluctuations which are advected into the system at @xmath7 .",
    "babcock , ahlers , and cannell @xcite have solved the stochastic cgle numerically in a system that was augmented in upstream direction , i.e. , to negative @xmath2 by a small subcritical part and compared with imposing @xmath8 at @xmath1 .",
    "swift , babcock , and hohenberg ( sbh ) @xcite consider solutions of the stochastic cgle where the amplitude fluctuations @xmath9 at the boundary are strongly correlated with the bulk thermal forcing @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we first of all solve the stochastic cgle subject to arbitrary inlet boundary conditions with a spatial laplace transformation method .",
    "we investigate the influence of thermally generated bulk additive forcing on the statistical dynamics of downstream growing amplitude fluctuations in comparison with the effect of statistically stationary inlet fluctuations that are independent of the bulk forcing .",
    "furthermore , we use a simple model to estimate fluctuations that are swept with an imposed through - flow into some experimental systems via the inlet .",
    "this allows to assess more quantitatively the importance of such inlet fluctuations relative to bulk thermal forcing .",
    "experimental setups to tune and to control the former are shortly discussed as well .",
    "finally we compare in detail with the results of sbh .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ ii ] the linear stochastic cgle with thermally generated bulk additive forcing is briefly reviewed .",
    "the solution for the fluctuating amplitudes in frequency space , @xmath11 , and their correlation spectra are given in sec .",
    "the next section presents the model for inlet fluctuations and compares their downstream evolution with the growth of bulk generated fluctuations .",
    "the last section contains a summary . in appendix [ appa ]",
    "we present the `` space - retarded , causal '' green function of our solution in the convectively unstable regime . in appendix [ appb ]",
    "we compare our results for green function , amplitude fluctuations , and correlation spectra with those of sbh .",
    "the systems that we have in mind show a continuous , i.e. , hysteresis - free transition , say , from a spatially homogeneous state to a spatially structured one .",
    "thus , a spatially periodic solution branches in a forwards bifurcation out of the basic solution at a critical control parameter .",
    "the most intensively studied examples for such systems are the rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) problem of straight roll convection vortices in a fluid layer heated from below @xcite or the rotating taylor - couette ( tc ) problem of axisymmetric toroidal taylor vortices in the annulus between concentric cylinders of which the inner one is rotating @xcite .",
    "but our investigation being based on the cgle for such 1d patterns also includes other problems for which this equation captures the essential parts of the pattern formation process .",
    "nevertheless we shall use in the remainder of this paper the terminology of the rb or tc system .",
    "thus , we consider in particular open rb ( tc ) setups with an externally imposed horizontal ( axial ) mean flow through a not too wide rectangular convective channel ( annulus between concentric cylinders ) .",
    "then the deterministic field equations show an oscillatory instability .",
    "the structureless , stationary basic flow without vortices is stable for rayleigh numbers @xmath12 ( taylor numbers @xmath13 ) below a critical threshold @xmath14 $ ] that depends on the through - flow reynolds number @xmath15 . at the critical threshold a stable , spatially extended , temporally oscillatory state of downstream propagating vortices branches off the basic state .",
    "the latter is unstable and the former is stable for supercritical driving .",
    "we use the relative control parameter @xmath16 to measure the distance from the onset of propagating vortex flow for @xmath17 and of stationary vortex flow for @xmath18 , respectively . in this notation @xmath19 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath20 is the critical reduced threshold for onset of propagating vortex flow .",
    "the shear forces of the through - flow slightly stabilize the homogeneous basic state , so @xmath21 slightly increases with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "note that in the rb system we consider so - called transverse vortices whose roll axes are enforced to lie perpendicular to the through - flow direction by the geometrical design of the rectangular convection channel .",

    "@xmath15 the control parameter plane is divided into three domains characterized by different growth behavior of _ linear _ perturbations of the basic flow state . in the presence of through - flow",

    "below the threshold @xmath37 for onset of propagating vortex patterns any perturbation , spatially localized as well as extended , decays .",
    "this is the parameter regime of absolute stability of the basic state .    for @xmath38 extended perturbations can grow",
    "however , a spatially localized perturbation , i.e. , a packet of plane wave perturbations is advected in the so - called convectively unstable parameter regime faster downstream than it grows  while growing in the comoving frame it moves out of the system @xcite .",
    "thus , the downstream as well as the upstream facing intensity front of the vortex packet move into the same direction , namely , downstream",
    ". a spatially localized perturbation is blown out of any system of finite length and the basic state is reestablished .",
    "it therefore requires a persistent source of perturbations like , e.  g. , noise operating in the bulk or fluctuations entering the system via the inlet to sustain a vortex pattern in the convectively unstable regime @xcite .",
    "the spatiotemporal behavior of such `` noise sustained structures '' @xcite being determined by the noise source thus allows to infer properties of the latter from the former .    in the absolutely unstable regime",
    "a localized perturbation grows not only in the downstream direction but it grows and spatially expands also in the upstream direction until the upstream propagating front encounters the inlet in a finite system @xcite .",
    "the final nonlinear stucture @xcite resulting in such a situation is self sustained and stable . for sufficiently large amplitudes this structure is dominated by the deterministic contributions in the relevant balance equations and thus it is insensitive to , say , thermal noise .    within the framework of the amplitude equation the boundary between absolute and convective instability",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath39 thus , the convectively unstable regime investigated here is characterized by @xmath40 or , equivalently , by the reduced group velocity @xmath41 being larger than 2 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the amplitude equation approximation ( [ mucconv ] ) of @xmath42 describes the boundary between absolute and convective instability resulting from the full hydrodynamic field equations @xcite very well in the rb and tc systems for the small reynolds numbers considered here .",
    "the starting point of most theoretical approaches for describing the effect of thermal noise on macroscopic hydrodynamic pattern growth is the langevin concept of landau and lifshitz @xcite .",

    "finally we should like to stress that our model for inlet fluctuations contains only internal thermal fluctuations generated in the subcritical upstream part .",
    "it does not contain other perturbations , e.g. , from the pumping machinery that might in an experimental setup be advected towards the inlet .",

    "the physically motivated restriction is equivalent to choosing the `` space - retarded , causal '' green function that describes propagation away from ( and not towards ) a localized perturbation pulse .",

    "however , for supercritical downstream driving @xmath38 inlet - forced as well as bulk - forced amplitude fluctuations are growing in downstream direction for frequencies @xmath61 within a finite band .",
    "typically the contribution @xmath206 caused by the additive bulk forces to the correlation spectrum @xmath203 of amplitude fluctuations at the downstream location @xmath2 rapidly outgrows with increasing @xmath2 the contribution @xmath207 that follows from the upstream model for inlet fluctuations . in the large-@xmath2 regime",
    "far from the inlet both contributions , @xmath208 as well as @xmath206 , grow @xmath209 with @xmath210 having a maximum close to @xmath211 .",
    "but the prefactors in @xmath140 and @xmath139 are such that there the amplitude fluctuation spectrum @xmath212 typically is dominated by the bulk contribution @xmath206 .",

    "finally , a detailed comparison with a recent approach of sbh showed that the boundary condition that they use at the inlet implies fluctuations there which are strongly correlated with the bulk forcing .",
