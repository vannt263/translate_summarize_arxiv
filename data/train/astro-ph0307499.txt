    "clusters of galaxies are powerful x - ray sources , with luminosities in the range @xmath0 .",
    "this thermal radiation is emitted by an hot ( @xmath1 ) , tenuous ( @xmath2 ) , highly ionized intra cluster gas that fills all the cluster volume and accounts for a dominant fraction of the cluster baryons @xcite .",
    "compelling evidence for the presence of relativistic particles and magnetic field in the intra cluster medium ( hereafter icm ) is given by the observation of a diffuse synchrotron radio emission in a consistent fraction of the rich clusters @xcite .",
    "this gives us a direct proof of the presence of gev electrons and @xmath3 magnetic field .",
    "the same electrons responsible for the radio emission can upscatter the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons in the x - ray band via inverse compton scattering ( ics ) providing an explanation for the hard x - ray excess observed in a few clusters @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms , such as non thermal bremsstrahlung from a population of supra thermal electrons , have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "clusters are also expected to be potential gamma ray sources , the main emission processes being inverse compton scattering off the cosmic microwave background photons ( cmb ) from ultra relativistic electrons and the decay of neutral pions produced in the interactions between cosmic ray protons and icm protons @xcite . in this paper",
    "we make predictions on the number of clusters that future gamma ray telescopes ( both from space and earth ) will be able to detect and on the contribution of clusters to the extragalactic diffuse gamma ray background .",
    "we focus our attention on the photons produced by electrons accelerated at shocks that develop during the process of large scale structure formation .",
    "protons are also accelerated at shocks , they can not escape the cluster volume @xcite and they are re - energized each time a new merger event occurs @xcite .",
    "it follows that the spectrum and the energy density of protons depend on the merger history of the cluster and an hadronic feature might appear on top of the gamma ray emission generated by inverse compton scattering of electrons@xcite .",
    "the icm is heated to the observed high temperature by shock waves that naturally form during the process of large scale structure formation @xcite .",
    "diffusive acceleration can take place at these shocks so that a small fraction of the particles crossing the shock discontinuity can be energized up to relativistic energies .",
    "the maximum energy for the accelerated particles can be evaluated equating the acceleration time with the energy loss time . under the reasonable assumption that during the acceleration process the residence time of the particle in the upstream region is longer than the residence time downstream , and neglecting a weak dependence on the shock mach number we can approximate the acceleration time as @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the upstream diffusion coefficient and the upstream fluid velocity . under these hypothesis",
    "the acceleration time depends only on upstream quantities , unaffected by the presence of the shock . assuming a bohm diffusion coefficient we obtain : @xmath7 for electrons the relevant loss channel is ics on the cmb radiation characterized by a time scale : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the cmb energy density and @xmath10 is the electron lorentz factor . equating [ eq.acc ] and [ eq.loss ]",
    "we obtain the maximum energy for the electrons : @xmath11 corresponding to a maximum energy for the upscattered cmb photons equal to : @xmath12 which falls in the very high energy gamma ray band .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that the bohm diffusion coefficient is the smallest possible one , and that a different choice of the diffusion coefficient could result in a too low maximum energy of the electrons , so that the electron population would be unable to upscatter the cmb photons up to gamma ray energies . in the following we use for the maximum energy the value obtained in eq .",
    "[ eq.max ] .",
    "the spectra of particles accelerated at shocks are power laws in momentum of the form @xmath13 , where the slope @xmath14 is connected to the shock mach number @xmath15 through the well known relation : @xmath16",
    "according to the standard theory of large scale structure formation clusters form hierarchically through mergers of smaller subunits . semi - analytical models describing this process can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "this formalism provides us the comoving density of objects with given mass @xmath17 at a redshift @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the rate at which clusters of mass @xmath20 and @xmath21 merge together at a fixed redshift @xmath18 , @xmath22 . sampling these distributions it is possible to simulate the whole merger history of a cluster with a certain present mass .",
    "each time a merger occurs we can estimate the relative velocity @xmath23 between the two involved clusters using energy conservation @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the masses and virial radii of the two colliding clusters , @xmath27 is the reduced mass and @xmath28 is the turnaround radius of the system . the shock mach number is the ratio between @xmath23 and the sound speed in the icm , given by the virial theorem : @xmath29 in figure [ mach ] ( left panel ) the mach numbers @xmath30 of the shocks are plotted as a function of the ratio between the masses of the two merging clusters .",
    "this result has been obtained simulating 500 different realizations of a merger tree for a cluster with present mass @xmath31 solar masses @xcite . in the right panel the cumulative distribution of mach numbers is shown .",
    "[ mach ] tells us that merger shocks are often weak , following a distribution strongly peaked at @xmath32 and consequently are unable to accelerate relativistic particles in an efficient way ( accelerated spectra are very steep power law with @xmath33 ) .",
    "only @xmath34 of the shocks have mach number",
    "greater than 3 ( corresponding to @xmath35 ) , necessary to be consistent with the spectral shape of cluster radio halos , and these strong shocks form only during minor mergers ( collisions between clusters with very different masses ) . on the contrary radio halos",
    "are found in a consistent fraction ( @xmath36 ) of massive clusters and there seems to be a correlation between the presence of the halo and the signature of a recent major merger @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that radio halos are unlikely to be produced by electrons directly accelerated at merger shocks @xcite .    besides merger shocks , that develop in the icm of virialized objects , we consider here also accretion shocks that form due to the secondary infall of non virialized matter onto an already formed cluster @xcite .",
    "these shocks propagate in a cold medium and are strong by definition , so that the spectra of the accelerated particles are fixed to @xmath37 .",
    "we assume here that a spherical shock forms at the virial radius of each cluster and that the cold infalling matter ( whose density is taken here equal to the average baryon density of the universe ) flows at the free fall velocity .",
    "recently an association between clusters of galaxies and unidentified egret sources was proposed by different authors @xcite .",
    "the physical plausibility and the statistical significance of such an association were strongly questioned in @xcite , and the lack of association was also found in @xcite .",
    "future gamma ray space telescopes , such as agile and glast , will observe the whole sky with a better sensitivity compared to egret .",
    "we make here predictions on the number of objects that these telescopes will be able to detect .",
    "the number of accreting clusters with gamma ray flux greater than a fixed value @xmath38 can be evaluated as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the comoving volume between @xmath18 and @xmath41 , @xmath19 is given in @xcite , and @xmath42 is the mass of a cluster accreting at redshift @xmath18 whose flux is @xmath38 . for merging clusters a similar , slightly more complicated expression , which includes",
    "also the merger rate @xmath22 , holds .",
    "gamma ray luminosities are evaluated assuming that a small fraction @xmath43 of the kinetic energy flowing across the shock is converted in relativistic electrons , which upscatter the cmb photons in the gamma ray energy band .    the results , as obtained in @xcite ,",
    "are shown in fig [ gamma ] ( left panel ) and can be summarized in this way : agile and glast will be able to observe @xmath44 and a few tens of clusters respectively ( both merging and accreting ) , while no one of the unidentified egret sources is expected to be associated with a cluster , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the superposition of gamma ray emission from single clusters results in a diffuse background . in @xcite was firt proposed that the cmb photons , scattered up to gamma ray energies by relativistic electrons accelerated at the shocks that form during large scale structure formation , could account for the whole extragalactic diffuse gamma ray background , as estimated subtracting a galactic emission model to the eget data @xcite .",
    "we evaluate in @xcite this contribution using the formalism described in the previous sections .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] ( right panel ) .",
    "the shaded region corresponds to the egret data and the solid line that roughly fits the data is the prediction made in @xcite .",
    "our estimates of the contribution to the background from accreting and merging clusters are represented by the dotted and dashed lines respectively .",
    "the dot - dashed line represents a more realistic estimate for the diffuse emission due to merging clusters , obtained considering only objects with mass greater than @xmath45 ( the typical mass of a group of galaxies ) .",
    "according to our estimate , forming structures in the universe can account only for @xmath46 of the extragalactic background and this is in agreement with recent results from detailed numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the maximum energy of the upscattered cmb photons falls in the tev range ( see eq.[eq.max ] ) so that we can wonder if clusters could be detected by ground based cherenkov telescopes . in fig .",
    "[ tev ] we plot the sensitivities for a generic telescope as calculated in @xcite for 100 hours of observation with an array consisting of 10 cells ( pointlike and @xmath47 sources ) together with the expected spectra for three different cases ( top to bottom ) : 1 ) a merger between two clusters with masses @xmath31 and @xmath45 , 2 ) a @xmath48 accreting cluster with a magnetic field in the upstream region equal to @xmath49 , 3 ) the same as 2 ) but with a ten times lower magnetic field .",
    "all the considered clusters are at a distance of @xmath50 .",
    "the thin continuous and dotted lines refer to the spectra calculated with and without taking into account the absorption on the infrared background @xcite .",
    "the apparent size of a @xmath48 accreting cluster at a distance of @xmath50 is comparable or even greater than the field of view of cherenkov telescopes ( @xmath51 a few degrees ) , while the size of the emitting region for the merger considered in fig .",
    "[ tev ] should be roughly @xmath47 , making it marginally detectable .",
    "in @xcite we first proposed that merger shocks are often weak and consequently unable to accelerate efficiently relativistic particles .",
    "we developed a recipe to evaluate the shock mach numbers as a function of the masses of the two merging objects finding that shock acceleration can be effective only during minor mergers .",
    "we extended our analysis in @xcite where we included also the effects of strong accretion shocks .",
    "ultrarelativistic electrons can be accelerated at such strong shocks and they can upscatter the cmb photons to very high gamma ray energies , making clusters of galaxies potential gev and tev gamma ray sources .",
    "we estimate that the future gamma ray telescopes agile and glast will observe @xmath44 and @xmath52 clusters respectively @xcite , while we do not expect any association between clusters and unidentified egret sources , in agreement with the observational results presented in @xcite .",
    "we also estimated the contribution from large scale structure formation to the edgrb to be at most equal to @xmath46 of the observed one .    only massive , nearby merging clusters could be detected by future cherenkov arrays , while the detection of accreting clusters seems to be more problematic due to the very extended apparent size of these sources .",
