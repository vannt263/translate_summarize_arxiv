    "the phenomenon of electromigration ( em ) is typical of metallic conductors and consists in a non - steady atomic transport driven by electronic currents of high density @xcite .",
    "the non - steady atomic transport gives rise to the formation and growth of voids and hillocks in different regions of the conductor ( em damage ) @xcite .",
    "this damage cumulates progressively and , when the current is applied for a sufficiently long time , a void grows enough to break completely the metallic line implying an irreversible failure process .",
    "the time required for this process defines the time to failure ( ttf ) of the metallic line @xcite ( though alternative failure criteria can be found in the literature @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of em is largely due to the fact that it is the most common mechanism of failure of the metallic interconnects present in any electronic device @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "a huge number of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies have been and are yet devoted to the subject , especially in the context of modern nanoelectronics .",
    "the central issue in em degradation phenomena is the determination of the ttf and its statistical properties @xcite .",
    "ttfs are measured under very high stress conditions ( currents and temperature much higher than those corresponding to the usual operating conditions of the devices ) in the so called accelerated tests @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation to normal operating conditions is generally performed on the basis of three frequently adopted assumptions @xcite .",
    "first , ttfs are taken to follow a lognormal distribution ( which means that the logarithms of ttfs are normally distributed ) .",
    "this distribution is then characterized by two parameters : the median time to failure , @xmath0 , and the shape factor , @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the time corresponding to the failure of 50% of the lines in the statistical sample and @xmath1 is the lognormal root - mean - square deviation @xcite .",
    "this distribution has been observed in many em failure tests @xcite and recently , new testing techniques @xcite allowing the analysis of very large statistical samples , have shown that the ttf distribution follows a perfect lognormal behavior down to four shape factors @xcite . in spite of this evidence , no satisfactory eplanation has been given until now for the lognormality of the ttf distribution @xcite .",
    "the second assumption concerns the independence of the distribution shape factor of the stress conditions .",
    "actually , @xmath1 was found to be independent of temperature in all the range of values usually considered in accelerated tests @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "a broadening of the distribution has been observed at the lowest current densities used in these tests @xcite .",
    "this broadening of the distribution at low stress conditions has crucial implications on the evaluation of the minimum time to failure , i.e. the time corresponding to the first failure of a line of the family @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this point in sec .",
    "iii.b . together with the results of our simulations .",
    "the third assumption concerns the validity of the following empirical law , known as black s law @xcite , relating @xmath0 to the current density , @xmath2 , and temperature , @xmath3 : @xmath4 \\label{eq : black}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a fitting amplitude , @xmath6 the so called current exponent , @xmath7 the em activation energy and @xmath8 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the validity of this law is confirmed by many experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the simple power law behavior described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : black ] ) , generally holds in a limited range of intermediate current densities @xcite . at high current densities , another power law with a different ( higher ) exponent",
    "is frequently observed and usually attributed to joule heating effects @xcite , while at low current densities @xmath0 deviates from a power law , showing a tendency to diverge @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even in the intermediate range of @xmath2 values , there is no agreement in the literature about the value of the current exponent @xcite .",
    "we will come back on this subject in sec .",
    "iii.b , discussing our results .",
    "the geometry of the line plays a crucial role on the em damage @xcite .",
    "in fact , the depletion and accumulation of mass in different regions of the film , under the driving force exerted by the electronic current , determines the growth of mechanical stress gradients .",
    "the last ones give rise to an atomic back - flow which contrasts the em process @xcite . as the strength of these gradients depends strongly on the line geometry @xcite , geometrical parameters have a fundamental role in the occurrence of failures . in particular , the competition between the driving force of the electronic current and the action of mechanical stress gradients , results in the existence of a current density threshold below which em is stopped @xcite .",
    "this condition was expressed by blech and herring @xcite in the following equation which relates the threshold current density with the length of the line : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the atomic volume , @xmath11 is the maximum value of the mechanical stress difference between the line terminals that a line of length @xmath12 can bear , @xmath13 is the resistivity of the line , @xmath14 the electronic charge and @xmath15 an average effective charge @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : blech ] ) , known as blech s",
    "law @xcite , defines the so called threshold product , @xmath16 .",
    "we will discuss the role of the line geometry on the em failure process in sec .",
    "another fundamental ingredient in the understanding of the em damage of interconnects is represented by the granular structure of the materials employed , al , cu , ag , al alloys , etc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it must be noted that a high degree of disorder is usually present in alloy films ( typically al - cu , al - si ) due to alloying effects @xcite and to thermal gradients @xcite .    a large number of models has been proposed for the study of em @xcite .",
    "many of them are microscopic models which address the problem of identifying the mechanisms responsible for the degradation process in terms of the peculiarities of the material considered @xcite .",
    "then , by using appropriate kinetic equations , some specific features of the damage process are determined and compared with experiments @xcite .",
    "if the peculiarities of the material are sufficiently well accounted for , the predictivity of these models is very high @xcite and therefore they can be very useful for applicative purposes .",
    "however , the approach used by many of these models intrinsically limits their predictivity to some specific features of the em damage .",
    "another class of em models has also been developed in the literature @xcite , based on a `` coarse grain '' random resistor network ( rn ) approach @xcite .",
    "actually , the use of this kind of models is particularly appropriate in consequence of the granular structure of the materials used for the interconnects .",
    "indeed , it has been observed that the atomic transport through grain boundaries and interfaces ( transport channels ) far exceeds that through the bulk of the grains @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is generally possible to neglect mass transport everywhere except within these channels and to describe the film as an interconnected network of atomic conducting paths @xcite .",
    "bradley et al .",
    "@xcite were the first to propose and apply to the study of em a kinetic version of the random fuse model @xcite .",
    "the dynamic fuse model introduced by these authors @xcite adopts a failure criterion for the elementary resistor of the network suitable for the description of the em process .",
    "the predictions of this model concerning the damage pattern and ttfs ( maximum and minimum ttf , relationship of the median time to failure with the current , the temperature and the line geometry ) shows the effectiveness and the potentiality of the resistor network approach @xcite .",
    "however , the model of bradley et al . can not describe many other features of em .",
    "in fact this model , though giving a good description of the driving force of the electronic current , does not take into account the antagonist action exerted by mechanical stress gradients .",
    "on the other hand , the competition between these two effects is essential for giving rise to a threshold current for em @xcite .",
    "therefore , all the phenomenology related to the blech s law @xcite and saturation effects @xcite can not be accounted for within the bradley s model .",
    "moreover , this model completely neglects joule heating effects which are present in high stress condition @xcite .    here , we illustrate a theoretical approach to em which aims at studying the different features associated with this phenomenon within a unified theoretical framework . similarly to the approach of bradley et al . , our study is performed by renouncing to provide a description of the kinetics at an atomistic level and by adopting the rn approach , thus focusing on the correlations established by the electronic current among the different components of the system ( grains , clusters of grains , interfaces , etc .",
    "i.e. atomic transport channels )",
    ". however , in contrast to the dynamic fuse model @xcite , we use the biased percolation model @xcite , which adopts a probabilistic failure criterion for the elementary resistor of the network .",
    "the em damage is described in terms of competition between two biased stochastic processes taking place in a resistor network @xcite .",
    "then , by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , we are able to study a variety of relevant features of em degradation .",
    "early stage results has been presented in refs .",
    "[ ] . in this article",
    ", we present a comprehensive study which includes many fundamental new features .    as a first we will show results concerning the damage pattern , the resistance evolution and alloying effects . then , large attention will be devoted to the behavior of ttfs .",
    "we will show that the model correctly predicts a lognormal distribution for them , perfectly superimposing with the experimental one .",
    "the dependence of the parameters of the ttf distribution on temperature and current has also been investigated .",
    "the black s law @xcite has been recovered not only for low but also for high current values and the current exponents are in good agreement with the experimental results in both cases . by using a rectangular geometry ,",
    "the dependence of ttfs on the length and width of the metallic line has been investigated , so that , for a fixed width , the blech s",
    "law @xcite has been tested and a general expression has been obtained for the dependence of ttfs on both , length and width .",
    "finally , but not of minor interest , we have considered resistance saturation effects @xcite and the properties of resistance fluctuations , by focusing on the non - gaussianity of the distribution and on their power spectrum .",
    "thus , our approach is able to account for a phenomenological scenario much wider than that considered by all existing em models .    finally , we emphasize the fact that the interest in em phenomena is not limited to strictly applicative and practical purposes . indeed",
    ", the understanding of non - equilibrium and failure phenomena in disordered systems represents a fundamental topic which has attracted a large attention in the recent literature @xcite . in this respect",
    ", it must be noted that em , which occurs in granular materials , in presence of a significant disorder , driven by an external bias and contrasted by growth of mechanical stress gradients , exhibits practically all the main ingredients to represents a paradigmatic example of failure process in a disordered system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii briefly surveys the theoretical model and define the parameters of interest . sec .",
    "iii presents the results in connection with : ( a ) resistance evolution , ( b ) stress conditions , ( c ) geometrical effects , ( d ) resistance saturation and fluctuations .",
    "iv draws the main conclusions .",
    "we describe a thin metallic line of length @xmath12 , width @xmath17 and thickness @xmath18 as a two - dimensional resistor network of rectangular shape and square - lattice structure .",
    "the network of resistance @xmath19 is made by @xmath20 and @xmath21 resistors in the length and width directions respectively .",
    "the external bias , represented by a constant voltage @xmath22 or a constant current @xmath23 , is applied to the rn through electrical contacts realized by perfectly conducting bars at the left and right hand sides of the network .",
    "thus , the total number of network resistors ( excluding the contacts ) is : @xmath24 .",
    "each resistor can be associated with a single grain , a small cluster of grains or an interfacial path . by denoting with @xmath25 the average size of the grains , of the grain clusters or of the interfacial path",
    ", the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be related to the ratios @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the network lies on an insulating substrate at temperature @xmath28 , acting as a thermal bath , and it is made by three kinds of resistors : i ) regular resistors , ii ) impurity resistors , iii ) broken resistors .",
    "the regular resistors are associated with grains of `` normal '' resistivity ( void free ) .",
    "the resistance of these resistors depends linearly on temperature , according to the expression : @xmath29 \\label{eq : temp_dep}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the resistor label , @xmath30 the temperature coefficient of the resistance ( tcr ) , @xmath31 the local temperature , @xmath32 and @xmath33 the reference values for the tcr . when the joule heating is negligible @xmath34 and the regular resistors are all equal to @xmath35 .",
    "the impurity resistors of resistance @xmath36 are associated with the formation / dissolution of cual@xmath37 precipitates ( low - resistivity cluster ) during the stress conditions .",
    "thus , they account for the variation in the alloy composition during the em test due to the electron wind and/or to thermal effects ( alloying effects ) @xcite .",
    "finally , the broken resistors correspond to the presence of microvoids at the grain boundary and , possibly , inside the grains . these broken resistors of resistance @xmath38 ( op stays for open circuit ) are thus associated with very high resistivity regions inside the line . here ,",
    "we have taken @xmath39 .",
    "the existence of temperature gradients due to current crowding and joule heating effects is accounted for by taking the local temperature of the _ n_-th resistor ( regular , impurity or broken ) of resistance @xmath40 given by the following expression @xcite : @xmath41 ,   \\label{eq : temp}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the thermal resistance of the single resistor , @xmath43 is the number of first neighbors of the _ n_-th resistor , @xmath44 the current flowing in it and @xmath45 is the current flowing in the _",
    "m_-th neighbor .",
    "the value @xmath46 is chosen to provide uniform heating of the perfect network , i.e. made by identical resistors .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : temp ] ) is the fourier equation written by taking the simplifying assumption of instantaneous thermalization of the resistor , i.e. by taking a stationary regime and neglecting time dependent effects in the heat diffusion @xcite . under this hypothesis",
    ", the diffusive term must balance the term related to the power supplied by the external current and generated on the resistor or transmitted to it by mutual interactions .",
    "a simplified form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) , not including thermal exchanges with neighbor resistors has been firstly proposed by gingl et al .",
    "for a perfect @xcite or nearly perfect network of resistance @xmath47 , when a mean - field approach is meaningful , the average temperature increase is thus @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the structure thermal resistance @xcite .",
    "the em damage , consisting in the formation of microvoids under the action of the electron wind , is simulated by a stochastic process of resistor breaking .",
    "in other terms , we consider that the transformation of the _ n_-th resistor ( regular or impurity ) into a broken one , @xmath50 , can occur with probability @xmath51 . by adopting the biased percolation model @xcite ,",
    "we have taken the following expression for @xmath51 : @xmath52 ,   \\label{eq : w_break}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a characteristic activation energy .",
    "in fact , equation  ( [ eq : w_break ] ) coupled with eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) , implies that the void formation process is a biased percolation @xcite .",
    "this means a probability of breaking a resistor ( generation of microvoids ) higher for resistors crossed by high current values @xcite .",
    "thus , the breaking probability is nonuniform for the different resistors in the network and it changes with time .",
    "we note that @xmath51 depends on the current distribution , which in turn depends on the network configuration @xcite .",
    "as the last one results from a progressive accumulation of damage , the history of the network is partly accounted for by the biased percolation model .",
    "the effect of the atomic back - flow , which contrasts the em , is simulated by introducing a recovery process consisting in a stochastic healing of the broken resistors @xcite .",
    "therefore , the transformation @xmath54 is allowed with probability : @xmath55 ,   \\label{eq : w_recov}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is a recovery activation energy .",
    "furthermore , the variation of the line composition due to alloying effects is described by allowing the stochastic transitions @xcite : @xmath57 and @xmath58 , occurring with probabilities @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] respectively , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are two characteristic activation energies . by adopting this description of alloying effects",
    ", we are limiting ourself to consider the change in the elementary resistances due to a variation inside any grain or cluster of grains ( single resistor ) of the number of cu atoms dispersed in the matrix or present in small cual@xmath37 precipitate @xcite .",
    "the initial configuration of the rn can contain some initial concentrations of broken and impurity resistors , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "alternatively this initial configuration can be chosen as the perfect one : @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the network evolution is obtained by monte carlo simulations which are carried out according to the following iterative procedure .",
    "\\(i ) starting from the initial network , we calculate @xmath67 and the network resistance @xmath19 by solving kirchhoff s loop equations .",
    "moreover , we calculate @xmath68 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) op and @xmath69 are generated with the corresponding probabilities @xmath70 and @xmath71 and the remaining @xmath72 are changed according to @xmath68 . then @xmath67 and @xmath68 are recalculated .",
    "\\(iii ) op and @xmath69 are recovered with probabilities @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively , and the resistances @xmath72 are changed again according to @xmath68 .",
    "\\(iv ) @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath19 are recalculated .",
    "this procedure is iterated from ( ii ) , thus the loop ( ii)-(iv ) corresponds to an iteration step , which is associated with a unit time step on an arbitrary time scale to be calibrated by comparison with experiments .",
    "depending on the parameter values , which are related to the physical properties of the line and to the external conditions , the two following possibilities can be achieved during the iteration procedure : irreversible failure or steady - state evolution . in the first case ,",
    "at least one percolating cluster of broken resistor ( i.e. a cluster connecting the top and the bottom of the network ) is formed and thus the resistance @xmath19 diverges @xcite . in the second case , the network resistance fluctuates around an average value @xmath75 ( saturation value ) @xcite .",
    "the average over the statistical ensemble ( different realizations of failure of networks with the same parameters and in the same external conditions ) of the values of the fraction of broken resistors corresponding to the appearance of at least one percolating cluster , is called percolation threshold and it is denoted as @xmath76 @xcite .    to check the model we have considered em tests performed with a standard median time to failure technique @xcite on al-0.5%cu lines .",
    "the tests have been carried out at different currents and temperatures by adopting a 2-metal level configuration with tungsten vias @xcite and by using a 20% relative resistance variation as failure criterion .",
    "the lines used in the tests were @xmath77 @xmath78 m long , @xmath79 @xmath78 m wide and @xmath80 @xmath78 m thick .",
    "the last thermal treatment undergone by these lines occurred during fabrication and it consisted in a high temperature annealing followed by a rapid cooling .",
    "this treatment left a non - equilibrium concentration of cu dissolved into the al matrix . therefore , in the early stage of the em test , the heating associated with the stress conditions gives rise to a formation of cual@xmath37 precipitates .",
    "the low resistivity of these clusters and , mainly , the reduction of the internal disorder , i.e. the reduction of the number of scattering centers of cu in the solid solution , cause an initial decrease of the line resistance @xcite . here , we consider the data obtained at @xmath81 k , shown in ref . ,",
    "and the data obtained at @xmath82 k , reported in the following section . in both cases",
    "the stress current density was @xmath83 ma/@xmath84 .",
    "the resistance of the lines at the reference temperature @xmath85 k was : @xmath86 @xmath87 ( averaged over a family of 40 samples ) , while the tcr was @xmath88 k@xmath89 .",
    "the values of the parameters used in the simulations have been chosen as follows .",
    "we have taken the values corresponding to the actual stress conditions and to the physical parameters of the metallic line whenever possible , i.e. whenever it was possible to make a direct correspondence with the model parameters and the line properties and when this choice was not too heavy computationally .",
    "the remaining parameters have been chosen to fit the experimental results and/or to reduce the computational effort . concerning this point",
    ", we notice that the present approach allows for a direct simulation of lines with ratio @xmath90 up to @xmath91 . to describe the resistance evolution of lines characterized by higher values of this ratio , as the lines tested in the experiments shown in the next section ( where @xmath92 )",
    ", we have adopted the following further approximation .",
    "the network is taken to represent the region of dominant void growth inside a longer line , i.e. the region responsible for the resistance variation of the line .",
    "we can take the length of this region given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is an integer number .",
    "thus , in the initial conditions : @xmath95 . on the other hand , according to the above assumption we have : @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the relative resistance variation of the whole line can be expressed as : @xmath97 .",
    "we underline that this approximation is used only to check the model by a direct comparison of the measured resistance evolutions of long lines ( fig .",
    "2 ) and the evolutions calculated by the present model ( fig .",
    "3 ) . all the other results concern short lines and do not make use of the above approximation .",
    "thus , except when differently specified , we have used the following values of the parameters : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 k , @xmath102 ma ( which corresponds to the values of @xmath2 , @xmath17 and @xmath103 used in the em tests cited above ) , @xmath104 k@xmath89 , @xmath85 k ,",
    "@xmath105 @xmath87 , @xmath106 @xmath87 . for the long lines used in the em tests , when @xmath107 , this value of @xmath33 provides the correct value for @xmath108 , reported above .",
    "moreover , we have taken @xmath109 k / w . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermalres ] ) , this value of @xmath42 provides an initial heating of the network of @xmath110 k , comparable with that estimated in the experiments of ref . .",
    "the initial network configuration corresponds to @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , we have taken : @xmath111 ev and @xmath112 ev , as reasonable values for the activation energies @xmath53 and @xmath56 .",
    "we notice that the value of @xmath53 controls the range of the time scale , nevertheless this range is in any case arbitrary within our model .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath53 can be considered as a free parameter which can be chosen with the purpose of saving computational time .",
    "more crucial is the choice of @xmath56 , whose value sets the importance of the recovery process @xcite , i.e. the strength of the atomic back - flow due to the mechanical stress .",
    "consequently with this choice of @xmath53 and @xmath56 , the values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 have been taken sufficiently small to account for the separation of the temporal scales of the void formation and of the alloying processes , observed in the experiments . here ,",
    "we have taken : @xmath113 ev and @xmath114 ev .",
    "a typical resistance evolution and the corresponding damage pattern near the final failure are reported in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , respectively .",
    "in this case @xmath115 while all other parameters take the values specified at the end of the previous section . in fig .",
    "1(a ) we observe a resistance drop at the early stages of the evolution due to the generation of impurity resistors .",
    "this process @xmath57 simulates the variation of composition of the line associated with the initial precipitation of part of the cu dissolved in the al matrix , as discussed in sec .",
    "ii . on the other hand , this process together with the antagonist one , @xmath58 , takes place on a time scale that is much shorter than that associated with the generation of broken resistors .",
    "therefore , after a given amount of time ( relaxation time of the alloying process ) , the concentration of the impurity resistors reaches its steady state value @xcite corresponding to the temperature @xmath116 . on a longer time scale ,",
    "the fraction of broken resistors increases and the network becomes more and more unstable .",
    "this implies an increase of both the resistance value and the resistance fluctuations , as shown in fig .",
    "finally , at a given time ( time to failure ) the fraction of broken resistors reaches the percolation threshold and @xmath117 diverges .",
    "figure 1(b ) reports the damage pattern just before the final failure .",
    "precisely , this figure shows the temperature distribution inside the network : the broken resistors are the missing ones while the different gray levels , from black ( cold ) to white ( hot ) , correspond to different @xmath31 values ranging from the substrate temperature up to @xmath118 k , with a temperature step of @xmath119 k. the damage pattern mainly consists of a channel of broken resistors elongated in the direction perpendicular to the current flow , a characteristic feature of the biased percolation @xcite .",
    "this simulated damage pattern reproduces well the experimental pattern observed by scanning electron or x - ray microscopy in metallic lines which are failed due to em @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the resistance evolutions of seven al-0.5%cu lines measured in the em tests performed at @xmath82 k , as described in sec .",
    "these lines were stressed by a current density @xmath83 ma/@xmath84 which corresponds to @xmath120 ma .",
    "figure 3 reports the resistance evolutions obtained by simulations . here , different curves correspond to different realizations of failure . in this case , we have taken : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath107 , @xmath121 k , @xmath122 @xmath87 , @xmath123 @xmath87 , @xmath124 ( the broken resistors in the initial network configuration are supposed uniformly distributed ) , while the remaining parameters have the same values specified at the end of sec .",
    "ii . the time scale in fig .",
    "3 has been calibrated according to the following procedure . the statistical sample tested in the experiments",
    "was composed by thirteen lines and the resulting median time to failure , @xmath0 , was : @xmath125 s. a sample of thirteen simulated failure realizations was considered and the corresponding @xmath126 was calculated in units of iteration steps . from these two values , we obtained the value @xmath127 sec for the time interval to be associated with each iterative step .",
    "the comparison between figs .",
    "2 and 3 shows that the calculated evolution of the resistance well reproduces the main features of the observed evolution .",
    "we note that a small discrepancy between measured and simulated evolutions appears just before the failure , where the abrupt increase of the resistance shown by the simulated curves , contrasts with a pre - failure increase of the resistance generally present in the experimental ones .",
    "this discrepancy , is partly due to the factor @xmath128 relating the relative resistance variation of the network with that of the metallic line .",
    "in fact , the simulated evolutions obtained for short lines , see fig .",
    "1(a ) , when the full metallic line can be directly simulated and the approximation adopted for long lines can be avoided ( i.e. @xmath100 ) display also a pre - failure region .",
    "the agreement is further confirmed by the comparison between the distributions of the measured and calculated ttfs reported in fig .",
    "4 . this figure shows on a lognormal plot @xcite the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the failure probability as a function of the times to failure obtained from the em tests ( full circles ) and simulations ( open circles ) considered above .",
    "the agreement between experiments and simulations is excellent and the shape factor of the two distributions is @xmath129 in both cases .",
    "thus , the direct comparison of the results of the model and of the em tests shown in figs . 2 , 3 and 4 ,",
    "validate the present computational approach for the study of em failures .    as anticipated in sec .",
    "i , two central problems encountered in the study of em phenomenon concern the role played by the stress conditions and the line geometry on the damage process @xcite .",
    "therefore , with the purpose of further checking the predictivity of the model and of extracting new information from it , we have calculated the effect on ttfs of temperature , stress current , length and width of the lines . to contain the computational effort and to avoid the approximation used for long lines ,",
    "the study has been limited to short or moderately short lines .",
    "thus , in the following we will discuss the results of simulations carried out by taking @xmath100 , by varying @xmath28 , @xmath23 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , while keeping all the remaining parameters to the values specified at the end of sec .",
    "we start by considering the effect of temperature on the times to failure of @xmath132 networks of sizes @xmath133 stressed by a current of @xmath120 ma .",
    "accordingly , we analyse the dependence on temperature of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the two parameters which determine a lognormal distribution .",
    "we consider fourteen values of @xmath28 ranging from 400 k to 800 k , a considerably wider range with respect to standard accelerated tests @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows the cumulative distribution functions of the failure probability calculated for @xmath134 k ( triangles left ) , @xmath135 k ( open squares ) , @xmath121 k ( open circles ) and @xmath136 k ( triangles down ) , while the solid lines fit the cdfs with lognormal distributions .",
    "these four @xmath28 values are selected as representative for the behavior of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , we have found that @xmath1 is nearly independent of temperature in a wide range of intermediate temperature values , while it increases significantly at low temperatures and decreases at the highest temperatures considered here .",
    "the broadening of the distribution at low temperatures and its narrowing at high temperatures witness the different importance of the network microgeometry in the two extreme stress conditions of @xmath137 and @xmath138 k , respectively .",
    "indeed , the network microgeometry , resulting from the stochasticity of the defectiveness , give rise to a kind of network individuality . at very high stress , the differences in the network microgeometry",
    "loose their importance .",
    "the contrary occurs at low stress , where this diversity becomes of importance in determining the actual ttf .",
    "we underline that the broadening of the ttf distribution at low temperatures has important implications in the interpretation and use of the results of accelerated em tests .",
    "in fact , when evaluating the reliability of a family of lines under standard operating conditions ( usually close to room temperature and relatively low current density ) , it is crucial to estimate not only @xmath0 but also the minimum time to failure @xcite .",
    "the determination of these two quantities is usually obtained from accelerated tests performed at high temperatures on a statistically significant , but in any case small , sample of the entire family .",
    "then , the estimate of the minimum time to failure of the family is obtained by an extrapolation of the cdf in the region of low failure probability @xcite .",
    "such an estimate is very sensitive to a possible broadening of the ttfs distribution at the operation temperature .",
    "for this reason it is crucial to estimate and to take into account the dependence of @xmath1 on temperature .",
    "we remark that the increase of @xmath1 at low temperatures is a source of the following apparent paradox @xcite : the minimum time to failure at low temperatures can be shorter than the minimum time to failure at high temperatures .",
    "we will face a similar paradox by discussing the dependence of @xmath1 on the current @xcite .",
    "solutions to this apparent paradox has been proposed in the literature @xcite , based on the necessity of testing large samples and on the introduction of a three parameters lognormal distribution , where the third parameter is a characteristic incubation time @xcite .    the analysis of the temperature dependence of the ttfs is completed by fig .",

    "thus , the calculated values of @xmath0 perfectly follow , within the numerical uncertainty , the black s law @xcite , discussed in sec .",
    "i. the value of @xmath7 extracted from the fit is @xmath141 ev , thus @xmath142 , and we can identify the activation energy of the resistor breaking process with the em activation energy .    to investigate the effect of current on the failure process , we have calculated the ttfs of @xmath133 networks stressed at @xmath101 k by different ( thirteen ) current values in the range @xmath143 ma . for each current value @xmath1 and @xmath0 have been determined by considering twenty realizations of failure .",
    "figure 7 shows the cdfs of the failure probability versus failure time , calculated for @xmath144 ma ( triangles down ) , @xmath145 ma ( open squares ) , @xmath146 ma ( open circles ) .",
    "the solid lines fit the cdfs with lognormal distribution .",
    "we have found that the shape factor of the distribution exhibits a minimum at intermediate values of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , we can identify two regions of current values : a moderate current ( m.c . )",
    "region , where @xmath1 decreases at increasing current , and a high current ( h.c . ) region , where @xmath1 increases at increasing current .",
    "such a broadening of the ttfs distribution at low currents has been actually observed in several em tests @xcite .",
    "its implications concerning the evaluation of reliability of metallic lines are similar to those previously mentioned in connection with the effect of temperature .",
    "a detailed discussion of these problems can be found in ref . .",
    "here , we underline that the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath1 versus current contrasts the general monotonic behavior found versus temperature",
    ". this non - monotonic behavior of @xmath1 can be understood by considering also the dependence of @xmath0 on the current that is reported in fig .",
    "more precisely , we show in the inset of this figure a log - log plot of the calculated values of @xmath0 versus @xmath23 .",
    "we can see that @xmath0 exhibits two power - law regions .",

    "a second power - law with a higher exponent , @xmath148 , is found in the high current region .",
    "we notice that similar behaviors at high current densities have actually been observed in em measurements and are frequently reported in the literature @xcite .",

    "8 shows that @xmath0 drastically increases at the lowest currents . here",
    ", for @xmath149 ma the networks are found to remain stable over more than @xmath150 iterations .",
    "this strong increase of @xmath0 is associated with the existence of a threshold current , @xmath151 , below which a steady state condition is achieved , manifesting itself in a saturation of the network resistance .",
    "accordingly , for @xmath152 the electrical breakdown no longer occurs .",

    "we emphasize that this sharp increase of @xmath0 at low currents has also been observed in em tests @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dependence of @xmath0 on the current obtained by simulations agrees with the behavior measured over the full range of current values . to complete the analysis , fig .",

    "figure 8 displays two current regions , each characterized by a given value of @xmath156 .",
    "these two regions correspond to the different current dependence of the distribution shape factor , reported in fig .",
    "the common behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with current originates from the change with the bias of both the damage pattern and the magnitude of joule heating and can be understood as follows .",
    "first , let us consider a simpler system : a network in which two stochastic processes of resistor breaking and recovery occur with uniform probabilities : @xmath157 $ ] and @xmath158 $ ] .",

    "( [ eq : fail_cond ] ) . for this simple system",
    "it is quite easy to determine the role of the size and of the geometry of the network on the value of the percolation threshold .",
    "in fact , an ideally infinite network ( @xmath163 and @xmath164 ) , with percolation threshold @xmath165 , would have a zero probability of breaking for a fraction of defects @xmath166 and a breaking probability equal to 1 for @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "however , for networks of finite size there is a non vanishing probability of formation of the percolating cluster of defects ( thus , of breaking ) also when the defect fraction is @xmath168 and , for contrast , a probability less than 1 for @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "for this reason , when networks of finite size are considered , @xmath76 is defined as the average over the statistical ensemble of the minimum values of @xmath169 corresponding to the formation of at least one percolating cluster @xcite , as anticipated in sec .",

    "the reduction of @xmath76 when increasing the length , by keeping constant the width of the network , can be explained as a consequence of the existence of a higher number of possible paths of defects connecting the top and the bottom of such a network compared to a square network with the same width .",
    "these feature is associated with the greatest instability of networks with this geometry .",
    "we note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fail_cond])-([eq : qdef ] ) and the subsequent discussion apply to the case of random percolation , therefore the average time to failure given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : attf ] ) is independent of the current . on the other hand ,",
    "electromigration is a current driven phenomenon which , within our approach , is described by a biased percolation @xcite .",
    "the effect of the biased percolation can be roughly decomposed in two components : i ) a correlated growth of the defect pattern , which exhibits an increasing degree of filamentation at increasing currents ; ii ) an average heating of the network due to joule effect .",
    "the filamentation driven by the external current implies a bias dependent percolation threshold @xmath181 , as shown in fig .",

    ". however , fig .",
    "10 shows that joule heating can affect the value of @xmath6 also in the moderate current region . in this region",
    "values @xmath195 have been reported by different authors @xcite .",
    "many em models have been proposed to explain the value of the current exponent @xcite .",
    "these models fall into two main categories : `` void growth '' and `` nucleation '' models @xcite . in the void growth models ,",
    "the failure is taken to occur after a void grows up to a critical size .",
    "it is generally accepted that this category of models provides a value @xmath196 @xcite . in nucleation models ,",
    "the failure arises from the buildup of a critical vacancy concentration .",
    "it is generally believed that this second category of models provides a value @xmath193 @xcite .",
    "recently , tammaro and setlik @xcite have proved that even when nucleation is the limiting process it can be @xmath195 .",
    "our results confirm this conclusion . as a matter of fact that the present model , which relates the failure to the achievement of a percolation threshold for the defect fraction , belong to the second category of models .",

    "10 , metallic lines with different structure thermal resistance @xmath197 , thus exploiting different sensitivity to joule heating effects can exhibit different current exponent values , even in the moderate current region .",
    "concerning this point , we underline the fact that a power - law behavior of the attf versus current is predicted by the model merely as a consequence of the filamentation of the damage pattern , even neglecting the effect of the average heating of the metallic line .",
    "moreover , the dependence of @xmath6 on the length of the lines , reported in em tests @xcite , can be explained in terms of dependence of both , heating effects and @xmath76 , on the length of the system . finally , from fig .",
    "10 we can see that joule heating is also responsible for the shift towards lower current values of the crossover between the high - current and the moderate - current regions ( in this case from @xmath198 ma to @xmath199 ma ) . on the basis of the above considerations we can now understand the dependence with current of the shape factor of the ttfs distribution shown in fig .",
    "7 . at relatively low currents , just above the @xmath151 threshold ,",
    "the degree of filamentation of the defect pattern is week and there is a wide spread in the network microgeometries and thus in the ttfs .",
    "then , at increasing currents , the degree of filamentation increases and the effect of the different network microgeometries is reduced together with the spread in the ttfs . finally , in the highest current region ,",
    "because of strong joule heating , multi - filamentation occurs @xcite .",
    "this implies a high degree of stochasticity and in turn a high variability of microgeometries together with an increase of the ttfs spreading .",
    "in this section we investigate the effect of the length and width of the network on the failure process .",
    "first , we have analysed the dependence of @xmath0 on the length @xmath130 of the network .",
    "figure 11 displays the simulated median time to failure as a function of @xmath130 .",
    "the data indicated by full circles are obtained by taking : @xmath200 and @xmath120 ma , while the data reported as open squares and shown in the inset of fig .",
    "11 correspond to @xmath201 and @xmath202 ma .",
    "thus , in both cases the current density ( measured in current units ) @xcite is @xmath203 ma .",
    "we have found that @xmath0 sharply increases by decreasing @xmath130 and it diverges for network lengths below a certain value , @xmath204 .",
    "this length can be considered as a critical length of the network and it is dependent on the network width , as shown in fig .",
    "furthermore , for sufficiently long networks , @xmath0 nearly saturates to a value independent of the length and increasing when increasing the width . in the following",
    ", this asymptotic value of the median time to failure in the limit of infinitely long lines will be denoted as @xmath205 . the behavior of @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "11 is in qualitative good agreement with the behavior observed in the em experiments @xcite .    to determine more precisely the dependence of the median time to failure on the geometrical parameters , we have analysed the simulated values of @xmath0 as a function of the difference @xmath206 .",

    "12 correspond to the same value of @xmath2 .",

    "however , in the case of long lines the dependence of @xmath0 on the width shows a saturation at the largest width .",
    "by contrast , in the case of short lines this saturation disappears and @xmath0 exhibits a final sharp increase with the width and a tendency to diverge when approaching the blech condition .",
    "this behavior of @xmath0 is in overall agreement with the results of em tests performed on lines larger than about @xmath194 @xmath78 m @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it has been found that narrow lines , with width smaller than @xmath194 @xmath78 m , exhibit a sharp lengthening of the median time to failure @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon occurs because for such narrow lines ( known as bamboo structures ) the grain size becomes comparable with the line width @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the lack in these lines of grain boundaries along the direction of current implies that em can only occur within the bulk of the grains or along interfaces .",
    "these processes usually require an activation energy significantly higher than that associated with em along grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "therefore , bamboo structures exhibit median time to failure longer than that displayed by other kinds of lines @xcite .",
    "figure 14 shows that our model , in the present formulation , is unable to describe the lengthening of @xmath0 for very narrow lines .",
    "this is not surprising considering the fact that here we have taken a single value for the activation energy of the breaking process , @xmath53 , that is a value common to all the resistors in the network . a further implementation of the model which introduces two different activation energies for the breaking of bulk resistors and surface resistors , @xmath250 and @xmath251 respectively , with @xmath252 , would account also for this lengthening of @xmath0 for narrow lines typical of bamboo structures .      in this section",

    "electromigration stops and the resistance of the line achieves a steady state value ( saturation value ) dependent on the external conditions and on the properties of the line @xcite .",
    "the steady state is characterized by fluctuations of the resistance around the average value @xmath75 ( this value is calculated by averaging over all the steady state values of the resistance , i.e. the values taken after the transient time associated with the termination of the em process ) @xcite .",
    "the study of resistance saturation effects and of their dependence on the stress current , temperature , geometry and other properties of the metallic line , can provide an important tool to investigate em phenomena @xcite , alternative to the study of the median time to failure .",
    "actually , studies of em based on saturation effects exhibit the advantage to be non - destructive and in particular , they reveal their effectiveness in the analysis of short lines @xcite . furthermore , from a fundamental point of view , they provide the possibility to investigate fluctuation phenomena under far from equilibrium conditions .",

    "16 show a considerable non - gaussianity of the distribution of @xmath258 , which is associated with the fact that the system is close to breakdown conditions . we have found that this non - gaussianity is sufficiently well fitted by a generalized form @xcite of the gumbel distribution ( solid curve ) , where this last is commonly used for the analysis of extreme events @xcite .",
    "the role of the stress current and of the size of the system on the distribution of the resistance fluctuations has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the conditions under which the distribution achieves the universal behavior described by the bramwell , holdsworth and pinton distribution @xcite have been identified .    as a second feature ,",
    "we consider the power spectral density of resistance fluctuations . to this purpose ,",
    "17 displays the power spectrum associated with the steady state signal in fig . 15 . both the frequency and the spectral density are expressed in arbitrary units .",
    "two regions can be identified in the spectrum : a 1/f like branch at low frequencies and a lorentzian cut - off at high frequencies .",
    "this feature is here interpreted as due to the presence of three relaxation mechanisms : i ) the slowest one related to the breaking and recovery of the regular resistors and describing the generation and recovery of microvoids ; ii ) the fastest one associated with the transformation of regular resistors into impurity resistors ( and vice versa ) and describing alloying effects ; iii ) an intermediate one corresponding to generation and breaking of impurity resistors .",
    "accordingly , the lorentzian branch describes the evolution occurring on a fast scale when only the second transformation is present . on the slow scale ,",
    "the other two transformations become of importance and thus all the relaxation mechanisms coexist .",
    "therefore , a 1/f - like spectrum appears in the low frequency region , in agreement with resistance noise measurements performed on al - cu alloys @xcite .",
    "we notice that by taking different activation energies for bulk and surface resistors , as described at the end of sect .",
    "iii.c , a further relaxation time would be added .",
    "we have applied the biased percolation model to the study of degradation and failure phenomena induced by em in metallic line .",
    "our `` coarse grain '' approach focuses on the correlations established by the electronic current among the different elemental resistors of the network which mimic the structural components of the system ( grains , clusters of grains , interfaces , etc .",
    "i.e. atomic transport channels ) .",
    "this approach provides a unified theoretical framework able to account successfully for many relevant features of the experiments , including the damage pattern , the resistance evolution , alloying effects and the statistical properties of ttfs .",
    "in particular , the model correctly predicts a lognormal distribution for ttfs , perfectly superimposing with the experimental one and it is able to estimate the dependence of the shape factor of the distribution on current and temperature . in what concerns the dependence of the median time to failure on the stress conditions ,",
    "the model predictions agree with the experiments over the full range of current and temperature values considered .",
    "simulations performed on rectangular networks of different length and width have allowed us to investigate the dependence of ttfs on these parameters .",
    "the results of the model agree with the existence of a blech s length , moreover they predict the existence of a scaling relation between the mtf and the line length . finally , we have considered resistance saturation effects . in this case",
    "we have studied the properties of the resistance fluctuations , by focusing on the non - gaussianity of the distribution and on their power spectrum .",
    "the flexibility of the theoretical approach offers further possibility to describe and interpret phenomena which at present have not been considered .",
    "we finally emphasize that em , which occurs in granular materials , in presence of a significant disorder , driven by an external bias and contrasted by growth of mechanical stress gradient , represents a paradigmatic example of failure process in a disordered system .",
    "therefore , the ability of our approach to account for a wide scenario of the em related phenomenology should be of interest in the more extensive perspective of understanding non - equilibrium and failure phenomena in disordered systems .",
