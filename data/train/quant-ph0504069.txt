    "the experimental demonstration of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite has lead to the development of atom lasers by outcoupling atoms from trapped becs by either a radio frequency transition or a raman transition to change the internal state of the atom to one that is either untrapped or anti - trapped @xcite .",
    "atom lasers are coherent matter waves with spectral fluxes many orders of magnitude higher than thermal sources of atoms .",
    "the coherence of these sources will enable an increase in the sensitivity of interferometric measurements @xcite .",
    "although current experiments usually operate in parameter regimes limited by technical noise , the fundamental limit on these measurements will be caused by the shot noise of the atomic field , which will be intrinsic to all interferometers without a non - classical atomic source .",
    "sensitivity is increased in optical interferometry by ` squeezing ' the quantum state of the optical field , where the quantum fluctuations in one quadrature are reduced compared to a coherent state , while the fluctuations in the conjugate quadrature are increased . in the context of atom optics ,",
    "it is interesting to ask whether highly squeezed atom optical sources can be produced .",
    "there is also great interest in the production of entangled atomic beams for quantum information processing and tests of quantum mechanics with massive particles @xcite .",
    "this paper will describe methods of coupling the quantum statistics from optical fields to produce non - classical atomic sources with high efficiency .",
    "generation of squeezed atomic beams has been proposed by either utilising the nonlinear atomic interactions to create correlated pairs of atoms via either molecular down conversion or spin exchange collisions @xcite , or by transferring the quantum state of a squeezed optical field to the atomic beam @xcite . in the first case",
    ", it was shown that collisions between two condensate atoms in the @xmath0 state can produce one atom in the @xmath1 and one atom in the @xmath2 , with sufficient kinetic energy to escape the trap @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this scheme produced pairs of atoms entangled in atomic spin . in the second scheme a bec of molecules composed of bosonic atoms",
    "is disassociated to produce twin atomic beams , analogous to optical down conversion @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the beams were entangled in the sense that phase and amplitude measurements on one beam could infer phase and amplitude measurements of the other beam better than the heisenberg limit .",
    "although each atomic pair is perfectly correlated in direction in each of these schemes , there is very little control of direction of each pair , so the spectral flux would be limited .",

    "the finite momentum spread of a trapped condensate means that there will be a broadening of the time taken to leave the outcoupling region , and hence ideal transfer will not be possible . to determine the effectiveness of the quantum state transfer , we require a multimode model that takes into account back coupling and the finite momentum spread of the condensate .    in section",
    "ii we describe an atom laser beam made by outcoupling from a bec using a non - trivial optical mode , using the simplest possible model that contains the spatial effects in the output mode .",

    "<S> we examine the properties of an atom laser produced by outcoupling from a bose - einstein condensate with squeezed light . </S>",
    "<S> we model the multimode dynamics of the output field and show that a significant amount of squeezing can be transfered from an optical mode to a propagating atom laser beam . </S>",
    "<S> we use this to demonstrate that two - mode squeezing can be used to produce twin atom laser beams with continuous variable entanglement in amplitude and phase . </S>"
