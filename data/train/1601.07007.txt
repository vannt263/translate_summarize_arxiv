    "in nucleate boiling , a very large rate of heat transfer from the heating surface to the bulk is due to both the phase change ( latent heat of vaporization ) and the fact that the superheated liquid is carried away from the heating surface by the departing vapor bubbles .",
    "therefore , the knowledge of the nucleation and growth of the bubbles on the heating surface is very important for the calculations of the heat transfer rate .",
    "many works were focused on the bubble growth kinetics , see e.g. @xcite . however , as it was recently recognized @xcite , the behavior of the fluid in contact with the solid heater remains poorly studied .",
    "we think that this situation is due to the success of the microlayer model @xcite that proved to be self - sufficient for the description of the bubble growth kinetics and the heat transfer rate .",
    "the microlayer model postulates the existence of a thin liquid film between the heater and the foot of the vapor bubble .",
    "this model is based on observations of the bubbles at low system pressures with respect to the critical pressure for the given fluid .",
    "at low pressures , the fast bubble growth creates a hydrodynamic resistance that makes the bubble almost hemispherical @xcite . as proved by direct observations @xcite through the transparent heating surface , the dry spot",
    "( i.e. the spot of the direct contact between the liquid and the vapor ) does exist around the nucleation site while the bubble stays near the heating surface .",
    "the origin of the dry spot can be explained as follows .",
    "first , it is necessary that the vapor - solid adhesion exists to avert the immediate removal of the bubble from the heater by the lift - off forces .",
    "this adhesion only appears when the vapor contacts the solid directly .",
    "second , the strong generation of vapor at the triple contact line around the nucleation site prevents covering of the nucleation site by the liquid . as a consequence ,",
    "the existence of the dry spot under the bubble is necessary during most of the time of the bubble growth , until the bubble departure from the heater .    because of the hemispheric bubble shape ,",
    "the apparent bubble foot is much larger than the dry spot .",
    "that is why the microlayer model works so well at low pressures . for high system pressure , comparable to the critical pressure ( see @xcite for the discussion of the threshold between these two regimes )",
    ", the picture is different .",
    "the bubble growth is much slower so that the hydrodynamic forces are small with respect to the surface tension .",
    "consequently , the bubble resembles a sphere much more than a hemisphere @xcite .",
    "it is very hard to identify the microlayer as a thin film in this case . in this article",
    "we will limit ourselves to this particular case .",
    "one of the most important phenomena in boiling at the large heat fluxes used in industrial heat exchangers is the boiling crisis called alternately `` burnout '' , `` departure from nucleate boiling '' , or `` critical heat flux '' ( chf ) @xcite .",
    "when the heat flux from the heater exceeds a critical value ( the chf ) , the vapor bubbles abruptly form a film that thermally insulates the heater surface from the liquid .",
    "consequently , the temperature of the heater rapidly grows .",
    "the dry spot is recognized as playing a key role in the boiling crisis @xcite . a new physical approach @xcite",
    "was recently suggested by some of us to describe this phenomenon .",
    "it is based on the experimental results @xcite that show that the boiling crisis can begin with the fast growth of a dry spot under a _ single _ bubble , although several simultaneously spreading bubbles can coalesce later on .",
    "the model associates the onset of the boiling crisis with the beginning of the spreading of the dry spot below a vapor bubble attached to the heater surface .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to rigorously calculate in 2d the temporal evolution of the dry spot under a single bubble .",
    "two main difficulties arise while solving this problem .",
    "the first of them is the necessity to solve the full free - boundary problem for the bubble .",
    "unfortunately , we can not assume a simple shape for the bubble foot as has been done in all previous simulations of the vapor bubble growth that we are aware of , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the reason is that these models do not rigorously determine the size of the dry spot .",
    "instead , they use an empirical correlation for the microlayer parameters chosen to satisfy the experimentally observed growth rate of the bubble . in the present formulation , the dry spot size is determined in a self - consistent manner from the position of the triple contact line .",
    "such a free - boundary problem is difficult because of its non - linearity and can be solved by only a few numerical methods , e.g. boundary element method ( bem ) @xcite or front tracking method .",
    "the latter was recently used @xcite to simulate the film boiling in 2d .",
    "the second difficulty of the dry spot problem is associated with the calculation of the heat transfer in the most important region  the vicinity of the triple contact line ( i.e. the microlayer ) .",
    "it is analyzed analytically in the subsection [ ssw ] for two fixed values of the contact angle .",
    "although these results are not used in the numerical simulation , we need them to check the accuracy of the heat transfer calculation in this important region .",
    "our calculations are valid in the simplified situation where the hydrodynamic effects in liquid are neglected .",
    "this simplification is justified by the slow growth assumption valid for high system pressures .",
    "this approximation is common @xcite for the thermal diffusion - controlled bubble growth . the only dynamic condition that can not be neglected @xcite is the dynamic balance of mechanical momentum at the bubble interface that results in the vapor recoil pressure .",
    "this approach allows us to apply the quasi - static approximation for the bubble shape determination in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] and neglect the convection terms in the heat transfer problem that is discussed in sec .",
    "the numerical algorithm is described in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "the results of the simulation and the conclusions are presented in sections [ sec7 ] and [ sec8 ] .",
    "when the heat flux @xmath65 from the heater is small , the vapor bubble grows with its triple vapor - liquid - solid contact line pinned by the surface defect on which the vapor nucleation has started .",
    "the size of the dry spot is thus very small with respect to the bubble size . according to the model @xcite that should be valid for any system pressure , at some value of @xmath65 the contact line depins and spreads under the influence of the vapor recoil pressure @xmath38 , @xmath66 where @xmath14 is the mass of the evaporated liquid per unit time per unit area of the vapor - liquid interface .",
    "@xmath38 may vary along the interface and is directed normally to this interface towards the liquid @xcite . by neglecting heat conduction in the vapor with respect to the latent heat effect , @xmath14 can be related to the local heat flux across the interface @xmath67 by the equation @xmath68 where @xmath18 is the latent heat of vaporization .",
    "because of the strong temperature gradient in the vicinity of the heating surface , @xmath67 increases sharply near the contact line , and consequently @xmath14 and @xmath38 also increase . in other words ,",
    "the pressure increases near the contact line and causes it to recede .",
    "therefore , the dry spot under the bubble should grow with time .",
    "the bubble shape is determined using a quasi - static approximation .",
    "we neglect all but two forces that define the bubble shape : the surface tension and the vapor recoil pressure @xmath38 defined by eq .",
    "the bubble shape is then defined by the pressure balance ( see @xcite ) @xmath69 where @xmath26 is the local curvature of the bubble , @xmath25 is the vapor - liquid interface tension and @xmath19 is a constant difference of pressures between the vapor and the liquid .",
    "@xmath19 should be determined using the known volume @xmath58 of the 2d bubble . at any time",
    ", the volume @xmath58 of the 2d bubble ( see appendix [ a1 ] ) can be written as : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the vapor - liquid interface , and the external unit normal vector @xmath72 to the bubble is defined in a cartesian @xmath73 coordinate system .",
    "an axisymmetric bubble shape is assumed in the following , see fig .",
    "[ bubble ] .",
    "it is convenient to describe the bubble shape in parametric form while choosing a non - dimensional length @xmath21 measured along the bubble contour as an independent variable . then the coordinates @xmath73 for a given point on the bubble interface are functions of @xmath21 that varies along the bubble half - contour ( its right half in fig .  [ bubble ] ) from 0 to 1 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 corresponding to the topmost point of the bubble and to the contact point respectively .",

    "the solution of the problem ( [ pr ]  [ l ] ) allows the bubble shape to be determined providing the heat flux through the vapor - liquid interface is known .",
    "the calculation of the heat transfer around a growing vapor bubble is a free boundary problem . to our knowledge",
    ", only two other groups have solved the full free - boundary boiling problem @xcite . in both works the singular effects , which appear in the region adjacent to the triple contact line ( microlayer ) , are not discussed .",
    "however , we know that almost all the heat flux supplied to the vapor bubble goes through this particular region , a region on which we concentrate in this work . as a first step , we neglect the heat transfer due to the liquid motion . thermal conduction and the latent heat effects",
    "are taken into account to describe the time evolution of the 2d vapor bubble .",
    "the vapor is assumed to be non - conducting .",
    "the case of saturated boiling is considered .",
    "this means that the temperature in the liquid far from the heater is equal to @xmath82 , the saturation temperature for the given system pressure .",
    "thus only evaporation is allowed on the bubble interface .",
    "since we consider a slow process with no liquid motion , the pressures are assumed to be uniform both in the vapor and in the liquid .",
    "however , they are different according to ( [ surf ] ) where @xmath19 is the difference between the pressures inside and outside the vapor bubble .",
    "the saturation temperature @xmath83 for the vapor inside the bubble depends on the vapor pressure according to the clausius - clapeyron equation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath84.\\ ] ] since @xmath85 is the bubble radius at the top of the bubble ( where @xmath38 is negligible ) , it is easy to estimate that the correction to @xmath82 is less than @xmath86% even for the smallest bubble size considered . therefore , in the following , the bubble surface is supposed to be at constant temperature @xmath82 .",
    "first of all , we need to understand how @xmath67 behaves in the vicinity of the contact line where the contour of the bubble @xmath71 can be approximated by a straight line that forms an angle @xmath17 with the @xmath87 heater line , see fig .",
    ". then @xmath67 can be obtained from the solution of a simple two - dimensional problem of unsteady heat conduction in this wedge of liquid , the point @xmath88 corresponding to the contact line . in our previous article @xcite the model problem was solved to show that when @xmath89 and a constant heat flux from the heater is imposed , the heat flux through the liquid - vapor interface @xmath67 diverges weakly ( logarithmically ) near the contact line . in the present work we treat two cases @xmath90 and",
    "@xmath91 which also allow an analytical treatment .    the heat conduction equation for the temperature @xmath92 in the liquid @xmath93 has the initial and boundary conditions @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the thermal conductivity and the thermal diffusivity of the liquid , and the heat flux @xmath65 from the heating surface is assumed to be constant ( @xmath97 ) for the case of the thin heating wall .",
    "the solution of this 2d problem for the angles @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is integer , can be obtained using the method of images @xcite for the green function .",
    "for @xmath90 it reads @xmath100 where the function @xmath101 is a solution for this problem at @xmath49 @xmath102 , \\label{tinf}\\ ] ] erfc@xmath103 being the complementary error function @xcite . then the heat flux @xmath67 @xmath104 can be calculated as a function of @xmath1 using the expression for the unit normal vector @xmath105 : @xmath106 it is easy to see that , unlike the problem @xcite for @xmath89 , the heat flux remains finite at the contact line ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "this is also true for the case @xmath91 , for which @xmath108 and @xmath109 . \\label{ql8}\\ ] ]    although these solutions present important benchmarks for the numerical calculations of the heat transfer near the contact line , they can not be used in the simulation itself for two reasons .",
    "the first is the impossibility to employ the uniform heat flux boundary condition ( [ qconst ] ) because in reality the heat flux vary strongly between the dry and wetted parts of the solid surface .",
    "in particular , the heat flux through the dry spot under a bubble is very small ( we assume it to be zero in the following ) . the second reason is the impossibility to approximate the bubble contour by a straight line for the case @xmath81 , most important for the industrial applications .",
    "we consider the growth of a vapor bubble on the semi - infinite ( @xmath110 ) solid heater @xmath111 in the semi - infinite ( @xmath112 ) liquid @xmath113 , see fig .",
    "[ bubble ] .",
    "we assume that no superheat is needed for the bubble nucleation so that the circular bubble of the radius @xmath50 and the volume @xmath114 has already nucleated at the heater surface at @xmath115 .",
    "the validity of this assumption is discussed in sec .",

    "the formulated mathematical problem can be solved by the boundary element method ( bem ) generalized for moving boundary problems @xcite . before its direct application",

    "obviously , they should contain @xmath71 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 and a circle that closes the contours at infinity .",
    "the non - zero values of the temperature and flux at infinity complicates the solution .",

    "the resulting modified variables are zero at infinity .",
    "this transformation allows the integration contour to be reduced to @xmath129 .",

    "it is worth mentioning that if @xmath136 , a constant @xmath45 satisfies this integral equation .",
    "this means that in the bubble growth problem with this choice of @xmath116 the heat flux from the heater would remain constant at least far from the growing bubble .",

    "as calculated in the kinetic theory of gases @xmath201 in our model the above divergence appears because of the assumption that the temperature remains constant along the vapor - liquid interface . in reality , this assumption is violated in the very close vicinity of the contact point where the heat flux @xmath67 is comparable to @xmath200 . thus we accept the following approximation for the function @xmath199 , @xmath202 .",
    "it is extrapolated using the power law @xmath203 until it reaches the value of @xmath200 and remains constant while @xmath21 increases to unity .",
    "this extrapolation is used to calculate the integrals in ( [ vn ] ) and ( [ prn ] ) .",
    "there is no need to modify the constant - temperature boundary condition for the heat transfer calculations because the calculated heat flux @xmath67 remains always less than @xmath200 .",
    "the calculations show that the function @xmath199 ( see fig .",
    "[ q_l ] ) can be described well by the above power law where @xmath204 grows slightly with time .",
    "we note that for the growing bubble the divergence is stronger than for the @xmath205 wedge analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the difference between these two cases is the behavior of the heat flux @xmath206 in the vicinity of the contact point .",
    "while it was supposed to be uniform for the @xmath205 wedge , the function @xmath207 increases strongly near the contact point for the growing bubble case , see the discussion associated with fig .",
    "[ qt_s ] .",
    "sometimes , an occasional  bump \" on the @xmath199 curve appears during the iteration of the steps 37 of the algorithm because of inaccurate calculation of the bubble shape when the automatically chosen number of the boundary elements in the vicinity of the contact line is too small .",
    "this bump disappears during at most three time steps .",
    "this disappearance indicates a good numerical stability of the algorithm .",
    "when the bubble evolution is exceedingly slow , it may be necessary to increase the time step several times . while not influencing accuracy strongly ( this is an intrinsic property of the bem @xcite ) , such a change decreases the temporal resolution .",
    "there is a number of new results that we have obtained from this simulation .",
    "the most important is the time evolution of the dry spot under the vapor bubble . at low heat flux",
    ", the shape of the bubble stays nearly spherical ( fig .",
    "[ shape]a ) until it leaves the heating surface under the action of gravity or hydrodynamic drag forces .",
    "[ shape]b shows that at large heat flux the radius of the dry spot can approach the bubble radius during its evolution , thus confirming previous theoretical predictions @xcite where the apparent contact angle grow with time .",
    "it should be emphasized that the _ actual _ contact angle remains zero during the evolution , see sec .",
    "the large _ apparent _ contact angle is due to the strong change in slope of the bubble contour near the contact line where the vapor recoil force is very large ( see @xcite for the advanced discussion ) .",
    "the temporal evolution of the radius @xmath208 of the dry spot is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dry_t ] , where the time evolution of @xmath209 is shown .",
    "@xmath47 is the visible bubble radius defined as the maximum abscissa for the points of the bubble contour as shown in fig .",
    "[ bubble ] .",
    "note that @xmath210 by definition . at low heat fluxes",
    "@xmath211 kw / m@xmath212 @xmath208 stays very small during a long time interval ( see fig .  [",
    "shape]a ) . in this regime",
    "the bubble should leave the heater quickly because of the small adhesion that is proportional to the contact line length .",
    "after a transition time @xmath213 which depends on @xmath214 , the growth of the dry spot accelerates steeply ( see fig .  [ dry_t ] ) .",
    "this time @xmath213 corresponds to the moment where the growing vapor recoil force becomes comparable to the surface tension .",
    "this force balance was analyzed in details in @xcite , where numerical estimates were given .",
    "the dependence @xmath215 is presented in fig .  [ time ] . clearly , @xmath213 is a decreasing function of @xmath214 .",
    "this means that , at a sufficiently large @xmath45 , the dry spot becomes very large in a short time and the departure of the bubble is prevented because of the large adhesion to the heater . during the further growth this bubble can either create alone a nucleus for the film boiling or coalesce with another similarly spreading neighboring bubble",
    "therefore , we can associate this value of @xmath45 with the @xmath43 . without a careful analysis of the time of departure ,",
    "it is not possible to determine a precise value for @xmath43",
    ". this will be the subject of future studies .",
    "we neglected the initial superheating for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the initial superheating would accelerate the bubble growth slightly in the initial stages that are not important for the dry spot spreading that becomes significant later on .",
    "slight oscillations in the dry spot growth are clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ dry_t ] , especially in the fast growth regime .",
    "we varied the numerical discretization parameters in order to check whether these oscillations appear due to a numerical instability .",
    "neither the amplitude nor frequency of the oscillations depends on numerical discretization parameters .",
    "we conclude that the oscillations reflect a physical effect ( see below ) rather than a numerical artifact .",
    "the kinetics of the bubble growth is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rad ] , where the temporal evolution of the bubble radius @xmath47 is presented . at @xmath216",
    "we recover a general tendency of the bubble growth curves ( see , e. g. @xcite ) , where @xmath217 . at @xmath218",
    "the growth exponent is larger .",
    "the curve @xmath219 exhibits oscillations with their amplitude increasing with time .",
    "we suspect that this effect appears when the temperature distribution in the heater responds too slowly to maintain the fast growth rate in the bubble .",
    "our simulation enables the heat transfer under the bubble to be rigorously calculated .",
    "the variation of the heat flux @xmath206 along the heating surface is shown in figs .",
    "[ qt_s]a , b for the different values of the heat flux @xmath45 .",
    "the value of @xmath206 on the liquid side in the vicinity of the contact line turns out to be very close to @xmath220 , the heat flux that produces evaporation on the vapor - liquid interface and that diverges on the contact line ( see figs .",
    "[ q_l ] ) .",
    "this correspondence was expected , because all the heat flux supplied by the heater to the foot of the bubble is consummated to evaporate the liquid , in agreement with the  liquid microlayer \" models . since @xmath206 is zero ( cf .",
    "( [ qs0 ] ) ) if the contact line is approached from the dry spot side , the function @xmath207 is discontinuous in the vicinity of the contact point .",
    "far from the bubble @xmath221 as it should be .",
    "the variation of the temperature along the heating surface @xmath222 is also shown in figs .",
    "far from the bubble , @xmath127 has to increase with time independently of @xmath1 and follows a square root law according to ( [ tsinf0 ] ) .",
    "it decreases to @xmath82 near the contact point because the temperature should be equal to @xmath82 on the whole vapor - liquid interface , according to the imposed boundary condition .",
    "[ qt_s ] demonstrate that there is a zone of lowered temperature around the bubble , in agreement with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "inside the dry spot , @xmath223 increases with time sharply because the heat transfer through the dry spot is blocked .",
    "[ qt_s]b shows that at high heat flux and @xmath224 the temperature inside the dry spot becomes larger than the temperature far from the bubble .",
    "this temperature increase leads to eventual burnout of the heater observed during the boiling crisis .",
    "the presence of singularities in the functions @xmath222 and @xmath207 is the reason for our choice of the boundary conditions on the heating surface in the form ( [ qs0],[ts0 ] ) . as a matter of fact , an application of the conditions of the uniform heat flux or uniform temperature would lead to the physically inconsistent results such as non - integrable divergency of @xmath220 at the contact line .",
    "we note that an error in the calculation of @xmath220 should strongly influence the results for the dry spot dynamics .",
    "the 2d free - boundary simulation allows us to calculate the actual bubble shape and the variation of the temperatures and fluxes along the vapor - liquid , vapor - solid , and liquid - solid interfaces .",
    "the description of the heat transfer in the vicinity of the triple contact line presents the most difficult part of the problem .",
    "our variation of the boundary element method is capable of adequately describing it .",
    "our main result is the evidence for the growth of the dry spot under the vapor bubble .",
    "while this increase is very slow in the beginning of the bubble growth , it accelerates steeply after a growth time @xmath59 that depends on the external heat supply . at low heat supply",
    ", @xmath59 is very large so that the bubble can grow large enough to satisfy the conditions for departure from the heating surface _ before _",
    "the dry spot becomes significant .",
    "in contrast , at high heat supply , @xmath59 is small so that the dry spot grows very rapidly which means that the bubble spreads over the heating surface .",
    "although our analysis is limited to the case of high system pressures , we note that at low pressures this effect can also be important because the forces of dynamical origin `` press '' the bubble against the heater , thus favoring its spreading .",
    "the results of this simulations thus confirm the validity of the `` drying transition '' model suggested in @xcite to describe the boiling crisis .",
    "unfortunately , observations of the bubble shape and the dry spot growth during boiling at high pressures and high heat fluxes are unknown to us , preventing a direct comparison of our results with the experimental data .",
    "we note , however , that the growth of the dry spot immediately before the boiling crisis was observed in @xcite , where observations have been carried out through a transparent heating surface .",
    "the authors of @xcite state that  when the heat flux is sufficiently large , suddenly at some point on the heating surface a dry area is not wetted and starts growing , leading to burnout \" .",
