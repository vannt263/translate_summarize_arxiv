    "the friedel sum rule provides a method for getting information about polarization charge due to an external charge impurity in the system@xcite .",

    "we analyze the friedel sum rule in a gapless graphene cone in the presence of an external coulomb charge@xcite .",
    "the strength of the external coulomb charge introduced in graphene can be classified as either subcritical or supercritical .",
    "the critical value of the coulomb charge corresponds to a situation beyond which the system becomes quantum mechanically unstable@xcite and this leads to the fall to the centre@xcite phenomenon .",
    "graphene , experimentally fabricated in @xmath5@xcite , provides an ideal laboratory to study this phenomenon .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dirac type quasiparticles in graphene have a fermi velocity which is approximately @xmath6 times smaller than the velocity of light .",
    "thus the supercriticality is easily reached in graphene in presence of a relatively small external coulomb charge impurity @xmath7@xcite and the atomic collapse@xcite in this region leads to the formation of quasibound states .",
    "recently such quasibound states have been observed experimentally@xcite in gapless planer graphene . in this paper",
    "we study the supercritical coulomb impurity in graphene in presence of a conical defect .",

    ". the holonomies due to topological defects@xcite can be realized by introducing a suitable flux tube passing through the origin@xcite .",
    "we are thus lead to study the combined effect of the flux tube potential and the external coulomb charge on graphene .",
    "in addition to the supercritical region we analyze our system thoroughly for the subcritical values of the coulomb charge . in the subcritical region for a certain range of system parameters we found that a single real parameter is required for labeling the boundary conditions at the location of the defects . to understand the physical origin of such a parameter we recall that the coulomb charge as well as the conical defect can give rise to short range interactions in graphene .",
    "such interactions can not be directly incorporated in the dirac equation as the latter is valid only in the low energy or long - wavelength limit .",
    "however the combined effect of such short range interactions can be encoded in the boundary conditions@xcite by the parameter .",
    "this additional real parameter ensures current conservation leading to a self - adjoint hamiltonian and unitary evolution of the quantum system@xcite .",
    "we show that the scattering phase shift and consequently @xmath4 depend explicitly on this parameter labeling the boundary conditions in the graphene cone .",
    "this parameter is determined empirically as it can not be obtained by theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we set up the friedel sum rule for gapless graphene cone with a point charge at the apex .",
    "then the analysis of the spectrum is done in the subcritical region , where we obtain the scattering phase shifts and change in the number of states and show how these physical quantities depend explicitly on the sample topology .",
    "after that we discuss the effect of generalized boundary conditions on the spectrum . in the next section the analysis of the corresponding spectrum is done in the supercritical region .",

    "the edges of the removed sector are identified , the angular boundary condition obeyed by the dirac spinor is modified . due to the identification of the two edges of the removed sector",
    "the frame @xmath17 becomes discontinuous across the joining line .",
    "therefore we choose a new set of frames which is rotated with respect to the old frame @xmath18 by an angle @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the effect of the conical topology can be equivalently described by introducing a magnetic flux tube passing through the centre of the plane graphene sheet .",
    "the magnetic vector potential associated with the flux tube replaces the ordinary derivatives in the hamiltonian by the corresponding covariant derivatives .",
