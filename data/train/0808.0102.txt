    "since the early days of quantum theory , there has been a considerable effort to formulate the principles of thermodynamics from a quantum perspective @xcite . recently",
    ", this approach has allowed to discover novel features of the nature of many - body systems , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular ,",
    "careful analysis of the application of thermodynamics concepts to microscopic systems have shown the appearance of purely quantum features . in such systems , thermodynamic magnitudes may indeed loose their classical properties , giving rise to peculiar dependencies on some system parameters , such as size or total energy . a striking manifestation of this is given by the temperature",
    ", a magnitude considered to be intensive in classical thermodynamics . in a quantum scenario the temperature may not be well defined , resulting in the fact that subparts of thermal states may no longer be described as thermal states with the same global temperature as the whole system .",
    "more precisely , recent studies suggest that the intensive nature of the temperature may be lost not only in dependence of the size of the system subparts , as in a classical scenario , but also changing the temperature of the global system @xcite .",
    "it is then a relevant question to understand under which conditions the concept of temperature offers a correct description of sub - parts of quantum thermal states .",
    "although the main motivation of this work comes from a fundamental point of view , studying the limits of validity of thermodynamics concepts may be relevant from a practical perspective .",
    "in fact , recent experimental progress in nano - sciences allows to access thermodynamical quantities , like temperature , at scales in which deviations from classical thermodynamics may become relevant @xcite .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been pointed out that the breakdown of the concept of temperature might have consequences on thermometry and might be observed in experiments with spin chain compounds .    in refs .",
    "@xcite a set of conditions were established in order to assure that a large thermal system can be approximated by a set of _ factorized _ blocks , each of them described in turn by a thermal state at the same temperature as the global system . clearly , when such an approximation is valid , local measurements performed on a block provide results compatible with the global temperature . in other words",
    ", we do meet a situation in which temperature is intensive .",
    "however , local measurements on a single block do not provide any information about the correlations with the other blocks , which are simply disregarded ( traced out ) in the measuring process .",
    "therefore , the approximation in refs .",
    "@xcite may be further relaxed still retrieving situations compatible with the concept of intensive temperature . as a matter of fact",
    ", one may only require that the block actually measured should be in a thermal state at the same temperature as the global one , not necessarily factorized with the rest of the system .",
    "this is the approach adopted in this work .",
    "the aim of the present work is to consider these issues exploiting ideas and tools recently emerged from quantum information science .",
    "this approach has the advantage of giving a thorough description of the quantum systems under consideration , allowing in turn to characterize in detail the departure from the classical behavior .",
    "we consider a chain composed by @xmath0 spins ( where @xmath0 can be taken in the macroscopic limit ) at temperature @xmath1 and focus on the thermodynamical properties of a block composed by @xmath2 spins ( @xmath3 )  _ i.e. _ , the reduced state obtained after tracing out @xmath4 spins . in a standard thermodynamic setting @xmath2 and @xmath0 are taken large enough such that the interactions between the block and the rest of the system may be disregarded . as a consequence",
    ", the block can be well described by a thermal state at the same temperature as the global one .",
    "however , such a picture may brake down for blocks of small size and strong interactions . as said , whereas for classical systems this breakdown has no dependence on the temperature , in quantum systems a temperature dependence arises @xcite .",
    "this is the scenario that we will consider here .",
    "to face this problem we use the quantum fidelity as a figure of merit .",
    "the latter quantifies the amount of statistical distinguishability between two quantum states and its properties have been widely studied in quantum information science @xcite .",
    "recently , the fidelity has been used both as an indicator of phase transitions in spins systems @xcite , and to study the emergence of thermal states in contiguous blocks of some spin - system ground states  @xcite .",
    "as shown in these works , the fidelity has revealed to be a particularly sensitive figure of merit in this framework . here",
    ", we use it to check whether the reduced states of the spin chain under consideration can be well approximated by an @xmath2-particle thermal state .",
    "the sensitivity of this approach will be assessed by investigating regions in the phase space near the zero - temperature critical points .",
    "we also relate our investigations to recent findings in the foundation of statistical mechanics  again inspired by quantum information concepts . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors address typical properties of the reduced states obtained by tracing out a huge amount of degrees of freedom from a constrained pure system .",
    "building on previous results on properties of quantum states in large dimensional systems  @xcite , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the reduced state of a big system ( including environment ) satisfying an operator constraint is basically the same for almost any pure state of the system . in the particular case",
    "in which ( i ) the operator constraint is related to the energy of the whole system and ( ii ) the interaction between system and environment is small , this typical state can be shown to correspond to a canonical thermal state  @xcite , as already pointed out in the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results we study the reduced states of the chain from a thermodynamical perspective , describing it with only a few physical magnitudes , an effective temperature in our case . in other words , we check whether the reduced states of thermal systems maintain some sort of canonical typicality . recall that the results in refs .",
    "@xcite show that a canonical thermal state for the reduced system is obtained when the interaction energy between the considered parts is negligible . as said , here we will consider settings in which such condition is not fulfilled , hence the validity of these typicality results is by no means guaranteed . specifically , we proceed by identifying the thermal state of @xmath2 particles that , subject to the local interaction inherited by the whole hamiltonian , is closer to the actual reduced state of the whole chain .",
    "we thus define an effective _ local _ temperature ( the only free parameter to adjust ) that can be compared with the _ global _ temperature of the whole system . depending on the parameters of the hamiltonian and the subsystem size we find situations where the local temperature is no longer equal to that of the global system , in accordance with the above mentioned analysis .",
    "however , the description of the reduced states as thermal states is an extremely good approximation , as shown by the corresponding fidelity . this is remarkable since , as said , we are not in the standard conditions considered in refs .",
    "our results then suggest that some form of canonical typicality may still be present , even if the interaction between system and environment is not negligible .",
    "in particular , we find that below some threshold temperature the local temperature may become higher than the global one , and that the reduced states can have some finite temperature even when the global system is in the ground state .",
    "furthermore , as one may expect , the local and global temperatures tend to coincide increasing the size of the subsystem .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "after introducing the systems under consideration , we calculate in section [ s : intensive_t ] the fidelity between two - particle blocks and the corresponding thermal state .",
    "this allows to study the conditions under which the temperature ceases to be an intensive magnitude .",
    "then , in section [ local ] , we derive the local effective temperature of the two - particle blocks , as well as the fidelity of this description .",
    "the dependence of the local temperature on the size of the blocks is studied in section [ larger ] , where blocks consisting of more than two spins are studied with the help of the matrix product states formalism . finally , we summarize our results in section [ esco ] and point out some conclusive remarks .",

    "we apply the above considerations to a 1-d spin chain characterized by the ising hamiltonian in a transverse field with open boundary conditions @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath18 gives the strength of an external magnetic field .",

    "the minimal size for which both the terms in the hamiltonian ( [ ising ] ) contribute to the construction of @xmath9 is for @xmath27 .",
    "we then devote much attention to this first non - trivial case of two - spin blocks .",
    "furthermore , it is reasonable to expect that , if for such small blocks the temperature is intensive , it will be intensive for larger blocks as well .",
    "this intuition will be confirmed in section [ larger ] , where the size dependence of our considerations will be analyzed .    before proceeding with the results ,",
    "let us comment about our choice of the local hamiltonian @xmath28 , from which the reference state @xmath29 is derived . with this choice",
    "we are at first sight disregarding the interaction between the @xmath30-spin block and the rest of the system .",
    "whereas this may be easily justified in the case of large @xmath2 and @xmath0 , it deserves to be clarified in our setting .",
    "in fact , we considered various strategies in order to take into account the interactions at the border of the block , in particular a mean - field approach , and the limit of high temperatures .",
    "first , one may add to @xmath28 a correction term which takes into account the surrounding spins of the block following a mean - field approach .",
    "the idea is to replace the operators at the boundaries by their mean value @xmath31 , so the corresponding effective two - particle hamiltonian reads @xmath32 the boundary correction term however turns out be zero for any finite temperature , as @xmath33 .",
    "this can be seen by considering that the canonical distribution @xmath6 inherits the symmetries of the ising hamiltonian , in particular the global spin - flip symmetry @xmath34 . as a consequence",

    "@xcite ) . however , recall that a symmetry breaking can occur at @xmath40 , resulting in @xmath41 .",
    "second , one could consider a correction valid for high temperatures .",
    "a first order expansion for @xmath42 immediately reveals that in this limit @xmath25 is given by @xmath43 since the pauli matrices appearing in the interacting terms of @xmath8 are traceless .",
    "the expression above for @xmath25 coincides with the high - t expansion of @xmath29 . in other words , for high temperatures the standard situation is retrieved , and no correction has to be taken into account .    in order to further clarify our choice of the local hamiltonian , let us consider the classical antiferromagnetic one - dimensional ising model , given by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "notice that the model above gives the classical limit of @xmath8 for the case @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to briefly consider this example since it gives a relevant classical model whose local hamiltonian contains no correction due to the boundary terms . to show this ,",
    "let us consider the thermal state associated to hamiltonian ( [ ising_classical ] ) , described by a thermal probability distribution : @xmath47 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the partition function .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that , by summing over all the possible configuration of the @xmath48 spins surrounding an arbitrary @xmath30 spin block , one obtains the following distribution function : @xmath49 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is arbitrary ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 is the local hamiltonian and @xmath53 its respective partition function .",
    "as said , we see that for this kind of classical system no correction due to the boundary terms is expected .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] that , as @xmath37 increases , the maximum of the derivative gets more pronounced .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] also increases as the temperature decreases .",
    "this behavior proceeds until we reach some @xmath37 , which corresponds to some effective ground state , and below which additional changes are hardly observed .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the temperature dependence in the correlators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr4 ] ) . for large @xmath37 , one can well approximate @xmath58 , so the reduced states become almost independent of the temperature .",
    "the derived magnitudes computed from the reduced states exhibit for this reason minor changes below some temperature .",
    "the above considerations can be extended as well to two spins separated by @xmath22 particles in the chain .",

    "we have seen in the preceding section that , for some values of the hamiltonian parameters and the temperature , a two - particle block of a thermal state may be different from a two - particle thermal state under the same hamiltonian at the same temperature .",
    "now , we focus on the reduced state @xmath72 and look for a valid description of it in terms of only a few thermodynamic magnitudes . a key point in the attempt to describe the reduced states is the fact that , under some natural circumstances , they will become with high probability close to a thermal state @xcite .",
    "this follows from the general structure of the hilbert space of the global system , and the restriction over the total energy @xcite . in this direction ,",
    "the results in refs .",
    "@xcite are quite general but their application to a specific system has to be taken cautiously . in particular , a thermal state is recovered when the interaction between the parts of the system under consideration is negligible with respect to the interactions inside the parts themselves .",
    "this condition , however , may not always be satisfied .",
    "when the parts taken into account are composed of two spins only , as analyzed in the previous section , it is then non trivial that the reduced states are actually in a thermal state of their respective hamiltonian .",
    "nonetheless , we will see that this is indeed the case in the majority of the circumstances .    following these considerations we check whether the reduced state is a thermal state as well , _ but at an effective local temperature _ different from the one of the global system .",
    "that is , even if the temperature may not be intensive , the reduced states may still have a simple thermodynamical description .",
    "to this end , we consider a generic @xmath2-particle thermal state @xmath73 and look for the effective optimal temperature @xmath74 for which such a state better describes the actual @xmath2-particle reduced state @xmath5 . as outlined in the previous section , we assume that the local interaction @xmath10 is the same as in the global system @xmath8 ( actually @xmath10 is obtained from @xmath8 by tracing out the @xmath4 disregarded spins ) , we only have to adjust the temperature . in order to check the quality of this description , we compute the fidelity between the reduced state and the reference thermal state , and then optimize the temperature of the latter .",

    "[ fig : fig8 ] , we have that @xmath80 for low values of @xmath37 ( _ i.e. _ , the local temperature is the same as the global one ) .",

    ", the reduced state keeps the same effective temperature , even in conditions of zero-@xmath1 where the whole chain is in its ground state . as above",

    "in the previous sections we mainly discussed reduced blocks consisting of two spins , not necessarily contiguous .",
    "now , we extend our considerations to larger blocks . recall that in the case of two - particle blocks we considered the whole system in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath95 ) and were able to construct the density matrix of the block via the two - body correlators in eqs .",

    "even if such a procedure can be in principle extended to higher order correlators ( for the 3-spin correlators see for instance @xcite ) , it is more convenient to use a different strategy when blocks of arbitrary length are considered .",
    "specifically , we use the formalism of matrix product states ( mps ) , a numerical tool which has been shown to describe with high precision ground and thermal states of 1d local hamiltonians . using the mps formalism for mixed states",
    "@xcite we construct thermal states and compute correlation functions in an efficient way . within the adopted numerical approach , we can not work directly in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "however , the mps formalism allows to simulate systems large enough to accurately reproduce the thermodynamical limit .",
    "we checked that systems composed by around @xmath96 spins already suffice to obtain results indistinguishable to the corresponding ones in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "we will explicitly show in the following such a comparison .",
    "the interest in considering blocks of increasing size is motivated by the following observations . on the one hand ,",
    "when the block increases in size the interaction between the latter and the rest of the system becomes less relevant when compared with the interactions inside the block itself .",
    "this may intuitively lead to guess that the rest of the system plays a negligible role in the thermalization process .",
    "in other words , each block in which the global system may be divided could be considered as a system on its own , thus thermalizing with the global environment independently from the rest .",
    "in such a scenario the temperature would clearly be intensive , for large enough block size .",
    "on the other hand , there are situations in which it is not possible to disregard any part of the whole system , in particular when the latter is in a highly correlated state ( _ e.g. _ , near a phase transition ) .",
    "thus , an analysis of the intensive nature of temperature as a function of the system size can identify which of these two tendencies prevails and in which setting .    before proceeding , let us briefly recall the mps formalism ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this representation is based on a set of matrices @xmath97 of size @xmath98 used to write a quantum state as @xmath99 we can write mixed states in the mps formalism introducing at each position an ancillary system @xmath100 of dimension @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the thermal state @xmath102 is written as a pure state in a hilbert space of larger dimension as @xmath103 using this purification one can recover the thermal state tracing out the ancillary systems @xmath100 , @xmath104 .    with this representation we can compute expectation values efficiently using the relation @xmath105 where @xmath106 , and the set of matrices @xmath107 are the result of tracing the ancilla states @xmath108    with an initial mps representation of a state at @xmath109 , which corresponds to the completely mixed state @xmath110 , we obtain the state @xmath111 using @xmath112 where @xmath113 . in this way the thermal state at temperature",
    "@xmath37 is the result of the evolution in imaginary time of the completely mixed state , an evolution that can also be performed in an efficient way by means of a trotter decomposition of the time evolution operator . using this numerical technique",
    "we can extend the calculation of the correlation functions up to @xmath114 , the computational limit being the construction of the state @xmath102 from the corresponding correlators as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "the local inverse temperature @xmath78 of a reduced subsystem of @xmath2 spins as a function of the global inverse temperature @xmath37 of the system ( the magnetic field is set to @xmath115 ; the matrices size for the mps algorithm is set to @xmath116 ) . from bottom to top we set @xmath117 .",
    "the dashed - dotted line shows @xmath118 for reference .",
    "we see that for larger blocks the local temperature gets closer to the global one .",
    "the actual region in which the temperature is intensive does not seem to be affected by the size of the block ( @xmath119).,width=302 ]     we plot the local inverse temperature @xmath78 reached by the reduced subsystem of @xmath2 spins as a function of the magnetic field @xmath18 ( the global inverse temperature is set to @xmath120 ) . from bottom to top the size of the block increases ( @xmath117).,width=302 ]    we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] the effective local temperature , @xmath78 , as a function of global one , @xmath37 , for reduced systems of size @xmath121 .",
    "the first feature that one may note is that the local optimized temperature tends to get closer to the global one as the block size increases .",
    "this is in agreement with the trivial fact that for large block size the local and global temperature coincide , as the block itself coincides with the whole system .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , as the block size increases the interaction between the latter and the rest of the system becomes less relevant .",
    "thus , the block will be in a thermal state with high probability , as a consequence of the results exposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . for each curve depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we checked explicitly the fidelity between a thermal state at temperature @xmath78 and the actual reduced state .",
    "we obtained that , all along these curves , the fidelity is very close to one , confirming that the results in refs .",
    "@xcite can be applied to the finite systems considered here . in turn , this points to the fact that the systems are already near to the thermodynamic limit , at least for what concerns the properties of their reduced states .",
    "however , the fact that the blocks are thermal does not mean that the temperature is intensive .",
    "as said , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows that the local temperature get closer to the global one for larger blocks , nevertheless the actual region in which the temperature is intensive does not seem to be much affected by the size of the blocks .",
    "this suggests that the quantum fidelity analysis reveals fine features of the systems that can not be understood by considerations regarding only the energy balance between the various parts of the system .",
    "in particular , as mentioned above , correlations should be considered in order to clarify such a behavior .",
    "we also notice that for each value of @xmath2 a different saturation value of @xmath78 is obtained .",
    "the latter corresponds to the effective temperature of the reduced states when the whole system is at zero @xmath1 .",
    "thus for the ground states of the considered systems , the temperature is clearly not intensive , as expected . on the other hand , for high enough temperature",
    ", we can identify again a classical regime  _ i.e. _ , a regime in which the temperature is intensive . in general , outside this classical region we observe that the local temperature is sensibly higher than the global one .    before concluding this section",
    "let us consider the influence of the zero-@xmath1 properties of the system at small temperatures .",
    "as seen in the previous section ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4.eps ] ) , we expect that at small temperatures the features of the system ground state can be revealed by an analysis of the local temperature as a function of the local field @xmath18 .",
    "the results for @xmath122 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . in accordance with the results reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , as the block size increases the local temperature gets closer to the global ones for any value of @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , notice that , as the block size increases , the minimum of @xmath78 ( that identifies when the temperature deviates mostly from an intensive behavior ) get closer to @xmath66 .",
    "this behavior around the critical value of the field @xmath123 suggests that zero-@xmath1 properties of the system ground state have an important influence on the thermal state of the block .",
    "with the study of many - body systems using thermodynamic quantities , one may obtain global properties of a system by measurements performed only on a local ( reduced ) part of it .",
    "however , depending on the conditions of the physical system under consideration , some of the fundamental assumptions of statistical equilibrium may fail and a valid thermodynamical description can not be possible .",
    "we have identified this situation in spin chains at low temperatures , where the reduced states are not thermal states at the same temperature as the global system . in particular , we have seen that the temperature ceases to be an intensive magnitude in dependence of the global temperature itself , a feature without classical analogue .",
    "this result is in accordance with the findings reported in ref .",
    "notice , however , that here we made no assumption on the correlations between the blocks in which the global system may be decomposed .",
    "in fact , we focused only on the reduced local state of the system .",
    "our approach is motivated by an operational viewpoint , since an actual measure performed on a local part of a system gives no information about correlations with other parts of it .",
    "remarkably , we have seen that an effective thermodynamical description of the reduced states is often still possible , despite the temperature may not be an intensive magnitude . in particular , the resulting reduced states can be described with high accuracy as thermal states at an optimized temperature .",
    "interestingly , this is valid _",
    "i ) _ without any additional assumption on the interactions , and _",
    "ii ) _ even if we considered blocks of particularly small size ( _ i.e. _ , composed of @xmath30 to @xmath124 spins ) .",
    "this local temperature becomes of course equal to the global one in the regime of high temperatures , where we recover the classical behavior .",
    "however , by lowering the temperature of the global system , the local temperature saturates at some point .",
    "in other words , depending on the system parameters , the local temperature may be different from zero even when the global system is in the ground state .",
    "the dependence of the local temperature on the size of the blocks has been studied too .",
    "as one may expect , the local temperature get closer to the global one for larger blocks .",
    "we pointed out that the departure from the classical behavior is more pronounced at low temperatures and for intermediate values of the local magnetic field , around the zero-@xmath1 critical point ( this is true concerning both the intensive behavior of temperature and the definition of a local temperature , as can be seen in figs .  [",
    "fig : bigfig ] , [ fig : sdistfid ] , and [ fig : fig6 ] ) . notice that this is the region of parameters where quantum correlations are expected to be stronger .",
    "for example , at zero temperature the pair - wise entanglement between two spins shows its higher values in this region @xcite , as well as the entanglement between a block of spins and the rest @xcite .",
    "though the existence of a finite block entropy may suggest that entanglement plays a crucial role in all these results , preliminary studies indicate that the relation between quantum correlations and the definition of a local temperature is nontrivial .",
    "thus it will be a subject of further studies the way in which quantum and classical correlations lead to the bahaviours identified here .",
    "let us mention here that we have analyzed also other hamiltonian systems . in this paper",
    "we have shown a study of the transverse ising model , but the extension to a generic xy interaction leads to similar results and conclusions . applying the mps techniques we can extend the analysis to spin models with arbitrary interaction , such as spin chains with heisenberg interaction .",
    "furthermore , we analyzed chains consisting of harmonic oscillators with quadratic interaction ( harmonic chains ) .",
    "in all these cases , the obtained results were qualitatively very similar to those shown here .    in order to assess the canonical character of the reduced states we employed the quantum fidelity , a quantity extensively used in quantum information science .",
    "we have seen that the fidelity is particularly suitable when studying the limits of applicability of the concept of intensive temperature . in particular , harnessing the sensitivity of quantum fidelity , we have observed how the low temperature features of the systems influence our results .",
    "this suggests that the quantum fidelity analysis reveals fine features of the systems that can not be understood by considerations regarding only the energy balance between the various parts of the system .",
    "in particular , as said , future investigations should consider the role of correlations in order to clarify such a behavior .",
