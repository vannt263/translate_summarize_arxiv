    "determinations of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) @xcite matrix elements provide important checks on the consistency of the standard model and ways to search for new physics .",
    "the possibility of observing direct cp violation in @xmath12 decays was first discussed by i. bigi and a. sanda @xcite .",
    "since then , various methods using cp violation in @xmath12 decays have been proposed @xcite to measure the unitarity triangle angle @xmath0 .",
    "these methods are based on two key observations : neutral @xmath13 and @xmath4 mesons can decay to a common final state , and the decay @xmath14 can produce neutral @xmath1 mesons of both flavors via @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ diags]a ) and @xmath16 ( fig .  [ diags]b ) transitions , with a relative phase @xmath17 between the two interfering amplitudes that is the sum , @xmath18 , of strong and weak interaction phases . for the charge conjugate mode , the relative phase is @xmath19 , so both phases can be extracted from measurements of such charge conjugate @xmath20 decay modes",
    ". however , the use of branching fractions alone requires additional information to obtain @xmath0 .",
    "this is provided either by determining the branching fractions of decays to flavour eigenstates ( glw method @xcite ) or by using different neutral @xmath1 final states ( ads method @xcite ) .",
    "a dalitz plot analysis of a three - body final state of the @xmath1 meson allows one to obtain all the information required for determination of @xmath0 in a single decay mode .",
    "the use of a dalitz plot analysis for the extraction of @xmath0 was first discussed by d. atwood , i. dunietz and a. soni in application to the ads method @xcite .",
    "this technique uses the interference of cabibbo - favored @xmath21 and doubly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath22 decays .",
    "however , the small rate for the doubly cabibbo - suppressed decay limits the experimental applicability of this technique .",
    "recently , three body final states common to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , such as @xmath9 @xcite , were suggested as being more promising , since both interfering amplitudes are cabibbo - favored in this case .",
    "this technique appears to have a higher statistical precision than methods based on branching fraction measurements .",
    "the statistical accuracy of the @xmath0 extraction can be improved by adding the excited states of @xmath1 and @xmath23 to the analysis @xcite .    in the wolfenstein parameterization of the ckm matrix elements ,",
    "the amplitudes of the two diagrams that contribute to the decay @xmath24 are given by @xmath25 ( for the @xmath26 final state ) and @xmath27 ( for @xmath28 ) .",
    "the annihilation diagram also contributes to @xmath29 , but , since the weak coefficients are the same , this effectively leads to a redefinition of the strong phase .",
    "the two amplitudes @xmath30 and @xmath29 interfere as the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons decay into the same final state @xmath31 ; we denote the admixed state as @xmath32 .",
    "assuming no @xmath33 asymmetry in neutral @xmath1 decays , the amplitude of the @xmath34 decay can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the squared invariant masses of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 combinations , respectively , and @xmath40 is the complex amplitude for the decay @xmath41 .",
    "the absolute value of the ratio between the two interfering amplitudes , @xmath42 , is given by the ratio @xmath43 and the color suppression factor .",
    "the latter can be roughly estimated from the ratio of the color suppressed @xmath44 @xcite and color allowed @xmath45 decays @xcite : @xmath46 . the amplitude ratio is therefore expected to be the product of these two factors , _ i.  e. _ @xmath47 . however , other estimations of @xmath42 exist , predicting the values as large as 0.2 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding amplitude for the charge conjugate @xmath48 decay is @xmath49 once the functional form of @xmath50 is fixed by a model for @xmath41 , the @xmath32 dalitz distributions for @xmath34 and @xmath48 decays can be fitted simultaneously using the above expressions for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with @xmath42 , @xmath0 , and @xmath53 as free parameters .",
    "there are certain advantages of this technique : it is directly sensitive to the value of @xmath0 and does not require additional assumptions on the values of @xmath42 and @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath42 obtained in the fit can be useful for other @xmath0 measurements .",
    "reference @xcite suggests a model - independent way for determining @xmath0 via a binned dalitz plot analysis .",
    "however , the application of this procedure would result in large statistical errors with our present data sample .",
    "instead , we use a model - dependent approach based on an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the @xmath54  dalitz plot distributions corresponding to @xmath34 and @xmath48 data samples , thus making optimal use of our small number of signal events .",
    "the model of @xmath41  decay in our approach is determined from a large sample of flavor - tagged @xmath41  decays produced in continuum @xmath55 annihilation .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that only the absolute value of the @xmath3 decay amplitude @xmath50 can be determined directly ; the complex form of @xmath50 has to be based on model assumptions ; these lead to potential model - dependent uncertainties in the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "note , however , that the model uncertainties can be controlled in the future using data from @xmath56-charm factories .",
    "@xmath33 tagged neutral @xmath1 mesons can be produced in the decay of the @xmath57 resonance , and these can be used to obtain information about the complex phase of the amplitude @xmath50 , which is precisely the information required for a model - independent measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "the method used here has two possible two - fold ambiguities in the determination of the pair of parameters @xmath58 .",
    "the first one is a shift @xmath59 .",
    "the measured phases @xmath60 and @xmath19 do not change under this transformation .",
    "another ambiguity is the inversion of sign @xmath61 with the simultaneous complex conjugation of the @xmath4 decay amplitude @xmath50 .",
    "this transformation does not change the observables , which are the squared absolute values of the amplitudes . however , if the @xmath4 decay amplitude is approximated by a set of two - body amplitudes , the breit - wigner dependence fixes the sign of the imaginary part of the @xmath4 decay amplitude ( the complex conjugate breit - wigner amplitude does not satisfy the causality requirement ) , and the second ambiguity is thus resolved .    in a preliminary version of this analysis @xcite , we used only the @xmath62   mode to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "the current measurement is based on two modes , @xmath62  and @xmath63  ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the statistical error evaluation is also improved compared to the previous measurement .",
    "we use a 140 fb@xmath5 data sample collected by the belle detector .",
    "the decays @xmath6  and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are selected for the determination of @xmath0 ; the decays @xmath65 , @xmath66  with @xmath8 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 serve as control samples .",
