    "liquid - liquid transition ( llt ) of a first - order kind in a stable liquid state was first unambiguously observed in phosphorus @xcite and since then it has been systematically searched for in various stable and undercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "llt is an interesting thermodynamic phenomenon , which might exhibit parallelism with the structural evolution in solid state ( crystal - crystal or amorphous - amorphous transition ) as far as short - range order of liquids and solids can in certain cases be associated .",
    "transformations in liquids may be induced by changing pressure ( transition between high - density liquid and low - density liquids ) or by changing temperature in case of transitions between high - temperature liquid ( htl ) and low - temperature liquid ( ltl ) .",
    "llt is more or less sharply exhibited in stable state of several simplest systems like p @xcite , ce @xcite , s @xcite , se @xcite , te @xcite and n @xcite and is also predicted in h @xcite , c @xcite or co@xmath0 @xcite as well as in numerous liquid metals @xcite and other composite systems . in some other materials , rather sharp changes",
    "were predicted to occur in their supercooled regimes , including water @xcite and silicon @xcite .",
    "additionally , many liquids undergo gradual changes of their structure , which are usually not considered as genuine phase transitions .",
    "an example of this case is the well - known @xmath1-transition in sulfur .",
    "sulfur s structure belongs to the most complicated of all elements with numerous cyclic and chain - like molecular conformations @xcite and a large number of solid allotropes , some with very complex structure @xcite .",
    "the ambient - conditions stable form of sulfur is insulating @xmath2 phase s - i ( @xmath3-s ) with 16 ring - shaped s@xmath4 molecules ( 128 atoms ) arranged in orthorhombic unit cell .",
    "other stable molecular phases include orientationally disordered monoclinic @xmath5-s and @xmath6-s made of s@xmath4 units and phase s - vi composed of molecules s@xmath7 . on rising pressure , s - i polymerizes into semiconducting chain phases - trigonal s - ii @xcite and tetragonal s - iii @xcite , which are composed of infinite parallel helical chains with different geometry .",
    "further compression leads to extended - network phases - incommensurately modulated @xmath8 phase s - iv @xcite and s - v with @xmath5-po structure @xcite , which are both metallic @xcite and superconducting @xcite .",
    "other structures of s were predicted from computer simulations - @xmath9-s @xcite , monoclinic - s with two different conformations of s@xmath4 molecules @xcite , chain forms similar to s - ii and s - iii @xcite or higher - pressure superconducting @xmath10 and @xmath11 structures @xcite . besides the crystalline regime",
    ", sulfur also undergoes pressure - induced amorphization @xcite and the possibility of amorphous - amorphous transition ( polymorphism in glassy state ) @xcite has also been proposed .",
    "sulfur at ambient pressure melts around 115@xmath12c @xcite and then undergoes a transformation from predominantly molecular liquid into a polymeric state at around @xmath13=159@xmath12c , which is accompanied by sharp changes in density , heat capacity and viscosity @xcite .",
    "this is the well - known @xmath1-transition , in which changes in sulfur structure proceed continuously with a wide coexistence region of molecular and polymeric units .",
    "it is therefore usually understood as a kinetically - controlled equilibrium reaction between small cyclic and long polymeric molecules in a model developed by tobolsky and eisenberg @xcite , or as a second - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "the process of temperature or photo - induced ring - opening polymerization in s@xmath4 rings was studied theoretically by classical and _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite and monte carlo @xcite simulations .",
    "though the @xmath1-transition in s has been known for over a century , it still attracts a lot of attention and was recently studied by several experimental techniques including neutron diffraction @xcite , raman spectroscopy @xcite , inelastic x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and acoustic dynamics @xcite or infrared photon correlation spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "for an equally long time , another transformation in liquid sulfur ( @xmath14-s ) has been indicated by the change in the color of the heated melt , which turns from deep - yellow at @xmath15 , through dark - orange and dark - red to dark - brown - red when approaching the boiling point ( 445 @xmath12c ) . by this point ,",
    "sulfur melt becomes highly reactive , which was attributed to the presence of various short molecules with free radicals at chain endings responsible for melt color and reactivity @xcite .",
    "this also coincides with the fact that short molecules with length 2 - 8 are constituents of sulfur vapor , which has in fact the same color as hot @xmath14-s in the vicinity of the boiling point @xcite .",
    "different colors on jupiter s moon io - ranging from yellow to dark - brown are probably also caused by these short molecules on io s surface @xcite .",
    "this structural transformation thus can be characterized as a progressive breaking of long chains into short chain - like fragments and the transformation sequence in @xmath14-s at ambient pressure then proceeds from s@xmath4-molecular to long - polymeric and finally to short - polymeric state .",
    "this liquid state evolution is directly reflected e.g. in viscosity , which has minimum below @xmath15 @xcite ( in molecular liquid ) , then rises sharply above 159 @xmath12c ( with the onset of polymerization ) reaching maximum around 180 @xmath12c @xcite ( when the average chain length is maximal ) and then again gradually decreases @xcite ( as short and more mobile molecules emerge ) . at viscosity / chain - length maximum ,",
    "other physical properties like density and electrical conductivity acquire minimal values @xcite .",
    "average length of the polymeric units in @xmath14-s was first directly measured by electron spin resonance by gardner and fraenkel and it was found to be of order @xmath16 at 171@xmath12c @xcite and then decreasing with temperature .",
    "theoretical models @xcite and computer simulations @xcite also qualitatively reproduce this temperature - induced chain shortening with longest chains near @xmath13 .",
    "recently , liu _",
    "@xcite reported observation of chain - breakage phenomenon - a rather sharp structural change in heated @xmath14-s at 6 gpa and 1000 - 1100 k between forms containing very long ( @xmath17600 at 1000 k ) and short ( @xmath1719 at 1100 k ) chains .",
    "we will refer to these two forms of @xmath14-s as ltl and htl , respectively .",
    "this experiment was the first direct structural study of heated @xmath14-s under high pressure , which apparently exhibits an abrupt decrease in average chain length in contrast to continuous ambient - pressure evolution @xcite .",
    "this process also seems to be related to earlier experiments of brazhkin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who reported a nonmetal - metal transition eventually consistent with chain breakage @xcite .",
    "however , in brazhkin s study , one additional transition in nonmetallic state of @xmath14-s was indicated .",
    "very recently , zhao and mu @xcite performed _ ab initio _",
    "md simulations and reported two successive chain breakages in accordance with all experimental data .    in this paper , we report results of our _ ab initio _ md study of @xmath14-s at 10 gpa that include fragmentation of s@xmath4 molecules into short chains on heating and polymerization of these fragments into long chains upon subsequent cooling , in accordance with ref . @xcite . also , we performed simulations along 1085 k isotherm to compare our results with recent simulations @xcite .",
    "we conclude that there is only one chain - breakage phenomenon in sulfur at investigated conditions - between long / infinite chains and very short chains of only a few atoms .",
    "our results can be directly associated with the experimentally observed chain - breakage phenomenon @xcite and semiconductor - metal ( sc - m ) transition @xcite . on the other side",
    ", we did not confirm transition in semiconducting state of @xmath14-s @xcite , which was associated with one additional chain breakage @xcite .",
    "we provide a structural description of the chain - breakage process and discuss several structural and physical properties in sulfur htl and ltl phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after describing the methods and simulation protocol",
    ", we turn to results , which include :    \\(i ) short and medium - range order structural characteristics of chains - coordination number and average lengths , cross - linking and angular and dihedral angle distributions    \\(ii ) physical properties - self - diffusion coefficient , electronic transition and configurational entropy    \\(iii ) comparison of htl - ltl transformation in @xmath14-s to similar phenomena occurring in liquid se and te    throughout the text , we compare our results to experiments and simulations already performed , whenever possible .",
    "finally , some open questions like possibility of another transition in @xmath14-s and existence of critical point(s ) , in connection to much older studies , are discussed .",
    "all _ ab initio _",
    "md simulations were performed with density functional theory ( dft ) based vasp 5.3 code @xcite employing projector augmented - wave pseudopotential ( with six valence electrons for s ) and perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) parametrization of the exchange - correlation functional . to simulate _ npt _",
    "ensemble , we used vasp 5 s implemented parrinello - rahman barostat @xcite running with langevin stochastic thermostat .",
    "accurate description of the investigated system within dft would include use of full spin - polarized calculations @xcite , since high - temperature liquid s and se were experimentally found to be paramagnetic at low pressures .",
    "this follows from the fact that electron - spin resonance of @xmath14-s @xcite and @xmath18se nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite were in fact used to track down the concentration of unpaired electron states - free radicals that are localized at chain endings @xcite and thus are directly related to average lengths of chain .",
    "such estimated lengths in @xmath14-s @xcite and @xmath14-se @xcite decrease with temperature as bonds break and paramagnetic susceptibility increases . however , warren and dupree @xcite revealed that this effect is particularly demonstrated only at low pressure , where spin - density centers remain well - separated , like in @xmath14-se near zero pressure or in se vapor @xcite . under application of only a few bars ,",
    "magnetic moments delocalize , changing from strong curie to weaker pauli paramagnetism , and induce ( full ) metallization @xcite .",
    "this observation in @xmath14-se @xcite agrees with our testings in s , where we have found that spin - polarization effects are severely suppressed under pressure , as far as difference in total energy between spin - unpolarized and paramagnetic short - chain phase ( modeled by disordered local moments ) was found to be negligible at 10 gpa compared to ( also rather mild ) @xmath1710 mev.at@xmath19 at 0 gpa .",
    "this is also in agreement with testing performed by kresse _",
    "@xcite who obtained very similar energy differences for @xmath14-se at 10 bar and suggested that only a small number of chain endings probably represents paramagnetic centers , concluding that spin - calculations will not have significant influence on structure and forces in @xmath14-se @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , shimojo _ et al .",
    "_ also investigated spin effects on supercritical fluid se , in which short chains ( mostly se@xmath0 ) are fairly distant from each other .",
    "they found that spin - polarization is pronounced , but at very low densities ( @xmath201 g.@xmath21 ) , far from liquid and even more far from compressed - liquid state conditions .",
    "based on these results , we performed non spin - polarized calculations gaining factor of two in speed .",
    "we started md simulations from s@xmath4 molecular structure taking @xmath22 supercell of s - i containing 512 atoms - a fairly large system needed to adequately describe disordered liquid state within periodic boundary conditions . since the chain breakage @xcite and sc - m transition in s @xcite were found to be mostly temperature - driven , we performed simulations along 10 gpa isobar between 700 and 2000 k to compare our results with experiments and also along 1085 k isotherm at 2 - 12 gpa to make comparison with recent md results @xcite .",
    "total simulation time of our study exceeds 400 ps , which is a run long enough to accumulate statistics that together with the size of the system maintains reliable results .",
    "the sample was initially structurally optimized to 10 gpa and then heated to 1000 k in constant pressure - temperature ensemble . after rising the temperature to 2000",
    "k the system melted and the resulting structure of @xmath14-s consisted of very short chain fragments . from this point , we gradually lowered the temperature to 1500 , 1300 , 1200 , 1100 , 1000 , 900 , 800 and finally to 700 k , where the liquid contained very long and also infinite ( within periodic supercell ) chains .",
    "we hence observed chain polymerization upon cooling , which represents a reverse reaction to the experimentally recognized chain breakage induced by heating , and associate findings of our simulations with the reported htl and ltl forms of @xmath14-s @xcite .",
    "snapshot of the simulated htl phase at 1100 k and ltl phase at 800 k is shown on fig .",
    "[ htl - ltl ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .    in the simulated system , three types of sulfur atoms were present - single - coordinated ( @xmath23 ) representing chain edges , two - coordinated ( @xmath24 ) forming insides of the chains and three - coordinated ( @xmath25 ) corresponding to chain cross - links .",
    "these atoms together formed two types of chains - simple ( isolated ) , defined as series of @xmath24 sulfur atoms terminated by @xmath23-s at both ends , and branched , consisting of @xmath24-s inside atoms and ended with one @xmath23-s and one @xmath25-s atom .",
    "the @xmath25-s atoms give rise to branched chains , which were in both htl and ltl form present along simple chains in a relevant number .",
    "some closed loops also occasionally emerged , but in negligible proportion compared to chains .",
    "cc +   +      the process of polymerization induced by cooling down the reactive htl sulfur below 1100 k is reflected in temperature dependence of individual s atoms coordinations depicted on fig .",

    "[ coor - nc - length ] ( c ) .",
    "as we can see from the graph , at all temperatures the most common were @xmath24 sulfur atoms ( insides ) followed by @xmath23-s ( edges ) and some ( non - negligible ) @xmath25-s ( cross - links ) .",
    "the abundance of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25-s shows that along gradual quenching of the system from 2000 to 700 k , the @xmath24-to-@xmath23 ratio rapidly increases below 1100 k , which is caused by transformation of short chains into long polymers as the amount of inside @xmath24 atoms increases on behalf of edging @xmath23-s .",
    "the number of cross - links drops from considerable 9.5% at 2000 k to a tiny amount of 0.7% at 700 k , but since there is only a small total number of chains below 900 k , the relative proportion of simple and branched chains remains relatively unchanged and close to 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ coor - nc - length ] ( c ) ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      isolated helical chains of sulfur are insulating @xcite , while s - ii and s - iii phases are semiconductors @xcite . liu _",
    "@xcite suggested that their observed chain breakage in @xmath14-s might be accompanied by sc - m transition , based on its probable correspondence to earlier brazhkin s experiments @xcite and from its similarity to the analogous transition present in liquid selenium .",
    "evolution of density of electronic states ( dos ) calculated within the pbe dft framework ( fig .  [ dos ] ) shows that at 700 k , the estimated bandgap is only 0.2 ev ( the true one can be larger due to the well - known pbe bandgap underestimation ) , while above 1000 k , sulfur melt starts to be clearly metallic .",
    "this demonstrates that the short - long chains llt in sulfur is indeed accompanied by transition between narrow - gap semiconducting ltl and metallic htl and we may associate findings of our simulations not only with the observed chain breakage @xcite , but also with the sc - m transition revealed from resistivity measurements @xcite .",
    "semiconducting character of long chains and metallicity of short chains were also confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    ". physical origin of metallization in @xmath14-se was attributed to the presence of chain endings , because electron states with eigenenergies just below the fermi level e@xmath27 - at the top of the valence band , were found to have large amplitudes around @xmath23-se atoms @xcite ( while @xmath25-se were associated with the bottom of the conduction band @xcite ) .",

[ dos ] ( inset ) .",
    "since experiments @xcite indicate that clapeyron slope @xmath28 of the discussed sulfur llt is rather low in the @xmath29 plane and the transition is dominantly temperature - induced , chain - breakage process must be expected to involve sharp changes in entropy and energy , though also volume discontinuities were reported for brazhkin s transitions @xcite ( but rather small away from triple points ) . in our simulations , upon cooling from htl to ltl state , we observed change in the second derivative of the total energy function , which is apparently related to the structural change - fig .",

    "this simple description may be rationalized and numerically estimated from the flory - huggins model @xcite , which provides a crude estimation of mixing entropy in polymeric - solvent solution . employing this model for pure polymer ( there are no isolated sulfur atoms in our system ) yields formula for configurational entropy @xmath33 per atom @xmath34 / l,\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is coordination of a model lattice (",

    "[ coor - nc - length ] ( b ) ) yields @xmath37 0.18 and 0.10 @xmath38 per atom for typical lattice coordination @xmath35 = 6 and 8 , respectively .",
    "this provides a very rough estimate of the entropy gain per particle in the high - temperature phase , which is due to the increased number of possible configurations .",
    "we emphasize again that the flory - huggins model corresponds to an incompressible fluid and therefore one can not expect a quantitative agreement in our case .    the investigated htl - ltl transformation may be generally viewed as a process , where configurational entropy is reduced as the number of bonds is increased @xcite .",
    "higher degree of polymerization , which is directly proportional to the average lengths of sulfur chains , maintains lower @xmath33 as far as within the energy landscape picture @xcite , formation of a new covalent bond ( process of htl - to - ltl polymerization ) may be attributed to the reduction of the number of accessible configurations @xcite .",
    "larger number of bonds in simple systems yields lower entropy .",
    "the phase diagram of sulfur shares much analogy with the two other group vi chalcogenes selenium and tellurium . in solid state , the same or similar phases of heavier se and te are stabilized at lower pressures compared to s @xcite , while liquid se and te exhibit very similar type of structural transformation between short and long(er ) chains .",
    "selenium melts directly from polymeric solid into semiconducting long - chain liquid and then undergoes thermal chain breaking , which also induces metallization .",
    "this process follows more or less sharply ( depending on actual conditions ) and was studied extensively in several experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite . the corresponding solid - liquid - liquid triple point in @xmath14-se was estimated at 3.6 gpa and 900 k @xcite .",
    "tellurium melts from polymeric solid right to the metallic short - chain form at ambient pressure at around 723 k and upon cooling into supercooled region , several physical properties exhibit extrema near 626 k @xcite .",
    "this was also attributed to transformation into form with longer chains and rings @xcite , probably isomorphous to long - chain @xmath14-se @xcite .",
    "these observations show a remarkable similarity in behavior of isovalent elements , where various solid and liquid phases coincide and their stability regions are progressively shifted to lower-@xmath29 conditions with increasing atomic mass .",
    "another similarity of liquid s and se , te lies in geometry of individual chains . in @xmath14-se ,",
    "all studies that included structure characterization reported adfs with peaks between 103 - 110@xmath12 @xcite , in accordance with adfs of our @xmath14-s - fig .",
    "[ dihedrals ] ( b ) . regarding dihedrals , quite broad distributions with plateaux in the range from 60@xmath12 to 120@xmath12 ( and further flattening on heating ) were obtained for @xmath14-se @xcite and are also very - well comparable to the simulated dihedral distributions of @xmath14-s in the ltl state , where our distributions are slightly sharper - fig .",

    "however , this effect may probably be attributed to shorter average length of te chains , which results in greater proportion of chain endings and cross - links with different geometry .",
    "from the results presented so far , it seems clear that the sc - m transformation in liquid sulfur observed back in 1991 by brazhkin _",
    "@xcite corresponds to the chain breakage phenomenon observed by liu _",
    "et al . _ , which we studied as a process of htl - ltl chain polymerization",
    "however , brazhkin and colleagues reported two transitions - l - l@xmath39 in nonmetallic state by means of thermobaric analysis ( tba ) and metallization l@xmath39-l@xmath40 ( at higher temperatures ) indicated by both tba and resistivity measurements @xcite .",
    "while the sc - m transition ( which we consider to be associated with l@xmath39=ltl to l@xmath40=htl transformation ) is well established and could be clearly recognized from anomalies in resistivity , l - l@xmath39 was indicated only by tracking down tba signals , from which phase transformation can be identified from a discontinuous change of the ( otherwise monotonous ) pressure - temperature dependence caused by sudden density change . since it was reported that volume changes were rather vague away from the triple points @xcite and l - l@xmath39 was not reproduced by viscosity measurements @xcite , its existence remains unconfirmed .-",
    "s at 1700 k @xcite could not possibly correspond to one additional of brazhkin s transitions , but this would contradict the association of ltl - htl chain breakage with sc - m transition , because the short - monoatomic transformation would have to occur inside the metallic region ] though zhao and mu @xcite associated l - l@xmath39 and l@xmath39-l@xmath40 transitions with two successive chain breakages , our study does not support this view .",
    "the very interesting observation is that at atmospheric pressure , transformation from long chains into short chain - like molecules in sulfur melt has been already known experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite for a very long time as a milder process of temperature - induced average chain length decrease , instead of sudden chain breakage .",
    "one can therefore speculate that there might be a critical point somewhere in the lower - pressure region of @xmath14-s that terminates the possibly first - order high - pressure llt , which is manifested in a continuous way at pressures near ambient .",

    "et al . _ , who reported that during the sc - m transition in @xmath14-s , the observed resistance jump becomes sharper with increasing pressure @xcite . on pressure decrease , both tba and resistivity anomalies were found to become smaller and finally could not be seen at all below 4 - 4.5 gpa , where neither l - l@xmath39 , nor l@xmath39-l@xmath40 could be recognized . under these conditions ,",
    "critical points can be expected to emerge , terminating the first - order transformations . in the case of @xmath14-se ,",
    "critical point was also predicted based on the same character of resistivity - drop dependence @xcite .",
    "we performed first - principles molecular dynamics simulations of high pressure - temperature liquid sulfur in order to analyze the structural transformation between long and short - chain form , which was recently reported in experiment by liu _",
    "_ @xcite and simulated by zhao and mu @xcite .",
    "the transition was observed as a breakdown of long polymers into short chain - like fragments upon heating , which we reproduced as short chains polymerization on cooling .",
    "the high - temperature form is composed of chains with average length less than @xmath175 , while at low temperatures the liquid contained long sulfur chains with average length over @xmath1760 . in both forms ,",
    "certain amount of cross - links and considerable abundance of branched chains was observed .",
    "chains in the low temperature phase acquire similar geometry as free sulfur helices and chains present in polymeric phase s - ii .",
    "existence of an intermediate state between the long and short - chain form of @xmath14-s @xcite , proposed to be related to brazhkin s l - l@xmath39 transition @xcite , was not confirmed in our study .    from the structural point of view , the htl - ltl transformation proceeded in our simulations rather gradually , but from the natural limitations of _ ab initio _ calculations represented by size and time scales , it was not possible to determine whether the observed changes possibly represent a phase transition and eventually determine its order , since this would require performing finite - size scaling .",
    "the structural transformation was accompanied by rather sharp changes of several physical properties including self - diffusion coefficient , electronic structure ( sc - m transition ) and energy , but not density .",
    "the process of chain breakage is clearly entropy - driven , where short chains with higher energy are stabilized by increased disorder of their configuration .",
    "very similar kind of transformation as we have studied in this paper is exhibited by selenium and tellurium .",
    "the transformation process between long and short - chain state of @xmath14-se is accompanied by increase of metallic character originating in states localized around chain edges and also by sharp change in diffusion coefficient .",
    "similarly , @xmath14-te undergoes structurally - induced semimetal - metal transition in undercooled state , which was also associated with change in average length of rings and chains .",
    "individual chains in these liquid systems are also similar to chains in @xmath14-s as concluded from angular and dihedral angle distributions",
    ".    some points in behavior of liquid s remain unclear and deserve further research , such as character of the proposed l - l@xmath39 transition inside the semiconducting regime @xcite or possibility of the existence of a critical point in heated sulfur melt at low pressures .",

    "<S> we performed an extensive _ ab initio _ study and confirmed the existence of one transformation separating two distinct liquid polymeric phases : one composed of short chain - like fragments and another one with very long chains . </S>",
    "<S> we have not observed additional transformations reported in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and in the recent theoretical study by zhao and mu @xcite and our findings are in agreement with the most recent experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we offer a structural description of this liquid - liquid transformation in terms of chain lengths , cross - linking and geometry and investigate several physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the transformation is accompanied by changes in configurational energy and entropy as well as in diffusion coefficient and electronic properties ( semiconductor - metal transition ) , but no density discontinuity was found . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe analogy of the investigated phenomenon to similar processes present in two other chalcogenes selenium and tellurium . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss possibility of a critical point terminating the studied transition in relation to the long - known behavior of ambient - pressure heated sulfur melt . </S>"
