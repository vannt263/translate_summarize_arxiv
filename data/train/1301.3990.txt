    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the process @xmath6 is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath7 and @xmath8 at leading order ( lo ) .",
    "when next - to - leading order ( nlo ) processes are included , there is a small forward - backward asymmetry ( fba ) , of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this non - zero and positive asymmetry means that ( anti-)top quarks are emitted preferably in the incoming ( anti-)quark direction . in 2011 , cdf @xcite and d  collaborations @xcite measured a high fba in @xmath0 production from proton - antiproton collisions . the d  asymmetry is @xmath10 and the cdf asymmetry is @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , cdf reported a mass dependent asymmetry @xcite : @xmath12    on the other hand , the charge asymmetry measured at atlas ( @xmath13 @xcite ) and cms ( @xmath14 @xcite ) agrees well with the sm predictions .",
    "there are various new physics ( np ) models to explain the fb asymmetry , many of which are in tension with the lhc charge asymmetry , like sign top production , and the @xmath0 cross section . in this paper",
    "we will consider and modify one of the light axigluon models suggested by tavares and schmaltz @xcite , which is still a viable candidate @xcite .",
    "axigluons have a long history @xcite and there has been a significant amount of work to explain the @xmath0 fba via massive color octets @xcite .    for details of the model ,",
    "see @xcite . to summarize",
    ", the model has an extra @xmath15 symmetry group , hence the gauge symmetry is @xmath16",
    ". introduced with this extra symmetry group is an extra set of up- and down- type quarks , and a scalar field @xmath17 , which acquires a vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) to break @xmath18 into the diagonal @xmath19 of the sm . through this symmetry breaking , one combination of the two @xmath15 gauge fields acquires a mass .",
    "this massive color octet is called the axigluon , and its massless counterpart is the sm gluon .",
    "similarly , there are combinations of fermions that become exotic heavy quarks and the sm light quarks , allowing the axigluon coupling to the light quarks to be a free parameter . also , there are no gauge anomalies due to cancellations from the additional quarks",
    ". gluons couple to both the sm and heavy quarks with the same strength as expected .",
    "the lepton sector is exactly the same as the sm , and will not be mentioned throughout this paper .",
    "the axigluon in this model can have mass below 450 gev .",
    "however , to be viable , it needs to be broad . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors introduce new heavy quarks and color adjoint scalars that the axigluon can decay into .",
    "these exotic quarks and scalars then decay into multi - jets which is not ruled out by lhc searches yet .",
    "note also that axigluons with mass @xmath20 and enhanced couplings to top quarks can be seen via lhc four - top searches @xcite .",
    "however this axigluon is fairly light , and it does not have enhanced top couplings .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider only flavor universal couplings of axigluons to the sm quarks .",
    "this relies on the strong assumption of an underlying global symmetry .",
    "this global symmetry is only approximate .",
    "mixing of heavy and light quarks could induce flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) .",
    "furthermore , since the mixing occurs between quarks that have the same @xmath21 charge , it does not give rise to flavor changing @xmath22 couplings .",
    "therefore we will not assume the existence of an exact global symmetry of the axigluon couplings , which allows flavor changing couplings of the axigluons .",
    "the new scalars in this model do not induce fcncs , so the axigluon couplings are the most significant possible source of new fcnc .",
    "other models that have flavor changing color - octet couplings have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "a general lagrangian with flavor violating axigluon interactions contains the following terms : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the axigluon , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are sm up- and down - type quarks respectively ( @xmath27 is the generation index ) , and @xmath28 are flavor independent couplings .",
    "color and spinor indices are suppressed for simplicity .",
    "the complex matrices @xmath29 contain off diagonal axigluon couplings of up- and down - quarks respectively .",
    "this mixing follows from flavor symmetry breaking of heavy and light quarks .",
    "these fcncs , which can occur at tree level , can have interesting effects on fcnc observables .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 1 , we investigate the contribution of light axigluons to @xmath1 and @xmath2 fbas . in section 2 ,",
    "we constrain the flavor changing axigluon couplings from neutral meson mixing data . in section 3",
    ", we investigate the contribution of the constrained flavor changing axigluon model to the following decays : @xmath3 , @xmath30 , and @xmath5 .",

    "vector and axial couplings of the axigluon are defined as : @xmath40 in eq.[ttax ] , the first term comes from the sm gluon exchange , the second term is the interference between the gluon and the axigluon channels , and the third term is the axigluon s - channel ( see fig.[tta ] ) .",
    "the fba comes from the terms that are proportional to the odd powers of @xmath41 , since @xmath41 is odd under @xmath42 .",
    "in order to accommodate the measured @xmath0 fba , the axigluon should give a large fba without affecting the @xmath0 cross - section , which is close to its sm value . a light axigluon ( @xmath43 gev ) with a large width @xmath44 ,",
    "is shown to agree with both the @xmath0 fba and the @xmath0 cross section @xcite .",

    "this fba is plotted in fig.[tasym ] as a function of the @xmath0 invariant mass @xmath52 .",
    "the values for coupling constants for each axigluon mass ( 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 gev ) are taken from @xcite , where the authors performed fits to both the tevatron fba and the lhc charge asymmetry , and chose the coupling constants that would best fit both of them .",
    "forward backward asymmetry , @xmath47 vs @xmath0 invariant mass @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath47 only changes sign when @xmath53 .",
    "the values for the coupling constant @xmath54 are taken from @xcite . ]",
    "an obvious prediction of the light axigluon model is fbas for bottom and charm quarks .",
    "although these may be challenging to measure , their observation would be an important clue .",
    "the graphs for these asymmetries can be seen in fig.[basym ] and fig.[casym ] .",
    "since both @xmath55 gev and @xmath56 gev are very small compared to the predicted axigluon mass ( 100s gevs ) , the fba structure is almost the same for both quarks . as can be seen from fig.[nasym ] , the predicted fbas are quite large even for low energies , @xmath57 200 gev , so the search need[line - through]*s * not [ line - through]*to * go to high invariant masses . furthermore , the crossing at @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is expected to be clearer compared to @xmath0 production , since @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , measuring the @xmath1 fba would be a good way to find out the axigluon mass .",
    "measuring the @xmath1 fba is also suggested in @xcite .",
    "in this section we will use the data available from neutral meson mixings ( @xmath61 mixing ) to constrain the fc axigluon coupling matrices , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , in eq.[fcc ] .",
    "neutral mesons  mix \" because the flavor eigenstates ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) of the sm hamiltonian are not the actual mass eigenstates ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for light and heavy respectively ) .",
    "the mass difference between @xmath69 and @xmath70 will be one of the constraints we will use for each mixing . since these processes are fcnc processes they happen via loop diagrams in the sm , like electroweak ( ew ) box diagrams in fig.[ewbox ] .",
    "these diagrams are suppressed by cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements due to flavor changing ew interactions . however , with flavor changing axigluon couplings we have neutral meson mixing at tree level . therefore the fc couplings are constrained by the mixing data for @xmath71 and @xmath72 and @xmath73 mixing .    for the following calculations we take @xmath74 gev , which gives us the least stringent constraints .",
    "we explain the methods we use to constrain each coupling constant in the respective sections . in each section",

    "although there is no clear prediction for the isospin asymmetry in @xmath254 from the sm , one might expect it to be similarly small , almost zero @xcite .",
    "the isospin asymmetry that is measured at the lhcb is consistent with the sm for the @xmath250 , however it deviates from zero with @xmath255 significance for @xmath254 @xcite .",
    "the sm prediction might be enhanced by more precise hadronic matrix element calculations , however there might as well be np involved in these decays , like flavor changing axigluons ( fig.[isoax ] ) .",
    "decays ]    in order to compare the axigluon contribution to this isospin violating process with the sm contribution , we assume that the ew penguin diagram in fig.[isosm ] is as important as any other isospin violating diagram in the sm , if not the most important one .",
    "therefore , instead of performing comprehensive calculations of the sm contributions , we only compare the two diagrams that are shown in fig.[iso ] .",
    "furthermore , we only consider the parts of these diagrams that are responsible for @xmath256 decay , since the emission of the final muons are the same in both cases .",

    "the light axigluon model is an experimentally allowed modification of the sm and a viable explanation of the cdf @xmath0 forward - backward asymmetry . in this paper",
    "we used the axigluon model suggested in @xcite to predict @xmath1 and @xmath2 forward - backward asymmetries .",
    "they are expected to be large and depend on the invariant mass of the quark pair .",
    "this mass dependence is a useful tool to investigate the mass of the axigluon .",
    "we also modified this flavor conserving axigluon model to include flavor violating couplings between the axigluon and the sm quarks .",
    "these couplings are constrained by neutral meson mixings , and the upper bounds on their magnitudes are in the range @xmath261 . after taking the upper bounds for the couplings",
    ", we checked their effects on the rare decay @xmath3 , the cp violation in @xmath30 , and the isospin violation in @xmath5 .",
    "we found that the fc axigluon has virtually no effect on the decay @xmath3 , since this process still occurs via loop diagrams .",
    "this result agrees with the last measurements of the branching ratio of this decay @xcite . in the case of the isospin violation in @xmath5 ,",
    "fc axigluon effects seem to be at most the same order as the sm ones even though the axigluon contribution is at tree level .",
    "the most interesting effect of the fc axigluon is on cp violation in @xmath30 decays . for this cp violating asymmetry ,",
    "the upper bound on the axigluon contribution is at least 10 times larger than the @xmath235 sm prediction .",
    "we conclude that adding small flavor violating effects to the light axigluon model might contribute to the cp violation in @xmath30 and to neutral meson mixings .",
