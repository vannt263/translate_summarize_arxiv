    "one of the main arguments in favour of tev scale supersymmetry ( susy ) is that it provides a natural dark matter candidate @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with conserved r - parity the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is absolutely stable . if the lsp is the lightest neutralino it is also neutral , weakly interacting and has a mass of order the electroweak scale .",
    "although general arguments suggest that such a particle should provide a good dark matter candidate @xcite , the successful regions of parameter space allowed by wmap and collider constraints are quite restricted @xcite-@xcite and it is far from clear if the neutralino can be considered a natural dark matter candidate .",
    "for example in the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) @xcite the majority of the parameter space results in a value of @xmath3 that exceeds the observed value by orders of magnitude .",
    "this is not to say that the cmssm is ruled out by the wmap measurement , just that it requires some very precise relations between parameters to fit the theory to the observed data . in the cmssm the only region in which we can fit all experimental limits within @xmath4 of the muon . throughout this paper",
    "we take the measured value of @xmath5 that provides a @xmath6 deviation from the standard model @xcite .",
    "if this discrepancy were ignored , it would be possible to access the focus point and higgs funnel regions of the cmssm parameter space .",
    "however these turn out to be finely tuned regions as we shall discuss later . ]",
    "is the @xmath7-coannihilation channel . in this region @xmath8 and the annihilation of susy particles in the early universe becomes extremely efficient .",
    "this effect is so large that the calculated value of @xmath3 drops by a factor of @xmath9 as @xmath10 approaches @xmath11 . at one point on this steep gradient of decreasing @xmath3 ,",
    "the model gives the right amount of dark matter .",
    "however to be within this strip the low energy masses must be tuned to within a few percent . from a low energy point of view",
    "the mssm contains no justification for the stau and neutralino masses to fall within this region and this has led to claims @xcite that such regions involve fine - tuning . instead arkani - hamed",
    ", delgado and giudice argue that `` well tempered neutralino '' regions in which the neutralino is not pure bino but a bino / higgsino or bino / wino mix are more plausible .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the question of how to implement neutralino dark matter in a natural way within the general mssm .",
    "specifically we explore regions of mssm parameter space with non - universal gaugino and third family scalar masses in which neutralino dark matter may be implemented naturally .",
    "dark matter with non - universal third family scalar masses has been considered in @xcite motivated by purely phenomenological consideration , or in @xcite,@xcite motivated by specific gut models .",
    "the collider phenomenology of such models has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "dark matter with non - universal gaugino masses has also been studied in @xcite-@xcite and particular high energy models with non - universal gauginos have been analysed in @xcite-@xcite,@xcite . in both cases",
    "the question of naturalness of dark matter has not been addressed .",
    "moreover no analysis of any kind has been performed which considers both types of non - universality together . here",
    "we extend the above analyses considerably by studying the question of both dark matter and electroweak fine - tuning for both non - universal third family scalar masses and non - universal gauginos , including a first study of the effect of both types of non - universality together .",
    "our main focus in this paper is on the question of whether and how naturalness may be improved by allowing such types of non - universality . in order to examine the relative naturalness of different regions we employ a dark matter fine - tuning sensitivity parameter , which we use in conjunction with the similarly defined sensitivity parameter used for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) @xcite , @xcite . employing these quantitative measures of fine - tuning",
    "we find that @xmath7-coannihilation channel in the cmssm may involve as little as 25% tuning , due to renormalisation group ( rg ) running effects .",
    "this result is in agreement with @xcite . in general",
    "moving beyond the framework of universal soft sfermion and gaugino masses in the cmssm the structure of neutralino annihilation changes drastically . by allowing third family scalar masses to vary independently @xcite , @xcite , we can access regions in which the lsp has a significant higgsino fraction as well as regions in which the dominant annihilation is through coannihilation with selectrons and smuons . with non - universal soft gaugino masses @xcite we can have a well tempered neutralino that is a bino / wino mix , although this is also very fine - tuned .",
    "however allowing non - universal gauginos also opens up a favourable region ( excluded in the cmssm ) with light sleptons that allows bino annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange .",
    "this yields a bulk region of parameter space leading to `` supernatural dark matter '' where successful dark matter can be achieved with no fine - tuning at all , leaving only the usual fine - tuning required to achieve electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the paper is set out as follows .",
    "our methodology is stated in section [ methods ] . in section [ bounds ]",
    "we survey the physical bounds that constrain our parameter space , especially @xmath12 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 , we discuss radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , and we define the dark matter and ewsb sensitivity parameters that provide a measure of fine - tuning . in section [ cmssm ] , to set the scene , we consider the coannihilation region in the cmssm , which provides us with a useful reference point against which the subsequent non - universal cases may be compared . in section [ scalar ]",
    "we allow the third family soft sfermion mass squared to vary independently . in section [ gauge ]",
    "we consider neutralino dark matter with non - universal gaugino masses , but with a universal soft scalar mass . in section [ scalargauge ]",
    "we consider _ both _ the effects of including an independent third family sfermion mass squared _ and _ non - universal soft gaugino masses .",
    "section [ conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "as the inputs for models such as the cmssm are defined at @xmath13 we need to use the rges to produce a mass spectrum at the electroweak breaking scale .",
    "to do this we use softsusy v.1.9.1@xcite .",
    "once we have generated the low energy spectrum for a point we pass it to micromegas v.1.3.6@xcite to calculate @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "we reject points that do not provide rewsb , that violate particle search limits from lep2 , points that produce a tachyon and any points that produce an lsp that is not the neutralino . in the remaining parameter space we plot",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath4 bounds of @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath12 . throughout",
    "we take the top mass to be @xmath15 .",
    "the variation of @xmath12 from the value predicted by the standard model is highly sensitive to susy contributions . to date",
    "no variation from the standard model has been detected .",
    "the present experimental measurement comes from belle @xcite , cleo @xcite and aleph @xcite .",
    "we follow the analysis of @xcite and take the value to be : @xmath16 the 1-loop susy processes involve loops with a charged higgs and a top quark and loops with a chargino and a squark . though the full 1-loop calculation is complicated , here we only mention that we expect contributions to be enhanced whenever the intermediate particles are light .",
    "there is also an enhancement for large @xmath17 .    within micromegas , all 1-loop effects",
    "are included and some 2-loop contributions .",
    "there is a detailed discussion of their implementation in @xcite .",
    "we do not include theoretical errors in our analysis as they are hard to estimate at this stage .",
    "present measurements of the value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath19 deviate from the theoretical calculation of the sm value .",
    "however questions remain around the exact form of the standard model calculation , specifically whether we should use @xmath20 or @xmath21 data in the analysis of the hadronic vacuum polarisation . at ichep 04@xcite",
    "there was general agreement that the @xmath20 data .",
    "here we take the result obtained by using the @xmath21 data and consider its implications for a susy theory . with the present experimental value from @xcite and the theoretical calculation of the sm value from @xcite",
    "there is a discrepancy : @xmath22 this amounts to a @xmath6 deviation from the standard model .",
    "results from other groups , being more consistent with the @xmath20 data .",
    "however very recently an error was reported in their analysis , and now the most recent result from snd is completely consistent with the @xmath21 results from other groups @xcite .",
    "this effectively will serve to increase the discrepancy of the muon @xmath18 with the standard model beyond @xmath6 , but since the new analysis has not yet been performed here we shall continue to conservatively assume the @xmath6 deviation . ]",
    "the susy contributions to @xmath19 come from penguin diagrams of two types .",
    "one is mediated by a chargino and a muon sneutrino , the other is mediated by a neutralino and a smuon . for a detailed discussion of these contributions , see @xcite . for our purposes",
    "it is enough to note that there will be enhancements to the susy contribution whenever smuons , mu - sneutrinos , charginos and neutralinos become light .",
    "evidence from the cmb and rotation curves of galaxies both point to a large amount of cold non - baryonic dark matter in the universe .",
    "the present measurements@xcite place the dark matter density at : @xmath23 due to r - parity , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable .",
    "if it is also electrically neutral , weakly interacting and massive it is a prime candidate for dark matter . in the majority of cases ,",
    "just such a candidate exists in the neutralino .",
    "this is a mixture of the superpartners to u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauge bosons of the standard model and the superpartners to the neutral higgs bosons : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the relevant components of the matrix that diagonalises the low energy neutralino mass matrix .",
    "this leads to three limiting cases :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the `` maximally tempered '' neutralino at point sg3 exhibits dramatically lower fine - tuning than either the bino / wino ( g4 ) or bino / higgsino ( s5 ) regions . by allowing the neutralino to be maximally mixed",
    ", we decrease the degree of tuning required to satisfy dark matter by an order of magnitude with respect to merely `` well - tempered '' cases .    as with the case of non - universal",
    "gaugino masses alone , or just a high third family scalar mass , we find that there are certain sweet points in parameter spaces where different annihilation channels contribute with roughly equal strength .",
    "these regions are characterised by a sharp drop in the fine - tuning of soft parameters required to reproduce @xmath3 . by allowing both non - universal soft gaugino masses and non - universal 3rd family scalar masses",
    "we find that not only are these sweet spots stable against further non - universalities , but also that we can access values of @xmath26 an order of magnitude smaller than in the cmssm .",
    "we have explored regions of mssm parameter space with non - universal gaugino and third family scalar masses in which neutralino dark matter may be implemented naturally . in order to examine the relative naturalness of different regions we employed a dark matter fine - tuning sensitivity parameter , which we use in conjunction with the similarly defined sensitivity parameter used for ewsb . employing these quantitative measures of fine - tuning we find that @xmath7-coannihilation channel in the cmssm may involve as little as 25% tuning , due to renormalisation group ( rg ) running effects .    for non - universal third family scalar masses in which @xmath27 is allowed to become independently large , we find that we have access to @xmath28 , and hence a solution to the susy fcnc problem , with lower @xmath26 than in the cmssm at the expense of large susy contributions to @xmath29 . alternatively , with non - universal third family scalar masses",
    ", we can also access the well tempered higgsino / bino region which agrees with @xmath5 at @xmath30 , but this well tempered point involves @xmath31 dark matter fine tuning .",
    "we can access certain regions in which we have a number of different annihilation channels at work and these lead to lower values of dark matter fine tuning .",
    "however large @xmath27 implies a high degree of fine tuning for rewsb , as expected , so a fully natural model is not possible in this case .    with non -",
    "universal gauginos the bulk region involving bino annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange can be accessed , since low @xmath32 is possible leading to light sleptons .",
    "this allows supernatural dark matter ( for example at points g1 , g2 ) with minimal ewsb fine tuning , depending on how low @xmath33 is taken consistently with the lep higgs bound .",
    "low @xmath34 and @xmath32 also allow us to fit @xmath5 at @xmath30 .",
    "alternatively , with non - universal gauginos , the well tempered bino / wino neutralino scenario is also possible , but again requires @xmath31 fine tuning as in the case of the well tempered bino / higgsino .",
    "however combinations of annihilation channels on the edge of such regions such as point g3 lead to lower fine tuning . to achieve the observed value of @xmath3 through resonant annihilation such as at point g5 through a light higgs",
    "requires extremely large fine tuning .    with both non - universal third family masses and non - universal gauginos",
    ", a new feature appears : the `` maximally tempered '' bino / wino / higgsino neutralino where the lsp consists of roughly equal amounts of bino , wino and higgsino ( for example point sg3 ) .",
    "although the maximally tempered neutralino has quite low fine tuning , the large value of @xmath27 inherent in this approach always means that ewsb will be very fine tuned .    in general",
    ", having non - universal third family and gaugino masses opens up new regions of mssm parameter space in which dark matter may be implemented naturally . in particular allowing non - universal",
    "gauginos opens up the bulk region that allows bino annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange , leading to `` supernatural dark matter '' corresponding to no fine - tuning at all with respect to dark matter .",
    "by contrast we find that the recently proposed `` well tempered neutralino '' regions involve substantial fine - tuning of mssm parameters in order to satisfy the dark matter constraints , although the fine tuning may be ameliorated if several annihilation channels act simultaneously .",
    "although we have identified regions of `` supernatural dark matter '' in which there is no fine tuning to achieve successful dark matter , the usual mssm fine tuning to achieve ewsb always remains .",
