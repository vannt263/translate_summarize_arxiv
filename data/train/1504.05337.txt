    "metallic single - wall carbon nanotubes ( m - swnts ) are ideal one - dimensional ( 1d ) conductors of nanometer to micrometer length . due to the confinement in the finite - length ,",
    "energy levels of electrons are quantized and the eigenfunctions show standing wave behavior .",
    "@xcite fourfold degeneracy of the discrete energy levels observed in the tunneling spectroscopy measurements has been considered as an intrinsic property of swnts reflecting the two non - equivalent , degenerate valleys at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 points in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) brillouin zone ( bz ) together with two spins degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite recent measurements with ultraclean swnts have found fine structures of the order of sub - milli - electron - volt in tunneling conductance spectra caused by spin - orbit interaction ,  @xcite which lifts the fourfold degeneracy by spin splitting in each valley .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , some experiments show degeneracy behaviors other than above , such as gate - dependent oscillation of twofold and fourfold degeneracy ,  @xcite and many of them have been owed to extrinsic effects such as impurities .    in our previous study ,",
    "@xcite we pointed out the asymmetric velocities in the same valley for the m - swnts because of the curvature of nanotube surface .",
    "that is , the left- and right - going waves in the same valley have different velocities , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the velocity of left - going ( right - going ) wave at the @xmath0 valley , and we have the relations @xmath5 and @xmath6 because of the time - reversal symmetry . at the same time , we claimed the formation of vernier - scale - like energy spectrum , in which two sets of the energy levels with a constant energy separation between the levels have a similar but not - exactly the same separation for each set , if the strong valley coupling occurs , in which each set of the wavefunction is formed from a left - going wave at one valley and a right - going wave at another valley . as the result of the quantization of the wavenumber in the axis direction , there are two different sets of equi - spaced discrete energy levels , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , like the vernier scale ,  @xcite showing two- and fourfold oscillations as observed in the experiments ,  @xcite where @xmath9 is the nanotube length . on the other hand , for the case of valley decoupling , in which each wavefunction is formed from a left- and right - going waves in the same valley , the fourfold degeneracy and its lift by the spin - orbit interaction  @xcite would be observed .",
    "thus , it is important to reveal the coupling of the two valleys as a function swnt chirality or the boundary shape for understanding the degeneracy behavior .    as is known that the particle - in - a-1d - box model can not be directly applied to the m - swnts because there are two left - going waves and two right - going waves , in general , the ratios of these traveling waves in a standing wave are determined by microscopic conditions such as the chirality and the boundary condition .",
    "previous calculations have shown the standing waves oscillating in the length scale of carbon - carbon bond for the armchair nanotubes , in which each standing wave is constructed in the condition of strong valley coupling .",
    "@xcite on the other hand for the zigzag nanotubes , the slowly oscillating standing waves for doubly degenerate levels can be constructed in the condition of valley decoupling .",
    "@xcite the swnts have been classified in terms of the boundary condition . using generalized parameters , mccann and falko classified the boundary conditions for the dirac electrons in the m - swnts .",
    "@xcite by employing microscopic analysis on the boundary modes for the honeycomb lattice , akhmerov and beenakker showed that , except for the armchair edge , zigzag - type boundary condition  @xcite , in which two valleys decouple each other in the eigenfunctions , is applicable for general boundary orientation with a so - called minimal boundary , in which the edge has minimum numbers of empty sites and dangling bonds , and these numbers are the same .",
    "@xcite above theory ,  @xcite as well as assuming the slowly varying confinement potential ,  @xcite supports the decoupling of the two valley as a typical case for the m - swnts except the armchair nanotubes .    here",
    ", we will show that the two valleys are strongly coupled in the chiral nanotubes classified into so - called metal-2 nanotubes ( see  [ sec : cuttingline ] ) ,  @xcite with certain boundaries , as well as the armchair nanotubes .",
    "the effect of the strong coupling combined with the asymmetric velocities appears as the vernier - scale - like spectrum .",
    "for the so - called metal-1 nanotubes ,  @xcite and for the metal-2 nanotubes with the minimal boundary , it will be shown the fourfold degeneracy and its small lift by the spin - orbit interaction as the result of decoupling of two valleys .",
    "in addition , it will be shown that parity splitting of the valley degeneracy overcomes the spin - orbit splitting for shorter metal-2 nanotubes with the minimal boundary .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the finite - length m - swnts in which the ends and the center have the same rotational symmetry .",
    "we will show that the degeneracy of discrete energy levels of m - swnts strongly depends on the chirality , boundary condition , length and the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we will revisit and analyse the cutting lines with the point of view of the orbital angular momentum , then will perform numerical calculation for an extended tight - binding model and analytical calculation for an effective 1d model to investigate the degeneracy and the valley coupling .",
