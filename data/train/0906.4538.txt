    "chemotaxis is the directed motion of cells in response to various chemical clues .",
    "it plays a key role in developmental biology , and more generally in self - organization of cell populations .",
    "several categories of mathematical models have been proposed to describe this organization process .",
    "depending upon the level of description required , micro- , meso- or macroscopic models can be used @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic models consist in kinetic ( scattering ) equations well - suited for describing the motion of bacteria such as _ escherichia coli _ which undergo a run and tumble process @xcite .",
    "macroscopic models consist in parabolic ( drift - diffusion ) equations and are well - suited for describing motion of large cells such as the slime mold amoebae _",
    "dictyostelium discoideum _ @xcite .",
    "we focus on the macroscopic setting in this paper .",
    "the so - called keller - segel model exhibits a very rich behaviour , emphasized by the critical mass phenomenon arising in two dimensions of space .",
    "the keller - segel system writes in a simple formulation @xcite :    [ pks ] @xmath4    here @xmath5 denotes the cell density and @xmath6 denotes the concentration of the chemical attractant .",
    "the first contribution in the right hand side of expresses the tendency of cells to diffuse under their own brownian motion whereas the second term expresses their tendency to aggregate due to the presence of the chemical . in two dimensions of space",
    "the two tendencies are evenly balanced and the global behavior of the solution depends on the total mass of the cells .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath7 blow - up occurs in finite time ( aggregation overwhelms diffusion ) and for @xmath8 solutions are global in time ( diffusion wins the competition ) @xcite .",
    "however in one dimension of space diffusion is always stronger than aggregation and blow - up never occurs for systems such @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the system in one space dimension with the cell diffusion being ruled by fractional diffusion .",
    "the usual laplacian in is therefore replaced by the fractional laplacian .",

    "an alternative representation is given by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is some normalizing factor .",
    "non - local operators , and in particular the fractional laplacian , have received a lot of attention recently @xcite . in biology",
    "the motivation comes from the fact that in many cases organisms adopt lvy - flight search strategies and therefore dispersal is better modelled by non - local operators @xcite .",
    "focusing on the one - dimensional case may seem unnatural from the biological viewpoint .",
    "however we have in mind seeking a critical mass phenomenon as it has been derived for the two - dimensional classical keller - segel model .",
    "it appears that @xmath16 is the critical fractional exponent to state such a result .",
    "therefore it makes only sense when @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "we partially answer this issue below in the latter situation .",
    "the system was first studied in @xcite where it was shown that global existence holds true for @xmath19 assuming that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we aim at providing here global existence versus blow - up results in the same spirit as for the dichotomy arising in the two - dimensional classical keller - segel system .",
    "more precisely , we are able to prove that solutions are global in time in the fair - competition case @xmath22 , if the total mass @xmath23 is assumed to be small enough . in the case",
    "@xmath1 we show that solutions may exist globally or may blow - up depending on the initial data .",
    "we exhibit explicit criteria to distinguish between these two alternatives .",

    ". then solutions are global in time and belong to any @xmath30 space for all positive time @xmath31 .    to complete the picture it is natural to look for blow - up results in the super - critical case .",
    "we shall prove in the sequel that the aggregation contribution can overcome the diffusion effect in the case @xmath1 under suitable restrictions on the initial data .",
    "however describing the behaviour for initial data having large mass in the case @xmath22 remains open ( the constant @xmath34 in theorem [ bu ] below diverges when @xmath35 )",
    ".    [ bu ] consider the system for @xmath36 in one space dimension with initial data @xmath37 .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath34 such that the condition , @xmath38 excludes global existence of regular solution : a singularity must appear in finite time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : ge ] we prove global existence , beginning with a simple but not complete argument based on @xmath39 estimates .",
    "the proof is then achieved thanks to @xmath30 estimates inspired by @xcite . in section [ sec : bu ] we prove blow - up of solutions .",
    "the paper is supplemented by numerical illustrations of the two above - mentioned phenomena .",
    "we start by stating some estimate which will be widely used throughout this section .    [",
    "prop : gns ] for any exponents @xmath25 and @xmath40 , the following gagliardo - nirenberg type inequality holds true : @xmath41    we distinguish between the cases @xmath1 and @xmath22 . in the former we use first the hlder inequality to obtain : @xmath42 where we have used the sobolev embedding : @xmath43 .    in the case",

    "proceeding as above , the exponent @xmath56 can not be chosen arbitrarily ( the constraint @xmath57 forces @xmath58 ) .",
    "however , there is a way to extend it to any @xmath59 by slightly modifying the argument : using @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 we get : @xmath62 raising this inequality to the power @xmath63 leads to the result .",
    "we complete here some existing results first derived by escudero @xcite .",
    "we use gagliardo - nirenberg type inequalities instead of the sobolev inequality used in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to study a wider range of @xmath64 s .",
    "we are concerned in this section with the global existence of the keller - segel system with fractional diffusion of cells when @xmath65 , using simple harmonic analysis estimates .",
    "this will be extended below in section [ sec : existence lp ] to any @xmath66 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to derive simply _ a priori _ estimates which guarantee global existence of solutions and to set the stage for our approach in section [ sec : existence lp ] .",
    "the constraints on the exponent @xmath64 here are an artefact of the method : in short the interpolation of @xmath3 between @xmath67 and @xmath39 yields @xmath68 .",
    "as it is now standard in such systems , we aim at deriving suitable @xmath30 norm of the cell density . due to the simple formulation of the fractional diffusion in the fourier space variable , we opt for @xmath69 .",
    "we will relax this constraint in the next section .",
    "we have the following estimation : @xmath70 we then apply the gagliardo - nirenberg inequality ( proposition [ prop : gns ] ) for @xmath71 : @xmath72 in the case @xmath73 we obtain the decay of the @xmath39 norm providing that the mass is small enough : @xmath74 it follows that @xmath75 , as soon as @xmath76 .",
    "it is also possible to conclude without assuming @xmath76 , by means of regularizing effects .",
    "in fact using interpolation between @xmath67 and @xmath77 it comes out that also implies ( when the mass is small enough ) : @xmath78 therefore @xmath79 becomes finite in zero time .",
    "we shall come back to that later .    in the case",
    "@xmath80 the gagliardo - nirenberg inequality implies that : @xmath81 as opposed to the case @xmath22 , the quantity @xmath82 is not conserved in time .",
    "therefore we have to develop an alternative strategy as in @xcite for the keller - segel in dimension @xmath83 , where the criterion for global existence involves the @xmath84-norm . here",
    "we simply use the fact that @xmath3 can be interpolated between @xmath67 and @xmath39 if @xmath85 . as a consequence",
    "we have : @xmath86 thus if the quantity @xmath87 is small enough , then @xmath88 automatically decays for every time .",
    "we will see later that this criterion can be ameliorated , as the @xmath3 ( before interpolation ) appears to be the critical space for this problem ( analogous to @xmath84 in the classical keller - segel problem ) . to derive this improved criterion",
    "we shall understand how the @xmath30 norms of the cell density evolve , using more refined tools for integration by parts .",
    "[ rem ] in the case @xmath89 , if we assume that @xmath20 and @xmath21 we can work similarly as in @xcite to obtain an a - priori estimate on @xmath90 . then the sobolev inequality gives a bound on @xmath91 .",
    "following @xcite , the one - dimensional fractional laplacian can be interpreted as a ` dirichlet to neumann problem ' on the two - dimensional half - space ( with an appropriate modification when @xmath92 ) .",
    "namely it is related to the following minimization problem . given a function @xmath93 defined for @xmath94 ( and belonging to appropriate spaces , see @xcite for details ) find a function @xmath95 defined on @xmath96 coinciding with @xmath93 on the boundary : @xmath97 , which minimizes the weighted functional , @xmath98 when @xmath22 this is nothing but the harmonic extension of @xmath99 to the upper half - space .",
