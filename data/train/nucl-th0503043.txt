    "the known meson spectrum contains three pseudoscalars [ @xmath11 , all with masses below @xmath12gev @xcite : @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ; and @xmath15 .",
    "the lightest of these , the pion [ @xmath13 ] , is much studied and well understood as qcd s goldstone mode .",
    "it is the basic degree of freedom in chiral effective theories , and a veracious explanation of its properties requires an approach to possess a valid realisation of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking .    the @xmath14 is broad , with a width of @xmath17 to @xmath18mev . in the framework of constituent - quark models",
    "it is usually interpreted as the pion s first radial excitation .",
    "namely , the @xmath14 is pictured as : an @xmath19 @xmath20 meson , where @xmath21 denotes a constituent - quark ; and the first radially excited state of the @xmath13 on a @xmath20 @xmath22 trajectory , where @xmath23 is the `` principal quantum number '' @xcite .    at first sight",
    "it might appear natural to interpret the @xmath15 as the third state on the @xmath22 trajectory .",
    "however , in comparison with @xmath14 , the @xmath15 is narrow , with a width of @xmath24mev , and has a decay pattern that may be consistent with its interpretation as a _ hybrid _",
    "meson in constituent - quark models @xcite .",
    "this picture has the constituent - quarks spins aligned to produce @xmath25 with @xmath26 obtained by coupling @xmath27 to a spin-@xmath28 excitation of the confinement potential .",
    "it is legitimate to ask for a unified theoretical understanding of these states and , indeed , the entire trajectory of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "this is a topical question ; e.g. , refs.@xcite , and it is easy to identify at least one reason why . in the context of a constituent - quark model hamiltonian a subset , if not all , of the pseudoscalar mesons form a @xmath29 @xmath22 trajectory . in this framework",
    "the support possessed at long - range by the bound state s wave function grows with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "hence the properties of radially excited states become increasingly sensitive to the manner by which confinement is expressed in the potential . as we have already noted , in this same context",
    "a definition and representation of hybrid mesons requires that explicit excitation of the confinement potential be included as an additional degree of freedom .",
    "seen from this perspective one may anticipate that the properties of all the heavier pseudoscalar mesons are likely to be sensitive to the long - range part of the interaction between light - quarks in qcd , whether they be radial excitations or hybrid mesons .",
    "this suggests that the study of their properties can provide a map of what might be called the confinement potential between light - quarks .",
    "( nb . the information obtained thereby is complementary to that gathered in studies of axial - vector mesons @xcite , which in constituent - quark models are interpreted as orbital excitations of the @xmath30- and @xmath31-mesons . )    it is not possible to accurately describe pseudoscalar mesons using a framework that fails to respect the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity .",
    "for example , chiral symmetry and its dynamical breakdown force the leptonic decay constant of every pseudoscalar meson , _ except _ the goldstone mode , to vanish in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "herein we therefore employ qcd s dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) ( modern applications are reviewed in refs.@xcite ) for which a systematic , poincar covariant and symmetry preserving treatment of quark - antiquark bound states has been established @xcite . to provide exemplars we will focus primarily on the @xmath13 and the next - lightest pseudoscalar state .",
    "nonetheless , the exact results will apply to all elements on the pseudoscalar meson trajectory .",
    "it is noteworthy that in poincar covariant quantum field theory all bound states with given quantum numbers ; e.g. , ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , are described by the same homogeneous bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "this is kindred to the statement that all interpolating fields with the same quantum numbers are on - shell equivalent , a fact which is apparent in numerical simulations of lattice - qcd ; e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "hence a given homogeneous bse yields the mass and bethe - salpeter amplitude of every bound state in the channel specified by ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .    in a confining theory a given @xmath34 trajectory will likely contain a countable infinity of bound states .",
    "the lowest mass member of the trajectory is conventionally described as the ground state .",
    "all other members may reasonably be described as excited states .",
    "the radial excitation of a state with a given @xmath34 preserves this total - momentum@xmath35parity assignment .",
    "however , it may be distinguished from the ground state by the pointwise behaviour of its bethe - salpeter amplitude , which when analysed appropriately exhibits a finite number of zeros . as in quantum mechanics",
    ", the number of zeros can be associated with a principal quantum number @xmath23 .",
    "studies of pseudoscalar mesons show that the ground state amplitude has no zeros and can therefore be associated with @xmath1 .",
    "the amplitude of the next highest mass pseudoscalar possesses one zero and is therefore identified with @xmath36 ; e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in simple models , this pattern continues @xcite .",
    "it may be that hybrid mesons , if they exist , can likewise be identified through the pointwise behaviour of their bethe - salpeter amplitudes .",
    "for example , a solution of the pseudoscalar bse , heavier than the first radial excitation , whose bethe - salpeter amplitude exhibits both : a pattern of zeros which does not match that associated with radial excitations ; and relationships between component functions in the bethe - salpeter amplitude different from those present in the lower mass solutions , would appear a reasonable hybrid candidate .    of course , bethe - salpeter amplitudes are not themselves observable and the experimental categorisation of ground , and excited and putative hybrid states proceeds via analysis of their decay patterns . notwithstanding this",
    ", the order in those decay patterns is determined in large part by the bethe - salpeter amplitudes pointwise behaviour .",
    "we therefore anticipate that a natural distinction between straightforward radial excitations and hybrids may be possible without recourse to a constituent - quark model basis .    in sec.[gapbse ] we recapitulate on aspects of the dses and truncation scheme that are relevant to our study .",
    "the abelian anomaly features in sec.[exact ] , wherein exact results are derived regarding the coupling of pseudoscalar mesons to two photons .",
    "we outline a renormalisation - group - improved model of the quark - antiquark scattering kernel in sec.[model ] .",

    "the length - scale @xmath254 measures the range of strong attraction in our model : magnifying @xmath255 increases the range of strong attraction . in sec.[sec : intro ] we argued that the properties of radial excitations should be sensitive to the nature of the interaction between light quarks at long - range .",
    "it is now apparent that this is true .",
    "moreover , decreasing @xmath191 has the effect of increasing the active range of the confining piece of the interaction in eq.([calg ] ) .",

    "that compresses the bound state , as one observes in fig.[fig : emradii ] : @xmath256 decreases rapidly with decreasing @xmath191 ( increasing @xmath255 ) .",
    "a similar result for the evolution of the mass was observed in ref.@xcite ; namely , the mass of the first excited state dropped rapidly with increasing @xmath255 . on the domain illustrated in fig.[fig : emradii ] , the mass of the ground state obtained with nonzero current - quark mass varied by only 3% while that of the first excited state changed by 14% .",
    "it is natural to expect that an increase in the strength of the confinement force should increase the magnitude of the binding energy and hence reduce the mass , and that is precisely what occurs .",
    "independent of the parameters , the ground state mass is identically zero in the chiral limit because the truncation is symmetry preserving .",
    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , which has many consequences , is another reason why properties of the ground state pseudoscalar meson do not respond rapidly to modest parameter changes . )",
    "it is natural to suppose @xmath257 ; namely , that a radial excitation is larger than the associated ground state .",
    "however , our calculations illustrate that with the ground state pseudoscalar meson s properties constrained by goldstone s theorem and its pointwise consequences , eqs.([bwti ] )  ( [ hwti ] ) , it is possible for a confining interaction to compress the excited state with the consequence that @xmath258 .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath191-dependence of @xmath259 indicates that a value of @xmath260gev may be obtained with @xmath261 @xcite .",
    "however , quantitative difficulties connected with the behaviour of the dressed - quark propagator in the complex-@xmath262 plane @xcite currently prevent us from studying the excited state directly with @xmath263 in eq.([calg ] ) .",

    "the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) yields the mass and amplitude of every bound state in a given channel specified by @xmath276 .",
    "hence it provides a practical tool for the poincar covariant study of mesons on these trajectories .    in applying the bethe - salpeter equation to a study of pseudoscalar mesons we made use of the fact that at least one nonperturbative and symmetry preserving dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) truncation scheme exists",
    "this fact supports a proof that , in the chiral limit , excited state @xmath92 mesons do not couple to the axial - vector current ; viz .",
    ", @xmath277 @xmath278 .",
    "we demonstrated that the leading - order ( rainbow - ladder ) term in the dse truncation scheme , when consistently implemented , is necessary and sufficient to express the abelian anomaly .",
    "it can therefore be used to illustrate the anomaly s observable consequences .",
    "we capitalised on this to show that even though excited state pseudoscalar mesons decouple from the axial - vector current in the chiral limit , they nevertheless couple to two photons .",
    "( nb .  the strength of this coupling is materially affected by the continuum contribution to the abelian anomaly . )",
    "hence the primakov process , as employed for example in _ primex _ at jlab @xcite , may be used as a tool for their production and study .",
    "a renormalisation - group - improved rainbow - ladder truncation is guaranteed to express the one - loop renormalisation group properties of qcd .",
    "we exploited this and thereby determined the leading power - law behaviour of the @xmath3 transition form factor .",
    "when the current - quark mass is nonzero then , for all @xmath23 , this form factor behaves as @xmath279 at deep spacelike momenta . for all but the goldstone mode this leading order contribution vanishes in the chiral limit . in that case , however , the form factor remains nonzero and the ultraviolet behaviour is @xmath280 .",
    "although only exposed starkly in the chiral limit for excited states , this subleading power - law contribution to the @xmath3 transition form factor is always present and in general its coefficient is not simply related to @xmath10 .",
    "as one might rationally expect , the properties of excited ( @xmath145 ) states are sensitive to the pointwise behaviour of what might be called the confinement potential between light - quarks .",
    "we illustrated this by laying out the evolution of the charge radii of the @xmath281 pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "as it is shielded by goldstone s theorem , the ground state s radius can be insensitive to details of the long - range part of the interaction .",
    "however , that is not true of @xmath256 , the radius of the first excited state , which is orthogonal to the vacuum .",
    "an increase in the length - scale that characterises the range of the confining potential reduces @xmath256 .",
    "this result states that increasing the confinement force compresses the excited state : indeed , it is possible to obtain @xmath282 .",
    "however , our current best estimate is @xmath283 .",
    "a detailed exploration of the properties of collections of mesons on particular @xmath34 trajectories offers the hope of exposing features of the long - range part of the interaction between light - quarks . in principle , this interaction can be quite different to that between heavy - quarks .",
    "the pseudoscalar trajectory is of particular interest because its lowest mass entry is qcd s goldstone mode .",
    "chiral current conservation places constraints on some properties of every member of this trajectory , whose study may therefore provide information about the interplay between confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",

    "<S> ' '' ''    the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity places constraints on particular properties of every pseudoscalar meson . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the chiral limit all pseudoscalar mesons , except the goldstone mode , decouple from the axial - vector current . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , all neutral pseudoscalar mesons couple to two photons . the strength of the @xmath0 coupling , where @xmath1 denotes the goldstone mode , is affected by the abelian anomaly s continuum contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is material for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 transition form factor , @xmath4 , is nonzero @xmath5 , and @xmath6 at large @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> for all pseudoscalars but the goldstone mode , this leading contribution vanishes in the chiral limit . in this instance </S>",
    "<S> the ultraviolet power - law behaviour is @xmath8 for @xmath2 , and we find numerically @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this subleading power - law behaviour is always present . in general its coefficient </S>",
    "<S> is not simply related to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of @xmath2 pseudoscalar mesons are sensitive to the pointwise behaviour of the long - range piece of the interaction between light - quarks . </S>"
