    "the pion  the lightest meson  epitomizes the bound state of two light quarks within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . employing light - front ( lf ) quantization ,",

    "then , the leading - twist - two da of the @xmath7 valence state is described by @xmath8 . in operator language , this @xmath0 da is given by the following gauge - invariant matrix element : @xmath9 q(0 )             | \\pi(p )    \\rangle|_{z^{2}=0 } =    if_\\pi p_\\mu \\int_{0}^{1 } dx e^{i x ( z\\cdot p ) }    \\varphi_{\\pi}^{(2 ) } \\left(x,\\mu^2\\right ) \\",

    "the momentum - scale dependence of the da is controlled within perturbative qcd by a renormalization - group type evolution equation due to brodsky , lepage @xcite , and efremov , radyushkin @xcite ( erbl ) .",
    "for this reason , one seeks to express the pion da in terms of the eigenfunctions of this equation , i.e. , the gegenbauer harmonics @xmath12 with the gegenbauer polynomials @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the asymptotic da and the nonperturbative content of the pion bound valence state is encoded in the expansion coefficients @xmath16 .",
    "owing to the fact that the @xmath0 da ( or any other hadron da ) is not directly measurable , one has to model it by determining the coefficients @xmath16 at a typical hadronic scale of order @xmath17  gev@xmath18 using some nonperturbative method ( see next section ) and use erbl evolution to obtain them at any scale @xmath19 .",
    "regardless of the differences among these methods , the pion das share some particular properties which will be addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pi - prop ] .",
    "in fact , the success or failure of a particular da will depend on the ability to describe existing data for various pion observables and make tangible predictions for data to come ( more in sec .",

    "our findings will be summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , where we will also draw our conclusions .",
    "the pion das used in our analysis were determined with the help of qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates ( nlc - sr for short ) @xcite .",
    "our method derives from @xcite in which the meson da @xmath20 over the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath21 was linked to the distributions @xmath22 of the virtuality of quarks and gluons in the nonperturbative vacuum of qcd .",
    "this was achieved by relating the pion and its first resonance @xmath23 to the correlator of two axial currents with nlc contributions in a sum rule : @xmath24 here the index @xmath25 runs over scalar ( s ) , vector ( v ) quark condensates , and quark - gluon condensates ( t ) , while ( g ) denotes the gluon condensate .",
    "the most important parameter is the nonlocality @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the borel parameter and @xmath28 is the average vacuum - quark virtuality , defined by @xmath29 $ ]  gev@xmath30 .",
    "this sum rule depends on the duality interval @xmath31 in the axial channel and involves the spectral density @xmath32 in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "a whole family of admissible @xmath0 das can be reconstructed @xcite from the above sum rule via the calculation of the moments @xmath33 and also in terms of an independent sum rule for the inverse moment @xmath34 : @xmath35 below , we only summarize the main features of nlc - srs , referring the reader for further details to @xcite .",

    ", we obtain in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlcsrda ] ) 6 functions @xmath22 instead of 2 numbers for @xmath38 .",
    "( ii ) the nonlocal condensates are assumed to decrease with increasing distance ( between vacuum fields ) .",
    "in fact , the _ finiteness _ of the widths of the nlcs plays a crucial role because it renders the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlcsrda ] ) less singular in @xmath39 @xcite . to be specific , the singularities at the end points @xmath40 , inevitable in the local approach , disappear .",
    "these finite widths have been estimated from the next higher terms in the expansions of the nlcs and are proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "( iii ) to estimate the integral characteristics of @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : moments ] ) , it is plausible to approximate the nlc by gaussian models which depend only on the single scale @xmath43 .",
    "this is sufficient to account for the main effect , i.e. , the finite widths of the nlcs .",
    "the complete calculation of all nlo corrections to the rhs of the sr above will be undertaken in a separate work @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the evaluation of the sr in ( [ eq : nlcsrda ] ) enables us to estimate the first 5 moments @xmath44 and , independently , the value of @xmath34 .",

    "the dse - based derivation of the pion da employs the determination of its first 50 @xmath49 moments from which the pion da is reconstructed in the form of the following gegenbauer representation : @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 is considered to be a fit parameter and is not forced to the value 3/2 , i.e. , to the conformal expansion .",
    "two different procedures to treat the gap and the bethe - salpeter kernels in incorporating the nonperturbative features of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) were used in @xcite , based on the rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation and the dcsb - improved ( db ) kernel .",

    "the other depicted das are identified appropriately in the figure .",
    "as one sees from the left panel of fig . [ fig : pi - das ] , the profiles of the pion da can vary significantly .",
    "lattice simulations , while useful , can currently provide constraints only for the second moment @xmath74 ( or equivalently the gegenbauer coefficient @xmath68 ) @xcite , while higher moments ( coefficients ) are still at large .",
    "thus , lacking experimental evidence to restrict this variation , one may appeal to other _ unbiased _ tools to explore the structure of the pion da . to this end ,",
    "one of us has recently proposed @xcite to use the kuramoto model ( see @xcite for a review ) which describes the synchronization of nonlinear oscillators in complex systems .",
    "the main features of stefanis s approach are as follows .",
    "the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath39 are considered to be the natural frequencies ( phases ) of a large number ( @xmath75 ) of phase - coupled oscillators .",
    "the interaction among these oscillators gives rise to characteristic patterns of clustering in the interval @xmath76 $ ] which in turn correspond to particular da profiles .",
    "the analysis in @xcite has revealed that at finite momentum values of @xmath19 , the @xmath39 spectrum tends to synchronize as a result of nonperturbative correlations , encoded in nonlocal condensates , and the dcsb which is responsible for the generation of quark and gluon masses within a dse - based framework . while the first effect suppresses the endpoints @xmath40 , the dse treatment yields strong enhancement of these regions .",
    "this contradicting behavior inspired in @xcite the following parametrization of the pion da @xmath77 with a mixing parameter @xmath78 .",
    "motivated by this finding , we furthered our nlc - sr - based approach and selected an admissible da @xcite that inherently combines the synchronization properties mentioned above and detailed in @xcite .",
    "the profile of this da , shown at the scale of @xmath79  gev@xmath18 as a thick red solid line on the lhs of fig .",
    "[ fig : pi - das ] , is characterized by a broad maximum along a downward concave curve that bears a strong resemblance to the dse das ( db and rl ) over a large range of @xmath39 values . however , its tails at @xmath80 and @xmath81 are suppressed , so that this da has a platykurtic ( pk ) profile , in contrast to the family of the broad , endpoint - enhanced dse das ( light - shaded yellow band bounded by dotted lines on the lhs of fig .",

    "indeed , we investigated the rate of convergence of the pion - photon tff , calculated within our scheme with the dse das , quantitatively and found that already the contribution to the tff stemming from the inclusion of the coefficient @xmath103 plays only a marginal role ( @xmath104 )  rhs of fig .",
    "[ fig : bms.3dvsdata.dse.plat ]",

    "the deviations of the high-@xmath19 babar data from `` theory '' with the bms das are larger relative to those with the dse ones .",

    "[ fig : bms.3dvsdata.dse.plat ] reveals , while the dse results ( upper band ) do not exclude an auxetic tff behavior .",
    "in contrast , the platykurtic da rules out a growth of the tff and supports a scaling behavior at higher @xmath19 .",
    "note that model ii , obtained with lcsrs in @xcite and retrofitted to the belle data in the second entry of @xcite , lies within the upper blue strip of our predictions .",
    "our nlc - sr - based pion das can be successfully used to describe other processes involving the pion da .",
    "examples are the pion elastic form factor @xcite , the diffractive di - jet production @xcite , and the meson - induced drell - yan production for the process @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "two major findings of these analyses are worth mentioning here : ( i ) using the convolution scheme developed in @xcite , it was shown in @xcite that the derived predictions with the bimodal bms das are in good agreement with the e791 di - jet events @xcite even in the central @xmath39 region where the bms da `` bunch '' has its largest uncertainties ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pi - das ] ) .",
    "( ii ) it was found in @xcite that with the bms das the angular parameters @xmath106 to describe the angular distribution of @xmath107 in the unpolarized drell - yan @xmath105 process comply best with the existing data .",
    "we have presented detailed predictions for the pion - photon tff which comprise all currently known qcd perturbative and nonperturbative contributions within a lcsr theoretical scheme . within this scheme",
    ", we used several types of pion das as nonperturbative input on account of collinear qcd factorization .",
    "we found that bms - like das , which are two - parametric bimodal distributions @xcite replicate those data which are compatible with scaling , while they disagree with the high-@xmath19 babar data which grow with the momentum .",
    "crucially , this agreement is tightly connected to the endpoint behavior of these pion das and to much lesser extent to the broadness of the da in the central region of @xmath39 . indeed , using qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates",
    ", we determined a new da which is a short - tailed platykurtic curve but leads to similar tff results as the original bms das . from the point of view of its profile , the platykurtic da has a broadness similar to the dse one , being downward concave , but has suppressed endpoint regions like the bms das , thus somewhat `` merging '' these das , as argued in @xcite . on the other hand , the predictions obtained within our framework with the endpoint - enhanced dse - based das mostly overestimate the current tff data .",
    "the distinct behavior of the presented forecasts  scaling vs. growth with @xmath19  for the pion tff can serve to select the most appropriate model da with the help of the expected belle  ii data in the near future . theoretically , it would be of great importance to explore in detail the relation of nlcs to the dse framework .",
