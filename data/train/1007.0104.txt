    "photon - photon scattering does not occur in classical electrodynamics because maxwell s equations are linear in the fields . in quantum electrodynamics ( qed )",
    ", @xmath0 elastic scattering is described in lowest order by a fermion loop with four open photon lines ( box diagram ) . at low energies ( @xmath2 ) , the corresponding cross section is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the center of mass system ( cms ) photon energy , @xmath5 is the electron mass , @xmath6 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath7 is the classical radius of the electron@xcite .",
    "this cross section is extremely small in the optical domain where high brightness sources exist  : @xmath8=7.3~10^{-66}(\\hbar\\omega[\\text{ev}])^{6}$ ] .",
    "qed is a well established theory .",
    "the derivation of @xmath9 is not in question .",
    "furthermore , the contribution of the box diagram is needed to describe the already observed delbrck scattering and the high precision measurements of the electron and muon magnetic moment .",
    "the interest here is in the search for possible non - qed new physics in low energy @xmath0 scattering .",
    "a theoretical basis for this is possibly coming from composite photon theory @xcite or the exchange of an axion @xcite .    a previous experiment using the head - on collision of two laser beams at different wavelengths has obtained a limit cross section of @xmath10 ( at 95% cl ) @xcite .",
    "here we improve this result by nine orders of magnitude by stimulating the reaction with a third beam @xcite . the qed contribution to this process",
    "is equivalent to four wave mixing in vacuum .",
    "in elastic scattering , the values of the energies @xmath11 and wave vectors @xmath12 of the incoming photons satisfy the energy - momentum conservation condition  : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where indices 1,2 denote the incoming photons , 3,4 the outgoing photons .    in simple ( ie .",
    "non stimulated ) elastic scattering , the final state is determined by two parameters ( eg . the euler angles of the decay axis in the cms ) . here",
    "we stimulate the reaction by a third beam , with a wavelength @xmath15 ; this fixes one parameter .",
    "the direction of beam # 3 must lie on the cone of allowed direction for a scattered photon at @xmath15 .",
    "this position on the cone then fixes the second parameter .",
    "the signal is then searched for in the direction of @xmath16 .",
    "we have chosen to use three ir beams ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , with the signal expected in the visible ( @xmath19 ) .    in this configuration , the photons of the input beams that scatter in the residual plasma or on the optics can be spatially and spectrally filtered out , and the signal can be easily detected .",
    "for strong signal isolation , the wavelength of the signal is also chosen to be far from the wavelengths of the harmonics of the input beams , which are always present in a high intensity beam .",
    "of the four beams on the pupil plane of the bowen are shown . ]",
    "the 3 beams are focused by a single optics made of a pair of spherical mirrors ( bowen ) with a coronal pupil of width 30  mm , and an equivalent focal length of 100  mm .",
    "the paraxial surface of the bowen is a cone with a half angle of 33.6@xmath20 .",
    "a left - right symmetric configuration is chosen ( fig .",
    "[ config ] ) with the main beams at an angle @xmath21 with respect to the vertical direction ; with @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 .",
    "as the three beams are injected on that cone , the expected signal lies also on the cone .",
    "the characteristics of the beams are chosen so as to optimize their overlap at the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "the optimum is obtained for beams with the waist @xmath24 on the order of the fwhm bunch length @xmath25 .",
    "the two main beams ( # 1 and # 2 ) at 805  nm are produced by a ti : sapphire chirped pulse amplification ( cpa ) laser chain with 3 amplifying stages@xcite .",
    "gaussian beams with 0.4  j of energy , 55  nm spectral width , and 40  fs fwhm duration are delivered at 10  hz .",
    "a pair of tunable frustrated internal reflection attenuators allows the reduction of the intensity of the main beams without degrading their optical quality or modifying their angle and temporal synchronisation .",
    "then , the two beams enter a vacuum chamber where they are expanded to a diameter @xmath26 mm .",
    "the chirped pulses are temporally compressed to 40  fs , and are transported to the experimental chamber .",
    "a fraction of the beam is collected after the second amplification stage to pump the optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) that produces the beam at 1300  nm .",
    "the 3 beams are injected into the bowen with a diameter @xmath27 of 30  mm .",
    "a low intensity image of the focal spot of each beam is obtained outside the chamber with a unit magnification by a combination of a silica slide and of a non coated silica spherical mirror ( fig .",
    "[ schemaexp ] ) .",
    "the image is enlarged by a microscope objective with a magnification of 40 ( 20 for the 1300  nm beam for which the ccd sensitivity is low ) onto a ccd camera .",
    "a set of dielectric mirrors with graded reflectivities at 800  nm are used as filters down to an optical density of @xmath28 , before and after the objective .",
    "typical spot sizes at @xmath29 in intensity , @xmath24 , of 4  @xmath30 m ( main beams ) and 6  @xmath30 m ( 1300  nm beam ) are obtained .",
    "the expected signal photons are collected by a telescope with an @xmath31 number of 1.9 , imaged onto the entrance slit of a spectrometer with a transmission factor of 59  % at 577  nm , and detected with a photomultiplier ( pmt ) with an efficiency of 5  % . a bg38 filter further blocks the ir photons .",
    "the signal from the pmt is 10  ns in duration at the foot and is digitized by a camac adc with a gate of 25  ns .",
    "the relative alignment and synchronisation procedures of the three beams at the ip are dependent on each other due to the configuration used .",
    "they are performed in several steps .",
    "first , the three beams are prealigned at ip on a single camera located on the axis of the bowen , using a microscope objective with a large numerical aperture of 0.65 , and their waists are brought into a common plane perpendicular to that axis .",
    "the position of the 3 spots in that plane is adjusted so as to minimize their aberrations . then",
    ", a pre - synchronisation of the laser pulses is performed with a precision of 25  ps with a fast diode and a 7  ghz oscilloscope .",
    "the fine alignment is obtained by having each laser punch the same hole in a 10  @xmath30 m thick aluminum foil .",
    "the synchronisation is then refined down to 100  fs by observing the perturbation of the focal spot of a low energy beam after a plasma was created by a high energy beam in a nitrogen gas jet with a pressure of about 0.3  bar . at last ,",
    "the fine synchronisation is performed by observing four wave mixing ( @xmath32 ) in the gas jet .    for this last step ,",
    "the laser intensities are tuned just below plasma threshold .",
    "this method results in the spatial alignment and the synchronisation of the beams with the upmost precision .",
    "furthermore it maximizes the signal in exactly the same configuration as that for the experiment in vacuum .",
    "this point is detailed in the following section .",
    "four wave mixing is a non linear process that appears in the interaction of high intensity light beams in a medium .",
    "the evolution of the fields in the medium are described by maxwell s equation in a non magnetic medium  : @xmath33 where the polarisation of the medium is developed as a function of the field in the `` constitutive '' relations  : @xmath34 here we study the interaction of three incoming beams .",
    "we see that a source term is present , that is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , it contains a term proportional to @xmath36 with holds exactly . in a low pressure gas ,",
    "the refractive indices at the four wavelengths are close enough so that @xmath37 , i.e. more precisely @xmath38 . ]",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a paraxial formulation for that component @xmath41 along @xmath42 , in the slow varying wave approximation gives  : @xmath43    let s now turn to qed stimulated photon scattering in vacuum .",

    ", we get  : @xmath48\\ ] ]    @xmath49    @xmath50 is a factor that depends on the directions of the incident beams and of their polarisation ( @xmath51 ) . in our configuration , we have @xmath52@xcite .    the equations describing the growth rate of @xmath53 of 4 wave mixing in a low pressure gas ( eq .",
    "[ danslegaz ] ) and of stimulated photon scattering in vacuum ( eq . [ eqref ] ) have the same form .",
    "therefore we can define@xcite the qed susceptibility of vacuum  : @xmath54",
    "the typical sensitivity of the delay of the third beam is on the order of 20  fs , which shows that the duration of the beam provided by the opa is similar to that of the pump beam .",
    "the main source of fluctuation of the @xmath32 signal is caused by a vertical oscillation of beam # 2 due to the pumping system of the compressor .",
    "this produces a periodic variation of the signal with an average loss factor equal to 5 .",
    "the search of a signal in vacuum was interspersed by the observation of the @xmath32 signal in the gas jet .",
    "this signal showed an excellent long term stability  : after a fraction of an hour the @xmath32 signal was still present , and of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the @xmath32 signal was observed with laser energies set just below plasma threshold .",
    "we can obtain an upper bound of this laser energy from the intensity threshold @xmath55 of ionization of nitrogen , close to @xmath56  : @xmath57 that is @xmath58j . up to @xmath59 photons",
    "were observed .",
    "the origin of the signal is identified as four wave mixing in the gas , because it is present only with the three beams injected .",
    "furthermore , its spectrum is found to peak at the wavelength @xmath60 of four wave mixing ( fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "the fwhm spectral width , @xmath61 , corresponds to a fourier limited fwhm duration of @xmath62 . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first observation of large angle four wave mixing .",
    "we compute the expected number of observed scattered photons from the integration of equation ( [ danslegaz ] ) .",
    "we get approximately  : @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the energy of the three incoming laser pulses , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , are the quantum efficiency of the pmt , the transmission of the spectrometer , and the loss factor due to a transverse oscillation of beam 2 .",
    "the third order susceptibility of nitrogen has been measured by other experiments , in different configurations .",
    "et al . _ have measured the red shift of short pulse spectra due to self phase modulation ( spm ) @xcite .",
    "the value of the nonlinear refractive index , measured at 1 bar , is @xmath68@xcite .",
    "that value of @xmath69 is related to the third order susceptibility by  : @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 .",
    "note that the ratio of the third order susceptibilities in vacuum and in gas with pressure @xmath72 is @xmath73 : the qed vacuum is indeed linear to a very good approximation .",
    "the two contributions ( four wave mixing in a gas and qed stimulated photon scattering ) are of the same order of magnitude only for a pressure close to @xmath74 .    here , at a pressure of about 0.3  bar , the expected number of photons is @xmath75 .",
    "the value of @xmath76 has been also measured by lehmeier _",
    "_ in third harmonic generation ( thg ) in nitrogen by a picosecond nd : glass laser pulse@xcite .",
    "the obtained value , @xmath77 , is about ten times lower than for self phase modulation , and the corresponding value of @xmath78 is @xmath79 .",
    "these numbers are of the same order of magnitude of the number of photons observed in this experiment .",
    "a signal was searched for in vacuum with laser energies of 150  mj , 55  mj and 200  @xmath30j , and with a spectral acceptance of 30  nm .",
    "after compression , transport , and taking into account only the energy that is contained in the central spot at focus , only a fraction of the laser energy is actually available .",
    "an estimate of that fraction has been obtained by a subsequent experiment , that has studied precisely the threshold of helium ionization by a single beam@xcite .",
    "we use here a conservative number of 3% .    at high residual pressure ( @xmath80 )",

    "[ pressure ] ) .",
    "the one photo - electron signal is easily identified from the pedestal ( fig . [ spectreadc ] ) .    at lower pressure , the remaining noise is due to the creation of white light on a specific imperfect part of the optics that could not be fixed .",
    "data were taken at @xmath81 , with an integration time of 100  s ; that is 1000 laser shots . for most of the laser shots ,",
