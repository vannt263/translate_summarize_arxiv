    "<S> although we have observed @xmath8 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) in our experiments , it does not mean we have observed sub - possion distribution or photon antibunching . </S>",

    "<S> these two effects can only be observed with nonclassical light . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 and @xmath57 observed in our experiments are in a hom interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> these two interferometers are different . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the experimental results in our experiments do not satisfy the definitions of sub - possion distribution or photon antibunching .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have observed the spatial second - order interference pattern of laser and pseudothermal light beams in a hom interferometer , in which , two - photon anticorrelation is observed when these two detectors are at the symmetrical positions . </S>",
    "<S> further more , temporal hom dip is also observed when these two detectors are at the symmetrical positions . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical interpretations based on two - photon interference theory agree with the experimental results very well . </S>",
    "<S> two - photon anticorrelation with laser and pseudothermal light in a hom interferometer can be interpreted by the destructive two - photon interference , which is the same interpretation as two - photon anticorrelation with entangled photon pairs in a hom interferometer . </S>"
