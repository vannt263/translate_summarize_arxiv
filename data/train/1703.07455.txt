    "the resemblance between the geodesic flow of a compact surface of genus greater than one and without conjugate points and the geodesic flow of a compact surface with constant negative curvature has been source of deep research in geometry and topological dynamics from the beginning of the 20th century .",
    "the first and perhaps most influential work in the subject is the work by morse @xcite showing that every globally minimizing geodesic in the universal covering of a compact surface of genus greater than one is `` shadowed '' by a geodesic in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "this beautiful result strongly suggested that the geodesic flow of a compact surface without conjugate points and of higher genus should be semi - conjugate to the geodesic flows of a constant negative curvature surface .",
    "recall that two continuous flows @xmath0 and @xmath1 acting on compact metric spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 are _ semi - conjugate _ if there exists a continuous and surjective map @xmath4 such that for each @xmath5 there exists a continuous and surjective reparametrization @xmath6 such that @xmath7 the map @xmath8 is called a _ semi - conjugacy _ ; if @xmath8 is a homeomorphism then it is called a _ conjugacy _ and the flows are said to be _ semi - conjugate_. observe that @xmath8 maps orbits to orbits .",
    "we say that @xmath9 is _ time - preserving semi - conjugate _ to @xmath10 if @xmath11 is the identity for every @xmath12 .",
    "the existence of conjugacies to nearby flows in a @xmath13 neighborhood characterizes _ structurally stable flows _ , that is , axiom a flows and , in particular , anosov flows .",
    "structural stability theory was developed in the 60s and 70s and its main ideas paved the path to study also systems which show only weaker forms of stability like topological stability .",
    "a system is _",
    "@xmath14-topologically stable _ if it is semi - conjugate to any nearby @xmath14 system .",
    "of course , @xmath14-structurally stable systems are @xmath14-topologically stable .",
    "but the converse is not true and there are many well known counterexamples , many of them in the category of expansive , non - hyperbolic systems .",
    "a continuous flow @xmath15 without singular points on a metric space @xmath16 is _ _ expansive _ _ if there exists @xmath17 such that for every @xmath18 and for every @xmath19 for which there exists a continuous surjective function @xmath20 with @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 for every @xmath23 we have @xmath24 for some @xmath25 .",
    "we call such @xmath26 an _ expansivity constant_.    the definition of expansive homeomorphism introduced by bowen is previous to the above definition for flows ( see also  @xcite ) , and bowen s study of expansive homeomorphisms showed how to find weak stability properties in non - hyperbolic geodesic flows using a dynamical approach rather than the global geometry approach suggested by morse s ideas .",
    "bowen @xcite and bowen and walters @xcite pointed out that expansive systems with a local product structure are @xmath27-topologically stable ( see also @xcite in the case of flows ) ; lewowicz @xcite and hiraide @xcite showed that expansive homeomorphisms of compact surfaces have an  almost \" local product structure .",
    "paternain @xcite and inaba and matsumoto @xcite extended lewowicz s work to show that expansive geodesic flows of compact surfaces have a local product structure and hence that they are @xmath28-topologically stable .",
    "ruggiero @xcite showed that expansive geodesic flows of compact manifolds without conjugate points have a local product structure , which also implies topological stability .",
    "the global geometry point of view of weak stability theory of geodesic flows enjoyed an large development in the 70s .",
    "one can mention the works of eberlein @xcite and eberlein and oneill @xcite about visibility manifolds extending morse s  @xcite work : quasi - geodesics in visibility manifolds are close to true geodesics .",
    "the theory of visibility manifolds went further and introduced a whole body of tools to study coarse hyperbolic geometry of manifolds .",
    "thurston and gromov @xcite introduced the notion of hyperbolic groups and not only extended eberlein s theory of visibility manifolds but created a rich theory to study coarse hyperbolic geometry in very general metric spaces .",
    "all the above results suggest that the family of geodesic flows which are semi - conjugate to a geodesic flow of a manifold with negative curvature could be much larger than only the family of geodesic flows of compact surfaces without conjugate points .    in the 80s ,",
    "ghys @xcite proved the existence of a semi - conjugacy between the geodesic flow of a compact surface without conjugate points and of genus greater than one and a hyperbolic _ geodesic _ flow .",
    "however , in general , this semi - conjugacy is _ not _ time - preserving , that is , the reparametrization @xmath29 is not the identity . while any semi - conjugacy between discrete systems is time preserving by definition , the existence of such a semi - conjugacy for flows is a much more delicate issue .",
    "time - preserving semi - conjugacies are intimately related to spectral rigidity problems in continuous dynamical systems and in particular in riemannian geometry : two geodesic flows which are time - preserving semi - conjugate have the same marked length spectrum of periodic geodesics .",
    "indeed , the work of otal @xcite , croke @xcite , and croke and fathi @xcite , shows that if this is the case of the geodesic flows of two compact surfaces without conjugate points and of genus greater than one then both surfaces are in fact isometric .    in view of the above",
    ", the main result result of the present article looks perhaps surprising .",
    "[ quotient ] let @xmath30 be a @xmath31 compact connected boundaryless surface without focal points and genus greater than one .",
    "let @xmath32 be its geodesic flow .",
    "then there exists a compact 3-manifold @xmath3 diffeomorphic to @xmath33 and a continuous flow @xmath34 which is expansive and has a local product structure such that @xmath9 is time - preserving semi - conjugate to @xmath10 .",
    "so expansive flows arise as models of geodesic flows of compact surfaces without focal points and of genus greater than one up to time - preserving semi - conjugacies . by the above mentioned spectral rigidity",
    ", we can not expect that the the model flow @xmath35 is the geodesic flow of a compact surface if the original flow is non - expansive .",
    "this is why ghys s method @xcite does not provide a _ time - reserving _ semi - conjugacy . indeed ,",
    "if the model flow @xmath35 was a geodesic flow then we would know that the corresponding surface would have no conjugate points by the result of paternain @xcite .",
    "therefore , we could apply the spectral rigidity results mentioned above to show that both surfaces would have to be isometric .",
    "but the initial geodesic flow will not be expansive in general due to flat strips in the unit tangent bundle ( see section  [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "the existence of a time - preserving semi - conjugacy to an expansive flow has some interesting applications in topological dynamics .",
    "in fact , this expansive flow inherits most of the features of the topological hyperbolic dynamics which are found in the theory of expansive geodesic flows in manifolds without conjugate points ( see theorem  [ expansivity ] and compare  @xcite ) .",
    "these results play a crucial role in the proof of the following result which is related to the thermodynamical formalism and ergodic optimization and gives a first example of possible applications of theorem  [ quotient ] .",
    "[ maximalentropy ] the geodesic flow of a @xmath31 compact connected boundaryless surface without focal points and of genus greater than one has a unique ( hence ergodic ) invariant probability measure of maximal entropy .",
    "theorem [ maximalentropy ] extends knieper s result @xcite about the uniqueness of maximal entropy measures for rank one geodesic flows in manifolds with nonpositive curvature ( note that there exist surfaces without focal points which admit some regions with positive curvature ) .",
    "our approach to show theorem [ maximalentropy ] is closer to the classical one in thermodynamics that works very well for expansive systems . since the geodesic flow in theorem [ maximalentropy ] might not be expansive , we combine theorem [ quotient ] with a recent result by buzzi et al .",
    "@xcite which reduces the study of the maximal entropy measure of a so - called extension of an expansive system to the study of maximal entropy measures of expansive ones ( see section  [ sec : entropystatement ] ) .",
    "the main idea to prove theorem [ quotient ] is in many ways a very natural one : the geodesic flow of a compact surface without conjugate points and of higher genus is not expansive in general .",
    "it may have regions of non - expansivity , that in the case of a surface without focal points consist precisely of flat strips .",
    "so we define an equivalence relation in the unit tangent bundle of the surface that identifies points in the same strip ( see section  [ stripproperties ] , where further properties of such strips are studied ) .",
    "this relation induces naturally a quotient flow which preserves the classes and the time parametrization of the initial geodesic flow .",
    "the quotient space then carries a flow without  non - expansive \" orbits , and the hard part of the proof consists in showing that the quotient space has a good topological structure .",
    "we show that the quotient space is a topological 3-manifold , and hence carries a smooth manifold structure ( see section  [ quotientstructure ] ) .",
    "finally , we show that the quotient flow is expansive with respect to any metric defined on the quotient space ( see section  [ sec : dynquoflo ] ) .",
