    "biophysical processes of cell polarization have attracted large interest in recent times .",
    "it has been observed that intriguing similarities exist in the polarization of such diverse biological systems as cells of the immune system , social amoebas , budding yeast , and amphibian eggs @xcite .",
    "this suggests that cell polarization may be a highly universal phenomenon .",
    "one of the best studied examples of the role of biochemical cell membrane polarization in eukaryotic cells is chemotaxis .",
    "chemotaxis is the ability of cells to sense spatial gradients of attractant factors , governing the development of all superior organisms .",
    "eukaryotic cells are endowed with an extremely sensible chemical compass allowing them to orient toward sources of soluble chemical signals .",
    "this mechanism is the result of billion years of evolution , and multicellular organisms would not exist without it .",
    "slight gradients in the external signals produced by the environment induce the formation of oriented domains of signaling molecules on the cell membrane surface .",
    "afterwards , these signaling domains induce differentiated polymerization of the cell cytoskeleton in their proximity , inducing the formation of a growing head and a retracting tail , and eventually directed motion towards the attractant source .",
    "it has been suggested in the biological literature that domains of signaling molecules are self - organized structures @xcite . in this paper",
    "we confirm that this expectation may be substantiated by the use of statistical mechanical methods , leading to the prediction that universal features typical of coarsening processes in phase - ordering systems should be observable in polarizing cells .",
    "we also describe here a concrete realization of our scheme in the process of eukaryotic chemotaxis , based on the analysis of available biochemical and biophysical data .",
    "part of the results presented here have been briefly reported in a previous letter @xcite .",
    "stochastic reaction - diffusion systems are a natural paradigm for describing in physical terms the biochemical processes taking place in the living cell , since the cytosol and cell membrane are inherently diffusive environments .",
    "although active transport processes also take place in the cell , they regard mainly vesicles , organelles and large multiprotein complexes , while smaller cell constituents move diffusively . thermal agitation and the intrinsic stochasticity in the advancement of chemical reactions",
    "provide natural sources of noise .",
    "most reactions in the cellular environment would be very slow if they were not favored by the action of catalysts .",
    "small numbers of enzymatic molecules ( @xmath0@xmath1 per cell ) control the speed of chemical reactions involving much larger numbers of substrate molecules ( @xmath1@xmath2 per cell . )",
    "often , the substrate concentration in its turn controls the catalyst activity , so that the response of the system becomes nonlinear .",
    "most biochemically relevant reactions involve enzyme - substrate couples and are part of networks of interconnected autocatalytic reactions .",
    "nonlinearities allow in principle the system to realize several stable biochemical phases , characterized by different concentrations of chemical factors @xcite .",
    "transitions between different phases in reaction - diffusion systems have been observed in purely physical settings , such as the adsorption and reaction of gases on catalytic surfaces @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that a similar process of nonequilibrium phase separation may be at the heart of directional sensing in higher eukaryotes @xcite .    in eukaryotic directional sensing cells exposed to shallow gradients of external attractant factors",

    "phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate _",
    "( pip@xmath3 ) and the pip3-producing enzyme _",
    "phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase _ ( pi3k ) on the cell membrane side exposed to the highest attractant concentrations , while _ phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate _ ( pip2 ) and",
    "the pip2-producing enzyme _ phosphatase and tensin homolog _ ( pten ) accumulate on the complementary side @xcite ( see [ app : lattice ] for a more abstract description of the relative roles of these signaling molecules . )",
    "accurate quantitative experiments @xcite performed by exposing _ dictyostelium _ cells to controlled attractant gradients showed that uniform concentrations of external attractant factor induce a predominant , uniform concentration of pip3 and pi3k on the cell membrane , and do not immediately result in cell polarization and motion .",
    "however , slight gradients in the distribution of the attractant factor induce the formation of two complementary domains , one rich in pip3 and pi3k , and one rich in pip2 and pten , in times of the order of a few minutes .",
    "this early breaking of the spherical symmetry of the cell membrane induces cell polarization and motion @xcite .",
    "uniformly stimulated cells observed over longer timescales ( of the order of 1 hour ) are seen to polarize stochastically and move in random directions .",
    "numerical simulations of a stochastic reaction - diffusion model of the process suggest that both the early , large amplification of slight attractant gradients and the separate phenomenon of late , random polarization under uniform stimulation are explained by the proximity of the system to a spontaneous phase separation driven by non - linear autocatalytic interactions @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "cell polarization is the final result of a nucleation process by which domains rich in pip3 and pi3k are created in a sea rich in pip2 and pten , or vice versa , depending on initial conditions and activation patterns .",
    "the polarization process is accomplished when pure pip2 and pip3 rich domains grow to sizes comparable to the size of the cell .",
    "gradient activation patterns strongly influence the kinetic of domain growth and coalescence , taking advantage of the underlying phase - separation instability .",
    "this way , the peculiar reaction - diffusion dynamics taking place on the surface of the cell membrane works as a powerful amplifier of slight anisotropies in the distribution of the external chemical signal .    in this statistical mechanical point of view ,",
    "random and gradient - driven polarization appear as two faces of the same coin , in good agreement with some of the existing biological intuition @xcite .    to better understand the process of spontaneous and gradient - driven cell polarization from a physical point of view it is convenient to describe the corresponding signaling network in abstract terms , _",
    "i.e. _ forgetting about the particular nature of the molecules involved and considering only the general structure of the network .",
    "this approach has the potential to provide a unified description of polarization phenomena in distant biological systems .    in our abstract signaling network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] ) a system or receptors transduces an external distribution of chemical attractant into an internal distribution of activated enzymes @xmath4 , which catalyze the switch of a signaling molecule between two states , that we denote here as @xmath5 and @xmath6 . a counteracting enzyme @xmath7 transforms the @xmath6 state back into @xmath5 .",
    "the molecule @xmath5 in turn activates @xmath7 , thus realizing a positive feedback loop .    the signaling molecules @xmath6 , @xmath5 are permanently bound to the cell surface @xmath8 and perform diffusive motions on it , while the @xmath7 enzymes are free to shuttle between the cytosolic reservoir and the membrane . in a more complete description we should consider that also the @xmath4 enzymes are shuttling from the cytosol to the membrane @xcite . here",
    "however for simplicity we represent with @xmath4 only the receptor - bound fraction , which we identify with the external activation field .",
    "the diffusivity of @xmath7 enzymes in the cytosol is much higher than the diffusivity of @xmath9 molecules on the cell membrane , therefore membrane - bound @xmath7 enzymes may be assumed to be in approximate equilibrium with the @xmath9 concentration field .",
    "this fact leaves only the @xmath9 surface molecule concentration as relevant dynamic variables .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath10 molecules may only be converted into each other , we are left with only one relevant degree of freedom , their difference @xmath11 .",
    "the model of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] was initially introduced to describe chemotactic polarization in higher eukaryotes @xcite . in that case , we identify @xmath5 and @xmath6 with pip2 and pip3 , @xmath7 with activated pten , and @xmath4 with activated pi3k .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that polarization of budding yeast ( a lower eukaryote ) may be the result of an amplifying feedback loop similar to the one described in fig .",

    "@xcite lacks a counteracting enzyme playing the role of @xmath4 in the scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , and is therefore not bistable . for this reason",
    ", it can reproduce only stochastic , intermittent polarization , as is observed at the border of the bistability region in the case of chemotactic polarization @xcite .",
    "however , in a recent work @xcite a counteracting cdc42 deactivating factor that could play the role of @xmath4 has been described .",
    "this suggests that polarization of budding yeast cells may be driven by a bistable potential allowing the realization of stable polarization , similarly to the case of chemotactic polarization of higher eukaryotes .",
    "cell polarization is a macroscopic effect , emerging from the stochastic dynamics of a network of chemical reactions taking place in occasion of the random encounters of specific signaling molecules which perform diffusive motions and shuttle between the cell cytosol and membrane @xcite .",
    "a large amount of information has been collected in recent years about the biochemical aspects of cell polarization in higher @xcite and lower @xcite eukaryotes .",
    "however , available data can not be considered yet complete or quantitative to a satisfactory degree .",
    "this kind of situation is typical of present efforts to derive macroscopic aspects of cell behavior from noisy and yet poorly quantitative data about the relevant microscopic interactions .",
    "it is therefore extremely important that a sensible macroscopic description of cell polarization can be given , starting only from the knowledge of a few robust properties of the biophysical system .    in this section",
    "we develop such a description . in the next section",
    "we show how known examples of cell polarization fit in our general scheme .",
    "let us start here by assuming that we have knowledge only about the following robust properties of the cell polarization process :    _ single component order parameter : _ the state of the system may be effectively described in terms of the configurations of a single - component concentration field @xmath12 describing the distribution of a set of signaling molecules on the cell membrane  @xmath8 .    _ bistability : _ the underlying chemical reaction networks allows the realization of distinct , locally stable chemical phases .",
    "_ self - tuning : _ a global feedback mechanism controls the metastability degree @xmath13 of the system and drives it towards a state of phase coexistence .    _ non - conserved field : _ there are no local constraints on the values assumed by the field @xmath12 .",
    "the present set of properties stems from the abstraction of known properties of eukaryotic polarization ( see also the next section ) .",
    "in particular , property 4 . is the consequence of the fast diffusion of @xmath7 enzymes across the cytosolic volume @xcite .",
    "( it is worth mentioning here that our framework would still hold , although with a few differences , also in the case that property 4 .",

    "the @xmath12 field is not constrained by a local conservation law because @xmath6 molecules can be freely converted into @xmath5 molecules and back on any point of the cell surface .",

    "one may wonder whether a cell may become polarized by transient gradients produced by a spontaneous fluctuation in the external distribution of attractant molecules , or fluctuations in receptor - ligand binding , as has been suggested in the literature @xcite .",
    "since eukaryotic cells typically carry 10@xmath10610@xmath107 receptors for attractant factors , one expects spontaneous fluctuations in the fraction of activated receptors to be of the order of 10@xmath108 , a value which is comparable to observed anisotropy thresholds .",
    "however , to actually produce directed polarization the fluctuation should sustain itself for several minutes , i.e. for a time comparable to the characteristic polarization time ( such as @xmath89 ) .",
    "such an event has very low probability of being observed since the correlation time of the fluctuations determined by attractant diffusion at the cell scale and the characteristic times of receptor - ligand kinetics are much less than the polarization time .",

    "therefore , the direction of cell polarization in the case of a homogeneous distribution of attractant can only be determined by the inhomogeneity in the initial distribution of the positions of pip2-rich germs produced by thermal fluctuations .",
    "by using standard statistical mechanical methods we have shown that the dynamics of signaling domains in cell polarization is independent on the nature of the signaling molecules and the values of kinetic rate constants , as long as some very general conditions are met :    [ prop : a]timescale separation allows to describe the polarization process in terms of a single concentration field of signaling molecules on the cell membrane .",

    "the universal properties of cell polarization emerge from properties of domain growth which have been extensively studied in first - order phase transitions@xcite .",
    "the similarity of the two problems follows from the fact that fast degrees of freedom of chemical kinetics are in approximate equilibrium with slower degrees of freedom , which can be described by means of an effective free energy functional .",
    "it is worth observing that in the biological system studied here , there is no direct interaction between signaling molecules , similar to the one observed in solid state system such as binary alloys , but only an effective interaction mediated by enzyme activity , binding , unbinding and diffusion processes .",
    "our theoretical scheme allows to shed light on some non trivial questions , such as the mechanism of directional sensing and the effect of random fluctuations of the medium on the polarization process .",
    "random polarization appears as the result of the intrinsic stochasticity of the process of domain nucleation and not of random fluctuations of the medium .",
    "random and gradient - induced polarization appear as the two sides of a same coin .",
    "our scheme provides an explanation of why spatial directional sensing is not observed in the small prokaryotic cells , and provides asymptotic estimates for polarization times and threshold detectable gradients .",
    "an important component of our picture is the existence of a global coupling of the degree of metastability to the state of the system @xcite .",
    "the constrained phase - ordering dynamics tunes the system towards phase coexistence , similarly to what happens in the case of a precipitating supersaturated solution . the global control allowing self - tuning to phase - coexistence is realized by shuttling of enzymes from the cytosol to the cell membrane and backwards .",
    "some of the features that we have observed in cell polarization have been considered in previous works , such as the fact that equations of the form ( [ langinz ] ) are relevant for the description of systems of bistable chemical reactions @xcite , and that global couplings in activator - inhibitor reaction - diffusion systems may lead to the formation of stable spatiotemporal patterns @xcite .",
    "the peculiar properties of this kind of systems have led to the use of the term of _ excitable _ or _ active _ media .  using this same language",
    ", we can say that the cell membrane acts as an active medium responding to the stimulation with the formation of domains of a new phase .",
    "our work proposes that directional sensing results from the peculiar , universal features of the phase - ordering dynamics of these domains .    from a biological point of view",
    ", the universality of the polarization process allows the cell to behave in a robust , predictable way , independent on microscopic peculiarities such as the precise values of reaction rates and diffusion constants .",
    "we first proposed that chemotactic cell polarization may result from the simple ingredients of bistability induced by a positive local feedback loop in a signaling network and global control induced by shuttling of enzymes between the cytosol and the membrane in our previous works @xcite .",
    "other authors have proposed similar models , either independently @xcite or subsequently @xcite ( a review of models of chemotactic polarization can be found in ref .",
