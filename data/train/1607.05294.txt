    "information stored in spin states can also propagate through a network of coupled spins without charge transport , mediated directly by quantum - mechanical interactions .",
    "this is of particular interest as devices that do not rely on charge transport are not limited by heat dissipation due to resistance  potentially enabling higher component densities and greater energy efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the realization of novel spintronic devices presents many technological challenges in device design and fabrication .",
    "utilizing information encoded in spin degrees of freedom especially requires efficient , controlled on - chip transfer of excitations in spin networks . in quantum mechanical language",
    ", this transfer or transport of an excitation from one site to another requires to steer the system from one quantum state to another , a problem akin to the well known unit step response of linear single degree of freedom ( sdof ) tracking controllers  with the significant difference of the presence of a global phase factor in the tracking error . as propagation of spin - based information",
    "is fundamentally governed by quantum - mechanics and the schrdinger equation , however , excitations in a spin network propagate , disperse and refocus in a wave - like manner .",
    "controlling information transport in such networks is thus a highly non - classical control problem .",
    "previous work has shown that natural transmission of information does occur , but without active control the propagation of spin - based information in such networks can be slow and inefficient  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider how control can optimize transport in terms of transfer efficiency , speed and robustness .",
    "this requires an approach quite different from modern robust control , where time - domain specifications are substituted for conventional singular value bode plots .",
    "the need for state - selective transfer makes the architecture depart from the sdof configuration and precludes control designs that ensure _ asymptotic stability _ of the target state .",
    "instead , we rely on the concept of _ anderson localization _  @xcite , which is utilized to hold the system at or around the desired target state for future use .",
    "we explore how information transfer or localization in spin networks can be controlled simply by shaping the energy landscape of the system .",
    "we show how the latter problem can be viewed in terms of feedback control laws , and that feedback control designs that achieve the best performance w.r.t .",
    "transfer fidelity also achieve the best robustness .",
    "this is unlike the traditional limitations observed for sdof classical control and demonstrates the advantages of two degrees - of - freedom controllers  @xcite and the setup adopted here .",

    "fcls such as eq .",
    "are sometimes referred to as model - based feedback as the feedback is dependent on the evolution operator @xmath45 of the system , which can not be measured directly .",

    "all of these paradigms , however , also have limitations and drawbacks .",
    "dynamic control , for example , requires the ability to temporally modulate interactions , often at significant speed and time resolution . besides ,",
    "for networks with a high degree of symmetry such as rings with uniform coupling , controllability is often limited by dynamic symmetries , which imposes restrictions on what can be achieved , especially with local actuators  @xcite .",

    "specifically , we wish to design simple fcl s , @xmath58 with @xmath53 being time - invariant , giving rise to a linear control system @xmath59 where @xmath8 is the identity matrix .",
    "note that @xmath51 and @xmath45 are complex operators but we could trivially transform the system into a real system .",
    "dynamic control problems have been formulated in terms of model - based feedback and techniques such as lyapunov control have been successfully applied to these problems , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "our aim , in contrast , is to find constant fcls for certain tasks , while at the same time restricting the hamiltonian to have a simple form .",
    "our main control objective is to transfer an initial state @xmath60 , corresponding to the initial excitation of the system on spin @xmath61 , to a desired target state @xmath62 , corresponding to the excitation on spin @xmath63 , for any given pair @xmath64 of initial and target spins .",
    "mathematically , we formulate the problem of arbitrary state transfer ( not limited to single excitation states ) as finding an _ input - output map _ given by a unitary operator @xmath65 that maximizes the ( squared ) _ fidelity _ or _ probability of successful transfer _ from @xmath66 to @xmath67 in an amount of time @xmath68 : @xmath69    in practice , readout of information is generally not instantaneous but takes place over a finite time window . in this case",
    "it is more advantageous to maximize the _ average transfer fidelity _ for a given readout time window @xmath70 , @xmath71 setting @xmath72 and choosing a large readout time window @xmath70 we can suppress transport from time @xmath73 to @xmath68 and _ localize _ or _ freeze excitations _ at a particular node for later use by maximizing @xmath74 .",

    "the flipside of this selectivity requirement is that we can not hope to engineer a process that renders the target state asymptotically stable but can only expect lyapunov stability or anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in control of information transfer by _ shaping _ the potential _ energy landscape _ of the system ( see fig .  [ fig : landscape ] ) .",

    "it is often preferable to modify the objective slightly and aim to find a fcl that achieves a desired transfer in _ minimum time _ with a certain _ margin of error _ , as we do not necessarily require perfect state transfer but only that the final state be sufficiently close , up to a global phase factor , to the desired target state .",
    "finding fcls for information transfer in spin networks thus reduces to an optimization problem , which can be solved using standard optimization tools .",
    "however , the optimization landscape is very challenging , in particular when the goal is to find a control that achieves the highest possible fidelity in the shortest time possible , possibly subject to various other constraints .",
    "there are many open questions regarding the existence of fcls that achieve _ perfect _ state transfer , in _",

    "when the actuators are constrained is not obvious .",
    "furthermore , even if such fcls exist , information transfer is usually subject to _ speed limits_. while it is nontrivial to derive speed limits for arbitrary quantum networks , we can derive lower bounds on the transfer time in certain cases , which can be used as performance indicators for the optimization .",

    "the constraints make them more similar to chains and the timing of the transmission peaks in the corresponding chains give good indications for the shortest possible transfer times in ring - based quantum routers .    from a control point of view , maximizing the transfer fidelity @xmath311 is equivalent to canceling the tracking error @xmath312 , but the global phase factor means that we must think of the tracking error as an element of the complex projective space @xmath313 .",
    "another difference to its classical counterpart is that our quantum feedback control scheme is not only @xmath67-selective , but @xmath66-selective as well , while classical controllers are @xmath67-selective as the target is specified by the reference signal , but the initial state is an equilibrium state .",
    "there are many open questions for this control paradigm , ranging from the optimization landscape to global optimization algorithms that utilize the specific structure of the problem to find the best control laws .",
