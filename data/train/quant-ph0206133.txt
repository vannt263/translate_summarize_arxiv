    "for efficient quantum information processing , the robust quantum memories that store information encoded in the state superposition are needed .",
    "the main obstacle in their realization arises from the difficulty to isolate a quantum mechanical system from the environment that causes decoherence effect . to avoid the decoherence ,",
    "several strategies have been developed : the quantum error correction schemes @xcite , feedback implementations @xcite , the schemes using the decoherence - free subspace @xcite , dynamical decoupling techniques @xcite and the engineering of pointer state methods @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we suggest a mechanism to physically isolate the qubit stored in the memory unit .",
    "the basic idea has been inspired by a screening effect in the electromagnetic field theory , where a device can be screened from the disturbing effects of the external electromagnetic fields , if it is closed in the earth - connected metal casing .",
    "to implement this idea in the quantum memories , we use a quantum casing system that is frequently erased to the ground state , as is depicted in fig .  1 . as the number of erasing events increases during the time evolution , the system is better isolated from an action of the zero - temperature reservoir . from different point of view , the effect reminiscents _ dynamical _ zeno effect @xcite , where the system dynamics can mimic the standard zeno effect @xcite .",
    "the possible experimental applications could be found , for example , in the cavity qed experiments to screen the atomic and photonic qubit , however , it may be also consider more generally to isolate the system from the reservoir influence .    to illustrate the properties of the screening method",
    ", we analyze the standard example of decoherence effect : atomic qubit coupled to the external reservoir on zero temperature , for review @xcite . a two - level atom placed in the free - space , initially prepared in the pure state superposition @xmath0 of the excited state @xmath1 and ground state @xmath2 and resonantly interacting with a effectively infinite reservoir of free - space vacuum modes of electromagnetic field exhibits _ exponential _ decay of the atomic state .",
    "it can be described by the following master equation in markovian approximation @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the deexcitation and excitation operators of the atomic system .",
    "after the reservoir interaction , the initial state @xmath6 transfers to the reduced density matrix @xmath7 , @xmath8 is probability of the excited state and @xmath9 , @xmath10 is atomic interference term .",
    "thus , the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 describe the energy and interference evolution in the two - level atom .",
    "the fidelity @xmath13 with initial pure atomic state @xmath6 given by @xmath14 _ exponentially _ vanishes in course of time , according to time - behavior of the depletion coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this fidelity vanishing is one from the main obstacles that inhibit the efficiency of state preserving in the qubit memories .",
    "the idea of screening is based on inserting an auxiliary casing system , as is depicted in fig .  1 and frequent erasing of its state . according to the example discussed in the previous section , we have placed the atom with rabi frequency @xmath15 in the resonant one - mode high - q cavity with damping constant @xmath16 @xcite , as is depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "the casing system is the mode of electromagnetic field inside the cavity , initially prepared in the vacuum state .",
    "we assume that the off - resonant dissipations described by the damping constant @xmath17 can be neglected in comparison with rabi frequency @xmath15 and focus on the elimination of decoherence for the resonant coupling . according to screening idea ,",
    "we in addition divide the evolution to the @xmath18 identical time interval @xmath19 by the cavity erasing . in quantum theory ,",
    "an erasure of a single unknown state @xmath20 may be thought of as ideal quantum transmission @xmath21 with some blank ground state @xmath22 followed by the damping of @xmath20 to the environment .",
    "the erasing mechanism can be implemented by an additional stream of the two - level atoms also resonantly interact with the cavity field , as is depicted in figure , and initially prepared in the ground state .",
    "the interaction is adjusted in such a way , that the photon ( emitted by the atom ) is quickly extracted in deterministic way from the cavity .",
    "consequently , the cavity field decouples from the atomic system and restores the vacuum state in the cavity . to achieve it",
    ", the rabi frequency @xmath23 of the atoms consisting the erasing mechanism must be adjusted @xmath24 .",
    "experimentally , the erasing mechanism can be implemented analogically to micromaser operation @xcite , where the condition @xmath25 can be achieved situating the atom @xmath26 near the intensity minimum of standing cavity mode , where the coupling constant is much smaller than near the maximum . on the other hand ,",
    "a stream of atoms consisting the erasing mechanism is focused into the maximum of standing cavity mode .",
    "thus , the evolution of screened two - level atom consists @xmath18 same sequential parts separated by the erasing events , in which the atom repeatedly interacts with the damped cavity in the vacuum state . the evolution between erasing events",
    "can be described in markovian approximation by the master equation for atom - field state @xmath27 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\left(2a\\rho a^{\\dag}-a^{\\dag } a\\rho-\\rho a^{\\dag}a\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is interaction hamiltonian of the resonant atom - field coupling . assuming the atom initially in the state @xmath6 and the cavity mode in the vacuum state , the master equation can be analytically solved and two regions of evolution are obtained : for the over - damped case @xmath29",
    ", the solution exhibits the hyperbolic character , which changes for the under - damped case @xmath30 in the oscillatory behavior .",
    "after tracing over the cavity field and @xmath18-times repeated evolution with erasing , we obtain the reduced density matrix ( [ marg ] ) of the two - level atom having the following coefficients for @xmath31 @xmath32^{n},\\nonumber\\\\ v_{n}(t)&=&v(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{4}\\right)\\left[\\cosh\\lambda\\frac{t}{n}+ \\frac{\\gamma}{4\\lambda}\\sinh\\lambda\\frac{t}{n}\\right]^{n},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and for @xmath34 , @xmath35^{n},\\nonumber\\\\ v_{n}(t)&=&v(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{4}\\right)\\left[1+\\frac{\\gamma}{4n}t\\right]^{n}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we arrive to the main result of the paper : as can be proved , for every value of the constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the energy depletion term @xmath36 and interference term @xmath37 tend to initial values @xmath38 and @xmath39 as the number @xmath18 of erasing events increases and consequently , the fidelity ( [ fidelity ] ) @xmath40 approaches unity in the limit @xmath41 as is depicted in fig .",
    "thus the qubit is isolated from the external influence of zero - temperature .",
    "this effect can be employed as _ screening _ of quantum system from the reservoir decoherence .",
    "the nature of this behavior is dynamical zeno effect @xcite , which is achieved by to _ non - exponential _ character of the decoherence induced by the interaction of the atom with the cavity mode .",
    "as the coupling constant @xmath15 increases , the non - exponential offset , depicted in fig .",
    "3 , is shorter and we need implement the erasing mechanism more quickly .",
    "however , number @xmath18 of erasing events during the same time interval , depicted in fig .",
    "4 , increases only sub - exponentially .",
    "note that the decoherence is the most progressive for unbalanced superpositions @xmath6 with @xmath42 ; for this reason , an unbalanced superposition has been analyzed in fig .  3 and fig .  4 .",
    "now we consider different application of the screening for the qubit state of field mode @xmath43 , where @xmath22 and @xmath44 are the vacuum and single photon states , confined in the high - q cavity .",
    "simultaneously , we will discuss an influence of the screening on the internal qubit evolution .",
    "instead of utilizing the standard one - mode cavity to confined the photon state , we consider three coupled one - mode cavities in the configuration depicted in fig .",
    "we suppose that the mode in the sandwiched cavity is under an internal interaction described by interaction hamiltonian @xmath45 . we show that an influence of the screening procedure on this internal interaction is reduced simultaneously as the erasing is more frequent . without loss of generality",
    ", we can consider that one side of the sandwiched cavity has perfect reflectivity and thus , we simplify the discussion to one - side case .",
    "this situation can be described in markovian approximation by the following heisenberg - langevin equations @xmath46,\\hspace{0.3cm}\\frac{d}{dt}b=-\\gamma b+\\kappa a+f(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is annihilation operator of the screened field mode , @xmath48 is annihilation operator of the auxiliary cavity , @xmath49 is operator langevin force of the reservoir , @xmath50 is coupling constant between the cavities , @xmath16 is damping constant and @xmath45 is interaction hamiltonian of an internal screened mode interaction . similarly to the previous example , we assume that erasing event spends a short - time interval , i.e. the condition @xmath51 is satisfied . assuming that @xmath18 is sufficiently large to satisfy the conditions @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is total time of interaction , the behavior of the screened filed mode between two erasing events can be described by the short - time approximation .",
    "then , the total evolution is expressed by iterative relation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is time interval between two erasing events , @xmath56 $ ] is lie super - operator corresponding to hamiltonian @xmath45 and @xmath57 is operator of external reservoir influence @xmath58 which exhibits vanishing normal ordered moments @xmath59 for the auxiliary mode in vacuum state and the zero - temperature reservoir . assuming finite number @xmath18 of erasing events , we can describe the evolution after @xmath18 iteration of the relation ( [ short ] ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the time dependent coefficients arising by iterative procedure , @xmath62 are independent external influence ( [ contr ] ) satisfying @xmath63=0 $ ] .",
    "the term @xmath64 vanishing in the the limit of erasing events @xmath65 and the the annihilation operator approaches @xmath66 the residual influence of the reservoir is eliminated considering ( [ prop ] ) .",
    "thus , as the number of erasing events @xmath18 increases , all the normal ordered moments are protected from the decoherence and consequently , the screened state evolve only under the internal evolution . in this way , we may manipulate with the state confined in the memory unit .    in this paper",
    ", we suggest an application of dynamical zeno effect @xcite to quantum screening of system qubit from the vacuum reservoir influence .",
    "the screening exhibits independently on the coupling and damping parameters and can be applied in both the over - damped and under - damped cases .",
    "in addition , the internal system evolution is simultaneously preserved and we thus can operate with quantum state saved in the memory .",
    "two possible experimental implementations have been pointed up , for the two - level atom and for photonic qubit state stored in the cavities .",
