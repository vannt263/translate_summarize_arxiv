    "r0.48        the kinematic range for particle production at the lhc is shown in figure [ fig : lhcbkin ] .",
    "the @xmath0 values of the pdfs are @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "smallish @xmath3 parton distributions are therefore probed by the standard production processes at the lhc , e.g. @xmath4 , at central rapidity .",
    "however , lhcb , which has a rapidity coverage of @xmath5 , automatically probes the pdfs at very low ( and high ) values of @xmath0 . at the low values the experiment constraints begin to run out and there are also potentially significant theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we can gain useful information on pdfs and qcd from both total cross - section measurements and ratios of cross - sections at lhcb @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 confidence level limit uncertainies using the preliminary mstw 2007 pdfs @xcite are shown in figure [ fig : crossunc ] .",
    "the results are exact but they can be understood more easily using some simplifications . since @xmath7 , particularly at high values of @xmath8 , and since sea quarks die away at high @xmath0 , we assume @xmath9 also at small @xmath10 we assume that @xmath11 .",
    "we finally assume that the cross - sections are dominated by up and down contributions , which is reasonable for obtaining general results . using these simplifications",
    "we obtain for the cross - section ratios the expressions @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , i.e. the sum of the squares of the vector and axial - vector couplings .",
    "the use of @xmath15 illustrates that @xmath0 values are slightly higher for @xmath16 production than for @xmath17 production .",
    "in particular the large uncertainty on @xmath18 for high @xmath8 reflects that on the high-@xmath0 down quark distribution .",
    "similarly for total cross - sections we have @xmath19 the uncertainty on @xmath20 and @xmath21 at high @xmath8 is dominated by the valence up quark and the sea quarks for @xmath22 , both of which are limited to a few percent , hence the small uncertainty in figure [ fig : crossunc ] .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath23 is dominated by the down quark for large @xmath24 , as for @xmath25 .",
    "for the virtual photon , @xmath26 , so if @xmath27 , @xmath10 can be @xmath28 and @xmath24 stays away from the valence uncertainty at high @xmath0 . the increased uncertainty when these extremely small @xmath0 values are probed is evident in the figure .",
    "depending on the cross - section under investigation , early data can either reduce the uncertainty on pdfs or test the validity of the order - by - order perturbative expansion . with @xmath29 of data lhcb @xcite expects to obtain data for @xmath30 for @xmath31 with @xmath32 precision ( ignoring luminosity uncertainty ) if presented in bins of width @xmath33 .",
    "this is sensitive to the small-@xmath0 quarks and gluon distribution for @xmath34 , but the most precise data will be in the range where hera data @xcite already provide very good constraints .",
    "however , if the data are a different shape to the prediction they can highlight problems with fixed order calculations . illustrated in figure [ fig : ztot ] is pseudo - data shifted by a mulitplicative factor @xmath35 compared to the current nlo prediction .",
    "the lower ( blue ) line shows the result of a new fit .",
    "it is not possible to obtain good agreement , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "hence , this type of result could imply that small-@xmath0 resummations are important , or that higher twists / saturation is contaminating the current extraction of small-@xmath0 pdfs from hera data .",
    "consider instead the example of @xmath29 data on @xmath37 .",
    "( in practice this will be measured as lepton asymmetry , but very similar considerations apply . )",
    "the cross - section for @xmath38 is ten times that for @xmath30 , but is more difficult to measure with more systematics .",
    "we have assumed similar uncertainties , which is perhaps conservative @xcite . in this case , assuming the data are consistent with the prediction they immediately become one of the main constraints on the down valence distribution , as shown in figure [ fig : partunc ] . again",
    "a discrepancy between data and theory could easily highlight shortcomings , but it is not very obvious what these might be in this case ( except perhaps an unexpected large @xmath39 asymmetry at small @xmath0 . )    even more dramatic is the constraint that could potentially be made by a measurement of the low - mass drell - yan cross - section . in principle",
    "the cross - section for e.g. a @xmath40 virtual photon is similar to that for the on - shell @xmath16 but the background is far more of a problem .",
    "we assume ( perhaps slightly optimistically ) that for @xmath29 the uncertainty at the lowest @xmath8 is about twice that for @xmath30 but the cross - section ( and hence statistics ) falls off less quickly with @xmath8 because the valence quark fall off is not reached .",
    "data of this type for a single mass value produce the extra constraint shown in the right of figure [ fig : partunc ] . since at these values of @xmath0 the quarks are driven by evolution from the gluon , the constraint is very similar for small-@xmath0 quarks .     from fitting to @xmath41 data ( left ) and on @xmath42 from fitting to @xmath43 for @xmath44 ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   from fitting to @xmath41 data ( left ) and on @xmath42 from fitting to @xmath43 for @xmath44 ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]          since for @xmath45 the uncertainty on pdfs is already large , a measurement of the low - mass virtual photon cross - section in one mass bin is more inclined to give an improved constraint on pdfs rather than test the theory , unless it is very different from the prediction ( more so than required for z production ) .",
    "however , measurements in the range of mass bins will be an excellent test of small-@xmath0 evolution .",
    "we already have reason to believe that the perturbative series is unstable , where use of the available nnlo matrix elements @xcite shows that for @xmath46 there is sizable variation in predictions as one goes from lo to nlo to nnlo , as shown in figure [ fig : dyplot ] .",
    "the instability can be traced to the increasing divergence of terms in the perturbative expansion as one increases the order of the calculation .",
    "this has a significant effect on both the small-@xmath0 pdfs and the matrix elements for the cross - section @xcite .",
    "measurements on low - mass drell - yan production at lhcb , and also at atlas and cms , will be important for our understanding of the convergence of the perturbative series in qcd .",
    "alternative measurements , e.g. heavy flavour production , could produce complementary information , but are less clean .    to summarise , suitable measurements at the lhc experiment will place extra constraints on pdfs and qcd which will then feed back into predictions for all quantities .",
    "lhcb has a unique reach , and precision measurements at high rapidity can probe some of the most important and interesting regions of parton kinematics , with even limited data from early running making a major impact .",
