    "a nova outburst is a cataclysmic nuclear explosion seen in the later stages of close binary star evolution .",
    "such a close binary typically comprises a white dwarf and a red dwarf that fills its roche lobe and transfers hydrogen - rich gas to its companion .",
    "when the amount of accreted material reaches a critical mass , sudden hydrogen fusion is triggered by a thermonuclear runaway on the white dwarf surface ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the released energy and material propagate through the circumstellar environment with typical ejecta velocities of the order of 1000  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the mass outflow continues until the nuclear fuel is consumed on the white dwarf , and the system then reverts back to a quiescent state with accompanying mass accretion . for extensive reviews of novae",
    "see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "two different processes can be involved in producing x - rays in quiescence .",
    "one of them is the release of gravitational energy through accretion of material onto the white dwarf ( e.g. , @xcite ) , analogous to other cataclysmic variables ( i.e. , polars , intermediate polars , and dwarf novae ) .",
    "the other is through adiabatic shocks in the nova ejecta interacting with circumstellar environment , in analogy to a miniature supernova remnant in time and space scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in either case ,",
    "x - ray detections of quiescent systems known to have undergone a nova explosion are quite rare .",
    "the new discoveries of x - ray emitting old novae provide us additional pieces to solve the puzzle of evolutionary channels in binaries followed by different kinds of cataclysmic variable activity .",
    "systematic x - ray studies of old novae are important for the purpose . however",
    ", existing wide - field x - ray surveys are not sensitive enough to detect emission from most objects in quiescence .",
    "dedicated pointed observations are necessary , often with a high risk of detecting nothing . here",
    ", the _ swift _ observatory @xcite provides an excellent opportunity to overcome the observational difficulties .",
    "its x - ray telescope , the ability of the satellite to obtain snapshot observations with short exposures , and the fill - in program to fill in gaps in the planned telescope schedule , provide an effective means for surveying potentially weak x - ray sources .    in this paper",
    ", we report the discovery of x - ray emission from the old classical nova dk lacertae ( hereafter dk lac ) for the first time . using the _ swift _ satellite , we detected a weak but significant x - ray signal 62 years after the optical discovery of its outburst . despite the limited data with poor photon statistics , we further discuss these x - ray properties and the nature of dk lac .",
    "the classical nova dk lac was discovered on 1950 january 23 at a brightness of 6  mag from photographic photometry @xcite .",
    "a peak brightness of 5.8  mag was also confirmed in data taken a day before the discovery @xcite .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic studies of the nova were subsequently conducted , which continued for about a year after the discovery ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the time evolution of the nova was moderately fast , with decline rates of @xmath9 @xmath10 19  d and @xmath11 @xmath10 32  d , where @xmath9 and @xmath11 are the time to fade by 2 and 3  mag from the optical maximum , respectively .",

    "no discrete features were found either because of the poor photon statistics or because of the real spectrum .",

    "the x - ray spectrum was also modeled using a cooling flow model originally developed for clusters of galaxies @xcite , but also known to describe emission from some cataclysmic variables @xcite . in this model ,",

    "the absorption uncertainties depend on the adopted models , and the data preclude any indication of whether there might be excess absorption related to the circumstellar medium .",
    "high energy emission in young and old novae can be divided into five known classes : ( 1 ) enigmatic non - thermal components @xcite , ( 2 ) thermal plasma due to wind shocks in ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ( 3 ) photospheric supersoft sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ( 4 ) rekindled accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and ( 5 ) extended remnant emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the former three cases are typically seen during a nova event , and the remaining two in quiescence .",
    "the 1950 outburst of dk lac was classified as a moderately fast nova , in which the event had almost terminated one year after its discovery @xcite .",
    "thus the origin of x - rays 62 years after discovery is considered to be one of the latter cases noted above , i.e. , due to rekindled accretion or nova remnant emission .",
    "one of the favored scenarios for the x - ray emission in quiescence is accretion on the white dwarf .",
    "a nova event could temporary terminate the mass accretion process through destruction of an accretion disk during the blast , and by outward hydrodynamic pressure from a strong radiatively - driven wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the accretion process would then be expected to rejuvenate over time .",
    "resumption of accretion soon after the blast has been suggested for e.g. , the recurrent nova u  sco at 10 days after outburst @xcite , the classical nova v2491  cyg at 50 days @xcite .",
    "@xcite found signs of accretion in v2487  oph 2.7 years after that outburst .",

    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , rekindled accretion in dk lac 62 years after discovery would not be an unusual scenario .",
    "the large flickerings in optical brightness , presumably from accretion activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , also support the interpretation that the process was rejuvenated .    for a nova explosion",
    ", the mass accretion rate of the binary system should be lower than @xmath1010@xmath47  @xmath66  yr@xmath3 to cause a thermonuclear runaway on a white dwarf surface without steady nuclear burning during accretion @xcite .",
    "the derived accretion rate of @xmath135@xmath110@xmath75  @xmath66  yr@xmath3 is small enough to engender a nova explosion .",
    "the time interval between nova eruptions is roughly in the range 1010@xmath76  yr or so , and mainly depends on the white dwarf mass and accretion rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of mass accretion in dk lac depends on the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf . for non - magnetic , or weakly magnetized",
    ", white dwarfs , an accretion disk is formed in the system , as in the dwarf nova case .",
    "for magnetized white dwarfs , the trajectory of infalling material is governed by the magnetic field , and an accretion funnel is formed around a magnetic pole on the white dwarf surface , as in the case of polars and intermediate polars @xcite .",
    "the estimated temperature of the x - ray emitting region of dk lac ( @xmath1310  kev ) is slightly lower than the range of those in magnetized systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but is similar to those in dwarf novae ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities are also consistent with those in other non - magnetic or weakly magnetized cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the large uncertainties of these values do not allow us to deduce the magnetic type exactly , the x - ray emission from dk lac in quiescence represent most closely that expected from rekindled accretion in dwarf novae .",
    "the other possible scenario is that x - ray emission originates from the surrounding nova remnant .",
    "the energy and material released in the nova explosion propagate through the circumstellar environment , and are expected to form a shock structure similar to those in supernova remnants . from this analogy , if we can observe nova remnants with sufficient sensitivity before the remnant energy has dissipated , we would naturally expect x - ray emission produced by adiabatic shocks .",
    "x - rays from nova remnants have only been reported in three objects to date : gk  per , rs  oph , and t  pyx .",
    "gk  per has the largest known remnant in solid angle with a radius of about 50@xmath23 ( 4@xmath110@xmath77  km at a distance of 470  pc ) , in which knots and clumps were spatially resolved in x - ray images obtained about 100 years after the outburst @xcite .",
    "an x - ray nebular spectrum was observed , characterized by a combination of a non - equilibrium ionization thermal plasma model and a power - law component convolved with photoelectric absorption .",
    "the plasma temperature and photon index were approximately 1  kev and 2 , respectively , and the x - ray luminosity was estimated to be @xmath1010@xmath7810@xmath56  ergs  s@xmath3 @xcite . while gk  per is a system for which a nova outburst has been observed only once in a human time scale , t  pyx and rs  oph are known to show such outbursts recurrently .",
    "the x - ray properties of t  pyx and rs  oph are otherwise fairly similar to those of gk  per : in all cases the presence of dense circumstellar material is expected to produce a high temperature plasma through strong shocks .",
    "the reported extended nebulae of t  pyx and rs  oph in x - rays were much more compact in solid angle than that of gk  per , with the radii of @xmath1310@xmath23 @xcite . in the case of t",
    "pyx , @xcite and @xcite find extension of less than 1@xmath23 based on _ chandra _ observations , though @xcite find no evidence for extended emission .",
    "we have noted that the current xrt data do not allow us to make a definitive conclusion regarding the presence of an extended x - ray remnant for dk  lac . at face value ,",
    "the best - fit x - ray source radius is 2@xmath23 ( figure  [ figure : dklac_conf ] ) .",
    "this value corresponds to the size of the extended optical shell @xcite , and also does not exceed the expected size of @xmath1034@xmath23 at the epochs of our x - ray observations .",
    "it corresponds to a nebular radius of 1@xmath110@xmath77  km at a distance of 3900  pc , which is of the same order as that of gk per .",
    "the estimated temperature and luminosity of dk  lac are similar to those of the other nova .",
    "if dk  lac has an extended x - ray remnant with a radius of a few arcsec , it could be confirmed with the higher spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "there are , however , three opposing arguments to the extended remnant scenario for explaining the x - ray emission .",
    "( 1 ) the difference in optical and x - ray luminosities : the upper limit of the optical flux 49 years after discovery was 6@xmath110@xmath25  ergs  @xmath6  s@xmath3  arcsec@xmath26 @xcite , which corresponds to an optical luminosity of @xmath1010@xmath79  ergs  s@xmath3  arcsec@xmath26 at a distance of 3900  pc .",
    "even if the dk lac nebular has a radius of 7@xmath23 at maximum , the x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath710@xmath8  ergs  s@xmath3 is slightly higher than that in the optical .",
    "this implies that the dominant nebular emission is in x - rays , which is not the case for other novae .",
    "( 2 ) currently , there is no clear evidence of radio emission  if dk  lac has a similar nebular to gk  per , the radio flux is expected to be about 0.3  mjy in 1.5  ghz at 3900  pc from @xcite .",
    "this is enough to be detectable but dk  lac was not observed in previous radio surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "future observations at radio wavelengths to search for this would be worthwhile .",
    "( 3 ) there is no evidence of dense circumstellar material .",
    "the three known novae with extended x - ray nebulae are all rather different from typical classical novae .",
    "gk  per had a planetary nebula before the outburst @xcite , while t  pyx and rs  oph are recurrent novae that have substantial pre - outburst circumstellar material with which the ejecta can interact .",
    "neither of these situations are the case for dk  lac .",
    "while we can not conclude that a substantial x - ray remnant is not present , it is much more likely that rekindled accretion is responsible for the observed x - rays .",
    "we have discovered x - ray emission from the old classical nova dk lac , 62 years after its only known outburst .",
    "the emission originates either in mass accretion onto the white dwarf , or in adiabatic shocks in the nova remnant .",
    "the present data do not allow us to discriminate between these two scenarios , although rekindled accretion is more likely .",
    "higher resolution x - ray imaging observations to resolve any extended x - ray emission and radio observations to search for emission resulting from circumstellar shocks would be of considerable interest . in either case",
