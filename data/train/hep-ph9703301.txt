    "the search and the study of higgs boson , the last missing member of the standard model family , are one of the most important tasks for the current and the future collider experiments at the energy frontier , such as the cern large electron - positron collider ( lep - ii ) , the next linear collider ( nlc ) , or the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the interaction of high energy photons at a photon - photon collider @xcite provides us with an unique opportunity to study the higgs boson .",
    "the higgs boson search at the photon - photon collider has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "especially , it has been shown that the search for the intermediate - mass higgs in the mass range @xmath0 through @xmath1 process is complementary to an @xmath2 linear collider @xcite or a hadron collider @xcite .    since two photons",
    "do not directly couple to the higgs boson but only do through loop diagrams of massive charged particles , any kind of massive charged particles contribute to the two - photon decay width of the higgs boson if the mass of the loop particle is originated by the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : cou ] shows a schematic diagram of the coupling of the higgs boson with two photons .",
    "it is notable that the contribution of a ultra - heavy particle in the two - photon decay width of the higgs boson does not been suppressed but does keep a sizable constant if its mass is due to the higgs condensation .    the deviation of the measured two - photon width from its predicted value in the standard model ( sm ) indicates some additional contributions from unknown particles , and thus it will be a signature of new physics beyond sm which can not be provided directly in the ordinary collider experiments .",
    "for example , the supersymmetric extensions of sm have additional charged particles such as scalar fermions , charged higgs and charginos . since the masses of these new particles partly originate from the higgs mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking , presence of these particles results in a shift of the two - photon decay amplitude of the higgs boson from its value of sm .",
    "in fact , the minimal extension of the standard model ( mssm ) predicts the ratio of the two - photon decay widths @xmath3 as much as 1.2 for the lightest higgs boson with the mass of 120 gev @xcite .",
    "the intermediate - mass higgs boson in sm mainly decays into a @xmath4 pair as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bra ] , and the daughter @xmath5-flavored hadrons will be easily identified due to their long lifetime , therefore the @xmath4 events are the best signals of the intermediate - mass higgs .",
    "the main background may be the continuum @xmath6 processes , however , the background events dominantly produced by initial photon collisions in @xmath7 angular momentum state can be suppressed by controlling the polarization of the colliding photon beams .",
    "simultaneously , this control of the beam polarizations causes to enhance the higgs signals which are only accessible to the @xmath8 collisions @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of the measurement of the two - photon decay width of higgs boson in this mass region have been studied using the monte carlo simulation by borden et al.@xcite .",
    "recently , several authors reported that the effect of qcd corrections to @xmath6 is large since the helicity suppression which affects the background @xmath9 events does not work due to a gluon emission .",
    "it could be a serious source of backgrounds for the intermediate - mass higgs , if some of the three - jet events from @xmath10 state mimic two - jet events @xcite .    in this work",
    "we simulate the measurement of the two - photon decay width of the higgs boson with the mass of 120 gev at a future photon - photon collider , including the effect of qcd corrections in the manner of jikia and tkabladze @xcite . to perform a realistic evaluation",

    "the impact of the measurement for new physics search is discussed with estimated precision .",
    "we first summarize on the photon beam production , beam collision and luminosity distribution generated by cain simulation program @xcite .",
    "as an example of a future linear collider , we adopt the parameters of japan linear collider ( jlc ) with x - band linear accelerators @xcite . in order to hit the mass pole of the higgs boson at 120 gev",
    ", the center - of - mass energy of the accelerator is tuned to be @xmath11 =  150  gev .",
    "we assume that the spent electrons are bent away by the sweeping magnet so that only scattered photons contribute to the luminosity .",
    "the energy of the laser photon is chosen to be 4.18 ev , which results in the maximum photon energy to be roughly 60 gev .",
    "parameters of the electron and laser beams are shown in table  [ tbl : par ] .",
    "we assume the complete polarizations for both of the electron and laser beams . the combination of the polarizations of the electron @xmath12 and the laser @xmath13 should be @xmath14 so that the generated photon spectrum peaks at its maximum energy . with this combination of the electron and the laser beam polarizations ,",
    "the obtained high energy photon beam is almost completely polarized around the peak energy .    in order to enhance the higgs production and to suppress the background events , the polarizations of the colliding photon beams",
    "should be arranged so that the @xmath15 collisions dominate .",
    "the realistic luminosity distribution of the photon - photon collision is provided by a monte carlo simulation program cain .",
    "cain is a comprehensive simulation program of the compton scatterings and of the beam - beam interactions between laser photons , electrons and positrons in linear colliders .",

    "it is seen from the figure that the higgs particle of 120 gev is produced at almost rest , and the low - energy background events like the resolved photon processes are hardly boosted to have completely different topologies from the signal events .",
    "for the intermediate - mass higgs , the cross section of the process @xmath1 near the mass pole can be described by the breit  wigner approximation , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the higgs mass , @xmath27 and @xmath28 the decay widths of the higgs boson into two photons and @xmath5 quark pair , @xmath29 the total decay width , @xmath30 and @xmath31 the initial photon helicities , respectively .",
