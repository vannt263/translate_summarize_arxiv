    "spectral libraries covering the hr diagram with medium to high resolution and large spectral range are essential tools in astronomy .",
    "we have identified two areas where there will be a special need of such libraries in the coming years : the automated parameterization of stellar spectra and the spectral synthesis of stellar populations of galaxies .",
    "new multi - object spectrographs on large telescopes , like giraffe on the vlt for example , will soon make it possible to observe hundreds of objects during the same exposure with an unprecedented resolution and spectral coverage .",
    "the challenge will be to extract the maximal information in a reasonable time .    for stars , medium to high resolution spectra",
    "are the basis for determining radial velocities , atmospheric parameters and eventually projected rotational velocities , v@xmath1 i. a new method , called tgmet , is emerging to make the parameterization of stellar spectra in terms of temperature , gravity and metallicity fast and automatic ( katz et al @xcite ) .",
    "it relies on the direct comparison of a target spectrum to a library of reference spectra with known atmospheric parameters ( soubiran et al @xcite ) .",
    "tgmet was originally dedicated to the measurement of f , g , k stars observed with elodie .",
    "the present paper , which continues the tgmet project , participates to release these limitations .",
    "the two major points addressed are ( 1 ) the extension of the reference library to all spectroscopic types and luminosity classes and its densification , and ( 2 ) to resample the spectra in wavelength ( i.e. remove the instrumental signature in elodie spectra and connect the echelle orders together ) in order to enable comparison of spectra from any origin .",
    "the tgmet project appeared to be also very useful for extragalactic studies where medium resolution libraries with large coverage in stellar parameters are needed .",
    "stellar libraries , calibrated in flux , are used to model composite spectra through stellar population synthesis ( eg . the pegase program , fioc & rocca - volmerange @xcite ) .",
    "an important issue is to disentangle the effects of age and metallicity and it has been demonstrated that the spectral resolution is a key factor ( worthey & ottviani @xcite , hereafter wo97 , vazdekis @xcite ) . to take profit of a resolution higher than about r=2000 both the internal kinematics and the characteristics of the stellar populations must be fitted simultaneously .",
    "making available an extended library of stellar spectra is the first step in this direction .",
    "current libraries are based on low resolution spectroscopy ( eg jacoby et al .",
    "@xcite , serote roos et al @xcite , pickles @xcite ) or they are restricted to a limited area of the hr diagram ( eg montes et al 2000 and soubiran et al @xcite for f , g , k stars ) . here",
    "we present an homogeneous dataset of spectra which fills the deficiency of such libraries .",
    "the sample of stars and associated data are presented in sect .",
    "3 & 4 describe the two phases of the data processing . in sect .",
    "5 we evaluate the quality of the archive . the access to the data through hypercat or at the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg are described in sect .",
    "the present sample was assembled by merging the stellar library of f , g , k stars ( soubiran et al @xcite ) serving as a basis for the tgmet program with additional spectra taken from other observing programs and from the near - to - line elodie archive ( http://www.obs-hp.fr ) .",
    "the spectra of the database correspond to stars which have been selected because they have published values of or , or reliable estimations of the absolute magnitude , deduced from hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "the main source of atmospheric parameters is the catalogue of determinations , 1996 and 2001 versions ( cayrel de strobel et al @xcite and @xcite ) but two other sources have been also used : carney et al ( @xcite ) and thvenin ( @xcite ) .",
    "effective temperatures were also taken in the lists published by blackwell & lynas - gray ( @xcite ) , alonso et al ( @xcite ) and alonso et al ( @xcite ) , or calculated from the colour indices v - k or b - y following the relations = f(colour , ) established by alonso et al @xcite and @xcite for dwarfs and giants respectively .",
    "each star had estimated by averaging the determinations found in the literature , giving a half weight to old references and strmgren photometry and a double weight to determined by blackwell & lynas - gray ( @xcite ) .",
    "as in the tgmet library , the parameters were then labelled according to their reliability which was estimated from the number of determinations and their standard deviation around the mean .",
    "the reliability scale runs from 0 to 4 , with the highest reliability 4 corresponding to uncertainties lower than 80 k in , and 0.06 dex in .",
    "these uncertainties can reach 115 k and 0.09 dex for reliability 3 , and 150 k and 0.11 dex for the reliability 2 .",
    "reliability 1 is attributed for parameters based on old determinations or photometry , or presenting large discrepancies between references .",
    "reliability 0 means that no reference on atmospheric parameters was found in the literature .",
    "the database is made of 908 spectra corresponding to 709 different stars which are shown in the plane ( @xmath2 , ) in fig 1 and in the plane ( @xmath2 , ) in fig .",
    "ranges from 3700 k to 13600 k , ranges from 0.03 to 5.86 and ranges from -2.8 to + 0.7 . in these two plots , new estimations of",
    "were used instead of those from the literature which are incomplete .",
    "these new estimations were obtained with the current version of tgmet which is still under development ( a paper presenting this new version is in preparation and a description is given in the electronic version of the archive ) .",
    "atmospheric parameters from the literature together with new estimations and measured line indices from the spectra presented here are given in table 1 , only available in electronic form ( see sect .",
    "6 ) .    more information on each star is available in the header of the fits spectra .",
    "it includes the absolute magnitude from hipparcos parallaxe when available .",
    "a scale of reliability was also established from the precision of the parallaxe and v magnitude from tycho-2 ( hg et al @xcite ) , 4 corresponding to parallaxes with a precision better than 10% . also available in the fits headers are the spectral types , ( v , b - v ) taken from the tycho-2 catalogue ( converted from the tycho-2 b@xmath3 and v@xmath3 ) and radial velocities usually measured at the telescope .",
    "the on - line cross - correlation technique was used to measure the radial velocity of strong - lined spectra , corresponding to moderate effective temperatures up to 6500 k but for hotter stars , the radial velocity was estimated using a least - squares deconvolution technique ( donati et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the database includes several stars with line profiles broadened by rotation , macroturbulence or binarity and a few stars with spectral peculiarities ( ap , am , emission line stars ... ) .",
    "these pecularities are indicated in the headers .",
    "elodie provides a spectral range of 390 - 680  nm recorded in a single exposure as 67 orders on a 1k ccd at a mean resolving power of 42000 .",
    "optimal extraction and wavelength calibration are automatically performed by the on - line reduction software tacos .",
    "complete information on elodie can be found in baranne et al ( @xcite ) and in the tacos user manual by queloz ( @xcite ) .",
    "the global efficiency of the instrument drops in the blue by a factor 5 at 440  nm for a solar - type star and by a factor 50 at 390  nm .",
    "hence we decided to limit the spectral range to @xmath0  nm .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio per pixel at 550  nm is 150 ( it is higher than 80 for more than 90% of the spectra ) .",
    "several spectra with a lower s / n , down to 35 , correspond generally to faint deficient stars which have been included in the database for a better sampling of the parameter space .    for the present purpose",
    ", the 908 spectra of the database were processed to provide 1d spectra rebinned in wavelength and calibrated in absolute fluxes . since the main goal of the archive was to construct a library of spectra representative of the various stellar types and an interpolated grid of spectra covering the parameters space , all the spectra",
    "were reduced to the rest - frame .",
    "the archive was prepared from the flat - fielded and order - extracted tacos spectra in two main steps .",
    "( 1 ) the orders were de - blazed , the spikes due to cosmic rays and telluric lines were masked , all the orders were connected in one spectrum , and the pseudo - continuum normalization was computed .",
    "( 2 ) the spectra were calibrated into `` physical '' flux , ie . above the atmosphere .",
    "this phase of the data processing takes the tacos spectra to deliver order - connected spectra with a constant wavelength step .",
    "both the instrumental and continuum fluxes are evaluated .",
    "the operations follow these steps :    * strengthen the spectra by dividing them by a de - blazing function * compute the pseudo - continuum normalization and analyze the `` shape '' of each order to determine a correction to the diffuse - light subtraction .",
    "* mask spikes and telluric lines . * convolve and rebin with two desired resolutions ( r=10000 and r=42000 ) to 1d spectra .",
    "the instrument , hard- and soft - ware , was mostly designed as a  velocimeter \" and hence the spectrophotometric quality was not optimized .",
    "the standard flat - field correction and order extraction was applied as described in baranne et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure alone would not permit to connect the spectra since the blaze is not accurately enough corrected , each order presents a residual `` curvature '' of about 2% .",
    "this effect is certainly due to diffuse light within the spectrograph which is imperfectly corrected by the tacos program , this is a common difficulty with echelle spectrographs .    to solve this problem we found no other possibility but to analyze this residual curvature on the actual spectra and correct it",
    "obviously , it is a risky approach since the spectrum itself is used to determine the correction . to minimize possible biases ,",
    "the residual curvature is modeled with only a few parameters : each order is represented by a second degree polynomial whose coefficients are not independent from order to order , but are themselves second degree polynomials of the order number .",
    "the total effect of the diffuse light is modeled by only 3 coefficients .",
    "practically , we divide the tacos spectrum by a de - blazing function determined from a tungsten - lamp spectrum ( internal flat - field ) and corrected using 3 metal - deficient stars ( because the blaze function appears to have slight systematic differences between internal flat - field and star ) .    to analyze the `` residual '' curvature of each order , we normalized the spectrum to its pseudo - continuum .",
    "the pseudo - continuum has been defined using one point in each order and then interpolated over the whole range of wavelengths with a @xmath4 degree spline .",
    "the pseudo - continuum level is determined by fitting a second degree polynomial to each order .",
    "the spectrum is weighted with a mask intended to avoid as much as possible the stellar lines , the fit is iterated after @xmath5 clipping and the remaining bias due to the weak stellar lines is statistically corrected .",
    "the latter correction is based of the analysis of the skewness of the distribution of residuals .",
    "the weighting mask is prepared from a previous iteration of the reduction of the whole archive : for each wavelength point it gives the probability to have a stellar line ( we started with no weight ) .",
    "though the visual inspection of the strengthened spectra appear satisfactory , the detection of possible biases have been a major concern and is presented in sect .",
    "5 .    after the correction for diffuse",
    "light was applied , the pseudo - continuum was re - computed .",
    "these normalized spectra are scoped for abundance studies , and determination of the atmospheric parameters with tgmet .",
    "all the information permitting calculation of the detected flux ( in electrons ) is kept in the form of a table extension attached to the fits image .",
    "the s / n of each pixel is also kept in a separate extension . the detailed description of the fits files is given with the electronic version of the tables and spectra .",
    "the spikes due cosmics and defective pixels and the telluric lines have been masked following the procedure developed by katz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the orders are normalized to their pseudo - continuum and resampled to a 1d spectrum with a wavelength step of 0.005  nm using spline interpolation ( the observations are over - sampled by about 20% ) .    to produce a version of the archive at the resolution 10000 ( i.e. 30 at @xmath6 = 550  nm ) the spectra are convolved by a gaussian function of fwhm = 0.054  nm , and rebinned with a step of 0.02  nm .",
    "the high resolution version has a constant resolution of r=42000 , ie .",
    "the resolution in nm changes with the wavelength . at variance , with the low resolution archive , the wavelength resolution , in nm , is constant throughout the spectra .",
    "note also that the convolution to produce the low resolution archive is done on the continuum - normalized spectra , which is not formally equivalent to convolving the flux calibrated spectra .",
    "however the induced difference is absolutely insignificant .",
    "the goal of the flux calibration is to determine the spectral energy distribution above the atmosphere ( the physical flux ) .",
    "the standard procedure to achieve the objective ( bessell @xcite ) consists in determining the instrumental response and correct for the atmospheric absorption by comparing the spectra to templates of known spectral energy distribution observed with the same setup between the target stars .",
    "since the primary scope of the observation was not spectrophotometry , no particular care was taken in interleaving template stars and some observations were done through heavy atmospheric absorption . therefore , the standard procedure can not be straightforwardly applied . before entering into the details of the procedure , we present hereafter its genesis .",
    "the relation between the instrumental flux deduced in the previous section and the physical flux ( the flux calibration relation ) primarily reflects the effects of ( 1 ) the instrumental response ( ie . the combined effect of the whole optics and ccd spectral sensitivity ) , ( 2 ) the absorption by a clear atmosphere and ( 3 ) an additional extinction due to an atmospheric haze .",
    "we started from the assumptions that ( 1 ) the instrumental response is stable or at least stable during each observing run , ( 2 ) the absorption by the clear atmosphere can be parameterized by the airmass and ( 3 ) that the effect of the haze can be parameterized by a _ color excess _ defined as the difference between the measured b - v color and the tycho-2 b - v color .",
    "a fit of these three functions of the wavelength using spectra of stars with known spectral energy distribution ( the details are presented below ) resulted in a photometric precision of about 5% when we considered the instrumental response stable over all observation runs .",
    "the shape of the three functions entering the calibration relation , and the analysis of the residuals lead to the suspicion that the correction of the atmospheric refraction provided by the spectrograph was not fully effective .",
    "this was diagnosed by ( 1 ) a stronger than expected wavelength dependence of the apparent atmospheric and haze transmissions and ( 2 ) a residual random `` curvature '' of the calibrated spectra that increases with airmass .",
    "our interpretation is that the `` clear atmosphere '' function corrects at the first order the effect of the refraction ( the star is centered on the fiber aperture by the auto - guider on the blue end of the atmospheric spectrum ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the centering of the star ( miss - guiding ) results in a `` color excess '' absorbed by the haze function , but depending on the value of the miss - centering and of the seeing a residual curvature is left .",
    "it was unfortunately not possible to parameterize this effect since it depends on a random and unknown miss - centering and on the seeing which is not always recorded in the observing logs .",
    "an alternative would have been to use an additional color excess to constrain the curvature , but no such independent measurement is available for the stars of our archive .    adding a quadratic airmass term , another function of color excess and allowing for variation of the instrumental response between the different observing runs led to a photometric quality of about 3% which",
    "was then improved to 2% after corrections based on internal comparisons .",
    "we did not find hints for other effect on the photometric quality , such as the effect of the stress on the optical fiber or positioning of the color correction filter that may change the instrumental response .",
    "we will now describe the different steps of the calibrations : ( 1 ) _ primary _ calibration based on the comparison with low spectral resolution flux templates ( 2 ) _ secondary _ calibration based on internal comparison and ( 3 ) correction of the instrumental response using template spectra with a better spectral resolution than for the primary calibration .",
    "as already explained , the observations were not originally scoped for photometry and no flux templates were explicitly observed .",
    "however , since the archive contains bright stars , many of them are in common with other libraries or datasets .",
    "the largest intersection is with the collection of low resolution spectra presented in burnashev ( @xcite , cds iii/126 ) .",
    "the spectral resolution is about r=100 ( fwhm = 5 - 6  nm ) , and the observations are from different sources which were homogenized to a common scale .",
    "the observations were done with photo - electric spectro - photometers mostly a the crimean observatory , and are not corrected from the interstellar extinction .",
    "some stars in our archive are in common with other datasets with a better spectral resolution , but not in a number sufficient to fit the calibration relation .",
    "for this reason we choose to first calibrate the archive with this dataset .",
    "it was entered in the hypercat fits archive ( hfa ) with the identification l1985burn .",
    "the first step was to assess the photometric quality of these templates .",
    "the b and v magnitudes were integrated on the spectra and compared with the measurements converted from the tycho-2 catalogue .",
    "we found a rms difference on b - v of 0.05 .",
    "the difference with the tycho-2 color is used for affecting a weight to each of these template observations .",
    "the determination of the calibration relation is done after the instrumental spectra from our archive are convolved to the resolution of l1985burn .",
    "the original reference does not precisely document this resolution which varies with the origin of the observations , and we had to determine it .",
    "a first guess was obtained by fitting gaussians on strong balmer lines and this was fine - tuned afterwards to minimize the residuals on the strong lines .",
    "it was necessary to adopt slightly different resolutions for the blue and red parts of the spectra .",
    "the model adopted for the primary calibration relation is :    @xmath7    @xmath8 is the _ physical _ flux reduced above the atmosphere .",
    "the two right - hand terms @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the instrumental response .",
    "the first is stable over all the observing runs while the second contains the variable part .",
    "we separated the two terms because the second could not be determined for all the observing runs : when the number of calibrated observations was less than 10 the second term was not computed and assumed to be 0 .",
    "the run - dependent instrumental response was determined for 9 runs out of 21 , and a secondary calibration ( next sub - section ) was also obtained .",
    "the next two terms depend on the airmass ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the first of them accounts for the clear atmosphere absorption and mean aperture effect due to the atmospheric extinction .",
    "the second partly corrects the `` curvature '' of the spectrum due to the refraction ( the length of the atmospheric spectra is proportional to @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the zenithal distance ) .",
    "the two last terms are parameterized by a b - v color excess , defined as the difference between b - v determined on our spectra and the tycho-2 b - v .",
    "it is not possible to measure directly the b magnitude on our spectra since the standard b band extend farther blue - ward than their limit .",
    "hence it was necessary to `` calibrate '' a different color , by fitting a color equation as it is usually done for converting between photometric systems .",
    "this procedure has the disadvantage that it formally depends on the actual spectral energy distribution of the star and hence may introduce a bias linked to the atmospheric parameters of the stars .",
    "however , such effect may be estimated from the residuals of the fit of the color equation , and for small color terms ( ie . if our internal b is close to the johnson b ) it can be neglected .    since this conversion was necessary , we used this opportunity to define 2 b bands ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 , converted to johnson scale as @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) giving two estimates of the color excess",
    ". the difference between these two estimates gives an approximate measure of the residual curvature of the spectra due to the atmospheric dispersion .",
    "@xmath18    the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands were respectively defined as the integral of the flux distribution between @xmath19  nm and @xmath20  nm .",
    "the color equation was determined with the 2238 spectra of l1985burn , using ordinary least squares and iterative rejection of outliers , as :    @xmath21    the rms residuals from these fits are about 0.025 mag .",
    "the magnitudes and colors are practically measured on the instrumental spectra ( not physical flux ) , and hence the measured excess is biased due to the instrumental response and depends on the airmass . though it does not change the fit to eq . 1 , in order to have independent functions we corrected the excess from the effect of instrumental response and atmospheric extinction using an _ a posteriori _ fit between corrected and un - corrected excess .",
    "the flux calibration relation was fitted on 369 spectra of stars in common between our archive and l1985burn .",
    "the different functions of the wavelength were finally smoothed by fitting polynomials in order to erase the residual effects of resolution miss - matching which results in spurious irregularities in these functions ( in particular around @xmath22 and g - band ) .",
    "the primary calibration allowed us to determine the run - dependent response for only half the runs ( but more than half the spectra since the number of stars is not equal in each run ) . by inter - comparing spectra of the same stars for which several observations were available it is possible to make a _ secondary _ calibration , using the runs where the run - dependent response was available as `` template '' .",
    "this exercise allowed us to detect a significant change in the response of the instrument between the observations prior to 1995 and those done after .",
    "this change seems to be due to a modification of the differential refraction corrector at the end of year 1994 .",
    "in addition , for two other runs the number of inter - comparisons was large enough to adopt a reliable run - dependent corrections . the run - dependent correction account for a rms photometric effect of about 0.025 mag . for 9 runs",
    "no such correction is available at present .      up to this point the flux calibration",
    "can be assumed to properly correct the effect of atmospheric absorption and to correct at the best the aperture effect due to the differential refraction .",
    "however , the instrumental response was evaluated using low - resolution spectra and had furthermore to be smoothed . at variance with the other functions which presumably vary smoothly with wavelength",
    ", the instrumental response may be more chaotic .",
    "therefore , the last step of the calibration process consists in using higher spectral resolution ( @xmath23 ) to correct the instrumental response .",
    "these reference spectra are taken from the following dataset , referenced by their hfa identification :    * l96111kp1 and l96111kp2 . the elodie database contains 191 spectra of 144 stars from the jones library ( leitherer et al .",
    "1998 ) ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this library cover two narrow wavelength ranges , one in the blue part below @xmath25  nm the other between @xmath26  nm .",
    "this is the highest resolution reference for stellar spectra yet available for comparison .",
    "this library is not corrected for the aperture effect due to differential refraction and is not of photometric quality . after re - calibrating the `` color '' of this spectra ( defining special color - band as we did for our spectra for the primary calibration ) , the mean agreement with our spectra is satisfactory . *",
    "the elodie database has 8 spectra of 6 stars in common with serote ross et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "these spectra are from cfh ( r=650 ) and ohp ( r=4000 ) observations .",
    "they intersect the red half of our spectral range .",
    "the comparison with the l1996sero spectra , after the spectral resolutions are matched by convolving our spectra with a gaussian , show pixel - to - pixel variations of the order of 2% ( rms ) and low - frequency variations of typically 5% .",
    "these figures are consistent with the comparison performed by serote ross et al .",
    "( @xcite ) with the silva & cornell ( @xcite ) library .",
    "* l1984jaco .",
    "we have 2 spectra for 2 stars ( hd094028 & hd028099 ) in common with the jacoby library ( r=1200 ) which cover the full wavelength range .",
    "the two spectra compared with l1984jaco reveal a significant gradient ( the difference over the whole range of wavelength are respectively 29% and 14% for the first and second spectrum ) and a pixel - to - pixel variation of 0.5% rms .",
    "the b - v color integrated from the l1984jaco spectra disagrees with the tycho-2 value in amounts that explain the differences with our spectra . *",
    "we have 13 spectra of 7 stars from the dataset of kiehling ( 1987 ) ( r=800 ) . *",
    "we have 17 spectra from 14 stars in common with danks & dennefeld ( @xcite ) ( r=1500 ) . the red half of our wavelength range intersects with l1994dank .",
    "* l1983gunn .",
    "the gunn & stryker ( @xcite ) library ( r=500 ) counts 5 stars in common with our archive . *",
    "finally we compared our 7 solar spectra with the _ solar flux atlas _ ( kurucz et al .",
    "@xcite ) ( r=500000 , also stored in hfa with r=10000 ) .",
    "we made all the individual comparisons between our spectra , convolved by a gaussian to match the resolution , and these references . because the broad - band variations are probably due either to random photometric errors in our archive ( certainly not systematic ) , correction of the interstellar extinction",
    "( it was not always possible to de - correct the templates ) or errors in the templates , we subtracted a low - degree polynomial ( 1 to 3 depending for which dataset ) to these comparisons .",
    "the individual comparisons ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) were then combined and produced a mean residual convolved to a resolution of 2 nm fwhm ( each order of the original spectrum covers about 4 nm and no correction of the instrumental response at a lower scale is desired ) .",
    "this was used to correct the instrumental response .",
    "we also made an unsuccessful attempt to compare our archive with the pickles ( @xcite ) library ( l1998pick ) : all the spectra were compared to the nearest ( in the - - space ) template in l1998pick .",
    "but the mapping of the parameters space in l1998pick is not dense enough and the residuals are too affected by the distance in the parameter space to permit a useful analysis .",
    "we did not attempt to interpolate the spectra within the pickles library .",
    "to check the reliability of our data and reduction we used the following tests : ( 1 ) analyze the inter - comparison of repeated observations and analyze internal consistency , ( 2 ) compare fully reduced spectra with other libraries and ( 3 ) compare lick indices for stars with published measurements .",
    "there are a priori three possible sources of discrepancy to search : ( 1 ) errors on the instrumental response and/or correction of atmospheric extinction are likely to result in low and intermediate spatial frequencies variations .",
    "( 2 ) inaccurate subtraction of the diffuse light may be diagnosed as significant mismatch of the strongest lines and ( 3 ) inaccurate correction for the blaze will lead to oscillations with a one - order period .",
    "there are in total 358 repeated observations for 104 stars in the archive . after giving a double weight to the observations in the runs for which the run - dependent response was computed from primary calibration and half weight to the observations done with an airmass larger than 1.5 (",
    "their photometric quality is lower because of the differential refraction ) , we find a global rms dispersion for the pairwise comparison of about 3.5% , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . without weighting ,",
    "the dispersion is 4% and the difference was a hint for the lowest photometric quality of high airmass observations , hence leading to suspicion about the refraction corrector .",
    "since it is a pairwise comparison , the mean photometric error on individual observations is : @xmath27 .",
    "( note that this error does not account for possible systematic errors affecting uniformly the whole archive , it will be discussed in sect .",
    "5.2 & 5.3 ) .",
    "most of the photometric errors lie in residual `` curvature '' of the spectra . after subtracting a third degree polynomial to each pairwyse comparison ,",
    "the rms dispersion becomes 0.7% , corresponding to a mean photometric precision of 0.5% , in full agreement with the mean s / n ratio .",
    "no hint for a modulation at the scale of one order of the echelle spectra is found .",
    "random errors on the strengthening of the spectra are probably in average smaller than 0.5% because otherwise they would increase the dispersion of the pairwyse internal comparison ( after the third degree polynomial is subtracted ) .",
    "the new version of the tgmet program that will be described in a separate paper allowed us to generate interpolated spectra for a given position in the space .",
    "the difference between the spectra in the archive and these modeled spectra can potentially uncover possible random errors on the strengthening .",
    "therefore we computed and averaged the differences to the modeled spectra for all the spectra in the archive .",
    "the mean residuals were searched for a modulation at the scale of one order , either in the spectrum or in its fourier transform .",
    "we did not detect any signal .",
    "we made simulations that told that a 0.5% ( rms ) modulation would probably have been detected , but a 0.2% modulation would not .",
    "the comparisons between our physically calibrated spectra and other libraries were used in the previous section to compute the correction to the instrumental response .",
    "the goal was to determine the variation of the response at the scale of 1 to 5 nm that was not constrained by the primary calibration .",
    "therefore , by construction , the mean external comparison is flat ( ie .",
    "may only varies smoothly with the wavelength ) .",
    "a careful analysis of the individual comparison could assess the level of stability of the instrumental response .",
    "the patterns in the correction to the instrumental response were consistently found in the different individual comparisons and no significant effect was found after this correction was applied .",
    "however , the scarcity of the available comparisons did not allow us to measure a photometric precision .",
    "the lick indices ( see eg .",

    "the systematic shifts are always smaller than the dispersion except for ca4455 ( where it is equal ) and for fe4383 the shift may be significant .",
    "however , we can not attribute this to an error in our measurements and in particular we note that the shift for fe4383 is similar to the one found by wo97 when they compared the original lick measurements with the spectra of the jones library ( note that our flux calibration is not fully independent from the jones library since this latter was used among others to correct the instrumental response ) .",
