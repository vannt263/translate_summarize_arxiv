    "thanks to neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , we currently have convincing evidence that neutrinos have tiny masses and mix with each other through the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "the recent global analysis of neutrino oscillation data yields the following best - fit values and @xmath3 errors @xcite : @xmath4 which indicate a bi - large mixing pattern and leave open three possibilities for the neutrino mass spectrum : the normal hierarchy ( @xmath5 ) , inverted hierarchy ( @xmath6 ) and quasi - degenerate ( @xmath7 ) spectra .",
    "the individual neutrino masses as well as the correct mass spectrum remain unclear .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "some extensions of the standard model ( sm ) to accommodate the tiny neutrino masses have been proposed .",
    "for instance , in the seesaw mechanisms @xcite , new heavy particles are introduced to generate neutrino masses suppressed by mass scales of the heavy particles , while such small neutrino masses can radiatively be induced from a loop diagram @xcite , too . concerning the mixing , many constant - number - parametrizations ( e.g. , the democratic @xcite , bi - maximal @xcite and tri - bimaximal @xcite mixings )",
    "have been invented and a lot of efforts have been devoted to deriving them from a flavor symmetry .",
    "one of the most attractive features of these parametrizations is that they do not depend on the neutrino masses , so that no parameter tuning is required to obtain the desired mixing pattern .",
    "however , at the same time , it appears that this feature have made the mystery of the neutrino mass spectrum fade into the background .",
    "theoretical studies on the mass spectrum seem subtle in comparison with those on the mixing : we still do not have any plausible model which can explain why only @xmath8 stands alone whereas @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be nearly degenerate in the hierarchical mass spectra , or why they are so degenerate in the quasi - degenerate spectrum .    in this letter , we focus on the hierarchical mass spectra and explore a possibility that a mass generation mechanism for the lighter neutrino(s ) is different from that for the heavier ones(one ) . particularly , we consider the following two specific scenarios :    * scenario - a + the mass ordering is inverted . at the tree level , @xmath11 are non - zero and completely degenerate , while @xmath8 is vanishing . a small @xmath8 and mass splitting between @xmath9 and @xmath10 arise from radiative corrections .",
    "* scenario - b + the mass ordering is normal .",
    "only @xmath8 is non - zero at the tree level . @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath10 become non - zero after taking radiative corrections into account .    to this end",
    ", we combine the type - i seesaw @xcite and inert doublet @xcite mechanisms .",
    "the idea was originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to simultaneously explain the relic abundance of dark matter , constrains from leptonic processes and the baryon asymmetry of the universe as well as the neutrino oscillation data . here",
    "we take a closer look at the neutrino masses and try to find possible implications for the mixing angles ; especially we are interested in correlations with the smallest mixing angle @xmath2 .",
    "similar studies are done in refs .",
    "@xcite with a different particle content and/or setup .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we show a basic framework of our scheme and apply it to scenario - a .",
    "we investigate scenario - b in sec .",
    "iii and summarize our discussion in sec .",
    "we show a simple realization of the mass matrix eq .",
    "( [ eq : bmn ] ) .",
    "in addition to the @xmath12 symmetry , we introduce @xmath13-flavor and @xmath14-auxiliary symmetries with gauge singlet flavon fields @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the particle content and charged assignments",
    "are summarized in table [ tab : sb ] , and the tensor products of @xmath13 are given by @xcite @xmath18 because of the symmetries , the lagrangian of the neutrino sector is written as @xmath19 where we have written down only the leading terms and @xmath20 denotes a typical energy scale of the @xmath13 flavor symmetry .",
    "if we demand the vev alignment : @xmath21 , the tree - level and one - loop neutrino mass matrices turn out to be @xmath22 respectively , where vevs of the flavons and @xmath20 are included in the yukawa couplings .",
    "@xmath23 can be diagonalized by the @xmath24 rotation in the @xmath25 plane and then , we obtain the neutrino mass matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bmn ] ) . furthermore , by adding extra higgs doublets to the charged lepton sector , we can easily derive a diagonal charged lepton mass matrix @xcite .",
