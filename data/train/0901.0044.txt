    "first , in section  [ sec : hyp ] , the notions of fractional coverings and packings using hypergraphs , which provide a useful language for the information inequalities we present , are developed . in section  [ sec : submod ] , we present the main technical result of this paper , which is a new inequality for submodular set functions . section  [ sec : main ] presents the main entropy inequality of this paper , which strengthens proposition i , and gives a very simple proof as a corollary of the general result for submodular functions .",
    "this entropy inequality is developed in two forms , which we call the strong fractional form and the strong degree form ; proposition i may then be thought of as the weak degree form .",
    "a different manifestation of the upper bound in this weak degree form of the inequality was recently proved ( in a more involved manner ) by friedgut @xcite ; the relationship with his result is also further discussed in section  [ sec : main ] using the preliminary concepts developed in section  [ sec : hyp ] .",

    "kahn first derived a tight bound on the ( logarithm of the ) number of independent sets in a regular bipartite graph . in section  [ sec : count ] , we build on kahn s work to obtain a bound on number of independent sets in an arbitrary graph .",
    "we also generalize this to counting graph homomorphisms , with applications to graph coloring and zero - error source - channel codes .",
    "the applications of entropy inequalities to counting typically involves discrete random variables , but the inequalities also have applications when applied to continuous random variables . in section  [ sec : det ] , we develop such an application by proving a new family of determinantal inequalities that provide generalizations of the classical determinantal inequalities of hadamard , szasz and fischer .",
    "having presented two applications of our main inequalities , we move on to studying the structure of the inequalities more closely . in section",
    "[ sec : dual ] , we present a duality between our upper and lower bounds that generalizes a theorem of fujishige @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show that the collection of upper bounds on @xmath32})$ ] for all collections @xmath7 is equivalent to the collection of lower bounds .",
    "there we also discuss interpretations of the inequality relating to sensor networks and erasure entropy , and generalize the monotonicity property for special collections of subsets discovered by han @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : epi ] presents some new entropy power inequalities for joint distributions , and points out an intriguing analogy between them and the recent subset sum entropy power inequalities of madiman and barron @xcite . in section  [ sec : d ] , we prove inequalities for relative entropy between joint distributions .",
    "interpretations of the relative entropy inequality through hypothesis testing and concentration of measure are also given there .",
    "in section  [ sec : hist ] , we note that weaker versions of our main inequality for submodular functions follow from results developed in various communities ( economics , computer science , physics ) ; this history and the consequent connections do not seem to be well known or much tapped in information theory . finally in section  [",

    "this result has a long history , and has rarely been explicitly stated in the literature although aspects of it have been rediscovered on multiple occasions in various fields .",
    "first we describe how it is implicit in the classical theory of cooperative games .    in cooperative game theory , a set function @xmath249 } \\to { { \\mathbb r}_{+}}$ ]",
    "is called a value function ; it can be thought of as describing the payoff that can be obtained by arbitrary coalitions of @xmath31 players , and it is canonical to take @xmath83 .",
    "different assumptions on the value function @xmath3 correspond to different kinds of games .",
    "for instance , a _",
    "balanced game _ is one for which the value function is fractionally superadditive , i.e. , [ bal - pty ] f([n ] ) _",
    "s(s)f(s ) holds for every fractional partition @xmath40 .",
    "if the value function @xmath3 is supermodular , the corresponding game is said to be a _",
    "convex game_.    one solution concept for cooperative games is the core , a subset of euclidean space representing possible allocations of the payoff to players .",
    "( we do not bother to define it here ; it suffices for our brief remarks here to know that such a notion exists . )",
    "the fundamental bondareva - shapley theorem @xcite states that the game with transferable utility associated with the value function @xmath3 has a non - empty core if and only if it is balanced .",
    "separately , it is known from even earlier work of kelley @xcite ( see also shapley @xcite who rediscovered it in the language of games ) that a convex game has a non - empty core",
    ". putting these together , one sees that a convex game must be balanced .",
    "this yields a statement very similar to that of corollary ix .",
    "much more recently , yet another related approach to the relationship between submodularity and fractional subadditivity has come from the theory of combinatorial auctions .",
    "lehmann , lehmann and nisan @xcite showed that every submodular function is `` xos '' ( terminology that again we do not bother to explain here ) .",
    "feige @xcite showed that xos and fractionally subadditive are identical .",
    "we refer the reader to the mentioned papers for definitions and details .    to summarize , the literature from cooperative game theory and combinatorial auction theory imply corollary ix .",
    "while we had expected direct proofs of corollary ix to exist in the literature , we had initially been unable to find a reference .",
    "after the first version of this paper was written and presented at various venues , we were informed by alan sokal that it has indeed been explicitly stated and proved in the french statistical physics literature by moulin ollagnier and pinchon @xcite ( see also van enter , fernndez and sokal @xcite , where it is applied to entropy in a statistical physics context ) .",
    "the above discussion is also related to the theory of polymatroids .",
    "a nondecreasing and submodular set function @xmath249 } \\to { { \\mathbb r}_{+}}$ ] with @xmath250 is sometimes called a @xmath48-function .",
    "this class of functions has been intensely studied ever since the pioneering work of edmonds @xcite , who used them to define polymatroids .",
    "note that the nondecreasing property ( i.e. , @xmath251 whenever @xmath252 $ ] ) implies that @xmath3 is non - negative .",
    "it is pertinent to note that the extra properties inherent in polymatroid theory are not required for corollary ix and theorem i ( for instance , a non - negativity requirement for @xmath3 would rule out an application to the differential entropy ) ; so theorem i is really just a basic fact about submodular functions .",
    "the inequalities presented in this note are contributions to a large body of work on the structural properties of the entropy function for joint distributions .",
    "while the origins of such work clearly lie in shannon s foundational paper , let us again mention ( see also the discussion after theorem i ) that the important observation of submodularity of the joint entropy function goes back at least to fujishige @xcite .",
    "there have also been interesting new developments in the last few years , namely the discovery of the so - called `` non - shannon inequalities '' .",
    "motivated by the goal of characterizing the possible joint entropy set functions @xmath253 for the discrete entropy as the underlying joint distribution is varied arbitrarily , zhang and yeung @xcite revealed a fascinating phenomenon : if one thinks of each such @xmath254 ( corresponding to any joint distribution on @xmath31 copies of a discrete alphabet ) as being a vector of dimension @xmath255 , then the set of vectors one obtains in this manner is a strict subset of the set of vectors corresponding to polymatroidal functions for any @xmath256 .",
    "the constraints on joint entropy that are not automatic consequences of a polymatroid property were termed `` non - shannon inequalities '' in @xcite .",
    "for more recent developments on this subject , one may consult ibinson , linden and winter @xcite , mat@xmath257 @xcite , or dougherty , freiling and zeger @xcite .    in the context of these works",
    ", it is pertinent to note that all of the inequalities in this paper are shannon inequalities , in the sense that they follow from submodularity of an entropy function .",
    "indeed , our study was based on the set function @xmath253 , from consideration of which our main entropy inequality ( theorem i ) was derived",
    ". however , since we now know from the mentioned literature that entropy satisfies additional constraints beyond submodularity , a natural question arises .",
    "if it is true that the set function @xmath258 is itself submodular , so that theorem i then follows by an application of corollary ix to @xmath259 rather than an application of theorem i to @xmath254 , then we would have a tighter outer bound on the space of joint entropy set functions .",
    "the following counterexample shows that this is not the case .",
    "* proposition iii : * the set function @xmath260 is not submodular .",
    "we construct a counterexample with @xmath261 random variables .",
    "consider the sets @xmath262 and @xmath263",
    ". then @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "if @xmath259 is submodular , then since @xmath18 contains the first element , h(x_s)+h(x_t|x_<t ) h(x_st ) + h(x_st|x_<(st ) ) , which in our case becomes [ ex - sm ]    h(x_\\{1,3 } ) & + h(x_\\{3,4}|x_\\{1,2 } ) + & h(x_\\{1,3,4 } ) + h(x_\\{3}|x_\\{1,2 } ) .    by the chain rule , h(x_\\{1,3,4})=h(x_\\{1,3})+h(x_4|x_\\{1,3 } ) , and h(x_\\{3,4}|x_\\{1,2 } ) = h(x_4|x_\\{1,2,3 } ) + h(x_3|x_\\{1,2 } ) , so that reduces to    h(&x_\\{1,3 } ) + h(x_4|x_\\{1,2,3 } ) + h(x_3|x_\\{1,2 } ) + & h(x_\\{1,3 } ) + h(x_4|x_\\{1,3 } ) + h(x_3|x_\\{1,2 } ) ,    and thence simply to @xmath266 . however , this is in general not true since conditioning reduces entropy , and thus the hypothesis of submodularity is falsified .",
    "note , however , that such a counterexample is only possible when @xmath267 is strictly smaller than the index set @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the relationship between the inequalities for discrete and continuous entropy in this paper is worth noting .",
    "observe that a slightly more general class of inequalities holds for discrete entropy as compared to differential entropy ( for instance , only fractional partitions are allowed in the differential entropy context in theorem i ) ; however , this is not surprising and indeed follows from the equivalences explored by chan @xcite .",
    "the structural properties of entropy discussed in this work are not just of abstract interest .",
    "some applications , to determinant inequalities and counting problems , have already been mentioned in earlier sections .",
    "the inequalities discussed also have close connections with several classical multiuser information theoretic problems , including the slepian - wolf data compression problem and the multiple access channel .",
    "in particular , for the slepian - wolf problem where data from @xmath31 sources is to be losslessly compressed in a distributed fashion , it is the set function @xmath268 rather than @xmath95 that plays the key role .",
    "consequently , the _ lower _ bound in theorem i has a crucial significance : it is equivalent to the existence of a rate point whose sum rate is the same as the rate achievable for non - distributed compression ( namely @xmath32})$ ] ) , and is one way of showing that no extra cost is paid in terms of asymptotic rate for the distributed nature of the task .",
    "these connections merit a separate and more detailed exploration , and are discussed along with several other applications of cooperative game theory to multiuser problems in @xcite .",
    "chain rules for entropy and relative entropy have played an important role in information theory since their recognition by shannon .",
    "here we have presented several inequalities for information in joint distributions that go beyond the chain rules but can also be thought of as deeper consequences of them .",
    "while these relate the information in projections of a random vector onto different subspaces , more general inequalities can be formulated that apply to a rich class of functions beyond projections ( such as the sum ) , and these are described along with applications to additive combinatorics and matrix analysis in the follow - up works @xcite .",
    "we anticipate further extensions and applications of these inequalities in the future . .",
