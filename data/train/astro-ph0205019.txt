    "a large number of brown dwarfs ( bds ) have been discovered in the last few years , both within stellar clusters and among field stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is now well established that bds do not hide a significant amount of baryonic dark matter , at least in our galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is flat or decreasing toward sub  stellar masses .",
    "even if the total mass of bds is not dynamically important , their abundance relative to hydrogen burning stars is so large that their existence can not be overlooked in the context of a theory of star formation . according to cluster and field imfs extended to sub ",
    "stellar masses , there are almost as many bds as regular stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "bds may be relevant also for understanding the formation of planets , because their mass is intermediate between that of hydrogen burning stars ( @xmath0@xmath1  m@xmath2 ) and that of planets ( @xmath3@xmath4  m@xmath2 , using the deuterium burning limit to separate planets from bds ) .",
    "surprisingly , very little theoretical research has addressed the problem of the formation of bds .",
    "most theoretical research on bds is concerned with modeling the structure and evolution of sub ",
    "stellar objects and their atmospheres , in order to derive their observational properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the classical jeans mass @xcite at the mean density and temperature of a typical star ",
    "forming cloud is several solar masses .",
    "based on the usual assumption that the jeans mass is an approximate estimate of the lower limit to the stellar mass @xcite , the formation of bds is an unsolved problem .",
    "recent observational results have shown that the mass distribution of prestellar condensations is indistinguishable from the stellar imf , both in the functional shape and in the range of masses , including bd mass cores @xcite .",
    "the problem of the formation of bds in molecular clouds with a jeans mass much larger than the mass of bds is thus unlikely to be solved by relying on a significant mass difference between a single collapsing core and its final star .",
    "@xcite stressed the importance of bds for testing star formation theories .",
    "he proposed that bds are more abundant in ultra - cold regions in the inner disk of m31 or in spiral  arm dust lanes than in normal star  forming clouds .",
    "he assumed that the smallest stellar mass is of the order of the thermal jeans mass and therefore the bd abundance should increase with decreasing gas temperature or increasing pressure .",
    "his argument is consistent with the present work , where we focus on more typical regions of star formation .",
    "@xcite proposed that bds are the leftover of a prematurely interrupted accretion process .",
    "their model assumes that stars are born as multiple systems of small `` embryos '' sharing a common reservoir of accreting gas .",
    "the accretion process of one of them is `` aborted '' when it is ejected by gravitational interaction with a pair of companions .",
    "one problem with this model is that protostellar disks are frequently found around bds @xcite .",
    "other problems posed by observational data are discussed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite have interpreted the results of a numerical simulation as evidence in favor of the @xcite model .",
    "they simulated the collapse of a 50  m@xmath2 isothermal gas cloud , with an initial random velocity field and uniform density , using a smooth particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) code .",
    "they found that bds are formed mainly as members of multiple systems by the gravitational fragmentation of a common protostellar disk . in their simulation , the initial velocity field is not obtained as the solution of the fluid equations self  consistently with the density field .",
    "it is instead generated artificially by imposing a power spectrum consistent with larson s velocity - size correlation @xcite , while the initial density is uniform .",
    "as the turbulence is not externally driven , it decays while the cloud collapses and there is no time for the flow to rearrange as a realistic supersonic turbulent flow independent of the initial conditions .",
    "another problem is the absence of a magnetic field , which affects significantly the fragmentation process as the magnetic field may modify the shock jump conditions and the angular momentum transport .    given the numerical limitations in the simulation by @xcite , it is possible that turbulent fragmentation has been overlooked as the origin of collapsing cores of bd mass . in the present work",
    "we investigate the possibility that bds are the direct consequence of turbulent fragmentation , in the sense that they are assembled by the turbulent flow as gravitationally unstable objects .",
    "we first compute the upper limit to the bd abundance in   2 , based on the probability density function ( pdf ) of gas density in supersonic turbulence . in ",
    "3 we compute the actual bd abundance , according to our analytical model of the stellar imf , and in ",
    "4 we show that numerical simulations of supersonic magneto  hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence provide support for our analytical model .",
    "results are summarized and conclusions drawn in   5 .",
    "the gas density and velocity fields in star  forming clouds are highly non  linear due to the presence of supersonic turbulence .",
    "the kinetic energy of turbulence is typically 100 times larger than the gas thermal energy on the scale of a few pc ( the typical rms mach number is of the order of 10 ) and the gas is roughly isothermal , so that very large compressions due to a complex network of interacting shocks can not be avoided . under such conditions",
    "the concept of gravitational instability , based on a comparison between gravitational and thermal energies alone in a system with mild perturbations , does not apply .",
    "dense cores of any size can be formed in the turbulent flow , independent of the jeans mass .",
    "those cores that are massive and dense enough ( larger than their own jeans mass ) collapse into protostars , while smaller subcritical ones re - expand into the turbulent flow .",
    "this is a process that we call _ turbulent fragmentation _ , to stress the point that stars and bds , formed in supersonically turbulent clouds , are not primarily the result of gravitational fragmentation .",
    "nevertheless , the idea of a critical mass for gravitational collapse is often applied to star forming clouds .",
    "the critical mass is defined as the jeans or the bonnor ",
    "ebert mass @xcite computed with the average density , temperature and pressure .",
    "the effect of the kinetic energy of turbulence is modeled as an external pressure , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the gas density and @xmath7 is the rms velocity of the turbulence .",
    "@xcite , for example , has proposed that the minimum stellar mass is of the order of this bonnor  ebert mass . the minimum stellar mass in typical star ",
    "forming clouds is then several  m@xmath2 , which contradicts the relatively large abundance of bds .",
    "dense cores formed by the turbulent flow need to be larger than their thermal critical mass to collapse ( neglecting the magnetic field ) .",
    "therefore , a necessary condition for the formation of bds by supersonic turbulence is the existence of a finite mass fraction , in the turbulent flow , with density at least as high as the critical one for the collapse of a bd mass core . as an estimate of the critical mass we use the bonnor ",
    "ebert mass , instead of the classical jeans mass , because the cores assembled by the turbulent flow are non  linear density enhancements bounded by the shock ram pressure , rather than linear density perturbations as in jeans assumption .",
    "the mass , @xmath8 , of the critical bonnor ",
    "ebert isothermal sphere is @xcite : @xmath9 we have verified numerically that this expression is a good estimate of the critical mass , both in simple geometries and in turbulence simulations including selfgravity .",
    "we want to estimate the mass fraction with density at least as high as the critical one for the collapse of a bd mass core . using the value @xmath10",
    "m@xmath2 for the largest bd mass , the condition @xmath11",
    "m@xmath2 corresponds to @xmath12  @xmath13 , using equation ( [ mj0 ] ) .",
    "the fraction of the total mass of the system that can form bds is given by the probability that @xmath14 .",
    "this is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the probability density function ( pdf ) of the gas density @xmath17 .",
    "this probability can be interpreted as a fractional volume and therefore the mass fraction available for the formation of bds is : @xmath18 it is important to stress that @xmath19 is _ not _ the bd mass fraction , but only the mass fraction of the gas that _ could _",
    "end up in bds , or the upper limit for the bd mass fraction ( assuming bds are due only to turbulent fragmentation ) .",
    "most likely the star formation process is rather inefficient for bds as it is for hydrogen burning stars , and so the actual fractional mass in bds may be significantly smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "one of the most important universal properties of turbulent fragmentation is that the pdf of gas density is log ",
    "normal for an isothermal gas , so that @xmath21dn , \\label{pdf1}\\ ] ] for the case of @xmath22 .",
    "the average value of the logarithm of density , @xmath23 , is determined by the standard deviation @xmath24 of the logarithm of density ( a property of the log ",
    "normal , here used again for the case @xmath22 ) : @xmath25 and the standard deviation of the logarithm of density , @xmath24 , is a function of the rms sonic mach number of the flow , @xmath26 : @xmath27 or , equivalently , the standard deviation of the linear density is : @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this result is very useful because the rms mach number of the turbulence in molecular clouds is easily estimated through the spectral line width of molecular transitions and by estimating the kinetic temperature .",
    "the three dimensional pdf of gas density is then fully determined by the value of the rms mach number .    a contour plot of @xmath19 , computed from ( [ fbd ] ) and with the log  normal pdf ( [ pdf1 ] ) , on the plane @xmath30@xmath26 , is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to values of rms mach number and average gas density of typical larson relations @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that in regions following the average larson relations , approximately 1% of the total mass is available for the formation of bds ( dotted line in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "if most of the available 1% of the total mass were turned into bds , the number of bds would be comparable to the number of hydrogen burning stars even if as much as 10% of the total mass was turned into stars .",
    "however , it is possible that the formation of bds has a typical efficiency of only a few percent , similar to that of hydrogen burning stars . in that case",
    "their relative abundance in molecular clouds following the average larson relations is expected to be rather low .",
    "for a given size and velocity dispersion , cluster  forming regions are a few times denser than clouds following the average density  size larson relation . in cluster  forming regions , the mass available for the formation of bds can be very large , @xmath31 . as an example",
    ", the stellar mass density in the central @xmath32  arcmin ( @xmath33  pc ) of the young cluster ic 348 @xcite corresponds approximately to @xmath34  @xmath13 .",
    "because the star formation efficiency is likely to be less than unity , the initial gas density in that region must have been even larger .",
    "if we assume a gas density of @xmath35  @xmath13 ( corresponding to a star formation efficiency of 40% ) and a velocity dispersion taken from the average velocity  size larson relation at a size equal to 0.35  pc , we get @xmath36 , as shown by the square in figure  [ fig1 ] . other cluster  forming regions , such as the central region of the trapezium cluster @xcite , show similar stellar mass densities as ic 348 . with such a large value of @xmath19 , cluster  forming regions may in principle form as many bds as hydrogen burning stars , even if the efficiency of bd formation ( from the gas with density larger than @xmath37 ) is as low as the star formation efficiency for hydrogen burning stars .",
    "the cross in the middle of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the values of @xmath30 and @xmath26 corresponding to the initial conditions in the simulation by @xcite .",
    "they simulate a cloud with a total mass of 50  m@xmath2 , a diameter of 0.375  pc , a mean molecular weight of the gas of 2.46 , a temperature of 10  k and a kinetic energy of the turbulence equal to the cloud gravitational potential energy . from these initial conditions we obtain @xmath38  @xmath13 and rms sonic mach number of the turbulence @xmath39 .",
    "the contour plot indicates that 5% of the total mass is in this case available for the formation of bds , sufficient to generate as many bds as hydrogen burning stars , as discussed above .",
    "this suggests that under the conditions assumed in that simulation bds could originate in large abundance as the result of the turbulent fragmentation .",
    "in order to provide a quantitative estimate of the bd abundance , a model for the structure of the density distribution is required . there has been significant progress in the analytical theory of supersonic turbulence in recent works @xcite .",
    "some results regarding the scaling of structure functions of the density field are already available @xcite and could be used in the future for a rigorous analytical study of the process of turbulent fragmentation .",
    "a simple model of the expected mass distribution of dense cores generated by supersonic turbulence has been proposed in @xcite , on the basis of the two following assumptions : i ) the power spectrum of the turbulence is a power law ; ii ) the typical size of a dense core scales as the thickness of the postshock gas .",
    "the first assumption is a basic result for turbulent flows and holds also in the supersonic regime @xcite .",
    "the second assumption is suggested by the fact that postshock condensations are assembled by the turbulent flow in a dynamical time .",
    "condensations of virtually any size can therefore be formed , independent of their jeans mass .    with these assumptions ,",
    "together with the jump conditions for mhd shocks ( density contrast proportional to the alfvnic mach number of the shock ) , the mass distribution of dense cores can be related to the power spectrum of turbulent velocity , @xmath40 .",
    "the result is the following expression for the core mass distribution : @xmath41 if the turbulence spectral index @xmath42 is taken from the analytical prediction @xcite , which is consistent with the observed velocity dispersion - size larson relation @xcite and with our numerical results @xcite , then @xmath43 and the mass distribution is @xmath44 almost identical to the salpeter stellar imf @xcite .",
    "the exponent of the mass distribution is rather well constrained , because the value of @xmath42 for supersonic turbulence can not be smaller than the incompressible value , @xmath45 ( sligthly larger with intermittency corrections ) , and the burgers case , @xmath46 . as a result",
    ", the exponent of the mass distribution is predicted to be well within the range of values of 1.3 and 1.5 . in the following we use @xmath47 , corresponding to a core mass distribution @xmath48 .    while massive cores are usually larger than their critical mass , @xmath8 , the probability that small cores are dense enough to collapse is determined by the statistical distribution of core density .",
    "in order to compute this collapse probability for small cores , we assume i ) the distribution of core density can be approximated by the log  normal pdf of gas density and ii ) the core density and mass are statistically independent . because of the intermittent nature of the log - normal pdf , even very small ( sub  stellar ) cores have a finite chance to be dense enough to collapse . based on the first assumption",
    ", we can compute the distribution of the critical mass , @xmath49 , from the log  normal pdf of gas density assuming constant temperature @xcite . the fraction of cores of mass @xmath50 larger than their critical bonnor ",
    "ebert mass is given by the integral of @xmath51 from 0 to @xmath50 .",
    "using the second assumption of statistical independence of core density and mass , the mass distribution of collapsing cores is @xmath52\\,{\\rm d}\\ln m ~. \\label{imfpdf}\\ ] ] the mass distribution is found to be a power law , determined by the power spectrum of turbulence , for masses larger than approximately 1 m@xmath2 ( using physical parameters typical of molecular clouds ) . at smaller masses the mass distribution flattens , reaches a maximum at a fraction of a solar mass , and then decreases with decreasing stellar mass .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows five mass distributions computed from equation ( [ imfpdf ] ) .",
    "three of them ( solid lines ) are computed for @xmath53  @xmath13 , @xmath54  k and for three values of the sonic rms mach number , @xmath55 , 10 and 20 .",
    "an increase in the rms mach number by a factor of two , from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , results in a growth of the abundance of 0.07  m@xmath2 stars by more than a factor of ten ( relative to stars of approximately 1  m@xmath2 or larger ) . from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , the abundance of 0.07  m@xmath2 stars increases by approximately a factor of three . the other two mass distributions ( dotted lines ) are computed for @xmath56 , @xmath54  k and density @xmath58  @xmath13 ( lower plot ) , and @xmath59  @xmath13 ( upper plot ) .",
    "the imf of the cluster ic 348 in perseus , obtained by @xcite , is plotted in the lower panel of figure  [ fig2 ] ( solid line histogram ) . the imf of this cluster has been chosen for the comparison with the theoretical model because it is probably the most reliable observational imf including both brown dwarfs and hydrogen burning stars .",
    "spectroscopy has been obtained for every star and the sample is unbiased in mass and nearly complete down to 0.03  @xmath60 . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we have also plotted the theoretical mass distribution computed for @xmath61  @xmath13 , @xmath54  k and @xmath62 . as discussed above ,",
    "these parameters are appropriate for the central @xmath32  arcmin of the cluster ( @xmath63  pc ) , where the stellar density corresponds to approximately @xmath34  @xmath13 .",
    "the figure shows that the theoretical distribution of collapsing cores , computed with parameters inferred from the observational data , is roughly consistent with the observed stellar imf in the cluster ic 348 .",
    "similar imfs were obtained for the trapezium cluster in orion by @xcite and for the inner region of the orion nebula cluster by @xcite , using dantona and mazzitelli s 1997evolutionary models . however , based on @xcite evolutionary models , these two imfs contain a slightly larger abundance of brown dwarfs than found in ic 348 and predicted by the theoretical model ( unless larger values of density or mach number are assumed ) .",
    "a larger bd abundance is found in @xmath24 orionis by @xcite , while the imfs obtained by @xcite for ic348 and the pleiades imf @xcite are consistent with the imf in the orion nebula cluster .",
    "several other imfs of young clusters , including both stellar and sub  stellar masses , have been recently obtained .",
    "the present theoretical model may in some cases underestimate the bd abundance , if a significant fraction of bds are formed as members of binary systems , because the process of binary formation is not taken into account . as an example , if most prestellar cores assembled by the turbulence were able to fragment into binary stars due to processes unrelated to turbulent fragmentation , the final bd abundance would be increased , while at larger masses the mass distribution would be indistinguishable from the one predicted by the model .",
    "@xcite found that the number of bds in taurus is 12.8 times lower than in the trapezium cluster @xcite .",
    "this result was based on a single bd detection and on several low mass stars .",
    "the deficit of bds in taurus relative to the trapezium cluster has been confirmed in a more recent work by @xcite , although reduced to approximately a factor of two between the bd abundance of orion and taurus .",
    "the smaller relative abundance of bds in taurus may be explained by the analytical model as due to a decrease in the turbulent velocity dispersion ( rms mach number ) or in the average gas density by less than a factor of two .",
    "this is consistent with the lower velocity dispersion and density in taurus relative to orion .",
    "the mass distribution of prestellar condensations can be measured directly in numerical simulations of supersonic turbulence . with a mesh of 250@xmath64 computational cells , and assuming a size of the simulated region of a few pc , it is not possible to follow numerically the gravitational collapse of individual protostellar condensations . however",
    ", dense cores at the verge of collapse can be selected in numerical simulations by an appropriate clumpfind algorithm .",
    "we use an algorithm that selects cores by scanning the full range of density levels .",
    "it eliminates large cores that are fragmented into smaller and denser ones .",
    "cores are also excluded if their gravitational energy is not large enough to overcome thermal and magnetic support against the collapse , because only collapsing cores are selected .",
    "a mass distribution of collapsing cores , derived from the density distribution in a numerical simulation is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the mass distribution is computed from two snapshots of a 250@xmath64 simulation with rms mach number @xmath65 .",
    "we have used a random external force on large scale and an isothermal equation of state ( for details of the numerical method see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the average gas density has been scaled to 500  @xmath13 and the size of the computational box to 10  pc .",
    "these values have been chosen to be able to select condensations in a range of masses from a sub  stellar mass to approximately 10  m@xmath2 . with this",
    "particular values of average gas density , size and resolution of the computational box , the smallest mass that can be achieved numerically is 0.057  m@xmath2 .    the analytical mass distribution , @xmath66 , computed with the same physical parameters used in the numerical simulation ( @xmath67  @xmath13 , @xmath54  k and @xmath56 ) is plotted in figure  [ fig3 ] as a dashed line .",
    "there is no free parameter to adjust the shape of the analytical function and its mass scale , once the values of density , temperature , and rms mach number have been specified to agree with those assumed in the numerical experiment .",
    "the agreement between the numerical and the analytical mass distributions provides strong support for our simple analytical model of the mass distribution of collapsing cores generated by supersonic turbulence .",
    "in this work we have investigated the possibility that gravitationally unstable protostellar cores of bd mass are assembled by turbulent shocks . we have found that a fraction of bd mass cores formed by the turbulence are dense enough to collapse .",
    "the predicted bd abundance is consistent with the abundance observed in young stellar clusters if the theoretical imf is computed with average density and rms sonic mach number appropriate for dense cluster  forming regions inside molecular cloud complexes .",
    "we have not studied the evolution of turbulent density fluctuations smaller than their critical mass . if subcritical fluctuations of bd mass are inside a larger collapsing core , they would be increasing their density as the background collapses .",
    "additional fluctuations may also be created by turbulence during the collapse . under appropriate conditions ,",
    "a fraction of these fluctuations may be able to collapse into additional bds or giant planets .",
    "future numerical simulations designed to study this process will require not only a very large dynamical range of scales , possibly achieved only by particle or adaptive mesh refinement codes , but also an accurate physical description of the supersonic turbulence including magnetic forces .",
