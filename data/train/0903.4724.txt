    "the current observations , such as sneia ( supernovae type ia ) , cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) and large scale structure , converge on the fact that a spatially homogeneous and gravitationally repulsive energy component , referred as dark energy , accounts for about @xmath1 % of the energy density of universe .",
    "some heuristic models that roughly describe the observable consequences of dark energy were proposed in recent years , a number of them stemming from a certain physics @xcite and the others being purely phenomenological @xcite .",
    "dark energy can even behave as a phantom and effectively violate the weak energy condition@xcite .    in various cosmological models ,",
    "fundamental quantities are either geometrical ( if they are constructed from a spacetime geometry directly ) or physical ( if they depend upon physical fields ) .",
    "physical quantities are certainly model - dependent , while geometrical quantites are more universal .",
    "about thirty years ago , the bouncing cosmological model with torsion was suggested in ref.@xcite , but the torsion was imagined as playing role only at high densities in the early universe .",
    "goenner et al . made a general survey of the torsion cosmology @xcite , in which the equations for all the pgt ( poincar gauge theory of gravity ) cases were discussed although they only solved in detail a few particular cases .",
    "recently some authors have begun to study torsion as a possible reason of the accelerating universe @xcite .",
    "nester and collaborators @xcite consider an accounting for the accelerated universe in term of a riemann - cartan geometry : dynamic scalar torsion .",
    "they explore the possibility that the dynamic pgt connection , reflecting the nature of dynamic pgt torsion , provides the accelerating force . with the usual assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy in cosmology and specific cases of the suitable parameters and initial conditions , they find that torsion field could play a role of dark energy",
    ".    one of the motivation was to avoid singularities in the initial investigations of torsion cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , it soon was found that non - linear torsion effects were more likely to produce stronger singularities @xcite .",
    "the non - linear effects turn out to play a key role for the outstanding present day mystery : the accelerated universe . in the various pgt ,",
    "the connection dynamics decomposed into six modes with certain spin and parity : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "some investigations showed that @xmath4 may well be the only acceptable dynamic pgt torsion modes @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar mode @xmath5 is naturally driven by the intrinsic spin of elementary fermions , therefore it naturally interacts with such sources .",
    "consequently , it is generally thought that axial torsion must be small and have small effects at the late time of cosmological evolution .",
    "this is a major reason why one does not focus on this mode at the late time . on the other hand , the scalar mode @xmath6 does not interact in any direct obvious fashion with any known type of matter @xcite ,",
    "therefore one can imagine it as having significant magnitude and yet not being conspicuously noticed .",
    "furthermore , there is a critical non - zero value for the affine scalar curvature since @xmath6 mode can interact indirectly through the non - linear equations .",
    "the homogeneity and isotropy of cosmology have received strong confirmation from modern observations , which greatly restrict the possible types of non - vanishing fields . under the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy",
    ", @xmath6 mode has only a time component and it can be specified as the gradient of a time - dependent function .",
    "therefore , the cosmological models with the scalar mode offer a situation where dynamic torsion may lead to observable effect at late time .",
    "we emphasize again that one does not focus on the early universe , where one could indeed expect large effects ( though their signature would have to be separated from other large effects ) , and substitutionally asks about traces of torsion effects at the late time of cosmological evolution @xcite .",
    "obviously , the fine - tuning problem is one of the most important issues for the torsion cosmology @xcite . and a good model should limit the fine - tuning as much as possible .",
    "the dynamical attractor of the cosmological system has been employed to make the later time behaviors of the model insensitive to the initial condition of the field and thus alleviates the fine - tuning problem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nester et al @xcite have shown that the hubble parameter and @xmath7 have an oscillatory form for the scalar torsion cosmology .    the traditional geometrical parameters , i.e. , the hubble parameter @xmath8 and the deceleration parameter @xmath9 , are two elegant choices to describe the expansion state of universe but they can not distinguish various accelerating mechanism uniquely , because a quite number of models may just correspond to the same current values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , sahni , saini , starobinsky and alam @xcite have introduced the statefinder pair @xmath12 : @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "it is obviously a natural next step beyond @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "fortunately , as is shown in the literatures @xcite , the statefinder parameters which are also geometrical diagnostics , are able to differentiate a series of cosmological models successfully . using the discussion of statefinder parameters in the scalar torsion cosmology ,",
    "we explain easily why the present field equations modify the expansion of the universe only at late time .",
    "if the evolving trajectory of statefinder have a decelerating phase ( @xmath15 ) at early time , then we can understand why the expansion of the universe until @xmath16 remains unchanged in the scalar torsion models .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the statefinder diagnostics to the torsion cosmology .",
    "we find that there are some characteristics of statefinder parameters for the torsion cosmology that can be distinguished from the other cosmological models .",
    "the statefinder diagnostics show that the universe naturally has an accelerating expansion at low redshifts ( late time ) and a decelerating expansion at high redshifts ( early time ) . therefore",
    ", scalar torsion cosmology can avoid some of the problems which occur in other models .",
    "especially , the effect of torsion can make the expansion rate oscillate when torsion parameter @xmath17 or @xmath18 . whether the universe has properties which are easier to explain within the scalar torsion context is a remarkable possibility demanding further exploration .",
    "the oscillatory feature of hubble parameter had earlier been reported for the braneworld cosmology @xcite and the quasi - steady state cosmology @xcite .",
    "we show that statefinder diagnostic has a direct bearing on the critical points of the dynamical system .",
    "one of the most interesting characteristic of the trajectories is that there are loop and curves with the shape of tadpole in the case of the torsion parameter @xmath19 . in this case",
    ", we fit the scalar torsion model to current type ia supernova data and find it is consistent with the observations .",
    "furthermore , we analyze preliminarily the relevance for realistic observation of the found statefinder parameters .",
    "pgt @xcite has been regarded as an interesting alternative to general relativity because of its gauge structure and geometric properties .",
    "pgt based on a riemann - cartan geometry , allows for dynamic torsion in addition to curvature .",
    "the affine connection of the riemann - cartan geometry is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the levi - civita connection and @xmath22 is the torsion tensor .",
    "meantime , the ricci curvature and scalar curvature can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the riemannian ricci curvature and scalar curvature , respectively , and @xmath26 is the covariant derivative with the levi - civita connection ( for a detailed discussion see ref .",
    ". theoretical analysis of pgt led us to consider tendentiously dynamic `` scalar mode '' . in this case , the restricted expression of the torsion can be written as @xcite @xmath27\\kappa},\\label{trestrct}\\ ] ] where the vector @xmath28 is the trace of the torsion .",
    "then , the ricci curvature and scalar curvature can be expressed as @xmath29 the gravitational lagrangian density for the scalar mode is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath0 is a torsion parameter .",
    "consider that the parameter @xmath32 is associated with quadratic scalar curvature term @xmath33 , so that @xmath32 should be positive @xcite .",
    "therefore , the field equations of the scalar mode are @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the source energy - momentum tensor and @xmath36 is the contribution of the scalar torsion mode to the effective total energy - momentum tensor : @xmath37    since current observations favor a flat universe , we will work in the spatially flat robertson - walker metric @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 is the scalar factor .",
    "this engenders the riemannian ricci curvature and scalar curvature : @xmath40 where @xmath39 is the scalar factor , and @xmath10 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the torsion @xmath41 should also be only time dependent , therefore one can let @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the torsion field ) and the spatial parts vanish .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion in the matter - dominated era are as follows @xmath44 where @xmath45 and the energy density of matter component @xmath46    one can scale the variables and the parameters as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the present value of hubble parameter and @xmath49 is the planck length . under the transform ( [ scale ] ) , eqs .",

    "the present value of the hubble parameter is unity .",
    "obviously , @xmath10 is damped - oscillating at late time and @xmath67 is negative today , which means the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating .",
    "the value of @xmath11 turns from positive to negative when the time is around @xmath68 , which is the epoch the universe began to accelerate .",
    "however , the above result is dependent on the choice of initial data and the values of the parameters .",
    "then , the scalar torsion cosmology is unsuited to solving the fine - tuning problem in the case of @xmath65 . in the following sections",

    "for the spatially flat @xmath69cdm model the statefinder parameters correspond to a fixed point @xmath70 while @xmath71 for the standard cold dark matter model ( scdm ) containing no radiation .",
    "since the torsion cosmology have used the dynamic scalar torsion ( a geometry quantity in the riemann - cartan spacetime ) , the torsion accelerating mechanism is bound to exhibit an essential distinction in contrast with various dark energy models .",

    "the statefinder diagnostic divides the torsion parameter @xmath0 into four ranges , which is in keeping with the requirement of dynamical analysis .",
    "therefore , the statefinder diagnostic can be used to an exceedingly general category of models including several for which the notion of equation of state is not directly applicable .",
    "the statefinder diagnostic has the advantage over the dynamical analysis at the simplicity , but the latter can provide more information .",
    "the most interesting characteristic of the trajectories is that there is a loop in the case of @xmath217 .",
    "this behavior corresponds to the heteroclinic orbit connecting the negative attractor and de sitter attractor .",
    "the trajectories with the shape of tadpole show that they pass through the @xmath69cdm fixed point along the time evolution , then the statefinder pairs are going along with a loop and they will pass through the @xmath69cdm fixed point again in the future .",
    "it is worth noting that there exists closed loop in the ref .",

    "if we refuse the possibility of non - positivity of the kinetic energy , we have to employ normal assumption ( @xmath17 ) . under this assumption ,",
    "the effect of torsion can make the expansion rate oscillate .",
    "furthermore , with suitable adjustments of the torsion parameters and initial value , it is possible to change the quasi - period of expansion rate as well as its amplitudes . in order to have a quantitative understanding of the scalar torsion cosmology , the matter density @xmath219 , the effective mass density @xmath220 , and the quantity @xmath221 are important .",

    "the @xmath222 parameters in the torsion cosmology and in the @xmath69cdm cosmology can nevertheless be quite different .",
