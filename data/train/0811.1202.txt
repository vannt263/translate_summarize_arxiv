    "to understand nature of the deconfining phase transition in qcd at finite temperature and/or density is one of current topics of great interest in hadron physics .",
    "the experimental results on heavy - ion collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , which may have probed a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , have brought remarkable results .",
    "one of them is elliptic flow suggesting a small ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy .",
    "this result can not be reproduced by an ordinary weakly coupled plasma , so it has been described , rather , as a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma . in this talk",
    ", we discuss how the shear viscosity can be small even in perturbation theory , for moderate values of the coupling near the phase transition .    at the deconfining phase transition , the physical degrees of freedom change from mesons and baryons , for which the pressure is of order one , to quarks and gluons , with pressures of order @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the number of colors and flavors .",
    "it is useful to view deconfinement as the ionization of color charge . in the confined phase",
    ", there is no ionization of color .",
    "conversely , far into the deconfined phase , color is completely ionized .",
    "the ionization in non abelian gauge theory is characterized by the renormalized polyakov loop , which is an order parameter for a global @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "while the polyakov loop is a strict order parameter in pure yang - mills theory , in qcd it is only an approximate order parameter .",
    "lattice simulations , however , find that the renormalized polyakov loop is numerically close to a good order parameter , e.g. , the susceptibility of the polyakov loop has a sharp peak at @xmath0  @xcite . at extremely high temperature ,",
    "quarks and gluons are almost freely moving , and one has a complete qgp , where the renormalized polyakov loop is near one , and is insensitive to temperature . in the hadronic phase ,",
    "the value of polyakov loop is almost zero up to near @xmath0 .    in the intermediate region",
    ", it is expected that the polyakov loop changes strongly with temperature , and represents the partial ionization of color .",
    "we refer to this region as a `` semi''-qgp .",
    "obvious questions are : how wide is the semi - qgp , and how do observables change in it ? lattice simulations provide partial answers to these questions : for three colors , they find that a semi - qgp window is @xmath0 to @xmath8 in pure yang - mills theory and @xmath9 to @xmath10 with @xmath11 flavors of dynamical quarks  @xcite .",
    "the rhic experiment could probe a semi - qgp .",
    "we expect that not only static observables , such as the pressure , but also dynamical quantities , such as transport coefficients , change strongly in the semi - qgp .",
    "the transport coefficients are parameters in hydrodynamics which can not be determined by itself .",
    "they are calculated in several methods such as kubo formula and kinetic theory . here",
    ", we consider how the shear viscosity changes in the semi - qgp .",
    "we do not give the explicit calculation but a simple explanation for how the shear viscosity can be small even with a small coupling constant in the semi - qgp .",
    "in classical transport theory , the shear viscosity @xmath1 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number density of quarks and gluons , @xmath14 is the mean momentum , and @xmath15 is the mean free path .",
    "there are three possibilities to get small viscosity : the number of particles , mean momentum , or mean free path become small . in a relativistic plasma , @xmath16 for light particles .",
    "we assume that the mean momentum does not get small , so that we treat it as of order @xmath17 . in general",
    ", the mean free path depends on the number of particles .",
    "one may expect that the more dilute the system is , the longer the mean free path is .",
    "in fact , in classical transport theory , the mean free path is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the transport cross section ; thus , @xmath20 .",
    "this is true in a qgp at very high temperatures , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the gauge coupling constant .",
    "the logarithmic term , @xmath24 , is known as the coulomb logarithm , and is caused by an infrared singularity at the forward scattering region . as a result , @xmath25 , which gives the same result of the boltzmann equation , up to overall constant  @xcite .    in the semi - qgp",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "the interaction and the number density of the particles may depend on their color structures because of the partial ionization of color .",
    "then , the average mean free path is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the transport cross section and number density for color indices @xmath29 . if the transport cross section is independent of color , the mean free path reduces to @xmath18 .",
    "we found @xmath30 , and @xmath31 in the semi - qgp @xcite , where @xmath32 is the expectation value of the polyakov loop .",
    "therefore the mean free path @xmath33 does not become small as the density decreases ; the shear viscosity becomes small , @xmath34 , by two powers of the polyakov loop .",
    "this implies that the interactions canceling color are more favored , i.e. , the correlation of colored particles is stronger even for small values of the coupling constant .",
    "consequently , the shear viscosity can be small in the semi - qgp .     of eq .",

    "in the previous section , we discussed how the shear viscosity is suppressed for small values of the polyakov loop . in this section ,",
    "we show numerical results .",
    "we make numerous drastic assumptions to characterize the semi - qgp .",
    "we assume that the coupling constant is small even near @xmath0 . for simplicity , we take the number of colors and flavors to be large .",
    "we work in a semiclassical approximation , so that we can treat the polyakov loop as a constant classical background field about which we expand .",
    "the background field corresponds to an eigenvalue distribution of the polyakov loop .",
    "since this distribution is so far unknown , we need to make assumptions about it .",
    "we use two forms to check the sensitivity of our results .",
    "the first is to take a simple step function , of width @xmath35 , about the origin .",
    "the other is to take a distribution as in the gross - witten matrix model  @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the shear viscosity by employing a boltzmann equation to leading order in @xmath23 and @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "we take the following parameterization to compare with previous work  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the viscosity in absence of the background .",
    "the coefficient @xmath39 is the numerical constant depending on the number of colors and flavors .",
    "@xmath40 is higher order correction beyond the leading - log order ; here we treat it as a parameter .    in fig .",
    "[ fig ] , we show numerical results of @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the differences between eigenvalue distributions are very small , most a few percent over the entire range of @xmath32 .",
    "we find that the shear viscosity is suppressed near @xmath43 or at a small @xmath32 , as we discussed in the previous section .",
    "a bump is observed near @xmath44 .",
    "the value is 25% larger than @xmath38 , which is analytically estimated @xmath45 .",
    "we expect that this non - analytic behavior will be washed out by corrections to higher order .    for hydrodynamics ,",
    "a more important quantity than @xmath1 is the dimensionless ratio , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the entropy density .",
    "this is related to a diffusion constant , @xmath48 . in fig .",
    "[ fig ] , we compare the shear viscosity to the lattice entropy @xmath49 . the coupling constant used is a one - loop running coupling with @xmath50 ; an unknown parameter beyond the leading - log order is taken @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the result strongly depends on the choice of @xmath40 ; however , in any case , @xmath54 is small near @xmath0 , and becomes larger as temperature increases .",
    "we have shown that the shear viscosity is suppressed by two powers of the polyakov loop in the semi - qgp region near @xmath0 .",
    "it is natural to suspect that heavy ion collisions at rhic have probed some region in the semi - qgp .",
    "since one needs a small value of the shear viscosity to fit the experimental data , perhaps one is near @xmath0 .",
    "heavy ion collisions at the lhc may probe temperatures which are significantly higher , possibly well into the complete qgp .",
    "if so , then at small times collisions at the lhc creates a system with large shear viscosity ; as the system cools through @xmath0 , the shear viscosity then drops .",
    "thus the semi - qgp predicts that at short times , the hydrodynamic behavior of heavy ion collisions at the lhc is qualitatively different from that at rhic ."
