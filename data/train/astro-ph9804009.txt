    "in addition , the history of the interstellar environment of the heliosphere appears to be partially recorded by radionucleotides such as @xmath7be and @xmath8c in geologic ice core records ( @xcite ) . because the solar wind density decreases as @xmath9 ( @xmath10=distance to sun ) , the solar wind and interstellar densities are equal at about 5 au ( the orbit of jupiter ) , in the absence of substantial `` filtration . '' around the heliopause due to the coupling between interstellar protons and h@xmath0 resulting from charge exchange ] approximately 98% of the diffuse material in the heliosphere is interstellar gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the physical properties of the outer heliosphere are dominated by interstellar matter ( ism ) .",
    "were the sun to encounter a high density interstellar cloud , it is anticipated that the physical properties of the inner heliosphere would also be ism - dominated .",
    "zank and frisch ( 1998 ) have shown that if the space density of the interstellar cloud which surrounds the solar system were increased to @xmath410 @xmath2 , the properties of the inner heliosphere at the 1 au position of the earth would be dramatically altered .",
    "the accuracy with which the physical properties of the surrounding cloud can be derived from observations of stars within a few parsecs of the sun ( 1 pc@xmath4200,000 au ) depends on the homogeneity and physical parameters of nearby ism .",
    "observations of nearby stars gives sightlines which probe the ensemble of nearby clouds constituting the `` local fluff '' cloud complex .",
    "conclusions based on observations of nearby stars , however , must be qualified by the absence of detailed data pertaining to the small scale structure of the local ism ( lism ) .",
    "more distant cold diffuse interstellar gas is highly structured , replete with dense ( @xmath11 @xmath2 ) , small ( 20200 au ) inclusions occupying in some cases less than 1% of the cloud volume ( @xcite ) .",
    "small scale structures are ubiquitous in interstellar gas , and individual velocity components exhibiting column densities as low as n(h@xmath0)@xmath43@xmath12 @xmath2 are found in cold clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of dense low column density wisps near the sun is allowed by currently available data .",
    "the sun has a peculiar motion with respect to the `` local standard of rest '' ( lsr250 km s@xmath13 ) ; the sun moves through the lsr with a velocity v@xmath416.5 km s@xmath14 towards the apex direction l=53@xmath0 , b=+25@xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "uncertainties on the relative solar - lsr motion appear to be less than 3 km s@xmath14 and @xmath15@xmath0 .",

    "note that the solar path is tilted by @xmath15 with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "the sun oscillates about the galactic plane , crossing the plane every 33 myrs , reaching a maximum distance from the plane of @xmath477 pc .",
    "the last galactic plane `` crossing '' was about 21 myrs ago ( @xcite ) .",
    "this amplitude of oscillation can be compared to scale heights on the order of @xmath450 - 80 pc for cold h@xmath16 and co , @xmath4100 pc for cold h@xmath0 and infrared cirrus , @xmath4250 pc for warm h@xmath0 , and @xmath41 kpc for warm h@xmath5 ( the `` reynolds layer '' ) .",
    "there are three time scales of interest in understanding the environmental history of the solar galactic milieu ",
    "@xmath17 years , @xmath18 years , and @xmath19 years .",
    "prior to entering into the local fluff complex of interstellar clouds , the sun traveled through a region of the galaxy between the orion spiral arm and the spiral arm spur known as the local arm . on the order of a million years ago , the sun was displaced @xmath417 pc in the anti - apex direction , which is towards the present day location of the junction of the borders of the constellations of columba , lepus and canis major .",
    "the motions of the sun and surrounding interstellar cloud with respect to interstellar matter within 500 pc , projected onto the plane , are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "note that the velocity vectors of the sun and interstellar cloud surrounding the solar system are nearly perpendicular in the lsr , implying that the surrounding cloud complex is sweeping past the sun ( see section [ velocity ] ) .",
    "when the morphology of the local fluff complex is considered , it is apparent that sometime during the past @xmath4200,000 years the sun appears to have emerged from a region of space with virtually no interstellar matter ( densities n(h@xmath20 @xmath2 , n(e@xmath21 @xmath2 ) and entered the local fluff complex of clouds ( average densities n(h@xmath0)@xmath40.1 @xmath2 ) outflowing from the scorpius - centaurus association of star - forming regions .",
    "one model for the morphology of the cloud surrounding the solar system predicts that sometime within the past 10,000 years , and possibly within the past 2,000 years , the sun appears to have entered the interstellar cloud in which it is currently situated ( @xcite , frisch 1997 ) .",
    "the cloud surrounding the solar system will be called here the `` local interstellar cloud '' ( lic ) .",
    "the velocity of the cloud surrounding the solar system provides the sole criteria for selecting lic absorption features in nearby stars , and therefore for deducing the structure of this cloud .",

    "these determinations of the cloud velocity from measurements of interstellar gas within the solar system can be compared with the values derived from observations of interstellar absorption lines towards the nearest stars .",
    "the velocity vector of the surrounding cloud has also been determined by fitting the velocities of interstellar absorption line components in a limited number of nearby stars .",
    "the fits by bertin et al .",
    "( 1993a ) give an upwind direction v=25.7 km s@xmath14 , l=5.9@xmath0 , b=16.7@xmath0 , which is consistent with the ulysses he@xmath0 observations .",

    "removing solar motion from these three velocity vectors gives an upwind direction for the lic cloud in the lsr of v=18.7@xmath24 km s@xmath14 from the direction l=327.3@xmath0@xmath11.4@xmath0 , b=0.3@xmath0@xmath11.0@xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",

    "in essence , the local fluff gas is sweeping down on the solar system from the vicinity of @xmath6 cen .",
    "the small difference in the magnitudes and directions of the ulysses versus backscatter vectors introduces a significant uncertainty concerning the structure of the local fluff and the location of the sun with respect to the boundary of the surrounding interstellar cloud .",
    "the uncertainties on the velocity vectors as defined by the flynn et al . versus ulysses versus bertin et al .",
    "( `` ag '' ) vectors do not allow us to make a definitive statement as to whether or not the sun and the nearby star @xmath6 cen are immersed in the same interstellar cloud .",

    "the small differences between these three predictions ( @xmath41.2 km s@xmath14 ) may seem academic , but when compared to observational data these differences have consequences regarding the location of the sun with respect to the edge of the interstellar cloud in which it is situated . the velocities of the mg@xmath5 and fe@xmath5 absorption lines observed in this direction are 17.5 to 18.2 km s@xmath14 with assumed uncertainties on the individual velocities of @xmath11.0 km s@xmath14 ( corresponding to 1/3 of the nominal spectral resolution with which the observations were acquired , @xcite ) .. ] as noted by lallement et al .",

    "this corresponds to a distance to the cloud edge of less than 0.03 pc ( 6000 au ) for n(h)=0.3 @xmath26 ( see section [ neutral ] ) .",
    "in contrast , if the flynn et al .",
    "vector is correct , the uncertainties allow the fe@xmath5 and mg@xmath5 absorption features to be formed in the surrounding cloud , so that log(n(fe@xmath5))=12.36 @xmath26 towards @xmath6 cen ( @xcite ) . using log(n(fe@xmath5)/n(h@xmath0))@xmath45.71 in the surrounding cloud ( table 1 ) then indicates that the cloud edge is at or beyond @xmath6 cen . since the star @xmath6 cen is located in the true upwind direction ( i. e. in the lsr ) , if the ag vector is correct the sun would thus exit the cloud now surrounding the solar system within the next 2,000 years , while if the flynn et al .",

    "euve observations of he@xmath0 and he@xmath5 toward the white dwarf star hz 43 ( a high latitude white dwarf at 60 pc which samples the local fluff complex ) yield an upper limit on the electron density of n(e@xmath3)@xmath290.14 @xmath2 for n(h@xmath0+h@xmath5)=0.150.34 @xmath2 , after comparing n(h@xmath0 ) , n(he@xmath0 ) and n(he@xmath5 ) with the expected cosmic ratio n(h)/n(he)=10/1 and heliospheric he data ( @xcite ) .",
    "hydrogen wall : the observed velocity distribution of interstellar h@xmath0 decelerated by charge exchange with interstellar protons at the heliopause can be reproduced theoretically in the direction of @xmath6 cen for the case where the interstellar gas confining the heliosphere has plasma density n(e@xmath3)=0.1 @xmath2 ( see section [ wall ] ) .",
    "in principle _ in situ _ measurements of pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays can help resolve an active debate as to whether solar or b - star abundances ( which are @xmath4 70% solar ) apply as the correct reference abundance for the interstellar medium.50% higher than abundances in b - stars , and it is an open question as to whether b - star or solar abundances apply to the ism ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "since he is primordial , the correct reference ratio h / he ratio should @xmath410/1 , regardless of whether solar or b - star abundances apply in the ism .",
    "elements that will be sensitive as to whether the correct ism reference abundances are solar versus b - star are ne , ar , n and s , none of which are thought to be depleted onto interstellar dust grains .",
    "therefore , when lic ionization and the filtration of elements at the heliopause are properly understood , measurements of n / he , o / he , ne / he and ar / he ( for example ) will constrain the reference abundance of the lic cloud .",
    "the gas phase abundances of the neutral atomic constituents in the lic are a function of both the ionization and depletion patterns of the gas .",
    "abundant elements in the ism such as c , s , mg , fe , and si , have first ionization potentials ( fip ) less than the 13.6 ev ionization potential of h@xmath0 , so they will be predominantly ionized in the lic .",
    "thus , low - fip elements will be under - represented in the pickup ion population when compared to cosmic abundances .",
    "the relative abundances of common low - fip elements , based on observations typical of warm and cold gas in interstellar clouds , are shown in table 3 .",
    "absorption lines from c@xmath0 , si@xmath0 , fe@xmath0 , s@xmath0 are weak in warm low column density ism .",
    "table 3 : gas - phase neutral elements in sample of interstellar clouds +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     most elements are not present in solar abundances in interstellar gas , a phenomena explained by invoking the depletion of the missing elements onto dust grains which are mixed into the interstellar gas .",
    "recently arguments have been made that the correct reference abundance for the interstellar medium should be b - star abundances , at about 70% solar ( e. g. @xcite ) , reducing the amount of ism tied up in grain mass .",
    "typical gas - to - dust mass ratios of 100:1 are found in the global ism .",
    "depletion patterns depend on cloud type , and nearby interstellar gas shows enhanced abundances with respect to the abundance patterns seen in distant cold clouds ( frisch 1981 ) .",
    "generally elements with high condensation temperatures ( e. g. si , mg , mn , fe , cr , ni , ca , co , ti ) are the most depleted in cold clouds . in warm interstellar clouds",
    "these refractory elements show less depletion , i. e. have higher gas phase abundances ( e. g. see savage and sembach 1996 ) .",
    "warm clouds in the galactic halo have similar properties as warm disk clouds ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "the abundances of fe and mg in table 1 indicate lism gas - phase abundance variations of factors of 25 , suggesting variable grain destrution . in the cold cloud towards the star @xmath52 oph , 99.4% of fe and 97% of mg",
    "are depleted onto dust grains .",
    "in contrast , @xmath490% of fe and @xmath485% of mg are depleted onto dust grains in the lic ( table 1 ) .",
    "these enhanced abundances seen in local gas were the basis for my original conclusion that the interstellar gas surrounding the solar system had been processed through a supernova shock front which had partially destroyed embedded dust grains ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 3 shows gas phase abundances of the most common elements , where in this case the solar abundances have been used as the reference abundance for interstellar gas .",
    "the gas phase abundances in both warm and cloud clouds are shown .",
    "elements with fips less than 13.6 ev will be mainly ionized , whereas o , n , ar , ne , he will be primarily neutral when hydrogen is neutral . also shown are uncertainties in mg , fe , si and o abundances in the lic . predicted ratios mg@xmath0/o@xmath0=2.2 @xmath34 10@xmath51 and s@xmath0/o@xmath0=2.8 @xmath34 10@xmath50 are deduced from the radiative transfer model with lic abundances discussed in section [ ion ] and table 2 .",
    "thus , mg@xmath0 and s@xmath0 are candidates for positive detections in the pickup ion population .",
    "table 1 also summarizes fe and mg abundances towards several nearby stars .",
    "a puzzling pattern emerges from the data in table 1 .",
    "the stars @xmath6 cma , @xmath42 cma and @xmath6 cen , appear to have enhanced mg@xmath5/h@xmath0 and fe@xmath5/h@xmath0 abundances in the foreground interstellar gas when compared to the other stars in the table , a property which may be partly attributed to ionization effects which are not included in the depletion estimates . of the stars listed in table 1 ,",
    "these three stars sample clouds in the most compact region of space around the solar system . for stars sampling more distant regions , uncertainties could be introduced by to unresolved velocity structure in saturated lines , but the good correlation between fe@xmath5 and mg@xmath5 suggests this is not the case ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , this variation could be evidence for abundance variations in the gas - phase ism over the longer sightlines within 20 pc of the sun ( e. g. lallement et al .",
    "1995 , @xcite ) .",
    "this variation corresponds to a factor of @xmath44 variation in gas phase abundances , but much smaller variations in dust mass due to the highly depleted nature of refractories .",
    "the relative motions of the sun and surrounding interstellar cloud result in a pile - up of interstellar h@xmath0 at the nose of the heliosphere caused by the charge exchange coupling of of interstellar h@xmath0 and h@xmath5 ( e. g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this pile - up leaves a signature in the ly@xmath6 absorption line which can , in principle , be distinguished and modeled in the spectrum of nearby stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "gayley et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have modeled the ly@xmath6 due to the pile - up in the spectrum of @xmath6 cen , and found that a barely subsonic heliosphere model with a mach number of 0.9 provided the best fit .",
    "the model parameters used in this fit were n(h@xmath0)=0.14 @xmath2 , n(e@xmath3)=0.1 @xmath2 , t=7,600 k , and v=26 km s@xmath14 .",
    "for this set of parameters , if the excess velocity ( over the sound speed ) is the alfven speed resulting from an interstellar magnetic field , then a magnetic field strength of b=3.1 @xmath28 g is required to achieve a mach number of 0.9 .",
    "this gives sound and alfven speeds of 10.5 and 20.9 km s@xmath14 respectively .",
    "although the full range of parameter space has not yet been explored for the modeling process , supersonic and subsonic models corresponding to mach numbers 1.5 and 0.7 , or magnetic field strengths of 2 and 5 @xmath28 g , were found to provide unacceptable fits to the observed ly@xmath6 profile .",
    "based on this exercise , evidently the properties of astrospheres may be used to determine the pressure of the interstellar medium at the location of a star , as predicted earlier by frisch ( 1993 ) .",
    "one new conclusion presented here is that in principle the _ in situ _ pickup ion data can help resolve the outstanding question of whether the correct reference abundances for the lic are given by solar versus b - star abundances .",
    "a second new result is that the uncertainties on the lic velocity vector indicate that it is not yet clear whether the sun and @xmath6 cen are immersed in the same interstellar cloud .",
    "based on the discussions in this paper , the best values for lic properties are given by n(h@xmath0)=0.22@xmath10.06 @xmath2 , n(e@xmath3)=n(h@xmath5)=0.1 @xmath2 , t=6,900 k and a relative sun - cloud velocity of 25.8@xmath10.8 km s@xmath14 .",
    "however , radiative transfer considerations in the lic suggest that the quoted neutral density is a lower limit .",
    "ulysses and euve observations of he@xmath0 indicate a cloud temperature of t=6,400 k. the magnetic field strength is weakly constrained to be in the range of 23 @xmath28 g .",
    "models of the ly@xmath6 absorption line towards @xmath6 cen are consistent with an alfven velocity of 20.9 km s@xmath14 , which in turn is consistent with an interstellar magnetic field of 3 @xmath28 g in the absence of additional unknown contributions to the interstellar pressure .",
    "ulysses and euve observations of interstellar he@xmath0 within the solar system give an upwind direction for the `` wind '' of interstellar gas through the solar system , in the rest frame of the sun , of v=25.9@xmath10.6 km s@xmath14 arriving from the galactic direction l=4.0@xmath0@xmath10.2@xmath0 , b=15.4@xmath0@xmath10.6@xmath0 .",
    "removing solar motion from this vector gives an upwind direction for the lic cloud in the lsr of v=18.7@xmath24 km s@xmath14 arriving from the direction l=327.3@xmath0@xmath11.4@xmath0 , b=0.3@xmath0@xmath11.0@xmath0 .    through a combination of observations and theory , uncertainties in the lic electron density",
    "are narrowing .",
    "radiative transfer in the sightlines towards nearby stars require that cloud models must be combined with data in order to deduce properties at the cloud location .",
    "radiative transfer models of ionization in the lism show interesting results , but additional understanding of the input radiation fields is needed .",
    "the local fluff complex is structured and inhomogeneous .",
    "striking progress would be made in understanding this structure if interstellar absorption lines could be observed at resolutions of @xmath41 km s@xmath14 in the ultraviolet .",
    "the most glaring uncertainty is the absence of detailed knowledge about the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "many of the most abundant elements in the lic are ionized , and densities of neutral atoms with fips less than 13.6 ev are typically down by 13 orders of magnitude from the dominant ions . the current approach of trying to understand the interaction of the ism with the heliopause , from both the outside in and the inside out , is finally bearing fruit .",
