    "using the adiabatic invariant , @xmath103 , which we label `` entropy '' , allows us to differentiate between gas accreting from voids and filaments . as a precaution , we note that @xmath104 is not an invariant when @xmath81 varies ; however , this is not the case in our simulations in which we permit molecular hydrogen cooling . here",
    "molecular fractions remain low , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 even in the densest regions .",

    "the gas in filaments has lower entropy than the rest of the halo at @xmath110 150 pc and @xmath111 k @xmath109 . in equation ( [ vt ] ) , the pressure in the surface term is the constant at a given radius .",

    "another significant difference in the cooling simulations is the contraction of the virial shock by a factor of 1/3 when compared to adiabatic runs .",

    "the gas will cool to a minimum equilibrium temperature . as the cooling halo collapses and radial velocities increase , the gas still lacks enough kinetic and thermal energy to match the gravitational energy and surface term in equation ( [ vt ] ) .",
    "the gas becomes more turbulent in order to virialize .",
    "we see this in the second row of figure [ fig : energies ] , where turbulent energies are significantly increased well inside the halo in the cooling models as compared to the adiabatic calculations .    through virial analyses",

    "we further investigate the significance and nature of the turbulence through velocity distributions and decompositions in order to study any small - scale anisotropies in the internal flows .",
    "in cdm cosmogony , collisionless dark matter dominates the gravitational potential and oscillates as it stabilizes .",
    "@xcite showed how a collisionless system undergoes violent relaxation if embedded within a rapidly time - varying potential .",

    "we plot the radial and tangential velocity distribution on the top and bottom rows , respectively .",
    "the velocities are taken with respect to the bulk velocity of the halo .",
    "we also transform the velocity components to align the z - axis and total angular momentum vector of the dm halo .",
    "the radial velocity distributions at z = z@xmath91  are approximately maxwellian in both dark matter and gas with a skew toward infall .",
    "the infall distributions are shifted by @xmath411  in the cooling case when compared to adiabatic .",
    "however at z = z@xmath92 , the effects of ly@xmath51  cooling become more prevalent in the halo when compared to h@xmath4  cooling , shifting the radial velocity distribution by @xmath415  that is caused by faster infall .",
    "these distributions have two components that represent virialized gas and infalling gas in filaments .",
    "we further discuss this in the next section .",
    "the tangential velocity distributions are nearly maxwellian in all cases except for the dark matter in simulation a at z = z@xmath92  ( right panels in figure [ fig : veldista]a ) .",
    "this deviation from maxwellian arises from two major mergers that occur between 25 and 85 myr ( z = 1721 ) before the final collapse .",
    "the residual substructure from the major merger causes three distinct populations with gaussian distributions centered at 0.2 , + 13.6 , and 6.7  with @xmath120 = 11.6 , 4.2 and 3.6 , respectively .",
    "these distributions clearly do not resemble a solid body rotator , whose velocity distribution would contain all positive velocities . in other words",
    "the turbulent velocities exceed the typical rotational speeds .",
    "distributions in dark matter are broader than the gas in both simulations and collapse redshifts as expected because for the gas we only give the bulk velocities and do not add the microscopic dispersion ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dark matter velocity distributions are typical of a virialized system with the majority of the matter having a maxwellian distribution with a dispersion corresponding to the main halo @xcite .",
    "substructure appears as smaller , superposed gaussians , which are stripped of its outer material as it orbits the parent halo .",
    "dynamical friction acts on the substructure and decreases its pericenter over successive orbits , and the subhalo is gradually assimilated in the halo .",
    "the filaments penetrate deep into the halo and provide mostly radial infall inside @xmath70 .",
    "they do not experience a virial shock at @xmath70 , and this contrast is apparent in the radial velocity distributions .",
    "when we restrict our analysis scope to the filaments ( i.e. @xmath121 pc and @xmath122 k @xmath123 ) , the radial velocity distribution ( figure [ fig : veldista ] ) is skewed toward infall , centered at 15 km / s , which is approximately the circular velocity of the halo .",
    "the rest of the gas outside of this region in @xmath124 space has already been virialized , shock heated , and roughly exhibits a maxwellian distribution , centered at zero , with its associated substructures .",
    "hence the mass in filaments dominate the radial velocity distributions at negative values in figure [ fig : veldista ] .",
    "radial inflows can create turbulence in the halo .",
    "filaments provide an influx material with distinct angular momentum .",
    "this gas virializes in the presence of an already turbulent medium that has a relatively high specific angular momentum at @xmath125 .",
    "the rayleigh inviscid instability criterion requires @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the specific angular momentum .",
    "if this is not satisfied , the system will become unstable to turbulence .",
    "the onset of turbulence can be delayed if viscosity were large enough so that reynolds numbers are below the order of 10@xmath128 or 10@xmath7 .",
    "however there are many modes of instability if equation ( [ eqn : rayleigh ] ) is not met , and even a gas with low reynolds number will eventually become fully turbulent @xcite .    velocity dispersions can characterize the general magnitude of a turbulent medium , but its local nature is better detailed by applying the cauchy - stokes decomposition , @xmath129 that decomposes the velocity field into bulk motion @xmath130 , vorticity @xmath131 , expansion and contraction @xmath132 , and a distortion @xmath133 without change in volume . here",
    "the vector @xmath134 describes the separation between gas parcels at position @xmath135 and @xmath136 , and @xmath137 is the velocity at @xmath136 .",
    "we relate @xmath138 , which is plotted in figure [ fig : divv ] , to a convergence timescale through the continuity equation , @xmath139 that can be rewritten in terms of the total derivative @xmath140 as @xmath141 @xmath142 describes density changes along the fluid flow lines , and the @xmath143 factor converts this change into an inverse timescale on which local densities e - fold .",
    "we denote @xmath144 as the `` lagrangian convergence timescale '' ( lct ) . converging flows ( @xmath145 ) are ubiquitous within the halo . on large scales ,",
    "the smallest lcts on the order of 20 kyr exist at the virial shock , adjacent to both the filaments and voids . in the cooling models , these timescales are also small in turbulent shocks well within @xmath70 .",
    "analogous to the dynamical time , typical shocked lcts decrease toward the center as density increases .",
    "the local magnitude and nature of turbulence is further illustrated by the vorticity @xmath146 , whose component perpendicular to the slice , @xmath147 , is shown in figure [ fig : curlv ] . the local rotation period , @xmath148 is also helpful to quantify and visualize the nature of the flow .",
    "the vorticity equation reads @xmath149 where the source term is non - zero when the density and pressure gradients are not aligned , i.e. baroclinic vorticity generation .",
    "this occurs at and near shocks throughout the halo , regardless of radiative cooling . in the adiabatic models",
    ", vorticity exists even at modest but sufficient resolution in the large pressure - supported cores ( see @xmath100  for @xmath150 pc in figure [ fig : energies ] ) and generates a turbulent medium with @xmath100  = 0.3 . in the cooling models ,",
    "this large - scale vorticity is still present but increases in the collapsing core .",
    "as shocks become abundant in the center , we do not see any dampening of kinetic energy .",
    "perhaps this mechanism maintains turbulent motions during virialization , even in the presence of dissipative shocks .",
    "in figure [ fig : curlv ] , adjacent , antiparallel fluid flows , i.e. a sign change in @xmath147 , are ubiquitous , which visually demonstrates that turbulence exists throughout the halo .",
    "the length scale of these eddies decrease with increasing density as with the lcts .",
    "hence we believe significant turbulence generated during virialization should be present in all cosmological halos .",
    "the cooling efficiency of the gas , the total halo mass , and partly the merger history determines the magnitude of turbulence .",
    "we discuss some implications of virial turbulence in the following section .",
    "we have investigated the virialization of early pre - galactic cosmological halos in this paper with a suite of amr simulations with varying chemistry and cooling models and collapse epochs .",
    "when analyzing the local virial equilibrium of the halo , we do not assume that it is in equilibrium but explicitly calculate all of the relevant terms in the virial theorem .",
    "in both adiabatic and radiative cooling cases , we find that the kinetic ( turbulent ) energy is comparable , if not dominant , with the thermal energy .",
    "turbulence appreciates as radiative cooling becomes efficient because thermal energy alone can not bring the system into virial equilibrium . in this case , the gas attempts to virialize by increasing and maintaining its kinetic energy .    besides violent relaxation",
    ", at least two other hydrodynamic processes will augment virial turbulence .",
    "the first occurs when radial inflow interacts with the virialized gas . due to the rayleigh criterion",
    ", the high angular momentum gas creates an instability when it is deposited by filaments at small radii .",
    "the second happens when minor and major mergers create kelvin - helmholtz instabilities and drives additional turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results show that this turbulence is acting to achieve close to virial equilibrium at all stages during assembly and collapse .",
    "virial turbulence may be most important in halos which can cool rapidly when compared to virial heating from mass accretion .",
    "interestingly all halo masses below @xmath4110@xmath1 that can cool by ly@xmath51  emission satisfy this condition @xcite .",
    "turbulence appears to mix angular momentum efficiently so that it redistributes to a radially increasing function , and thus only the lowest specific angular momentum material sinks to the center .",
    "this segregation allows a collapse to proceed as it were self - similar and basically non - rotating .",
    "similar results have been reported in cosmological simulations of collapses of the first stars @xcite . here and in protogalactic collapses , the turbulent velocities become supersonic .",
    "one would expect even higher mach numbers in larger potential wells that still have @xmath114  @xmath119  @xmath151 .",
    "the inclusion of the surface term allows us to study the virial equilibrium in the halo s interior where the gravitational potential is not influential . here",
    "our simulations show thermal and kinetic energies balancing the surface term and potential energy to achieve virial equilibrium .",
    "before cooling is efficient , gas virially heats and its temperature can exceed the traditional virial temperature within @xmath70/2  as seen in our adiabatic simulations .",
    "the consequences of this additional heating is substantial because halos can collapse and form stars before the virial temperature reaches the critical temperature , such as @xmath4110,000k for ly@xmath51  cooling .",
    "the timescale at which the center collapse occurs is crucial to the type of object that forms there .",
    "if the collapse occurs faster than a kelvin - helmholtz time for a massive star ( @xmath41 300 kyr ) , a black hole might form from the lowest angular momentum gas .",
    "conversely if the collapse is delayed by turbulent pressure , star formation could occur in the density enhancements created by turbulent shocks .",
    "the ensuing radiative feedback may create outflows and thus slow further infall and possibly prevent the formation of a central black hole .",
    "the nature of the first galaxies poses an important question in the high - redshift structure formation , and to address this problem we must consider their progenitors  the first stars .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that the first , metal - free ( pop iii ) stars form in isolation in its host halo .",
    "they are believed to have stellar masses @xmath41100  @xcite and produce @xmath41@xmath152 photons s@xmath31 that can ionize hydrogen and dissociate h@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional radiative hydrodynamical calculations @xcite and recently three - dimensional radiative hydrodynamical amr @xcite and sph @xcite simulations found that pressure forces from the radiatively heated gas drive a @xmath4130  shock outwards and expels the majority of the gas in the host halo .",
    "additionally the star ionizes the surrounding few kpc of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "pop iii stellar feedback invalidates some of our assumptions in the calculations presented here , but the general aspect of kinetic energy being dominant should hold in the presence of these feedback processes . in a later paper , we will expand our simulations to include radiative feedback from primordial stars ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the metal enrichment from pair instability supernovae @xcite of the igm and subsequent star formation .",
    "we have investigated the process of virialization in pre - galactic gas clouds in two cosmology amr realizations .",
    "our virial analyses included the kinetic ( turbulent ) energies and surface pressures of the baryons in the system .",
    "the significance of each energy component of the gas varies with the effectiveness of the radiative cooling , which we quantify by performing each realization with adiabatic , hydrogen and helium , and h@xmath4  cooling models .",
    "we highlight the following main results of this study as :    \\1 . inside @xmath75",
    ", gas can not virialize alone through heating but must gain kinetic energy .",
    "it is up to a factor of five greater than thermal energy throughout the protogalactic halos .",
    "this manifests itself in a faster bulk inflow and supersonic turbulent motions .",
    "\\2 . in the radiative cooling models , supersonic turbulence ( @xmath153 = 13 ) leads to additional cooling within turbulent shocks .",
    "we expect turbulence in larger galaxies , up to 10@xmath1 , to be even more supersonic .",
    "baryonic velocity distributions are maxwellian that shows violent relaxation occurs for gas as well as dark matter .",
    "turbulent velocities exceed typical rotational speeds , and these halos are only poorly modeled as solid body rotators .",
    "after the halo virializes , its central part will undergo turbulent collapse , such as in primordial star formation and galactic molecular clouds .",
