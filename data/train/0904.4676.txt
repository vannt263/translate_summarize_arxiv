    "the most influential paradox in fluids is the dalembert paradox saying that a body moving through water has no drag as calculated by dalembert @xcite via inviscid theory , while experiments show that there is a substantial drag on the body .",

    "a revolutionary development of the boundary layer theory by ludwig prandtl in 1904 resolved the paradox by paying attention to the substantial effect of small viscosity in the boundary layer .",
    "prandtl s boundary layer theory laid the foundation of modern unified fluid mechanics .",
    "sommerfeld paradox has the potential of being the next most influential paradox in fluids .",
    "the paradox says that the linear shear in couette flow is linearly stable for all reynolds numbers as first calculated by sommerfeld @xcite , but experiments show that any small perturbation size to the linear shear can lead to the transition from the linear shear to turbulence when the reynolds number is large enough .",
    "this paradox is the key for understanding turbulence inside the infinite dimensional phase space .",
    "dynamical system studies on the navier - stokes flow in an infinite dimensional phase space is still at its developing stage . in this article",
    ", we shall conduct such a study to offer a resolution to the sommerfeld paradox .",
    "linear hydrodynamic stability is a classical subject , for a modern version with dynamical system flavor , see @xcite .",
    "couette flow between two parallel horizontal plates is the simplest of all classical fluid flows with boundary layers .",
    "it is one of the most fundamental flows for understanding the transition to turbulence .",
    "another basic flow is pipe poiseuille flow , which is also linearly stable for any reynolds number as shown by numerical computations .",
    "but reynolds s famous experiment in 1883 showed the transition to turbulence for large reynolds number . indeed , there are lots of similar features in the study of transient turbulence of plane couette flow and pipe poiseuille flow @xcite .",
    "we expect that some of our studies for couette flow in this paper could be useful for understanding the turbulence of pipe poiseuille flow .",
    "the linear stability of couette flow was first studied by sommerfeld in 1908 @xcite using a single fourier mode analysis to the linearized navier - stokes equations .",
    "sommerfeld found that all eigenvalues are non - positive for all values of the reynolds number , indicating the absence of exponentially growing eigen modes , and concluded that the linear shear is linearly stable for all reynolds numbers .",
    "this fact was rigorously proved by romanov @xcite who showed that all the eigenvalues are less than @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the reynolds number and @xmath3 is a positive constant ; furthermore , the linear shear is nonlinearly asymptotically stable in @xmath4 norm of vorticity . on the other hand , experimentally no matter how small the initial perturbation to the linear shear is , a transition to turbulence always occurs when the reynolds number is large enough .",
    "now we briefly comment on some previous attempts to explain sommerfeld paradox .",
    "one popular resolution , which was first suggested by orr @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , is to use the non - normality of the linearized navier - stokes operator to get algebraic growth of perturbations before their final decay .",
    "( note : non - normality refers to operators with non - orthogonal eigenfunctions . )",
    "however , it is not clear how such linear algebraic growth relates to the nonlinear dynamics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the non - normality theory can not explain many coherent structures observed in the transient turbulence .",
    "we believe that norms play a fundamental role in resolving the paradox .",
    "perturbations with large @xmath4 norm of vorticity may still have small @xmath4 norm of velocity , i.e. , small energy . in experimental or numerical studies ,",
    "such perturbations of small energy are still considered to be small , but they are outside the vorticity s @xmath4 neighborhood of the linear shear where romanov s nonlinear stability result is valid @xcite . therefore , such perturbations have the potential of being linearly unstable and initiating the transition to turbulence .    the main idea of our resolution is to show the existence of a sequence of linearly unstable shears which approach the linear shear in the velocity variable but not in the vorticity variable .",
    "these shears are the single modes of the fourier series of all the 2d shears of the couette flow @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , our sequence of oscillatory shears has the form @xmath6 as @xmath7 , the oscillatory shears approach the linear shear , i.e. @xmath8 in @xmath4 and @xmath9 . on the other hand , in the vorticity variable",
    ", the oscillatory shears do not approach the linear shear since @xmath10 in any lebesgue norm .",
    "thus in the velocity variable , the oscillatory shears can be viewed as the linear shear plus small noises . for any large @xmath11 , we prove that @xmath12 is linearly unstable for both inviscid and slightly viscous fluids .",
    "more precisely , in theorems [ ost ] and [ los ] , it is shown that these shears are linearly ( exponentially ) unstable for both euler equations and navier - stokes equations with large reynolds numbers . under the navier - stokes dynamics ,",
    "our shears are not steady rather drifting slowly . by viewing them as frozen",
    ", we investigate the spectra of the corresponding linearized navier - stokes operator ( orr - sommerfeld operator ) .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations @xcite indicate that its unstable growth rate does not depend on @xmath11 substantially , implying that as @xmath7 , its unstable growth rate does not shrink to zero rather approach a positive number .",
    "such a linear instability will generate the transition to turbulence no matter how small the initial perturbation added to the linear shear is , as long as the reynolds number is large enough to realize the linear instability .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite indicates that initial perturbations to @xmath12 indeed lead to a transient nonlinear growth .",
    "in fact , our new theory proposed in @xcite claims that such a transient nonlinear growth induced by slowly drifting states is the only mechanism for transition from the linear shear to turbulence .    based upon comments from our colleagues , it is important to clarify a few points here :    1 .",
    "a more precise formulation of the sommerfeld paradox is : one one hand , the linear shear is linearly stable . on the other hand , experiments indicate that for any @xmath13 , there is a @xmath14 such that when the reynolds number is larger than @xmath15 , there is a perturbation of size @xmath16 that leads to the transition from the linear shear to turbulence . due to various difficulties and lack of a precise mathematical direction , experiments in the past were often less conclusive and confusing .",
    "but recent experiments gradually converge to the conclusion of the precise mathematical statement above",
    "it is fundamental to notice that our sequence of oscillatory shears ( [ formula - u_n ] ) is uniformly unstable for all positive integers @xmath11 , i.e. for _ any _ @xmath17 , @xmath18 is linearly unstable .",
    "3 .   under the navier - stokes dynamics",
    ", our sequence of oscillatory shears drifts as follows : @xmath19 in terms of the above sommerfeld paradox , for any @xmath16 , we can find a @xmath11 such that @xmath20 , then there is a @xmath21 such that when the reynolds number is larger than @xmath15 ( i.e. @xmath22 ) , the orr - sommerfeld ( linear navier - stokes ) operator has an unstable eigenvalue at such a @xmath18 ( [ formula - u_n ] ) .",
    "now we inspect the drifting ( [ dros ] ) for such @xmath18 : @xmath23 the dual effect of @xmath11 and @xmath24 above can prevent the drifting exponent @xmath25 to be too large , therefore prevent the oscillatory component of @xmath18 to be quickly dissipated .",
    "in fact , when the reynolds number is larger enough ( i.e. @xmath21 is small enough ) , the drifting exponent @xmath25 is very small , therefore the drifting and the dissipation the oscillatory component are very slow .",
    "the linear instability of @xmath18 then has plenty of time to be amplified , leading to the observations in the experiments , and the resolution of the sommerfeld paradox . finally , even when @xmath26 , the amplitude of the oscillatory component of @xmath18 is already very small @xmath27 .    in theorem [ thm - catseye ]",
    ", we prove the bifurcation to nontrivial travelling solutions to 2d euler equation , near the oscillatory shear @xmath12 in the energy norm .",
    "the streamlines of these travelling waves have the structure of kelvin s cat s eyes .",
    "this study has been recently extended in @xcite to show that ( vorticity ) @xmath28 is the critical regularity for nontrivial euler traveling waves to exist near couette flow ( see remark [ rmk - tw - critical ] ) . in theorem",
    "[ tm - robust ] , we also show that 3d shears @xmath29 in a neighborhood ( @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) in the velocity variable ) of any linearly unstable 2d shear ( including our @xmath12 ) are linearly unstable too .",
    "this shows that the instability found near couette flow in theorem [ ost ] is also robust in the @xmath32d setting .    in recent years",
    ", there has been a renaissance in numerical dynamical system studies on fluids .",
    "the focus was upon three classical flows : plane couette flow , plane poiseuille flow , and pipe poiseuille flow .",
    "basic flows of them are the linear shear for plane couette flow , and the parabolic shear for both plane and pipe poiseuille flows .",
    "original studies on transition to turbulence for these flows were conducted by the orszag group @xcite @xcite .",
    "primitive steak - roll - wave coherent structures were discovered .",
    "the orszag group also emphasized the importance of the slowly drifting states like our @xmath12 . in 1990 , nagata made a breakthrough by discovering 3d steady states ( fixed points ) in plane couette flow @xcite .",
    "there are two branches of 3d steady states , called upper and lower branches .",
    "the same 3d steady states also appeared in plane poiseuille flow @xcite .",
    "most recently the same 3d steady states were also discovered in pipe poiseuille flow and they become traveling waves with constant speeds in the laboratory @xcite @xcite . the pipe discovery made laboratory experiment easy to implement . indeed , hof et al .",
    "observed such traveling waves in experiments @xcite .",
    "a steady state ( fixed point ) study is generally the starting point of a full dynamical system study which is still in progress @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing new discovery on the steady states is that the lower branch steady states of the three classical flows share some universal feature , i.e. they all approach 3d shears as the reynolds number approaches infinity @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "such 3d shears ( @xmath33 ) are neutrally stable under the linearized euler dynamics .",
    "so they are not our 3d shears in the neighborhood of our @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "any 3d shear ( @xmath34 ) is a steady state of the 3d euler equations ; so it is interesting to understand the special features of the limiting 3d shear of the lower branch .",
    "a necessary condition on such a limiting 3d shear was also discovered @xcite . in numerical and experimental studies on transition to turbulence",
    ", one often observes the steak - roll - wave structure .",
    "the streak and roll are the @xmath35-th fourier mode , while the wave is the higher fourier mode in the fourier series of the velocity field .",
    "when plotting these modes separately , the steak - roll - wave structure should generically be observed .",
    "taking into account the linear instability of our 3d shears in a neighborhood of our @xmath12 , such steak - roll - wave structures will be generated too .",
    "the 3d steady state argument on the sommerfeld paradox claims that the stable manifolds of the 3d steady states may get very close ( they can not be connected ) to the linear shear in the infinite dimensional phase space , which leads to the transition from the linear shear to turbulence @xcite .",
    "the main criticism of this argument is that these 3d steady states are not close to the linear shear in the phase space even in the kinetic energy norm ; while experiments show that no matter how small the initial perturbation to the linear shear is , a transition always occurs when the reynolds number is large enough .",
    "we believe that the linear instability of our @xmath12 ( and 3d shears in its neighborhood ) offers a better explanation for the initiation of transition from the linear shear to turbulence . in other words ,",
    "the key point for answering the sommerfeld paradox is whether or not there is a linear instability happening arbitrarily close to the linear shear . our @xmath12 ( and 3d shears in its neighborhood ) does the job .",
    "again , they approach the linear shear in the velocity variable but not the vorticity variable , in consistency with romanov s nonlinear stability theorem @xcite . on the other hand , stable manifolds of the 3d steady states can often only be established in higher sobolev spaces in which romanov s nonlinear stability theorem prohibits them to get close to the linear shear .",
    "explorations on two dimensional viscous steady states turn out to be not successful so far @xcite @xcite .",
    "that is , the counterpart of the 3d upper or lower branch steady state has not been found in 2d . a formal analysis in @xcite confirms the non - existence of a viscous steady state in 2d . on the other hand ,",
    "numerics shows that transitions still occur from the linear shear to turbulence in 2d .",
    "this further confirms that the stable manifolds of the 3d steady states are not the initiators for the transition . under the 2d euler dynamics ,",
    "theorem [ thm - catseye ] shows the existence of 2d inviscid steady states with cat s eye structures .",
    "the neighborhood of these eye structures might be a good place for a future numerical search of 2d viscous steady states .",
    "a rigorous proof on the existence of 3d steady states in the three classical flows remains open .",
    "the main difficulty is the lack of a proper bifurcation point .",
    "there is no hope directly from the linear shear end since it is linearly stable . from the infinite reynolds number limiting shear of the lower branch ,",
    "it is promising and challenging since we do not know much of its property except a necessary condition @xcite .",
    "however , with the discovery of more and more 3d n - s steady states ( travelling waves ) numerically besides the upper and lower branches @xcite , it is unclear if any of these 3d steady states are fundamentally important to the development of transient turbulence . in theorem [ thm - catseye ] , we show that nontrivial 2d steady states bifurcate from the unstable shears @xmath36 under the 2d euler dynamics . since @xmath37 is arbitrarily close to the linear shear in the velocity variable , so we get inviscid steady states near the linear shear .",
    "these inviscid steady states could provide a natural starting point for constructing steady states of navier - stokes equation with large reynolds number .",
    "this is a problem of bifurcation from infinity or asymptotic bifurcation theory as suggested by yudovich @xcite . of course , to get n - s travelling waves from euler travelling waves , the key and difficult issue is to understand the boundary layers .    proving the existence of chaos ( turbulence ) for couette flow is a far more difficult problem than resolving the sommerfeld paradox .",
    "the boundary layer effect adds tremendously to the difficulty .",
    "the kolmogorov flow ( periodic boundary condition in every spatial dimension ) is a much easier mathematical problem in this aspect .",
    "the boundary layer is not present .",
    "some progress on the dynamical system studies on the kolmogorov flow has been made @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "so far , proving the existence of chaos in partial differential equations is only successful for simpler systems , for a survey , see @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section 2 , we will discuss some possible phase spaces in which dynamical system studies can be conducted on the couette flow . in section 3 ,",
    "we prove the inviscid linear instability of our sequence of oscillatory shears @xmath12 . in section 4",
    ", we prove the viscous linear instability of our sequence of oscillatory shears @xmath12 when viewed frozen . in section 5",
    ", we prove a bifurcation of our oscillatory shears @xmath12 to kelvin s cat s eyes under the 2d euler dynamics . in section 6 ,",
    "we prove the inviscid linear instability of 3d shears @xmath0 in a neighborhood of our oscillatory shears @xmath12 .",
    "we are interested in fluid flows between two infinite horizontal planes ( figure [ cflow ] ) where the upper plane moves with unit velocity and the lower plate is fixed .",
    "the dynamics of such a fluid flow is governed by the navier - stokes ( ns ) equations @xmath38 defined in the spatial domain @xmath39\\times\\mathbb{r}$ ] , where @xmath40 is the velocity , @xmath41 is the pressure , and @xmath24 is the inverse of the reynolds number @xmath42 .",
    "the following boundary condition identifies the specific flow @xmath43    @xmath44    the linear shear is given by @xmath45 one can choose the infinite dimensional phase space to be @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a local sobolev space .",
    "this phase space @xmath48 is too large and too difficult to analyze .",
    "one can first study its invariant subspace by posing extra periodic boundary condition along @xmath49 and @xmath50 directions with periods @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "moreover , in the two - dimensional case , the flow is nicer since both 2d ns and 2d euler equations are globally well - posed .    by the change of variables",
    "@xmath58 the new variable @xmath59 satisfies the dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath60 ; thus @xmath61 and @xmath62 is periodic in @xmath49 and @xmath50 . by this representation ,",
    "we see that the phase space @xmath57 is a banach manifold .",
    "in fact , the navier - stokes equations ( [ ns ] ) can be re - written in terms of the @xmath63 variable as @xmath64 where @xmath65 . in terms of @xmath66",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , due to the recent discovery of 3d steady states , there has been a conjecture on the explanation of the sommerfeld paradox using the stable manifolds of the 3d steady states .",
    "the stable manifolds can not be connected to the linear shear since it is linearly stable .",
    "the conjecture is that the stable manifolds can get close to the linear shear , which leads to the transition from the linear shear to turbulence @xcite .",
    "the main criticism on this argument is that these 3d steady states are quite far away from the linear shear even in the velocity variable .",
