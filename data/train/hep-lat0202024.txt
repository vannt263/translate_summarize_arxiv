    "the conventional approach of studying lattice hadronic correlation 2-point functions , @xmath0 , is to fit the large time , @xmath1 , interval of @xmath0 to an exponential , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the asymptotic state , and @xmath4 is the overlap of that state with the interpolating operator used .",
    "this method can be extended by including further exponentials , @xmath5 , which correspond to the lowest excited states of the channel in question .",
    "however , fundamentally , the small time part of the correlation function , @xmath6 , is always thrown away .",
    "this paper presents two approaches which are able to include the @xmath7 region of @xmath0 in the analysis .",
    "the first follows the approach of leinweber@xcite where a qcd sum rule technique is used to model the short time behaviour of @xmath0 .",
    "this is detailed in the next section where new results for non - degenerate mesons are presented , and in section 3 where these calculations are extended to include lattice artefacts coming from the wilson action .",
    "the second approach uses the `` maximum entropy method '' of numerical analysis to invert @xmath0 into its spectral function representation .",
    "section 4 describes this method and its application to the nambu  jona - lasinio model in ( 2 + 1)d .",
    "in @xcite a method was presented which combines two of the main non - perturbative approaches to strongly coupled field theory : the lattice and qcd sum rules .",
    "this section presents an overview of this approach and its extension to the case of non - degenerate mesons with non - zero momentum .",
    "the basic quantity considered is the short distance expansion ( ope ) of the quark propagator , @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the quark mass .",
    "the 2-point correlation function at zero momentum , @xmath0 , can be written as , @xmath11 or , wick contracting , as @xmath12 @xmath13 is a spinor matrix which defines the quantum numbers of the interpolating operator , @xmath14 , and thereby of the channel considered . in eq.([eq : g2 ] ) we have restricted our attention to mesons ( although in @xcite baryons were considered ) .",
    "the qcd sum rules approach ( and the method of @xcite ) substitutes the short distance expansion @xmath15 into the expression for @xmath16 in eq.([eq : g2 ] ) .",
    "this defines @xmath17 .",
    "we now introduce the spectral density , @xmath18 , which is defined via the laplace transform of @xmath0 , @xmath19 the spectral density , @xmath20 , corresponding to @xmath17 , is obviously valid for large values of @xmath21 ( i.e. short distances ) .",
    "we can not expect @xmath20 to reproduce the non - perturbative behaviour of qcd which generates bound states .",
    "the qcd sum rules `` continuum model '' allows for this by introducing a `` continuum threshold '' , @xmath22 , above which @xmath20 is assumed valid .",
    "the non - perturbative , confining features of the system are modelled with a delta function at @xmath23 .",
    "the full spectral function is , @xmath24 @xmath4 is the normalisation of the ground state whose mass is @xmath3 . and @xmath25 a parameter which takes account of the different normalisations of the lattice versus continuum states ( see @xcite ) .    for completeness",
    ", we write here the two - point function that eq.([eq : rho ] ) defines : @xmath26    the above method was first employed in the study of lattice data in @xcite where the analytic expressions for eq.([eq : g2_final ] ) were derived in the case of zero - momentum baryonic channels . in @xcite ,",
    "this work was extended to zero - momentum mesons and the continuum limit of the ansatz , eq.([eq : g2_final ] ) , was studied . in @xcite , we extend this approach still further by studying non - degenerate mesons at both momentum @xmath27 and @xmath28 . we show here the expression for @xmath17 in the case of the ( spatial ) vector channel at zero momentum .",
