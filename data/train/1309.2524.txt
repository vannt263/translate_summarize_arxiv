    "recall that a topological space @xmath0 is called _ paracompact _ if it is hausdorff , and each open covering admits a refinement that is locally finite .",
    "this notion was introduced by dieudonn @xcite as early as 1944 and has turned out to be extremely useful in general topology and sheaf theory .",
    "for example , godement showed that _ ech cohomology _ coincides with _ sheaf cohomology _ on paracompact spaces ( @xcite , theorem 5.10.1 ) .",
    "for general spaces , all that can be said is that there is a spectral sequence @xmath1 computing the `` true '' sheaf cohomology from the ech cohomology of the presheaves of sheaf cohomology ( loc .",
    ", theorem 5.9.1 ) .",
    "grothendieck observed that for many irreducible spaces , for example @xmath2 with the zariski topology , this spectral sequence does not degenerate for suitable @xmath3 , such that ech cohomology does not coincide with sheaf cohomology ( @xcite , page 178 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "artin @xcite established that for `` most '' separated schemes , ech cohomology agrees with sheaf cohomology when computed in the tale topology .",
    "although the known counterexamples are very common in the realm of algebraic geometry , they are perhaps not so natural from the standpoint of algebraic or general topology , since the spaces are not hausdorff . in my opinion , it would be desirable to have further counterexamples satisfying the hausdorff axiom , the more so in light of artin s result .",
    "the goal of this note is to provide such a space .",
    "the construction roughly goes as follows : we start with an infinite wedge sum @xmath4 of closed 2-disks , and replace the cw - topology at the intersection of the 2-disks by some coarser topology . this topology is choose fine enough to keep the space hausdorff , yet coarse enough so that a variant of grothendieck s argument holds true .",
    "it turns out that our space has other pathological features as well : the sheaf of continuous real - valued functions is neither soft nor acyclic .",
    "although the space is contractible , it carries nontrivial principal @xmath5-bundles .",
    "these are necessarily non - numerable , whence do not come from the universal bundle .",
    "we start by constructing an infinite 2-dimensional cw - complex @xmath0 .",
    "its 0-skeleton is a sequence @xmath6 , @xmath7 of 0-cells",
    ". the first 0-cell @xmath8 will play a special role throughout , and we shall call it the _ origin_. to form the 1-skeleton @xmath9 , we connect the origin to each @xmath6 , @xmath10 with two 1-cells called @xmath11 . to complete the construction , we choose homeomorphisms @xmath12 and use these as attaching maps for the 2-cells @xmath13 , @xmath10 .",
    "this gives an infinite 2-dimensional cw - complex @xmath0 , which one may visualize as follows .",
    "figure : the cw - complex @xmath0    being a cw - complex , the space @xmath0 is paracompact @xcite . with our goal in mind we now replace the cw - topology by some coarser topology : let @xmath14 be the collection of all subsets @xmath15 that are open in the cw - topology , and either do not contain the origin @xmath16 , or contain almost all subsets @xmath17 , which are closed 2-cells with a 0-cell removed .",
    "this collection of subsets obviously satisfies the axioms of a topology , and we call this topology @xmath14 the _ coarser topology_. here and throughout , almost all means all but finitely many .",
    "the set @xmath0 , endowed with the coarser topology , is denoted @xmath18 .",
    "[ hausdorff nonparacompact ] the space @xmath18 is hausdorff but not paracompact .    clearly , the identity map @xmath19 is continuous , and becomes a homeomorphism outside the origin .",
    "thus @xmath18 is hausdorff outside the origin @xmath16 . given @xmath20",
    ", we choose two disjoint open neighborhoods @xmath21 , @xmath22 on the cw - complex @xmath0 . by shrinking @xmath23",
    ", we may assume that @xmath23 intersects only one closed 2-cell . by enlarging @xmath24",
    ", we may assume that @xmath24 contains all remaining closed 2-cells , while staying disjoint from @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath25 are open in the coarse topology , thus @xmath18 is hausdorff .    to see that the space is not paracompact ,",
    "let @xmath26 be the complement of @xmath27 , and @xmath28 by the open subset @xmath29 .",
    "this gives an open covering @xmath30 .",
    "every refinement of this covering fails to be locally finite : for each @xmath10 , let @xmath31 be a member of such a refinement that contains @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , @xmath32 , whence the @xmath31 are pairwise different . by definition of the coarser topology , each neighborhood of the origin contains almost all @xmath17 , therefore intersects almost all @xmath31 .",
    "hence our space is not paracompact .",
    "the space @xmath18 is not _",
    "regular _ : consider the origin @xmath16 and the closed set @xmath33 .",
    "then every open neighborhood of @xmath16 intersects every open neighborhood of @xmath34 . on the other hand ,",
    "the space @xmath18 is _ pointwise paracompact _ , a property also called _ metacompactness _ : every open covering admits a refinement that is pointwise finite .",
    "clearly , each closed 2-cell @xmath35 is compact , hence @xmath36 is a countable union of compacta , in other words , our space is _",
    "@xmath37-compact_. in particular , it is _ lindelf _ , which means that every open covering has a countable subcovering .",
    "the reader may consult steen and seebach @xcite for other counterexamples in this direction .",
    "the _ kelley topology _ ( also called the _ compactly generated topology _ ) on a space @xmath38 consists of those subsets @xmath39 such that @xmath40 is open for each compact subset @xmath41 .",
    "this topology plays a role for infinite cw - complexes , for example , to define products .",
    "one easily checks that each compact subset @xmath42 is also compact with respect to the cw - topology . from this",
    "it follows that the kelley topology of @xmath36 coincides with the cw - topology .",
    "let @xmath3 be an abelian sheaf on a topological space @xmath38 .",
    "then one has sheaf cohomology groups @xmath43 , which are defined via global sections of injective resolutions , and ech cohomology groups @xmath44 , which are computed in terms of open coverings and local sections .",
    "the two types of cohomology groups are related by a spectral sequence @xmath45 . for details",
    ", we refer to grothendieck s exposition @xcite and godement s monograph @xcite . a basic fact in sheaf theory",
    "states that the canonical map @xmath46 is bijective , and we have a short exact sequence @xmath47 compare @xcite , page 177 .",
    "thus ech cohomology does not coincide with sheaf cohomology provided @xmath48 .",
    "our task is therefore to find such a situation .",
    "consider the cw - complex @xmath0 and the space @xmath18 constructed in the preceding section .",
    "the following fact will be useful :    [ cohomology coincides ] for each open subset @xmath49 , the sheaf cohomology groups @xmath50 , @xmath51 are the same , whether computed in the cw - topology or in the coarser topology .",
    "let @xmath52 be the identity map , which is continuous .",
    "we have a canonical map @xmath53 of abelian sheaves , where the left hand side is the sheaf of locally constant integer - valued functions on @xmath36 , and the right hand side is the direct image sheaf of the corresponding sheaf on @xmath0 .",
    "we first check that this map is bijective .",
    "the question is local on @xmath36 , and bijectivity is obvious outside the origin .",
    "injectivity holds because the mapping @xmath54 is surjective .",
    "since there are arbitrarily small open neighborhoods @xmath55 that are pathconnected and hence connected in the cw - topology , the canonical map @xmath56 is bijective as well .    in light of the leray ",
    "serre spectral sequence @xmath57 it suffices to check that @xmath58 for all @xmath59 .",
    "this is again local , and holds for trivial reasons outside the origin .",
    "since there are arbitrarily small open neighborhoods @xmath55 that are contractible in the cw - topology , and singular cohomology coincides with sheaf cohomology for cw - complexes ( @xcite , chapter iii , section 1 ) , vanishing holds at the origin as well .",
    "let @xmath15 be the complement of the 1-skeleton @xmath60 , that is , the union of all 2-cells , and @xmath61 be the abelian sheaf of locally constant integer - valued functions on @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , @xmath24 is open in the coarser topology .",
    "thus the inclusion map @xmath62 is continuous . from this",
    "we obtain an abelian sheaf @xmath63 on @xmath18 , called _",
    "extension by zero_. it is defined by the rule @xmath64 compare @xcite , expose i. its first cohomology is easily computed :    [ first cohomology ] let @xmath65 be an open subset with @xmath66",
    ". then we have a canonical identification @xmath67    the short exact sequence @xmath68 induces a long exact sequence @xmath69 and the result follows .    for this sheaf , ech cohomology does not coincide with sheaf cohomology , in a rather drastic way :    [ cohomology uncountable ] for the abelian sheaf @xmath70 on the topological space @xmath18 the group @xmath71 is uncountable . in particular , the inclusion @xmath72 is not bijective .",
    "let @xmath73 be an open covering of @xmath18 . by definition ,",
    "the corresponding group @xmath74 is the first cohomology of the complex @xmath75 here we employ the usual abbreviation @xmath76 et cetera .",
    "the coboundary maps are the usual one , for example  @xmath77 , and we have chosen a total order on the index set @xmath78 . by definition ,",
    "ech cohomology equals @xmath79 where the direct limit runs over all open coverings ordered by the refinement relation . for a precise definition of the maps in the direct system , and their well - definedness , we refer to @xcite , chapter ii , section 5.7 .    in general , it can be difficult to control such direct limits .",
    "however , one may restrict to open coverings forming a cofinal subsystem .",
    "therefore , we may assume that our open covering satisfies the following five additional assumptions : ( i ) each @xmath80 and the intersection @xmath81 are , if nonempty , contractible in the cw - topology .",
    "( ii ) each 0-cell is contained in precisely one @xmath80 .",
    "( iii ) if some @xmath80 contains a 0-cell @xmath6 , @xmath10 , then it is contained in the corresponding closed 2-cell @xmath82 . ( iv )",
    "we suppose that the index set @xmath78 is well - ordered .",
    "this allows us to regard the natural numbers @xmath83 as indices .",
    "after reindexing , we stipulate that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "( v ) finally , if a closed 2-cell @xmath82 is contained in @xmath86 , then it is disjoint from all other @xmath80 .    from now on ,",
    "we only consider open coverings @xmath87 satisfying these five condition .",
    "choose @xmath88 so that @xmath89 contains all @xmath17 , @xmath90 .",
    "condition ( i ) implies that for @xmath91 , @xmath90 we have @xmath66 , and furthermore @xmath92 the latter sitting diagonally in the former .",
    "note that this is the key step in grothendieck s argument @xcite , page 178 .",
    "now proposition [ first cohomology ] gives us an identification @xmath93 in light of proposition [ first cohomology ] , condition ( i ) ensures that the term on the left in the complex ( [ complex ] ) vanishes .",
    "condition ( ii ) and ( v ) tell us that the triple intersections @xmath94 are empty for @xmath90 and all indices @xmath95 .",
    "the upshot is that we have a canonical inclusion @xmath96 if @xmath97 is a refinement of @xmath87 satisfying the same five conditions , the induced map @xmath98 restricts to the canonical projection @xmath99 on the subgroups considered above , where we tacitly choose @xmath100 .",
    "since forming direct limits is exact , we obtain an inclusion @xmath101 again using that forming direct limits is exact , we may rewrite the left hand side as @xmath102 which is uncountable .",
    "we finally examine pathological properties of continuous functions and principal bundles on @xmath36 .",
    "let us write @xmath103 for the sheaf of continuous real - valued functions on @xmath36 .",
    "recall that ech cohomology agrees with sheaf cohomology in degree one .",
    "thus our task is to construct a nontrivial ech cohomology class . consider the open covering @xmath87 given by @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath10 .",
    "choose germs of continuous functions @xmath107 having an isolated zero at @xmath6 . then its reciprocal @xmath108 is defined on some open punctured neighborhood of @xmath85 , where it is necessarily unbounded . on the other hand , for any continuous function @xmath109",
    "there is some @xmath110 so that @xmath111 is bounded on @xmath112 .",
    "whence @xmath108 can not be written as the difference of continuous functions coming from @xmath89 and @xmath113 , for @xmath90 .",
    "the same applies for any refinement @xmath97 satisfying the five conditions formulated in the proof for theorem [ cohomology uncountable ] .",
    "the upshot is that for all refinements @xmath97 with @xmath114 sufficiently small , we obtain a well - defined tuple @xmath115 that is a cocycle whose class in @xmath116 is nonzero .",
    "recall that @xmath88 is any integer so that @xmath117 contains @xmath17 for all @xmath90 . since this holds for all such refinements @xmath97",
    ", it follows that the class in the direct limit @xmath118 is nonzero as well .    on normal spaces @xmath38",
    ", the uryson lemma ensures that the sheaf @xmath119 is _ soft _ , that is , the canonical map @xmath120 is surjective for all closed subsets @xmath34 , where @xmath121 denotes the inclusion map .",
    "according to @xcite , chapter ii , theorem 4.4.3 , soft sheaves on paracompact spaces @xmath38 are acyclic .    for our space @xmath36 , it is easy to check that the canonical map for the discrete closed subset @xmath122 is not surjective . summing up ,",
    "the sheaf of continuous real - valued functions on @xmath36 is neither soft nor acyclic .",
    "next consider the sheaf @xmath123 of continuous functions taking values in the circle group @xmath124 .",
    "it sits in the exponential sequence @xmath125 where the map on the right is @xmath126 . from this",
    "we get an exact sequence @xmath127 the outer terms vanish by lemma [ cohomology coincides ] , and we conclude that @xmath128 for all @xmath59 . from the preceding proposition",
    "we get @xmath129 . in other words , there are nontrivial principal @xmath5-bundles over @xmath36 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the following fact :      the cw - topology and the coarse topology induce the same topology on the compact subsets @xmath130 , which are thus homeomorphic to the 2-disk .",
    "choose homotopies @xmath131 between the identity and the constant map to the origin so that @xmath132 for all @xmath133 , and @xmath134 for all @xmath135 and all @xmath136 .",
    "the first condition ensures that the homotopies glue to a map @xmath137 , which is continuous with respect to the cw - topology . from the second condition one",
    "easily infers that it remains continuous when regarded as a map @xmath138 .",
    "thus @xmath139 is a homotopy from the identity on @xmath36 to the constant map @xmath140 .",
    "let @xmath141 be a topological group . recall that a @xmath141-principal bundle @xmath142 is called _ numerable _ if it can be trivialized on some numerable covering @xmath143 .",
    "the latter means that there is a partition of unity @xmath144 $ ] , @xmath145 so that the open covering @xmath1460,1])$ ] , @xmath145 is locally finite and refines the given covering @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "according to milnor s construction of the classifying space @xmath149 as a countable join @xcite , together with dold s analysis ( @xcite , section 7 and 8) , the isomorphism classes of numerable bundles correspond to the homotopy classes of continuous maps @xmath150 .",
    "we conclude :      non - numerable principal @xmath151-bundles based on a construction with the long line appear in @xcite .",
    "a non - numerable principal @xmath152-bundle over a non - hausdorff space is sketched in @xcite , page 350 .",
    "the results in this section hold true if one uses a simpler space , obtained by attaching only 1-cells @xmath153 and no 2-cells , rather than pairs of 1-cells @xmath11 and 2-cells @xmath13 .",
    "of course , the coarser topology is defined in the same way ."
