    "recently many - body systems with non - local , power - law interactions gained considerable interest as the non - local coupling can give rise to quantum phases that do not exist for point - like interactions @xcite .",
    "for example in one spatial dimension repulsive dipole - dipole or van der waals interactions of atoms can lead to a variety of crystalline ground state phases with less than unity filling in the presence of a commensurable periodic lattice @xcite .",
    "for very strong lattice confinements the filling fraction forms a so - called complete devils staircase as function of the chemical potential @xmath0 , i.e. every rational filling between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is stable for a finite interval of @xmath0 and these intervals form a dense staircase @xcite .",
    "power - law interactions arise e.g. for dipolar atoms or molecules @xcite .",
    "a very interesting alternative approach are rydberg gases for which there has been considerable experimental progress in the recent years @xcite .",
    "while most previous experiments implemented schemes where rydberg excitations were created by continuous near - resonant laser driving , alternative proposals have been put forward to use far - detuned light fields to admix a small component of a rydberg state to the ground state of atoms @xcite .",
    "the potential advantage of this `` rydberg - dressing '' is that the interaction strength can be tuned to a certain extend and is reduced to an energy scale where the center - of - mass motion of atoms can become relevant .",
    "furthermore continuous driving by a near - resonant laser does in general not conserve the number of rydberg excitations , while in the case of rydberg - dressing the number of atoms are to good approximation a conserved quantity .",
    "while the non - local repulsive interaction favors crystalline structures with non - unitary filling in lattice gases , hopping between lattice sites induced by tunnelling of the atoms can lead to a melting of the crystals @xcite .    in the present paper we analyse the melting process induced by hopping of rydberg - dressed atoms .",
    "in particular we derive the phase boundaries of stable crystalline structures as a function of the hopping amplitude @xmath3 both analytically and with exact numerical simulations . to this end",
    "we employ a second order strong coupling expansion on the one hand and numerical density - matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) simulations , adapted to long - range interactions , on the other .",
    "both show excellent agreement up to second order in @xmath3 .",
    "a corresponding strong - coupling analysis of the phase diagram has been discussed before for the case of dipolar @xmath4 interactions in @xcite , however no explicit expressions were given .",
    "we here derive analytic expressions which in the case of fast decaying potentials , such as the @xmath5 van der waals potential , can in very good approximation be written in a compact closed form .",
    "furthermore we provide for the first time a comparison to numerical data from dmrg simulations adapted to long - range interactions .    as a starting point",
    "we consider the generalised bose - hubbard model in one dimension @xmath6 for convenience we have set @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the lattice constant .",
    "@xmath9 are the annihilation and creation operators at site @xmath10 , and @xmath3 is the hopping amplitude between neighbouring lattice sites describing the tunnelling of atoms between adjacent lattice sites @xcite .",
    "most parts of our discussion are valid for any convex interaction potential , i.e @xmath11 however to be specific we discuss in the following power - law potentials of the form @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the interaction coefficients .",
    "@xmath15 corresponds to a van der waals type interaction which results from virtual ( i.e. off - resonant ) long - wavelength electromagnetic transitions in the manifold of rydberg states .",
    "if there is an accidental or engineered resonance , a so called frster resonance , also the case @xmath16 can be of relevance .",
    "the model interaction potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) diverges for @xmath17 and thus two particles can not sit on the same lattice site . to very good approximation",
    "the same is true if one considers the exact interaction potential between rydberg atoms which deviates from the above power law for small distances ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "in fact for the rydberg - dressing scheme one finds an effective two - body interaction potential between atoms at positions @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the rydberg interaction coefficient and @xmath22 describes a characteristic length scale of the interaction potential , where @xmath23 is an effective detuning of the off - resonant laser driving .",
    "@xmath24 accounts for the small admixture of the rydberg state .",
    "considering e.g. @xmath25rb with a rydberg state of principle quantum number around @xmath26 and detunings of a few tens of mhz one finds a value of @xmath27 on the order of one to a few @xmath0 m . in a recent experiment atoms",
    "were loaded into optical lattices and excited to rydberg states with @xmath28 @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the lattice spacing was tunable between @xmath29 m and @xmath30 m .",
    "thus the cut - off length @xmath27 may become smaller than the average distance between particles given by the lattice constant devided by the average occupation number per lattice site . in this case",

    "the hamiltonian is diagonal in the number basis , where each lattice site contains exactly zero or exactly one particle , which corresponds to a classical situation .",
    "consequently the energy can be minimised just by finding the configuration of classical particles that gives the smallest interaction energy . as the interaction potential is convex ( see equation ( [ eq : convex ] ) ) , the minimum energy for commensurable filling fractions @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are relatively prime , is attained by a regular pattern with unit cells of size @xmath37 @xcite . for a given chemical potential",
    "the ground state is such a phase with rational @xmath38 . for these values of @xmath38",
