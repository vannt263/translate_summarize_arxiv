    "in the solar system , the planetary orbits are well - aligned and prograde , revolving in the same direction as the rotation of the sun .",
    "this fact inspired the `` nebular hypothesis '' that the sun and planets formed from a single spinning disk ( laplace 1796 ) .",
    "one might also expect exoplanetary orbits to be well - aligned with their parent stars , and indeed this is true of most systems for which it has been possible to compare the directions of orbital motion and stellar rotation ( fabrycky & winn 2009 , le bouquin et al .",
    ". however , there are at least 3 exoplanets for which the orbit is tilted by a larger angle than any of the planets in the solar system : xo-3b ( hbrard et al .  2008 , winn et al .",
    "2009a ) , hd  80606b ( moutou et al .",
    "2009 , pont et al .",
    "2009 , winn et al .",
    "2009b ) , and wasp-14b ( johnson et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "still , all of those systems are consistent with prograde orbits , with the largest minimum angle between the stellar - rotational and orbital angular momentum vectors of about 37@xmath0 , for xo-3b ( winn et al .",
    "the reason why only the _ minimum _ angle is known is that the evidence for misalignment is based on the eponymous effect of rossiter ( 1924 ) and mclaughlin ( 1924 ) , an anomalous doppler shift observed during planetary transits that is sensitive only to the angle between the _ sky projections _ of the two vectors .",
    "the true spin - orbit angle may be larger , depending on the unknown inclination angle of the stellar rotation axis with respect to the line of sight .    in this letter we present evidence of a very large spin - orbit misalignment for hat - p-7b , a planet of mass 1.8  @xmath2 and radius 1.4  @xmath3 in a 2.2-day orbit around an f6v star with mass 1.5  @xmath4 and radius 1.8  @xmath5 ( pl et al .",
    "we find the angle between the sky - projected angular momentum vectors to be @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore we show that the true angle @xmath6 between those vectors is likely greater than @xmath7 , indicating that the orbit is either retrograde ( @xmath8 ) or nearly polar ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we also present evidence for a third body in the system , which may be an additional planet or a companion star .",
    "we present spectroscopic data in   2 , photometric data in   3 , a joint analysis of both types of data in   4 , and a discussion of the results in   5 .",
    "we observed hat - p-7 with the high resolution spectrograph ( hires ) on the keck  i 10 m telescope , and the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) on the subaru  8 m telescope .",
    "the planet s discoverers ( pl et al .  2008 ; hereafter , p08 ) obtained 8 hires spectra in 2007 , to which we add 9 spectra from 2009 .",
    "all but one of the hires spectra were acquired outside of transits . of the 49 hds spectra , 9 were obtained on 2009  june  17 and 40 were obtained on 2009  july  1 .",
    "the second of these nights spanned a transit .",
    "the instrument settings and observing procedures in both 2007 and 2009 were identical to those used by the california planet search ( cps ; howard et al .",
    "we placed an iodine gas absorption cell into the optical path , to calibrate the instrumental response and wavelength scale .",
    "the radial velocity ( rv ) of each spectrum was measured with respect to an iodine - free template spectrum , using the algorithm of butler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) with subsequent improvements .",
    "measurement errors were estimated from the scatter in the fits to individual spectral segments spanning a few angstroms .",
    "the rvs are given in table  1 .",
    "1 shows the rvs over the 2  yr span of the observations .",
    "2 shows the rvs as a function of orbital phase , fitted with 2 different models .",
    "the first model is a single keplerian orbit , representing the signal of the known planet .",
    "the second model has an additional parameter @xmath10 representing an extra radial acceleration .",
    "the second model gives a better fit to the data , with a root - mean - squared ( rms ) residual of 7  m  s@xmath11 as compared to 21  m  s@xmath11 for the first model .",
    "the rvs from 2009 are systematically redshifted by approximately 40  m  s  @xmath11 compared to rvs from 2007 , as evident from the residuals shown in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 2(b ) .",
    "this shift is highly significant , as the cps has demonstrated a long - term stability of 2  m  s@xmath11 or better using hires and the same reduction codes used here ( howard et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "this rv trend is evidence for an additional companion .",
    "given the limited time coverage of our observations ( two clusters of points separated by 2  yr ) , the data are compatible with nearly any period longer than a few months .",
    "a constant acceleration is the simplest model that fits the excess rv variability , and under that assumption we may give an order - of - magnitude relation relating @xmath10 to some properties of the companion , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the companion mass , @xmath14 its orbital inclination relative to the line of sight , @xmath15 its orbital distance , and the numerical value is based on our model - fitting results ( see   4 ) .",
    "3(a ) shows the rv data spanning the transit , after subtracting the orbital rv as computed with the best - fitting model including @xmath10 .",
    "we interpret the `` anomalous '' rv variation during the transit as the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect , the asymmetry in the spectral lines due to the partial eclipse of the rotating photosphere . in the context of eclipsing binary stars ,",
    "the rm effect was predicted by holt  ( 1893 ) and observed definitively by rossiter  ( 1924 ) and mclaughlin  ( 1924 ) . for exoplanets ,",
    "the rm effect was first observed by queloz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and its use in assessing spin - orbit alignment has been expounded by ohta et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and gaudi & winn ( 2007 ) .",
    "a transiting planet in a well - aligned prograde orbit would first pass in front of the blueshifted ( approaching ) half of the star , causing an anomalous redshift of the observed starlight .",
    "then , the planet would cross to the redshifted ( receding ) half of the star , causing an anomalous blueshift . in contrast ,",
    "3(a ) shows a blueshift followed by a redshift : an inversion of the effect just described .",
    "we may conclude , even without any modeling , that the orbital `` north pole '' and the stellar `` north pole '' point in nearly opposite directions on the sky .",
    "for a quantitative analysis of the rm effect we wanted to model both the photometric and spectroscopic transit signals . for this purpose we supplemented the rv data with the most precise transit light curve available to us , shown in fig .",
    "this light curve is based on observations on ut  2008  sep  22 in the sloan @xmath16 bandpass , with the fred l.  whipple 1.2 m telescope and keplercam detector , under the auspices of the transit light curve project ( holman et al .",
    "2006 , winn et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "reduction of the ccd images involved standard procedures for bias subtraction and flat - field division .",
    "differential aperture photometry was performed for hat - p-7 and 7 comparison stars .",
    "no evidence was found for time - correlated noise using the `` time - averaging '' method of pont et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , as implemented by winn et al .",
    "( 2009c ) . the data shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) were corrected for differential extinction as explained in   4 .",
    "we fitted a model to the photometric and rv data in order to derive quantitative constraints on the angle @xmath17 between the sky projections of the orbital and stellar - rotational angular momentum vectors .",
    "this angle is defined such that @xmath18 when the sky - projected vectors are parallel and @xmath19 when they are antiparallel .",
    "our model for the rm effect was based on the technique of winn et al .",
    "( 2005 ) : we simulated spectra exhibiting the rm effect at various transit phases , and then measured the apparent rv of the simulated spectra using the same doppler code that is used on actual data .",
    "this allowed us to relate the anomalous rv to the parameters and positions of the star and planet .",
    "the rv model was the sum of the keplerian rv and the anomalous rv due to the rm effect .",
    "the photometric model was based on the analytic equation for the flux of a quadratically limb - darkened disk with a circular obstruction ( mandel & agol 2002 ) . as a compromise between fixing the limb - darkening coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 at theoretically calculated values , and giving them complete freedom , we fixed @xmath22 at the tabulated value of 0.3846 ( claret 2004 ) and allowed @xmath23 to be a free parameter .",
    "we also included a free parameter for the coefficient of differential airmass extinction between hat - p-7 and the ensemble of comparison stars .",
    "we determined the best values of the model parameters and their 68.3% confidence limits using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm , as described in our previous works ( see , e.g. , winn et al .",
    "the likelihood function was given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 ^ 2 +           \\sum_{i=1}^{n_v } \\left [ \\frac{v_i({\\mathrm{obs } } ) - v_i({\\mathrm{calc}})}{\\sigma_{v , i } } \\right]^2,\\ ] ] in a self - explanatory notation , with @xmath26 chosen to be 0.00136 , and @xmath27 chosen to be the quadrature sum of the rv measurement error and a `` stellar jitter '' term of 9.3  m  s@xmath11 .",
    "these choices led to @xmath28 for the minimum-@xmath29 model .",
    "a gaussian prior constraint was imposed upon the orbital period based on the precise measurement of p08 .",
    "table  2 gives the results for the model parameters .",
    "in particular , the result for @xmath17 is @xmath30  deg , close to antiparallel , as anticipated from the qualitative discussion of   2 .",
    "our finding for @xmath17 is strongly suggestive of retrograde motion , in which the orbital motion and stellar rotation are in opposite directions .",
    "however , it must be remembered that @xmath17 refers to the angle between the _ sky - projected _ angular momentum vectors .",
    "the true angle @xmath6 between the vectors is given by @xmath31 where @xmath16 and @xmath32 are the line - of - sight inclinations of the orbital and stellar angular momentum vectors , respectively .",
    "although @xmath16 is known precisely from the transit data , @xmath32 is unknown .    supposing @xmath32 to be drawn from an `` isotropic '' distribution ( uniform in @xmath33 ) , the data demand that @xmath34 with 99.73% confidence .",
    "thus , under this assumption , a retrograde orbit is strongly favored , although a nearly - polar and barely - prograde orbit can not be ruled out .",
    "in fact there is circumstantial evidence that @xmath32 is small and consequently the orbit of hat - p-7b is nearly polar ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the star s projected rotation rate is unusually low for such a hot star : @xmath36  km  s@xmath11 in our model , or @xmath37  km  s@xmath11 based on the line profile analysis of p08 ; and @xmath38  k according to p08 . in the spocs catalog of dwarf stars with well - determined spectroscopic properties ( valenti & fischer 2005 ) , only 2 of 37 stars with @xmath39  k",
    "have @xmath40  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "based on this catalog , the mean rotation rate @xmath41 for such hot stars is about 15  km  s@xmath11 . as an alternate approach to constraining @xmath6 , we assumed the rotation velocity @xmath41 is drawn from a gaussian distribution with mean 15  km  s@xmath11 and standard deviation 3  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the result is @xmath42  deg with 68.3% confidence , and @xmath43 with 99.73% confidence .",
    "this analysis favors nearly - polar and retrograde orbits .",
    "however , one wonders whether hat - p-7 should be expected to have a `` typical '' rotation rate , given the existence of its short - period planet on a bizarre orbit .",
    "another caveat is that we found the scaled semimajor axis @xmath44 to be about 1@xmath45 smaller than the finding of p08 , suggesting the star is somewhat larger and more evolved , which would correspond to a slower expected rotation rate .",
    "determining @xmath32 directly may be possible by measuring and interpreting asteroseismological oscillations ( gizon & solanki 2003 ) , or photometric modulations produced by starspots ( see , e.g. , henry & winn 2008 ) . by good fortune ,",
    "hat - p-7 is in the field of view of the _ kepler _ satellite , which is capable of precise long - term photometry and may be able to accomplish these tasks ( borucki et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the extraordinary orbit of hat - p-7b presents an extreme case for theories of planet formation and subsequent orbital evolution .",
    "hat - p-7b is a `` hot jupiter '' and presumably migrated inward toward the star after its formation .",
    "a prevailing migration theory involves tidal interactions with the protoplanetary disk , but such interactions would probably not perturb the initial coplanarity of the system , and might even bring the system into closer alignment ( lubow & ogilvie 2001 , cresswell et al .",
    "more promising to explain hat - p-7b are scenarios involving few - body dynamics , as those scenarios are expected to produce misalignments . in one scenario ,",
    "close encounters between planets throw a planet inward , where its orbit is ultimately shrunk and circularized by tidal dissipation ( chatterjee et al .",
    "2008 , juri & tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "another idea is based on the kozai ( 1962 ) effect , whereby the gravitational force from a distant body on a highly inclined orbit strongly modulates an inner planet s orbital eccentricity and inclination ( fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ) .",
    "recent calculations showed that a combination of planet - planet scattering , the kozai effect , and tidal friction can lead to nearly - circular retrograde orbits ( nagasawa et al .",
    "a third proposed scenario involves an inward - migrating outer planet that captures an inner planet into a mean motion resonance ; if the inner planet avoids being ejected or consumed by the star , it may be released on a nearly - circular retrograde orbit ( yu & tremaine 2001 ) .    the prospect of explaining hat - p-7b s orbit through few - body dynamics lends extra importance to measuring the mass and orbital parameters of the third body .",
    "if it turns out to be a planet , then hat - p-7b will be only the second known case of a transiting planet accompanied by another planet , the first being hat - p-13b ( bakos et al .  2009 ) .",
    "such systems are highly desirable because the unusually precise measurements enabled by transit observations can be used to determine whether the orbits are coplanar and give clues about the system s dynamical history ( fabrycky 2009 ) .",
