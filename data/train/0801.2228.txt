    "small submicron particles are well - suited as fillers in non - conducting polymer matrices to obtain a conducting composite with a percolation threshold ( far ) below 1 % .",
    "the low percolation threshold is due to the formation of airy aggregates of conducting particles , in which the particles are grown together by diffusion - limited cluster aggregation , creating a network with a fractal dimension around 1.7 .",
    "@xcite these airy aggregates can be thought of as conducting spheres forming a 3-dimensional percolating network around the expected aggregate filling fraction 0.16 . as a consequence of the fractal structure within the aggregates ,",
    "the filler fraction of the particles at the percolation point is much lower . even in case",
    "the particles touch , the dc conductivity ( @xmath0 ) of these composites at high filling fractions turns out to be orders of magnitude lower than of the bulk material , as was recently illustrated for a particular crosslinked epoxy composite with filler particles of phthalcon-11 , @xcite co phthalocyanine crystallites of 100 nm size , and explained by purely structural arguments.@xcite    when crystalline particles with a diameter of less than 10 nm instead of 100 nm are used , the small size of the particles may impose another important restriction to the maximal possible composite conductivity , which is due to the density of states ( dos ) involved in the dc conductivity through the network of particle contacts .",
    "compared to larger crystallites , this dos can be strongly reduced by the charging energy.@xcite    we show how those microscopic parameters , which govern the charge - transport process across many decades of length scales , can accurately and consistently be determined by ac ( alternating current ) dielectric spectroscopy from a few hz to infrared frequencies .",
    "in particular we can address the parameters for mott variable - range hopping , for heterogeneity - induced enhanced ac response , for phonon- or photon - assisted nearest - neighbor hopping , and for the drude response of individual nanocrystals . due to these quantitative results",
    "we can unambiguously determine also the role of the nanocrystal charging energy in limiting the hopping process .",
    "we apply the method to antimony - doped tin - oxide ( ato ) crystallites of 7 nm diameter and to 100 nm sized crystallites of phthalcon-11 .",
    "it turns out that in densely packed crystallites of ato , due to the strong influence of the charging energy on the dos , @xmath0 at room temperature is four orders of magnitude lower than the dc conductivity extrapolated from the drude plasma frequency ( @xmath1 ) of the crystallites - a result with obvious implications for the design of conducting composites .",

    "this shows that on purely geometrical grounds for a network with @xmath14 , at the highest filling fraction of the aggregates @xmath0 will be three to four orders of magnitude lower than in the pure filler powder .",
    "@xcite    as remarked in the introduction , when nanosized particles are used as fillers , charging energies ( and quantum size effects ) impose a further important restriction to the maximal possible composite conductivity.@xcite this effect can be conveniently studied in densely packed powders of filler material by dielectric spectroscopy .      in the ohmic regime ,",
    "if there is a non - negligible density of states around the chemical potential , and the temperature @xmath15 is high enough that also the coulomb interaction can be neglected ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath0 will obey mott s equation for conduction via variable - range hopping ( vrh ) : @xcite @xmath17   \\label{esm}\\ ] ] with @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the decay length of the electron density , @xmath21 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath22 the density of states relevant in the hopping process .",

    "the very low number of carriers involved in the hopping process is similar to the number of carriers that determines the drude contribution in the crystallites .",
    "since the mean size of the particles is 20 times larger than for ato , the charging energies will be of the order of 3 mev , and hence are expected to be negligible at room temperature .      in polymer nanocomposites with building blocks formed by diffusion - limited cluster aggregation",

    "@xcite as shown by extended x - ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy ( exafs ) the resistive change after the intense laser recording pulse goes together with a crystallization process , where also small domains are inherently present .",
    "our dielectric method might visualize to what extent the domain walls after crystallization limit the conductivity and have consequences for the band structure calculations .",
    "if the walls become real barriers quantum size effects in the small domains will invalidate the use of periodic boundary conditions in the calculations .",
    "also the glassy behavior in the conductance of deposited indium - tin oxide samples in the insulating regime , @xcite and of quench - condensed insulating granular metals @xcite might be further clarified by the use of our dielectric approach and analysis .",
    "scanning the frequency will reveal the evolution of the length scales and dos involved in the relaxation processes .",
    "by combining data of sub - thz transmission with infrared transmission and reflection we were able to explain the full frequency response of densely - packed nanosized crystallites using the parameters for mott variable - range hopping , for heterogeneity - induced enhanced ac response , for phonon- or photon - assisted nearest - neighbor hopping , and for the drude response of individual nanocrystals . for 7",
    "nm antimony - doped tin - oxide particles the analysis unambiguously quantified the reduction of the density of states involved in the dc conduction compared to the value extrapolated from the drude response at infrared frequencies .",
