    "data analysis is an important procedure for most numerical projects and experiments . in lattice qcd ,",
    "the theory we fit to hadronic two point correlation function is : @xmath0 however , the general minimum @xmath1 procedure does not work for such a full physics hypothesis as the procedure is singular .",
    "what we used to do is to truncate both data set and theory .",
    "we might fit only the large-@xmath2 behavior with the lowest mass particle .",
    "numerically , the minimizing procedure is equivalent to a linear equation .",
    "suppose @xmath3 is an unknown parameter vector @xmath4    a singularity can occur due to the fact that matrix @xmath5 has is degenerate or has zero eigenvalues .",
    "a possible solution to the singularity is to add another matrix @xmath6 .",
    "suppose there is another minimizing procedure @xmath7 , @xmath8 we can minimize @xmath9 instead of @xmath10 .",
    "bayesian statistics provides a useful way to offer such an additional minimizing procedure .",
    "the parameter vector @xmath11 describes the hypothesis of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . to get @xmath11 from the measured data set",
    "@xmath12 is a numerical _ inverse _ problem .",
    "the bayesian theorem tells us that @xcite : a single good inverse @xmath13 , is to maximize the probability @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a prior set of the hypothesis and @xmath16 is the bayesian prior probability .    maximizing the entropy of @xmath11 under @xmath17",
    ", @xmath18 gives : @xmath19 so the bayesian theorem tells us that a single good inverse @xmath11 is to minimize @xmath20 @xcite@xcite . here",
    "the @xmath21 plays the role of the additional minimizing term @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) with @xmath23 .",
    "in principle , minimizing @xmath10 and minimizing @xmath22 would not necessarily give the same solution of @xmath11 . hereby , multiplier vector @xmath24 is a bridge from the solution of minimizing @xmath25 to the solution of minimizing @xmath26 . with @xmath23",
    "the constrained data modeling always introduces some systematic bias which depends on how the input priors match the unknown hypothesis . in some of the cases",
    "if we know the physics very well , we can `` teach the physics in fitting procedure '' .",
    "that means to input the priors according to our knowledge to the hypothesis @xcite .",
    "however , in some of the cases we do not know the hypothesis well , only the measured data set @xmath12 can tell us the information both of the priors and hypothesis . we should not simply maximize the probability @xmath27 to get the priors @xmath15 , since that violates bayesian theorem . instead",
    ", we can consider to use a subset of the measured data .",
    "in bayesian statistics when some data set @xmath28 comes along , and then some additional data set @xmath29 comes again , the probability of @xmath11 in these two cases will be @xcite : @xmath30 one can then prove the estimate of @xmath11 probability in a enlarged data set : @xmath31 which shows that we would have the same answer if all the data @xmath32 had been taken together .",
    "furthermore , we can get the priors from data set @xmath28 then to fit @xmath11 from @xmath32 taken together .",
    "that will not violate the bayesian theorem .",
    "so we can construct a real empirical baye s method to make data modeling .",
    "all the information comes from measured data set , without any additional artificial bias .",
