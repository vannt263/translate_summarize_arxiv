    "much recent activity in lattice qcd has focused on the determination of low - energy constants ( lecs ) , which parameterise non - perturbative physics in an effective description at low energies .",
    "a promising approach involves computing in the @xmath2regime , the kinematical region of arbitrarily small quark masses @xmath3 in a finite volume @xmath4 such that @xmath5 . here",
    "discretisations that preserve chiral symmetry at non - zero lattice spacing should be used so that small masses and momenta can be reached safely .",
    "however , simulations in the @xmath2-regime are expensive : owing to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking the spectrum of the dirac operator becomes arbitrarily dense near the origin , and thus the operator is ill - conditioned .",
    "furthermore , one observes large statistical fluctuations ( `` spikes '' ) in correlation functions of local currents @xcite for small masses .",
    "a number of efficient numerical tools have been developed @xcite , in which the low modes of the dirac operator are treated exactly . in ref.@xcite",
    "we proposed a method , dubbed `` low - mode averaging '' ( lma ) , which was shown to eliminate the spikes in two - point correlation functions for quark masses @xmath6 . here",
    "we report on the extension of lma to three - point correlation functions , in order to study non - leptonic kaon decays .",
    "we consider the massive neuberger operator @xcite d_m = ( 1-m)d+m,=a/(1+s ) , where @xmath7 is a free parameter and the massless neuberger operator , @xmath8 , satisfies the ginsparg - wilson relation .",
    "we are interested in correlation functions of the left - handed flavour current [ j_]_=(__p_- _ ) , p_=(1_5 ) , where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are flavour indices . using",
    "the left - handed current has the advantage that zero modes of the dirac operator are projected out in correlation functions .",
    "however , modes corresponding to small non - zero eigenvalues can still cause large statistical fluctuations .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the quark propagator from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "lma works by separating @xmath14 low - lying modes and using the spectral representation of the propagator . in this way",
    "the quark propagator is written as s(x , y)= _ k=1^n_low + s^h(x , y ) , [ eq_sxy ] where @xmath15 is the propagator in the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by the @xmath16 lowest modes .",
    "the vector @xmath17 is given by e_k = p_u_k+ p_-d p_u_k , where @xmath18 denotes the chirality of the sector containing zero modes ( if any ) , and @xmath19 is an approximate eigenmode of @xmath20 : p_d_m^d_m p_u_k = _ k u_k + r_k , ( u_k , r_i)=0 . after inserting the rhs . of into the expression for the correlator @xmath21 ,",
    "one picks up three contributions : c(t ) = c^ll(t)+c^hl(t)+c^hh(t ) .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the statistical signal for the correlator is enhanced by exploiting translational invariance in @xmath22 and @xmath23 , so that these contributions are sampled over many different source points .",
    "applications of lma to the calculation of @xmath24 in the @xmath2-regime can be found in @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we proposed a strategy to investigate the origins of the @xmath1 rule in @xmath25 decays , i.e. the observed enhancement of the transition amplitude for a two - pion final state with isospin  0 , @xmath26 .",
    "the goal of our programme is to quantify separately the contributions to the @xmath1 rule from physics at the charm quark mass scale and from `` intrinsic '' qcd effects due to soft - gluon exchange .",
    "a crucial part of our strategy is to keep an active charm quark , so that the theory has an approximate @xmath27 chiral symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 effective weak hamiltonian after the operator product expansion contains the four - quark operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 which are given by & & _ 1^= ( _ p_- ) ( _ p_- ) ( _ p_- ) ( _ p_- ) + & & - ( uc ) .",
    "[ eq_q1pm_def ] @xmath30 and @xmath31 are singlets under @xmath32 and transform under irreducible representations of @xmath33 of dimensions 84 and 20 , respectively .    in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , the ratio of amplitudes @xmath34 is , at leading order , related to a ratio of lecs via = ( + ) . here",
    ", the lecs @xmath35 multiply the counterparts of the four - quark operators @xmath36 in the low - energy theory .",
    "they can be determined by studying suitable correlation functions of @xmath36 in qcd and matching them to the corresponding expressions in chpt .",
    "the fact that in the @xmath2-regime this matching can be performed at nlo without the presence of additional interaction terms with unknown coefficients @xcite , makes this an attractive setting for carrying out our programme .",
    "the intrinsic qcd contributions to the enhancement can be isolated by determining @xmath37 in the theory with @xmath38 . then , by studying the ratio of lecs as @xmath39 departs from the mass - degenerate limit , the specific contribution of the charm quark to the @xmath1 rule can be investigated in detail .    the complicated renormalisation and mixing patterns of four - fermion operators usually encountered in lattice formulations can be avoided through the use of ginsparg - wilson fermions .",
    "indeed , the use of the modified fields @xmath40 in guarantees that the renormalisation and mixing of @xmath36 are like in the continuum theory @xcite . in particular , no mixings with lower - dimensional operators can occur .",
    "for full details we refer the reader to ref .",
    "an investigation of the effects of the charm quark based on chpt has been published in @xcite .",
    "we now report on our attempts to extract the ratio @xmath37 in the su(4)-symmetric theory . in this case",
    "only `` figure-8''-graphs must be considered , since `` eye''-graphs cancel exactly for @xmath41 .",
    "we define the following three - point functions of @xmath36 and the left - handed flavour current : c_1^(x_0,y_0 ) = _ , _ du [ _ 1^(0 ) ] [ j_0(y)]_us .",
    "the relation between @xmath37 and the ratio of correlators is given by h(x_0,y_0 ) = .",
    "|_ren , [ eq_g1pm_r2 ] where the factor @xmath42 has been computed in chpt in the @xmath2-regime at nlo @xcite .",
    "the factors @xmath43 are wilson coefficients , and it is assumed that @xmath44 is renormalised in some scheme",
    ". from one sees that the ratio of correlators is directly proportional to the ratio of lecs .",
    "our main results were obtained from 638 configurations on a lattice of size @xmath45 at @xmath46 , using the 5 lowest modes in the implementation of lma for figure-8 graphs . in fig.[fig_20over84 ] we plot the ratio @xmath44 as a function of the quark mass in units of @xmath47 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath44 increases as the quark mass is tuned towards smaller values , which , at first sight , might be interpreted as an enhancement in the ratio of lecs from qcd effects alone .",
    "however , the quark masses used in the simulations are too heavy to lie inside the @xmath2-regime , so that the computed nlo matching factor @xmath42 can not be applied to yield @xmath37 . for smaller masses",
    "the statistical signal for the ratio of three - point functions was lost even with lma .    in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our strategy one has to find ways of obtaining a strong signal in the @xmath2-regime .",
    "we have thus investigated the quality of the signal for three - point functions using lma with a larger number of low modes @xcite .",
    "preliminary results on a lattice of size @xmath48 at @xmath49 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_boot ] , where we have plotted the bootstrap distributions for the ratio of three - point functions @xmath44 .",
    "the plot shows that using @xmath50 hardly improves the signal at all , while for @xmath51 the distribution is much narrower , so that the statistical signal is indeed enhanced .",
    "we conclude that lma leads to an improvement also for three - point functions , but only if @xmath16 is increased relative to the previously studied case of two - point correlators .",
    "obviously , using larger values of @xmath16 leads to a computational overhead , which , however , is outweighed by far through the observed enhancement of the signal .",
    "we are currently running on larger spatial volumes in order to corroborate these findings .",
