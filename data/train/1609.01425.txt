    "let @xmath1 be a vertex weight of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath1 is a function from @xmath13 to the set of positive real numbers . in this case",
    ", we say that @xmath0 is a graph with a vertex weight @xmath1 .",
    "a vertex weight @xmath1 could be a constant function . in this case ,",
    "we say @xmath0 is @xmath1-regular .",
    "namely , @xmath0 is @xmath1-regular if for any @xmath14 , @xmath15 . observe that a well - known vertex weight of a graph is the vertex degree assigning to each vertex its degree .",
    "let us denote it by @xmath16 .",
    "the diagonal matrix of order @xmath17 whose @xmath18-entry is @xmath19 is called the diagonal vertex weight matrix of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 and is denoted by @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath22 of @xmath0 is a @xmath23-matrix defined by @xmath24 if and only if the vertices @xmath25 and @xmath26 are adjacent .",
    "then the matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 are called laplacian and signless laplacian matrix of @xmath0 , respectively ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these matrices was generalized for arbitrary vertex weighted graphs ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simple graph with the vertex weight @xmath1 .",
    "then we shall call the matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 the weighted laplacian and the weighted signless laplacian matrix of @xmath0 with respect to the vertex weight @xmath1 .",

    "mean absolute deviation _",
    "( often called the mean deviation ) @xmath32 and variance @xmath33 of @xmath34 is defined as    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the arithmetic mean of the distribution .",
    "note that an easy application of the cauchy - schwarz inequality gives that the mean deviation is a lower bound on the standard deviation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath37    the mean deviation and variance of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , is defined as    @xmath40    it follows from eq . that @xmath41 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath42 is well - investigated graph invariant ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath43 be eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix @xmath4 of graph @xmath0 .",
    "it is known that @xmath44 .",
    "the notion of the energy @xmath45 of an @xmath12-graph @xmath0 was introduced by gutman in connection with the @xmath46-molecular energy ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is defined as    @xmath47    for details of the theory of graph energy see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath48 be eigenvalues of laplacian matrix @xmath49 of graph @xmath0 .",

    "gutman and zhou defined the laplacian energy of an @xmath12-graph @xmath0 for the first time ( see @xcite ) as    @xmath51    numerous results on the laplacian energy have been obtained , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that in the definition of laplacian energy @xmath52 is the average vertex degree of @xmath0 .",
    "this motivates us to extend their definition to the graphs equipped with an arbitrary vertex weight .",

    "then we @xcite proposed the laplacian energy @xmath55 of @xmath0 with respect to the vertex weight @xmath1 as    @xmath56    where    @xmath57    note that @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph with an arbitrary vertex weight @xmath1 .",
    "some inequalities between @xmath45 and @xmath55 were established in @xcite ; and therein , the following three theorems were proved .",

    "having a molecule , if we represent atoms by vertices and bonds by edges , we obtain a molecular graph .",
    "graph theoretic invariants of molecular graphs , which predict properties of the corresponding molecule , are known as topological indices .",
    "the oldest topological index is the wiener index , which was introduced in 1947 . since then several topological indices have been proposed to predict characteristics of chemical compounds , like physio - chemical , pharmacologic , toxicological and other biological properties . in this article",
    "we deals with wiener index , total eccentricity index and first zagreb index .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected graph .",
    "given two vertices @xmath62 and @xmath63 in @xmath13 , the distance between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , denoted by @xmath64 is the length of a shortest path connecting them . the wiener index @xmath65 of a connected graph @xmath0 is defined to be the sum of distances between any two unordered pair of vertices of @xmath0 , i.e. ,    @xmath66 the transmission @xmath67 of a vertex @xmath63 is defined to be the sum of the distances from @xmath63 to all other vertices in @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath68 it is clear that @xmath69 a connected graph @xmath0 is said to be @xmath70-transmission regular if @xmath71 for every vertex @xmath72 .",
    "the transmission regular graphs are exactly the distance - balanced graphs introduced in @xcite .",
    "they are also called self - median graphs @xcite .",
    "we may consider the transmission of an arbitrary vertex as a vertex weight with the average @xmath73 . in this point of view",
    ", it follows from that              first zagreb index of a graph @xmath0 is defined as @xmath78 for a graph @xmath0 , denote by @xmath79 the 2-degree of vertex @xmath62 , which is the sum of the degrees of the vertices adjacent to @xmath62 ; a graph is said to be 2-degree regular if @xmath79 is constant for each @xmath62 .",
    "it is known that @xmath80              let us define @xmath86 , the square vertex degree of @xmath62 .",
    "so we may consider @xmath87 as a vertex weight of @xmath0 with the average @xmath88 . from this point of view , a graph is square vertex degree regular if and only if it is vertex degree regular . in this point of view",
    ", it follows from that              the eccentricity @xmath93 of the vertex @xmath62 of a connected graph @xmath0 is the distance from @xmath62 to any vertex farthest away from it in @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "the maximum eccentricity over all vertices of @xmath0 is called the diameter of @xmath0 and is denoted by @xmath95 ; the minimum eccentricity among the vertices of @xmath0 is called the radius of @xmath0 and is denoted by @xmath96 .",
    "the set of all vertices of minimum eccentricity is called the center of @xmath0 . a connected graph @xmath0",
    "is called self - centred if @xmath97 for each @xmath98 .",
    "the total eccentricity index of a connected graph @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath99 , is defined as the sum of eccentricities of vertices of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath100    one may consider the eccentricity of a vertex as a vertex weight of @xmath0 with the average @xmath101 . from this point of view , a graph is @xmath102-regular if and only if it is self - centred . in this point of view",
    ", it follows from that              a graph @xmath0 is called vertex - transitive if for every two vertices @xmath62 and @xmath63 of @xmath0 , there exists an automorphism @xmath107 of @xmath0 such that @xmath108 .",
    "it is known that any vertex - transitive graph is vertex degree regular , transmission regular and self - centred .",
    "hence it follows that      a nanostructure is an object of intermediate size between molecular and microscopic structures .",
    "it is a product derived through engineering at the molecular scale . in what follows we aim to apply corollary [ cor : vt ] to the molecular graph of a nanostructure called toroidal fullerenes ( or achiral polyhex nanotorus ) ( see fig . [",
    "fig : apn ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : apnlattice ] ) .",
    "* concluding remarks : * in this paper by considering some vertex weights , some topological indices appears in laplcian graph energy and average weight .",
    "note that several other vertex weight and thus their corresponding laplacian graph energy could be defined .",
    "for example if we define a weight of an arbitrary vertex @xmath62 as @xmath112 whose average one is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is referred to as forgotten zagreb index .",
