    "recently ellis and maartens [ 1 ] reconsidered the possibility of a cosmological model in which there is no big - bang singularity , no beginning of time and the universe effectively avoids a quantum regime for space - time by staying large at all times . the universe starts out in the infinite past as an almost static universe and expands slowly , eventually evolving into a hot big - bang era .",
    "an interesting example of this scenario is given by ellis , murugan and tsagas [ 2 ] , for a closed universe model with a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath0 , which has a special form of interaction potential @xmath1 .",
    "it was pointed out that this potential is similar to what one obtains from a @xmath2 theory after a suitable conformal transformation and identifying @xmath3 with a negative @xmath4 .",
    "although the probability of these solutions is not high , the emergent universe scenario nevertheless merits attention as it solves many conceptual and technical problems of the big bang model . in this paper , we point out that the starobinsky model , the original as well as the modified version , permit solutions describing an emergent universe . the solution may be used to model varieties of cosmological scenarios consistent with the observational results , available at present and expected in the near future .",
    "thus , it may be possible to build models which avoid the quantum regime for space - time but share the good features of the standard big bang model .    in the models considered in @xmath5 [ 1 ] @xmath6 [ 2 ] ,",
    "a closed universe was considered .",
    "however , recent results from boomerang and wmap indicate that the universe is most likely to be spatially flat .",
    "if the universe has always been large enough , the field equations become simpler .",
    "in fact , in the starobinsky model , the field equations can be written as a second order differential equation for the hubble parameter @xmath7 , vide equation ( 7 ) .",
    "in the starobinsky model , one considers the semi - classical einstein equation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor . in the case of",
    "free , massless , conformally invariant fields the vacuum expectation value @xmath9 can be written , with the robertson walker metric as , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are numbers and @xmath13 @xmath14 equation ( 2 ) , written for @xmath15 , gives the well - known trace - anomaly , indicating that the conformal invariance is broken by the regularization process .",
    "note that the two tensors @xmath16 and @xmath17 have different features .",
    "the tensor @xmath16 is identically conserved and can be obtained by varying a local action @xmath18 . however , one of the counter terms to be added to the lagrangian to regularise @xmath15 has the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a logarithmically divergent constant , thus permitting the possibility of an addition of any finite number to @xmath20 .",
    "hence , @xmath11 is not determined and can be given any arbitrary value including a negative one .",
    "the tensor @xmath17 is conserved only in a conformally flat universe and it can not be obtained by variation of any local action .",
    "the constant @xmath12 is fully determined , once the fields are specified , e.g. , @xmath21 where @xmath22 gives the number of quantum fields of spin i. the freedom of choosing @xmath11 arbitrarily has led to the modified starobinsky [ 3,4 ] model , where one adds a counter term @xmath23 , and chooses @xmath24 .",
    "the theory then becomes essentially a typical @xmath25 -theory .",
    "however , the earlier work on starobinsky models were done in the context of a big bang model .",
    "the emergent universe model needs a different scenario and one makes different choices of @xmath11 and @xmath26 , as will be shown below .",
    "let us choose @xmath27 and write the evolution equation ( 1 ) of the flat frw universe as @xmath28\\ ] ] which can be written in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath29    equation ( 7 ) will determine the evolution of the universe when the initial conditions are provided .",
    "we now look for a solution which describes a universe which exists eternally and always remains large so that a classical description is possible at all times .",
    "the matter , as indicated earlier , will be described by quantum field theories .",
    "we first note the following two exact solutions :    @xmath30 @xmath31 is a solution but it describes an eternally static universe .",
    "it can be checked that the solution is stable against small linear perturbations , if @xmath11 is positive . however , with @xmath11 negative , the state is unstable .",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33 gives a de sitter type solution , but the solution is not stable .    to get an emergent universe , we look for a solution of the suggestive form @xmath34 where the constants @xmath4 and @xmath35 will be determined from equation ( 7 ) . the constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 may be determined from initial conditions . since we have @xmath38 the function in ( 8) will be a solution , if @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "thus @xmath11 will be chosen negative in this model .",
    "the fact that the emergent universe scenario is indeed permitted by equation ( 7 ) comes as a surprise .",
    "since @xmath41 and @xmath12 are related , we have a one parameter family of solutions specified by the value of @xmath12 .",
    "the general features of the solutions are    \\1 ) the scale factor @xmath42 has a non - zero value @xmath43 as @xmath44 , which may be chosen much larger than the planck length .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath7 and its time derivatives @xmath45 and @xmath46 all vanish in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "thus the solution decribes an emergent universe with natural initial conditions .",
    "\\2 ) if @xmath48 , the universe remains almost static during the period @xmath49 .",
    "thus during the entire infinite past of @xmath50 , the universe expands only by a factor    @xmath51    for a large @xmath37 .",
    "[ fig.1 : ]    for @xmath52 , the universe expands rapidly , eventually reaching an asymptotically de sitter stage .",
    "fig 1 , gives the time variation of the hubble parameter and its derivatives , for @xmath53 ( which occurs if the particle number and species correspond to the minimal su(5 ) model ) and @xmath37 is given a value @xmath54 .",
    "\\3 ) it may be useful to check if the solution is stable under small linear perturbations .",
    "we write @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a small perturbation and @xmath57 is the solution obtained above . substituting this in equation ( 7 )",
    ", we obtain the equation for @xmath56 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "it is difficult to solve the equation ( 12 ) .",
    "however , if we assume that @xmath56 has a solution @xmath64 , we must have , for t negative , @xmath65 and @xmath66 can not be positive , since @xmath4 and @xmath37 are both positive .",
    "thus the solution seems to be stable under small perturbations at least in the negative t regime .",
    "\\4 ) the evolution can be described alternatively in terms of a scalar field by substituting @xmath67 in equation ( 7 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath68 where @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath72 has the shape of a double well potential with a maximum at @xmath73 and two minima for @xmath74 , giving @xmath75 .",
    "also note that @xmath73 gives an unstable static universe while the evolution of the emergent universe is given by the path from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "however , @xmath7 here is time dependent and is determined self - consistently by the instantaneous value of @xmath0 .",
    "the equation ( 15 ) does not make the problem simpler , although it looks very familiar and attractive .",
    "\\5 ) the prescribed evolution of the universe gets modified when particles are produced due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "we have considered above only massless , conformally coupled fields in conformally flat spacetimes , i.e. , the conformally trivial situation where no particles are produced .",
    "the perturbative calculations of particle production make use of small deviations from this conformal triviality .",
    "one considers either ( i ) a small mass and/or ( ii ) deviations from a conformally flat space time , say by assuming a bianchi i spacetime deviating a little from a frw spacetime or ( iii ) assuming a small non conformal coupling with @xmath78 . for simplicity",
    ", we shall consider here the case of non conformal coupling .",
    "let us consider a real massive scalar field satisfying the equation @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "as the scale factor changes , the changing gravitational field feeds energy into the prturbed scalar field modes .",
    "as long as the mode frequency of the field is greater than the hubble expansion rate , a co - moving detector will not respond .",
    "modes with lower frequencies will , however , be excited .",
    "thus the presence of mass makes the particle production process less efficient . to begin with we consider the case @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "zeldovich and starobinsky , starobinsky [ 3 ] , birrell and davies [ 3 ] and vilenkin [ 4 ] have studied this case .",
    "the rate of particle production per unit volume per unit conformal time @xmath83 , @xmath84 , is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the scalar curvature .",
    "this gives @xmath87\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "2 , we have plotted @xmath88 against @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we note that the rate of particle production peaks around @xmath92 , as expected .",
    "increase in the number of species of particles i.e. , a higher value of @xmath12 will indicate a delay in particle production and also a wider peak .",
    "the dependence of the rate of particle production on the parameter @xmath37 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the absolute value of the peaks depends on the value of the scale factor @xmath93 and the constant @xmath36 may be determined from the rate of particle production .",
    "although we have considered zero mass particle we expect similar results even when @xmath94 is nonzero but small ( see vilenkin [ 4 ] ) . during the subsequent evolution the particles produced thermalize and the universe enters eventually into a radiation dominated stage of the standard hot bigbang model .",
    "the details of the process of particle production and the evolution of the universe will be considered elsewhere .",
    "[ fig.2 : ]    [ fig.3 : ]",
    "we have presented here a one parameter family of solutions of the starobinsky model which describes an emergent universe .",
    "the earlier work on starobinsky model was done in the context of big bang singularity and the particle production was achieved by its oscillatory solution .",
    "the present solution on the other hand describes the universe which is almost dormant during the infinite past period @xmath95 , after which it undergoes a rapid expansion , see fig .",
    "the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 are related with initial conditions .",
    "they also introduce a new mass scale in the process of particle production .",
    "we have not considered here any specific theory of particle interactions which will determine the subsequent evolution of the universe as well as the details of large scale structure formation .",
    "whether the present scenario can successfully explain the present observational data needs further study .",
    "however , the fact that one encounters solutions describing an emergent universe in different contexts may be a good reason for taking such solutions seriously , although the probabilities for such solutions may not be very high .",
