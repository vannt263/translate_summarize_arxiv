    "compact dark masses , probably massive ( mbhs ) , have been detected in the cores of many nearby galaxies ( kormendy and richstone 1995 , kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) ) .",
    "magorrian ( 1998 ) presented a sample of 32 nearby galaxies with mbhs and suggested that the ( bh ) mass is proportional to the luminosity of the host galaxy or host bulge ( or equivalently , to their mass ) hereafter referred to as the bh / bulge relation , with the bh mass being about 0.006 of the mass of the spheroidal bulge ( although with a significant scatter ) .",
    "in addition to the mbhs detected by techniques of stellar and gas kinematics , the masses of about three dozen mbhs in agns have been estimated by reverberation mapping of the broad emission - line region .",
    "high quality reverberation data and virial bh mass estimates are presently available for 20 seyfert 1 nuclei ( wandel , peterson and malkan 1999 , hereafter wpm ) and 17 pg quasars ( kaspi 2000 ) .",
    "laor ( 1998 ) suggested that the masses of bhs in quasars ( estimated empirically ) and their host bulges follow the bh / bulge relation of magorrian ( 1998 ) . using the wpm seyfert sample with bulge estimates from whittle ( 1992 ) wandel ( 1999 ) found that the bh / bulge ratio is significantly lower ( on average , by a factor of @xmath520 ) than the ratio found by magorrian ( 1998 ) for mbhs in quiescent galaxies .",
    "recent research using higher quality hst data and a more careful treatment of the modeling uncertainties give lower values for masses in nearby galaxies ( merritt and ferrarese 2001a ) , with an average to bulge mass ratio of @xmath50.001 and a nearly linear bh - bulge relation @xmath6 ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) .",
    "the updated lower dynamical bh mass estimates for quiescent galaxies reduced the discrepancy between inactive galaxies and mapped seyferts , but consequently , the quasars in laor s ( 1998 ) sample appear to have larger bh - bulge ratios than inactive galaxies and of less luminous agns .",
    "to explain this laor ( 2001 ) suggested a nonlinear bh - bulge mass relation , @xmath7 .",
    "ferrarese and merritt ( 2000 ) and gebhardt ( 2000a ) have found that the mass of mbhs in quiescent galaxies is better correlated with the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulge than with the bulge luminosity .",
    "although to date there are only a few ( less than ten ) seyfert galaxies with reliable measurements of stellar velocity and with reverberation bh mass estimates ( ferrarese 2001 ) , they seem to be consistent with the bh - velocity dispersion relation of inactive galaxies .",
    "recently mclure & dunlop ( 2001 , hereafter md01 ) have studied the bh - bulge relation of 30 quasars , combined with the seyfert galaxies in the wpm sample for which they estimate bulge magnitudes from hst imaging and bulge - disk decomposition . assuming a flattened blr geometry and a biased distribution of inclinations md01 suggest that the actual bh mass of agns is 3 times larger than inferred from the reverberation virial method assuming isotropic geometry . while at present a factor of 2 - 3 in the bh reverberation mass can not be ruled out , systematically increasing the seyfert bh masses by a factor of 3 seems to violate the agreement between seyferts and quiescent galaxies in the bh - velocity dispersion relation ( fig . 2 of ferrarese 2001 ) .    in this work",
    "we reconcile the bh - bulge mass relation of agn with that of quiescent galaxies , analyzing the factors which led to the earlier apparent discrepancies between seyferts , quasars and inactive galaxies , and demonstrate that all three groups do follow the same bh - bulge mass relation without a spatial geometry or bias for agns . in section 2 we present the sample , including 23 seyfert galaxies , 32 quasars and 35 inactive galaxies with reliable @xmath8 and bulge data . in section 3",
    "we show that the bh- bulge mass relation of the combined seyfert+quasar sample is consistent with that of inactive galaxies , both in slope and in normalization , discuss the uncertainties and point out the factors that produced the apparent discrepancy in the @xmath9 relation between seyferts and inactive galaxies in previous works .",
    "we also find that narrow line seyfert 1s and narrow line quasars have significantly lower @xmath0 ratios than broad line agns and inactive galaxies , which is the result of a systematic trend ( section 4 ) - a strong correlation between the bh mass to bulge luminosity ( or mass ) ratio and the emission line width of the active nucleus . in section 5",
    "we analyse the implications of the bh mass - stellar velocity dispersion relation , while section 6 discusses possible reasons for the lower bh / bulge ratio of narrow line agns .",
    "we compile a sample of 55 agns with bh mass and bulge magnitude .",
    "the agn data are listed in tables 1 ( seyferts ) and 2 ( quasars ) .",
    "we use @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we convert magnitudes from other works to the v band , using the relations @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we express the bulge magnitude in units of @xmath14 using the standard relation @xmath15 . to find the bulge mass we use the relation @xmath16 ( magorrian 1998 ) .",
    "we use the sample of 17 seyferts in wandel , peterson and malkan ( 1999 ) , supplemented by 6 more seyferts with reliable bh mass or bulge magnitude data : mrk 279 ( santos lleo 2001 ) , ngc 3516 and ngc 4593 ( ho 1999 , gebhardt 2000b ) and mrk 841 , ngc 4253 and ngc 6814 ( bulge magnitudes from virani , bh mass from l - r relation ( eq . 2 below , cf .",
    "laor 2001 ) . for the seyfert galaxies in the wpm sample we use the bulge magnitude given by md01 ,",
    "estimated from hst imaging and two dimensional bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "this method is more accurate than the empirical formula for the bulge / total ratio depending on the hubble type ( simien & devaucouleurs 1986 ; whittle 1992 ) used in wandel ( 1999 ) .",
    "the bulge luminosity obtained by bulge / disk decomposition of galaxy images is systematically lower than the empirical estimate : for the 15 seyferts common to wandel ( 1999 ) and md01 the latter have an average bulge magnitude lower by a factor of 3 .",
    "however , the difference in the bulge magnitude estimated by the two methods is not uniform : for individual objects it varies between 1 and 10 .",
    "we find that the correction factor ( that is , the ratio of the bulge luminosity derived by md01 from hst imaging and that estimated from the simien & devaucouleurs ( sdv ) relation ) is correlated with the fwhm of the broad emission lines ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for example , while the seyferts with the broadest lines ( f9 , ic 4329a , ngc 3227 and ngc 4151 ) have correction factors of order 10 , the narrow line objects ( mrk 335 and the marginally narrow line 3c120 ) have a negligible correction , @xmath17 .",
    "the best fit to the bulge luminosity correction for the 15 seyferts in md01 is @xmath18 the correlation coefficient is r=0.77 with a @xmath19 probability of chance correlation .",
    "this empirical correlation is so tight that we use it to predict the actual bulge magnitude from the sdv relation for seyferts which do not have directly measured bulge luminosity . with the empirical formula",
    "we obtain bulge magnitudes for the five seyferts in our sample which do not have measured bulge luminosity ( akn 120 , mrk 110 , mrk 279 , ngc 3516 , ngc 4593 ) . in the above analyses we have used for 3c390.3 a fwhm h@xmath20=3500(crenshaw 1986 ) which is substantially lower than the value of @xmath21 reported in wpm ; this very broad feature may be temporary , due to the line profile variability ( peterson , private communication ) .",
    "we adopt the quasar sample of md01 , supplemented by pg1425 + 267 ( kirhakos 1999 ) and pg1704 + 60 ( bh mass from kaspi 2000 , host magnitude from hamilton , casetano and turnshek 2000 ) .",

    "we test the goodness of the empirical r - l relation for the quasars with data .",
    "there are four quasars in the md01 sample with data ( kaspi 2000 ) - pg0052 , pg0953 , 3c273 and pg1307 .",
    "comparing the bh masses the agreement between the empirical r - l relation and the result is within a factor of 1.5 .",
    "there are three quasars for which our bh mass ( calculated with the empirical formula ) differs significantly from the values given by md01 ( after correcting for their different kinematic factor , see 2.4 below ) : pg1307 ( the mass in md01 is by a factor 4 too low , apparently because a mistaken fwhm ) , similarly for 0204 + 292 ( 3c059 ) md01 get a bh mass too low by a factor 40 ( they have fwhm=1040 km / s , while we use a fwhm(h@xmath20 ) of 6800 km / s , cf .",
    "erackleous & halpern 1994 ) and pg 1012 + 008 ( their bh mass is by a factor 10 too low , probably a typo ) .      for comparison with inactive or weakly active galaxies",
    "we adopt the sample of kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) , which lists 37 galaxies with bh mass determinations from stellar or gas dynamics and bulge magnitudes .",
    "we use the relation b - v=0.8 in order to translate the b bulge magnitude to our standard v luminosity .",
    "we exclude the two galaxies ngc4486b and ngc5845 which have a large uncertainty ( factor 10 ) in the bh mass , significantly larger than the other objects in the sample . in the @xmath53 analyses",
    "we also exclude ngc 4945 which does not have a @xmath27 observation .",
    "the bh mass of agns can be estimated assuming the emission - line gas is bound ( see section 6.5 ) .",
    "the virial relation the gives @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the velocity dispersion in the gas ( deduced from the observed width @xmath56 of the emission lines ) and the kinematic factor @xmath57 , which depends on the kinematics , geometry and emissivity of the blr . assuming the velocity dispersion in the line emitting gas is isotropic we have @xmath58 , which gives @xmath59 non isotropic geometry and velocity dispersion ( combined with a non - uniform distribution of inclinations ) can give different values of the coefficient @xmath57 ( see section 6.4 ) .",
    "md01 assume a flattened blr geometry and a distribution of inclination biased to face - on , which yield @xmath60 and hence the virial bh mass is 3 times larger than in the isotropic geometry .",
    "in fig . 2 we plot the bh mass vs. bulge luminosity .",
    "notably the scatter in the seyfert and quasar groups is quite large .",
    "we note however that all agns with low @xmath61 values are narrow objects ( nls1s or narrow line quasars ) . in other words",
    ", it seems that narrow line agns tend to have small bhs compared to their host bulges .",
    "we draw the limit between narrow and broad line seyferts at 2200 , which is close to the traditional nls1 definition ( 2000 ) but includes a couple of narrow line objects in our sample which are very close to that definition ( mrk 590 , pg0157 + 00 and pg2247 + 14 ) .",
    "the precise value is not important , as the nls1 definition is merely a historic convention , and our results are not very sensitive to the exact border value .    in section 4",
    "we show that there is a strong correlation between line width and bh / bulge ratio , so that the transition from broad to narrow line objects is gradual , as well as the transition from high to low bh / bulge ratios .",
    "this correlation further supports the separation of the narrow - line objects : as the bh mass estimate of agns strongly depends on the line width , removing the narrow - line objects may seem to automatically remove the outlying data points with low bh / bulge ratio .",
    "however , we find that this is not the case , as the bh / bulge mass ratio depends also on other observables : the blr radius and the bulge magnitude . in order to test the significance of separating the narrow line objects , we compare the two correlations : bh mass vs. fwhm and bh / bulge ratio vs. fwhm . the correlation coefficients are 0.62 and 0.80 , respectively , which shows that the bh / bulge - fwhm relation is more significant than the mere bh mass dependence on the fwhm .    in section 6",
    "we discuss a few physical and observational models which could explain such a correlation and motivate the separation of the narrow line objects .",
    "we group those objects ( narrow line seyfert 1s and narrow line quasars ) as a separate class which we denote nlan ( narrow line active nuclei ) .",
    "the best fits to the data are ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 are in solar units )    1 .   quiescent galaxies ( 35 ) : + @xmath64 , 2 .   broad line agns ( 19 seyferts and 28 quasars ) + @xmath65 , 3 .   narrow line agns ( 4 seyferts and 4 quasars ) : @xmath66 4 .",
    "quiescent galaxies and broad line agns ( 82 ) + @xmath67 .",
    "the fits for the bh / bulge mass relation , along with the corresponding correlation measures are detailed in table 3 below .",
    "the ( broad line ) agns have an almost linear fit very similar to that of inactive galaxies and to the combined sample of broad - line agns and quiescent galaxies .",
    "the nlan group has a similar slope but with an @xmath68 ratio approximately a factor of 10 lower .",
    "transforming bulge luminosity to mass one finds a similar correlation between the bh mass and the bulge mass .",
    "the correlation is analogous to the bh mass vs. bulge luminosity relation ( fig .",
    "2 ) , with a somewhat less steep slope ( since @xmath69 . fig .",
    "3 shows the bh mass vs. the bulge mass . in we list the best fits to the @xmath8 vs. @xmath70 relation for broad line agns ( seyfert 1s and quasars ) , narrow line agns ( nls1s and nl qsos ) and quiescent galaxies , as well as for the combined sample . for each subset",
    "we give the three measures of the fit : the correlation coefficient , the standard deviation of the ( logarithmic ) scatter , given by @xmath71^{1/2}$ ] and the reduced @xmath72 of the fit . since the bh mass estimates have systematic modeling uncertainties ( section 4 ) , we approximate the uncertainty in the @xmath72 calculation by a uniform error of 0.5 dex ( factor 3 ) in the bh mass estimate , which is derived by combining the typical observational error with the systematic uncertainty ( see section 3.3 below ) .",
    "we also list the mean bh / bulge mass ratios and their standard deviations . in order to compare the bh - bulge correlation with that of the @xmath53 relation",
    "we have added a row showing the @xmath53 correlation for quiescent galaxies .",
    "since both correlations have the same y - variable ( @xmath8 ) they can be compared using the same statitstic .",
    "for consistency we treat the errors in the bh mass for agns and quiescent galaxies in the same manner , although in some cases , such as the galaxy and ngc 4258 , the error in the bh mass is much smaller .",
    "note that the effective error ( factor 3 ) assumed for the bh mass is larger than the measurement uncertainty for most bhs in quiescent galaxies .",
    "using merely the measurement uncertainty in @xmath8 , e.g. the error bars quoted in the kormendy and gebhardt ( 2001 ) sample gives @xmath733.5 for the @xmath53 relation and @xmath74 for @xmath8-bulge relation .",
    "we note several important results :    1 .",
    "broad - line ( bl ) agns have a very similar distribution ( for both , slope and mean mh / bulge ratio ) to that of the quiescent galaxies . 2 .   in spite of their small number in out sample , removing the narrow line agns has a significant effect on the combined agn sample : the total agn sample has a significantly lower correlation coefficient , and a lower mean bh / bulge ratio than bl agns and quiescent galaxies .",
    "nlans have an average a bh / bulge ratio lower by a factor of 10 than the broad line agn average , and the normalization of the best fit is similarly lower .",
    "quasars and seyfert galaxies as separate groups have shallower slopes and lower correlation coefficients , due to the lower dynamical range of each of these groups separately . 5 .",
    "the bh - bulge correlation of broad line agns is quite tight , not much less than the @xmath53 relation for quiescent galaxies .",

    "the measurement error would flatten the slope and increase the uncertainty in laor s fit , which would ecome consistent with linearity .",
    "( ii ) the bh masses used by laor ( 1998 ; 2001 ) are systematically larger than those used in this work ( and in md01 ) .",
    "the bh masses in laor s sample are are on average larger by a factor of 1.5 than those calculated for the same quasars in our sample .",
    "this discrepancy originates in part from the different luminosity measures used : laor used the broad band ( 0.1 - 1 micron ) luminosity ( neugebauer et .",
    "1979 ) while we ( and md01 ) use the monochromatic luminosity @xmath91 .",
    "the latter seems more adequate here , as we ( as well as md01 ) estimate the bh mass of the quasars using the empirical @xmath92 relation of kaspi ( 2000 ) which has been derived with @xmath91 .",
    "we conclude that quasars , seyfert galaxies and inactive galaxies have the same bh - bulge relation and bh / bulge ratio , while nlans seem to have bh / bulge ratios lower by factors of @xmath51 - 30 .",
    "previous works have found a significant difference in the mass- bulge luminosity ( or mass ) relationship of seyferts and ordinary galaxies , the former showing systematically lower @xmath61 values ( wandel 1999 , ho 1999 , gebhardt 2000b ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the @xmath0 ratio of quiescent galaxies and seyferts ( factor of 10 - 20 on average ) was a result of three factors , shown schematically by the arrows in fig . 2 : ( i ) the magorrian bh masses were overestimated by an average factor of @xmath93 ( @xmath940.6% compared with the current estimate of 0.1 - 0.13% ( ho 1999 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001a ) .",

    "( iii ) narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies , which do seem to have bh / bulge mass ratios lower than broad line active galaxies , lowered the average . excluding the nls1s raises the average @xmath0 value of agns by a factor of @xmath96 , denoted in fig . 2 by the arrow pointing upwards . items ( ii - iii ) combined increased the bh / bulge ratio of seyferts by an average factor of @xmath53.5 .",

    "similarly , the disagreement between the bh / bulge ratios of the pg quasars and seyferts ( wandel 1999 ) disappeared due to the revision of the seyferts bh / bulge ratio and the lower bh mass estimates of the quasars ( the arrow denoted by q in fig 2 ) .    given the present good agreement of agns and quiescent galaxies , one may ask whether there is room for systematically higher bh mass estimates in agns , e.g. due to inclination effects . in the geometry suggested by md01",
    ", the virial bh mass of agn would be larger on average factor of 3 , compared with the mass calculated under the assumption of isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "we can check what would be the implication of such an increase on the bh - bulge and bh - velocity dispersion relations of agns compared with those of quiescent galaxies ( where the bh mass estimates are not affected ) . in order to test this hypothesis",
    "we calculate the @xmath72 of the agn sample ( including the nlans ) with the bh mass increased by a uniform factor 3 , with respect to the best fit to the quiescent galaxies presented in table 3 . assuming the typical measurement + modeling error in the bh mass is 0.5 dex , this gives a reduced @xmath72 of 2.2 compared with 1.20 for bh masses calculated with an `` isotropic blr '' assumption for all agns in our sample .",
    "a similar exercise can be done for the @xmath97 relation , which has less agns , but also lower spread and a smaller error in the bh mass . increasing each bh mass by a factor of 3 , we find for the 11 seyfert galaxies with velocity dispersion data ( table 1 ) @xmath72 of 2.58 compared with 1.08 for the `` isotropic blr '' bh masses .",
    "we conclude that the bh mass calculated under the `` isotropic blr '' assumption for the blr geometry is more consistent with the bh - bulge and bh - velocity dispersion relations for quiescent galaxies .",
    "we find that narrow - line agns - nls1s and narrow line quasars - tend to have low @xmath0 values .",
    "this gives a physical motivation to the exclusion of the narrow line agns as a separate group in the bh - bulge relation .",
    "mathur ( 2001 ) make a similar suggestion based on a sample of 15 nls1s , but with less reliable bh masses .",
    "only three of the objects in their sample have masses measured by , 3 more by the scaling - virial method , and the 9 remaining bh masses are calculated using accretion disk modeling , which is less reliable .",
    "they find that their accretion disk model gives bh masses too large ( by a factor of 3 - 7 ) compared with the masses ( where available ) . in order to compensate for this discrepancy",
    "they decrease the bh masses given by the accretion - disk model by a calibration correction factor of 5 . for the bulge magnitude mathur use whittle ( 1992 ) with the simien - devaucouleurs relation ( which is likely to overestimate the bulge magnitude in agn , as discussed in above ) .    considering all @xmath98 agns in our sample with available @xmath8 and bulge magnitude",
    "we find that the smaller bh / bulge ratio of narrow line objects is in fact the lower end of a more general relation : the bh mass /bulge luminosity ratio is strongly correlated with the width .        in fig .",
    "4 we plot @xmath61 vs. fwhm(h@xmath20 ) .",
    "the best linear least - squares fit is    @xmath99 with a correlation coefficient @xmath100 .",
    "bh mass and bulge luminosity are in solar units , and we have excluded pg1704 because of its highly uncertain reverberation bh mass determination ( however , if we take the bh mass and fwhm values quoted in kaspi ( 2000 ) it agrees well with the fit in fig .",
    "the tight correlation ( 5 ) is not surprising - it is actually an artifact of the virial relation : since @xmath101 , this correlation merely means that @xmath102 is independent on the line width . combining eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) we have @xmath103 looking at the data we find almost precisely the same result - a very tight correlation between bulge luminosity and blr size ( in preparation ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the best fit to all 55 agns in our sample combined is @xmath104 or @xmath105 with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 .",
    "we note that while seyferts and nls1s show a significant correlation , quasars alone do not .",
    "this is not surprising , as the blr size of most quasars in our sample is determined from the r - l scaling relation , which is less reliable than mapping , used for most of the seyferts .",
    "however , the quasars , which do have measured blr sizes ( solid circles in fig . 5 ) are indeed very close to the fit .",
    "this is a non - trivial correlation , not just a derivation , as it relates two independent observables : on the one hand the bulge luminosity , a global galactic property on a kpc - scale , and on the other hand the blr size ( measured by mapping or luminosity scaling ) , on a few light - days scale .",
    "it may be reflecting the bh - bulge relation , but the correlation being much stronger than the bh - bulge relation supports the case that this new relation is more fundamental .",
    "a possible connection to basic physical properties may be implied by combining the new blr - bulge relation , the empirical relation between the blr size and the central source luminosity ( e.g. kaspi 2000 ) and the bh - bulge relation giving that the eddington ratio increases with bh mass .",
    "we have shown that the /bulge ratio in nls1 galaxies seems to be significantly smaller than in broad line agns and in quiescent galaxies .",
    "however , seyfert galaxies seem to be consistent with the @xmath106 relation of inactive galaxies ( gebhardt 2000b ; merritt & ferrarese 2001b ; ferrarese 2001 ) . in order to unveil the origin of the lower bh / bulge ratio of nlans ( namely ,",
    "whether they really have lower bh masses or rather larger bulges , relative to the broad line agn ) we look at their location in the @xmath106 plane .",
    "the bulge velocity dispersion is measured only for 3 nls1s ( mrk 110 , mrk 590 and ngc 4051 ) and 8 broad - line seyferts ( table 1 ) .",
    "we may use the faber - jackson relation to estimate the velocity dispersion of other agns with measured or estimated bulge luminosity .",
    "also the relation between the the narrow emission lines and the velocity dispersion ( nelson 2000 ) may be used to estimate the velocity dispersion in the bulge .",
    "here we use the standard f - j relation , e.g. @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is a luminosity coefficient determined by a linear fit with a slope of 4 to the observed seyfert galaxies ( fig .",
    "in our limited data set we note that nls1s have a significantly larger luminosity coefficient than broad line ones : while for broad line seyfert 1 galaxies @xmath110 , for nls1s galaxies @xmath111 .",
    "in addition , galaxies with a massive bhs and agns in particular , may have a different ( flatter ) f - j relation than galaxies in general ( wandel 2001 and work in preparation ) .    using these relations",
    "one may compile a larger sample and increase the dynamical range by including also quasars , to estimate the @xmath106 relation for agns . in fig .",
    "7 the bh mass is plotted against the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "we see that agns are consistent with the @xmath53 relation of inactive galaxies ( @xmath112 , with @xmath113 ; gebhardt ( 2000a ) find @xmath1143.65 and merritt and ferrarese ( 2001a ) give 4.72 ) . adding the quasars seem to favor a steeper slope , but this result merely reflects the assumed @xmath115 relation ;",
    "if , for example , a flatter @xmath116 relation is assumed , the luminous objects would have a larger estimated velocity dispersion yielding a flatter slope for the @xmath117 relation . in fig .",
    "7 we indicate by an arrow how the velocity dispersion estimate of luminous objects would move if the best fit to the f - j relation ( @xmath118 ) for the seyferts ( dotted line in fig 6 ) were used .        in agreement with previous results ( gebhardt 2000b ,",
    "merritt & ferrarese 2001b ) the nlans ( solid and open pink squares in fig 7 ) are more or less consistent with the @xmath53 relation , although they do lie at the lower end of the distribution .",
    "the agreement of the @xmath53 relations of inactive galaxies and agns ( broad and narrow line ) suggests that the virial masses are essentially correct also for nlans .",
    "the tendency of the nlans to have low @xmath119 ratios suggests that their lower bh - bulge ratios go along with relatively lower bh masses than broad line agns . in order to settle this issue ,",
    "more stellar velocity - dispersion measurements of agns are required , in particular of nls1s .",
    "the difference between nlans and broad line agns in the bh - bulge relation is much larger than the difference in the bh - velocity - dispersion relation .",
    "this may be related to the bulge mass ( and luminosity ) being integral , extended properties , while the stellar velocity dispersion is more closely related to the inner part of the bulge .",
    "there is more evidence that the mass in agn is correlated with the velocity dispersion ( and hence the virial mass ) on the scale of the central part of the bulge - the narrow line region .",
    "this is supported by the correlation between the mass and the velocity dispersion of the narrow emission - line gas , as measured by the [ oiii ] lines in seyfert 1 nuclei ( wandel and mushotzky 1986 ; nelson 2000 ) .",
    "we have seen that broad line agns follow a similar bh - bulge relation as inactive galaxies .",
    "the question remains what can be the cause of the lower bh / bulge ratio in the narrow - line agns , and whether this effect is real or apparent .",
    "several effects have been mentioned that could cause such an apparent lower bh / bulge ratio ( e.g. wandel 2000 ) : ( i ) the - virial method may systematically underestimate the bh mass in nlans , ( ii ) the measured bulge luminosity in nlans may be systematically too large .",
    "alternatively , the difference between the two groups could be real : either ( iii ) nlans do have intrinsically larger ( or brighter ) bulges , or ( iv ) they have systematically smaller . in section 5",
    "we have seen that effects ( ii ) and ( iii ) are supported by the @xmath117 relation , as the narrow - line seyferts with measured velocity dispersion ( mrk 110 , mrk 590 and ngc 4051 ) seem to have larger bulge luminosity than broad line seyferts with comparable velocity dispersions ( fig . 6 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "also ( i ) and ( iv ) can not be ruled out , as the virial bh masses of mrk 590 and ngc 4051 are by a factor 2 - 3 lower than the average @xmath53 relation of broad line seyferts and inactive galaxies ( fig.7 ) .",
    "there are a number of observational errors that may cause an apparent difference in the - bulge luminosity relation between nlans and classic agns and inactive galaxies , which we discuss below .      as suggested above , the lower @xmath120 values of nlan",
    "could be accounted for if their bulge luminosity are systematically over estimated .",
    "as we saw , this was indeed the case when the simien - devaucouleurs method was used for seyfert galaxies .",
    "could a similar problem exist in the nlan set ?",
    "two of the 3 nls1s with measured velocity dispersion have low @xmath119 values which may indicate they have relatively small .",
    "however , the location of the nlans in the @xmath53 plot ( fig 7 ) with respect to the inactive and broad line agns indicates that the bh mass can account for only a small part of the difference , suggesting that nls1s tend to have relatively large bulges .",
    "it is however difficult to see why the bulge magnitude of nlans be _ systematically _ over - estimated by a factor of @xmath510 ( required to explain the difference in the bh / bulge ratio ) compared with the broad line agns in the sample .",
    "is it possible that nlans represent a larger population of galaxies with low mass to bulge luminosity ratios , which is under - represented in the presently available mbh sample",
    "? this could be the case for mbhs detected using stellar dynamics , because this method can not detect small , and the detection - limit increases with distance . in a resolution - limited method",
    ", this would infer a lower detection limit which increases with luminosity .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the distribution of dynamically estimated masses in quiescent galaxies .",
    "there are only four inactive galaxies with bh masses under  @xmath121 : the milky way , m32 and ngc 7457 detected using stellar dynamics and ngc4945 - with maser dynamics .",
    "the two latter galaxies also have low -to bulge luminosity ratios , comparable to the nlan average ratio . in angular - resolution limited methods , the mbh detection limit is correlated with bulge luminosity : for more luminous bulges the detection limit is higher , because the stellar velocity dispersion is higher ( the faber - jackson relation ) . in order to detect the dynamic effect of a mbh it is necessary to observe closer to the center , while the most luminous galaxies tend to be at larger distances , so for a given angular resolution the mbh detection limit is higher .",
    "this may imply that the sample is biased towards larger mbhs , as present stellar - dynamical methods are ineffective for detecting mbhs below @xmath122 ( except in the nearest galaxies ) .",
    "since the blr method is not subject to this constraint , nlans may represent a low - mass bh population .",
    "in section 5 we have seen that the nlans are not significantly outlying the @xmath117 relation , while they are located far below the bh - bulge relation . in principle",
    "this could be caused by the bh influence on the measured velocity dispersion . in nlans",
    "the region influenced by the bh would be relatively smaller ( either because the bh has a lower mass or because the bulge is larger , and hence has a larger velocity dispersion ) .",
    "this can reduce the difference between narrow and broad line agns when @xmath27 rather than @xmath123 is considered .",
    "however , as we show below , the bh influence turns out to be negligible for almost all agns in our sample .",
    "the effect of the massive bh on the stellar velocity dispersion can be estimated by comparing the expected velocity field @xmath124 ) due to the mbh and the velocity dispersion of the host bulge .",
    "the enhances the velocity dispersion in an observed region if its mass is bigger or comparable to the stellar mass within the radius corresponding to the projected angular size .",
    "this can be measured by the dimensionless quantity @xmath125 where @xmath27 is the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulge of the host galaxy , @xmath126 is the angular size ( e.g. the width of the slit ) and @xmath127 is the distance to the galaxy . in other words",
    ", @xmath128 is roughly the ratio of the bh mass to the stellar bulge mass inside the radius corresponding to the angular size being sampled .",
    "the nuclear velocity dispersion is typically sampled with a slit width of 1 - 2(ferrarese 2001 use a slit of 2x4 ) .",
    "since the measured velocity dispersion is weighted by the brightness along the line - of - sight , and since the brightness - density increases steeply at the center , the effective value of @xmath126 is probably smaller than the slit width .",
    "the bh influence parameter can be written as @xmath129 , where @xmath126 has been assumed to be @xmath130 .",
    "we have calculated @xmath128 for the 11 seyferts with velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "the three nls1s have @xmath131 , lower than the bl seyferts which have typically @xmath132 , with the exception of ngc 3227 which has @xmath133 .",
    "we conclude that the bh influence on the velocity dispersion in the observed agns is negligible .",
    "if the broad emission - line region ( blr ) has a flattened geometry and the distribution of inclination angles is biased towards face - on inclinations ( as one might expect in the unified model ) the velocity inferred from the observed line width may be smaller than the 3d velocity dispersion , depending on the inclination and the amount of flattening .",
    "for example , for a flat blr configuration viewed at an inclination angle @xmath134 ( where @xmath135 corresponds to face - on ) , the line - of - sight velocity is smaller than the 3-d velocity by a factor of sin(@xmath134 ) . the inferred mass would thus be smaller than the actual mass by a factor of @xmath136 . for a random distribution of inclination angles ,",
    "the average inferred mass would be decreased by this factor weighted by the distribution , @xmath137 .",
    "actually , the distribution is probably not random . in the unified scheme seyfert",
    "1 nuclei are viewed more face - on , within an opening angle of @xmath138 degrees , so that the weighted average mass - reduction factor is @xmath139 .",
    "if the blr distribution is not flat but with an angular distribution of orbits spanning an angle @xmath140 , the effect would be less - between sin(@xmath134 ) and sin@xmath141 , depending on the distribution of orbits , so that roughly @xmath142 .",
    "this scenario can explain the lower @xmath61 values of nlans .",
    "the distribution of inclination angles can also explain the larger scatter of nlans , compared with broad line seyferts . in this scenario",
    ", nlans are agns with a flattened blr geometry .",
    "seen nearly face - on .",
    "is it possible that the masses of nlans are systematically underestimated by the - virial method ?",
    "the masses of all agn seem to be more or less correct , in light of the good agreement between agns and quiescent galaxies in the case of the - velocity dispersion relation .",
    "the uncertainty in the virial method is not well known . while for individual objects a factor of 2 - 3 may be representative , the sample average error is probably much smaller .",
    "this comes on top of the measurement uncertainty ; the uncertainty in the blr size ( calculated from the cross correlation of the continuum and line light curves ) can be quite large for objects with poor sampling or low variability . note that if the virial assumption is incorrect and the gas in the line emitting gas in nlans is unbound , the gas velocity is actually larger than keplerian , the mass would have been _ overestimated _ , which would increase the bh - bulge discrepancy between nlans and broad line seyfert galaxies ( and inactive galaxies ) .",
    "similarly , if the bh mass of broad line agns were underestimated , their present good agreement with the bh - bulge relation of quiescent galaxies would deteriorate , as demonstrated in section 3.4 .",
    "more generally , we may ask how reliable are the bh masses derived by the virial method ? could there be a systematic effect ?",
    "the best resolution of hst in relatively nearby galaxies translates into a distance of a few tens of parsecs from the mbh .",
    "reverberation mapping of the broad emission line region in agns gives a much closer view - a few light days from the center .",
    "assuming the line - emitting matter is gravitationally bound , having a keplerian velocity dispersion , it is possible to estimate the virial mass : @xmath143 this expression may be approximately valid also in the case the line emitting gas is not bound , such as radiation - driven motions and disk - wind models ( e.g. murray 1998 ) . the main problem in estimating the virial mass from the data is to obtain a reliable estimate of the size of the blr , and to correctly identify the line width with the velocity dispersion in the gas ( wpm , krolik 2001 ) .",
    "wpm used the continuum / emission - line cross - correlation function to measure the responsivity - weighted radius @xmath144 of the blr ( koratkar & gaskell 1991 ) , and the variable ( rms ) component of the spectrum to measure the velocity dispersion in the same part of the gas , which is used to calculate the blr size , automatically excluding constant features such as narrow emission lines and galactic absorption .",
    "kaspi ( 2000 ) find that for most objects in their sample , similar mass estimates are obtained also using either the rms as or the mean fwhm .",
    "the case for a central mbh dominating the kinematics in the broad emission - line region is supported by the keplerian velocity profile ( @xmath145 ) detected in ngc 5548 ( peterson & wandel 1999 ) and ncg 7469 and 3c390.3 ( peterson & wandel 2000 ) .",
    "although different have quite different line widths , the delays also vary from line to line in such a way that the virial masses derived from different emission lines are all consistent with a single value .",
    "this demonstrates the case for a keplerian velocity dispersion in the line - width / time - delay data .",
    "another support for the validity of the virial mass estimates comes from the consistency of the -bulge relations for agn and inactive galaxies : the @xmath53 relation ( ferrarese 2001 ) , and the @xmath120 relation ( this work ) .",
    "the different bh - bulge relation of nlans compared with broad - line agns and inactive galaxies could suggest that nlans may be intrinsically different .",
    "one possibility is that they are in a different evolutionary stage .",
    "wandel ( 1999 ) suggested that in agns which are radiating near the eddington luminosity , the central accretes within a relatively short time scale most of the readily available matter .",
    "bhs accreting near the limit are still growing , hence their mass ( relative to the bulge ) may be smaller than in agns with lower @xmath146 ratios such as seyferts 1s which may be past the most active phase .",
    "similarly , mbhs in normal galaxies may be the remnants of a past luminous agn phase , and their bhs did not grow significantly after the decline in the accretion rate .",
    "this could explain the discrepancy between narrow and broad line agns ( nlans tend to be near the limit ) , as well as the similar bh - bulge relations of broad line agns and inactive galaxies .",
    "this scenario has been followed with a simple model calculation by wang , biermann and wandel ( 2000 ) who examined the relative contribution of mergers to the bulge and bh mass . for reasonable parameters",
    "they find that a bh / bulge mass ratio of @xmath147 is obtained by evolution of the mbh due to eddington - limited accretion enhanced due to mergers .",
    "we re - examine the purported discrepancy between the - bulge luminosity relation of mbhs in nearby galaxies ( measured with stellar- and gas dynamics methods ) and -mapped seyfert nuclei ( wandel 1999 ) . using updated data .",
    "we find that the bh / bulge relation of agns and inactive galaxies are in good agreement over 3 orders of magnitude in bulge luminosity or bh mass .",
    "we show that the apparent difference reported previously originated from overestimated bh masses in quiescent galaxies , overestimated bulge luminosity for the seyferts and including narrow - line seyfert 1s which seem to have genuinely low bh / bulge ratios .",
    "we find that the lower bh / bulge ratio of narrow line agns is part of a more general inverse correlation of the bh / bulge ratio with the emission - line width .",
    "considering the bh - velocity dispersion correlation , the lower bh / bulge ratio of narrow - line agns seems to be related ( at least in part ) to the host , as narrow and broad line agns ( as well as inactive galaxies ) seem to have a similar @xmath106 relation .",
    "we predict the velocity dispersion of high luminosity agn using the faber jackson relation derived from seyfert galaxies for with a measured @xmath27 .",
    "we discuss three classes of explanations for the lower bh / bulge ratios of narrow - line agns : mass - bulge luminosity relation of seyfert galaxies and mbhs in normal galaxies : observational or method - related errors or bias , intrinsic and orientation - related effects and evolution .",

    "<S> we show that agns ( seyfert galaxies and quasars ) follow the same bh - bulge relation as ordinary ( inactive ) galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the bh / bulge relation for a sample of 55 agns and 35 quiescent galaxies , finding that broad line agns have an average black hole / bulge mass fraction of @xmath1 with a strong correlation ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this bh - bulge relation is consistent with the bh - bulge relation of quiescent galaxies and much tighter than previous results . </S>",
    "<S> narrow line agns appear to have a lower ratio , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find this to be a more general feature , the bh / bulge ratio in agns being inversely correlated with the emission - line width , implying a strong linear relation between the size of the broad emission line region and the luminosity of the bulge . finally , combining agns with observed and estimated stellar velocity dispersion , we find a significant correlation ( @xmath4 , consistent with that of quiescent galaxies . </S>"
