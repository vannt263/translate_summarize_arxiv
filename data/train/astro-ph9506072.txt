    "the theory of galaxy formation based on gravitational instability is aimed at describing how primordially - generated fluctuations in matter and radiation grow into galaxies and clusters of galaxies due to self - gravity .",
    "a perturbation theory can be formulated when the amplitudes of the fluctuations are small , and the growth of the fluctuations can be solved from the linear theory .    in the early universe , gravitational perturbations are inflated to wavelengths beyond the horizon at the end of the inflationary epoch .",
    "fluctuations of a given length scale reenter the horizon at a later time when the horizon has grown to the size of the fluctuations . although the process of galaxy formation in recent epochs is well described by newtonian gravity ( and other physical processes such as hydrodynamics ) , a general relativistic treatment is required for perturbations on scales larger than the horizon size before the horizon crossing time .",
    "the use of general relativity brought in the issue of gauge freedom which has caused some confusion over the years .",
    "lifshitz ( 1946 ) adopted the `` synchronous gauge '' for his coordinate system , which has since become the most commonly used gauge for cosmological perturbation theories .",
    "however , some complications associated with this gauge such as the appearance of coordinate singularities and spurious gauge modes prompted bardeen ( 1980 ) and others ( e.g. kodama & sasaki , 1984 ) to formulate alternative approaches that deal only with gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "a thorough review of the gauge - invariant perturbation theory and its application to texture - seeded structure formation models is given by durrer ( 1993 ) .",
    "another possibility is to adopt a different gauge .",
    "we will discuss in detail in this paper the conformal newtonian ( or the longitudinal ) gauge ( mukhanov , feldman & brandenberger 1992 ) , which is a particularly convenient gauge to use for scalar perturbations .",
    "it also has the feature that the two scalar fields that describe the metric perturbations in this gauge are identical ( up to a minus sign ) to the gauge - invariant variables bardeen ( 1980 ) constructed .",
    "the linear theory for a perturbed friedmann - robertson - walker universe was first developed by lifshitz ( 1946 ) , later reviewed in lifshitz & khalatnikov ( 1963 ) .",
    "the subsequent work can be found summarized in the textbooks by weinberg ( 1972 ) and peebles ( 1980 ) , in the reviews by kodama & sasaki ( 1984 ) and mukhanov et al ( 1992 ) , and in the summer school lectures by efstathiou ( 1990 ) , bertschinger ( 1995 ) , and bond ( 1995 ) .",
    "the theory has been applied to various cosmological models . in the synchronous gauge ,",
    "for example , peebles & yu ( 1970 ) solved the linear evolution equations for photons and baryons in the absence of massless neutrinos and non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "bond and szalay ( 1983 ) included the neutrinos but approximated them as a perfect fluid by using only the first two moments in the angular expansion of the neutrino distribution function .",
    "they also did not include cdm .",
    "xiang & kiang ( 1992 ) considered both cdm and massive neutrinos , but treated the latter as non - relativistic particles and also ignored massless neutrinos .",
    "holtzman ( 1989 ) provided fitting formulas for the baryonic transfer functions in various cosmological models , but gave no detailed description of the calculation , and again included only the first two moments of the neutrino distribution function .",
    "durrer ( 1989 ) obtained numerical solutions for the perturbations in the gauge - invariant formalism in the absence of baryons . instead of using the convenient multipole expansion technique , stompor ( 1994 ) adopted the earliest method by solving the massive neutrino distribution function directly at discrete momenta and angles .",
    "another important application of the linear theory is to the cosmic microwave background anisotropies .",
    "the early calculations of the radiation perturbations included only the baryons and the photons ( peebles & yu 1970 ; wilson & silk 1981 ) .",
    "the calculations were subsequently extended to dark matter dominated models ( e.g. bond & efstathiou 1984 , 1987 ; vittorio & silk 1984 , 1992 ; holtzman 1989 ) .",
    "the post - cobe era has seen a rapid increase in the number of papers on this subject ( see sugiyama & gouda 1992 ; white , scott , & silk 1994 ; and references therein ) .",
    "however , there has not been a complete treatment of the massive neutrinos to the accuracy that is needed for comparison with the near - future anisotropy experiments . truncating the _ massless _ neutrino moments beyond @xmath1 in the pure cdm model",
    "leads to a 10% error in the anisotropy power spectrum ( hu et al 1995 ) .",
    "one would expect a comparable or larger error if the @xmath1 modes were not included for the massless _ and _ massive neutrinos in cdm+hdm models .",
    "this paper differs from earlier ones in the literature in that we give a complete discussion of all particle species that are relevant to any flat cdm , hdm , or cdm+hdm models ( including a possible cosmological constant ) .",
    "these include cdm , baryons , photons , massless neutrinos , and massive neutrinos ( an hdm candidate ) .",
    "the recent interests in cdm+hdm models ( e.g. davis , summers , & schlegel 1992 ; klypin et al 1993 ; jing et al 1994 ; cen & ostriker 1994 ; ma & bertschinger 1994b ; ma 1994 ; primack et al 1995 ; klypin et al 1995 ) prompted us to provide a detailed treatment of the massive neutrino component , which was either ignored or crudely approximated in other works .",
    "part of the cause for neglecting this component was perhaps a lack of motivation when the standard cdm model was thought to match the observed structure well .",
    "another was perhaps due the sharp increase in the computing time required to deal with the time - dependent nature of the massive neutrinos energy - momentum relation . for completeness",
    ", we also give full details and results of the calculation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy including photon polarization and helium recombination .",
    "this paper serves two purposes .",
    "first , it is an independent paper in which we present a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar isentropic gravitational perturbations in the synchronous and conformal newtonian gauges . the coupled , linearized einstein , boltzmann , and fluid equations for the metric and density perturbations are presented in parallel in the two gauges .",
    "the cdm and the baryon components behave like collisionless and collisional fluids , respectively , while the photons and the neutrinos require a phase - space description governed by the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "we also derive analytically the time dependence of the perturbations on scales larger than the horizon to illustrate the dependence on the gauge choice .",
    "this information is needed in the initial conditions for the numerical integration of the evolution equations .",
    "this paper also serves as a companion paper to ma & bertschinger ( 1994a ) in which we reported the main results from our linear calculation of the full neutrino phase space in a cdm+hdm model with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "( the corresponding neutrino mass is @xmath7 ev . )",
    "the motivation was to obtain an accurate sampling of the neutrino phase space for the hdm initial conditions in subsequent @xmath8-body simulations ( ma & bertschinger 1994b ; ma 1994 ) of structure formation in cdm+hdm models .",
    "we adopted a two - step monte carlo procedure to achieve this goal : ( 1 ) integrate the coupled , linearized boltzmann , einstein , and fluid equations for all particle species in the model ( i.e. , cdm , hdm , photons , baryons and massless neutrinos ) to obtain the evolution of the metric perturbations ; ( 2 ) follow the trajectories of individual neutrinos by integrating the geodesic equations using the metric computed in ( 1 ) . since no coordinate singularities occur in the conformal newtonian gauge and the geodesic equations have simple forms , the geodesic integration in step ( 2 ) was carried out in this gauge , starting shortly after neutrino decoupling at redshift @xmath9 until @xmath10 .",
    "we focus on step ( 1 ) in this paper . following historical precedents",
    ", we first developed the code for the boltzmann integration in the synchronous gauge .",
    "the transformation relating the synchronous gauge and the conformal newtonian gauge was then derived and used to compute the metric perturbations in the latter gauge for step ( 2 ) of the calculation .",
    "subsequently we developed a code to perform the full integration in the conformal newtonian gauge .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we write down the metric for the two gauges and summarize their properties . in  3 , we derive the gauge transformation relating two arbitrary gauges and obtain the transformation between the synchronous and the conformal newtonian gauges .",

    " 4 and 5 .",
    "section 4 discusses the einstein equations with emphasis on the source terms , the energy - momentum tensor , in the two gauges .",
    "the perturbed fluid equations are derived from the energy - momentum conservation , which are applied to cdm and the baryons in  5 .",
    "the rest of  5 contains detailed treatments of the photon and neutrino phase space distributions , recombination , and the coupling of photons and baryons .",
    "the photon and neutrino distribution functions are expanded in legendre polynomials , reducing the linearized boltzmann equation to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations for the expansion modes .",
    "the massive neutrinos require a slightly more complicated treatment because the energy - momentum relation depends nontrivially on time when the neutrinos make a transition from being relativistic to non - relativistic .",
    "our method for computing the microwave background anisotropy is presented in  6 .",

    "the divergences of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( which are vectors ) are longitudinal and transverse , respectively , and @xmath34 is transverse , satisfying @xmath38 it then follows that @xmath36 can be written in terms of some scalar field @xmath39 and @xmath37 in terms of some divergenceless vector @xmath40 as @xmath41 the two scalar fields @xmath42 and @xmath39 ( or @xmath36 ) characterize the scalar mode of the metric perturbations , while @xmath43 ( or @xmath37 ) and @xmath34 represent the vector and the tensor modes , respectively .",

    ", there are serious disadvantages associated with the synchronous gauge . since the choice of the initial hypersurface and its coordinate assignments are arbitrary , the synchronous gauge conditions do not fix the gauge degrees of freedom completely .",
    "such residual gauge freedom is manifested in the spurious gauge modes contained in the solutions to the equations for the density perturbations .",
    "the appearance of these modes has caused some confusion over the years and prompted bardeen ( 1980 ) to formulate alternative approaches that deal only with gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "another difficulty with the synchronous gauge is that since the coordinates are defined by freely falling observers , coordinate singularities arise when two observers trajectories intersect each other : a point in spacetime will have two coordinate labels .",
    "a different initial hypersurface of constant time has to be chosen to remove these singularities .",
    "the conformal newtonian gauge ( also known as the longitudinal gauge ) advocated by mukhanov et al .",
    "( 1992 ) is a particularly simple gauge to use for the scalar mode of metric perturbations .",
    "the perturbations are characterized by two scalar potentials @xmath48 and @xmath49 which appear in the line element as @xmath50 it should be emphasized that the conformal newtonian gauge is a restricted gauge since the metric is applicable only for the scalar mode of the metric perturbations ; the vector and the tensor degrees of freedom are eliminated from the beginning .",
    "nonetheless , it can be easily generalized to include the vector and the tensor modes ( bertschinger 1995 ) .",
    "the discussion here will be confined to the scalar perturbations only .",
    "one advantage of working in this gauge is that the metric tensor @xmath51 is diagonal .",
    "this simplifies the calculations and leads to simple geodesic equations ( ma & bertschinger 1994a ) .",
    "another advantage is that @xmath48 plays the role of the gravitational potential in the newtonian limit and thus has a simple physical interpretation .",
    "moreover , the two scalar potentials @xmath48 and @xmath49 in this gauge are related to the gauge - invariant variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 of bardeen ( 1980 ) and @xmath54 and @xmath55 of kodama & sasaki ( 1984 ) by the simple relation @xmath56 no gauge modes are present in this gauge to obscure the meaning of the physical modes since the gauge freedom is completely fixed for @xmath11 aside from the addition of spatial constants to @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "bardeen ( 1980 ) was concerned that a large shear stress would lead to large metric perturbations in the conformal newtonian gauge .",
    "we see that this does not happen for isentropic growing - mode perturbations in which the shear stress arises solely due to the free - streaming of relativistic collisionless particles .",
    "we see that @xmath153 grows with time in the synchronous gauge but remains a constant in the conformal newtonian gauge before horizon crossing .",
    "another significant difference is the larger value of the velocity perturbations for small @xmath454 in the conformal newtonian gauge .",
    "physically , this difference arises because velocity perturbations vanish to lowest order in the synchronous gauge because the synchronous gauge spatial coordinates are lagrangian coordinates for freely - falling observers (  2 ) .",
    "the next - order velocity perturbations differ for the neutrinos and photons because these two fluids have effectively different equations of state : the neutrinos are collisionless while the photons behave like a perfect fluid due to their strong coupling to the baryons . in the conformal newtonian gauge , the lowest - order velocity perturbations do not vanish because the conformal newtonian gauge spatial coordinates are eulerian coordinates .",
    "if we were to include the next - order corrections to @xmath116 proportional to @xmath495 , differences between the different fluid components would appear in equations ( [ super2 ] ) .    in the conformal newtonian gauge , the mode proportional to @xmath477 in the synchronous gauge yields @xmath496 .",

    "\\(2 ) the perturbations come into causal contact after horizon crossing and become nearly independent of the coordinate choices . as figure  [ fig : del ] shows ,",
    "@xmath233 , @xmath549 , and @xmath550 in the two gauges are almost identical at late times . for cdm ,",
    "the @xmath44-modes that enter the horizon during the radiation - dominated era behave very differently from those entering in the matter - dominated era .",
    "the critical scale separating the two is the horizon distance at the epoch of radiation - matter equality ( @xmath551 ) : @xmath552 mpc@xmath6 for our parameters . for the modes with @xmath527 ,",
    "horizon crossing occurs when the energy density of the universe is dominated by radiation ; thus the fluctuations in the cdm can not grow appreciably during this time .",
    "for the photons and",
    "the baryons , the important scale is the horizon size at recombination ( @xmath553 ) : @xmath554 mpc@xmath6 . the modes with @xmath555 ( see figs .  [",

    "the coupling is not perfect .",
    "the friction of the photons dragging against the baryons leads to silk damping ( silk 1968 ) , which is prominent in figure  [ fig : del]c at @xmath556 .",
    "the baryons decouple from the photons at recombination and then fall very quickly into the potential wells formed around the cdm , resulting in the rapid growth of @xmath549 in figures  [ fig : del]b and [ fig : del]c .",

    "close inspection of the figures at @xmath561 reveals that @xmath550 ( short - dashed curve ) is indeed making a gradual transition from the upper line for the radiation fields to the lower line for the matter fields .",
    "although the jeans length of a fluid is not well defined for collisionless particles such as the neutrinos , the criterion for free - streaming damping is similar to the jeans criterion for gravitational stability : free - streaming is important for @xmath562 , where @xmath563 and @xmath564 is the median neutrino speed . when the neutrinos are relativistic , @xmath565 and @xmath566 for @xmath567 .",
    "after the neutrinos become non - relativistic , the median neutrino speed is @xmath568 km s@xmath6 . in the matter - dominated era , we have @xmath569 from the friedmann equation , and therefore @xmath570 in figure  [ fig : del]a , since horizon crossing occurs when the free - streaming effect is already unimportant , the evolution of @xmath550 is very similar to that of cdm . in figures  [ fig : del]b and [ fig : del]c , however , the free streaming effect is evident and the growth of @xmath550 is suppressed until @xmath571 grows to @xmath572 .",
    "after @xmath573 , @xmath550 can grow again and catch up to @xmath233 .",
    "since @xmath574 , the larger @xmath44 modes suffer more free - streaming damping and @xmath550 can not grow until later times .",
    "the damping in @xmath550 also affects the growth of @xmath233 , slowing it down more for larger @xmath575 compared to the pure cdm model .",
    "this effect is apparent in the @xmath509 power spectra of the pure cdm and the two cdm+hdm models in figure  [ fig : pow ] .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> this paper presents a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar gravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the conformal newtonian ( or longitudinal ) gauge . </S>",
    "<S> it differs from others in the literature in that we give , in both gauges , a complete discussion of all particle species that are relevant to any flat cold dark matter ( cdm ) , hot dark matter ( hdm ) , or cdm+hdm models ( including a possible cosmological constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> the particles considered include cdm , baryons , photons , massless neutrinos , and massive neutrinos ( an hdm candidate ) , where the cdm and baryons are treated as fluids while a detailed phase - space description is given to the photons and neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> particular care is applied to the massive neutrino component , which has been either ignored or approximated crudely in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> isentropic initial conditions on super - horizon scales are derived . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled , linearized boltzmann , einstein and fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric and density perturbations are then solved numerically in both gauges for the standard cdm model and two cdm+hdm models with neutrino mass densities @xmath0 and 0.3 , assuming a scale - invariant , adiabatic spectrum of primordial fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we also give the full details of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy , and present the first accurate calculations of the angular power spectra in the two cdm+hdm models including photon polarization , higher neutrino multipole moments , and helium recombination . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical programs for both gauges are available at http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics .    </S>",
