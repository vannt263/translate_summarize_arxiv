    "the space - dependent spin dynamics in ferromagnetic metals have been the subject of considerable investigation over the past several years .",
    "this subject is of great significance for technological applications such as spin - transfer torque random - access memory ( stt - ram ) and microwave generators or detectors . in the spintronics devices , which are nanoscale magnetic multilayer systems ,",
    "inhomogeneous magnetization dynamics are caused by an external applied field or thermal excitations due to the finite size effects@xcite and the interface effects @xcite .",
    "the spin torques , which arise in non - equilibrium conditions include some terms with different forms @xcite , and the space - dependent spin torques caused by inhomogeneous magnetization dynamics are different from the current - induced spin torques , namely , the spin transfer torque@xcite and the spin - orbit torque @xcite .",
    "the former torque is due to the indirect interaction between magnetization through conduction electrons , while the latter torque is due to the direct interaction between magnetization and conduction electrons .",
    "generally , the space - dependent torque acting on magnetization at @xmath2 can be represented by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the spin susceptibility tensor ( in detail , see ) .",
    "we are interested in the dynamic part of this torque , which describes the interaction between magnetization @xmath5 and the time - derivative of other magnetization @xmath6 , and it corresponds to gilbert damping torque @xmath7 when magnetization precesses uniformly , where @xmath8 is the gilbert damping constant@xcite .",
    "although a large number of studies have considered magnetization damping in uniform precession systems @xcite ( i.e. , local damping ) , little is known about the damping mechanism in inhomogeneous magnetization dynamics@xcite ( i.e. , nonlocal damping ) .",
    "owing to the development of recent experimental techniques , detailed and unified theories of nonlocal damping are more desirable for spintronics applications .",
    "previous theoretical studies show that magnetic damping arising from spin diffusion is enhanced by the spin wave that describes the plane wave dynamics of magnetization@xcite .",
    "the damping coefficient is represented by @xmath9 , especially in the long wavelength limit , where the first term represents damping for uniform precession systems and the second term is the contribution from spin wave motion with wave vector @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath11 is the diffusion constant , which depends strongly on the lifetime of the conduction electrons .",
    "moreover , experimental evidence for nonlocal damping has been reported by the recent work @xcite , where the gilbert damping constants for two modes ( center mode and edge mode ) depend on the size of the nanoscale magnets , implying that additional damping torque was caused by finite size effects .",
    "the purpose of our work is to calculate the dynamic part of the spin torque induced by the spin wave motion of magnetization in a rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) system .",
    "no previous studies have discussed the inhomogeneous magnetization dynamics in soc systems . in our previous work@xcite",
