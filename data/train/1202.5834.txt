    "however , in this work , we just measured a lattice data on a set of quark mass , so we must take an alternative approach . as we discussed in section  [ subsec : scattering_phase ] , we parameterize the resonant characteristic of the @xmath23 using the effective @xmath222 coupling constant @xmath30 , namely , @xmath223 where @xmath221 is the resonance mass .    according to the discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can reasonably assume that the coupling constant @xmath30 is a constant since it changes quite slowly as the quark mass varies .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq : tandel_g ] ) allows us to solve for two unknown parameters : the coupling constant @xmath30 , and resonance mass @xmath224 .",
    "the discretization error may arise from the choice of @xmath28 and @xmath85 .",
    "fortunately , our lattice results show that this does not cause a serious problem numerically . in table  [",
    "table : tandel ] we present the momentum @xmath225 evaluated by @xmath226 .",
    "we notice that the difference between @xmath85 and @xmath225 is not considerable .",
    "thus , we can ignore this systemic error for the current study .",
    "actually , we use the momentum @xmath225 when applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : tandel_g ] ) .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath30 and the resonance mass @xmath221 solved by eq .  ( [ eq : tandel_g ] ) read @xmath227 where we utilize the eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp_two_cont_k ] ) . if we employ the eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp_two_lat_k ] ) , we achieve @xmath228 the value of the coupling constant @xmath30 is in reasonable agreement with @xmath229 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath230  @xcite and @xmath231  @xcite .    in figure  [ fig : sin2del ] , we display the curves for @xmath232 solved by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tandel_g ] ) with the coupling constant @xmath30 and the resonance mass @xmath221 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalr_cont ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalr_lat ] ) , respectively .",
    "the position of the resonance mass @xmath221 ( at @xmath233 ) are also displayed in figure  [ fig : sin2del ] for two cases ( black cross and red plus for the continuum and lattice cases , respectively ) . for visualized comparison",
    ", we also draw the sigma mass @xmath31 ( fancy cyan plus ) , which is in reasonable agreement with the @xmath224 .",
    "supposing that the quark dependence of @xmath30 is quite small  @xcite , we can roughly calculate @xmath0 meson decay width at the physical point as @xmath234 where @xmath235 mev is the estimated physical @xmath0 meson mass taken from pdg  @xcite , and momentum @xmath236 is calculated by @xmath237 where @xmath238 is physical pion mass ( @xmath239 mev )  @xcite .",
    "this produces @xmath240 where we use the data given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalr_cont ] ) , and @xmath241 where we employ the data given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalr_lat ] ) .",
    "we can observe that the difference stemming from two choices of the energy - momentum relations is larger than with the statistical error .",
    "although our preliminary estimates for the @xmath4 decay width in this work is not within the pdg estimated result @xmath242mev  @xcite , this is still an inspiring result , considering that we make a big assumption about the coupling constant does not depend on the quark mass , an perform a long chiral extrapolation , etc .    in the present study , we make an extensive use of the rbwf .",
    "it is well - known that the sigma meson is a very wide object and the rbwf approximation holds perfectly for relatively narrower objects . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we should adopt a much more model - independent approach to the extraction of the finite volume limit . in refs .",
    "@xcite , oset et al . pointed out that if we have got three energies in the cubic box , with the momentum @xmath243 and @xmath244 different of zero , we can still use the finite volume formulas to get the phase shifts in a correct manner .",
    "alternative methods are also discussed in these references . in our future tasks",
    ", we must address the phenomenological treatment .",
    "in this work , we have carried out a lattice calculation of the @xmath1-wave @xmath3 scattering phase shift for isospin @xmath245 channel near @xmath0-meson resonance with total non - zero momentum in one mf , for milc `` medium '' coarse ( @xmath246 fm ) lattice ensemble .",
    "we employed the technique in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely , the moving wall source without gauge fixing for the @xmath245 channel to obtain the reliable precision .",
    "we have demonstrated that the phase shift data clearly shows the presence of a resonance at a mass around @xmath0 meson mass .",
    "moreover , we extracted @xmath0 meson decay width from the phase shift data and showed that it is fairly compared with the corresponding pdg estimation  @xcite .",
    "we adopted the erf , which allows us to use the effective @xmath4 coupling constant @xmath30 to extrapolate our lattice simulation point @xmath20 to the physical point @xmath247 , assuming that @xmath30 is independent of quark mass .",
    "this is just a rough estimation .",
    "we are planning to improve it .",
    "when our preliminary lattice results reported here are compared with its pdg quantities , it is clear that the lattice simulations is just rough estimation , and even can not be considered to be``physical '' one .",
    "so we view our rudimentary works presented here as stepping out a first step to the study of @xmath0 resonance from lattice qcd .",
    "we are grateful to milc collaboration for using asqtad lattice ensemble and milc codes",
    ". we should thank eulogio oset for their encouraging and critical comments .",
