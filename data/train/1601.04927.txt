    "the quantum confinement of superconductors has historically attracted considerable interest , as a plausible route to increase the critical temperature through the enhancement of the fermi - level density of states in reduced dimensions . among the factors that influence the critical properties , dimensionality and geometry are appealing , being easier to manipulate than the microscopic parameters of the materials .",
    "new fascinating phenomena have been predicted to occur in confined geometries : for instance , thompson and blatt @xcite , followed by many others until recently @xcite , predicted large oscillations of the critical temperature @xmath0 in superconducting films , as a function of the film thickness .",
    "the oscillations known as `` shape resonances '' arise when the fermi level crosses the edge of one of the confinement - induced subbands .",
    "early experimental studies with disordered thin films revealed significant enhancements of @xmath0 in al and ga , but little or no enhancement in sn , in , and pb @xcite .",
    "measurements made on epitaxial films and islands showed instead no noticeable change of @xmath0 in al with respect to the bulk value @xcite , and a decrease in bi , in , and pb @xcite , as well as in nbn @xcite .",
    "oscillations of @xmath0 as a function of film thickness were seen in sn @xcite , and more recently in pb @xcite .",
    "last but not least , a spectacular enhancement of @xmath0 was recently observed in a monolayer of fese grown on srtio@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a common trend of these experiments is that oscillations of @xmath0 as a function of film thickness are either below the level of noise or , when they are seen , much smaller than the oscillations typically reported in theoretical studies .",
    "the calculations published so far for ideal thin films show discontinuous jumps of @xmath0 with relative amplitudes which can be as large as 100% at low thickness , while the strongest oscillations seen experimentally hardly exceed 15% @xcite .",
    "such theoretical results are obtained by solving the bcs gap equation approximately , with a thickness - dependent fermi - level density of states ( dos ) , which has discontinuities at the edge of each subband .",
    "these dos discontinuities are responsible for the large jumps in @xmath0 .",
    "extrinsic effects such as an interaction with the substrate have been invoked to explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment @xcite . in a previous paper ( denoted part  i hereafter )",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the bcs gap equation predicts a continuous evolution of @xmath0 when the fermi energy approaches a band minimum . in view of this , discontinuities in @xmath0 are an artifact of replacing the energy - dependent dos by a dos which is constant over the full dynamical range of the pairing interaction .",
    "this approximation breaks down when the interaction is cut by the band edge . in the bcs theory ,",
    "the actual dependence of @xmath0 on film thickness must therefore be continuous , and the previously reported large oscillations must be replaced by a smoother evolution . in the present paper , we unveil the precise shape of the @xmath2 curve predicted by the bcs gap equation for ideal thin films of thickness @xmath3 , and we interpret the numerical results with the help of exact asymptotic formulas derived in part  i.    beside the oscillations , the overall trend of @xmath0 with reducing thickness is of particular interest .",
    "thompson and blatt @xcite found an increase , but their model assumed hard - wall boundary conditions for the wave functions .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite noticed that the leakage of the wave functions outside the film reduces the pairing strength within the film , and they proposed a phenomenological model to account for this effect , which can produce a _ decrease _ of @xmath0 with decreasing @xmath3 . this phenomenological description may be improved and challenged by calculating the pairing matrix elements with the exact wave functions of a finite potential well .",
    "this program was followed by bianconi and coworkers in a series of papers @xcite where they considered a periodic arrangement describing a multilayer .",
    "here we consider a single well as a model for a thin film .",
    "we thus find two regimes for the confinement potential . below a certain critical potential",
    ", @xmath0 goes down with reducing @xmath3 while if the confinement is stronger than the critical value , @xmath0 increases until it reaches a maximum at a parameter - dependent thickness , before dropping rapidly to zero .",
    "the existence of a critical confinement potential  below which no enhancement of the critical temperature is to be expected  may help to understand the contrasting experimental results obtained with different thin films .",
    "it was recently found that ultrathin pb films deposited on si(111 ) have a @xmath0 lower than bulk pb , with a nonmonotonic dependence on the film thickness @xcite .",
    "the authors tentatively ascribed this to an interaction with the substrate . based on our calculations ,",
    "we propose a semiquantitative interpretation in terms of an effective mass which increases significantly in ultrathin films .",
    "another system of interest is the two - dimensional electron gas at the laalo@xmath1/srtio@xmath1 interface , which enters a superconducting phase at a density - dependent temperature slightly lower than the @xmath0 of bulk srtio@xmath1 @xcite . whether or not this interface superconductivity has the same origin as in bulk srtio@xmath1 , and whether it can be understood by the confinement of srtio@xmath1 carriers ,",
    "remain important open issues @xcite .",
    "the investigation of this case requires to consider a multiband system .",
    "we defer it to an upcoming study and focus here on the one - band problem .    in sec .",

    "one may question the relevance of a continuous free - electron - like weak - coupling model for representing realistic thin films .",
    "while the limitations of this model are obvious , we have shown that it provides a description of the evolution of @xmath0 with thickness for thin films of pb on si(111 ) with reasonable parameters .",
    "this strengthens our confidence that the model may perhaps be useful for other systems as well .",
    "we thank j. m. triscone and s. gariglio for stimulating discussions .",

    "to begin with , we consider electrons interacting via a generic two - body interaction @xmath224 where the greek letters denote single - particle states with wave functions @xmath225 , etc . decoupling this interaction in the usual way",
    ", we derive gorkov equations which we then linearize at @xmath0 in order to obtain a gap equation expressed in the generic single - particle basis .",
    "this gap equation is @xmath226.\\ ] ] @xmath227 is the single - particle energy measured from the chemical potential and @xmath228 is the fermi distribution . at this point",
    "we specialize to a bcs - like interaction which is local , acts between pairs of time - reversed states denoted @xmath229 with @xmath230 , and has a separable energy cutoff : @xmath231 @xmath232 gives the strength of the local pairing , the function @xmath233 implements the energy cutoff , and the overlap integrals are defined as @xmath234 .",
    "the order parameter is nonzero only for time - reversed pairs , @xmath235 , and the following equation for the gap parameters results from ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : a2 ] ) : @xmath236 we now apply this to a quasi - two - dimensional geometry with translation invariance in the @xmath237 plane , and some potential well in the region around @xmath238 .",
    "the potential is such that all states with energy larger than @xmath47 are scattering states .",
    "the wave functions can be taken as @xmath239 with @xmath240 the system size in the @xmath237 plane .",
    "if the gap parameter is independent of the in - plane momentum @xmath241 , the in - plane momentum sum in ( [ eq : a3 ] ) can be expressed in terms of the 2d dos , leading to @xmath242 we want to separate the @xmath243 sum into bound and scattering states . whenever @xmath42 and/or @xmath243 corresponds to a scattering state ,",
    "the overlap integral @xmath46 is proportional to @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the system size in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "we can take this factor away from the definition of the overlap , and use it to convert the sum over scattering states into an integral . at this stage",
    "we assume that the gap parameter is the same for all scattering states , @xmath246 , and likewise the overlap @xmath247 ; this is not true in general , as discussed further below .",
    "we moreover assume that the dos of the scattering states is not significantly modified by the formation of bound states . using the letters @xmath42 and @xmath243 for bound states , and the letter @xmath248 for scattering states , eq .",
    "( [ eq : a4 ] ) becomes @xmath249 the sum over scattering states has been recast in terms of the 3d dos . in the second relation , the coupling between scattering and bound states has disappeared , because the overlap @xmath250 is summed over a finite number of bound states , and the resulting contribution drops in the thermodynamic limit . moving on to dimensionless variables and proceeding like in part  i",
    ", we find that the equation for @xmath0 in the presence of scattering states is once again of the form @xmath251 $ ] , but the matrix @xmath31 must be augmented by one line and one column in order to account for scattering states .",
    "the matrix elements are      @xmath37 is the 3d coupling and @xmath33 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdaqp ] ) . for a square potential",
    "well of width @xmath3 and depth @xmath47 , we find that the overlap @xmath253 is a function of the energies @xmath254 and @xmath255 in the thermodynamic limit",
    ". this function approaches unity for all @xmath255 when @xmath254 approaches @xmath47 . for smaller values of @xmath254 ,",
    "the function is unity at large @xmath255 but decreases to zero with @xmath3-dependent oscillations at small @xmath255 . in line with our assumption that all scattering states share the same gap",
    ", we must replace @xmath253 by a single value which is representative of all bound and scattering states . for simplicity , we choose the value @xmath256 , which is the limit for large @xmath255 . for the scattering states ,",
    "we find @xmath257 for all states .",
    "in addition to changing the equation for @xmath0 , the scattering states also give to the electron density a small contribution which must be considered for the determination of the self - consistent chemical potential . in first approximation ,",
    "the density contributed by the scattering states is that of a 3d electron gas with chemical potential @xmath258 .",
    "we must , however , handle carefully the situation where a new state comes out of the continuum and localizes into the well , for instance while varying the well thickness @xmath3 .",
    "this process is in principle smooth , but with our approximations , which neglect the distortion of scattering states due to the potential well , it is not : when a new state enters the well , it makes a discontinuous contribution to the density of states such that the self - consistent chemical potential jumps to a lower value in order to keep the total density fixed . to avoid this jump",
    ", we continue the localized state into the continuum and take its contribution into account before it gets localized , on top of the contribution of the other scattering states . the correction to the density in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bcsb ] ) is therefore @xmath259+@xmath260 , where @xmath261 is the density of a free - electron gas in dimension @xmath262 with chemical potential @xmath6 , and @xmath263 is the continuation of the bound - state energy in the continuum .",
    "this function must start at @xmath264 , decrease as a state approaches the well , and reach zero when the state enters the well .",
