    "since the discovery of the first extragalactic large - scale jet in a nearby active galaxy m  87 @xcite , intense efforts are made to explore the underlying physics of the relativistic jets during the past decades .",
    "the related topics concern about the matter content , particle acceleration , collimation mechanism and magnetic field configuration inside the jet flow . among these problems ,",
    "one of the fundamental issues is the intrinsic velocity field of the jet .",
    "lack of an effective method to determine the speed and orientation of the successive regions in large - scale jet , it is difficult to constrain further the mechanism on overall dynamics of the bulk jet flow .    in this work ,",
    "a new method is presented to estimate the doppler beaming factor in a region of large - scale jet .",
    "this method is based on the spectral fit of the multi - waveband continua with standard synchrotron radiation models . combining the data of proper motions ,",
    "we readily derive the intrinsic bulk velocity as well as the angle to line - of - sight of the jet flow . making application of this new method ,",
    "we successfully obtain the intrinsic velocity field in m  87 jet .",
    "our result agrees well with that of the new variability monitoring program toward the same object @xcite , which indicates the reliability of our approach .",
    "the method is simple and only requires non - simultaneous spectral energy distribution ( sed ) data sets , therefore is hopeful to be of general interest for those synchrotron - dominated jets .    for the rest of this paper",
    ", we firstly make synchrotron spectrum model fitting to radio - to - x - ray sed of m87 jet in  2 , then introduce the new method and derive the distribution of doppler beaming factor along m  87 jet in  3 . coupling the data of proper motions , we obtain the intrinsic velocity field of m87 jet in  4 .",
    "related discussions are also presented in this section .",
    "finally , the main results are summarized in  5 .",
    "the high spatial resolution of _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( fwhm = 0.5 ) has opened a new era on the research of extragalactic large - scale jets at high energy waveband . at the time of preparing this paper , 91 radio - loud agns are reported detection of x - ray counterparts of radio jets on large - scales ( see also http://hea-www.harvard.edu/xjet/ ) .",
    "the number of detected x - ray jets increases rapidly , suggesting that x - ray emission from jets is a common feature in radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "if combined with observational data in radio and optical band ( sometimes also with available infrared and ultraviolet data ) , we can construct broadband sed and carry out multi - waveband modelling of the jet regions .",
    "such a procedure may provide us with useful information of jet physics .",
    "polarization observations already confirm the synchrotron nature of the radio - optical emissions from extragalactic jets ( e.g. , @xcite for m  87 jet ) .",
    "the x - ray emission process of large - scale jets , however , remains as an open question . for nearby fr",
    "i radio galaxies , the radio - to - x - ray sed from the large - scale knots is consistent with a single smoothly broken power - law spectrum , and the expected inverse - compton scattering ( ic ) fluxes of seed photons ( jet synchrotron photons or cosmic microwave background photons ) always underpredict the observed x - ray fluxes .",
    "this implies the synchrotron origin of the x - ray emissions observed in fr  i jets ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for m  87 , @xcite for 3c  66b ) .",
    "the recent statistical research of a large x - ray jet sample @xcite also favors this physical picture . on the other hand , the x - ray emissions from large - scale quasar and",
    "fr  ii jets , however , are usually interpreted as inverse - compton scattering of cmb photons within a highly relativistic jet @xcite .    as discussed by @xcite , the ic / cmb model for the x - ray emissions of large - scale quasar jets",
    "predicts two main differences between nearby and distant objects . due to the enhancement of the cmb energy density with redshift by a factor of @xmath3 ,",
    "the ratio of x - ray to radio fluxes of the resolved parts of the quasar jets should increase in distant sources compared to nearby ones .",
    "the other effect is that we should observe some systematic flattening of the optical - to - x - ray spectral index ( @xmath4 ) in distant unresolved quasar cores compared to low - redshift quasars , because of the increasing contribution from the unresolved portions of the jet to the x - ray flux of the quasar core .",
    "we notice , however , the recent observational efforts of @xcite to search the latter effect .",
    "they carry out a _",
    "snapshot survey of representative high - redshift radio - loud quasars ( @xmath5 ) selected from the parkes - mit - nrao sample .",
    "the survey does not detect any systematic flattening of the optical - to - x - ray spectral index ( @xmath6 ) of the unresolved quasar cores compared to low - redshift quasars .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that kiloparsec - scale x - ray emission of quasar jet is not dominated by inverse compton scattering of cmb seed photons off jet electrons .",
    "meanwhile , the ic / cmb model also meets difficulty in explaining the x - ray emissions from several fr  ii jets ( e.g. , @xcite for 3c  403 ) .",
    "it is also worthy to notice the most recent discovery of the x - ray counterjet in the fr  ii source 3c  353 detected by _",
    "chandra _ @xcite .",
    "the research of @xcite suggests that this detection is inconsistent with the ic / cmb model , and instead implies a synchrotron origin of the x - ray jet photons .",
    "thus , even for powerful quasar / fr  ii jets , the synchrotron radiation mechanism for x - ray photons keeps as a plausible interpretation",
    ".    in general , synchrotron origin for x - ray emission of large - scale jet faces much more strict challenge in particle acceleration than ic / cmb model does .",
    "firstly , the particle acceleration in synchrotron x - ray jets has to be fast enough to generate ultra - relativistic electrons with maximum energies @xmath7  tev ( i.e. , one to two orders of magnitude higher than that required in the ic / cmb model ) .",
    "secondly , the electron acceleration processes in synchrotron x - ray jets have to operate continuously within the whole volumes of the jets .",
    "such a strict requirement that synchrotron x - ray jets should work as powerful particle accelerators is naturally supported by the idea that large - scale jets are very hopeful sites for yielding ultra high energy cosmic ray particles ( uhecrs , see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "based on the observations mentioned above , we choose synchrotron radiation model for our multi - waveband research . currently , there are three standard synchrotron spectrum models available for statistical fit of sed : ( 1 ) the @xcite model ( hereafter jp ) , which assumes the pitch angle distribution of relativistic electrons is continuously isotropized after an initial injection of single power - law electron energy distribution .",
    "( 2 ) the kardashev - pacholczyk model ( @xcite and @xcite , hereafter kp ) , which allows only the evolution of high energy tail of electron energy distribution following an initial single - power law electron injection . since no pitch - angle scattering of the radiating electrons is allowed , it is unlikely to be the real case .",
    "this model , however , can give good fits to the observational data in many cases , therefore is relatively common in the jet research community .",
    "( 3 ) the continuous injection model ( @xcite and @xcite , hereafter ci ) , which allows continuous electron injection with single power - law energy distribution into the emission region .    the spatial extent of the x - ray emitting regions in some fr  i jets resolved by _",
    "_ implies that continuous acceleration and injection of high - energy electrons may occur in these objects . on the other hand ,",
    "recent work of @xcite on m87 jet suggests that jp model underpredicts the x - ray flux by many orders of magnitude and the theoretical slope at x - ray energies is much larger than those observed .",
    "therefore we do not consider the jp model in our work .",
    "all of the multi - band fits are made using kp and ci models .",
    "for all of the synchrotron spectrum models above , the dominated cooling process of high - energy electrons responsible for x - ray emissions should be synchrotron radiative energy loss .",
    "m  87 is one of the nearby fr  i radio galaxies ( distance = 16  mpc , with a scale of 1= 77.6  pc )",
    ". the rich observational data of its famous jet enable us to do further multi - band fit .",
    "the program of synchrotron spectrum fit we use is written by c.  carilli and j.p .",
    "leahy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fit is done in two steps . in step  1 , we get an initial guess of the position of the break frequency by employing a myers and spangler test @xcite on the multi - waveband data sets . then in step  2 , a marquardt non - linear @xmath8 test is done numerically @xcite to reach the best fitting of the sed data .",
    "the tests are model dependent .",
    "the electrons responsible for higher frequency synchrotron radiation suffer more rapid synchrotron loss , thus there is a spectra steepening toward the high frequency band .",
    "for ci model , there is a break in spectral index of @xmath9 between the low and high frequency spectra . in the case of kp model ,",
    "@xmath10 depends on the index of electron energy distribution .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    ", we plot results of ci as well as kp model fitting for the radio - to - x - ray sed of nucleus and eight knotty regions .",
    "it is worth to notice that knot hst-1 has started to flare ( in radio , optical and x - ray waveband ) around 2002 @xcite .",
    "since we aim to do quiescent state fit of the non - simultaneous sed , the broad - band data for this knotty region of m87 jet are carefully selected to be prior to the flare .",
    "the _ vla _",
    "observational data point at 15  ghz is from @xcite , and optical - near - infrared data points are obtained with _",
    "hst _ on 1998 @xcite . as to the x - ray spectrum",
    ", it is from @xcite , which is the reanalysis of early _ chandra _ observations of m87 jet taken on 2000 july @xcite .",
    "the observations above locate prior to the outburst of hst-1 knot .    moreover , @xcite present new ultraviolet _ hst _ observations of m87 jet taken on 2001 february 23 .",
    "their results suggest that knot hst-1 reveals a significant increase in the brightness from late 2001 to the present .",
    "@xcite try to do best fit to the observed radio - to - x - ray sed of hst-1 with standard synchrotron spectrum models , and found the new uv point exceeds the fit by a large amount independent of the models .",
    "their work implies hst-1 knot has started its early evolution of the flare by the time of their observations .",
    "therefore , we include the uv observational data points of @xcite for most m87 jet knots ( no significant variability found up to date ) except hst-1 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     inspection of table  [ table4 ] suggests that the orientation of knot  a depends on the level of departure from equipartition .",
    "if @xmath11 ( small departure ) , its orientation can maintain the same viewing angle with the inner jet , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "meanwhile , larger departure from equipartition ( @xmath13 ) leads to large inclination ( @xmath14 ) consistent with that inferred by @xcite .",
    "based on these results , we argue that the outer jet of m87 starting from knot  a suffers some departure from equipartition .",
    "this departure may result from accumulative mass entrainment during jet propagation .",
    "based on multi - waveband fitting with moderate synchrotron spectrum models and radiation - escape balance at the break frequency , we derive the distribution of doppler beaming factors down m87 jet .",
    "coupling the data of proper motions , the intrinsic velocity and orientation are calculated for eight knotty regions , which presents some hints for the overall dynamics of this famous extragalactic jet .",
    "the main results are summarized as following :    1 .",
    "the derived distribution of doppler beaming factors gives good support to the modest beaming scenario , with @xmath15 varying between @xmath0 .",
    "the bulk flow of m87 jet reveals sharp deceleration at the inner jet , which may be caused by continuous entrainment of external gaseous medium during propagation .",
    "meanwhile , the intrinsic speed of the outer jet remains roughly constant after early deceleration .",
    "3 .   the viewing angles of the inner jet regions are fully consistent with 10 - 19to line - of - sight suggested by previous _ hst _ proper motions study of m87 jet .",
    "the outer jet , however , shows systematic deflection off the inner jet to much smaller inclination ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "further calculation of knot  a suggests this deflection can be regarded as evidence that the outer jet suffers some departure from equipartition .",
    "the nucleus region of m87 jet should have an viewing angle close to its first knot hst-1 , i.e. @xmath2",
    ". then our result favors the idea that m87 may be a misaligned blazar .",
    "we should also comment the recent work of @xcite . using",
    "a relativistic jet model , @xcite try to model the high resolution vla images of five fr  i radio galaxies other than m87 .",
    "they find that a decelerating jet model can fit the observed brightness and polarization structures well .",
    "moreover , they suggest the deceleration is most likely caused by mass entrainment .",
    "their results provide strong support to our result , i.e. the decelerating velocity profile found in typical fr  i jet of m87 is reliable .",
    "once the related jet parameters are derived in table  ( [ table2 ] ) and table  ( [ table3 ] ) , we can estimate the contribution to jet power carried by the radiating electrons and the magnetic field as @xcite @xmath16 where the factor 2 means the total internal energy density is twice of the energy density of equipartition magnetic field . making use of derived parameters of hst-1 knot and the transformation formulae in appendix  a , we get @xmath17 .",
    "our result agrees well with @xmath18 suggested by different methods of previous researches ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another issue we should confirm is whether our derived jet parameters are consistent with the conservation of the magnetic flux along m87 jet . in the jet frame , the magnetic flux @xmath19 . using derived jet parameters in table  ( [ table2 ] ) and",
    "transform with formulae of appendix  a , we can estimate the related magnetic fluxes ( in @xmath20 ) as ( the equipartition level of @xmath21 in outer jet is somewhat uncertain , thus we only give results for inner jet regions ) : @xmath22 ( nucleus ) , @xmath23 ( hst-1 ) , @xmath24 ( d - east ) , @xmath25 ( e ) , and @xmath26 ( f ) .",
    "the results indicate the magnetic fluxes remain roughly conservative down the jet .",
    "finally , we should test the validity of main model assumption on the dominance of synchrotron cooling process . to compare the dominance of synchrotron cooling rate over ssc ( synchrotron self - compton ) cooling rate",
    ", we have the ratio @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the intrinsic energy density of magnetic field .",
    "the local energy density of photon field,@xmath29 , can be estimated with intrinsic total synchrotron luminosity of the jet region , i.e. @xmath30 . making application to the jet parameters and observed total luminosity of jet regions , and transform with appendix  a , we find out the ratio defined in equation  ( [ eq9 ] ) range between @xmath31 along m87 jet .",
    "the results are consistent with the model assumption on the dominance of synchrotron cooling .    meanwhile , for the inner parts of the jet",
    ", the m87 host galaxy may provide relative intense photon field for the ic scattering process , resulting in an additional radiative cooling of the ultra - relativistic electrons .",
    "we should evaluate this possible effect in details .",
    "the star light from m87 host galaxy contributes to the jet as an incident external soft photon field at the optical band . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we assume the external photons have some characteristic frequency @xmath32  hz .",
    "then after external ic scattering ( ec process ) by ultra - relativistic electrons in the jet , the emerged high - energy photons will have some characteristic frequency as @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the lorentz factor of the ultra - relativistic electron , @xmath15 and @xmath35 refer to doppler beaming factor and bulk lorentz factor of the jet flow , respectively .    as to the ultra - relativistic electrons responsible for synchrotron x - ray emissions in large - scale jets ,",
    "their typical energy should be @xmath36 or even higher . according to our inferred jet parameters of m87 , we find @xmath37 for the inner jet regions .",
    "therefore , the resulting high - energy photons from ec process locate around @xmath38  hz , which falls in the tev energy band .",
    "the result above suggests that significant ec cooling of ultra - relativistic electrons from the host galaxy will predict significant contribution to the observed tev spectra of m87 .",
    "however , detailed study of @xcite implies that the large - scale knots are unlikely to be the site for the tev emissions recently detected in m87 . through modelling of the core jet of m87",
    ", @xcite do not also find evidence of significant contribution to tev emissions from ec process of m87 host galaxy .",
    "therefore , we argue that the synchrotron cooling dominated assumption of the model should hold in the inner jet regions of m87 .    during the preparation of this paper",
    ", we notice the latest work of @xcite on m87 jet knots .",
    "an improved two - zone ( emission region and nearby acceleration region ) ci synchrotron model is presented by @xcite , very similar to the work of @xcite . both of the modified ci models can fit the broad - band sed much better than standard synchrotron models for most of the m87 jet knots .",
    "we comment , however , another possibility for further improvement of the model .",
    "all of the current synchrotron models only consider synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons spiralling in an uniform magnetic field , which is unlikely to be the real case .",
    "it is generally believed that large - scale jet knots are places of strong shocks , where ultrarelativistic electrons are accelerated via the first - order fermi process ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is no strong evidence to support the suggestion that the magnetic field lines behind the shock front are straight and uniform .",
    "the structure of the magnetic field may be highly tangled , composed of curved magnetic field lines with different scales of radius .    on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical researches on synchrotron radiation in curved magnetic field lines ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; the mechanism is named synchro - curvature radiation by the authors ) suggest that the curvature of magnetic field lines plays an important role in the spectral slope of the synchrotron spectrum , i.e. at the high - energy portion of the sed .",
    "recently , such a new mechanism was used to explain successfully the high - energy excess of several gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; @xcite ) the broad - band emission of which may also originate from relativistic jets . since standard synchrotron models show systematic deviation from the observed x - ray spectra of m87 jet knots , it would be interesting also to explore the effect of curvature of magnetic field lines on the broad - band sed of the m87 jet and other objects in possible future work .",

    ", the synchrotron cooling time at the break frequency can be expressed as @xcite @xmath41 where the equipartition magnetic field @xmath42 , is in @xmath43 g , and the break frequency @xmath44 , is in ghz .",
    "while performing lorentz transformation from jet frame ( primed ) to the observer frame ( unprimed ) , the break frequency transforms as ( see formula ( c6 ) of @xcite ) @xmath45 meanwhile , we use equation ( a8 ) of @xcite to transform the equipartition value of the magnetic field , which corrects the formula ( a7 ) of @xcite .",
    "the transformation is expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the equipartition magnetic field calculated for no beaming ( @xmath48 ) .      on the other hand , in the jet rest frame , @xmath50 .",
    "therefore we have the volume of the blob @xmath51 . for the assumed geometry of the knot , the spatial scale of interest in the escape timescale is @xmath52 .",
    "then we rewrite the form of escape timescale @xcite in the jet rest frame as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a dimensionless parameter , and @xmath55 is speed of light in @xmath56 .      as to m87 jet",
    ", we have fwhm measurement of the major axis ( @xmath58 ) and minor axis ( @xmath59 ) for the jet knots from high resolution imaging observations by _ chandra _ @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can use the quantity @xmath60 ( in arcsec ) to estimate the mean angular diameter of the region , which in turn gives average observed radius @xmath61 with the known distance of the object .",
    "the projection scale of m87 jet is 1= 77.6  pc , thus @xmath62    at the break frequency of the synchrotron spectrum , the synchrotron cooling time equals to the escape time of electrons from the main emission blob ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "when we equal the right side of equation ( [ a4 ] ) and ( [ a6 ] ) , and rewrite @xmath63 in hz , the final formula of @xmath15 can be easily expressed as @xmath64"

    "<S> a new method to estimate the doppler beaming factor of relativistic large - scale jet regions is presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on multiwaveband fitting to radio - to - x - ray continua with synchrotron spectrum models . combining our method with available observational data of proper motions , we derive the intrinsic velocity as well as the viewing angles to the line of sight for eight knotty regions down the m87 jet . </S>",
    "<S> the results favor the modest beaming scenario along the jet , with doppler factors varying between @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the inner jet of m87 suffers sharp deceleration , and the intrinsic speed remains roughly constant down the outer jet . </S>",
    "<S> the orientation of the inner jet regions is fully consistent with the result of 10 - 19to the line of sight suggested by previous _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> ( _ hst _ ) proper motion studies of the m87 jet . </S>",
    "<S> the outer jet , however , shows systematic deflection off the inner jet to much smaller inclination ( @xmath1 ) . further calculation of knot  a suggests this deflection can be regarded as evidence that the outer jet suffers some departure from equipartition . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus region of the m87 jet should have a viewing angle close to its first knot hst-1 , i.e. @xmath2 , which favors the idea that m87 may be a misaligned blazar . </S>",
