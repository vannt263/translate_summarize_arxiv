    "nonlinear wave propagation in optical media is normally the result of a certain balance between dispersion / diffraction and nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "this balance can lead to special structure formations which are termed solitons or solitary waves . while these structures are proven to be very stable , the necessary balance needed to form them is not always achieved . as a result ,",
    "due to the dominance of dispersive / diffractive spreading or nonlinear focusing an unwanted growth of initial waves can be observed .",
    "this amplitude modulation is widely known and studied in the context of nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) systems @xcite .",
    "the nls system , however , for several physically relevant contexts turns out to be an oversimplified description as it can not model , for example , gain and loss which are inevitable in any physical system @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to model important classes of physical systems in a relevant way , it is necessary to go beyond the standard nls description . to this end",
    "it is important to consider adding higher - order terms into the nls equation , so as to accurately describe waves in dissipative nonlinear systems .",
    "in fact , for specific classes of these higher - order terms terms the resulting system may still be integrable @xcite and one can utilize the mathematical tools also provided for the simple nls case .    in some physical systems simply adding higher order and/or dissipative terms will not result in a better description of their properties .",
    "these are , for example , systems with different nonlinear response such as nonlocal .",
    "nonlocality refers to the reorientational response of the medium to the pulses having a width much greater than the width of the light beams .",
    "one of the most interesting materials with nonlocal nonlinear response are nematic liquid crystals . in this context",
    ", nonlocality is highly tuneable and solitons , termed nematicons , have been observed induced by a regular local nonlinearity , a nonlocal nonlinearity or a combination of both @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nonlinear nonlocal equations similar to those governing nematicons have been found to govern solitary waves in other media , for instance , colloidal @xcite , thermal @xcite , photorefractive @xcite and plasmas @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental effects of wave propagation in nonlinear media is modulation instability ( mi ) .",
    "mi was first described in the context of water waves and is referred to as the benjamin - feir instability @xcite .",
    "this is the instability of nonlinear plane waves against small perturbations resulting in their exponential growth .",
    "it has been observed experimentally and identified mathematically in various physical applications ( other than water waves ) @xcite .",
    "much like soliton ( or coherent structure ) formation , mi exists due to the interplay between nonlinearity and dispersion / diffraction .",
    "thus , it highly depends on the nature of the nonlinearity , e.g. cubic , quartic , saturable , nonlocal , etc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect is significantly enhanced in coupled systems @xcite .",
    "we intend to examine the effects of mi in nonlocal media and in particular in two - color nematicons . in these media ( in the scalar case ) , the nonlocal term seems to suppress the growth rate and the overall effect of mi @xcite .",
    "in addition , exact stationary ( soliton ) solutions of the coupled equation may still exist under specific requirements .",
    "these are termed paired solitons since they specify the intensity profiles of both beams and occur in pairs @xcite .",
    "the article is divided in sections as follows : in section 2 we define the equations that govern propagation in these media and perform the mi analysis .",
    "interestingly , we find that the stability criteria are similar to those of the relative nls system and do not depend on the nonlocal parameter .",
    "we also identify two critical values : the maximum growth rate and the critical wavenumber which defines the range of wavenumber that can induce the instability . by doing so",
    ", we also identify a critical value for the nonlocality which corresponds to the minimum value needed to stabilize a continuous wave of specific wavenumber . in section 3 ,",
    "the soliton solutions are discussed and appropriate conditions that relate the relative amplitudes , in order for undistorted evolution to occur , are derived .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section 4 .",
    "the governing equations that describe two polarised , coherent light beams of two different wavelengths propagating through a cell filled with a nematic liquid crystal read , in non - dimensional form @xcite , @xmath0 the variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the complex valued , slowly varying envelopes of the optical electric fields and @xmath3 is the optically induced deviation of the director angle .",
    "diffraction is represented by @xmath4 and nonlinearity by @xmath5 .",
    "importantly , these variables are allowed to vary their signs while all other constants are taken positive .",
    "when the signs of diffraction and nonlinearity are opposite , i.e. @xmath6 , the system is termed defocusing and focusing otherwise .",
    "the location of the relative signs is not important ; multiplying eqs .",
    "( [ nem1])([nem2 ] ) by @xmath7 and changing @xmath8 moves the sign difference from one place to the other .",
    "the nonlocality @xmath9 measures the strength of the response of the nematic in space , with a highly nonlocal response corresponding to @xmath9 large .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is related to the square of the applied static field which pre - tilts the nematic dielectric @xcite .",
    "note , that the above system corresponds to the nonlocal regime with @xmath9 large , where the optically induced rotation @xmath3 is small @xcite .",
    "we will be using dimensionless parameters here because the system above may also be used to describe light propagation in nonlocal media , in general .",
    "for nematic crystals , in particular , @xmath11 are @xmath12 while @xmath9 is @xmath13 @xcite .    in order to investigate the mi of a pair of coupled waves we first consider the continuous wave ( cw ) solution of eqs .",
    "( [ nem1])([nem3 ] ) , i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are real constants .",
    "now consider a small perturbation to this cw solution @xmath17e^{2i g_1 \\theta_0 z},\\quad v(z , x)=[v_0 + v_1(z , x)]e^{2i g_2 \\theta_0 z } \\label{eq0}\\ ] ] which we insert into the system ( [ nem1])([nem3 ] ) . in order to simplify the analysis",
    "we first solve eqs .",
    "( [ nem1])([nem2 ] ) for @xmath3 and substitute in eq .",
    "( [ nem3 ] ) . while this eliminates one dependent variable it raises the overall order of the system and as such it only proves useful in the mi analysis where plane wave solutions are investigated ( as solutions of a linear system ) . when solitons or exact solutions are the object of the analysis this is not recommended .",
    "the linearized equations ( where terms of order @xmath18 and @xmath19 or higher have been neglected ) for the small perturbing terms are found to be @xmath20 notice that the terms involving @xmath9 , that induce the nonlocality , are higher order derivatives ; without these terms the problem simply reduces to the linearized nls problem .",
    "this means that their contribution is expected to be highly nontrivial , as they produce higher order polynomials in the dispersion relation ; the effect of these terms will become more prominent below .",
    "( [ lin1])([lin2 ] ) admit solutions of the form @xmath21 provided the dispersion relationship @xmath22 with @xmath23 eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) is a bi - quadratic and can be solved analytically to produce @xmath24 as @xmath25 mi will be exhibited when this @xmath26 has complex solutions : their imaginary part , im@xmath27 , will give the relative growth rate , as suggested by eq .",

    "( [ disp ] ) only admits real solutions , thus avoiding any exponential growth .",
    "in particular , there are three polynomials in @xmath28 which one needs to prove are positive @xcite",
    ". this will provide the appropriate conditions for stability .",

    "this is obtained through sturm s theorem @xcite ; since the coefficients of the highest order terms are positive and of even degree , it is sufficient to demand that these polynomials do not exhibit real roots .",

    "this is a major difference between this system and the coupled nls equations ( with arbitrary coefficients ) @xcite .",
    "the nls system is richer in dynamics , as stability may also be obtained even when one of the equations is focusing , or in contrast , the system may be unstable in the purely defocusing regime .",

    "the case @xmath47 simplifies the analysis above significantly as the signs of the relative polynomials are easier to find .",
    "the interesting observation is that while the above results still hold in this case , the numeric value of @xmath47 becomes irrelevant and only its sign is important .",
    "also , important is to notice that since these results are independent of the parameter @xmath9 , meaning that the coupled nematicon system and the coupled nls with the appropriate coefficients share the same stability conditions .",
    "the nonlocality does not affect the stability criterion , it only contributes to the growth rate , im@xmath27 , and its effect is to slow down the occurring instability as shown in fig .",

    "then the critical value can be identified as the solution of @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ nonlocal.k ] , we show the dependence of these critical values with the nonlocality @xmath9 .        in particular , for the values of the figures above we find that @xmath56 which also demonstrates the way this value is affected by the nonlocality . the relative @xmath57 ( and from that @xmath58 )",
    "value can be obtained from the solution of the equation @xmath59 .    finally , and following the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite one can seek the critical value of the nonlocality parameter that stabilizes a cw of particular wavenumber .",
    "this is retrieved again from eq .",
    "( [ critical ] ) only now we solve for @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath60 for example , for the values as above , the wave number @xmath61 will always correspond to a stable cw iff @xmath62 , as also confirmed by figs .",
    "[ growth.nu ] and [ nonlocal.k ] .",
    "this critical value is not a general criterion for stability as it depends on the particular wavenumber .",
    "this means that while the particular critical value of @xmath9 may stabilize a specific wavenumber another value will render the system unstable , consistently with the analysis above .",
    "only when the system is full defocusing mi is absent .",
    "the dynamics of two - color nematicons propagation and interactions in the nonlocal limit is usually studied using variational method based on an appropriate trial function / anzatz whose parameters ( amplitude , width , etc ) are chosen so that the lagrangian of the system is minimized @xcite . however , since these are not exacts solutions they are expected to shed diffractive radiation much like the solutions of the regular nls system .",
    "we intend to remedy this by finding exact solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ nem1])([nem3 ] ) and the conditions associated with these solutions .    as seen above the coupled system is , in the focusing case , unstable .",
    "this means that any initial condition is subject to instability .",
    "thus , it is natural to seek conditions under which soliton solutions may exist that will not undergo the instability process . to find these solutions ( if they exist ) , we assume that the stationary solutions of the system ( [ nem1])([nem3 ] ) take the form @xmath63 substituting directly into eqs .",
    "( [ nem1])([nem3 ] ) , we obtain the expressions for the soliton parameters : @xmath64 the solitons amplitudes are related through @xmath65 subject to the condition @xmath66 although the freedom of one free parameter ( which also relates amplitude and velocity in the nls case ) is not redeemed , another property is obtained .",
    "we are now able to control the amplitude of one of the components through eq .",
    "( [ amps ] ) . however , this is again a fundamental difference with the nls system . indeed , in the nls equations it is straightforward to obtain a variety of different cases and soliton types ( bright and/or dark ) . here",
    ", only the focusing case can produce bright solitons while we where not able to find dark solitons in this manner @xcite .",
    "they may , however , be obtained , in the small amplitude limit , using the methods of ref .",
    "one final comment is that this procedure may also be used for more than two equations relating the relative amplitudes through an equation of the form of eq .",
    "( [ amps ] ) .",
    "the role of the nonlocal term @xmath9 is profound here as well . in particular , when @xmath67 , as is the case for liquid crystals , it may become ( experimentally ) more difficult to obtain soliton solutions and radiation free propagation . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ amps ] ) the smaller the right hand side becomes the more difficult it becomes to obtain amplitudes for soliton propagation .",
    "in fact , when this term vanishes it results in @xmath68 , i.e. no soliton solutions exist .",
    "furthermore , eq . ( [ amps ] ) suggests that @xmath69 meaning that even with the freedom to choose one of the amplitudes that can not exceed this maximum value . with @xmath70",
    "it is further implied that solitons can only exist in the small amplitude limit , thus suggesting that for these systems the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite may be more appropriate .    to illustrate the difference we evolve a pulse which does not obey the amplitude relation eq .",
