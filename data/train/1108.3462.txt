    "early models of traffic flow ( called _ macroscope _ models ) treated vehicles in the collective manner basing on the analogy to particles in a fluid @xcite . later on , more precise ( _ mezoscope _ ) models were being created consecutively ( mostly based on gas kinetics ) @xcite .",
    "currently , a multiagent simulation mechanism provides much more efficient _ microscope _ model where each vehicle can be regarded separately allowing for highly detailed analysis including collision avoidance @xcite , traffic virtualization @xcite , interactions with pedestrians @xcite , etc .",
    "traffic flow management varies from tracing main roads average capacity across certain area ( where macroscope models give satisfactory results ) to very low - level manipulations including re - arrangement of lanes , modifying traffic lights configuration , planning bridge locations , etc . where microscope models are most suitable @xcite .",
    "the agent - based traffic flow simulator described in @xcite is the universal microscope model .",
    "the environment for agents in this model comprises of a system of city streets defined in xml files using the following entities illustrated in figure  [ figure : representation ] :    * * road *  defines the one - way part of a street , i.e. an existing path leading from one junction to another . for the sake of simplicity , roads at the frontiers of a model are considered dead - end even though they play roles of ingoing or outgoing roads . * * queue *  defines a single lane represented as a first - in - first - out list of vehicles located on this lane one after another .",
    "note that there has to be at least one queue for each road at each junction . *",
    "* trajectory *  corresponds to a trajectory of vehicles crossing the junction from a given ingoing road to a given outgoing road .",
    "each trajectory stores the information about other trajectories with possibile collisions with it . * * track *  an abstract pair _ queue - trajectory _ binding three entities , namely queue at ingoing road , queue at outgoing road and trajectory from one to another .",
    "each vehicle in the environment is an agent that is aware of its current speed and exact location within a model ( particularly , its relative position on the present road ) .",
    "what is more , a vehicle is assigned another agent who drives it in order to achive the driver s own aim which is to get from point a to point b chosing the best possible way .",
    "driver agents are equipped with a simple perception mechanism that allows them to acquire information about a vehicle driven by them ( e.g. current lane , driving speed or acceleration ) and the current state of environment in their proximity , particularly : other vehicles ( their behaviour , distance to them , etc . ) and traffic lights .    for",
    "the sake of efficiency , described model includes the following simplifications that should be taken into account : there are traffic lights at each junction , there are no roundabouts and the presence of pedestrians is ignored",
    ".    simulation process in described model is the sequence of @xmath0 iterations executed every @xmath1 miliseconds ( by default @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "each iteration includes the following operations :    1 .",
    "apply changes in the environment ( if there are any at this time period ) including the presence of colliding tracks and the state of traffic lights .",
    "2 .   refresh all agents local information about the state of environment .",
    "refresh locations of all moving vehicles according to intentions of their drivers considering current speed and acceleration of vehicles .",
    "remove agents that achived their aims and create new ones if possible .",
    "vehicle agents collect some essential information during simulation , i.e. exact trace ; number , locations and durations of stops ; average speed etc . for the sake of further analysis .",
    "figure  [ figure : wroclaw ] depicts arrangement of main streets in wroclaw , poland that can be easily modelled using described agent - based simulator .",
    "traffic lights are commonly used as an effective solution for car flow routine regulation in virtually all agglomerations .",
    "modification of traffic lights configuration is the key aspect in optimization of traffic flow for the model presented in the previous section .    in many real - world situations ,",
    "traffic lights configuration settings are based on combination of averaged theoretical data and designer s assumptions .",
    "a multiagent simulation approach can be used instead in order to provide more accurate data .",
    "a cyclic sequence of consecutive changes of lights including detailed information about duration of time when each light is on combined with dependencies amongst all traffic lights within a given area ( typically a crossroad ) is referred to as _ traffic lights programme_. the usual representation of such programme is a graphical timeline presented in figure  [ figure : programme ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]         the merit of underlying optimization process lies in realistic accuracy provided by the agent - based simulator",
    ". performance of contemporary hardware is sufficiently enough for launching simulations containing even millions of agents in place of less accurate statistical estimations that were used in previous years .",
    "thus , the values of a function that is being optimized are in fact results of agent - based simulation .      any traffic lights programme is obliged to satisfy the following constraints :    * a change of lights can not violate the sequence ( green , yellow , red , red+yellow ) repeated continuously . *",
    "duration of green light must be greater or equal to a given minimal time length whereas durations of transient lights ( i.e. yellow and red+yellow ) are constant and can not undergo any optimization . *",
    "no collision possibilities are allowed , i.e. red light must be lit on at one pair of traffic lights until green light turns to yellow on another pair and remains yellow for a given time period ; similar condition must be satisfied during a change from green to red light .",
    "the aim is to optimize a traffic lights programme by maximizing a car flow subject to constraints described above .",
    "typical optimization criteria in such case would be : maximizing the number of agents that achived their aims during simulation , minimizing the average time of a ride , maximizing average speed of vehicles , etc . since most of the criteria correspond to each other an aggregation of at least two of them",
    "provides a fair evaluation function .",

    "let @xmath7 be the minimal and @xmath8 be the maximal feasible time length of green light duration .",
    "note that @xmath9 is determined by the time length of green light duration for @xmath10 tracks colliding with current track and some constant value reserved for transient lights .    as a result",

    "population - based incremental learning ( pbil ) @xcite can be used as an evolutionary optimization tool for the stated problem thanks to its simplicity and promising results in a broad range of applications .",
    "it is also worth noticing that even more complex evolutionary algorithms could be applied instead without a significant decrease of performance due to considerably time consuming evaluation process that is suggested in this paper .",
    "algorithm  [ algorithm : pbil ] presents the pseudocode of pbil .",
    "it is so called estimation of distribution algorithm ( eda ) @xcite based on the idea of optimizing a probability model for solution rather than implicit set of solutions .",
    "later on , individuals are randomly generated according to obtained probability distribution .",
    "the requirement for collision avoidance is not satisfied by the traffic lights programme definition itself , hence the presence of infeasible individuals in population might be expected .",
    "figure  [ figure : conflicts ] presents a simple conflicts resolving method for this case .",
    "if a collision possibility occurres between a pair of trajectories then corresponding traffic lights programme can be modified in order to ensure arbitrary set @xmath27 distance between green light durations . if any of modified green light durations becomes shorter than",
    "@xmath7 then it is automaticaly expanded to @xmath7 in the only possible way . finally ,",
    "if a conflict still occurres , a new random individual is selected .",

    "even though the results are partial at the moment and more detailed studies are still necessary , a preliminary research gives an expectation for promising results .",
    "an improvement of agent - based traffic flow model could be a next step .",
    "also a modification of evolutionary mechanism may improve the performance of optimization process . replacing pbil with bayesian optimization algorithm ( boa ) @xcite",
    "could ensure obtaining much more detailed model .",
    "unlike other evolutionary algorithms , boa not only searches for optimal solution but also gives some information about its structure .",
    "lots of dependencies ( e.g. among traffic lanes and even adjacent junctions ) could be modelled in terms of bayesian networks that are utilized in boa .",
    "what is more , such dependency model could include the fact that more effort should be put to traffic flow management inside city centers than suburbs because of greater amount of junctions , narrow and/or one - way street , etc .",
    "as it is clearly seen , the effectiveness of agent - based approach applied for traffic flow managements provides a broad range of ideas .",
