    "photodissociation regions ( pdrs ; @xcite ) are regions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) where far - ultraviolet ( fuv ; 6 ev@xmath013.6 ev ) photons dominate the structure , chemistry and thermal balance of gas @xcite .",
    "all neutral atomic hydrogen gas and a large fraction of the molecular gas in galaxies are in pdrs .",
    "pdrs are the origin of most of the non - stellar infrared emission from galaxies , including far - infrared ( fir ) continuum from dust grains , near and mid infrared ( ir ) emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) , as well as fine structure ir emission such as [ o i ] 63  and 146 , [ c i ] 370  and 609 , [ si ii ] 35  and [ c ii ] 158 .",
    "h ii  regions adjacent to pdrs are known to contribute to line emission and fir continuum that are also found in the surrounding pdrs .",
    "@xcite found that the ionized medium contributes to [ c ii ] 158  line luminosity .",
    "[ o i ] 63  and 146 , [ si ii ] 35  and [ fe ii ] 26  line emission also exist in h ii  regions @xcite .",
    "dust grains in h ii  regions absorb ionizing photons and reemit in fir continuum @xcite .",
    "thus , when we observe the h ii  region and pdr in one telescope beam , the fir and line emission generally comes from both regions .",
    "there are two methods to derive properties and contributions of h ii  regions and pdrs separately .",
    "both methods treat radiation processes of these two regions with distinctive differences .",
    "the first method is to use the [ n ii ] 122 /[c ii ] 158  ratio @xcite and [ n ii ] 205 /[c ii ] 158  ratio @xcite in ionized medium .",
    "since nitrogen has a first ionization potential ( 14.5 ev ) higher than that of hydrogen , [ n ii ] is found only in h ii  regions . using the [ n ii]/[c ii ] ratio",
    ", one can derive the emission of [ c  ii ] 158  that arises from h ii  regions .",
    "this method is only useful for deriving [ c ii ] 158  line emission .",
    "the second method is to calculate a separate model for each region . @xcite",
    "estimated the [ c ii ] 158  emission of h ii  regions from models of @xcite and the [ c ii ] 158  emission of pdrs from models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a similar approach is taken to estimate the contributions for [ si ii ] 35  line emission in m82 @xcite . @xcite",
    "combined starburst h ii  region models and pdr models of @xcite to derive the h ii  region and pdr properties of m82 .",
    "@xcite computed a separate model for each region .",
    "they merged the h ii  region model and pdr model by equaling the thermal pressure at the interface .",
    "the edge of the h ii  region is defined at the point where h is 50% neutral .",
    "this kind of separated calculation must take great care to assure that the transmitted continuum emerging from the h ii  region is consistent with the initial conditions for the pdr @xcite .",
    "using a procedure different from the above , @xcite self - consistently calculated the thermal and chemical structure of an h  ii  region and a surrounding pdr that are in pressure equilibrium ( henceforth the a05 model ) . in this method , they viewed the h  ii  region and pdr as a single region driven by uv radiation from stars .",
    "this treatment has been tested in various environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the a05 model produces diagnostics without needing to assume how much of the emission is from h  ii  regions or from pdrs .",
    "the advantage of the a05 model is to shield the complexity of the boundaries between h  ii  regions and pdrs , and provide observables based on parameterized stellar radiation , gas density , composition , and geometry .    in the a05 model ,",
    "parameterized uv flux of stars is the source of ionization and photodissociation of the ism , creating h ii  regions and surrounding pdrs .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of stellar atmospheres influences the ionization structures of h ii  regions and pdrs .",
    "@xcite computed models of h ii  regions using a variety of recent state - of - the - art stellar atmospheres models .",
    "they compared model predictions to catalogs of iso observations of galactic h ii  regions , and confirmed the finding of earlier investigation showing that costar @xcite atmospheres adopted by @xcite over - predict somewhat the ionizing flux at high energies .",
    "they also concluded that wmbasic @xcite atmospheres show a reasonable agreement with the observations .    in this paper , we adopt wmbasic stellar atmospheres , repeat the calculations presented in @xcite , using the same dynamical range for ionization parameter , density , equation of state , and abundances , and extend wavelength coverage to herschel fir bands up to 500 .",
    "then we apply our results to m82 and ngc  253 . at the same time",
    ", we explore the effect of varying stellar atmospheres in the a05 model , and compare our work with @xcite .",
    "we perform calculations for costar and wmbasic atmospheres at effective temperature @xmath1 k and at @xmath2  k. the model calculations are presented in section 3 , and the results are shown in section 4 . in section 5 , we compare model predictions to observational data in literature .",
    "we summarize in section 6 .",
    "the calculation details are the same as @xcite .",
    "the cloudy code last described by @xcite is used in calculation .",
    "we also define the end of the h ii  region in the same way as abel et al .",
    "the major differences between the @xcite calculations and the ones presented here are that we use the wmbasic stellar radiation field , and the calculations are stopped at a@xmath3 instead of 100 .    in order to explore the effect of different stellar atmospheres ,",
    "we compute models for wmbasic and costar atmospheres with incident continuum as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the costar radiation field produces more hydrogen ionizing flux than wmbasic .    in the model , the h ii  region and the pdr",
    "are placed between the ionizing source and the observers .",
    "thus , we observe the transmitted continuum and outward emission from the emitting cloud .",
    "we define that the pdr extends to a visual extinction a@xmath3 . at that depth , hydrogen is molecular and carbon is incorporated into co. figure [ fig2 ] shows that the integrated intensity of pdr lines is stable at a@xmath3 .",
    "in this section we present the calculation results in a series of contour plots for all the @xmath4 , @xmath5(h ) and stellar atmospheres . diagnostic diagrams similar to ones in @xcite",
    "are not presented here , since they are insensitive to the choice of steller continuum .",
    "we show the differences between costar and wmbasic atmospheres for the a05 model in section 4.1 . intensity ratios of fir emission for the 70 , 110 , 160 , 250 , 350 and 500  are first presented in section 4.2 .",
    "the strength of ionizing radiation field can be constrained by the intensity ratio of emission lines from sequential stages of ionization of a single element . [",

    "wmbasic atmospheres need a higher stellar temperature than costar atmospheres to produce the same ratios .",
    "the results that these h ii  region lines are sensitive to the ionizing flux distribution was also shown in @xcite .",

    "density diagnostics , [ o iii ] 52 /[o iii ] 88  ratio and [ s iii ] 18.7 /[s iii ] 33.5  ratio , are not sensitive to stellar atmospheres .",

    "interstellar dust in galaxies absorbs energy from starlight and re - radiates at ir and fir wave range .",

    "abel et al . ( 2009 ) showed the 60 /100  ratio , and the fraction of total fir emitted by dust at the h ii  ionization front . here",
    "we present the first calculations of the fir continuum ratios for the herschel bands ( figure [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ) .",

    "the contribution to fir continuum emission from h ii  regions is the same for either stellar atmospheres and therefore we only show the results for the wmbasic model in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "at relatively low density , the contributions from h ii  regions for 350 and 500  emission depend strongly on @xmath4 rather than on density , and h ii  region contributes more at higher @xmath4 . at the upper - right corner of contour plots for 350 and 500 where the density and @xmath4 are high , contributions depend both on @xmath4 and density . for 160 and 250  emission ,",
    "the contributions from h ii  regions depend strongly on @xmath4 rather than on density . for 70 and 110  emission , the contributions from h ii  regions depend both on @xmath4 and density .",

    "the h ii  region contributes more at higher @xmath4 because a larger fraction of the uv and ionizing photons are absorbed by dust in the h ii  region .",
