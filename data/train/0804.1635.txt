    "the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite ( fqhe ) is understood as a consequence of the formation of bound states of electrons and quantized vortices , known as composite fermions@xcite .",
    "in particular , the fqhe at fractions belonging to the sequences @xmath1 is a manifestation of the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) of composite fermions at the composite - fermion filling @xmath2 . in recent years",
    ", the fqhe at fractions not belonging to the these sequences has attracted interest , because it can not be explained in terms of a model of _ non_interacting composite fermions , which only exhibit iqhe . in many instances",
    ", these new fractions can be shown to arise from the weak residual interactions between composite fermions .",
    "for example , the fqhe at @xmath3 is understood as a p - wave pfaffian - paired state of composite fermion@xcite , and the fqhe at 4/11 as a _",
    "fractional _ qhe of composite fermions@xcite .",
    "recent experiments in very high mobility samples have found signatures @xcite for fqhe at @xmath0 , albeit with a tiny gap of a few mk .",
    "although the evidence is not yet conclusive , the possibility of this fqhe is particularly exciting both because it is an even denominator fraction and because this fraction occurs in the second landau level , where fqhe is not as extensive as in the lowest landau level . that has motivated us to examine various theoretical possibilities at this filling factor proceeding with the assumption that the second landau level 3/8 state can be modeled as composite fermions at filling 3/2 . within this model , we rule out several simple variational states , but find an instability of the composite fermion fermi sea into a gapped state ; while the true nature of this fqhe state is not fully understood at present , our studies indicate that it is distinct from the usual pfaffian state .",
    "we demonstrate the robustness of this state against finite thickness .",
    "the strongly interacting system of electrons confined to a landau level is described in terms of exotic emergent particles called composite fermions , which are bound states of an electron and an even number ( @xmath4 ) of vortices of the many - body wave function .",
    "the most dramatic consequence of the composite fermion ( cf ) formation is that the berry phase due to the attached vortices effectively cancels part of the external magnetic field , producing dynamics governed by a reduced field @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the cf density and @xmath7 is the flux quantum .",
    "composite fermions form landau - like levels , called @xmath8 levels , with their filling factor related to the electronic filling factor through the expression @xmath9 .",
    "the cf formation correctly accounts for most of the correlation effects , and a model of weakly interacting composite fermions securely explains the prominent experimental observations , including the fqhe @xmath10 as the iqhe of composite fermions@xcite and the compressible liquid at @xmath11 as the fermi sea of composite fermions@xcite .",
    "more subtle structures can emerge due to the weak residual interactions between composite fermions@xcite .    treating the lowest filled landau level as inert",
    ", the problem of our interest is that of interacting electrons in the second ll at @xmath12 .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space here is too large to obtain meaningful results from exact diagonalization .",
    "we proceed instead by modeling @xmath12 as a state of composite fermions at filling factor @xmath13 . assuming that composite fermions are fully spin polarized , the state contains a fully occupied lowest @xmath8 level , and a half filled second @xmath8 level .",
    "we assume that the lowest @xmath8 level is inert and work with only the composite fermions of the half filled second @xmath8 level in the rest of the paper , denoting their number by @xmath14 .",
    "several states of composite fermions have been considered at a half filled landau level : fermi sea , paired pfaffian state , stripes , and bubble crystals . when considering the first two states at half - filled _ second _ @xmath8 level , the @xmath15cfs in the second @xmath8 level capture two additional vortices to transform into @xmath16cfs , thereby producing very complex mixed structures .",
    "( the symbol @xmath17cf refers to composite fermions carrying @xmath4 vortices . ) which , if any , of these states is stabilized in nature depends on the residual interaction between composite fermions in their second @xmath8 level , which itself is a remnant of the coulomb interaction between electrons occupying the second landau level .",
    "it is interesting to note that when composite fermions in the second @xmath8-level capture an additional pair of vortices , as is the case for the cf - fermi sea or the pfaffian state , _ three _ species of fermions coexist in the system : electrons in the lowest ll , @xmath15cfs in the lowest @xmath8-level of the second ll , and and @xmath16cfs in the second @xmath8-level ; only the last will be explicitly considered in our calculations .",
    "much or our effort will be toward obtaining the effective interaction between them by integrating out the remaining fermions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ intercf ] an effective inter - cf interaction is derived for composite fermions in the second @xmath8 level of the second landau level ; both pseudopotential and real - space representations are obtained . using this interaction several variational states",
    "are compared energetically in sec .",
    "[ varist ] .",
    "exact diagonalization results in sec .  [ exact ] confirm the relative advantage of the cf fermi sea state .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ cfdiag ] , the residual interaction between composite fermions is included perturbatively to explore any further instability of the cf fermi sea state .",
    "[ concl ] summarizes the principal conclusions of our study .",
    "the determination of the inter - cf interaction proceeds along several steps .",
    "first of all , following standard practice , we represent the second ll coulomb interaction ( including finite thickness effects ) as an effective interaction in the lowest ll ( with zero thickness ) , for which we use the form@xcite @xmath18 where the constants @xmath19 are evaluated by matching the first few pseudopotentials for the two problems .",
    "this form is motivated by the following observations : ( i ) the fourier transform of the exact effective interaction for @xmath20 is@xcite @xmath21 .",
    "its inverse fourier transform @xmath22 , however , is ill - behaved in that it yields divergent pseudopotentials for relative angular momenta @xmath23 .",
    "( ii ) regularizing the interaction as in eq .",
    "( [ second ] ) removes the short distance divergences without significantly altering the long - distance behavior .",
    "( iii ) adding short - range gaussian terms and fitting the first few pseudopotentials takes care of the short range part of the interaction without affecting the long - distance behavior .",
    "the constants @xmath24 are arbitrary ; we choose @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 to maximize the efficiency of our calculation .",
    "the interaction in eq .",
    "( [ second ] ) reproduces all second ll pseudopotentials almost exactly .",
    "the transverse thickness @xmath28 is modeled through a square quantum well potential with the electronic wave function given by @xmath29 in the transverse dimension .",
    "table [ coeff ] gives @xmath19 for various values of transverse thickness @xmath28 , as well as the greatest relative error in pseudopotentials due to the approximations made in the form of eq .",
    "( [ second ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "while the noninteracting cf fermi sea is compressible , the possibility that the residual inter - cf interaction may give rise to incompressibility can not be _ a priori _ excluded .",
    "an investigation of this physics requires larger systems than can be addressed in exact diagonalization .",
    "we have studied this problem by a perturbative process called cf diagonalization@xcite .",
    "( notice that we form @xmath16cfs out of @xmath15cfs , and our starting point is a residual inter-@xmath15cf interaction @xmath30 . )",
    "the wave functions for noninteracting composite fermions , for ground as well as excited states , can be constructed by analogy with the system of noninteracting electrons at an effective filling@xcite .",
    "these are given by @xmath31 ( here , @xmath32 is the wave function for the ground or excited state at @xmath33 ) , and form bands separated by an effective cf cyclotron energy . at the @xmath34-th order cf diagonalization , we diagonalize the residual inter - cf interaction in the truncated space of correlated wave functions of the lowest @xmath35 bands , using the metropolis monte carlo method@xcite .",
    "it is necessary to go to at least second order to allow hybridization of the uniform ( with orbital angular momentum @xmath36 ) state with  excited \" bands . at the second order",
    ", the ground state has @xmath36 , with a very small gap which depends only weakly on the layer thickness , as shown in fig .",
    "the enhancement of the gap from @xmath37 to @xmath38 suggests possible establishment of incompressibility due to the residual interaction between composite fermions . while our data in the @xmath39 range , unfortunately , do not allow for an extrapolation of the gap to the thermodynamical limit ,",
    "it is clear that the gap is extremely small .",
    "( color online ) the collective mode gap at @xmath0 from second - order cf diagonalization for @xmath40 particles .",
    "the bars indicate the statistical uncertainty arising from monte carlo sampling . ]",
    "in conclusion , modeling the system at @xmath0 as filling factor @xmath41 of fully spin polarized composite fermions in the second electronic landau level , we have considered many possible structures by several methods .",
    "our study suggests the possibility of a very delicate fqhe here due to residual interactions between composite fermions , but with a state distinct from the pfaffian state . at the end , we note that even though our cf diagonalization approach gives the low energy spectrum , it does not provide a simple wave function for the ground state , which has often been very useful in achieving a physical understanding of the physics of a fqhe state .",
