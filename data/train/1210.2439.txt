    "deuteron - gold collisions at rhic provide a means to explore nuclear effects on the initial - state parton densities in the nucleus , which is vitally important to understanding the baseline production for quark - gluon plasma studies in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "rhic experiments have shown that single inclusive hadron yields in the forward ( deuteron ) rapidity direction for @xmath0 gev @xmath1aucollisions are suppressed relative to @xmath2+@xmath2collisions  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for the suppression has not been firmly established .",
    "many effects have been proposed for this suppression , such as gluon saturation  @xcite , initial state energy loss  @xcite , parton recombination  @xcite , multi - parton interactions  @xcite , and leading and higher - twist shadowing  @xcite .",
    "one set of measurements that might help to distinguish between the competing models is forward azimuthally correlated di - hadron correlation functions , which directly probe di - jet production through their 2@xmath32 back - to - back peak at @xmath4 .",
    "this technique has been used extensively at rhic and is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the di - hadron results presented here were obtained from @xmath2+@xmath2and @xmath1auruns in 2008 with the phenix detector and include a new electromagnetic calorimeter , the muon piston calorimeter ( mpc ) , with an acceptance of @xmath5 in pseudorapidity and @xmath6 .",
    "di - hadron measurements can probe more precise ranges of parton @xmath7 in a gold nucleus than do single hadron probes ( e.g. , ) . at forward rapidities",
    ", a single hadron probe will cover a very broad range of x , @xmath8 , thus mixing together the shadowing , anti - shadowing , and even emc effects  @xcite .",
    "azimuthally correlated di - hadron measurements also enhance the di - jet fraction in the event selection , since one selects only the back - to - back hadrons .    by performing several correlation measurements with particles at different and rapidities ,",
    "one can systematically scan different @xmath7 ranges with an observable that is enhanced for the leading - order perturbative qcd component . probing",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of the effect is an important test since most models predict that any effects should be stronger at smaller @xmath7 .",
    "particles at higher pseudorapidities are produced from smaller @xmath7 , so measuring hadrons from more forward rapidities should probe smaller x.",
    "for this analysis , back - to - back -or hadron - pairs are measured with one particle at mid - rapidity , and the other at forward rapidity .",
    "back - to - back cluster - pairs are also measured where both are in the forward rapidity region .",
    "the clusters are reconstructed from the energy deposit of photons in the mpc , and are estimated to be at least 80% dominated by s , with the remainder coming from single photons from decays of @xmath9 s and from direct photons .",
    "further details of the analysis are available in  @xcite .",
    "l0.65     from the pairs we extract the relative yield , , of correlated back - to - back hadrons in @xmath1aucollisions compared to @xmath2+@xmath2collisions scaled with the average number of binary nucleon collisions @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and is explained in detail in @xcite . is simply the analog of the usual nuclear modification factor but for hadron pairs .",
    "the @xmath12 are the @xmath2+@xmath2or @xmath1auinelastic cross - sections , while @xmath13 are the cross - sections for di - hadron pair production , and is used as a proxy for di - jets in phenix .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : jda_eps09 ] , we have plotted the values of versus @xmath14for four different @xmath1aucentrality selections . @xmath14is defined as @xmath15 and can be directly measured experimentally .",
    "@xmath14should be correlated with the bjorken x that is probed in the nucleus , assuming that a normal leading order ( lo ) perturbative qcd framework applies for this data . in the case of 2@xmath32 lo processes ,",
    "the variable @xmath14 is lower than @xmath16 by the mean fragmentation fraction , @xmath17 , of the struck parton in the au nucleus . from the plot",
    ", one can see that decreases with increasing centrality , or equivalently with increasing nuclear thickness .",
    "the suppression also increases as one goes to lower @xmath14 in the nucleus probed by the deuteron .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : jda_centdep ] , the values for three different @xmath14are plotted versus , the mean number of binary collisions , in the four centrality classes depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : jda_eps09 ] .",
    "one can clearly see from this plot a systematic decrease of with greater , as well as with decreasing x. the decrease is approximately linear .",
    "in a leading order pqcd picture , the variable is @xmath18 for partons a+b going to outgoing jets c+d , which then fragment to hadrons with longitudinal fractions @xmath19 , @xmath20 . in the above convolutions over the parton distribution functions ( @xmath21 ) , the parton - parton cross - section @xmath22 , and fragmentation functions @xmath23 ,",
    "most of the terms are expected to be roughly similar between p+p and d+au except for the nuclear gluon parton distribution ( pdf ) .",
    "l0.5        naively , might be largely dominated by the modification to the nuclear gluon pdf , since most of the events with di - hadrons at forward rapidities consist of a high - x parton from the deuteron and a low - x gluon from the gold nucleus . assuming this to be true , one can then associate with the relative modification of the nuclear gluon distribution , , i.e. , @xmath24 one can then interpret fig . [",
    "fig : jda_centdep ] as a systematic decrease in the gluon distribution when one goes to the thicker parts of the nucleus , perhaps due to recombination of the gluons , and that the recombination creates a proportional decrease in the number of gluons with increasing number of nucleons along a line in the nucleus .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluonoverlap ] . this decrease is stronger at lower x , which one might expect since the transverse size of the gluons are larger for lower x.",
    "if nature is kind and this data can be interpreted in terms of a simple pqcd picture , then this data may provide valuable information on how gluons recombine in the nucleus as a function of the thickness of the nucleus and bjorken x of the gluon .",
    "furthermore , it may be possible to extract , which is extremely important for understanding the quark gluon plasma since it forms the main ingredient for production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , even in a simple pqcd picture there have been proposed new effects in @xmath1aucollisions , such as initial state energy loss  @xcite , multi - parton interactions  @xcite , which may complicate the interpretation of this data .",
    "further theoretical studies are needed before a robust extraction of is credibly achieved .",
