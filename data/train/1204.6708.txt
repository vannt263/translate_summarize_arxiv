    "<S> we calculate the time - like pion - photon transition form factor and the pion electromagnetic form factor up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of the strong coupling constant in the leading - twist @xmath0 factorization formalism . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the nlo corrections to the magnitude ( phase ) are lower than @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) for the former , and lower than @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) for the latter at large invariant mass squared @xmath5 gev@xmath6 of the virtual photons . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the strong phases with @xmath7 is obtained , consistent with the tendency indicated by experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is attributed to the inclusion of parton transverse momenta @xmath0 , implying that the @xmath0 factorization is an appropriate framework for analyzing complex time - like form factors . </S>",
    "<S> potential extensions of our formalism to two - body and three - body hadronic @xmath8 meson decays are pointed out . </S>"
