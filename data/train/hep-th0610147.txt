    "the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence has revealed deep relation between string theory and gauge theory , in particular the correspondence between iib strings on @xmath3 and @xmath4 super yang - mills theory ( sym ) at the t hooft s large n limit@xcite .",
    "while the correspondence was mostly tested for those bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) states where partial supersymmetry protects it against quantum correction@xcite , semiclassical analysis on the near - bps sector is also considered in ref.@xcite ; the integrability of this berenstein - madalcena - nastase ( bmn ) limit allows for quantitative tests of correspondence beyond bps states , where the energy of classical string solutions is compared to the anomalous dimension of sym operators with large _ r_-charge . on the other hand , intimate relation between sym dynamics and integrable spin chain",
    "was realized in ref.@xcite , because the planar limit of the dilatation operator was identified with the hamiltonian of integrable spin chains .",
    "the string / spin chain correspondence was pushed further in ref.@xcite , where a classical string spinning on @xmath5 were identified with semiclassical coherent states in the @xmath1 spin chain system .",
    "later this identification was explored in the full @xmath6 sector@xcite and @xmath2 sector@xcite .",
    "a few examples of generalization were discussed in the past : the fast spinning string in the marginally @xmath7-deformed @xmath8@xcite corresponds to an anisotropic xxz spin chain@xcite .",
    "the melvin s magnetic - deformed background was also studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we are interested in another integrable system , @xmath9 background@xcite . as discussed in ref.@xcite , asymmetric marginal deformations of @xmath10 and @xmath11 wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) models",
    "create new families of exact string vacua .",
    "the corresponding geometry is a deformed @xmath12 or @xmath13 which includes , in particular , geometric coset @xmath14 or @xmath15 . in general , the effect of deformation is to turn on an electromagnetic field along some cartan direction inside @xmath16 , which in turn induces a gravitational back - reaction on the metric and the three - form antisymmetric tensor .",
    "the plan of this report is as follows .",
    "we derive spin chain models in the fast spinning limit from the deformed @xmath17 in section ii , and deformed @xmath18 in section iii .",
    "they correspond to the deformed configuration space of spin vector , a squashed two - sphere and hyperboloid , respectively . in section iv , we take the limit of small deformation and find the system can be exactly derived from a class of general landau - lifshitz equation with a nontrivial anisotropic matrix . in section",
    "v , we have a discussion and comments .",
    "[ fig_1 ]     the @xmath1 manifold is a three - sphere of unit radius .",
    "the @xmath17 wzw model then corresponds to a three - sphere of radius @xmath19 at classical level . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors discussed asymmetric marginal deformation in the background of three - sphere which breaks the bosonic affine algebra @xmath20 into @xmath21 .",
    "the deformed metric is given by @xmath22\\ ] ] we request @xmath23 to avoid non - unitary gauge field ( @xmath24 ) and closed time - like geodesics ( @xmath25 ) . for trivial @xmath26 and at level @xmath27 ,",
    "one recovers the unit round @xmath12 as hopf fibration . for maximal @xmath28 , the @xmath29 fiber degenerates and",
    "we are left with @xmath14 .",
    "now we consider a spinning string by sending @xmath30 in eq.([metric_deform ] ) , with gauge choice @xmath31 , the polyakov action reads , @xmath32 where the dot and prime are derivative with respect to worldsheet time and space coordinates .",
    "vanishing of diagonal components of the stress - energy tensor puts on a virasora constraint : @xmath33 now we take fast spinning limit @xmath34 but keep @xmath35 finite for @xmath36 . at this limit",
    ", the contribution of kinetic term , i.e. @xmath37 , is ignorable thus can be dropped . in the other words ,",
    "the string is _ frozen _ and energy is contributed mostly from curving the string .",
    "the the relevant part of eq.([action ] ) becomes @xmath38 where the virasora constraint has been applied to eliminate @xmath39 .",
    "two comments are in order : at first , we notice that there is no explicit time derivative in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , one may find a mapping @xmath40 from string worldsheet coordinate @xmath41 to the deformed two - sphere .",
    "the periodicity of closed string ensures this @xmath42 a closed trajectory on the sphere surface . to see this explicitly",
    ", one may introduce the spin vector pointing to an arbitrary point on the surface , @xmath43 such that the following constraint is satisfied @xmath44 in generic , there may not be an analytic solution for @xmath45 but it can be solved numerically .",
    "it is not surprising that the norm @xmath46 is not a constant as in @xcite but a function of @xmath7 and @xmath47 due to the deformation .",
    "however , the constraint ( [ constraint_1 ] ) implies @xmath48 is an uniform map .",
    "this reflects the very fact that string has no infrastructure for stretching .",
    "figure 1 shows that the configuration space of the spin vector is deformed from a unit two - sphere .",
    "second , the conjugate variables @xmath49 s are angular momenta associated with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . those terms can be further removed by the other virasora constraint due to tracelessness of stress - energy tensor .",
    "however , to keep them in the above action is useful in comparison with spin chain model .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath52 gives us information of length of spin chain , @xmath53 where the total length of chain for vanishing @xmath47 is defined as @xmath54 the term @xmath55 is called the wess - zumino term and it is related to the surface area bounded by @xmath48 in the undeformed case . without knowing the explicit form of @xmath56 , one can still write the spin vector with small @xmath47 expansion , @xmath57 the hamiltonian from ( [ action_1 ] ) becomes @xmath58 where the derivative of @xmath7 and @xmath51 is with respective to @xmath59 .",
    "up to a rescale of coordinates , it is easy to see that the above agrees with ref.@xcite for vanishing @xmath47 . the first term in eq.([hamilton ] )",
    "shows a quadrupole type interaction @xmath60 here we have claimed that the deformation of @xmath17 manifold can be described by an external magnetic field @xmath61 with the quadrupole type interaction . at last , we would like to comment on the ns - ns b - field which has been ignored before .",
    "the deformed _ b_-field can be obtained locally@xcite with @xmath62}=\\frac{k}{4}(1 - 2h^2)\\cos{\\beta}d\\alpha\\wedge d\\gamma,\\ ] ] which couples to string worldsheet in the way @xmath63 since we have taken the limit where @xmath64 , it is obvious @xmath65 becomes irrelevant in this limit and action ( [ action_1 ] ) is still valid .",
    "[ fig_2 ]     in this section , we consider the hyperbolic deformation of @xmath13 , or correspondingly @xmath18 wzw model@xcite .",
    "the isometry after deformation reduces to @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting metric reads , @xmath67,\\ ] ] where the string also sits at fixed @xmath50 and @xmath7 inside @xmath12 .",
    "now we consider fast spinning string , say , let @xmath68 , and at the same time rescale @xmath69 . with gauge choice @xmath70 and taking the limit @xmath71 but keeping @xmath72 finite , one reaches @xmath73,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the term associated with @xmath74 gives us the same angular momentum as the undeformed one .",
    "one may introduce the spin vector moving over a deformed hyperboloid with signature @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 such that @xmath77 is satisfied .",
    "we again do not know the analytic form for @xmath78 but it can be solved numerically .",
    "figure 2 shows that the configuration space of the spin vector is deformed from a hyperboloid . for small @xmath47 expansion",
    ", we obtain @xmath79h^2+{\\cal o}(h^4).\\ ] ] one can also read the hamiltonian from eq.([action_2 ] ) , @xmath80 where the first term can be rewritten as @xmath81",
    "in the previous discussion , we have absorbed the infinite @xmath83 by redefinition of @xmath41 on the string worldsheet such that the hamiltonian density appears finite .",
    "string sees the deformation via both interaction term @xmath84 and @xmath85 in front of @xmath86 or @xmath87 . in order to go around the complication due to deformation",
    ", one may take a new double scaling limit where both @xmath82 and @xmath88 limits are taken , but keep @xmath89 and @xmath35 finite . in this new limit ,",
    "one is able to keep nontrivial interaction term but recover the round sphere as in ref.@xcite due to @xmath90(or hyperboloid as @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is convenient to rescale @xmath92 and @xmath93 and we will only focus on the deformed @xmath17 in the following discussion .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath7 and @xmath51 after rescaling are given by @xmath94 it has been long established that the classical heisenberg spin chain is completely integrable and its equation of motion is a particular case of a more general landau - lifshitz equation@xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 @xmath97 is the unit matrix for the isotropic case@xcite , but expected to be nontrivial for the anisotropic one . indeed , a straight calculation shows that ( [ eom ] ) can be derived from ( [ ll ] ) , provided ( [ spin_vec ] ) and the anisotropic matrix @xmath98 $ ] where @xmath99 this general landau - lifshitz equation can be seen as continuous limit of the inhomogeneous heisenberg spin chain model @xmath100 where the anisotropy parameters @xmath101 .",
    "integrability of ( [ ll ] ) provides the evidence that this marginally deformed @xmath17 background is integrable , at least in the double scaling limit of fast spinning and small deformation .",
    "in this report , we have investigated the fast spinning limit of classical string in the deformed background @xmath0 . in particular , we have considered the asymmetric marginally deformed @xmath17 and @xmath18 wzw model .",
    "four comments are in order . since only the component @xmath102",
    "is deviated from identity in the case of deformed @xmath17 , it is curious if there exists a more general correspondence between nontrivial @xmath103 s and other kinds of deformation . however ,",
    "if the deformed @xmath17 discussed in ref.@xcite is unique , those other deformation , if exist , must be relevant or irrelevant . in that sense",
    ", integrability makes the system still under control even outside the reach of marginal deformation .",
    "second , the @xmath82 limit implies that we may use the same coherent states as constructed in refs.@xcite to build up a discrete sigma model , whose continuous limit will recover the action of fast spinning string .",
    "thirdly , if one could start with a deformed wzw sigma model@xcite whose target space is given by ( [ metric_deform ] ) and calculate the dilatation operator , the same spinning string can be constructed whose thermodynamic limit may give rise to the general landau - lifshitz equation ( [ ll ] ) . at last , solutions to eq.([ll ] ) has been intensely studied in recent decades . in particular , it has been found that the ( multi-)soliton solutions may correspond to ( multi-)magnon - like excitation first discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we plan to come back to these issues in future publications@xcite .",
