    "we now prove :    [ 2 m ] @xcite let @xmath190 , and let @xmath191 denote the trace zero diagonal matrix with entries .",

    "we note that @xmath262 is bounded .",
    "if the the empirical measure of eigenvalues tends to a limit measure , then @xmath262 tends to its second moment .",

    "by the assumption of definition @xmath263 by lemma [ varform]-corollary [ varcor ] , the variances of the independent random variables @xmath264 are bounded .",
    "hence , as explained in the introduction ( see also @xcite ) , ( [ ep * ] ) follows from lemma [ varform]-corollary [ varcor ] and the kolmogorov strong law of large numbers , which gives @xmath265 by ( [ y ] ) , @xmath266 hence also @xmath267    if the dimensions @xmath102 grow fast enough so that @xmath268 is summable , then we obtain a stronger form from the fact that @xmath269 is finite hence the general term must tend to zero almost everywhere .",

    "we use the basis @xmath274 with @xmath275 .",

    "it is proved that lattice points of fixed norm on a sphere of radius @xmath278 become uniformly distributed as @xmath279 @xcite .",

    "it is shown that for almost all such n , the lattice points on the circle become uniformly distributed as @xmath279 .    in the case of a generic lattice @xmath286 ,",
    "the multiplicity of eigenvalues of @xmath23 on @xmath287 is two .",
    "the analogue of the eigenspaces above are spectral subspaces for @xmath25 of shriking width @xmath288 .",
    "thus , one considers the exponentials @xmath289 for @xmath290 with @xmath291 $ ] .",
    "it follows from the lattice point results of @xcite that in dimensions @xmath9 , the number of eigenvalues of an irrational flat torus in @xmath292 $ ] is of order @xmath293 .",

    "following @xcite , we define a @xmath294 quasimode of infinite order for @xmath295 with index set @xmath296 to be a family @xmath297 of approximate eigenfunctions satisfying @xmath298 it follows by the spectral theorem that for any @xmath299 , there exists at least one eigenvalue of @xmath295 in the interval @xmath300,\\ ] ] and @xmath301 here , @xmath302 denotes the spectral projection for @xmath295 corresponding to the interval @xmath303 .",
    "we denote the quasi - classical eigenvalue spectrum of @xmath304by @xmath305    since quasi - eigenvalues @xmath306 are only defined up to errors of order @xmath307 , there is a notion of ` multiple quasi - eigenvalue ' defined as follows : we say @xmath308 if @xmath309 and define the multiplicity of @xmath310 by @xmath311",
    "we then introduce slightly larger intervals @xmath312 ( if need be ) so that @xmath313 here , @xmath314 consists of equivalence classes of indices ( corresponding to equivalence classes of quasimodes ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath315 the span of the quasimodes @xmath316 .",

    "one might expect true modes ( eigenfunctions ) with eigenvalues in the intervals @xmath319 to be close to linear combinations of the quasi - modes with quasi - eigenvalues in that interval .",
    "the question raised by theorem [ maintheo ] is whether they behave like random linear combinations or not .",
    "if they do , theorem [ maintheo ] gives their quantum limits .",
    "in particular , this bears on the question whether @xmath23-eigenfunctions of compact riemannian manifolds @xmath12 with kam geodesic flow might be quantum ergodic .",
    "it seems unlikely that they are , but we are not aware of a proof that they are not . for such kam @xmath12 , a large family of quasi - modes",

    "<S> our calculations therefore go beyond what is necessary for almost sure quantum ergodicity , and pertain to the asymptotic geometry of the polytopes @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a natural condition on the this sequence of polytopes :    [ limit ] we say that the sequence @xmath55 has szeg asymptotics if , for all @xmath13 , there exists a unique weak * limit , @xmath117 as @xmath118 . here , @xmath119 is the set of probability measures on @xmath120 .    </S>",
    "<S> under this stronger assumption , lemma [ 4 ] gives moment asymptotics :    [ 1 ] let @xmath121 be a sequence of vectors with the property that the empirical measures tend to a weak limit @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath123    this proposition is closely related to the  weingarten theorem \" that the matrix elements @xmath124 are asymptotically complex normal random variables , where @xmath125 are the matrix elements of @xmath126 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps this explains why the fourth moment is a constant multiple of the square of the second moment </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to see if the pattern continues ; we plan to study @xmath18 further in @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for proving quantum ergodicity of random orthonormal bases for @xmath0 of any dimensions tending to infinity was prompted by the general question : how many diffuse states ( modes or quasi - modes ) does it take to synthesize localized modes or quasi - modes ? </S>",
    "<S> vice - versa , how many localized states does it take to synthesize diffuse states ? </S>",
    "<S> we would like to synthesize entire orthonormal bases rather than individual states and measure the dimensions of the space of states in terms of the planck constant @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider some examples .    in the case of the standard @xmath7 , the eigenspaces @xmath0 of @xmath23 are the spaces of spherical harmonics of degree @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> they have the well - known highly localized basis @xmath128 of joint eigenfunctions of @xmath23 and of rotations around the @xmath129-axis . by localized we mean that a sequence @xmath130 with @xmath131 microlocally concentrates on the invariant tori in @xmath132 where @xmath133 . here , @xmath134 where @xmath135 generates the @xmath129-axis rotations . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it is proved in @xcite that independent  </S>",
    "<S> random \" orthonormal bases of @xmath0 are quantum ergodic , i.e. are highly diffuse in @xmath132 . since @xmath136 , it is perhaps not surprising that the same eigenspace can have both highly localized and highly diffuse orthonormal bases when its dimenson is so large . </S>",
    "<S> the question is , how large must it be for such incoherently related bases to exist ?    </S>",
    "<S> a setting where the eigenvalues have high multiplicity but of a lower order of magnitude than on @xmath7 is that of flat rational tori @xmath137 such as @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> of course it has an orthonormal basis of localized eigenfunctions , @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature of such rational tori is the high multiplicity of eigenvalues of the laplacian @xmath23 of the flat metric . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known and easy to see that the multiplicity is the number of lattice points of the dual lattice @xmath140 lying on the surface of a euclidean sphere . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the distinct multiple @xmath23-eigenvalues by @xmath141 , the corresponding eigenspace by @xmath0 and the multiplicity of @xmath142 by @xmath143 . in dimensions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath144 , @xmath145 , one degree lower than the maximum possible multiplicity of a @xmath23-eigenvalue on any compact riemannian manifold , achieved on the standard @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> further , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the results of this article show that despite the relatively slow growth of @xmath102 on a flat rational torus , orthonormal bases of @xmath0 in dimensions @xmath29 are almost surely quantum ergodic . </S>",
    "<S> the statement for dimensions @xmath147 is more complicated ( see  [ torus ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting setting where the behavior of eigenfunctions is largely unknown is that of kam systems . for these </S>",
    "<S> , one may construct a ` nearly ' complete and orthonormal basis for @xmath38 by highly localized quasi - modes associated to the cantor set of invariant tori . </S>",
    "<S> it seems unlikely that the actual eigenfunctions are quantum ergodic ; but the results of this article show that if they resemble random combinations of the quasi - mode , then it is possible that they are . </S>",
    "<S> further discussion is in  [ qm ] . </S>"
