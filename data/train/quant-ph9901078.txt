    "a two - level system ( 2ls ) interacting with a quantum field  electromagnetic field ( emf ) in particular  has proven to be a very useful model for a wide range of problems from atomic - optical @xcite and condensed matter @xcite processes to quantum computation @xcite . for the latter application stringent limits in maintaining the coherence of the the 2ls ( called qubits )",
    "are required .",
    "this prompted us to revisit the theoretical structure of the 2ls model , paying special attention to its coherence properties .",
    "treatment of spontaneous emission and relaxation are standard textbook topics , whereas decoherence and dissipation , especially in the context of quantum computation , are the focus of more recent investigations @xcite .",
    "because of the familiarity of the model ( see ii.a ) and its theoretical and practical values , we do not need to emphasize the general motivation , but can go right to the point about the aim and results of this paper .",
    "the description of this system generally comprises of two parts : 1 ) spontaneous emission in the 2ls , and 2 ) decoherence due to the interaction of 2ls with the em field , treated as a bath .",
    "the first part allows little room for disagreement , as it can be obtained from elementary calculations .",
    "the second part on decoherence is more subtle .",
    "environment - induced decoherence @xcite has been studied extensively in recent years primarily based on models of quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) @xcite for the interaction of a simple harmonic oscillator ( brownian particle ) with a harmonic oscillator bath ( hob ) at a finite temperature , leading to a reasonably good understanding of its characteristic features .",
    "decoherence of a 2ls in an em field has been studied by a number of authors , notably @xcite , and their dissipative and decoherent behavior are reported to be similar to that of a qbm in a harmonic oscillator bath .",
    "the progression in three stages  quiescent , vacuum fluctuation - dominated and thermal fluctuation - dominated , separated by the cutoff frequency and the thermal de broglie frequency ( wavelength )  are indeed characteristic of the qbm results @xcite . our findings , in contrast , are in stark disagreement from that reported in the literature .",
    "we work with the standard 2ls - emf model @xcite and obtain an exact master equation for depicting non - markovian dynamics .",
    "solution of this equation for the reduced density matrix of the 2ls shows that the decoherence rate is close to the relaxation rate .",
    "this is in first appearance rather couter - intuitive , and different from all previous findings . upon careful deliberation",
    "we realize that the ` intuition ' researchers ( including us at the start ) have acquired for dissipation and decoherence are based on the qbm model which influenced the choice of model in the investigation of decoherence for a 2ls .",
    "however , we find that such a commonly invoked intuition for qbm in a hob fails to apply to that of a two - level atom ( 2la ) interacting with an electromagnetic field ( emf ) with the commonly assumed type of resonance coupling in quantum optics .",
    "+ _ decoherence in qbm",
    "_ + physically , when we say that decoherence of the system of a brownian oscillator proceeds in a very short time as it is brought in contact with an environment , a hob at some temperture , we are usually conjuring a model with bilinear @xcite ( or polynomial @xcite ) coupling of the oscillator - bath coordinates , and a ohmic or subohmic spectral function @xcite in the bath .",
    "intuitively , the bath needs to have many degrees of freedom , preferably acting independently of each other so incooperatively that the phase information in the system will be dispersed to the largest extent amongst the many bath degrees of freedom and affords little chance or takes inordinately long time to be revived or reconstituted ( recoherence @xcite ) . the opposite picture ( of very long decoherence time )",
    "is exemplified by two coupled subsystems where no coarse - graining is introduced , or for system - environment couplings which maintain some high level of coherence , or for an environment whose degrees of freedom have long correlation times like in a zero temperature , supraohmic bath .",
    "the case of a ( spin ) particle or ( plasma ) wave interacting with an averaged ( collective ) variable from the environment , such as the mean field , showing landau damping in vlasov dynamics is another example @xcite . just as in the spin echo phenomena ( e.g , chap . 3 @xcite ) , the basic physics in this case is not dissipation in the boltzmann sense , but statistical mixing @xcite .",
    "we will see that this example is of more physical relevance to our problem than the qbm .",
    "+ _ coherence in the 2ls _ + for the 2la - emf system , one clear distinction between an em field as an environment and a system of harmonic oscillators as bath is that the field ( coupled to a detector ) has an intrinsic spectral density function , not to be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "for example , it has been shown @xcite that a conformal scalar field in two dimensions coupled to a monopole detector has an ohmic character while in four dimensions it is supraohmic .",
    "barone and caldeira @xcite showed that the spectral density function for em fields with momentum coupling to an oscillator detector is supraohmic .",
    "these density functions would show very different decoherence behavior from the high temperature ohmic hob used in many discussions of decoherence , the latter case is what the general folklore is based on .",
    "but the most important distinction from qbm is that the 2la couples with the emf in the discrete number basis for the field , unlike the continuous amplitude basis in the qbm .",
    "this fact ( which is true in the rotating wave and dipole approximation ) implies that the 2ls plus emf system is a _ resonant _ one .",
    "hence even though the em field has just as many ( large number of ) modes as the hob , only a very small fraction of them in a narrow range of the resonance frequency are efficiently coupled to the atom .",
    "this is the root cause for the very different qualitative behaviour between the qbm and the 2ls as far as decoherence is concerned .",
    "one extreme case is that of a single mode field described by the jaynes - cummings model , where rabi nutation takes place and the atom - field remains largely a coherent system .",
    "( for a coherent field , the probability for the atom to be found in the excited state at time t regardless of the state of the field ) obeys a poisson distribution .",
    "this distribution in the photon number induces a spread in the rabi frequencies , and causes collapse and revival of the rabi nutation .",
    "these are distinct features of quantum coherence @xcite . ) adding all modes to the field we see spontaneous emission and the decay of the atom .",
    "the probability of an initially excited atom ( remaining in the excited state ) decays exponentially in the wigner - weisskopf form ( characteristic of markovian processes ) with relaxation time constant @xmath1 . for purely radiative decay",
    "the decay time @xmath2 of the inversion is half the decay time @xmath3 of the polarization .",
    "there is no large order of magnitude differences between dissipation and decoherence time ( which in typical qbm high temperature conditions could be as high as 40 @xcite ) .",
    "in fact it is perhaps inappropriate to talk about dissipation for a 2la - emf system because the conditions for a bath to actuate such a process is lacking .",
    "the transition from excited to ground state is closer in nature to relaxation ( in the spin echo sense ) than dissipation . in a cavity where excitation of the atom from the field ( absorption ) balances with emission , it is more appropriate to refer to the resonant state of the atom - field as a coherent system . in these senarios",
    "the distinction between qbm and 2la can not be clearer .",
    "+ _ difference between qbm and 2ls _ + so what led earlier authors to make the qualitative claim that 2ls decoheres easily ?",
    "we think the confusion arises when the picture of qbm dissipation and decoherence is grafted on the 2la - emf system indiscriminantly .",
    "if the field which acts as the environment is a phonon field ( from ion vibrations , see , e.g. , @xcite ) and if the coupling is of the non - resonant type , then there is no disagreement .",
    "decoherence should follow the qbm pattern as reported by many authors .",
    "such sources ( including atomic collisions in a cavity @xcite ) can be important for some setups .",
    "however , when one claims that the em field can decohere a 2ls ( with which it is coupled in a resonant way , as in the standard model ) that is where we disagree .",
    "quantitatively , the model for the 2ls used by most authors for the discussion of decoherence inspired by qbm type of behavior has the atom in a @xmath4 state ( the diagonal pauli matrix ) coupled to the field mode operators @xmath5 .",
    "this type of coupling term ( call it @xmath4 type for convenience ) commutes with the hamiltonian of the system , and admits a diagonalization in the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian .",
    "the field is coupled to the atom as a whole and thus is insensitive to the 2 level transition activity . in particular it does not probe the resonance or coherent properties of the two level atom , which is the most important feature , for quantum computation .",
    "by contrast the standard model for 2la - emf which we studied has a @xmath6 coupling ( call it standard coupling ) to the field modes which highlights the 2 level activity of the atom and the field .",
    "this coupling considered in the standard model is indispensible , i.e. , it _ can not _ be removed from the two - level atom as it _",
    "defines _ it and will be present in any realistic situation .",
    "what then is the origin of the qbm type of contribution to the 2ls ?",
    "if one accepts an environment other than the em field , the question comes down to the characteristics of the experimental apparatus . for well-",
    "prepared ion traps we would expect it to be rather unimportant . if the em field is the only field present , we can still ask if a qbm type of coupling term with the em field would appear , and if yes , how strong would its effect be ? this would be a useful way to accomodate the two different types of coupling terms .",
    "recall that the standard model is derived under the dipole and rotating wave approximation . in the next section",
    "we will show that the @xmath4 type of coupling appears only in the next order expansion after the dipole approximation .",
    "since these are good approximations for a large class of atomic states when the atom is nonrelativistic , the contribution from the qbm type of coupling used in @xcite should be negligible and its ensuing decoherent effect insignificant . in this sense the em field does not in leading order of approximation act like a bath in the qbm way , and coherence in a 2la - emf system",
    "is quite well preserved ( excepting other processes , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our puzzle over the result on decoherence in the 2ls reported in the literature was what prompted us to begin this study . without letting any familiar and convenient analogy influence our judgement , and without any preconceived notion , we choose to perform a first - principles calculation of the two - level atom ( 2la)-electromagnetic field ( emf ) system making as few assumptions and covering as wide a range of conditions as possible .",
    "we use the influence functional method @xcite to take into account the full backreaction of the field on the atom , while adopting grassmannian variables for the 2la and the coherent state representation for the emf .",
    "we find exact master equations for the full ( non - markovian ) dynamics in the cases of a free quantum field and a cavity field at zero temperature .    in the next section we present the model and the formalism . a detailed derivation of our model is contained in appendix a. in sec .",
    "3 we derive the master equations . in sec",
    "4 we study different mode composition of the field , including that of an atom in a cavity .",
    "we end in sec . 5 with a discussion of our findings and their implications .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers on 2latom and quantum decoherence .",
    "the subsequent papers will treat 2la- emf interaction at finite temperature , for em fields in a coherent and squeezed state , and for multipolar models ( where coupling other than the minimal is assumed ) .",
    "we will also tend to collective qubit systems and moving atoms interacting with an em field .",
    "these results will have corresponding applications in atom optics and quantum computation problems .",
    "our model for atom - field interaction is the standard one ( see appendix a for details ) @xcite . the total hamiltonian for a ( stationary ) atom interacting with a quantum electromagnetic field ( emf ) under the dipole , rotating wave ( rw ) and two - level ( 2l ) approximation is given by    = _0 s_z + _ where @xmath7 are the creation and annihilation operators for the kth normal mode with frequency @xmath8 of the electromagnetic field ( thus for the field vacuum @xmath9 = \\delta_{\\bk,\\bk'}$ ] , for all @xmath10 . ) , and @xmath11 is the frequency between the two levels .",

    "is evaluated at the position of the atom @xmath25 . since @xmath26 , @xmath27 , we will choose a mode function representation such that @xmath28 is real . to see how this",

    "this has a contribution to @xmath29 even when @xmath30 which is equal to @xmath31where @xmath32and @xmath33 is a constant given by @xmath34this generates an additional coupling term @xmath35where @xmath36this gives the lowest order @xmath4 type of coupling in a 2la -emf system .",

    "the two - level system in tunneling has been discussed in detail by leggett et al @xcite , but the derivation of a master equation by this method which can traverse the non markovian regimes has not yet been carried out .",
    "we shall perform such a calculation for a two level system , with the aid of grassmaninn variables convenient for treating fermions , and the coherent state representation in a path integral form .",

    "one might then question the validity of equation ( 2.6 ) for the path integral ; it clearly exists as a formal expression , but its evaluation with a saddle point method , that is based on the hamiltonian of equation ( 2.8 ) might be problematic .",
    "we dispell this doubt for the vacuum case with an operaytor method proof of the master equation in appendix b. it shows that at least for the vacuum case tha saddle point evaluation yields the correct result .",
    "the general cases need separate considerations . for many qubits coupled to the em field vacuum",

    "as the system evolves , both @xmath56 and @xmath42 contain grassmann and c - number parts .",
    "the mixing of even and odd parts ( note @xmath57 is odd ) comes about as the initially factorized atom state becomes `` dressed '' .    in the open system philosophy ,",
    "as we are interested in the averaged effect of the field on the atom , the atom is considered as the ` system ' while the field as the ` environment ' .",

    "but on the other hand @xmath74 itself determines the rate of nergy flow from the atom to the environment .",

    "we will try to give some analytic expressions for this function in various different cases .      to connect with known results @xcite ,",
    "let us start with the case when the field contains only a single mode with frequency @xmath98 .",
    "then @xmath99 will read @xmath100 and @xmath101 the integrand has two poles at the solutions of the equation @xmath102 given by @xmath103^{1/2}}{2}=-i\\omega _ { 1,2}\\ ] ] hence @xmath104 this result is in agreement with standard ones @xcite      now we consider the case of the vacuum electromagnetic field in free space i.e. not constrained by a cavity .",
    "the kernel will read then ( using equation ( ii.24 ) ) @xmath105 where @xmath106 note the factor of @xmath107 in ( iv.6 ) coming from the two photon polarisations and that we in view of ( ii.3 ) we have written @xmath108 .",
    "since the integral ( iv.7 ) is not convergent , we will introduce an exponential cut - off in the higher frequency modes .",
    "the presence of the cut - off is of physical significance since we do not expect high electromagnetic modes to couple with our two - level atom .",
    "hence the kernel @xmath109 will read @xmath110 the laplace transform of @xmath109 is then @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the exponential integral function analytically continued to the complex domain . at the limit @xmath113",
    "this is essentially @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the euler - macheronni constant and the logarithm is taking values in the primary branch .",
    "thus @xmath77 reads ( @xmath116 is here @xmath117 obtained by the integration by parts of the laplace transform ) @xmath118 note that the cut - off @xmath119 affects significantly @xmath120 only at large values of @xmath42 , which essentially correspond to the very short time limit , i.e the time where the two - level atom starts  getting acquainted  with the photon reservoir . at larger times ( @xmath121 )",
    "we do not expect the cut - off to contribute significantly in the evolution .",
    "this is a rather typical behaviour in quantum brownian motion models , provided that the ultraviolet cut - off of the environment is much larger than the natural frequencies of the system .    to evaluate the integral we first have to find the poles of the denominator .",
    "we can do that in a perturbation expansion .",
    "first let us absorb the divergent @xmath116 factor in a frequency renormalisation .",
    "@xmath122 so that we need find the zeros of the function @xmath123 .",
    "looking for a solution in the vicinity of @xmath124 we find @xmath125 we have a pole with a negative real part and we can verify numerically ( also physically expected ) that there is no pole with greater real part .",
    "this means when evaluating the inverse laplace transform we can ignore the contribution of the branch - cut at @xmath126 ( being on the right of the pole ) and hence after some time , where all possible other poles with absolutely larger value of their real part will have stopped contributing the solution will be @xmath127 this implies a markovian time evolution and the identification of decoherence - relaxation time with @xmath128 .",
    "this is a general feature of the presence of a continuum of modes as can be seen from the case of an atom transparent to all modes but the ones in a strip , say @xmath129 $ ] containing the resonance frequency .",
    "it is easy to verify that in this case we have again @xmath130 hence defining again @xmath131 we can find the pole at @xmath132    note that the real part of the pole comes from the presence of a minus sign in a logarithm of some real valued object .",
    "hence in the case where the atom s frequency is outside the strip of interacting modes there will be no dissipation .",
    "this feature separates us from the qbm case , characterising the atom - field system as primarily a resonant one .",
    "let us now consider the case of the atom lying within a cavity consisting of two parallel plates at distance @xmath133 .",
    "the field satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions on the surface of the plates , hence the modes in the normal direction to the plates are multiples of @xmath134 .",
    "the kernel then reads @xmath135 hence we can compute its laplace transform @xmath136 where @xmath137 is defined by @xmath138 and appears in equation ( iv.20 ) through analytical continuation in the complex plane .",
    "this integral can actually be computed at the limit of vanishing @xmath139 ( @xmath113 ) - see reference @xcite , equation 3.427.4 .",

    "the logarithm of the @xmath142-function gives a countable number of branch cuts at @xmath143 , @xmath144 positive integer , the resonance modes of the cavity .",
    "again the important pole has a negative real part .",
    "we can again compute the pole perturbatively .",
    "it lies at @xmath145 clearly the logarithm of the gamma functions is the term out of which the real part of the pole appears .",
    "since the real part of the pole is negative the branch cut is excluded from the integration contour and hence @xmath146 here @xmath142 gives a dissipation constant . .",
    "in figure 1 we give a plot of the real part of the pole ( @xmath147 ) as a function of the frequency @xmath148 .",
    "note that it has sharp maxima on the resonance points , implying persistence of coherence .    already from the approximation ( iv.23 )",
    "we observe that the difference in the renormalized frequency from the case @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) is finite .",
    "unfortunately perturbation expansion is not reliable when @xmath151 is close to the resonance frequencies ( this corresponds to negative integers arguments in the @xmath1-function where it diverges ) and for this regime we have not been able to get any analytic results . in figure 2",
    "we have plotted the dependence of @xmath152 - \\omega[\\infty ] $ ] as the frequency changes .",
    "this effect of the frequency shift for an atom within the cavity is well known , as well as its relation to the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "let us now integrate what we have found and look at the overall picture .",
    "the physics of a 2la - emf system at zero temperature is characterized by a number of time constants : + 1 ) the inverse natural frequency @xmath153 + 2 ) the inverse coupling constant @xmath154 + 3 ) the relaxation time constant @xmath155 + 4 ) the cavity size @xmath156 ( divided by c )    first consider a zero temperature field in free space , thus ignoring factors 4 ) .",
    "start with only one mode in the field in resonance with the atom , then the system undergoes rabi nutation with frequency @xmath157 , where @xmath144 is the photon number in the field . the collapse time ( assuming a large mean photon number @xmath158 ) is @xmath159 , and revival time is @xmath160 .",
    "atom excitation becomes significant in a time much greater than @xmath161 but shorter than @xmath162 .",
    "( this is the condition for a first order perturbation theory to give reasonable results . ) for a large number of modes , spontaneous emission occurs at the relaxation time scale @xmath163 which we found to be the same as the decoherence time  the time for the off diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix to decay ( sec .",
    "4 ) . when the mean number of photons in the field is large ( @xmath164 ) , they become comparable to the collapse time .",
    "this is a measure of the coherence in the atom - field system , and is controlled mainly by their coupling and the photon number in the field .",
    "we see that with the resonance condition , the nature of decoherence in 2ls is very different from the qbm situation , where phase information in the brownian particle is efficiently dispersed in the many modes in the bath coupled almost equally to the system . as we remarked in the introduction ,",
    "the identification of the phase information and energy flow from the 2ls to its environment is similar to the spin echo phenomena ( landau ` damping ' ) which is based on statistical mixing rather than dissipation .",
    "the mathematical distinction lies between considering the system coupled to the discrete number basis ( our model ) and the continuous amplitude basis ( qbm ) of the environment .",
    "the latter case essentially produces noise that drives the system in a way insensitive to its own intrinsic dynamics . while in the former case , the coupling respects the internal dynamical structure of the 2ls and allows it to keep its coherence .    to see how the distribution of modes in a field changes the picture , the cavity field calculation in sec .",
    "4 is useful . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the relaxation constant develops peaks and minima .",
    "the resonance effect is enhanced by a cavity size commensurate with the natural frequency of the 2la and dissipation weakens .",
    "narrow band resonance fluorescence as well as inhibition of spontaneous decay by frequent measurements  the quantum zeno effect ",
    "are interesting phenomena which our equations can provide finer details .",
    "non - markovian processes involve memory effects ( nonlocal in time ) . for the qbm problem , except for the case of high temperature ohmic bath which gives markovian dynamics , other types of spectral density ( supraohmic ) or at low temperatures , the dynamics of the system",
    "is non - markovian @xcite . when the reaction time of the bath is comparable to or faster than the natural time scale of the system ( @xmath165 ) , one also expects to see non - markovian behavior .",
    "by contrast , the 2la is quite different : at zero temperature there is only one timescale @xmath166 that determines both decoherence and relaxation .",
    "there is no memory effect and hence the process is markovian .",
    "we expect that in finite temperature the dynamics of the 2la will be nonmarkovian @xcite .",
    "this is because there are more ways for the atom and the field to get entangled , and the memory effects of their interaction would presumably persist .    in conclusion we find that the 2ls interacting with an em field is far more coherent than what is commonly believed , the misconception probably arising from the mistaken identification of this system with the brownian model of an oscillator interacting with a harmonic oscillator bath . +   +   + * acknowledgement * we wish to thank phillip johnson and adrian dragulescu for a close reading of our paper and making useful suggestions , and sanjiv shresta for checking the formulae and solutions to some nonlocal differential equations numerically and providing us with the figures .",
    "sanjiv shresta also first noticed a sign disrepancy in a sample calculation , which alerted us to possible ambiguities in the grassmanian variable approach for finite temperature and coherent state fields .",
    "we also thank dr juan pablo paz for pointing out a mistake in equation ( iii.17 ) of an earlier version of this paper .",
    "this work is supported in part by nsf grant phy98 - 00967 .",
    "in this appendix we give a rather detailed derivation of the hamiltonian for a nonrelativistic atom interacting with a second - quantized electromagnetic field under the dipole , rotating wave and two level approximations .",
    "this is to facilitate the comparison of our model ( ii.1 ) with @xmath6 coupling with that used by others ( ii.3 ) with @xmath4 coupling .",

    "denoting the ( time - independent , nonrelativistic ) electronic wave function eigenstate belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath183 by @xmath18 , i.e , @xmath184 , we can write the hamiltonian for the electron in the second - quantized form as h_e = _",
