    "experimental techniques are now able to probe condensed matter systems at higher and higher pressures through the use of diamond - anvil cells or dynamical shock methods  @xcite . at these newly attainable pressures ,",
    "structural and electronic phase transitions can occur , opening the door to exploration for new physical phenomena .",
    "such systems offer an exciting avenue for first principle calculations , as their predictions can not only follow but also sometimes lead results from new experimental techniques  @xcite . when applying traditional first principle calculations to such systems , care must be taken , as most basis sets take advantage of the distinction between the core regions and valence regions which is prominent at ambient conditions .",
    "however , when studying systems over a wide range of pressures , this distinction vanishes , and both regions need to be treated on an equal footing .",
    "the following section discusses some problems that can occur when applying some of the most popular basis sets to high pressure systems .    to overcome the above potential pitfalls and to allow for accurate description of both the core and valence regions while keeping the mathematical stability and systematic convergence of the plane - wave basis ,",
    "we have developed a method based on perturbation theory .",
    "this method can be used for direct all - electron calculations , dramatically reduces the size of the plane - wave basis while properly accounting for all higher momentum states , accounts accurately for the core electrons and their interaction with the valence region , and automatically generates pseudopotentials which change with the environment thereby enhancing transferability . moreover",
    ", the effect of pseudizing in the crystal can be quantified ; hence , accurate predictions for transferability can be made in _ any _ environment .",
    "finally , the method can be implemented into current state of the art minimization techniques , such as the conjugate gradient method , and is therefore computationally efficient .    as an application , we study high pressure phases of boron .",
    "boron crystallizes into many complex structures , which are governed by the regular icosahedron  @xcite .",
    "boron is semiconducting at ambient conditions , turns metallic under pressure ( @xmath0 170 gpa ) and superconducting above 160 gpa  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , mailhiot and coworkers  @xcite were the first to apply density - functional techniques to the study of the phases of boron at high pressures .",
    "to date , however , such studies  @xcite have been limited to a modest selection of phases and were based on traditional techniques which artificially separate the physics in the core and valence regions . in this work , we apply our new , unbiased technique to a wider range of phases and find a new phase , the structure , to be lower in energy at high pressure than any phase reported previously and to have important potential implications for the observed semiconductor - metallic phase transition associated with the superconductivity .",
    "we proceed as follows : section  [ sec - methods ] describes the various methods that can be used to study systems under high pressure , specifically , the pros and cons of each method .",
    "then in sections  [ sec - pert ]  and  [ sec - cg ] our method is developed .",
    "computational details are presented in section  [ sec - details ] , finally , we apply our approach to study the high pressure phases of boron in section  [ sec - boron ] .",
    "within current state of the art electronic structure calculations , various approaches can be taken , mainly differentiated by the choice in basis set .",
    "each set has its own benefits and disadvantages .",
    "some of the most common basis sets are the plane - waves  @xcite , gaussian  @xcite , linearized methods  @xcite , and wavelets  @xcite",
    ". we will now go over the various basis sets and focus on problems that may occur when each is applied to high pressure systems .",
    "the gaussian basis set expands the wave functions in terms of linear combinations of gaussians designed to represent the atomic orbitals well .",
    "such a basis set has the advantageous property of expanding the wave functions in a small number of computationally efficient basis functions .",
    "there are , however , some drawbacks .",
    "notably , such a basis set can not be improved systematically .",
    "this does not tend to be a practical problem for normal systems ; however , such a problem can manifest itself for a system studied at various volumes , as the basis set will span a different percentage of real space for systems whose volume differ appreciably . because it is unclear of how to convergence such a basis set systematically , it is unknown whether standard gaussian basis sets will perform well at high - pressures , particularly because such bases are biased toward orbitals constructed at ambient conditions .",
    "it is thus unclear if such a bias can hamper calculations at high pressures , where unknown phenomena may occur .",
    "linearized methods generally fall under one of two methods : the linear muffin tin orbital ( lmto )  @xcite method or the linearized augmented plane - wave ( lapw )  @xcite method .",
    "of these two , the lapw is more accurate and we will therefore concentrate on this approach . when studying systems under high pressure , the most notable problem that can occur with the lapw method is the treatment of the core electrons . at high pressures ,",
    "certain core electrons need to be promoted and treated as valence electrons , and care must be taken with this method when promoting such electrons .",
    "two widely used approaches to promote such electrons are the multiple window approach  @xcite and the localized orbital approach  @xcite .",
    "both of these approaches could be particularly problematic for high pressure systems , particularly for first row elements .",
    "the multiple window method is not guaranteed to give a good solution  @xcite , as different basis sets are used to expand the core and valence electrons . in the localized orbital approach ,",
    "this problem is resolved by using one energy window .",
    "however , problems may exist , as there are very large energy separations between the valence bands and the core bands , particularly for first row elements .",
    "the plane - wave approach , when used with the pure coulomb potential , has the advantageous property that convergence of the energy can be systematically improved in a stable and controllable framework .",
    "moreover , such a basis is unbiased and can therefore represent core and valence regions on an equal footing .",
    "however , such an approach has only been used for the simplest systems , such as hydrogen  @xcite and lithium  @xcite as it requires a huge number of plane - waves to properly account for the singular coulomb potential and the exclusion principle .",
    "therefore such an approach is not practical beyond the simplest systems .",
    "the pseudopotential approach had been developed to circumvent the above difficulties with plane waves bases  @xcite .",
    "however , pseudopotentials are poorly suited for studying high pressure systems because , although some key properties are known  @xcite , the transferability of pseudopotentials is not systematically understood , particularly when the pseudized regions occupy a large percentage of the available volume as they do at high densities .",
    "more fundamentally , apart from nonlinear core corrections in the exchange - correlation potential  @xcite , pseudopotentials completely ignore the core region , which have been shown to play a vital role for high pressure systems  @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful techniques , which keeps the benefits of the pseudopotential approach and can allow for core electrons and can recover details of the true wave function in the core region , is the projected augmented wave ( paw )  @xcite method .",
    "this method has been used to study lithium and sodium  @xcite under high pressure .",
    "such a method is quite elegant ; however , it must be constructed from a referenced atomic state . moreover , the construction of such a potential still requires a real space cutoff . in order to effectively study high pressure systems ,",
    "such a cutoff should be made quite small , so that the pseudized regions do not overlap .",
    "the approach then looses many of its computational benefits .",
    "the final type of basis set of which we are aware in the study of solid state systems are wavelet bases  @xcite .",
    "such bases have the attractive property of using multi - resolution analysis to provide the necessary resolution in each region of space in a systematic and mathematically stable manner and thereby efficiently handle valence and core electrons exactly .",
    "however , such a basis set has just come to the fore and has not yet been adopted by many groups .",
    "we now describe a technique which has the advantage of using a plane - wave basis without pseudopotentials .",
    "this method has the added benefit of greatly reducing the size of the plane - wave basis set by generating the important high momentum states through perturbation theory .",
    "below , we show that a properly constructed perturbation expansion can be quite accurate in this context .",
    "finally , we show that this method can easily be implemented in current conjugate gradient techniques and therefore can be used with highly optimized minimization techniques .",
    "in the next two sections the method will be derived . to gain insight into this method",
    ", it will first be derived for the simple case of directly diagonalizing the single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "then , connections will be made to previous approach  @xcite . in section  [ sec - cg ]",
    ", the procedure will be implemented into the conjugate gradient framework , so that optimized calculations can be performed .",
    "technical details will be discussed in section  [ sec - details ] . for simplicity in the formal developments below",
    ", we sample the brillouin zone at the gamma point . adding in k - point dependence is straightforward .",
    "[ sec - diag ]    standard electronic structure calculations seek for the minimum of an energy functional @xmath1 $ ] as a function of a set of basis function coefficients @xmath2 subject to an orthonormality constraint .",
    "the variational derivative of this energy functional and constraint then lead to the standard eigenvalue problem @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the single - particle hamiltonian ( fixed and not updated self - consistently for the discussion in this section ) , @xmath5 is an eigenvector and @xmath6 is the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "note that we here assume that the basis set is orthonormal as our objective here is to work with plane waves .    separating the coefficients into two groups , those describing behavior in the low spatial frequency space @xmath7 as @xmath8 and those describing behavior in the high spatial frequency space @xmath9 as @xmath10 , also separates the couplings which @xmath4 describes into four groups , couplings from low - frequency to low - frequency @xmath11 , from low- to high- frequency @xmath12 , from high to low @xmath13 and from high to high @xmath14 .",
    "the above equation then decomposes simply into @xmath15 solving for the @xmath9-space components of the eigenfunction in terms of the @xmath7-space components leads to @xmath16 where the fraction means the inverse of an operator .",
    "a standard technique  @xcite is to substitute equation  ( [ eqn : cqfull ] ) into equation  ( [ eqn : p_ham ] ) in order to generate an effective eigenvalue equation for the @xmath7-space , @xmath17 this equation reduces the problem to the @xmath7-space only .",
    "if standard diagonalization techniques are used , this reduces the time to diagonalize the hamiltonian by a factor of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of basis functions in the @xmath20-space .",
    "however , it is well known that such a decomposition does not necessarily simplify the problem at hand , particularly because inversion of a matrix is computationally intensive and care must be taken in order to achieve self - consistency in the eigenvalue .",
    "we now describe an efficient way to go beyond the standard approach to address each of these issues in turn .    in a plane - wave basis ,",
    "the inversion of @xmath21 can be approximated accurately and simply in a way which will save considerable computational effort , especially when used in conjunction with conjugate gradient techniques .",
    "specifically , because the @xmath9-space contains the high momentum plane - wave states , the kinetic energy dominates @xmath14 , which we may then approximate to be the kinetic energy operator @xmath22 , whose @xmath23 component is @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the kronecker delta and @xmath26 is a reciprocal lattice vector , and atomic units have been assumed .    in principle , the eigenvalues appearing in the left side of equation  ( [ eqn : oldway ] ) must be calculated self - consistently , but this leads to difficulties .",
    "each eigenstate sought then sees a different hamiltonian and orthonormality is lost .",
    "alternately , in practice one employs on the left - hand side a constant , approximate @xmath6 which one hopes to be appropriate for all desired eigenvalues . for us , neither approach is satisfactory . to circumvent these difficulties , we linearize @xmath27 in terms of the eigenvalue @xmath28",
    "note that in a plane - wave basis such an expansion will converge quickly , as the cutoff in the @xmath7-space is , in general , much larger than the eigenvalues of interest .    substituting equation  ( [ eqn : cqtemp ] ) , to linear order in @xmath6 , into equation  ( [ eqn : p_ham ] )",
    ", gives an effective generalized eigenvalue equation , @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the effective single - particle hamiltonian and @xmath31 is a positive - definite overlap matrix .",
    "this equation will generate errors of order @xmath32 in the eigenvalue , where @xmath33 is the cutoff energy for the @xmath7-space .",
    "we below , show that this truncation error proves to be a good measure of the error in the energy per atom .",
    "thus , our method provides for accurate _ a priori _ predictions for transferability errors .",
    "in addition to computing the eigenvalue spectrum , we often require access to the eigenstates , particularly for density functional theory calculations which require self - consistent solution of the electronic states within a potential dependent upon those states . calculation of the self - consistent potential requires not only the @xmath7-space components @xmath34 from ( [ eqn : ham_eff ] ) but also the @xmath9-space components . the most direct choice for generating the @xmath27 is to use equation  ( [ eqn : cqtemp ] ) ; however , we wish to eventually apply this technique to the conjugate gradient method and defining @xmath27 as in equation  ( [ eqn : cqtemp ] ) , no longer preserves orthonormality for the full eigenvector set @xmath2 and post - reorthonormalization can make the conjugate gradient procedure unstable .    to avoid these difficulties , we note that the solutions to the generalize eigenvalue problem ( [ eqn : ham_eff ] ) automatically satisfy @xmath35 where the subscripts indicate the coefficients for individual states @xmath36 and @xmath37 and we have substituted the definition ( [ eqn : overlap ] ) . regrouping terms ,",
    "we find that identically @xmath38 so that the set of complete states @xmath2 will be exactly orthonormal provided we make the identification , @xmath39 which is nothing other than ( [ eqn : cqtemp ] ) truncated at zeroth order .",
    "we thus conclude that to avoid issues of orthonormality to allow simple implementation of conjugate gradient techniques , one _ must _ construct @xmath27 at this order .",
    "accordingly , we employ ( [ eqn : cq ] ) as the construction for @xmath27 throughout the reminder of this work .      to carry out full density - functional calculations based upon the results from the previous section , one in principle first would solve ( [ eqn : ham_eff ] ) using direct diagonalization techniques to find @xmath34 and then construct @xmath27 from ( [ eqn : cq ] ) .",
    "next , from the wave functions , one would update the charge density , hartree and exchange - correlation potentials , recompute @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "finally , one would iterate this procedure to self - consistency . as",
    "this approach is quite similar to the lwdin perturbation theory  @xcite which was used in the mid 1980 s by a number of groups  @xcite with regard to electronic structure calculations , this section briefly reviews the lwdin approach as described in reference   and discuss the major differences between that approach and ours .",
    "the following section , section  [ sec - cg ] , shows how conjugate gradient techniques may be applied directly to our approach but not to lwdin perturbation theory .",
    "lwdin perturbation theory also decomposes behavior into high and low momentum plane - wave states .",
    "this approach also solves an eigenvalue problem @xmath42 for a renormalized hamiltonian @xmath43 similar to that of equation  ( [ eqn : oldway ] ) , @xmath44 self - consistency is reached by calculating the charge density either with @xmath34 alone , or with both @xmath34 and @xmath27 , with @xmath45 here @xmath46 is similar to @xmath43 , except that the first index is in the @xmath9-space . for the reasons discussed above in section  [ sec - diag ] , if @xmath27 is employed , then the wave functions must be re - orthonormalized .    in practice@xcite",
    ", the value employed for @xmath6 in equation  ( [ eqn : low_ham ] ) depends upon the physics under exploration .",
    "thus , prior to the calculation , the shape of the band structure should be approximately known and should have a relatively narrow band - width , requiring great care for the study of systems under unusual physics conditions such as extremely high pressures .",
    "moreover , the approximation of @xmath6 by a constant @xmath47 is always a first order error in the solution to the eigenvalue .",
    "this can simply be seen by taylor expanding equations  ( [ eqn : low_ham ] )  and  ( [ eqn : low_cq ] ) in a similar fashion as equations  ( [ eqn : cqtemp ] )  and  ( [ eqn : ham_eff ] ) .",
    "if @xmath48 is close to @xmath6 , then this error is small as is the next order .",
    "however , if there is a large discrepancy between @xmath6 and @xmath48 , then these errors are _ manifestly _ first order .",
    "this is particularly troublesome for calculations including core electrons where the core states energies have large separations from the valence states .",
    "we thus expect lwdin perturbation to be useful primarily only within a pseudopotential framework . in our approach , by contrast , _ all _ band energies are treating on an equal footing to second order .",
    "this is because equation  ( [ eqn : ham_eff ] ) includes all terms through first order by shifting some terms to the right - hand side to form the generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "the great advantage of lwdin perturbation theory for its time is that it reduces the time for standard diagonalization from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "however , in the mid 1980 s standard diagonalization techniques were dropped in lieu of much more efficient car - parrinello  @xcite and conjugate gradient  @xcite techniques , which , being based on minimization , require the eigenvalue equations to represent the variational derivative of some energy functional . it is not clear that the hamiltonian used within lwdin perturbation theory is a good approximation to the variational derivative of an energy functional .",
    "what particularly complicates this is the dependence of the hamiltonian on the eigenvalue and that the unfolding of the wave vector into the @xmath9-space does not preserve orthonormality .",
    "therefore , it is unclear how one would employ lwdin perturbation theory in conjunction with such optimized minimization techniques .",
    "the next section demonstrates that , in contrast , our approach represents a very good approximation to the variational derivative of an energy functional and , because it preserves orthonormality , can be used directly with optimized minimization techniques .",
    "we first discuss applicability to a traditional conjugate gradient techniques in section  [ sec : trad ] and generalize to the analytic continued approach  @xcite in section  [ sec : analcont ] .",
    "section  [ sec - details ] gives details of our computational implementation and provides specific computational studies of the various approximations and the convergence of the approach .",
    "again , we seek the minimum of an energy functional of the form @xmath1 $ ] as a function of a set of wave function coefficients @xmath2 . to formulate the separation into low- and high- spatial frequency components as a variational principle associated with an energy functional ,",
    "we express the energy functional directly in terms of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 _ before _ taking any variations , @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "we now seek the minimum of this functional subject to the orthonormalization condition @xmath54 here @xmath41 is an overlap matrix , which should give the correct overlap matrix at the minimum of the energy functional .",
    "section  [ sec - details ] will describe the overlap matrix that we use in our calculations .",
    "finally , the @xmath52 are left _",
    "unconstrained_.    the sets @xmath51 and @xmath52 are treated as independent variables .",
    "however , at each @xmath51 point , the functional is directly minimized with respect to the set @xmath52 . the gradients are @xmath55 and @xmath56 where the second term is set to zero , emphasizing that the energy functional is minimized with respect to @xmath52 at each point @xmath51 .",
    "the flowchart in figure  [ fig : flowchart ] describes the minimization procedure within the traditional conjugate gradient framework .",
    "given a point at @xmath51 and @xmath52 , calculate the energy .",
    "next , calculate the gradient for the set @xmath51 , equation  ( [ eqn : gradpold ] )  or  ( [ eqn : gradp ] ) , and hold the set @xmath52 fixed . minimize the energy functional for the set @xmath51 only , along the conjugate direction @xmath57 .",
    "after the functional is minimized along this particular direction , the functional is then minimized with respect to @xmath52 , equation  ( [ eqn : gradq ] ) , by setting @xmath58 finally , this process iterates until the energy functional reaches its minimum .",
    "+    in calculating @xmath59 , we have again approximated @xmath14 by @xmath22 , and therefore do not exactly minimize the functional with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "although the form for @xmath27 is not that which exactly minimizes our functional , we have found the approximation to be sufficiently close that the conjugate gradient technique is quite stable and efficient .",
    "using such a form for @xmath27 , the gradient for @xmath34 indeed becomes @xmath60 where @xmath61 is as defined in equation  ( [ eqn : heff ] ) .",
    "thus , we find that , unlike the lwdin perturbation theory approach , the prescription in section  [ sec - diag ] represents a set of equations that is , to a very good approximation , a variational principle and therefore to be amenable to solution with conjugate gradient methods .    to underscore the effectiveness of conjugate - gradient methods for use within our framework ,",
    "figures  [ fig : hconverge ]  and  [ fig : cconverge ] show the iterative convergence of the total energy within the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite to density - functional theory for cubic hydrogen and an eight atom cell of fcc carbon , respectively .",
    "the calculations use the preconditioner of teter , payne and allen  @xcite , cutoffs of @xmath62  h and @xmath63  h for hydrogen and @xmath64  h and @xmath65  h for carbon , and the overlap operator @xmath41 from section  [ sec - details ] .",
    "the hydrogen calculation uses the pure coulomb potential and an @xmath66 monkhorst - pack  @xcite sampling grid , and the carbon calculation uses the goedecker , teter and hunter pseudopotential  @xcite with simple @xmath67-point sampling . finally , the cubic lattice constants were @xmath68  bohr and @xmath69  bohr for sc hydrogen and fcc carbon , respectively .",
    "+   iteration    it can be seen that the conjugate gradient technique is stable and that fluctuations occur only in the final stages when the error is @xmath70 , well within acceptable convergence .",
    "these fluctuations are associated with the fact that @xmath22 is used instead of @xmath14 . in general , we have found that the stability of the conjugate gradient does not depend on the approximation for @xmath27 , but mainly depends on how and when we update @xmath27 .",
    "table  [ table : energycutoff ] compares the error in the energy per atom with the new approach , with cutoffs stated above , to that with the traditional approach , with cutoff @xmath71 .",
    "the fully converged results are considered to be that of the traditional approach with energy cutoff @xmath72 .",
    "the results for the new procedure show a vast improvement .",
    "+   iteration    as noted above , one of the advantages of our approach is that it allows for an _ a priori _ estimate of the transferability errors .",
    "we define this _ transferability prediction _ as @xmath73 where the sum is over occupied states . for the specific cases of the present two calculations ,",
    "our prediction gives @xmath74 for hydrogen and @xmath75 for carbon , where for simplicity we consider only the 2 s - states .",
    "these predictions also appear in table  [ table : energycutoff ] .",
    "the predicted values are very similar to @xmath76 , demonstrating that this prediction , which may be applied in _ any _ environment , gives sensible estimates of the errors .",

    "our procedure can be easily incorporated into the analytic continued conjugate gradient approach  @xcite .",
    "in such an approach , constrained variables , @xmath2 , are not minimized , but unconstrained variables , @xmath77 , are minimized .",

    "the appendix discusses details for the use of this approach with hard but transferable kleinman - bylander pseudopotentials .",
    "the overlap matrix has the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the inverse of the kinetic energy , @xmath102 is the contribution from the local ionic potential and @xmath103 is the contribution from the hartree and exchange - correlation potentials , which depends on the density .",
    "there are a number of viable options for implementing @xmath41 .",
    "we have explored both the option of fixing @xmath103 , and thus @xmath41 to some value and the option of updating it self - consistently .",
    "the benefit of holding the overlap matrix fixed is that @xmath104 so that equation  ( [ eqn : gradpold ] ) is the exact variational derivative of the energy functional .",
    "the appendix further shows that such a fixed operator makes efficient implementation of kleinman - bylander pseudopotentials possible .",
    "a clear choice for a fixed overlap matrix is to hold @xmath103 in equation  ( [ eqn : over_decomp ] ) to that of the `` free - atom '' crystal , a crystal whose charge density is just the superposition of the charge densities from isolated atoms . in such a case ,",
    "the overlap matrix becomes @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 is hartree and exchange - correlation potential for the `` free - atom '' crystal .",
    "one possible cause for concern when using a fixed overlap matrix is that the orthonormalization is no longer exact ( so that , for instance , the electronic charge will not be precisely conserved ) because @xmath12 in equation  ( [ eqn : cqcg ] ) will differ from its free - atom crystal value .",
    "however , we have found this to never affect the convergence of the calculations and to yield quite accurate results , as figures  [ fig : hconverge ]  and  [ fig : cconverge ] and table  [ table : energycutoff ] show .",
    "alternately , exact orthonormalization can be preserved when using a fixed overlap operator if one chooses to redefine @xmath98 as @xmath108 while this preserves orthonormality among the states , it does give a slightly different approximation to @xmath98 , which causes a slight change in the @xmath61 which should be used in ( [ eqn : ham_eff ] ) .",
    "we find , however , that ignoring this discrepancy makes no practical difference in the final results . with this alternate approach",
    ", the convergence is quite similar to those of figures  [ fig : hconverge ]  and  [ fig : cconverge ] , and the energy per atom is within @xmath109  h , as compared to using equation  ( [ eqn : cqcg ] ) for @xmath98 .",
    "another benefit of using the form equation  ( [ eqn : cqat ] ) comes when using non - local pseudopotentials , as this form is computationally more efficient .",
    "( see the appendix for details . )    finally , the @xmath61 which should be used with the construction in equation  ( [ eqn : cqat ] ) is @xmath110 maintaining this consistency comes at the cost of introducing a slightly non - hermitian hamiltonian . despite this , we again have not experienced any practical problems working with this form .",

    "the term @xmath113 must be calculated for defining @xmath80 , equation  ( [ eqn : up ] ) , and in the gradient , equation  ( [ eqn : gradyp ] ) . the most efficient method for calculating this term is to perform four fourier transforms per electronic wave function , always multiply terms in the space in which they are diagonal .",

    "to calculate the energy for different phases in boron we use our perturbative potential approach with the analytically continued conjugate gradient approach as described in section  [ sec - cg ] with @xmath41 , @xmath98 and @xmath61 calculated as in section  [ sec - demos ] .",
    "all calculations employ the local density approximation with the parameterization of perdew - zunger  @xcite to the ceperley - alder  @xcite exchange - correlation energy .",

    "we consider these orthorhombic structures for a number of reasons .",
    "zhu and henley  @xcite have shown that for 6-coordinated boron under high pressure the triangular lattice is a good candidate for a low energy , high pressure phase , within the density functional theory pseudopotential framework  @xcite and furthermore such sheets tend to buckle  @xcite . because the gallium structure can be viewed as stacked sheets of a highly buckled triangular lattice , such a structure is a good candidate for a high pressure phase of boron .",
    "secondly , gallium is another group iii element which has as its ground - state structure @xmath20-gallium at low pressures and @xmath131-gallium at high pressures@xcite , and being under boron in the periodic table supports the notion that such structures are good candidates for a high pressure phase of boron .",
    "below , we show that these structures play quite important roles .",

    "we have tested this ratio for a number of high pressure states and have found the ideal ratio to remain constant over a wide range of pressures .",
    "hence , we hold @xmath134 at this value for all calculations in our study , and thus our bct energies results represent a quite close upper - bound .    for the 12 structure",

    "note that we do not optimize the lattice vector ratios or the internal coordinates for the orthorhombic structures for boron but here hold them fixed to that of gallium at standard conditions .",
    "therefore , the energies which we report for these structures should be regarded simply as upper bounds .",
    "similarly , we do not optimize the lattice vectors and/or internal coordinates for the bct and 12 structures , however this latter optimization proves to be minor .",
    "zhao and lu  @xcite have recently performed pseudopotential calculations , for the fcc , bct and 12 structures , and found that fully relaxing these structures only decrease the transition pressure ( bct @xmath130 12 ) by 5% , when using the local density approximation , as compared to reference  .",
    "therefore , because these latter effects are minor near the semiconducting / metallic transition pressure and in order to allow our method a greater comparison with pseudopotential results we choose to hold the parameters for the bct and 12 structures fixed to those used in reference  .",
    "we now establish plane wave cutoffs for our specific study which will both make for practical calculations ( particularly for the 12 structure ) and give accurate structural energy differences .",
    "for this we shall compare the energy per atom as a function of volume for the fcc , bct and 12 .",

    "the curves from the figure are simple fits to @xmath149     + volume per atom [ @xmath121 ]    having established previously that the above cutoffs give extremely good energy differences , we then searched for possible reductions in the cutoffs which continue to reproduce these results accurately .",
    "we find reducing the cutoffs to 200 ryd for the @xmath7-space and 1200 ryd for the @xmath9-space to both lead to efficient calculations and to give highly accurate results .",

    "figure  [ fig : evsv_200 ] shows a similar plot , where the points are the plane wave data and the curves represent the fit to the fully converged results .",
    "note that , although fcc structure is fairly well converged at this low cutoff , there are rather large errors for the 12 structure .",
    "thus , such a low cutoff is unreliable for the study of such systems .",
    "the fact the low cutoff represents one structure well and not another demonstrates the unpredictability of transferability errors , underscores the need to predict those errors reliably , and places pseudopotential studies of such systems , which assume that errors in processes at such high energy scales cancel , in doubt .",

    "the time for the matrix multiplication correspondingly reduces by a factor of 6 and for the fourier transforms by a factor of 3 , similar to section  [ sec - demos ] .",
    "because of these savings , particularly in memory , all of our calculations below were possible on a single desktop computer and there was no need for parallel supercomputing .",
    "having found appropriate plane wave cutoffs , we next converged both the brillouin sampling and the fictitious fermi temperature .",
    "we find that a fictitious fermi temperature of @xmath153 converges the total energy to a within a few tenths of a millihartree per atom ( @xmath154 for the fcc structure ) .",
    "for the fcc and bct structures , brillouin sampling on 6@xmath1486@xmath1486 and 4@xmath1484@xmath1486 meshes , respectively , suffice to converge the total energy per atom to within the same tolerance .",
    "we then generate meshes for the remaining structures by maintaining the same reciprocal space sampling density as closely as possible , resulting in meshes of size 2@xmath1482@xmath1482 , 4@xmath1484@xmath1484 and 6@xmath1484@xmath1486 for the 12 , and structures , respectively .",
    "+   volume per atom [ @xmath121 ]    figure  [ fig : evsv ] shows our final results , which are converged to within a few tenth of a millihartree per atom .",
    "most notably , we find a new phase , the , to be the lowest in energy phase under high pressure .",
    "boron becomes energetically favorable over 12 boron at a pressure of 71 gpa , and remains the energetically favored phase up to the highest pressures we have studied , which are over 500 gpa , where the pressure is determined from the enthalpy .",
    "although there are other stable structures governed by the icosahedron in boron , due to the dramatic rise in energy of the 12 structure , we do not expect these alternate structures to have significantly lower energies .",
    "moreover , zhao and lu  @xcite have preformed preliminary pseudopotential calculations with the @xmath131-b@xmath155 unit cell , part of the icosahedral family , and find similar trends between this structure and the 12 structure . finally , optimizing the lattice vectors ratios for the orthorhombic phases will only make them more favorable",
    "we , therefore , expect our prediction of a phase transition from the icosahedral family to the structure to be robust .    as a point of comparison to the pseudopotential calculation@xcite , which had not considered the orthorhombic structures , ignoring those structures",
    ", we also find the sequence of transitions 12 @xmath130 bct @xmath130 fcc .",
    "our value of 194  gpa for the first of these transitions agrees reasonably well with the pseudopotential result of 210  gpa .",
    "however , our prediction of @xmath156  gpa for the second transition differs substantial from the pseudopotential result of 360  gpa .",
    "these discrepancy most likely results from the inadequacies of the pseudopotential to effectively account for the response within the core .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig : evsv_200 ] demonstrates the importance of momentum transfers over 200  ryd and hence variations @xmath157 0.44 a@xmath158 , where a@xmath158 is the bohr radius , well within the core region .",
    "this underscores the importance of control over transferability and properly accounting for the core region when studying high pressure systems",
    ".     +   level [ ev ]     +   level [ ev ]    given the availability of high - pressure resistivity data for boron@xcite , it is interesting to consider the electronic structure of the hitherto unexplored phases for boron . figures  [ fig : ds_alpha ]  and  [ fig : ds_beta ] show low - resolution plots of the density of states for and boron at 250  gpa and 217  gpa , respectively , as generated using the brillouin zone sampling from the total energy calculations .",
    "the plots have low resolution because , as is well known , meshes which give reliable total energies often are too modest to give detailed density of states .",
    "( providing smooth curves required a gaussian broadening of width 1  ev . )",
    "the figures clearly show that , whereas the phase is semimetallic , the density of states of the phase clearly exhibits a gap at the fermi level , even at high pressures .",
    "experimentally , the room - temperature resistance of boron decreases discontinuously as a function of pressure at 30  gpa , 110  gpa and 170  gpa@xcite . in comparing our results to these data ,",
    "it is important to recall that the 12 structure is only meant to be representative of the icosahedral family of low - pressure structures and that , with optimization of the aspect ratios and internal coordinates , the curves for the and structures will displace to even lower energies .",
    "in particular , a downward shift of only 0.15  ev (  10% ) in the curve would lower our prediction for the 12@xmath130transition from 71  gpa to 30  gpa .",
    "thus , while further investigation is clearly needed , these data suggest that a structural transition from the icosahedral family to the orthorhombic phase is a viable candidate for the resistance discontinuity observed in boron at 30 gpa .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the structure ( cmca space group ) was also observed to be stable low energy , high pressure phases for both lithium and sodium  @xcite , within density functional theory .",
    "because boron is observed experimentally to be metallic above 160  gpa , our results imply that another , yet unexplored , structure must become energetically favored at this pressure and be responsible for the highest of the observed discontinuities in the room - temperature resistance .",
    "whatever this metallic structure is , it can not be simple as the fcc , bct , bcc  @xcite and ideal hcp  @xcite structures because none are competitive at high pressures .",
    "it is suggestive , however , that our energetic upper - bound for the metallic structure is quite competitive with the fcc and bct structures at the very highest pressures .",
    "although further calculations would certainly be needed to verify this conjecture , it is quite possible that the observed discontinuity in the resistivity at 170  gpa represents a structural transition from the semiconducting to the metallic phase .",
    "moreover , it is unclear if pseudopotential calculations will give the accuracy needed in this transition region .",
    "we have developed a new method which allows for dramatic reduction in the number of plane waves needed in all - electron density functional theory calculations or in calculations with hard , but highly transferable pseudopotentials .",
    "the foundation of the approach is to treat the higher energy plane wave components of the electronic states implicitly through a perturbative approach , thereby allowing these components to be recovered quickly only when needed , thus alleviating memory storage requirements by factors as high as fifteen in practical calculations .",
    "the approach lends itself well to current optimized minimization techniques such as conjugate gradient methods and has the benefit of allowing quantitative estimates of transferability to new systems for which there is little or no experience and for which the transferability of pseudopotentials is in question , such as condensed matter at high pressure where effects in the core region become much more important .",
    "in addition , the first application of this approach has led to new intriguing conjectures as to the structure of boron at high pressures .",
    "we have carried out the first _ ab initio _ calculations of the orthorhombic structures of boron , which we show to play an important role in the high pressure behavior of this material .",
    "we find that , prior to becoming metallic , boron makes a phase transition from the icosahedral family to the semiconducting structure .",
    "the low energy of this semiconducting phase indicates that the structure of the superconducting phase for boron is more complicated that the simple monotonic lattices explored to date .",
    "while further calculations including optimization of the lattice ratios for the orthorhombic phases are needed , our results lead to the conjecture that the metallic structure is a good candidate for the superconducting phase .",
