    "a technical complication is that the massive gell - mann low function can only be solved numerically due to the complexity of the obtained results and that it is scheme dependent already at one loop .",
    "the latter point can be ameliorated by expressing other physical charges through @xmath0 and using the conformal ansatz @xcite .",

    "was observed which characterizes the residual scheme dependence of the two loop predictions for this observable . in a similar way , all other effective charges can be described .",
    "other possible applications include the effect of a massive charm on the bottom mass determination . here",
    "massive charm corrections to the potential and in the running coupling could potentially lead to a shift in the bottom mass of @xmath41 and thus would need to be included into a proper analysis .",
