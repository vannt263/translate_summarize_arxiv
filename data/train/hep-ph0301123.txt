    "the proposal of a `` soft - collinear effective theory '' ( scet ) for the strong interactions of collinear and soft particles has been an important step toward understanding the factorization properties of hard exclusive processes in qcd @xcite . in particular",
    ", it raises the prospects for rigorously proving qcd factorization theorems for hadronic and radiative @xmath2-meson decays into light particles such as @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite , which are of great importance to the physics program at the @xmath2 factories .",
    "a challenge common to these decays and many others is to understand the interactions of collinear particles with the soft spectator quark inside the @xmath2 meson , which give rise to convolutions of hard - scattering kernels with @xmath2-meson light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) .",
    "the first systematic analysis of these interactions in the framework of scet has recently been performed by two of us @xcite .",
    "the radiative , semileptonic decay @xmath0 provides a clean environment for the study of soft - collinear interactions @xcite .",
    "this process is particularly simple in that no hadrons appear in the final state . yet , there is sensitivity to the light - cone structure of the @xmath2 meson , probed by the coupling of the high - energy photon to the soft spectator quark inside the heavy meson . in the present paper ,",
    "we apply the formalism of @xcite to prove factorization for this decay and systematically resum large sudakov logarithms .",
    "the arguments we will present apply , with minimal modifications , to more complicated decays such as @xmath6 .",
    "several other groups have recently studied the decay @xmath0 . in @xcite a qcd factorization formula was established at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath7 , and it was demonstrated that the leading - order lcda of the @xmath2 meson is sufficient to describe the decay amplitude at leading power in @xmath1 ( with @xmath8 a typical hadronic scale ) , contrary to the findings of @xcite .",
    "qcd factorization formulae have also been proposed for the related processes @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "arguments in favor of factorization in higher orders were given in @xcite using a formulation of scet different from the one adopted here .",
    "in the present work we provide the first complete proof of factorization for a @xmath2 decay in which hard - spectator interactions are relevant at leading power .",
    "we believe that our approach is simpler and more transparent than that put forward in @xcite .",
    "the discussion of factorization we will present is more complete in that we prove the absence of non - valence fock - state contributions and the convergence of the convolution integral to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we present the first correct result for the perturbative hard - scattering kernel in a scheme which uses the conventional , mass - independent definition of the lcda .",
    "in addition , we discuss in detail the complete renormalization - group ( rg ) resummation of large logarithms . to this end , we solve evolution equations for the different components of the hard - scattering kernel , which follow from the renormalization properties of the @xmath2-meson lcda . in this context",
    "we clarify the connection between the anomalous dimension of heavy - collinear currents in scet and the cusp anomalous dimension encountered in the study of wilson loops with light - like segments @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to establish the qcd factorization formula @xcite @xmath11 to all orders in perturbation theory and at leading power in @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the electric charge of the up - quark ( in units of @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the @xmath2-meson decay constant , @xmath15 is a leading - order lcda of the @xmath2-meson , and @xmath16 is a perturbative hard - scattering kernel .",
    "factorization holds as long as the photon is energetic in the @xmath2-meson rest frame , meaning that @xmath17 is of the order of the @xmath18-quark mass .",
    "the physics underlying the factorization formula is that a high - energy photon coupling to the soft constituents of the @xmath2-meson produces quantum fluctuations far off their mass shell , which can be integrated out in a low - energy effective theory .",
    "specifically , when the photon couples to the @xmath18-quark it takes it off shell by an amount of order @xmath19 , producing a hard quantum fluctuation that can be treated using the methods of heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "( the resulting contribution to the amplitude is , in fact , power suppressed . )",
    "when the photon couples to a soft light parton inside the @xmath2 meson it produces a `` hard - collinear '' mode that is off shell by an amount of order @xmath20 .",
    "once these short - distance modes are integrated out , the decay amplitude factorizes into a soft component ( the lcda ) and a hard - scattering kernel .    for the analysis of the @xmath0 decay amplitude we work in the @xmath2-meson rest frame and choose the photon momentum along the @xmath21 direction , such that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a light - like vector .",
    "the two transverse polarization states of the photon can be expressed in terms of the basis vectors @xmath24 , which correspond to left- and right - circular polarization , respectively .",
    "it is convenient to define a second light - cone vector @xmath25 .",
    "any 4-vector can then be expanded as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    in order to prove the factorization formula ( [ ff ] )",
    "one needs to show that @xcite :    1 .",
    "the decay amplitude can be expanded in powers of transverse momenta and , at leading order , can be expressed in terms of a convolution with the @xmath2-meson lcda as shown in ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "after subtraction of infrared contributions corresponding to the @xmath2-meson decay constant and lcda , the leading contributions to the amplitude come from hard internal lines , i.e. , the hard - scattering kernel @xmath29 is free of infrared singularities to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "3 .   the convolution integral of the hard - scattering kernel with the lcda is convergent .",
    "non - valence fock states do not give rise to leading contributions .",
    "in @xcite the authors have discussed factorization for the decay @xmath0 , albeit without addressing the last two points in this list .",
    "( the same criticism applies to the treatment of factorization for the decay @xmath30 presented in @xcite . )",
    "the verification of the third point is in essence a check that one has correctly identified the infrared degrees of freedom in the effective low - energy theory .",
    "if the integral in ( [ ff ] ) diverged for @xmath31 , this would imply that in addition to the hard - collinear modes mentioned above one would need to consider long - distance contributions from internal momenta collinear with the photon momentum , which are off - shell by an amount of order @xmath32 .",
    "the fourth point addresses contributions from non - valence fock states , which in the present case correspond to @xmath2-meson matrix elements of trilocal @xmath33 operators .",
    "while local operators of this type would be of higher dimension and hence power suppressed , non - local operators can contribute at leading power if their component fields are smeared over domains of size @xmath34 @xcite . in the following section we will address all of the above and ,",
    "on the example of @xmath0 decay , provide the first complete proof of a qcd factorization theorem including hard - spectator interactions .    before entering the technical details of the factorization proof ,",
    "we stress that ( [ ff ] ) provides the simplest example of a factorization formula for a decay in which the hard - scattering mechanism involves three different mass scales : a hard scale @xmath35 , a soft scale @xmath36 , and an intermediate scale @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , a diagrammatic analysis of one - loop diagrams for the decay amplitude reveals that leading contributions arise from three different regions of loop momenta : hard momenta @xmath38 , soft momenta @xmath39 , and hard - collinear momenta scaling like @xmath40 .",
    "this suggests a second stage of `` perturbative '' factorization @xcite , which we will establish below .",
    "it says that the hard - scattering kernel itself can be factorized as @xmath41 the hard component @xmath42 accounts for the short - distance corrections from quantum fluctuations that are off shell by an amount of order @xmath19 .",
    "they arise from the coupling of hard or hard - collinear particles to the heavy quark .",
    "the jet function @xmath43 accounts for short - distance fluctuations that are off shell by an amount of order @xmath20 , which result from the coupling of hard - collinear particles to the light spectator quark .",
    "the factorization formula ( [ fact2 ] ) thus separates the physics on two different short - distance scales .",
    "while this is necessary to gain full control over large logarithms arising in the perturbative calculation of the hard - scattering kernel , it is not a necessary step in the proof of the qcd factorization formula ( [ ff ] ) , which describes the separation of short- and long - distance physics .",
    "we use the formulation of scet developed in @xcite , where it was argued that the discussion of exclusive @xmath2 decays into light particles can be made most transparent by matching full qcd amplitudes onto a low - energy effective theory in which only long - distance modes are kept as dynamical degrees of freedom . in the present case",
    "the @xmath2 meson is the only hadron in the process , and so the relevant degrees of freedom in the low - energy effective theory are soft partons .",
    "the strong - interaction lagrangian consists of the ordinary qcd lagrangian for light quarks and gluons ( restricted to the subspace of soft fourier modes ) and of the hqet lagrangian for heavy quarks . in the full theory the hadronic part of the decay amplitude",
    "is given by the @xmath2-meson matrix element of the time - ordered product of a weak , flavor - changing current and the electromagnetic current . at leading order in the effective theory",
    "this object is matched onto flavor - changing bilocal operators of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the photon field , @xmath46 is the effective - theory field for the heavy @xmath18-quark , and @xmath47 is the field for a soft @xmath48-quark .",
    "the separation @xmath21 between the fields is nearly light - like , @xmath49 .",
    "a space - time picture of the decay process is as follows : the virtual light quark produced at the weak vertex is off shell by an amount of order @xmath20 and almost collinear with the photon direction .",
    "the electromagnetic vertex is thus located at a distance @xmath50 relative to the weak vertex , where @xmath51 is the parametrically largest component .",
    "because of the scaling properties of the photon and soft spectator momenta one can replace @xmath52 and @xmath53 to leading power . from the discussion in @xcite , it follows that at leading order in @xmath1 there exists a unique type of scet operators that mediate this decay and are allowed by gauge and reparameterization invariance .",

    "the combination @xmath59 appearing in the last line of ( [ ops ] ) represents a soft wilson line connecting the two points @xmath60 and @xmath61 on a straight segment .",
    "physically , this string operator arises because the virtual quark propagating between the two vertices can emit multiple soft gluons without power suppression .",

    "we have @xmath63 the feynman rule for this object is simply @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the photon polarization vector .",
    "finally , from the fact that the leptonic weak current @xmath66 is conserved ( in the limit where the lepton mass is neglected ) it follows that the relevant dirac structures @xmath67 in ( [ ops ] ) can be taken as @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    in the last step in ( [ ops ] )",
    "we have used that the photon momentum @xmath70 is an external momentum , so that the integration over @xmath71 can be performed and leads to new coefficients @xmath72 . note that the scalar products @xmath73 and @xmath74 are both determined in terms of the photon energy ; however , for a while it will be useful to distinguish between these two variables .",
    "scet power counting shows that the soft fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 scale like @xmath77 , the integration variable @xmath78 scales like @xmath34 , and the wilson coefficients @xmath79 scale like 1 .",
    "it follows that the hadronic components of the scet operators on the right - hand side of ( [ ops ] ) scale like @xmath32 , which is one power of @xmath8 less than a local current containing two soft quark fields . that one can write down such operators is a consequence of the fact that transverse collinear fields have unsuppressed interactions with soft light quarks @xcite . as a result , at leading power",

    "the two distribution amplitudes obey the normalization @xmath86 at @xmath87 . in our case @xmath88 , and because of the presence of the factor @xmath89 in ( [ ops ] ) it follows that only the function @xmath90 contributes , to which we refer as _ the _ leading - order lcda .",
    "note that with our choice of the light - cone basis vector @xmath91 we have @xmath92 . performing the relevant traces over dirac matrices",

    "the fact that the position - space scet operators appearing on the right - hand side of ( [ ops ] ) contain component fields with light - like separation implies that transverse parton momenta can be set to zero at leading power . as we have seen",
    ", this naturally leads to the appearance of lcdas . in scet",
    "the hard - scattering kernel @xmath29 is identified with a wilson coefficient .",
    "the absence of infrared singularities then follows from the very existence of a low - energy effective theory , because wilson coefficients arise from matching and by construction are insensitive to infrared physics . at this point",
    "we have achieved as much as @xcite .",
    "we proceed to prove the convergence of the convolution integral in ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "the key ingredient here is to note that the invariance of scet operators under reparameterizations of the light - cone basis vectors @xmath91 and @xmath102 @xcite can be used to deduce the dependence of wilson coefficient functions on the separation @xmath78 between the component fields of non - local operators @xcite . in our case ,",
    "invariance of the operators in ( [ ops ] ) under the rescaling transformation @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( with fixed @xmath82 ) implies that @xmath105 to all orders in perturbation theory . in other words , the variables @xmath78 and @xmath106 can only appear in the combination @xmath107 , but",
    "not individually .",
    "( similarly , the variable @xmath78 enters the argument of the lcda in ( [ lcda ] ) in the reparameterization - invariant combination @xmath108 . ) in the second step we have used the fact that @xmath109 and @xmath110 enter only through interactions of hard or hard - collinear gluons with the heavy quark .",
    "the corresponding modes can be integrated out in a first matching step and lead to the functions @xmath111 , which depend on the dirac structure of the weak current containing the heavy quark .",
    "the non - localities of the component fields in ( [ ops ] ) result from the coupling of hard - collinear fields to the soft spectator quark in the @xmath2 meson .",
    "these effects live on scales of order @xmath20 and can be integrated out in a second step , leading to the function @xmath112 .",
    "since the coefficients @xmath79 are dimensionless , it follows that ( with a slight abuse of notation ) @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a scaling variable of order 1 .",
    "corrections to this perturbative factorization formula are suppressed by a ratio of the intermediate scale @xmath115 and a hard scale of order @xmath19 .",
    "( while the fact that these corrections scale like @xmath1 is an immediate consequence of our discussion here , it is not obvious in the context of the approach proposed in @xcite , which is based on an expansion in powers of @xmath116 . ) the corresponding result for the hard - scattering kernel obtained after fourier transformation has the form shown in ( [ fact2 ] ) if we identify @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "since the dependence of the coefficient functions on the renormalization scale is logarithmic , it follows that to all orders in perturbation theory the wilson coefficients in ( [ ciscal ] ) scale like @xmath119 modulo logarithms .",
    "( correspondingly , the kernel scales like @xmath120 modulo logarithms . ) the convergence of the convolution integral in ( [ ampl ] ) in the infrared region @xmath121 , corresponding to the region @xmath31 in the factorization formula ( [ ff ] ) , then follows to all orders in perturbation theory as long as the integral converges at tree level .",
    "because the @xmath2 meson has a spatial size of order @xmath34 due to confinement , the bilocal matrix element must vanish faster than @xmath122 for @xmath123 , and so the integral over @xmath78 is convergent .",
    "the absence of endpoint divergences in convolution integrals is tied to the question of whether the infrared degrees of freedom have correctly been identified in the effective theory @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate this point on the case at hand .",
    "assume the integral over @xmath124 in ( [ ff ] ) diverged logarithmically for @xmath31 .",
    "this would indicate that there were leading - power contributions to the decay amplitude from regions where intermediate propagators ( such as the quark propagator in figure  [ fig : tree ] below ) are collinear with the external photon .",
    "in addition to the modes we call hard - collinear one then had to include other , long - distance collinear modes in the construction of the effective theory , which would invalidate factorization .",
    "the decay amplitude would then be sensitive to the hadronic structure of the photon as well as the full bethe ",
    "salpeter wave function of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "our demonstration that the region @xmath31 is power suppressed is thus an essential ingredient of the factorization proof .",
    "the final step in the factorization proof is to demonstrate the power suppression of more complicated projections onto the @xmath2 meson involving higher fock states or transverse parton momenta .",
    "the fact that such projections do not contribute at leading power follows from the rules for constructing scet operators out of gauge - invariant building blocks , as explained in @xcite .",
    "projections sensitive to transverse momentum components contain extra derivatives and so are power suppressed .",
    "projections corresponding to non - valence fock states contain insertions of the soft ( subscript `` @xmath71 '' ) gluon field @xmath125(x )     = \\int_{-\\infty}^0\\!dw\\,n_\\alpha\\,\\big [ s^\\dagger g g_s^{\\alpha\\nu }     s \\big](x+wn ) \\,.\\ ] ] since @xmath126 scales like @xmath8 , such insertions lead to power suppression unless this field is integrated over a domain of extension @xmath34 .",
    "it follows that the only possibility for a leading - power contribution from non - valence fock states would be to include a factor of @xmath127 with @xmath128 ( up to dimensionless wilson coefficients of order 1 ) .",
    "an example of such an hqet operator ( omitting gauge strings and dirac structures ) is @xmath129 , which is indeed of leading order @xmath130 in power counting .",
    "reparameterization invariance requires that this object must be accompanied by an additional factor of @xmath91 in the numerator .",
    "scales like @xmath102 , and that the basis vectors @xmath91 and @xmath102 always come in pairs since they are introduced through the light - cone decomposition of 4-vectors . the only alternative to having",
    "a factor of @xmath91 in the numerator would be to add a factor of @xmath131 or @xmath132 , both of which scale like @xmath1 and thus would lead to power suppression .",
    "] since @xmath133 by definition , the only possibility would be to include an insertion of @xmath134 somewhere between the light - quark field @xmath135 and the dirac matrix @xmath67 in the scet operators in ( [ ops ] ) .",
    "however , any such insertion vanishes , since @xmath136 .",
    "it is important for this argument that the heavy quark can be integrated out before one removes the off - shell modes resulting from soft - collinear interactions .",
    "the heavy quark therefore decouples from such interactions .",
    "this ensures that the factor @xmath89 can not appear to the right of @xmath67 , and it excludes the appearance of @xmath137 instead of @xmath89 .",
    "we have thus completed the proof of the factorization formula ( [ ff ] ) to all orders in perturbation theory , and at leading power in @xmath1 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to the calculation of the hard - scattering kernel at nlo in rg - improved perturbation theory , including a complete resummation of large logarithms .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath79 in ( [ ops ] ) are derived by matching perturbative expressions for operator matrix elements in the full theory onto corresponding expressions in the effective theory . because by construction the wilson coefficients are insensitive to infrared physics the matching can be done using on - shell external quark states .",
