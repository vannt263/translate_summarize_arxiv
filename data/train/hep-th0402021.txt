    "the universe appears to be accelerating , but the reason why is yet to be explored .",
    "cosmologists are trying to confirm the hypothesis of a dark universe , providing two alternative candidates for the dark energy  a positive cosmological constant and a variable @xmath0-term , like a slowly varying scalar potential ; both exert a gravitationally self - repulsive force .",
    "one would hold out less hope of understanding the dark energy ( or cosmic acceleration ) unless or until there is a unified theory with a compelling particle - physics motivation that takes it closer to the bedrock of space and time .",
    "the usual idea in superstring or m theory is that spacetime is a four dimensional nearly flat metric times a small six or seven dimensional internal manifold .",
    "the current interest in cosmology with the extra ( spatial ) dimensions is two fold : + ( i ) can inflation and/or observed cosmic acceleration naturally arise from string or m theory compactification on some non - trivial curved internal spaces of time - varying volume  @xcite , explaining the scale of the dark energy  @xcite .",
    "+ ( ii ) can one derive a scalar potential from string theory compactification , with static and warped extra dimensions , that has at least one stationary point with @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "one of the obstacles for a warped de sitter type compactification is a no - go theorem  @xcite .",
    "the strong energy condition holds for all @xmath2 or @xmath3 supergravities . if one takes the extra dimensions to be warped ( and static ) ,",
    "then for the compactified theory ( with or without form - fields in the extra dimensions ) , one finds @xmath4 , which does not allow the universe to accelerate .",
    "it seems less likely that a ( false ) de sitter state one may obtain in warped string theory background , with static extra dimensions , is responsible for cosmic acceleration , because such a vacuum is too unstable for a significant period of inflation to occur . in certain cases",
    ", it may be possible to have late time accelerated expansion from a tachyonic potential  @xcite .",
    "the models like @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or their hybrids , do not deal with the basic puzzles such as that of the initial singularity , nor with the mystery behind dark energy indicated by recent observation .",
    "so it might be worthwhile to carefully consider the string or m theory compactification in time dependent backgrounds .",
    "i shall argue that the dark energy of the universe is possibly a gravitational scalar potential arising from slowly varying size of extra dimensions , and so it is dynamical .",
    "let us recall that the four - dimensional part of a @xmath7 dimensional metric spacetime is the usual flrw universe in the standard coordinate ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 the metric on a unit two - sphere , and @xmath11 the time - dependent scale factor .",
    "this gives @xmath12 and inflating spacetime implies that @xmath13 .",
    "the strong energy condition must be violated during inflation . to this end",
    ", we may allow the internal space to be time - dependent .",
    "as the simplest possibility , one can consider that the m theory spacetime is @xmath14 : @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the compact hyperbolic manifold ( chm ) .",
    "there is a mass gap and the kaluza - klein excitations of the metric are heavy ; @xmath20 around @xmath21 . the field @xmath22 associated with the size and shape of extra dimensions has an effective potential due to the curvature of the internal space . with the 4-form field",
    "@xmath23}=2b \\mbox{vol}(\\sigma_{k_1,m})$ ] , @xmath24 being the flux parameter , upon the dimensional reduction we get  @xcite @xmath25}{2}- \\frac{m(m+2)}{4 }",

    "the size and shape of the extra dimensions are four - dimensional scalars . in the effective 4d theory , with a canonically normalized scalar @xmath27 , one considers the lagrangian density @xmath28-(\\partial\\varphi)^2 - 2v(\\varphi )        \\right).\\ ] ] the scalar potential @xmath29 , for @xmath18 , takes the following form @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath29 could vary gradually as the universe expands , which must be large during inflation , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it must also be cancelled to extreme accuracy after inflation to allow the usual radiation and matter dominated eras , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the equations of motion we need to solve are @xmath37 the curvature of the spatial part of the metric @xmath38 is related to the total energy density of the universe , so this term can not be zero precisely . in any case , for @xmath39 , it is convenient to define a new logarithmic time variable @xmath40 by @xmath41 with @xmath42 , a class of expanding solutions ( in units @xmath43 ) is  @xcite @xmath44 up to a shift of @xmath40 around @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "the solution found in  @xcite corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "one has @xmath48 .",
    "the critical value @xmath49 separates qualitatively the different cosmologies ; the solutions with @xmath50 are only transiently accelerating ( even if @xmath51 ) , while , for @xmath52 , the accelerated expansion may be eternal , although @xmath53 is not obtainable from the compactification of classical supergravities ; the m - theory case is @xmath54    for @xmath55 , to lowest order , the zero - flux solution , with @xmath56 , is @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "these are not inflationary solutions , in the usual sense , specifically , if one is expecting @xmath61-efolds or more , rather they may be the solutions responsible for the current cosmic acceleration .",
    "it is healthy to keep in mind that , for the late time cosmology ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) , there is no need to solve the flatness ( i.e. , why @xmath63 ) and horizon problems .",
    "rather , one should really look for such a solution around @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , with the scale factor @xmath66 , by satisfying @xmath67 .    for a non - zero field strength parameter @xmath24 ( and/or a bulk cosmological constant ) , which might serve as a source term , the late time ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) cosmic acceleration can be eternal for the coupling @xmath68 , if @xmath55 .",
    "this observation is not totally new , which was made before , but rather implicitly , in the work of halliwell  @xcite , using a phase - plane method , but the effects of flux were not considered there . for @xmath55 , it is possible that there arise two periods of cosmic acceleration .",
    "more discussions with two or more scalar fields will appear in a separate publication .",
    "is it possible to tune the m theory motivated potential to the present value of the vacuum energy , so called cosmological constant ?",
    "this is indeed an interesting question . in the m theory case @xmath69 , and",
    "so @xmath70 , one has @xmath71 the first exponent @xmath72 is within the limit where astronomical data might be relevant , @xmath73  @xcite . if @xmath74 , in order to get @xmath75 , one requires @xmath76 , in 4d planck units .",
    "such a ( large ) shift in the value of @xmath27 is not impossible during the 13.7 billion years evolution of our universe , but much of this shift should have been during inflation and/or radiation dominated era . as the cosmology around @xmath77 is not smoothly extrapolated to the present epoch ( @xmath78 , the shift in @xmath27 with @xmath79 need not be uniform .",
    "the universe appeared to have gone through various phase transitions , from the early pure vacuum dominated era ( @xmath80 ) to the current era , where @xmath81 .    for our purpose",
    ", it is rather important to know what is the factor by which the size of the compact internal space may have grown up . in terms of 4d metric , strictly speaking , to a 4d observer , the growth factor ( say @xmath82 ) is @xmath83 for @xmath69 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , one has @xmath86 , which is still interesting value .",
    "let me elaborate a little on the issue of size of the internal space ( and its associated mass gap ) .",
    "the authors in reference  @xcite argued that the @xmath87 ( in 4d planck units ) , which is closer to the current hubble scale @xmath88 and is phenomenologically unacceptable .",
    "this estimation is rough and presumably incorrect .",
    "the geometric bound on kk modes arising from the hyperbolic compactification scales with @xmath89 ( or ricci curvature ) , other than the diameter , and not generically with the volume of the manifold . for a tentative value of @xmath90 ,",
    "@xmath91 only if one allows @xmath92 . the lower bound for @xmath93 may be pushed up for the @xmath51 solution , by making @xmath94 small . to have a qualitative picture , consider the following solution , which follows from @xmath7 dimensional field equations ,",

    "the constant @xmath99 has the dimension of inverse time . by suitably choosing the flux parameter @xmath24 or the curvature radius @xmath100 ( or both ) , it is possible to suppress the growth in the size of the internal space , so that all eigenmodes of laplace - beltrami operator on a compact hyperbolic space have wavelengths less than @xmath101 .    in summary , for a spatially flat flrw universe ,",
    "if dominated by an exponential potential of a scalar field , @xmath102 , the observed spell of cosmic acceleration is only a transient phenomenon for @xmath50 , and eternal for @xmath52 .",
    "for all known classical compactifications of 10 or 11d supergravities on some non - trivial curved internal spaces ( with or without fluxes ) only @xmath103 arises in practice .",
    "so one is led to explore alternatives for the observed cosmic acceleration . for @xmath50",
    ", the cosmic acceleration can be eternal if the curvature of the spatial section of our universe is negative on large scales , although the observable universe seems to be well described by flat euclidean geometry .",
    "it is plausible that the dark energy of the universe is the gravitational scalar potential that arises naturally from slowly varying size of extra dimensions . the spatial curvature @xmath104 , which might be negative , was significantly important during the early - time inflationary periods",
