    "we performed density functional theory ( dft ) calculations considering various full potential all electron codes , such as wien2k  @xcite , elk  @xcite , and fplo  @xcite using the generalized gradient approximation functional in its pbe form  @xcite , and verified that the results agree reasonably well among different codes .",
    "such comparison is particularly important because the codes implement the spin - orbit coupling in slightly different ways , employing usually unimportant , but in principle unequal approximations . in the _",
    "non - relativistic _ calculations the core electrons were treated fully relativistically and the valence electrons non - relativistically ( scalar relativistic approximation ) . in",
    "the _ fully relativistic _",
    "calculations , _ i.e. _ with inclusion of spin - orbit coupling , all electrons were treated fully relativistically .",
    "we considered the c@xmath114 crystal structure as given in ref .   and shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] .",
    "we used projective wannier functions as implemented in the fplo basis  @xcite to determine a tight - binding ( tb ) representation for the ir @xmath25 bands . in figure",
    "[ fig : wannierbs ] we show the dft band structure together with the bands corresponding to the wannier representation and the tb bands derived from this representation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wannier ] we present the projective wannier functions for the @xmath25 orbitals of one ir site .",
    "the wannier functions exhibit the typical shape of the @xmath25 functions at the ir site .",
    "besides , they show a clear asymmetry due to na as well as tails on the o sites .               in order to analyze the contribution to the non - relativistic band structure of the various tight - binding hopping parameters and its relation to the quasi - molecular orbital ( qmo ) picture , we present in fig .  [ fig : restrictedbs ] the band structure that results if we restrict the tight - binding hamiltonian to first neighbors ( top left ) , up to second nearest neighbors ( top right ) , up to third nearest neighbors ( bottom left ) , and without restriction ( bottom right ) .",
    "one can see that already the second neighbors model provides a good semiquantitative description of the band formation .      in the next figure  [ fig : qmobs ]",
    "we show the tight - binding band structures within the qmo model . in these calculations",
    "we have included the on - site trigonal splitting ( the top left panel ) , adding the nearest neighbors @xmath115 hopping ( top right ) , then the second nearest neighbors @xmath116 hopping ( bottom left ) and , finally , including also the third nearest neighbors hopping between the like orbital , which also proceeds through na and does not take an electron out of the corresponding qmo ( bottom right ) .",
    "the small dispersion that arises for nearest neighbors is due to deviations from the perfect octahedral environment of iridium . upon inclusion of second nearest neighbors ,",
    "as mentioned in the main text , the upper doublet and singlet merge to form one three - band manifold .      in figure",
    "[ projection ] , we show projections of the total density of states of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 onto the quasi - molecular orbitals specified in table  [ 1 ] of the main text.the eigenvector matrix @xmath117 ( with @xmath118 ) is a unitary transformation that rotates the atomic ir @xmath2 orbitals into the qmo orbital space . @xmath66 and @xmath62 states are perfectly degenerate in the nonrelativistic case ( figure  [ projection ] ( a ) ) .",
    "when spin - orbit coupling is turned on ( figure  [ projection ] ( b ) ) , interestingly , the three upper bands are no more equivalent in this sense , with the central band being mostly @xmath59 , and the other two mostly @xmath62 .",
    "importantly , there is hardly any mixing between the lower three bands and the upper three bands , emphasizing the fact that the low - energy physics is nearly exclusively defined by the upper three qmos , and their mutual interaction , whether with or without spin - orbit . at the same time",
    ", one can , alternatively , project the same bands onto the relativistic orbitals , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and , as observed before@xcite , the upper two bands have more @xmath119 character than @xmath120 character , but , for instance , at the @xmath121 point , only slightly so ( more at some other points ) .",
    "thus , even though the so effects are considerable , they are not strong enough to reduce the problem to a two @xmath119 model .",
    "the ferromagnetic state shows in the absence of so an energy gain of nearly 80 mev per ir with respect to the non - magnetic solution and about half this value against competing antiferromagnetic states ( zigzag and stripy phases ) ; the simple nel state is much higher in energy .",
    "inclusion of so changes the energetics considerably , as described in the main text , with the zigzag antiferromagnetic ordering becoming competitive with the ferromagnetic one , and lower in energy than the stripy phase .",
    "we deliberately do not discuss the calculated energies in detail , because the energy differences involved are on the order of one mev per atom , which is beyond the accuracy of the density functional theory itself , and on the border of the technical accuracy of existing band structure codes .        in fig .",
    "[ doss ] we show the density of states for some magnetic orderings considered in our fully relativistic calculations .",
    "note that the zigzag ordering preserves the nonmagnetic pseudogap at the fermi level , while the stripy ordering destroys it .",
    "finally some considerations about the hubbard @xmath21 are at place . in fact , there are two ways of defining @xmath21 in this case . as usually , the actual value of @xmath21 depends on which orbitals it is being applied to . for instance",
    ", it is well known that in fe pnictides the appropriate value of @xmath21 acting on the wannier functions combining fe @xmath14 and as @xmath46 states is more than twice smaller that that acting on actual atomic @xmath14 orbitals since the screening effects change depending on the basis of active states considered . in molecular solids , such as fullerides , the atomic value of @xmath21 often appears completely irrelevant , and the physically meaningful value of @xmath21 is the ( much smaller ) energy of coulomb repulsion of two electrons placed on two molecular orbitals . in the case of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 one has a choice of using an atomic @xmath122 1.5 - 2 ev , realizing that the results will be strongly affected by the fact that electrons are localized not on individual ions , but on individual qmos , or of constructing @xmath21 in the qmo basis . the former way is readily available in such formalisms as lda+u but it may be a poor choice for the description of a system based on quasi - molecular orbitals .",

    "<S> contrary to previous studies that classify na@xmath0iro@xmath1 as a realization of the heisenberg - kitaev model with dominant spin - orbit coupling , we show that this system represents a highly unusual case in which the electronic structure is dominated by the formation of quasi - molecular orbitals ( qmos ) , with substantial quenching of the orbital moments . </S>",
    "<S> the qmos consist of six atomic orbitals on an ir hexagon , but each ir atom belongs to three different qmos . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of such qmos in solids invokes very different physics compared to the models considered previously . employing density functional theory calculations and model considerations </S>",
    "<S> we find that both the insulating behavior and the experimentally observed zigzag antiferromagnetism in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 naturally follow from the qmo model .    </S>",
    "<S> high interest in the recently synthesized hexagonal iridates  @xcite is due to the hypothesis  @xcite that the electronic structure in these materials is dominated by the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction . in this case , the ir @xmath2 bands are most naturally described by relativistic atomic orbitals with the effective angular moment , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in this approximation , the splitting between the 3/2 and 1/2 states is larger than their dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the upper band @xmath5 is half filled and ir atoms can be described as localized ( @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 ) magnetic moments  @xcite with the exchange interaction strongly affected by so coupling . in particular , this picture leads to a very appealing framework known as heisenberg - kitaev model  @xcite , with highly nontrivial physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> however , experimental evidence for the @xmath9 scenario is lacking  @xcite .    in this letter , based on _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations and model considerations , we show that this picture does not apply to the actual na@xmath0iro@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , this system represents a highly unusual case where the formation of electronic structure is dominated by quasi - molecular orbitals ( qmos ) , which involve six ir atoms arranged in a hexagon . </S>",
    "<S> what distinguishes this picture from molecular solids is that there is no associated spatial clusterization , but each ir atom ( via its three @xmath2 orbitals ) participates in three different qmos , yet in the first approximation there is no inter - qmo hopping the thus formed bands are dispersionless .    </S>",
    "<S> such an electronic structure calls for a new approach . </S>",
    "<S> there is no known recipe for handling its magnetic properties , or adding coulomb correlations , for instance . </S>",
    "<S> while we will not present a complete theory of spin dynamics and correlations in the qmo framework , we will outline the general directions and most important questions , in the expectation that this will stimulate more theoretical and experimental work and eventually generate more insight . yet , the key observable features of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 : small magnetic moment , unusual zigzag antiferromagnetism , and mott - enhanced insulating behavior , are naturally consistent with the qmo framework .    </S>",
    "<S> the main crystallographic element of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 ( see si ) is an ir@xmath10 ( 5@xmath11 ) honeycomb layer with a na@xmath12 ion located at its center . </S>",
    "<S> each ir is surrounded by an o octahedron , squeezed along the cubic [ 111 ] ( hexagonal @xmath13 ) axis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , ir @xmath14-states are split into an upper @xmath15 doublet and a lower @xmath2 triplet . </S>",
    "<S> the [ 111 ] squeezing further splits the @xmath2 levels into a doublet and singlet ; initially this effect was neglected  @xcite , however , it was later included  @xcite ( and overestimated ) to explain the observed deviations from the heisenberg - kitaev model .    in the previous works , after identifying the @xmath16 splitting it was assumed that the energy scales are @xmath17 @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) @xmath18 @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the @xmath14-electron band width , @xmath23 the effective hopping parameter , @xmath19 the hund s rule coupling , @xmath20 the so parameter , and @xmath21 the on - site coulomb repulsion . in this limit , the electrons are localized and the system is a mott insulator . while @xmath20 @xmath24 0.4 - 0.5 ev for @xmath25 ions , the bandwidth for 5@xmath14 orbitals is 1.5 - 2 ev and @xmath26 ev , @xmath27 ev , reduced compared to typical @xmath28 ev and @xmath29 ev for @xmath30 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> many - body renormalization may narrow the bands by a factor @xmath31 however , given that in ir @xmath32 , it is unrealistic to expect a large renormalization . therefore , the usual starting point @xmath33 is not valid here , rather , the system is close to an itinerant regime . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 , one can not justify reducing the description of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 ( and possibly other iridates ) to an effective @xmath35 model , decoupled from the other @xmath36 states .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the first step ( usually skipped ) is to understand the non - relativistic band structure . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore performed dft calculations ( see si ) initially without so effects ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bandso ] , solid purple lines ) . inverting the band structure results ( see si ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained the corresponding tight - binding hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the leading channel ( by far ) is the nearest neighbor ( nn ) o - assisted hopping between unlike orbitals ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this was also correctly identified previously  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are three different types of nn ir - ir bonds ; for one ( we name it @xmath37 bond ) ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) this hopping is only allowed between @xmath38 and @xmath39 orbitals , for the next ( @xmath40 ) between @xmath39 and @xmath41 orbitals and for the third bond ( @xmath42 ) between @xmath41 and @xmath38 . in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> this hopping , @xmath43 ( the prime indicates that the hopping is @xmath44 o ) is about 270 mev . </S>",
    "<S> perturbatively , this term is proportional to @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for the o @xmath46 states . ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite pointed out another ( next nearest neighbors , nnn ) o - assisted term , which we find to be @xmath47 mev . </S>",
    "<S> jackeli and khalliulin  @xcite invoked another nn hopping process , between like orbitals pointing directly to each other . despite the short ir - ir distance , </S>",
    "<S> these matrix elements are surprisingly small , @xmath48 mev . </S>",
    "<S> finally , some authors  @xcite addressed the trigonal squeeze , which creates non - zero matrix elements between the same - site @xmath2 orbitals .    </S>",
    "<S> the main feature of the calculated non - relativistic band structure ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bandso ] ) is formation of a singly degenerate ( not counting spins ) band state at @xmath49 ev , a doubly degenerate one at @xmath50 ev , and a three - band manifold between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ev . this clear separation , of the order of 0.3 ev , can not be related to the trigonal squeeze , as this can only split the 6 @xmath2 bands ( there are two ir per cell ) into a doublet and quartet .    in order to understand this , we start with the dominant hopping , the nn o - assisted @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider an electron on a given ir site in a particular orbital state , say , @xmath53 the site has three nn neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , this electron can hop , with the amplitude @xmath54 to a neighboring state of @xmath39 symmetry , located at a particular nn site . from there </S>",
    "<S> , it can hop further into a @xmath41 state on the next site , and so on ( see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure2 ] and  [ qmo ] ) . at each site , </S>",
    "<S> the electron has only one bond along which it can hop . </S>",
    "<S> following the electron around , we see that after six hops it returns to the same state and site from where it started . _ </S>",
    "<S> this means that in the nn _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 _ approximation every electron is fully localized within 6 sites forming a hexagon . _ such a state could be called a molecular orbital , except that there are no spatially separated molecules on which electrons are localized . </S>",
    "<S> each ir belongs to three hexagons , and each ir - ir bond to two . </S>",
    "<S> thus , three different @xmath2 orbitals on each ir site belong to three different quasi - molecular  orbitals ( qmo ) and these qmos are fully localized in this approximation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ qmo ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> six qmos localized on a particular hexagon form six levels , listed in table  [ table ] , grouped into the lowest b@xmath55 singlet , the highest a@xmath56 singlet , and two doublets e@xmath56 and e@xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy separation between the lowest and the highest level is @xmath58 which is close to the calculated total non - relativistic @xmath2 band width .    </S>",
    "<S> [ c]l|l|lsymmetry & eigenenergy & eigenvector(s ) + @xmath59 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 + @xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 + ( twofold ) & & @xmath65 + @xmath66 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 + ( twofold ) & & @xmath69 + @xmath70 & @xmath71 & @xmath72    we now add the o - assisted nnn hopping @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> here there are several such paths . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dominant hopping takes advantage of the diffuse na @xmath74 orbital ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : structure2 ] ) , and is proportional to @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> it connects unlike nnn @xmath2 orbitals that belong to the same qmo , and therefore retains the complete localization of individual qmos . </S>",
    "<S> it does shift the energy levels though , as shown in table  [ table ] . </S>",
    "<S> the upper singlet and doublet get closer and the lower bands move apart providing the average energy separations of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78  ev among the calculated non - relativistic subbands ( at @xmath79 the upper two levels merge ; in reality , @xmath80 . given that the subband widths are 0.20.3 ev , obviously , the upper doublet and singlet merge to form one three - band manifold .    </S>",
    "<S> several effects contribute to the residual dispersion of the qmo subbands . </S>",
    "<S> the trigonal splitting plays a role , albeit smaller than often assumed : the trigonal hybridization is @xmath81 mev ( the splitting being @xmath82 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this may seem surprising , given the large distortion of the o octahedra , however , in triangular layers several factors of different signs contribute to @xmath83 and strong cancellations are not uncommon@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> trigonal splitting , combined with various nn and nnn hoppings not accounted for above , all of them on the order of 20 mev , trigger subband dispersions of 200300 mev ( see si for further discussion ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall now address the so interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding bands and density of states ( dos ) are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bandso ] . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest two subbands hardly exhibit any so effect , even though the spin - orbit parameter @xmath20 in ir is @xmath24 0.4 - 0.5 ev , larger than both the subband widths and subband separation . </S>",
    "<S> however , a simple calculation shows that not only are the orbital momentum matrix elements between the qmos on the same hexagon zero ( this follows from the quenching of the orbital momentum in the qmo states ) , but they also vanish between the like qmos , located at the neighboring hexagons , such as @xmath84 furthermore , at @xmath85 the matrix elements between the two lowest subbands , @xmath70 and @xmath86 vanish because of different parities ; away from the @xmath85 point the effect of so increases , in the first approximation , as @xmath87 , where * a * , </S>",
    "<S> * b * and * c * are the three vectors connecting the centers of the hexagons , as can be worked out by applying the @xmath88 operator to the corresponding qmos .    the situation becomes more complex in the upper manifold , where three bands , @xmath59 and two @xmath62 , come very close . </S>",
    "<S> even though the diagonal matrix elements , as well as nondiagonal elements at @xmath85 still vanish , the fact that @xmath59 and @xmath62 are nearly degenerate in energy induces a considerable so effect at all other * k*-points ( which grows linearly with @xmath89 as @xmath90 note that deviations from the minimal model ( @xmath91 ) and so coupling with the lower @xmath66 states also affect the bands at @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> we also remind that the orbital moment of the individual electronic states can only be finite if the qmos mix ( which is the case ) , and the direction of the orbital moment is different in different parts of the brillouin zone : along one of the three cardinal in - plane directions it is parallel to the cubic @xmath93 , along another to @xmath94 , @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> since the spin moment tends to be parallel to the orbital moment , so is competing with the hund s rule coupling and suppresses the tendency to magnetism .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss the effect of the hubbard correlations . </S>",
    "<S> it was initially conjectured that na@xmath0iro@xmath1 was a mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> this seems counterintuitive , since similar @xmath96 ru and rh compounds are correlated metals , and more diffuse 5@xmath14 orbitals have a smaller hubbard @xmath97 ev and stronger hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> it is hard to justify that this @xmath21 can drive a 5/6 filled band of a similar width into an insulating state . </S>",
    "<S> recently another , more logical concept has gained currency : on the lda level na@xmath0iro@xmath1 is a semimetal , barely missing being a semiconductor , and a small hubbard @xmath21 just helps to enhance the already ( spin - orbit driven ) existing gap . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in our calculations the minimal gap is @xmath988 mev , but the average direct gap is 150 mev , consistent with the optical absorption@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal direct ( optical ) gap is 50 mev , so it is plausible that it is somewhat enhanced by correlation effects .    in order to include the effect of an onsite hubbard @xmath21 in the qmo basis </S>",
    "<S> , a @xmath99 has to be applied to each qmo@xcite , with a residual coulomb repulsion between neighboring qmos , @xmath100 ( note that two qmos overlap on two sites ) . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we expect that the effect of the coulomb repulsion in our system is similar to that in a single - site two - orbital hubbard model at half filling ( the upper qmo band is half - filled ) and @xmath101 mev . in this case , since @xmath102 does not compete with one - electron hopping any more , one should expect that the gap will be enhanced by a considerable fraction of @xmath102 , which is consistent with the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> thus , hubbard correlations are of no qualitative importance , and only moderately enhance the existing gap .    </S>",
    "<S> since all electrons are fully delocalized over six sites , any model assuming localized spins ( whether heisenberg or kitaev ) is difficult to justify . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the qmos are not magnetically rigid objects and neighboring qmos overlap on 2 out of 6 sites , which makes a model with magnetic moments localized on qmos equally unsuitable  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we will consider therefore magnetism in the itinerant approach . in the non - relativistic case </S>",
    "<S> , the non - magnetic dos shows a high peak at @xmath103 due to @xmath62 and @xmath59 merging and rather flat band dispersion ( see fig .  [ bandso ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a system is unstable against ferromagnetism ( fm ) and the peak is easily split gaining exchange energy ( 1 @xmath104ir ) with little loss of kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting fm state is half - metallic ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dos ] ) ( see si ) .    turning on the so interaction has a drastic effect on magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> so competes with the hund s rule that favors all onsite orbitals to be collinear . </S>",
    "<S> the spin moment is then reduced from @xmath105 @xmath8 to @xmath106 @xmath8/ir for ferro- , and @xmath107 @xmath108/ir for the zigzag and stripe antiferromagnetic ( afm ) arrangements ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital moment is parallel to the spin one , reminiscent of the @xmath5 state , and is roughly equal in magnitude and not twice larger , as it should be for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy gain for the fm case drops to a few mev / ir  @xcite , and the zigzag pattern evolves as the most favorable afm state .    </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , two closely competing ground states emerge from the relativistic dft calculations : ferromagnetic and zigzag . in the context of an itinerant picture </S>",
    "<S> , we can argue as follows . </S>",
    "<S> so creates a pseudogap at the fermi level in the non - magnetic calculations ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bandso ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gains one - electron energy and any afm arrangement that destroys this pseudogap incurs a penalty . from the three </S>",
    "<S> considered afm states only zigzag preserves ( even slightly enhances ) the pseudogap ( see si ) . that gives this state an immediate energetical advantage and leads to the energy balance described above . </S>",
    "<S> two notes are in place : first , all the above holds in lda+u calculations with a reasonable atomic @xmath21 ( we have checked @xmath21 up to 3.8 ev ) . the role of @xmath21 in these systems - as stated previously- is merely enhancing the existing so - driven gap . </S>",
    "<S> second , if the dos indeed plays a decisive role in magnetic interactions , it is unlikely that they can be meaningfully mapped onto a short - range exchange model , heisenberg or otherwise .    summarizing , </S>",
    "<S> our dft calculations demonstrate that na@xmath0iro@xmath1 is close to an itinerant regime . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure of this system is naturally described on the basis of quasi - molecular orbitals centered each on its own hexagon . </S>",
    "<S> this makes this , and similar materials rather unique . </S>",
    "<S> proceeding from this description one can understand the main properties of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , including its unique zigzag magnetic ordering with small magnetic moment .    however , the main goal of our work is not a complete understanding of the magnetic properties of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we realize that this understanding is still incomplete and that full explanation of the weak antiferromagnetism , as well as of the magnetic response in this compound remains a challenge . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we lay out the framework in which this challenge has to be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that both the simplified ( but correct ) tb model proposed in previous studies  @xcite , and full _ ab initio _ calculations provide a framework that is best described by the quasi - molecular orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> this is an as yet unexplored concept ( as opposed to molecular orbitals or atomic orbitals ) , and there are many open questions about how to treat correlations , magnetic response _ etc . </S>",
    "<S> _ in this framework , however , it appears to be the only way to reduce the full 12 atomic orbitals ( @xmath2 or their relativitsic combinations ) problem to a smaller subspace ( 3@xmath109 ) qmos .    </S>",
