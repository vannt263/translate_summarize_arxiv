    "quantitative studies in linguistics have a long lineage . due to the extreme complexity of languages ,",
    "these studies have been mainly based on statistical properties of words in literary corpora .",
    "outstanding early examples of these studies are j. b. estoup ( 1916 ) , g. dewey ( 1923 ) and e. v. condon ( 1928 ) .",
    "however the most influential contribution on this topic is by g. k. zipf ( 1949 ) . in his work",
    "appears what is today known as _",
    "zipf s law _ which can be formulated as follows : let @xmath0 ; @xmath1 , be the relative frequency of the words in a text in decreasing order",
    ". then zipf s law states that :    @xmath2    in this case , the items are words taken from a given text , the most abundant word takes the first place ( @xmath3 ) , the second one takes the following place ( @xmath4 ) and so on .",
    "the fact that the mathematical expression of the law is a negative exponent power law implies that the law is a straight line with negative slope @xmath5 when plotted in log - log scales .",
    "@xmath6 is a proportionality constant with no phenomenological interest .",
    "this empirical law has found applications in a wide range of natural and human phenomena ( li , 2003 ) .",
    "the case when @xmath7 is of particular interest because it implies self - similarity .",
    "the exact mechanism behind zipf s law still remains a mystery so far .",
    "however it is important to remark that the presence of power laws implies in general that the underlying mechanism is neither stochastic or regular .",
    "power laws are the signature of correlated noise possibly associated to and `` edge of chaos '' dynamics ( ref ) or could be a clue to self - organized criticality ( bak et al , 1989 )    the main drawback of zipf s law was the bad fitting at very high and very low frequencies in the word counting problem .",
    "an improvement over the zipf s law was proposed by b. mandelbrot ( 1954 ) :    @xmath8^{1+\\epsilon}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the number of different words in the text and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are parameters to be adjusted .",
    "zip s law is a special case of mandelbrot s .",
    "this fact , along with a complete discussion of the role of power laws in the field of informetrics can be found in ( egghe , 2005 ) .    recently it has been reported ( le quan ; 2002 ) that what zipf found is valid for small corpora ( for the size of the text that were analyzable at that time ) , and that today that the computer allows the analysis of huge texts , the log - log plot shows a clear downwards bending tail instead of the predicted straight line .",
    "scientific productivity is another topic where the first studies date back almost a century with the works of a. dresden ( 1922 ) and a. j. lotka ( 1926 ) .",
    "the law of lotka has the same mathematical form of eq ( 1 ) but he already introduced bibliometric variables by using @xmath12 as contributors or authors of a given paper and @xmath0 as articles or papers themselves . since lotka , it is common to call  sources \" the independent variable and  item \" the dependent one .",
    "this way , lotka s law states that the number of items is a power law of the sources .",
    "the branch of informetrics related to the study of power laws is called _ lotkaian informetrics _ ( egghe , 2005 ) .",
    "informetrics mainly deals with the relationships between sources and items .",
    "it is normal to find the pairs authors - journals or journals - bibliographies as sources and items . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of extending the lotkaian informetrics to the realm of journal impact factors ( jifs ) .",
    "we show as well that the rank - order jifs plots deviate from a traditional lotkaian equation and propose an extension to what it could be called _ two - exponent lotkaian laws_.",
    "impact factor is a measure of the frequency with which the `` average article '' in a journal has been cited in a particular year or period ( garfield ; 1994 ) , it is calculated `` by dividing the number of times a journal has been cited by the number of articles it has published during some specific period of time .",
    "the journal impact factor will thus reflect an average citation rate per published article '' ( garfield ; 1955 ) .",
    "the impact factor of journals is an attempt to evaluate the knowledge production published among different journals of a given field .",
    "mainly covered by the _ science citation index _ database , it is published annually since 1975 in the _ journal citation reports_.    jifs has been the target of many criticisms ( soegler ; 1997 , frhlich , 1996 ) and there is a debate about its usage as a tool to evaluate research .",
    "even the influential journal _ nature _ states that the jifs figures should be handled carefully ( nature ; 2005 ) .",
    "regardless its pros and cons , the fact is that it is an every day measure of the importance of a journal and it is worlwide used ( de marchi and rocchi ; 2001 ) .",
    "while keeping a skeptical attitude towards the use of the jifs to evaluate scientific research , it should be recognized that it is an outcome of the process of publication and it has became by itself a subject of scientific study .",
    "rank - order distribution of jifs attracted the attention of d. lavalette who ( mentioned in popescu ( 2003 ) proposed the following law :    @xmath13^b\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the number of journals , @xmath12 is the ranking number , @xmath0 is the impact factor , @xmath14 is a parameter to be fitted .    in the next section",
    "we propose a law that outperforms lavalette s ( see concluding remarks ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the log - log plot of the if of a randomly taken field from popescu s database ( 2003 )    figure 1    it is evident that it is not a power law because of the bending tail in the right side of the plot .",
    "this fact motivated us to propose a beta - like function :    @xmath15    @xmath0 , @xmath16 represents the rank - order impact factors ; @xmath6 , @xmath17 and @xmath14 are three parameters to fit .",
    "@xmath6 is a meaningless scaling factor .",
    "notice that when @xmath18 this equation becomes lotka s law .",
    "for every set of data , we find the parameters values using a linear least squares method on the logarithmic variable :    @xmath19    table 1 shows the values of @xmath6 , @xmath14 and @xmath17 , as well as the coefficient of regression @xmath20 for impact factors of twelve disciplines . in figs 2 , 3 and 4 the impact factors data as well as our theoretical curve for the fields of physical , mathematical and environmental sciences are shown .",
    "we used semilog plots because they are more natural when the abscissa is a rank - order variable .",
    "table 1 .",
    "figures 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "we have shown the excellent agreement of the data with our model .",
    "the quality of the fitting is superior to the proposal of lavalette . from the comparison of eqs 3 and 4 ,",
    "it is evident that lavalette s law is a particular case of ours when @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to discuss the rationale behind lavalette s law because the original paper is not available and all we know about it is a mention in popescu s paper ( 2003 ) .",
    "the underlying proposed mechanism yielding the above discussed behaviors often assumes a kind of  biological evolution form \" .",
    "for instance , g. yule ( 1924 ) working in a model suggested by j. willis ( 1922 ) managed to prove that assuming a single ancestral specie and probabilities of mutation and duplication a power law behavior is obtained .",
    "expansion - modification systems proposed by w. li ( 1991 ) , which take into account the basic features of dna mutation processes ( r. mansilla and cocho , 2000 ) , are also able to predict this behaviour .",
    "when discussing journal impact factors , a balance between the importance to the researchers of publish their work in high ranked journal , the difficulties associated with doing this and the increase of impact received by journals with high impact factor , seems to create a  rich gets richer `` ( the ' ' matthew effect \" , see ( merton ; 1968 and egghe and rousseau ; 1999 ) mechanism also observed in complex networks ( barabasi , 2002 ) .",
    "more than 49 years ago , h. simon ( 1955 , 1957 ) proposed a model which produces similar distributions .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the bending of the tail of jifs rank - order distribution means that after a critical zone of jifs values is smooth thus discarding the possibility of the existence of multifractality .",
    "power - laws seem to be ubiquitous in physics , biology , geography , economics , linguistics , etcetera ( see li , w. , 2003 ) .",
    "we consider  linguistic studies \" not only those related with natural languages but also arbitrary languages over abstract finite alphabets .",
    "when the number of possible  words \" is large , as it is the case for natural languages , it is expected to have a good fitness with a one - parameter power law . however",
    ", when the number of words is rather small , as it is the case of programing languages , one - exponent power laws absolutely fails and more parameters are necessary for a suitable fit .",
    "new elements to this considerations have been given by lequan et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "they showed that there is a serious deviation when the size of the sample is huge .",
    "we expect that the increase in computing power will show that the deviation of zipf s and lotka s laws is a generic phenomenon",
    ". then , a two - exponent lotkaian and zipfian infometrics and linguistics should be welcome .",
