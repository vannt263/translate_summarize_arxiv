    "for many years it has been argued by kibble @xcite and others @xcite that the large - scale structure of the universe can be attributed to cosmic strings formed during a symmetry - breaking transition at the grand unification scale .",
    "unfortunately , given the unlikely event of observing a cosmic string ( vortex ) directly , chains of inference are sufficiently long that it is difficult , if not impossible , to make the case compelling .",
    "however , the formation of topological defects like vortices during symmetry - breaking phase transitions is not unique to the early universe but generic to many physical systems .",
    "in particular , recent experiments on the production of vortices in superfluid @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite have excited considerable interest .",
    "the suggestion that these , and other experiments @xcite , may provide an insight on the early universe have been made by the experimental groups concerned . in this",
    "they have been championed by some theoretical astroparticle physicists , most notably zurek @xcite whose most recent review article @xcite was , indeed , titled _ cosmological experiments in superfluids and superconductors_. nonetheless , despite the hard thinking that has already taken place , there is no doubt that a fuller understanding of the _ nonequilibrium _ dynamics of vortex production is required if comparisons are to be more than superficial analogies .    what encourages us in the hope that vortex production in the early universe and the laboratory has close parallels is that , in the first instance , the most plausible production mechanism refers to neither .",
    "we recapitulate it now for the simplest theory permitting vortices , that of a complex scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "the complex order parameter of the theory is @xmath3 and the theory possesses a global @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) symmetry that we take to be spontaneously broken at a phase transition .",
    "the field @xmath6 could be either a complex non - relativistic order field appropriate to a superfluid or a relativistic field in the early universe .",
    "the transition is continuous in both cases but , as we shall see , the details of the transition order are largely irrelevant to our conclusions , as long as it is not strongly first - order .    initially , we take the system to be in the symmetry - unbroken ( disordered ) phase .",
    "we have no reason to choose any particular initial field configuration , beyond the requirement that the field is distributed about @xmath7 with zero mean @xmath8 .",
    "the simplest assumption is that , beginning at some time @xmath9 , the @xmath4 symmetry of the ground - state ( vacuum ) is broken by a quench , a rapid change in the environment inducing an explicit time - dependence in the field parameters .",
    "once the quench is completed the @xmath6-field potential @xmath10 is taken to have the symmetry - broken form @xmath11 of the familiar ` wine - bottle ' bottom .",
    "the ground - state manifold ( the circle @xmath12 , labelled by the phase @xmath13 of @xmath14 ) is infinitely connected and the theory possesses _ global _ strings or vortices , labelled by a winding number @xmath15 .",
    "specific straight - string solutions to the classical field equations are well - known , both for the non - relativistic @xcite and the relativistic cases @xcite .",
    "the only property of these solutions that we need is that , as tubes of false vacuum , their thickness is the compton wavelength of the massive ( higgs ) excitations of the theory .",
    "these strings cost considerable energy to produce .",
    "that they should appear at all follows from a general argument , due to kibble @xcite , which goes as follows . during the transition , the complex scalar field begins to fall from the false ground - state into the true ground - state , choosing a point on the ground - state manifold at each point in space , subject to the constraint",
    "that it is continuous and single - valued . for continuous transitions ,",
    "for which this collapse to the true ground - state occurs by spinodal decomposition or phase separation , the resulting field configuration is expected to be one of domains within each of which the scalar field has relaxed to a constant ground - state value ( i.e. constant field magnitude and phase ) .",
    "if this is so , then the requirements of continuity and single valuedness will sometimes force the field to remain in the false ground - state between some of the domains .",
    "for example , the phase of the field may change by an integer multiple of @xmath16 on going round a loop in space .",
    "this requires at least one _ zero _ of the field within the loop , each of which has topological stability and characterises a vortex passing through the loop .",
    "the density of strings is then closely linked to the number of effective domains and the evolution of this density is , correspondingly , linked to the nature of the domain growth . when the phase transition is complete and there is no longer sufficient thermal energy available for the field to fluctuate into the false ground - state , the topological defects are frozen into the field .",
    "simple counting arguments suggest defect densities at this time of the order of one string passing through each correlation area . from then on ,",
    "the defect density alters almost entirely by interactions of defects amongst themselves , rather than by fluctuations in the fields @xcite , but such calculations go beyond the scope of this paper .    in an earlier paper @xcite , henceforth known as @xmath17 ,",
    "( but see also @xcite ) , two of us ( a.g and r.r ) showed how defects were produced in a very simple model of a _ relativistic _",
    "@xmath4 scalar field theory in which the long wavelength fluctuations that drove the transition were gaussian .",
    "the fluctuations were taken to be set in train by the implementation of a quench from a high temperature , above the transition , to a low temperature . despite its oversimplifications ,",
    "its main interest is that it provides a concrete example in which the scenario outlined above is , indeed , true and quantifiable .    with low temperature many - body theory in mind , in this paper",
    "we show , in the same @xmath4 model of gaussian fluctuations , how a density quench of a _",
    "nonrelativistic _ medium also leads to vortices .",
    "a priori , we might expect significant differences in the vortex production .",
    "the relativistic regime considered in @xmath17 was characterised by initial temperatures @xmath18 for all particle masses @xmath19 ( in units @xmath20 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "non - relativistic media are characterised by @xmath21 , to freeze out antiparticles , but with @xmath22 , the non - relativistic chemical potential .",
    "surprisingly , in our simple model we find no difference once a proper identification of mass parameters has been made . as it stands our model , being weakly coupled ( in effect , with zero - coupling for short times ) , is far too simple to mimic superfluid helium . equally , unless we are considering extremely weak couplings of the strength invoked in inflationary models , our approximation",
    "will only have limited applicability to hot quantum fields . however , in principle , if not yet in practice , we know how to incorporate stronger interactions within our approximation scheme .",
    "the identity of the weak - coupling models should be reflected in similarities in the more realistic stronger coupling counterparts . as a result , our main conclusion about the similarity of vortex production in the two energy extremes may have greater generality , even if the detailed results given here are too limited .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows . in @xmath17",
    "we considered the production of both @xmath23 monopoles and @xmath4 vortices . since monopoles are somewhat easier to manage we concentrated on them at the expense of vortices , for which we quoted only such properties as were needed .",
    "in the next section we repair this omission by showing the way _ vortex _ densities , and density correlations , can be inferred from field configuration probabilities through field correlation functions . as in @xmath17 , this summary is largely a recapitulation of some early work of halperin @xcite , modified to our purposes .",
    "one of the difficulties of making straightforward comparisons between early universe physics and many - body physics is the difference in formalism , a reflection of the freezing out of antiparticles in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "we evade this problem by showing how to incorporate both regimes in a common relativistic expression , in which the non - relativistic limit is obtained by tuning the chemical potential .",
    "this permits the relevant field correlation functions to be calculated in the same approximations as for the relativistic case .    in the final sections we use these field correlation functions as input for the vortex density functions as shown in section 2 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of some of the results , and consider their implications for numerical simulations . in particular , the kibble mechanism as presented above says nothing about the fraction of strings that is produced in small loops against the fraction of ` infinite ' string ( i.e. string that does not self - intersect ) .",
    "infinite string is necessary for the creation of large - scale structure in the early universe .",
    "we shall suggest that the fraction of string in small loops is substantial .",
    "consider an ensemble of systems evolving from a given disordered state or , more realistically , from one of a set of disordered states whose relative probabilities are known , to an ordered state as indicated above , producing @xmath4 vortices .",
    "if the phase change begins at time @xmath24 then , for @xmath25 , it is possible in principle to calculate the probability @xmath26 $ ] that the complex field @xmath27 takes the value @xmath28 at time @xmath29 . throughout",
    ", it will be convenient to decompose @xmath30 into real and imaginary parts as @xmath31 ( and @xmath6 accordingly ) .",
    "this is because we wish to track the field as it falls from the unstable ground - state hump at the centre of the potential to the ground - state manifold in cartesian field space .",
    "it is trivial to reconvert the real fields into complex fields ( and similarly for conjugate fields , as we need them ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath26 $ ] will be performed later in our simple model . for the moment , consider it given .",
    "the question is , how can we infer the string densities and the density correlations from @xmath26 $ ] ? that we can calculate them at all is a consequence of the fact , noted earlier , that the string core is a line of field zeroes .",
    "this is equally true for both relativistic and non - relativistic @xmath4 theories .",
    ", for example , for which different methods would be required . ] the zeroes of @xmath32 ( @xmath33=1,2 ) which define the vortex positions form either closed loops or the ` infinite ' string mentioned in the introduction . following halperin",

    "we shall only consider situations in which @xmath48 that is , we assume equal likelihood of a string or an antistring passing through an infinitesimal area .",
    "however , the line density correlation functions @xmath49 will be non - zero , and give information on the persistence length of strings .",

    "the coefficient of the @xmath54-function in ( [ rho ] ) is the jacobian of the transformation from line zeroes to field zeroes .",

    "then , in the same gaussian approximation , @xmath76 and @xmath77 can also be calculated in terms of @xmath72 and its derivatives , with rather more difficulty , as @xmath78 and @xmath79 in which @xmath80 we note that both the density @xmath59 and the correlation functions @xmath81 are independent of the scale of @xmath72 .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further details .    to understand what @xmath82 and @xmath83 measure ,",
    "suppose @xmath84 .",

    "normalise @xmath88 with respect to @xmath89 , as @xmath90 whence @xmath91 , etc .. the situation in which strings passing through adjacent faces of this lattice are oppositely oriented ( i.e. string - antistring ) then essentially corresponds to @xmath92 , a case of maximum anticorrelation . on the other hand , if there is equal likelihood of the next face containing a string or an antistring then @xmath93 . as for @xmath94 ,",
    "this takes the value @xmath95 if the string is guaranteed to continue in the same @xmath96-direction through the next lattice cell , and takes the value @xmath97 if it changes direction at intervals @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath77 itself can be isolated by observing that , if @xmath98 , then @xmath99 .",
    "thus a value @xmath100 is also a guarantee that the string changes direction every @xmath74 .",
    "as we shall see , the situation is more complicated , even in our simple model .",
    "nonetheless , we shall interpret strong _ anticorrelation _ in the diagonal @xmath101 ( and positive @xmath102 ) on scales @xmath103 as signifying a persistence length ( the typical length along the string before it has completely changed direction ) of @xmath74 .",
    "nothing that we have said so far discriminates between vortices in a relativistic or a non - relativistic medium .",
    "this distinction appears in the definition of @xmath104 , to which we now turn .",
    "in order to compare vortex formation in relativistic and non - relativistic media it is convenient to develop a single formalism that encompasses both . for simplicity we assume in each case that the system is initially in _ equilibrium _ in the disordered phase and that the transition to the ordered phase occurs as the result of a quench , a rapid change in the environment of the system .",
    "the interpolation between relativistic and non - relativistic regimes is then effected by introducing the chemical potential @xmath105 , coupled to the conserved charge @xmath106 arising from the @xmath4 symmetry . provided @xmath105 is small in comparison to a particle mass the introduction of such a potential will have little effect on a phase transition for the relativistic theory initiated by quenching the system from a high temperature @xmath107 to , effectively , zero temperature .",
    "however , on increasing @xmath105 prior to the transition it becomes more costly to produce antiparticles and , if the initial temperature @xmath107 is decreased to a value much less than @xmath105 , antiparticles are frozen out .",
    "the system is then one of non - relativistic particles at a temperature much less than the particle rest masses . in this nonrelativistic regime",
    "the transition is induced by a quench in @xmath105 itself or equivalently , since @xmath105 determines the density , by a density ( pressure ) quench .",

    "having established the role of the chemical potential in letting us interpolate between relativistic and non - relativistic regimes in the initial conditions , we are now in a position to determine the effect of these initial conditions on vortex production in a simple model of gaussian field fluctuations .",
    "we begin by recapitulating the methods adopted in @xmath17 for a relativistic regime , for which @xmath269 .",
    "we have already assumed that the initial conditions correspond to a disordered state in equilibrium for @xmath270 .",

    "we assume that interactions are sufficiently weak that , having established equilibrium , their effect on the gaussian distribution is small .    for @xmath272 , the system is forced to change .",
    "the simplest assumption , made in @xmath17 , was that , for @xmath25 , @xmath128 and @xmath123 could be taken as _ constant _ , an idealised quench in which @xmath128 changes sign to take the _ negative _ value @xmath273 _ immediately_. that is , the potential at the origin has been instantaneously inverted everywhere , breaking the global @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "given the initial high temperature @xmath274 , this can be thought of as a temperature quench .",
    "if @xmath275 is very _ weak _ then , for times @xmath276 , the @xmath6-field , falling down the hill away from the metastable vacuum , will not yet have experienced the upturn of the potential , before the point of inflection at @xmath277 .",
    "thus , for these small times , @xmath278 can also be set to zero , and @xmath46 $ ] is gaussian , as required .",
    "the onset of the phase transition at time @xmath279 is characterised by the instabilities of long wavelength fluctuations permitting the growth of correlations .",
    "although the initial value of @xmath280 over any volume is zero , we anticipate that the resulting phase separation or spinodal decomposition will lead to domains of constant @xmath280 phase , whose boundaries will trap vortices .",
    "we now turn to the case of non - relativistic vortex formation , cast in as similar a way as possible .",
    "the situation we have in mind is the following .",
    "consider a gas of non - relativistic bosons of mass @xmath19 in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath281 .",
    "the state is disordered .    by changing the density",
    "we then force @xmath282 to change sign , from @xmath283 to @xmath284 , as rapidly as possible . yet again , in this idealised model we suppose that this change is implemented instantaneously everywhere at time @xmath251 .",
    "this sets in motion a change to a superfluid phase , in which the @xmath4 particle symmetry is broken by the condensate .",
    "order is again established by the growth of long wavelength fluctuations in which domains form .",
    "these domains will trap vortices on their boundaries .",
    "so as to give a solvable gaussian theory , for which we can use the results of section 2 , we maintain our procrustean approach of @xmath17 and ignore interactions before and after the change in chemical potential .",

    "in addition to the gross vortex density ( [ nt ] ) we can calculate the density - density correlation functions @xmath389 of ( [ ddc ] ) , identical for both the relativistic plasma and the non - relativistic medium . these were not considered in @xmath17 .    yet",
    "again , as in the case of the density @xmath59 , the @xmath29-dependence of @xmath63 only occurs implicitly through @xmath375 .",
    "the simple analytic form of ( [ wg ] ) enables us to calculate @xmath76 and @xmath77 , up to exponentially small terms in @xmath347 , as @xmath390 < 0 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b(r;t ) & = & \\frac{2}{\\pi^{2}\\xi^{4}(t ) } \\frac{e^{-2r^{2}/\\xi^{2}(t)}}{(1 - e^{-2r^{2}/\\xi^{2}(t ) } ) } > 0 , \\label{corr1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whence the diagonal elements @xmath391 ( no summation ) are all _",
    "negative_. specifically , @xmath392 that is , we have _ anticorrelation _ of densities for parallel directions and positive @xmath77 for orthogonal ones .",
    "this is just the situation discussed in section 2 .",
    "it is useful to expand ( [ corr1 ] ) and ( [ corr2 ] ) for @xmath393 .",
    "on normalising by a factor of @xmath89 , @xmath33 and @xmath102 of ( [ abc ] ) are given by @xmath394 for @xmath395 there is exponential falloff but , from ( [ corr3 ] ) we see that , in units of @xmath396 , the anticorrelation is large .",
    "the discussion of section 2 is directly relevant .",
    "since strings with a long persistence length would imply _ positive _ parallel correlations , and weak orthogonal correlations , we can interpret these anticorrelations as a reflection of an increased string bendiness .",
    "although it is difficult to be precise , this suggests a significant amount of string in small loops .",
    "this is an important issue since , as we noted , early universe cosmology requires infinite string if string is to be the source of large - scale structure . in practice ,",
    "some is enough .",
    "there is another , indirect , way in which we can see the tendency for more string to be in small loops than we might have thought . in numerical simulations of string networks based in throwing down field phases at random , the rule of thumb for a _ regular _ domain structure in field phase",
    "is that a significant fraction of string , if not most , is infinite string @xcite .",
    "however , as we saw earlier in ( [ rms ] ) , we do not have a regular domain structure in our model but have domains with a large variance in their size @xmath397 .",
    "unfortunately , the domain structure that we have here is not yet appropriate for a direct comparison since , as well as the domain size , the field magnitude has a variance about @xmath398 .",
    "the work of guth and pi @xcite shows that this can be parametrised by an effective dispersion in @xmath29 in @xmath399 of @xmath400 .",
    "nonetheless , consider an idealised case in which domain growth stops instantaneously because of back - reaction at some time @xmath132 .",
    "the distribution of strings will then be as above for @xmath401 , while the field adjusts to the vacuum manifold , without changing phase , in each domain .",
    "we would expect some string - antistring annihilation to continue while this adjustment occurs , so that the @xmath59 calculated previously is an overestimate of the string density at the end of the transition .",
    "however , the domains will still be of varying size with variance plausibly given approximately by ( [ rms ] ) .",
    "although it has not been introduced along the lines above , the inclusion of domain variance in numerical simulation of string networks shows @xcite that , the greater the variance , the more string is in small loops . beyond observing that there seems to be some infinite string",
    ", we will say no more .",
    "all our results are for quenches that go from significantly above the transition to significantly below it .",
    "these give the _",
    "smallest _ value of @xmath402 possible and , plausibly , the best chance of producing infinite string .",
    "suppose the _",
    "state characterised by @xmath403 of ( [ s0 ] ) is very close to the transition . for relativistic theories this means starting from a temperature only just above the critical temperature . for a non - relativistic theory it corresponds to beginning from a density very close to the critical density . in either case",
    "it corresponds to taking @xmath243 suffficiently small that the inequalities ( [ lims ] ) can not be satisfied .",
    "some caution is required , since fluctuations are large near the transition and the semiclassical action @xmath403 of([s0 ] ) is unreliable . despite that , let us take it seriously and assume that it is possible to neglect @xmath243 in comparision to @xmath404 within the time interval @xmath405 .",
    "the overhang calculation of @xmath17 shows that there is some leeway .",
    "then , with @xmath406 in ( [ wc ] ) and ( [ wc ] ) no longer slowly varying , instead of ( [ wapp ] ) , we have @xmath407 up to irrelevant factors .",
    "there is now no peaking of the integrand in ( [ wapp5 ] ) at any preferential wave number , and hence no preferred length scale that can be identified as a typical domain size .",
    "this lack of domain structure , and the inapplicability of the kibble mechanism , is because of the enhanced long - wavelength fluctuations that come from being too close to the transition initially .",
    "we stress that this does not mean that there are no vortices , or even a small vortex density .",
    "@xmath67 of ( [ wapp5 ] ) can be integrated as @xmath408 for @xmath375 as before .",
    "a little algebra shows that the vortex density @xmath59 is @xmath409 one - third of its previous value in ( [ nt ] ) . for distances",
    "@xmath395 , @xmath67 now has power behaviour @xmath410 instead of the gaussian behaviour of ( [ wg2 ] ) . as before , there is anticorrelation with @xmath411 but , at large distances , the density - density correlation functions are very different , only showing power - behaviour in their fall - off .",
    "however , for @xmath412 their behaviour is very like that of ( [ corr3 ] ) . nonetheless ,",
    "if we interpret ( [ wapp5 ] ) as the limiting case of domain structure with maximum variance in size ( compatible with causality ) , the same numerical data quoted earlier @xcite , with due caveats , suggest even more string in small loops .",
    "finally , with superfluid films in mind , we can repeat the analysis in _ two _ space dimensions .",
    "instead of ( [ wg2 ] ) @xmath67 is given , when @xmath345 , by @xmath413 the integrand is strongly peaked at @xmath414 which , from our previous analysis , we interpret as the existence of domains , trapping @xmath4 monopoles ( vortex cross - sections ) on their boundaries .",
    "the domains are of varying size .",
    "if we isolate the gaussian saddle - point in ( [ wg6 ] ) as @xmath415 then the rms variation @xmath377 in domain size @xmath74 is larger than in three dimensions , as @xmath416 this is independent of the definition of @xmath74 , but if we take @xmath417 as before , then @xmath418 for @xmath395 .",
    "this is intermediate between ( [ wg6 ] ) and the gaussian behaviour of ( [ wg2 ] ) .",
    "yet again there is anticorrelation in the density - density correlation function @xmath419 , where @xmath82 is given in ( [ defa ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have shown how global o(2 ) vortices appear , at a quench from the ordered to disordered state , as a consequence of the growth of unstable gaussian long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "most importantly , in the light of discussions about the extent to which vortex production in low - temperature many - body systems simulates vortex production in the early universe , our model supports the analogy .",
    "we have shown how , with our simple assumptions , vortex production is _ identical _ in both a relativistic high - temperature quench , in which the initial state is characterised by @xmath18 , and in a non - relativistic density quench in which the initial state is described by @xmath21 ( to freeze out antiparticles ) with a chemical potential @xmath420 .",
    "all that is required is an appropriate translation of the parameters from the one case to the other .    in our simple model of gaussian fluctuations",
    "the resulting string configurations scale as a function of the correlation length @xmath421 , at about one vortex / correlation area .",
    "this is compatible with the kibble mechanism for vortex production on domain boundaries upon phase separation . for a weak coupling theory",
    "the domain cross - sections are significantly larger than a vortex cross - section at the largest times for which the approximations are valid .",
    "however , there is a large variance in their size , with @xmath397 . because of this there is more string in small loops than we might have anticipated .",
    "nonetheless , we expect some infinite string . we stress that our model can , at best , describe weak coupling systems for the short times",
    "while the domains are growing before the defects freeze out .",
    "this is unsatisfactory for most early universe applications and for low - temperature many - body systems .",
    "however , we know in principle @xcite how to include back - reaction ( still within the context of a gaussian approximation ) to slow down domain growth as the field fluctuations spread to the ground - state manifold .",
    "the identity of the weak - coupling results of the two regimes should survive to this case also , although it will probably lead to different conclusions from those above .",
    "further , there is no difficulty in principle of embedding these results in a frw metric , along the lines of @xcite .",

    "problems occur with complex time shifts , such as are encountered in thermal field theory , as roughly speaking we require @xmath447 .",

    "looking at these equations for any one negative time gives @xmath455 and we find the same relation if the etcr is imposed at any positive time .",

    "in some approaches using different definitions of the fields , e.g.  @xcite , these are not zero . trying the same ansatz as before",
