    "the first step in the time - series analysis is to determine whether a source is variable .",

    "we binned the _ swift _  data by stacking exposures , chronologically , up to a minimum of 4  ks , 3  ks , and 8  ks , rounded to the nearest ks , for pg  1247@xmath0267 , pg  1634@xmath0706 , and hs  1700@xmath06416 , respectively .",

    "the @xmath153 values and probabilities for the _ swift _  sources shown in table  [ tab : variability ] were computed based on their binned _ swift _  data .",
    "since the light curves of our sources are composed of data from different  observatories , flux uncertainties stemming from instrument cross calibrations may affect the measured variability properties .",

    "appear to be either non - variable ( pss  1326@xmath00743 ) or much less variable ( pss  0926@xmath03055 ) than the other two _ chandra _  sources that have two observations with _ chandra _",
    ", one with _ rosat _ , and one with _",

    "sources may thus appear more variable if these uncertainties are not properly taken into account .",
    "it underscores the importance of conducting any monitoring project in a uniform way with the same instrument in the same band in order to obtain the most reliable results .",
    "the relative uncertainties in the cross calibrations among the  observatories used in this work ( except for _ einstein / ipc _ ) are typically of the order of @xmath162% ( e.g. , kirsch et al .",
    "2005 ) . after adding , in quadrature , an uncertainty of 10% to the error bar on each flux value to account for these uncertainties ( following saez et al .",
    "2012 ) , the significance of the @xmath153 test drops below 90% for each of the _ swift _  sources and for pss  0926@xmath03055 .",
    "for the _ swift _  sources , this effect is mainly due to the fact that the s / n of their _ swift _  data are lower , on average , than those of the other  data and their sampling pattern is more complex , relying heavily on the shortest sampling timescales where uncertainties on the variability power are larger ; as discussed below , the variability amplitude increases with sampling timescale .    to overcome the sampling bias , and to allow a better comparison with the temporal patterns of the _ chandra _  sources",
    ", we computed the @xmath153 value for each _ swift _  source , including the additional cross - calibration uncertainties of 10% , and using a light curve composed of one data point per  observatory , where the fluxes from each observatory were averaged ( resulting in a substantial increase in the s / n of the _ swift _  data ) . as a result ,",
    "pg  1247@xmath0267 and hs  1700@xmath06416 are variable with @xmath163% confidence , whereas pg  1634@xmath0706 shows variability with @xmath163% confidence only when the first ( i.e. , _ einstein _ ) and last ( i.e. , _ swift _ ) data points are excluded .",
    "the removal of these two points was done in order to match , as closely as possible , the temporal sampling of the other _ swift _  and _ chandra _  sources , and due to the fact that the cross - calibration uncertainty of the _ einstein / ipc _ with respect to the other instruments we use has not yet been determined ( kirsch et al .",
    "in particular , the rest - frame time separations between the _ einstein _",
    "epoch and the _ rosat _ epoch ( i.e. , second epoch ) as well as between the mean epoch of the _ swift _  observations and the _ xmm - newton _  epoch ( i.e. , fifth epoch ) are a factor of @xmath164 larger than the average and median rest - frame time separations between adjacent epochs in all our sources .",
    "the light curve of pss  0926@xmath03055 is composed of three _ chandra _  epochs and one _ xmm - newton _  epoch , and the relative calibration uncertainties between _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  are considerably lower than 10% ( e.g. , snowden et al .",
    "we therefore maintain that small cross - calibration uncertainties do not warrant an artificial increase in the flux uncertainties for this source .",

    "( 2003 ) and allevato et al .",
    "the quantity @xmath166 is also prone to systematic effects and biases stemming from the duration of the monitoring and from the power - law slope of the agn power spectral density ( psd ) function .",
    "the _ intrinsic _ @xmath166 tends to increase with the monitoring duration ( e.g. , vagnetti et al .",
    "2011 ) due to the red - noise nature of the psd function , while the _ observed _ @xmath166 increases with steeper psd power - law slopes with respect to the intrinsic value due to power leakage from lower frequencies ( allevato et al .  2013 ) .",

    "@xmath347 of the  psd function is expected to decrease as @xmath338  increases , we would have expected much slower variations in our sources with respect to nearby agns .",
    "however , we do not detect such a trend in our sfs .",
    "in particular , based on fig .  [",
    "fig : sf_compare ] , we do not observe the strong dependence of the sf on luminosity as reported in vagnetti et al .",
    "( 2011 ; cf . their fig .",
    "10 ) , who find that the slope of the sf increases with increasing luminosity ; a dependence that is not observed for the psd function .",
    "as we explain above , high @xmath343  values may compensate for the reduced variability due to the increase in @xmath338  and contribute to more rapid variability as higher frequencies receive more power .",
    "in addition to the effects of the accretion rate , variable jet emission may contribute to the relatively rapid and significant  variability we observe in our luminous sources .",
    "although our selection of rqqs was intended to minimize such ` contamination ' , rqqs are not necessarily ` radio silent ' ( e.g. , kellermann et al .",
    "1994 ; barvainis et al .",
    "1996 ; falcke et al .  1996 ; blundell & beasley 1998 ; blundell et al .  2003 ) .",
    "however , we do not expect that the relatively weak  emission from the jets in rqqs can dominate the observed  variability ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2011 ) . in order to quantify , or constrain , the contribution of the jet to  variability in rqqs , and since the radio emission in rqqs may be largely due to star formation ( e.g. , padovani et al .",
    "2011 ) , future monitoring campaigns should perform near simultaneous  and radio observations of such sources across a wide luminosity range ( e.g. , barvainis et al .",
    "we present initial results from _ chandra _  and _ swift _  monitoring of a sample of seven luminous , rqqs at @xmath361 extending over @xmath341  d in the rest frame .",
    "our  observations are supported by archival  data and by simultaneous or nearly simultaneous optical - uv observations , allowing a qualitative investigation of quasar variability properties at the highest luminosities and redshifts .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "rqqs exhibit an excess in  variability , above the well - known amplitude - luminosity anticorrelation , almost independent of luminosity or redshift , at @xmath362  erg  s@xmath270 in the  kev band .",
    "we suggest that this excess is primarily due to the higher accretion rates at higher luminosities and redshifts .",
    "we find no direct evidence of evolution in the  variability of rqqs up to , but a firmer conclusion will require continued monitoring , especially of our _ chandra _  sources .",
    "3 .   our sources vary more on longer timescales than on shorter timescales , in agreement with agn behavior at lower luminosities or redshifts , and some exhibit significant variability on timescales as short as @xmath28  d in the rest frame .",
    "we find significant variations in the @xmath34  values of our _ swift _  sources , implying relative flux variations at a level up to a factor of @xmath363 , which are dominated by the  variations .",
    "we confirm earlier reports that the dispersion in the luminosity - corrected @xmath34  distribution of type  1 rqqs may be dominated by variability .",
    "5 .   except for hs  1700@xmath06416",
    ", we do not detect significant  spectral variations in our sources , even for corresponding flux variations of up to a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "we plan to continue this ongoing study using _ chandra _  in order to characterize better the  variability properties of our four sources at that currently have only four sparsely sampled  epochs .",
    "in particular , our aim is to quantify their variability timescales by means of sfs .",
    "we also plan to characterize better the temporal behavior of our three sources at @xmath29 using _",
    "swift_. our results will serve as a benchmark for future  variability studies of distant agns , e.g. , with the planned cdf - s 7  ms survey , or with _ erosita _ and its multiepoch , all - sky survey spanning @xmath364  yr .",
