    "star formation in the circumnuclear regions of galaxies and its connection with the existence of nuclear young stellar clusters and/or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has been the subject of many studies over the past several decades since early models invoking dynamical resonances in a rotating bar potential @xcite , bars within bars @xcite , and the direct feeding of agn due to stellar winds or cloud - cloud collisions in the vicinity of the nucleus @xcite . some models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that gas could flow inwards from the ring , creating a disk of gas that , if massive enough , would become unstable . under this scenario , a massive black hole in the nucleus",
    "could be fed triggering an agn @xcite .",
    "regarding star formation in nuclear rings , two scenarios have been proposed : the `` pop - corn '' @xcite and the `` pearls on a string '' @xcite .",
    "the `` pop - corn '' scenario assumes that the cold molecular gas is accumulated in a circumnuclear resonance ring .",
    "if massive enough , the ring becomes gravitational unstable , fragmenting in clumps and forming stellar clusters at random positions . on the other hand , in the  pearls - on - a - string \" scenario ,",
    "new stars are exclusively formed in the regions where the gas enters the ring ( i.e. the regions of maximum gas density ) .",
    "these young clusters evolve passively as they orbit along the ring , producing a string of aging clusters .",
    "independent on the formation mechanism of the stellar clusters , the role of these clusters as they move along the ring can be important .",
    "stellar winds and subsequent supernovae explosions can affect their surrounding interstellar medium , removing gas and halting subsequent star formation , as well as generating shocks that will reduce the angular momentum of the gas , that could eventually fall towards the center , feeding the agn and/or forming a nuclear star cluster .",
    "detailed multi - wavelength two - dimensional spectroscopic studies in nearby galaxies with the adequate spatial resolution ( @xmath210 pc , or less ) are needed to further investigate the evolutionary scenarios mentioned above .",
    "co interferometric maps ( pdbi ) have shown the presence of a wide range of molecular gas structures in the central kpc region of nearby galaxies with an agn @xcite . according to these studies ,",
    "most of the molecular gas is concentrated in the form of a circumnuclear ring of several hundreds pc to kpc size , while @xmath533% of the galaxies show the evidence for a direct gas fueling into the agn down to scales of @xmath250 pc @xcite .",
    "of particular importance ,",
    "the near - infrared ( near - ir ) bands allow the study of the multi - phase gas , from molecular ( h@xmath4 ) to shocked partially - ionized ( feii ) to highly ionized gas ( e.g. caviii ) , that can trace a number of different physical structures and mechanisms , from molecular gas reservoirs to agn outflows . in the near - ir , recent studies using integral field spectroscopy ( ifs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have been particularly useful to map the stellar and gas kinematics , as well the gas excitation and distribution of the different gas phases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in nearby seyfert galaxies , compact ( scales of few tens of parsecs ) molecular gas disks @xcite , streaming motions towards the nucleus ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ionized gas outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and young stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been mapped in the nuclear regions .",
    "in addition , studies of circumnuclear star - forming rings at hundred of pcs from the nucleus in nearby spirals @xcite have focused on establishing the reality of the proposed evolutionary scenarios for the star - forming rings , such as the `` pop - corn '' scenario @xcite and the  pearls - on - a - string \" scenario @xcite .",
    "all these previous studies have been focused on either nearby luminous seyfert galaxies where the output energy is dominated by the agn , or galaxies with luminous circumnuclear star - forming rings . here",
    "we perform a similar study for ngc4303 , a nearby galaxy with both a ( low - luminosity ) agn and a star - forming ring , and that has also a young massive cluster at the nucleus .",
    "in addition , multi - wavelength observations @xcite reveal a spiral of circumnuclear star - forming regions ( cnsfrs ) that can be traced all the way into the inner few parsecs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting it could be the feeding channel to the agn and nuclear star cluster .",
    "finally , a high - velocity nuclear outflow extending up to @xmath5120pc to the north - east of the nucleus has also been observed in optical line emission of [ oiii ] @xcite .",
    "ngc4303 is at a distance of 16.1  mpc @xcite , and is classified as a sb(rs)bc @xcite .",
    "it is abundant in cold molecular gas @xcite that shows the global distribution expected for the gas flow in a strong , large - scale bar , and the two - arm spiral structure in the inner kiloparsec can be explained by a density wave activated by the potential of that bar .    in this paper , we present near - infrared ifs of the inner 350 pc radius of ngc4303 , obtained with the integral field spectrograph sinfoni at the vlt in order to map the kinematics and excitation properties of the different phases of the interstellar medium in the circumnuclear region .",
    "it is the first time that such mapping is provided in the near - ir .",
    "this work is organized as follows : section  2 presents the observations and data reduction procedure , while in sec .",
    "3 , we present maps for emission - line flux distributions and ratios , as well as for the gas and stellar kinematics .",

    "5 presents the conclusions of this work .",
    "the observations were done using the near infrared spectrograph sinfoni of the vlt , during the period 82b ( february 2009 ) .",
    "the pointings were centered on the nucleus of the galaxy , covering a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath28``x8 '' per exposure , enlarged by dithering up to @xmath29.25``x9.25 '' , with a plate scale of 0.125x0.220 arcsec pixel@xmath10 .",
    "this corresponds to an average coverage of @xmath20.7x0.7kpc with a spatial sampling of @xmath210pc per spaxel .",
    "the data were taken in the j ( 1.10 - 1.35@xmath11 m ) , h ( 1.45 - 1.80@xmath11 m ) , and k",
    "( 1.97 - 2.44@xmath11 m ) bands with a total integration time of 2400s per band . in the same way",
    ", a set of photometric standard stars was observed to perform the telluric and flux calibration .",
    "we estimated the spatial resolution of our seeing - limited observations by fitting a 2d gaussian profile to a collapsed image of the standard stars . the spatial resolution ( fwhm ) measured for each band",
    "is @xmath21 `` , @xmath20.6 '' , and @xmath20.5 \" for j- , h- , and k - band , respectively , that correspond to 78pc , 47pc , and 39pc at the adopted distance of 16.1 mpc .",
    "the reduction and calibration processes were performed using the standard eso pipeline esorex ( version 3.8.3 ) , and our own idl routines .",
    "the usual corrections of dark , flat fielding , detector linearity , geometrical distortion , and wavelength calibration were applied to each object and sky frames , before subtracting the sky emission from each on - source frame .",
    "after each individual data cube was calibrated , we constructed a final data cube per band , taking the relative shifts in the dithering pattern into account .",
    "the calibration of each individual data cube was performed in two steps .",
    "firstly , we removed the telluric absorption from the spectra .",
    "we extracted the integrated spectrum of the corresponding standard star within an aperture of 3@xmath12 of the best 2d gaussian fit of a collapsed image .",
    "we normalized the spectrum by a black body profile at the t@xmath13 from the tycho-2 spectral type catalog @xcite , after removing the strongest absorption features of the stars .",
    "the result is a _",
    "sensitivity function _ that accounts for the telluric absorption .    secondly ,",
    "each data cube was flux calibrated .",
    "the spectrum of the standard star was converted from counts to physical units using the response curves of the 2mass filters @xcite , and the j , h , and k magnitudes from the 2mass catalog @xcite .",
    "we then obtained a conversion factor from counts to physical units .",
    "each individual data cube was then divided by its corresponding _ sensitivity function _ and multiplied by this conversion factor to obtain a full - calibrated data cube .",
    "the estimated uncertainty for the conversion factor is @xmath1415% for each band .",
    "after the data reduction procedure , we performed a spatial filtering of the data cubes using a butterworth bandpass filter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to remove noise from the observed cubes .",
    "the final signal to noise ratio ( @xmath15 ) in the continuum is in the range 310 for the j band with the smallest values observed close to the borders of the fov and the highest values at the nucleus , while for the h and k bands we get @xmath16 .",
    "the improvement of the @xmath15 by the spatial filtering ranges from 30 to 5% , from the borders of the fov to the nucleus for all bands , as obtained by calculating the ratios between the @xmath15 of the filtered cubes and those of the original ones . by comparing the continuum images for the original and filtered cubes",
    ", we concluded that the filtering procedure does not change the angular resolution of the data .",
    "the top - left panel of figure  [ large ] shows a large scale optical image of ngc  4303 in the r - band from @xcite . in the top - right panel",
    ", we show the j - band continuum image obtained from the sinfoni datacube for the inner @xmath17arcsec@xmath1 , where we label the nucleus ` n ' as well as several star - forming regions regions , in particular region ` a ' ( a bright circum - nuclear  emitting clump ) , for which the spectra are shown at the bottom panels . the spectra were obtained by integrating the fluxes within a circular aperture of radius 075 and normalized to the flux at 2.1  @xmath11 m .",
    "the two spectra show similar slopes , suggesting that the nuclear and extra - nuclear continuum emission have similar origins . on the other hand ,",

    "we present also a zoom of spectrum from position a showing the main emission lines : , @xmath18 m , ,  and .",
    "different phases of the interstellar medium can be traced in the near - ir by distinct emission lines : ionized ( traced by  and  lines ) , partially ionized / shocks (  lines ) and hot molecular gas ( h@xmath4 lines ) .",
    "we used the emission - line profile fitting ( profit ) routine @xcite to fit the line profiles with gaussians and constructed maps for the flux distributions , centroid velocities and velocity dispersions for each emission line .    in figure  [ fluxmaps ]",
    "we show the flux distributions for the @xmath18 m , , ,  and  emission lines .",
    "black in these maps represent masked locations , where the @xmath15 of the lines was not high enough to allow good fits , and regions where the lines were not detected .",
    "we masked regions with uncertainties in flux larger than 50% , but , for most locations , the uncertainties are smaller than 20% .",
    "the bottom - right panel shows the k - band continuum map .",
    "all emission lines present extended emission up to 4@xmath19 ( @xmath5 300pc ) , and the main feature of the flux distributions is a circum - nuclear ring with clumps of enhanced line emission with radius in the range @xmath52.53.2@xmath19 ( 200250pc ) .",
    "some differences are observed among the distinct emission lines : ( i ) while the  and  flux distributions present emission at the nucleus ,  is not detected there , while  is marginally detected ( @xmath20 ) ; ( ii ) along the ring , the hi and [ feii ] emission is strongest to the west ( including south - west ) , and at a region to the south - east , while the  emission is strongest mostly to the east ( including south - east and north - east ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     [ tab - pars ]      in order to better study the gas excitation , we constructed the /  vs. /  diagnostic diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ diagn ] .",
    "this diagram shows a big overlap of regions corresponding to sne and agn , as some excitation processes , like shocks and thermal heating are common to both agn and sn .",
    "the black dots correspond to all observed spaxels and are mostly located in the region of sne and/or agn , with some points covering part of the star - formation ( sf ) region .",
    "this behavior is typical of luminous star - forming infrared galaxies and interpreted as due to excitation by combined effects of the agn and stellar ionizing radiation plus shocks in agn outflows , stellar winds and supernovae explosions @xcite .    for the nucleus ,",
    "the line ratios are high and typical of agns , while for the brightest regions in the uv ( a to c ) in the cnsfr , that are the youngest ( see discussion below ) the line ratios are typical of star forming regions . the older star - forming regions in the cnsfr ( d to h ) are displaced towards the sne region , with regions g and h presenting the most extreme ratios , likely associated to sne explosions .",
    "the line ratios are thus compatible with an age difference between the east ( older ) and west ( younger ) side of the ring ( see sec .",
    "4.1.4 for further discussion ) .    .",
    "the limits corresponding to excitation by young stars ( sf ) , supernova remnants ( sne ) and agn are from @xcite . ]",
    "the star formation in the nuclear regions of early type spirals frequently occurs in ring - like structures with radius of 1 kpc or less .",
    "examples include galaxies with luminous agns in their centers as well as many others with a weak agn or star - forming nucleus @xcite .",
    "it is well established that bars in galaxies can drive large quantities of gas to the inner regions , accumulating into inner resonances , generating and maintaining subsequent star formation there @xcite .",
    "two scenarios have been considered so far to explain the star formation in circumnuclear rings : the  pop - corn \" @xcite and the  pearls on a string \" @xcite . as discussed in the introduction , in the  pop - corn \" scenario the stellar clusters form at random positions with no age sequence , while in the ",
    "pearls on a string \" scenario , the clusters are formed where the gas enter the rings and then age as they orbit the ring forming a string of aging clusters .",
    "some previous studies favor the  pearls - on - a - string \" scenario @xcite , in galaxies with evidence of gas inflow into the ring @xcite . however , there are also rings that appear to be a combination of the two scenarios @xcite",
    ". an h@xmath21 imaging survey of 22 galaxies with circumnuclear star - forming rings @xcite has shown that about half of the rings show azimuthal age gradients as expected in the  pearls - on - a - string \" scenario , while the other half show no age pattern , have a flat age distribution , or even a radial gradient .",
    "thus , the star formation in the ( circum)nuclear regions of galaxies is far from clear .    in order to investigate the best scenario for the circum - nuclear star formation in ngc4303 , we show in fig .",
    "[ cnsfr - plots ] the sequence of values of the eqw and @xmath12 for the ,  and  emission lines , as well as the corresponding /  and /for each cnsfr , labeled from a to h. the top panel shows a small decrease in eqw values for , consistent with a small decrease in age from a to h. for the velocity dispersion ( middle panel ) , no clear trend is observed for  and , while for the , the @xmath12 values show a small increase from regions a to h. this variation is also consistent with a small increase in age from regions a to h , as the presence of sns in older regions can increase the  velocity dispersion .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ cnsfr - plots ] show small positive gradients for both /  and /  line ratios between regions a and h , and can also be understood as due to an increase in age as shocks from supernovae contribute as an additional excitation source for the  and  as the regions age , while the evolution of massive stars away from the main sequence diminishes the amount of ionizing radiation , i.e. reducing the flux of .",
    "this relative age dating is in agreement with previous conclusions @xcite that identified the east uv knots as older ( @xmath21025 myr ) than the west knots ( @xmath22.57.5 myr ) , therefore suggesting an age offset in the star - forming ring .",
    "thus , relative age differences for the star - forming clumps are confirmed from independent tracers in the uv - optical and now the near - ir .",
    "however , although our measurements show a trend suggesting an age sequence along the ring ( increasing from a to h ) , the trend is small and present some ups and downs , being equally consistent just with regions to the east being older than regions to the west .",
    "for example , in the case of /  instead of a smooth gradient , the observed variation is more consistent with regions g and h being older than the regions a  f . we conclude that the data do not confirm the ",
    "pearls on a string \" scenario neither the `` pop - corn '' scenario , as there is also no evidence for a random distribution of ages",
    ". we can only be sure of an age asymmetry , with the youngest regions to the west and oldest regions to the east .",
    "one interesting new result that can be observed in figure [ fluxmaps ] is that the regions of strongest h@xmath4 emission in the ring are approximately anti - correlated with the regions of strongest  and  emission .",
    "while the latter coincide with the uv knots of recent star formation , the h@xmath4 knots are observed mostly in the east part of the ring , but not coincident with the bright  and  knot there . in previous results from our group ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we concluded that the temperature of the region where hot h@xmath4 is observed is @xmath52000k , and that the mechanism producing the hot h@xmath4 emission was thermal excitation as a result of heating either by x - rays from the agn or shocks from sn . in the ring",
    "the dominant mechanism should be shocks from sn , thus the eastern knots of h@xmath4 emission would be hot ( 2000k ) regions associated with fading sn , being older than the eastern knot of  and  emission",
    ". these regions would be hot enough to produce h@xmath4 but not to produce  and  emission ( requiring 10,00015,000k ) .",
    "our results can be compared with those for the cold molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry in the star formation along the ring appears to follow the distribution of cold molecular gas , dominated in mass and surface density by the western spiral and gas lane @xcite . at the resolution of the co observations ( 2@xmath19 ) , the large concentration of molecular gas in the spiral seems to be located just outside the cnsfr , suggesting therefore not a direct correspondence between the regions were the star formation is taking place now , and the regions with the highest molecular gas densities ( figure 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the east side of the ring appears to be forming very few stars now ( as judged from the  and uv emission ) , and is almost devoid of cold molecular gas , in particular the northeast region @xcite . on the other hand , this is one of the regions where there is enhanced emission from hot molecular gas .",
    "thus molecular gas seems to exist there , but is heated by local sn , as discussed in the previous paragraph . in summary , regarding the cold molecular gas distribution , while there is a similar distribution with the youngest star - forming regions globally around the ring , this does not seem to occur on scales of a few pcs .",
    "the cnsfr is made up of small flocculent spirals or filament - like structures breaking into star - forming clumps extending along large sectors ( @xmath5 300400pc ) of the ring ( see fig.hst ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as fragmentation of a gas disk due to gravitational instabilities @xcite .",
    "the fact that the range of estimated ages for the young star - forming regions in the south - west arc of the ring is very small , suggests that the fragmentation is taking place quasi - simultaneously ( i.e. in less than few myr ) over sectors extending by hundred of parsecs .",
    "in addition , the east side of the ring appears to have formed stars some 1015 myr before the west side .",
    "again the lack of an obvious age gradient , suggest that the star formation was essentially simultaneous over a large sector of the ring .",
    "in addition , if the ring is rotating around the nucleus as indicated by our stellar and gas kinematic maps  which imply a rotational period of about 10myr , a possible scenario is that the oldest stellar clusters were formed in the west side of the ring , but , after 10myr have already almost completed one turn and are now observed in the south - east part of the ring .",

    "the star formation in the cnsfr of ngc4303 appears to be instead episodic with stars forming quasi - simultaneously over a large sector of the ring ( covering @xmath2300pc along the ring ) , aging as they rotate with an orbital time of several myr ; * assuming the star - forming regions in the cnsfr are closer to instantaneous bursts with ages of about 4  myr , we derive masses for the clusters in the range 0.3 - 1.5@xmath62m@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding masses for the associated ionized and hot molecular gas are about @xmath63  m@xmath7 and @xmath64  m@xmath7 , respectively . for stellar populations with older ages of up to 10 myr ,",
    "the corresponding stellar masses will increase by up to factor of hundred ; * the  emission shows an elongation to @xmath5120pc north - east of the nucleus that could be associated with the previously known optical ( [ oiii ] ) outflow ; * the  emission shows an elongation to @xmath5120pc west of the nucleus that could be the hot counterpart of the already known cold molecular gas  bridge \" that connects the nucleus with the large circumnuclear molecular gas reservoir ; * the near - ir emission - line ratios ( /  and / ) of the nucleus are consistent with the presence of an agn and/or a sne - dominated star - forming region .",
    "since there is no evidence for an aged stellar cluster in the nucleus , the line ratios are interpreted as due to the combined effect of x - ray radiation and shocks at the base of the ionization cone of the agn .",
    "higher angular resolution spectroscopy is required to further explore this scenario ; * the stellar velocity field is well reproduced by a model of a rotating disk with an inclination @xmath47 relative to the plane of the sky , major axis oriented along pa@xmath65 , and with a velocity amplitude of about 160 .",
    "the stars associated to the cnsfr show smaller velocity dispersion than the surroundings , revealing a cooler dynamical stellar population in the ring , consistent with their recent formation from cold gas ; * the gas velocity fields are also dominated by rotation , similar to that observed for the stars but with a larger amplitude .",
    "a significant deviation from rotation was observed for the  emission in a region extending @xmath5120pc to the south - west , along the orientation of the nuclear bar .",
    "a higher  velocity dispersion is also observed at this location and is attributed to the presence of more than one kinematic component associated with non - circular motions along the nuclear bar .",
    "all fits files for the emission - line flux distributions , velocity fields and velocity dispersion maps are available online as supplementary material .",
