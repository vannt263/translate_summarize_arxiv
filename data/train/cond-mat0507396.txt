    "the past decade has seen a rapid growth of interest in the study of hybrid superconductor - ferromagnet ( sf ) structures ( see , for example , reviews ) .",
    "the interest in such systems originates from the possibility of finding new physical phenomena as well from the hope of constructing new devices based on these structures .",
    "new physical phenomena arising in these systems are the result of a nontrivial interplay of competing types of ordering in superconductors and ferromagnets .",
    "superconducting correlations lead in superconductors to the appearance of the cooper pairs , that is , the pairs of electrons with opposite spins . on the opposite",
    ", the exchange interaction in ferromagnets tries to align the electron spins in one direction .",
    "in sf structures these two types of interactions are spatially separated and can coexist despite much greater value of the exchange energy @xmath2 in comparison to the superconducting order parameter @xmath3 .    due to the proximity effect @xcite the superconducting correlations",
    "penetrate the ferromagnet in sf structures .",
    "the opposite effect , i.e. , the penetration of a magnetic moment @xmath4 into the superconductor , also takes place .",
    "it turns out that the magnetic moment @xmath5 is induced in the superconductor .",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath5 is aligned in the direction opposite to the magnetization direction of free electrons in the ferromagnet and spreads over a distance of the order of the superconducting correlation length @xmath6 ( in the dirty limit ) .",
    "@xcite on the other hand the condensate wave function @xmath7 penetrates the ferromagnet with an uniform magnetization @xmath8 over a much shorter distance of the order of the `` exchange length '' @xmath9.@xcite the condensate wave function decays in f in a nonmonotonic way as @xmath10 ; it oscillates in space and decreases exponentially .",
    "this nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath11 leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of the critical temperature @xmath12 of the superconducting transition in sf bilayers and multilayers@xcite and to a @xmath13-state in sfs josephson junctions.@xcite    in the case of a nonuniform magnetization in the ferromagnet a new phenomenon appears : a triplet component of the condensate wave function @xmath7 ( generally speaking the condensate wave function is a matrix in the particle - hole and spin space ) arises in the sf system.@xcite this triplet component is an odd function of the matsubara frequency @xmath14 ( while the conventional bcs singlet component of @xmath7 is an even function of @xmath14 ) and spreads in the ferromagnet over a long distance of the order of @xmath15 .",
    "this long - range triplet odd - frequency component was predicted to exist in a sf structure with nonhomogeneous magnetization in ref .   and",
    "this prediction was confirmed for a slightly different case in ref .  .",
    "in refs .   and  , a sf structure with a domain wall at the sf interface was considered , that is , it was assumed that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 in the interval @xmath18 and @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "the triplet component @xmath21 was shown to arise in the domain wall and to penetrate the ferromagnet over a long distance @xmath1 .",
    "unlike the triplet component in superfluid @xmath22he and in sr@xmath23ruo@xmath24 , this odd triplet component corresponds to _ s_-wave correlations and hence is symmetric in the momentum space ; therefore it is not destroyed by scattering on ordinary , nonmagnetic impurities , and survives in the dirty limit .",
    "we call this component the long - range triplet component ( lrtc )",
    ". the lrtc may also arise in a sf structure with a uniform magnetization and spin - active interface.@xcite note that from a macroscopic point of view a domain wall at the sf interface can also be considered as a `` spin - active interface '' .",
    "the lrtc may arise in a multilayered sf structure with noncollinear orientations of the magnetization vector @xmath25 in different f@xmath26 layers.@xcite in particular , a new type of superconductivity ( odd triplet superconductivity ) has been predicted in such structures if the thickness of the f layers @xmath27 obeys the condition : @xmath28 . in this case the josephson coupling between neighboring f layers is realized only via the lrtc because the singlet component decays very fast in the f layers",
    ". therefore superconductivity in the transverse direction is due to the lrtc , whereas in - plane superconductivity is caused mainly by the singlet bcs component .",
    "the influence of the lrtc on the critical temperature of the superconducting transition in fsf structures with a noncollinear magnetization orientation was studied in ref .  .",
    "historically , the odd - frequency triplet pairing was conjectured in 1974 by berezinsii@xcite as a possible mechanism for superfluidity in @xmath22he .",
    "it turned out later that in @xmath22he another type of triplet pairing ( even in frequency , odd in momentum ) is realized .",
    "odd - frequency pairing in solids was also studied in refs .  .",
    "a triplet odd - frequency pairing was investigated in refs .",
    "( two - dimensional electron gas with repulsion in the presence of impurities ) and ( a kondo lattice model ) .",
    "a singlet odd - frequency pairing was analyzed@xcite as a possible type of pairing in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "although several experimental results may be interpreted in terms of the lrtc,@xcite there are still no direct experimental evidences in favor of the odd triplet superconductivity .",
    "therefore there is a need to investigate , in more detail , a possibility to observe this new type of superconductivity .",
    "one of the important and inherent features of ferromagnets is the domain structure .",
    "the domain structure in a ferromagnet may essentially alter the properties of sf structures .",

    "the magnetization vector is assumed to be in - plane and to rotate around the direction normal to the plane of the junction . in this case",
    "the lrtc arises , and the possible @xmath13-state may be suppressed due to an effective averaging of the exchange field . in ref .",

    "the dos variation is a strongly coordinate - dependent quantity since the lrtc arises near the domain walls .",

    "although the amplitude of the lrtc is less than the amplitude of the singlet component in the f film at the interface by @xmath218 times , it decays much more slowly in the f film ( here the characteristic value of the wave vector @xmath87 is of the order @xmath1 or @xmath219 ) . therefore if the thickness of the f film @xmath27 is much larger than the `` exchange '' length @xmath220 , which characterizes the decay of the singlet component in the ferromagnet , only the lrtc @xmath7 survives at the outer surface of the f film in a sf structure .",
    "its spatial in - plane dependence in domains @xmath221 differs drastically from the corresponding dependence of the singlet component near the sf interface .",
    "if the vector @xmath155 rotates in the nel walls in the same direction ( positive chirality ) , then @xmath7 turns to zero in the centers of domains .",
    "this implies that the dos variation due to the proximity effect @xmath222 varies inside a domain turning to zero in the middle .",
    "thus the measurements of the dos variation at the outer surface of the f film in sf bilayers allows one to get an information on the nature of the condensate in the ferromagnetic films ( singlet or triplet ) .",
    "the effects of the lrtc are mostly pronounced at the boundaries between domains and domain walls . however , the correction to the dos that we find is small since we assume the sf interface of low transparency and hence a weak proximity effect . at the same time , as we increase the interface transparency and reach the limit of applicability of our approximation , the correction to the dos falls into experimentally measurable range , while we expect that our results are still qualitatively valid .",
    "another way to increase the correction to the dos is to measure it at smaller energies .",
    "the obtained results provide an insight for the josephson effect in sfs junctions with multidomain structure in the f layer .",
