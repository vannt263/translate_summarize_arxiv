    "in our previous paper @xcite ( cited below as i ) we carried out an accurate detailed study of the ground state @xmath8 of the molecular ion @xmath5 placed in a constant uniform magnetic field ranging from zero up to @xmath9 for all inclinations @xmath10 . the goal of that study was to investigate the domain of existence of the @xmath5 ion .",
    "we showed that for all magnetic fields studied the molecular ion @xmath5 exists for moderate ( not very large ) deviations of the molecular axis from the magnetic field direction ( moderate inclinations ) .",
    "furthermore it was found that for each magnetic field the most stable configuration of minimum total energy corresponded to zero inclination , where the molecular axis coincides with magnetic field direction .",
    "we called this configuration the ` parallel configuration ' . to this configuration",
    "the standard spectroscopic notation @xmath0 can be assigned .",
    "a major feature of this configuration is that with magnetic field growth the system becomes more and more bound ( binding energy grows ) and more and more compact ( equilibrium distance decreases ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to continue the study initiated in i and to explore several low - lying excited states . at",
    "first we re - examine the ground state for the parallel configuration @xmath0 in the region @xmath11 .",
    "a detailed study of the @xmath1 state which is anti - bonding without a magnetic field is presented . then the lowest states of different magnetic quantum numbers are investigated as well as the @xmath2 state .",
    "atomic units are used throughout ( @xmath12=@xmath13=@xmath14=1 ) , although energies are expressed in rydbergs ( ry ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath15 is given in a.u . with @xmath16 .",
    ", although sometimes another convention is used @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in making a comparison of the high accuracy results obtained by different authors especially for high magnetic fields this fact should be taken into account ]",
    "the hamiltonian which describes two infinitely heavy protons and one electron placed in a uniform constant magnetic field directed along the @xmath18axis , @xmath19 is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath20 ( see fig.1 for notations ) , where @xmath21 is the momentum , @xmath22 is a vector potential which corresponds to the magnetic field @xmath23 and is chosen in the symmetric gauge to be @xmath24 hence the total energy @xmath25 of @xmath5 is defined as the total electronic energy plus the coulomb energy of proton repulsion . in turn , the binding energy is defined as an affinity to having the electron as well as both protons being infinitely separated , @xmath26 .",
    "the dissociation energy is defined as an affinity to having one proton at infinity , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the total energy of the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field @xmath15 .",
    "spin degrees of freedom can be separated out and their analysis is straightforward .",
    "the problem is characterized by two integrals of motion : ( i ) angular momentum projection on the magnetic field direction ( @xmath29-direction ) and ( ii ) spatial parity @xmath30 .",
    "sometimes the parity @xmath31 corresponding to interchange of charged centers @xmath32 is used , which is connected with the magnetic quantum number and spatial parity ,",
    "@xmath33 if the case @xmath34 is even , both parities coincide , @xmath35 .",
    "thus , any eigenstate has two definite quantum numbers : the magnetic quantum number @xmath34 and the parity @xmath30 with respect @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the space of eigenstates is split into subspaces ( sectors ) each of them is characterized by definite @xmath34 and @xmath31 .",
    "notation for the state we are going to use is based on the following convention : the first number corresponds to the number of excitation - `` principal quantum number '' , e.g. the number 1 is assigned to the ground state , then a greek letter @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38 , respectively , with subscript @xmath39 ( gerade / ungerade ) describing positive / negative parity with respect @xmath36 .",
    "most of the excited states we study are the lowest states ( of the type of the ground state ) of the sectors with different magnetic quantum numbers @xmath34 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is quite obvious from the physical point of view that the ground states of the sectors with @xmath40 always have larger total energies than those with @xmath41 .",
    "therefore we restrict our consideration to the states with @xmath38 .",
    "conservation of the @xmath29-component of the angular momentum assumes the wave function of the electron ( in cylindrical coordinates @xmath42 ) can be taken in the representation : @xmath43 where @xmath34 is magnetic quantum number .",
    "let us gauge rotate the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the gauge rotated momentum ( covariant momentum ) .",
    "the constant term @xmath46 describes the linear zeeman effect splitting .",
    "it can be absorbed to a definition of total energy .",
    "the representation ( [ ham_m ] ) is rather convenient since each hamiltonian for fixed @xmath34 describes the family of eigenstates with quantum number @xmath34 and can be treated independently of the states with @xmath47 different from @xmath34 . now",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham_m ] ) has only the invariance corresponding to the spatial parity conservation .",
    "we are going to use the variational method in a way similar to what was done in i. the recipe of choice of trial function is based on physical arguments and is described in full generality in @xcite ( see for details the article i ) .",
    "eventually , the ground state trial function for fixed @xmath34 and @xmath31 is chosen in a form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 as well as @xmath53 are variational parameters , which are certainly different for different @xmath34 .",
    "s should be kept fixed .",
    "usually , we put @xmath54 the functions @xmath55 carry a certain physical meaning",
    ". they describe coherent ( incoherent ) interaction of the electron with the protons as well as their non - linear interpolation , respectively .",
    "calculations were performed using the minimization package minuit from cern - lib .",
    "numerical integrations were carried out with a relative accuracy of @xmath56 by use of the adaptive nag - lib ( d01fcf ) routine .",
    "all calculations were performed on dual pc pentium-4 , with two processors of @xmath57 ghz each .",
    "every particular calculation of given eigenstate at fixed magnetic field including minimization has taken in total about an hour of cpu time . however , when the variational parameters are found it take a few seconds of cpu time to calculate the variational energy .",
    "it is necessary to mention two technical difficulties we encountered .",
    "calculation of two - dimensional integrals with high accuracy which appeared in the problem has required a development of a very sophisticated numerical technique .",
    "we created a ` dynamical partitioning ' of the domain of integration , which depend on values of variational parameters similar to what was done in i. the domain partitioning was changed with a change of the parameters . sometimes the number of sub - domains was around 50 .",
    "another technical problem is related with very complicated profile of variational energy as the function of variational parameters which is characterized by many local minima , saddle points and valleys .",
    "localization of the global minimum numerically of such a complicated function with high accuracy is difficult technical problem which becomes even more difficult in the case of ten or more variational parameters .",
    "examining the physical relevance of trial functions allows one to avoid spurious minima .",
    "the parameters obtained in ( [ anzatz ] ) at every step of minimization were always examined from the physical point of view .",
    "such considerations are always something of an art .",
    "the @xmath58 subspace consists of two subspaces , @xmath59 ( even states ) and @xmath60 ( odd states ) .",
    "the state @xmath8 was thoroughly investigated in the paper i for the whole range of inclinations @xmath62 ( for settings see below fig.2 ) . at @xmath63",
    "this state becomes the state @xmath0 and our variational anzatz @xmath64 ( [ anzatz ] ) describing this state depends on ten parameters . as was mentioned above",
    ", the search for the global minimum numerically with high accuracy in the case of so many variational parameters is a difficult technical task .",
    "although this state was thoroughly studied in @xcite we decided to repeat the calculations using a more sophisticated strategy for localizing the minimum .",
    "the essential new element of the strategy was to impose an extra ( natural ) condition that the variational parameters change smoothly with @xmath15 .",
    "finally , it led to an improvement of the results in comparison to i and to previous calculations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this recalculation is very important for calculation of the excited @xmath2 state , where the orthogonality condition on trial functions must be imposed , @xmath65 .",
    "it is evident that an intrinsic inaccuracy in @xmath64 due to the approximate nature of the trial function ( [ anzatz ] ) as a function of @xmath66 is a source of inaccuracy in the energy of the @xmath67 state .",
    "thus , a reduction of this inaccuracy requires knowledge of the function @xmath64 as accurately as possible .",
    "the above - mentioned strategy allowed us to improve our previous results reported in @xcite on total and binding energies ( see table i ) and also on lowest rotational - vibrational energies ( see table ii ) .",
    "qualitative conclusions obtained in @xcite remain unchanged .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have carried out an accurate , non - relativistic calculation in the born - oppenheimer approximation for the low - lying states of the @xmath5 molecular ion in the parallel configuration at equilibrium in the framework of a unique computational approach . the @xmath1 state is considered in full generality for all inclinations of the molecular axis vs. magnetic field direction .",
    "we studied constant uniform magnetic fields ranging from @xmath68 up to @xmath69 , where non - relativistic considerations hold , although our method can be naturally applied to study the domain @xmath70 .",
    "we used a variational method with a very simple trial function with a few variational parameters inspired by the underlying physics of the problem .",
    "thus our trial function can be easily analyzed and in contrast to other approaches our results can be easily reproduced .",
    "the trial function ( 3 ) can be easily modified to explore other excited states .",
    "the present study of several low - lying excited states complements a study of the ground state performed in i. usually the total , binding , dissociation and transition energies grow with increase in the magnetic field , reaching values of several hundred ev at magnetic fields of @xmath71 g .",
    "these results can be used to construct a model of the atmosphere of an isolated neutron star 1e1207.4 - 5209 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this will be done elsewhere .",
