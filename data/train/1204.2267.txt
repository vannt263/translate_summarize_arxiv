    "since its inception three decades ago , quantum computing ( qc ) has developed energetically and spurred incessant innovation , uniting researchers from various areas of physics .",
    "@xcite one area that has witnessed steady progress in recent years has been quantum control of systems at the nanometer scale , where state of the art experiments have made manipulation of two - level quantum - mechanical systems a reality . at the same time , in addition to accurate and reliable control , a quantum computer requires scalability and long coherence times .",
    "this requirement has highlighted solid - state spin systems as a natural choice for quantum bits ( qubits).@xcite within this area , si has been known for its extraordinarily long coherence times , @xcite thanks to the absence of piezoelectric electron - phonon coupling , @xcite weak spin - orbit coupling @xcite , and nuclear - spin free isotopes , allowing removal of the hyperfine interaction by isotopic purification .",
    "@xcite as a result , si spin qc has emerged as an active subfield of modern condensed matter physics .",
    "outstanding experimental progress in si spin qc has been reported in the last few years in si quantum dots ( qds ) , @xcite and in donor - based architectures .",
    "@xcite theoretical research on si qds has also evolved at a brisk pace .",
    "@xcite concomitantly , qds in other group iv elements are being explored for qc : carbon , @xcite including nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond , @xcite and ge .",
    "@xcite    group iv materials ( c , si , ge ) are notable for having equivalent conduction band minima known as valleys . in low - dimensional si nanostructures",
    "typically the two low - lying valleys perpendicular to the interface are important .",
    "the valley degree of freedom , investigated many years ago , @xcite has received renewed attention in the context of qc . the multiplicity of the hilbert space brought about by the existence of equivalent valleys has been shown to hamper _ spin _ qc .",
    "@xcite at the same time , the interface potential gives rise to a valley - orbit coupling , which has been studied extensively in recent years , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically .",
    "@xcite    addressing specific valley eigenstates is a profound , challenging and unresolved problem . despite apparent similarities ,",
    "valley physics is significantly different from spin-@xmath0 physics , and a pseudospin picture of valley physics is of limited utility .",
    "firstly , no overall conservation law exists for valley composition as for spin .",
    "secondly , a comparison of valley - orbit coupling and spin - orbit coupling sheds additional light on this distinction . in the absence of spin - orbit interactions",
    "the one - electron wave - function factorizes into an orbital part and a spin part , whereas no such separation exists for the valley degree of freedom . unlike the spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "the valley - orbit coupling can not be viewed as a wave vector - dependent effective zeeman field that can tune valley dynamics . finally , even if the valley splitting is large enough to be resolved , no clear unambiguous signature of individual valleys exists .",
    "a _ smoking - gun _ experiment to identify valley - split states is an ambitious target , and several checks must be made on sets of quantum mechanical states to prove that they are indeed valley - split pairs .",
    "for example , for one electron in a single qd it was shown that relaxation between different valley eigenstates proceeds on longer time scales .",
    "@xcite for two electrons in a single qd the ground state moves down as a function of magnetic field,@xcite and in a double qd ( dqd ) different valley eigenstates may be identified via resonant tunneling .",
    "@xcite    since the two valleys are separated by a wave vector of the size of the brillouin zone , manipulation of the valley degree of freedom is a difficult task .",
    "no scheme has been experimentally demonstrated to date for achieving rotations of valley eigenstates in a 2deg or in a single qd . nevertheless , a recent work demonstrated that rotations of valley eigenstates can be implemented in a dqd , @xcite in which one can engineer local variations in the _ magnitude _ of the valley - orbit coupling .",
    "this is due to the fact that the magnitude of the valley - orbit coupling in si can be enhanced by a gate electric field .",
    "@xcite    the valley - orbit coupling is a complex number , with a magnitude and a phase .",
    "the meaning of the phase is somewhat elusive , and it is not observable in a single qd - one requires at least a dqd to observe phase - related effects .",
    "the gate electric field affects both the magnitude and the phase of the valley - orbit coupling , even though its effect on the phase is much smaller .",
    "@xcite in this work we demonstrate that controllable valley rotations in a dqd can also be accomplished using the _ phase _ of the valley - orbit coupling .",
    "we focus on a different parameter regime from that considered in ref .  .",
    "one key concept that we exploit is the fact that tunneling between _ like _ valley eigenstates ( i.e. conserving the valley eigenstate index ) and between _ opposite _ valley eigenstates ( not conserving the valley - eigenstate index ) are not independent processes .",
    "rather , one occurs at the expense of the other , and by controlling the phase of the valley - orbit coupling one can tune the tunneling between these two regimes .",
    "control of the phase of the valley - orbit coupling can be achieved using a gate electric field .",
    "we devise an analytical model for the valley - orbit coupling , including the correction due to the gate electric field .",
    "we determine expressions for the tunneling parameters between valley eigenstates , and their dependence on the phases of valley - orbit couplings in the two dots , as well as numerical estimates and a feasibility study for experimental implementation .",
    "we find that the rotation most likely to succeed experimentally involves the lowest two polarized triplet states in a dqd , which have different valley eigenstate composition .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : dqd ]",
    "we review briefly the model of the dqd , presenting the confinement potential and envelope functions , as well as an analytical scheme for calculating the valley - orbit coupling . in section [ sec : tnl ] we focus on the tunneling between valley eigenstates , determining the effect of a gate electric field on the phase of the valley - orbit coupling and its subsequent effect on interdot tunneling .",
    "we supply numerical estimates of the change in phase of the valley - orbit coupling and of the intervalley tunneling parameter .",
    "section [ sec : rot ] discusses the coherent rotation of valley eigenstates of the two lowest polarized triplets in a dqd , including experimental considerations .",
