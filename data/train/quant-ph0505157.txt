    "a system can retain the information of its motion when it undergoes a cyclic evolution , in the form of a geometric phase ( gp ) , which was first put forward by pancharatnam in optics @xcite and later studied explicitly by berry in a general quantal system@xcite .",
    "great progress has been made in this novel region @xcite ; the original adiabatic condition in berry s work has been removed by aharonov and anandan @xcite , and samuel and bhandari have generalized the geometric phase by extending to noncyclic evolution and sequential measurements @xcite . at the same time a kinematic approach to the theory of the geometric phase has also been developed by mukunda and simon @xcite .",
    "recently the generalization to mixed states was conducted first by uhlmann in the mathematical context of purification @xcite , and then by sjqvist _",
    "_ based on the mach - zender interferometer @xcite . consequently the mixed - state geometric phase has been experimentally verified using both nmr interferometry @xcite and single photon interferometry @xcite .",
    "recently the geometric phase for mixed state was put forward by singh _",
    "et al . _ for the case of degenerate density operators @xcite and a general formula for the parallel transporting",
    "was also provided . despite the great progress in this field",
    ", bhandari recently raised the criticism that the definition for geometric phase in mixed state fails when the interference fringes disappear @xcite .",
    "this can be explained as the disappearance ( appearance ) of the geometric phase ( off - diagonal geometric phase ) .",
    "the definition of off - diagonal geometric phase(op ) was first given by manini _",
    "et al . _ for pure states in adiabatic evolutions@xcite , and then was generalized to non - adiabatic situation@xcite and in mixed - states@xcite .",
    "moreover the off - diagonal geometric phase was studied in degenerate case @xciteand in bipartite systems@xcite .",
    "recently the effect of entanglement on the off - diagonal geometric phase has also discussed @xcite .",
    "the quantum computation scheme for the geometric phase has been proposed based on the abelian @xcite or non - abelian geometric phase @xcite , in which geometric phase has been shown to be intrinsic against faults in the presence of some kind of external noise due to the geometric nature of berry phase .",
    "consequently the quantum gates based on geometric phase have also been proposed in different systems @xcite , where the interactions play an important role for the realization of some specific operations .",
    "bipartite system is of great importance in quantum computation , such as the transfer of quantum information , the construction of entanglement as well as the realizations of logic operations .",
    "furthermore , it was found that gps may be used to design quantum logic gates .",
    "these facts together give rise to a question what are the geometric phase and its motion in bipartite systems .",
    "recently some papers have addressed this issue @xcite , where the discussions respectively focus on the entanglement dependence of the geometric phase for subsystem and the coupling effect on the gp for subsystem under adiabatical evolution . however , another question remains open ; how the entanglement or interaction affects the geometric phase for the whole system .",
    "this consideration is not trivial since any quantum information procession can not implemented by only one qubit . moreover",
    "some interesting results may be found with the increment of the size of the system . in this paper , focusing on the entanglement and inter - subsystem couplings , we present explicit discussion on the geometric phases in bipartite systems .    for this purpose ,",
    "our discussion is divided into several sections . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the model to be discussed in this paper and some formulas are also present for the calculation of the geometric phase . then in sec .",
    "iii we study the geometric phase for two noninteracting particles and some interesting results can be found in this section . the intra - subsystem coupling effect on the geometric phase",
    "is studied in sec .",
    "finally , conclusions are given at the end of this paper .",
    "in order to highlight the effect of the entanglement , we choose the initial state as @xmath1 where @xmath2 $ ] determines the mixing of this state and @xmath3 is the unit matrix in the @xmath4 hilbert space .",
    "notice that for @xmath5 eq . is the unit matrix and its geometric phase is trivial ( always be zero ) , our discussion excludes this case .",
    "the state @xmath6 may be either of the following states , @xmath7 where @xmath8 determines the degree of entanglement and @xmath9 is the eigenstate of pauli operator @xmath10 .",
    "one should note that when @xmath11 , the equations above are bell states and eq.([rho ] ) are the werner states @xcite , which plays an important role in quantum information processings , especially in quantum communication via noisy channels @xcite and quantum distillation @xcite .",
    "in general the mixed state eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) , which first was introduced by wootters @xcite , may be entangled ; that can be judged by the peres - horodecki condition @xcite .",
    "( [ rho ] ) includes all possible cases , such as pure or mixed state and maximal or non - maximal entangled states .",
    "one should note that eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) is triplet - degenerate for @xmath12 .",
    "we should point out that the initial state eq . is not a trivial generalizing from the pure case .",
    "the first term in eq . can be regarded as the noise and the mixing coefficient @xmath13 properly describe the intensity of noise .",
    "recently the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath13 of werner state and the temperature @xmath14 of the one - dimensional heisenberg two - spin chain with a magnetic field @xmath15 along the @xmath16-axis , has been established @xcite .",
    "this connection gives us the strong physical support for the initial state eq . .",
    "we choose the system composed of two spin-1/2 particles undergoing spin procession in an external time independent magnetic field in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "then the hamiltonian is @xmath17 in which the free hamiltonian @xmath18 and the xx interaction @xmath19 are respectively @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the antiferromagnetism coupling constant and @xmath22 is the @xmath16 component of spin operator respectively .",
    "@xmath23 are the raising and decreasing operators of the @xmath16 component of spin-1/2 . actually the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) is two - qubit xx model , which is of fundamental importance to understand the relation between the entanglement and quantum correlation in interacting many - body systems . in general",
    "we suppose that @xmath24 may not be equal to @xmath25 because of the inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field .",
    "one will find in the following discussion that the inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field has nontrivial effect on gp .",
    "some formulas should be addressed for the calculation of gp in this model .",
    "recently gp for the mixed state has been discussed by sjqvist _",
    "_ et al.__in @xcite , based on the mach - zender interferometer and a formula was provided for calculation of gp for a mixed state , @xmath26,\\ ] ] in which @xmath27 was defined as the parallel transportation operator .",
    "based on this work , singh , _ et al . , _",
    "@xcite studied gp for non - degenerate and degenerate mixed states and provided a general method for the construction of @xmath27 by imposing @xmath28 in which @xmath29 is the unitary evolution operator and is equal to @xmath30 in our model and @xmath31 is a blocked matrix , of which the elements are determined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the eigenstates of @xmath34 , and the interference terms between the degenerate space and the other space are set to be zero in order to keep the parallel transporting in the degenerate space .",
    "one notes that for different mixed states one has different @xmath27 .",
    "based on these formulas , one can calculate gp . in the following calculations , we label",
    "the initial states as @xmath35 and the geometric phases for these states are respectively calculated in the following parts .",
    "we first study the geometric phase without interaction . it should point out that this situation still has interest in quantum information , such as the quantum teleportation and communication in which the nonlocal correlation , i. e. the entanglement between two space - liked particles plays a crucial role . the geometric phases for @xmath37(i=1,2)in",
    "this case can be easily obtained from the formulas in the former section ,    @xmath38\\cos\\frac{\\omega_1+\\omega_2}{2}t - \\cos2\\theta \\cos[\\cos2\\theta\\frac{\\omega_1+\\omega_2}{2 } t]\\sin\\frac{\\omega_1+\\omega_2}{2}t ) } { \\frac{1-r}{2}+\\frac{1+r}{2}(\\cos[\\cos2\\theta\\frac{\\omega_1+\\omega_2}{2 } t]\\cos\\frac{\\omega_1+\\omega_2}{2}t + \\cos2\\theta \\sin[\\cos2\\theta\\frac{\\omega_1+\\omega_2}{2 } t]\\sin\\frac{\\omega_1+\\omega_2}{2}t)}\\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma_{g2}&=&\\arctan\\frac{-r(\\sin[\\cos2\\theta\\frac{\\omega_1-\\omega_2}{2 } t]\\cos\\frac{\\omega_1-\\omega_2}{2}t - \\cos2\\theta \\cos[\\cos2\\theta\\frac{\\omega_1-\\omega_2}{2 } t]\\sin\\frac{\\omega_1-\\omega_2}{2}t ) } { \\frac{1-r}{2}+\\frac{1+r}{2}(\\cos[\\cos2\\theta\\frac{\\omega_1-\\omega_2}{2 } t]\\cos\\frac{\\omega_1-\\omega_2}{2}t + \\cos2\\theta \\sin[\\cos2\\theta\\frac{\\omega_1-\\omega_2}{2 } t]\\sin\\frac{\\omega_1-\\omega_2}{2}t)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    f1a ( 40,10)@xmath8 ( 20,80)@xmath13 ( -8,60)@xmath39 ( 0,75)(a )    f1b ( 40,10)@xmath8 ( 20,70)@xmath13 ( 0,60)@xmath40 ( 0,75)(b )    f2a ( -5,32 )    90 @xmath39    ( 55,-5)@xmath8 ( 15 , 55)(a )    f2b ( 3,32 )    90@xmath40    ( 55,-5)@xmath8 ( 15 , 55)(b )     +    f2c ( -5,32 )    90 @xmath39    ( 55,-5)@xmath8 ( 18 , 53)(c )    f2d ( 3,32 )    90 @xmath40    ( 55,-5)@xmath8 ( 18 , 53)(d )    it is interesting to note that when the initial states are werner states , the geometric phase is zero when the denominators in eqs . are not vanishing simultaneously .",
    "furthermore when @xmath41 , the geometric phase for @xmath42 is zero since @xmath42 is commutative with the hamiltonian and it can not pick up any geometric phase . a detailed demonstration for @xmath43 with the parameters @xmath44 is shown in fig . [ 1 ] . from the figures it is obvious that the absolute values of @xmath45 attain the maximum when @xmath46 and because of the mixing , scaled by @xmath13 , the absolute value of geometric phase is compressed and tends to be zero with @xmath47 .",
    "we also note that a singularity about @xmath39 appears when @xmath11 and @xmath48 , as displayed in fig .",
    "at this point , the numerator and the dominator in the expression of @xmath39 in eq .",
    "are simultaneously zero and the geometric phase is undefined .",
    "one has to calculate the so - called off - diagonal geometric phase to retain the information of the evolution @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our calculation shows that the singularity depends not only on the entanglement , but on how the system evolves .    with the consideration of the two noninteracting particles , it is of interest to discuss the effect of the inhomogeneity of the external fields .",
    "the results have been illustrated in fig .",
    "it clearly shows that when there is a singular point , for @xmath49 , the absolute value of the geometric phase with @xmath50 attains the maximum closed to this point .",
    "whereas , for @xmath51 , this happens for @xmath52 .",
    "we should emphasize that this phenomenon appears only when there exists the singularity , which is induced by the entanglement of the initial state .",
    "if there is no possibility of the appearance of the singularity , our calculation shows that the points where the absolute value of the geometric phase attains the maximum is independent of the inhomogeneity of the external field , just shown as fig.[2](c)and ( d ) and always is zero for the werner state .",
    "physically it is thus possible for this phenomenon to act as the signature of the singularity of the geometric phase , which is usually originated from the degenerace @xcite .",
    "another interesting consideration is that one supposes @xmath53 , which corresponds to case that particle a is processing with frequency @xmath54 while particle b keep dynamically fixed . in this case , the affect from the dynamics of the second particle is excluded and one can more clearly check the effect of the entanglement on the geometric phase . the geometric phase for this special situation can be obtained by setting @xmath55 in eq . .",
    "one can find that because of the entanglement , the geometric phase for particle 1 is zero too for werner state . and",
    "it is also possible for the singularity to appear , for example when @xmath48 and @xmath56 .",

    "so in this section we focus on the effect of coupling on the geometric phase .",

    "because of the coupling , the geometric phase for the werner state is obviously very different from the free case . from these figures",

    "one also notes that because of the mixing , which is scaled by the parameter @xmath13 , the absolute values of gp is compressed , which is same as the free case .",
    "the effect of the inhomogeneity of magnetic field also discussed .",

    "because of the mixing , scaled by @xmath13 , it is compressed .",
    "furthermore the geometric phase is always zero for the werner state .",

    "the results show that gp is completely determined by the rescaled coupling constant @xmath0 and attain the maximal or minimal value when @xmath74 .",
    "similar to the free case , we also discussed the effect of the inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field .",
    "the results show that for werner state gp is always zero when system is in a homogeneous external magnetic field , independent of the interaction .",
    "furthermore with @xmath75 , the absolute value of gp attains a maximum at the point @xmath76 . the geometric phase for @xmath55 is also studied .",
