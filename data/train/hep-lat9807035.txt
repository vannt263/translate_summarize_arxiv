    "the screening of static chromo - electric fields is one of the most outstanding properties of @xmath1 and its investigation is important both from a theoretical and phenomenological point of view ( for phenomenological applications see e.g. @xcite ) . in leading order of perturbation theory the associated inverse screening length ( debye mass )",
    "is defined as the @xmath2 limit of the longitudinal part of the gluon self energy @xmath3 . however , as the screening phenomenon is related to the long distance behaviour of @xmath1 the naive perturbative definition of the debye mass is obstructed by severe @xmath2 divergences of thermal field theory and beyond leading order the above definition is no longer applicable .",
    "it was suggested by rebhan @xcite to define the debye mass as a pole of the longitudinal part of the gluon propagator .",
    "such a definition implies a self - consistent resummation of the perturbative series and ensures the gauge - independence and @xmath2 finiteness of the debye mass .",
    "however , it requires the introduction of a so - called magnetic screening mass , a concept introduced long ago @xcite to cure the @xmath2 singularities of finite temperature non - abelian theories .",
    "analogously to the electric ( debye ) mass the magnetic mass can be defined as a pole of the transverse part of the finite temperature gluon propagator .",
    "though the magnetic mass is not calculable in perturbation theory different self - consistent resummation schemes of the perturbative series give a non - vanishing magnetic mass @xcite .",
    "the non - zero magnetic mass is also clearly seen in lattice studies of propagators in @xmath0 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "as the screening masses are static quantities it is expected that they can be determined in a 3d effective theory of @xmath1 , the 3d @xmath4 adjoint higgs model , provided the temperature is high enough . however , in the case of @xmath1 one may worry whether the standard arguments of dimensional reduction apply .",
    "first of all the coupling constant is large @xmath5 for any physically interesting temperature and thus the requirement @xmath6 is not really satisfied .",
    "moreover , it is at present not clear which phase of the effective theory corresponds to the high temperature phase of @xmath1 . the 3d adjoint higgs model is known to have two phases , the symmetric ( confinement ) phase and the higgs ( coulomb ) phase @xcite .",
    "the perturbative calculation of the effective potential @xcite in the effective theory suggests that the higgs phase corresponds to the deconfined phase of 4d @xmath4 theory .",
    "this conclusion seems to be supported by the 2-loop level dimensional reduction performed in @xcite . on the other hand in the dimensional reduction approach applied in @xcite",
    "the symmetric phase turns out to be the physical one and a good description of spatial wilson loops and polyakov loop correlators has been obtained .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to clarify whether the screening masses , defined as poles of the corresponding lattice propagators in landau gauge , can be determined in the effective theory for the simplest case of the @xmath0 gauge group , where precise 4d data on screening masses exist for a huge temperature range @xcite .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath4 case and the inclusion of fermions is then straightforward .",
    "there are several reasons which make the study of the screening masses , defined as poles of the corresponding propagators , in the effective theory interesting .",
    "first of all it is possible to compare masses defined in this way directly with 4d measurements and thus clarify the status of the 3d adjoint higgs model as an effective theory .",
    "secondly the masses defined in this way are closest to the spirit of resummation techniques , which implicitly rely on dimensional reduction ( see e.g. discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "a third reason is that gauge invariant definitions of the debye mass rely on the 3d effective theory @xcite and although these definitions are the best in the sense that they are explicitly gauge invariant , the corresponding correlators have not been measured yet in the 4d theory .",
    "gauge invariant definitions yield larger masses than the pole masses @xcite and further studies are required to establish the connection between them .",
    "we will try to relate these masses in the last section of our paper in the spirit of the so - called constituent model @xcite .",
    "the lattice action for the 3d adjoint higgs model used in the present paper has the form & & s=_p tr u_p + _ , i tr a_0 ( ) u_i ( ) a_0(+i ) u_i^ ( ) + + & & _ , [ act ] where @xmath7 is the plaquette , @xmath8 are the usual link variables and the adjoint higgs field is parameterized , as in @xcite by anti - hermitian matrices @xmath9 ( @xmath10 are the usual pauli matricies ) .",
    "furthermore @xmath11 is the lattice gauge coupling , @xmath12 parameterizes the quartic self coupling of the higgs field and @xmath13 denotes the bare higgs mass squared . in principle the parameters appearing in eq .",
    "( [ act ] ) can be related to the parameters of the original 4d theory via the procedure of dimensional reduction @xcite , which is essentially perturbative .",
    "another possible procedure is to find the above parameters by matching some quantities which are equally well calculable both in the full 4d lattice theory and in the effective 3d lattice theory , i.e. to perform a non - perturbative matching . since the validity of the perturbative dimensional reduction , as was discussed before , is not obvious in the case of @xmath1 ( or more precisely for @xmath14 gauge theories )",
    "we will try to explore the latter approach in the present paper .",
    "in general this would require a matching analysis in a 3d parameter space ( @xmath15 ) , which is clearly difficult in general .",
    "we thus followed a more moderate approach and fix two of three parameters namely @xmath11 and @xmath12 , to the values obtained from the perturbative procedure of dimensional reduction .",
    "the values of these parameters at 2-loop level are @xcite 0.3truecm & & = 4g_3 ^ 2 a , + & & g_3 ^ 2=g^2 ( ) t , + & & x = g^2()3 ^2 , + & & l=443 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 denoting the lattice spacing and temperature , respectively .",
    "the coupling constant of the 4d theory @xmath18 is defined through the 2-loop formula g^-2()=1112 ^2 + 1744 ^2 .",
    "[ 4dg ] in order to be able to compare the results of the 3d simulation with the corresponding ones in the 4d theory it is necessary to fix the renormalization and the temperature scale .",
    "we choose the renormalization scale to be @xmath19 , which ensures that corrections to the leading order results for the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath12 of the effective theory are small .",
    "furthermore we use the relation @xmath21 from @xcite .",
    "now the temperature scale is fixed completely and the physical temperature may be varied by varying the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the lattice spacing was chosen according to the criterium @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the extension of the lattice and @xmath24 is the mass we want to measure .",
    "the main goal of the present investigation is to study the propagators of scalar and vector ( gauge ) fields . for this purpose",
    "one has to fix a specific gauge , which is chosen to be the landau gauge @xmath25 . on the lattice",
    "this is realized by maximizing the quantity : tr [ max ] the gauge fixing is performed using the overrelaxation algorithm , which in our case is as efficient as combined overrelaxation and @xmath26 algorithm used in @xcite .",
    "the vector field is defined in terms of link variables as a_i()=12 i ( u_i()-u^_i ( ) ) we are interested in extracting the electric ( debye ) @xmath27 and the magnetic @xmath28 screening masses from the long distance behaviour of the scalar and vector propagators defined as & & g_d(z)= < tr a_0(z ) a_0^(0 ) > ~(- m_d z ) , + & & g_t(z)= 12 ( g_1(z ) + g_2(z ) ) ~(- m_t z ) , with & & g_i(z)= < tr a_i(z ) a_i(0 ) > , + & & a_(z)=_x , y a_(x , y , z),=0 ,  1 ,  2 note that due to the landau gauge condition @xmath29 should be constant .",
    "this fact can be used to test the precision and validity of the gauge fixing procedure . in our case",
    "this condition is satisfied with an accuracy of @xmath30 .",
    "besides the scalar and vector propagators of the adjoint higgs model we also calculate the gauge invariant scalar correlators and analyze the propagators in the limit of a 3d pure gauge theory .",
    "to extract the masses from the correlation functions we have used the general fitting ansatz a [ fiti ] motivated in @xcite through the analysis of the gauge dependence of the electron propagator in qed .",
    "previous investigations of gauge boson and quark propagators in landau gauge @xcite have shown that effective masses extracted from the correlation functions rise with increasing euclidean time separation and eventually reach a plateau .",
    "this is contrary to local masses extracted from gauge invariant correlation functions which approach a plateau from above and is a direct consequence of a non - positive transfer matrix in landau gauge .",
    "a fit with @xmath31 can account for the observed drift in local masses and allows to extract stable masses already at shorter distances .",
    "most of our numerical studies have been performed on lattices of size lattice and checked explicitly that results for the electric mass show no volume dependence .",
    "furthermore some calculations have been performed on a @xmath32 lattice to check that the lattice size used for our calculations was sufficient for the determination of the magnetic mass . ]",
    "@xmath33 . from previous studies of gluon propagators in the 4-dimensional su(2 )",
    "gauge theory we know that such large lattices are needed to observe a plateau in local masses @xcite .",
    "this is in particular the case for the rather small magnetic screening mass which leads to a rather slow decay of the correlation functions .",
    "we thus use the same spatial lattice size as in those studies .",
    "we have used correlated ( michael - mckerrell ) fits with eigenvalue smearing @xcite .",
    "our fits have been constrained to the region where local masses show a plateau ( typically @xmath34 for the magnetic mass and @xmath35 for the electric mass )",
    ". in this region fits with @xmath36 and @xmath31 yield consistent results within statistical errors . from fits with @xmath31 we find best fits with @xmath37 ,",
    "in accordance with the behaviour of local masses discussed above . however , although these fits with @xmath38 can start at shorter distances , @xmath39 , and still yield a good @xmath40 , the magnitude of @xmath41 is not well determined within our present statistical accuracy . in the following",
    "we thus will quote results from fits with @xmath36 .",
    "the deconfined high temperature phase of the 4d @xmath0 field theory corresponds to some surface @xmath42 in the parameter space ( @xmath43 ) of the adjoint higgs model .",
    "this is the surface of 4d physics and may lie in the symmetric or the broken phase . for fixed value of @xmath11 ( lattice spacing ) the 4d physics is described by a line on this surface . since most of our simulation were done for @xmath44 we will refer later to this line as the line of 4d physics . in the present paper three choices for the line of 4d",
    "physics @xmath45 are explored .",
    "a comparison with 4d simulations should allow to determine the physical line @xmath45 which reproduces the result of the 4d analysis .",
    "the first choice for @xmath45 is the perturbative line of 4d physics , calculated in @xcite and lying in the broken phase , the other two choices are in the symmetric phase .",
    "the three choices for the line of 4d physics are illustrated on figure 1 for @xmath44 .",
    "the actual procedure we used to choose the parameter @xmath13 in the symmetric phase is the following .",
    "first we have determined the transition line @xmath46 . the transition line as function of @xmath12 in the infinite volume limit",
    "was found in @xcite in terms of the renormalized mass parameter @xmath47 ( @xmath24 is the continuum renormalized mass ) .",
    "the transition line in terms of @xmath48 turns out to be independent of @xmath11 . then using eq .",
    "( 5.7 ) from @xcite one can calculate @xmath46 .",
    "the usage of the infinite volume result for the transition line seems to be justified because most of our simulation were done on a @xmath49 lattice .",
    "the two sets of @xmath45 values , which appear on figure 1 , were chosen so that the renormalized mass parameter @xmath48 ( calculated using eq .",
    "( 5.7 ) of @xcite ) always stays @xmath50 and @xmath51 away from the transition line .",
    "these values of @xmath13 are of course _ ad hoc _ and one should use them only as trial values .",
    "the values of the parameters in the symmetric phase are shown in table 1 where the two sets of @xmath13 values are denoted as ( i ) and ( ii ) and also the values of @xmath52 corresponding to the transition line are given .",
    "0.5truecm    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     0.3truecm table  3 : _ the masses of the scalar bound state measured on @xmath53 lattice and the glueball mass taken from @xcite in units of @xmath20 compared with the predictions of the constituent model",
    "_    0.3truecm another gauge invariant operator , whose correlation function was measured in @xcite , is @xmath54 .",
    "the mass extracted from this correlator is the mass of the bound state of the scalar field and the light glue , thus its mass in terms of the constituent model is expected to be @xmath55 .",
    "our numerical simulations show that @xmath56 in the entire temperature range , therefore one would expect that @xmath57 . on the other hand the numerical simulation in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that this condition is satisfied only in the parameter range which does not corresponds to the physical situation . in this respect",
    "the constituent model seems to fail to explain the spectrum of the theory .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the propagators of the 3d @xmath0 adjoint higgs model in landau gauge .",
    "masses extracted from them are compared with the corresponding ones from recent simulations of the high temperature @xmath0 theory @xcite .",
    "the gauge coupling and the higgs quartic coupling of the effective theory were fixed via the procedure of dimensional reduction , while the bare higgs mass @xmath13 was left free to allow for an non - perturbative matching .",
    "we have considered the values of @xmath13 which correspond to the broken phase and two sets of @xmath13 in the symmetric phase .",
    "the screening masses in the symmetric phase are in good agreement with the results of the 4d theory with both set of @xmath13 , which means that the propagator masses in the symmetric phase are not too sensitive to the value of the bare mass . in the broken phase",
    "the propagators are quite different from those in the symmetric phase and 4d simulation .",
    "in particular the scalar propagator does not seem to show an exponential behaviour , while the vector propagators yield several times smaller masses than what is obtained in 4d simulation .",
    "the magnetic mass in the adjoint higgs model scales with @xmath20 and its value is very close to the value of the mass gap obtained in the pure 3d gauge theory .",
    "we have also measured gauge invariant correlators of the scalar field .",
    "the resulting mass as well the mass of the lightest glueball can be related to the propagator masses via the constituent model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the mass of the vector bound state , measured in @xcite , however , can not be understood in this way .",
