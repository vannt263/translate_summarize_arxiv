    "fluorescent fe k lines are common in the x - ray spectra of accreting black holes , ranging from x - ray binaries to active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and provide one of the best probes for studying accretion disks . if the fe k line is emitted from the inner part of the accretion disk , it becomes broad and asymmetric due to both doppler shift and gravitational redshift ( fabian et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the best example of a broad fe k line is seen in the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg63015 ( tanaka et al . 1995 ) .",
    "broad fe k lines have been observed in many other sources and are thought to be very common in the x - ray spectra of seyfert 1 nuclei ( nandra et al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "recent observations of agns with _ xmm - newton _ show that the broad fe k line is not as common as previously believed .",
    "while a few seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , mcg63015 , mrk 205 , mrk 509 ) indeed show an unambiguous broad line , fe lines in other galaxies are dominated by a relatively narrow feature . from an analysis of 53 type 1 agns",
    "observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _",
    ", page et al . ( 2004a ) showed that a broad fe k line ( @xmath4kev ) is seen in only 13 sources , while the remaining 40 sources have a narrow line ( @xmath5kev ) or no lines .",
    "some of the 13 sources show a narrow line as well as the broad line . in a similar study ,",
    "yaqoob & padmanabhan ( 2004 ) reported the results of 18 observations of 15 seyfert 1 galaxies observed with the _ chandra _ high energy grating .",
    "they measured the width of the line core and obtained a weighted mean of fwhm = 2380@xmath6 760 kms@xmath7 , which is slightly larger than the instrument resolution ( fwhm @xmath8 1860 kms@xmath7 ) .",
    "evidence of underlying broad - line emission was also found in at least four sources .",
    "based on these recent studies , it is still controversial whether or not relativistically broadened fe k emission is truly common in nearby agns .",
    "streblyanska et al .",
    "( 2005 ) derived an average rest - frame spectrum of agns detected in a 770 ksec _ xmm - newton _ observation of the lockman hole field .",
    "they used a sample of 104 x - ray sources with optical redshifts measured by lehmann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , analyzing separately the type 1 and type 2 subsamples defined by optical spectra ( schmidt et al . 1998 ; lehman et al . 2001 ) . from composite rest - frame spectra generated for the type 1 and type 2 sources , they found evidence for a broad line peaking at a rest - frame energy @xmath96.4kev with an equivalent width ( ew ) @xmath9560ev and @xmath9460ev , respectively .",
    "however , it should be noted that there are some systematic uncertainties in modelling the continuum , since it is virtually impossible to distinguish a very broad line clearly from the continuum for sources as faint as those analyzed by streblyanska et al .",
    "in addition , making composite spectra of faint sources may introduce spurious spectral features ( yaqoob 2005 ) .",
    "brusa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and comastri et al .",
    "( 2007 ) studied average spectra of agns detected in the _ chandra _ deep field north and south .",
    "they stacked the x - ray counts in the observed frame from spectroscopically identified agns , using a large number of source spectra within sufficiently narrow redshift ranges such that the energy ( redshift ) spread is negligible .",
    "a broad fe line is seen in some of the stacked spectra and is fitted with a relativistic disk line model peaking at a rest - energy of 6.4 kev . since the fluxes of the objects in the sample are low , this study may suffer from the same uncertainties affecting the streblyanska et al .",
    "analysis of the lockman hole .",
    "what parameters of the agn affect the strength or profile of the fe k line ?",
    "an inverse correlation between the equivalent width of fe k line and x - ray luminosity , known as the x - ray baldwin effect , was first pointed out by iwasawa & taniguchi ( 1993 ) .",
    "this correlation has been confirmed with _ asca _ ( nandra et al .",
    "1997b ) and _ xmm - newton _ data ( page et al . 2004a ; see also jimnez - bailn et al .",
    "the dependence of the iron line profile with luminosity was investigated by nandra et al .",
    "( 1997b ) using 18 seyfert 1s and 21 quasars observed with _ asca_. they divided the sample into five luminosity bins and examined average fe k line profiles .",
    "the line shows a very similar profile , which is composed of a narrow core and a broad red wing for groups with a luminosity below @xmath10 .",
    "the intensity of the narrow core , however , becomes weak above this luminosity .",
    "the red wing becomes weak and the peak energy shifts to higher energy for the luminosity range of @xmath11 ; no evidence for line emission is observed above @xmath12 .",
    "jimnez - bailn et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , analyzing a sample of 39 palomar - green ( pg ; schmidt & green 1983 ) quasars observed with _ xmm - newton _ , found a similar result as that reported by nandra et al .",
    "( 1997b ) .",
    "the luminosity dependence of the fe k line may be related to the ionization level of the accretion disk .",
    "this paper examines the behavior of the fe k line as a function of accretion rate , as parameterized by the eddington ratio , taking advantage of the availability of black hole mass and bolometric luminosity estimates .",
    "the eddington ratio is a fundamental parameter that may control both the ionization state and geometric structure of the accretion disk .",
    "if so , we expect the profile of the fe k line , in particular its width and central energy , to vary systematically with eddington ratio .",
    "the goal of this study is to investigate this issue .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the observations , and section 3 shows the results of the spectral analysis of average spectra and its eddington ratio dependence .",
    "we discuss the physical origin of the eddington ratio dependence in section 4 .",
    "our findings are summarized in section 5 .",
    "we selected our sample from the 87 low - redshift ( @xmath13 ) palomar - green quasars in boroson & green ( 1992 ) .",
    "x - ray data for 45 objects are available in the _ xmm - newton _ science archive ( xsa ) . only epic - pn data were used in the following analysis since the effective area of pn is much larger than that of epic - mos .",
    "pg 1001 + 045 was excluded from the present study because no epic - pn data are available .",
    "pg 1226 + 023 ( 3c 273 ) , a very bright quasar , was also excluded since it overwhelms the x - ray flux in the average spectrum examined below .",
    "basic data ( name , redshift , central black hole mass , and eddington ratio ) for the final sample of 43 objects are given in table [ tab : the sample ] .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ results of 34 objects have been published , and the references are also given in table [ tab : the sample ] .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table [ tab : the sample xray ] .",
    "the black hole masses and eddington ratios are taken from the study of l. c. ho ( 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "ho calculates black hole masses employing the virial method of kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , using broad h@xmath14 line widths from boroson & green ( 1992 ) and 5100   continuum luminosities from neugebauer et al .",
    "his bolometric luminosities come from direct integration of the full , broad - band ( radio to x - rays ) spectral energy distribution rather than from a single band assuming a bolometric correction .",
    "all distance - dependent quantities were derived assuming the following cosmological parameters : @xmath15 , and @xmath16 = 72 kms mpc@xmath7 .",

    "we derived a co - added rest - frame spectrum of the 43 quasars in order to examine the average shape of the fe k emission line . since each object has a different redshift and thus a different observed line energy , the detector response , which is energy dependent , is different for each object .",

    "therefore , the spectrum derived here is for presentation purpose only , and quantitative analysis by simultaneous fitting is done in the next subsection .    the co - added spectrum was constructed as follows .",
