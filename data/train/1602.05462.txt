    "concerning hardware complexity and energy consumption of signal processing systems , the circuit forming the analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) at the receiver has been identified as a bottleneck @xcite .",
    "while a high number of bits @xmath3 allows accurate representation of the analog signals in the digital domain and therefore high processing performance , the power dissipation and production cost of the adc device scales exponentially @xmath4 with @xmath3 .",
    "an interesting approach is to reduce the resolution of the adc and resort to a simple device without feedback . in the extreme case the continuous analog waveform at each sensor",
    "is directly converted into a binary representation by a hard - limiter .",
    "the circuit for such an adc can be realized by a single comparator , making the adc highly efficient with respect to its hardware and energy requirements .",
    "further , the binary structure of the resulting receive signal allows to perform basic signal processing operations in the digital domain by efficient @xmath0-bit arithmetics @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-bit adc also provides a beneficial effect on the complexity of the digital processing unit of the receive system .    nevertheless , a serious drawback of @xmath0-bit adc is that a highly nonlinear and noninvertible operation is performed on the original analog receive signal . in comparison to an ideal receive system with @xmath5-bit adc resolution",
    "this is associated with a significant performance loss .",
    "it is well understood that for certain problems , i.e. , location parameter estimation with uncorrelated noise , the performance gap between a symmetric hard - limiting @xmath0-bit system and an ideal receiver with infinite adc resolution is moderate ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 db ) in the low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime @xcite @xcite . however",
    ", important technologies like wireless communication usually take place in the medium snr regime where the quantization loss is more pronounced .",
    "in particular for such scenarios we have identified that introducing redundancy by modification of the analog processing prior to the adc , allows to recover large portions of the @xmath0-bit loss @xcite . to analyze this effect ,",
    "we have developed a compact lower bound for the fisher information measure @xcite and recently generalized it , in order to obtain better bounding accuracy for advanced signal parameter estimation problems @xcite .",
    "further , we have shown that the underlying methodology of exponential replacement leads to an approximate formulation of the likelihood function which can be used to formulate point estimation algorithms that achieve the conservative inference capability of the nonlinear stochastic system in a consistent way@xcite .",
    "while in @xcite we focused on parametric location parameter estimation of a hard - limited multivariate gaussian variable with fixed covariance matrix , here we center the discussion around the estimation of a parameter modulating the covariance matrix of a zero - mean multivariate gaussian variable after @xmath0-bit quantization .",
    "this kind of estimation problem arises in wireless applications if the direction - of - arrival ( doa ) parameter of a transmit signal with unknown structure impinging on a receive array is to be determined .",
    "doa parameter estimation forms a specific application of blind covariance - based estimation and plays a key role for technologies like wireless multi - user communication , spectrum monitoring , jammer localization and interference mitigation for satellite - based radio systems .",
    "in order to clearly outline the estimation theoretic motivation behind the presented work , we review efficient covariance - based estimation with infinite adc resolution and outline the challenges arising when treating a receiver with @xmath0-bit adc .      consider a digital receive signal @xmath8 which is well represented by a multivariate gaussian random variable with probability density function @xmath9 with a single parameter @xmath10 modulating the covariance @xmath11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and vanishing mean @xmath12}={\\boldsymbol{0 } } , \\quad\\quad \\forall \\theta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] given @xmath1 independent data snapshots @xmath13 the optimum asymptotically unbiased estimator @xmath14 is obtained by maximizing the likelihood @xcite @xmath15 where the receive covariance is given by @xmath16 as the maximum - likelihood estimator is consistent and efficient , it is possible to characterize its asymptotic performance in an analytical way through the cramr - rao lower bound @xcite @xmath17 } \\geq \\frac{1}{nf_{{\\boldsymbol{y}}}(\\theta)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fisher information is defined @xmath18 for the multivariate gaussian model , we obtain@xcite @xmath19      the situation changes fundamentally if a nonlinear transformation @xmath20 is involved",
    ". then the derivation of an exact representation of the likelihood @xmath21 , and therefore processing the data with the maximum - likelihood approach , can become difficult .",
    "if we assume @xmath0-bit adc and model the converters by an element - wise hard - limiter which discards the amplitude information @xmath22 where the element - wise signum function is defined by @xmath23_n= \\begin{cases } + 1 & \\text{if } x_n \\geq 0\\\\ -1 & \\text{if } x_n < 0 , \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the likelihood function for one output constellation is found by evaluating the integral @xmath24 note , that @xmath25 is the subset of @xmath26 which is mapped to the output signal @xmath27 . computing such an integral requires the orthant probability of a multivariate gaussian variable ( multivariate version of the q - function ) .",
    "unfortunately , a general closed - form expression for the orthant probability is an open mathematical problem . only for the cases @xmath28 solutions",
    "are provided in literature @xcite @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes even worse , if one is interested in analytically evaluating the estimation performance of the @xmath0-bit receive system .",
    "the associated fisher information measure @xmath29 is computed by summing the squared score function over the discrete support of @xmath27 .",
    "as @xmath30 contains @xmath31 possible receive constellations , direct computation of @xmath32 is prohibitively complex when @xmath33 is large .",
    "due to the outlined problems and , the literature on analytic performance bounds and maximum - likelihood algorithms for parametric covariance estimation with @xmath0-bit quantization is limited .",
    "while @xcite @xcite are classical references for signal processing with @xmath0-bit quantizer , more recently @xcite covers the problem of signal parameter estimation from coarsely quantized data with uncorrelated noise .",
    "the work @xcite is concerned with @xmath0-bit doa estimation , but has to restrict the analytical discussion to @xmath34 sensors due to the outlined problem and resort to empirical methods of high computational complexity for @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast @xcite studies location parameter estimation with a multivariate model and dithered @xmath0-bit sampling while @xcite discusses inference of the autocorrelation function from hard - limited gaussian signals .    here",
    "we review the approach of exponential replacement which forms the basis for a generalized fisher information lower bound @xcite . for the application of doa estimation with @xmath0-bit quantized data this allows to derive a pessimistic cramr - rao performance bound and to analyze the achievable estimation accuracy with an arbitrary number of sensors @xmath2 .",
    "further , the exponential replacement enables to state a conservative version of the maximum - likelihood estimator which asymptotically performs equivalent to the presented pessimistic performance bound @xcite .",
    "consider an intractable parametric probabilistic model @xmath21 .",
