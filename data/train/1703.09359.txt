    "the understanding of transition of a stochastic system between disjoint regions in the phase space has applications in the study of chemical reactions and thermally activated process ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for such physical processes , the underlying dynamics can be often described by a stochastic process such as the overdamped langevin equation ( also known as the brownian dynamics ) , which we will focus on in this paper ( while our methods can be generalized to other scenarios ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the current configuration of the system at time @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a potential function , @xmath4 is the inverse temperature ( @xmath5 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath6 the absolute temperature ) , and @xmath7 is the standard @xmath8-dimensional wiener process . here",
    "@xmath9 is the configurational space of the system ( with some suitable boundary condition if @xmath9 is not the full space ) .",
    "we are interested in understanding the transition of the dynamics from a subset @xmath10 ( represents for example the reactant state ) to a disjoint subset @xmath11 ( represents for example the product state of the system ) .",
    "direct simulation of such transitions might be challenging since most of these systems exhibit time scale separations : it takes much longer time for the system to go from @xmath12 to @xmath13 compared to the intrinsic time scale of the dynamics ( which limits the time step size of numerical simulation ) . as a result ,",
    "the study of such rare transitions requires novel methodology development , which has been a very active area in physical chemistry and applied mathematics .",
    "the transition path theory , proposed by e and vanden - eijnden in @xcite and further developed in @xcite , is a framework to study the rare transitions in the phase space .",
    "see also the review article @xcite .",
    "in the transition path theory , the central role is played by the _ committor function _",
    "@xcite , which is the probability that a trajectory starting from @xmath15 first hits @xmath13 rather than @xmath12 . denote @xmath16 the first hitting time of a subset @xmath17 , the committor function is defined by @xmath18 intuitively the committor function indicates the progression of a transition : it takes the value @xmath19 on @xmath12 , @xmath20 on @xmath13 and increases going from @xmath12 to @xmath13 . in chemical terms , the committor function can be understood as a reaction coordinate of the transition ( see @xcite for a recent review on reaction coordinates ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath14 solves the following pde on @xmath21 with dirichlet boundary conditions given on @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the infinitesimal generator of the process , given by @xmath24 note that some boundary conditions are needed in the above equation if @xmath9 is not a closed manifold , which we will come back to later .",
    "once the committor function is provided , we can easily obtain information on the reaction rate , density of transition paths , current of transition paths @xcite , which help understand the stochastic system .",
    "moreover , we can also write down the sde for the transition path between @xmath12 and @xmath13 that only depends on the committor function @xcite , which can be used for transition path sampling @xcite . solving the pde for the committor function is however non - trivial due to the curse of dimensionality . as a result , in the framework of transition path theory ,",
    "further assumptions are usually made to approximate the committor function : it is assumed that the transition from @xmath12 to @xmath13 is concentrated in quasi - one dimensional `` reaction tube '' , which is the working assumption of the finite temperature string method @xcite . due to the usefulness of the committor function in understanding the transition ,",
    "other approaches have been also developed , mainly in the chemical physics literature , for example methods based on statistical analysis of an ensemble of trajectories @xcite , based on approximating the diffusion by a discrete state space jump process ( milestoning ) @xcite ( see also @xcite on direct computation of committor function on a discrete markov jump process ) . to the best of our knowledge , none of the existing methods aims at approximating the pde   directly .",
    "the main contribution of this work is to propose a method to directly solve the committor equation based on point cloud discretization , especially the technique of local mesh discretization recently developed in @xcite . assume a given point cloud samples the equilibrium distribution of the dynamics ,",
    "the idea is to discretize the pde on the point cloud to approximate the committor function . here",
    ", the working assumption is that while the configurational space of the stochastic system is high dimensional , the transition between the interested regions @xmath12 and @xmath13 lies in an intrinsically low - dimensional manifold ( for simplicity , we assume that the intrinsic dimension does not change ) . in particular , this generalizes the `` reaction tube '' assumption of the finite temperature string method to transition in higher than quasi - one dimension .    our method is closely related in spirit to the method of diffusion map @xcite . in particular , in the work @xcite and subsequently @xcite , the diffusion map has been applied to obtain an approximation of the infinitesimal generator to compute the first few low - lying eigenfunctions of @xmath23 , the fokker - planck operator .",
    "those eigenmodes are used to approximate the long time behavior and to coarse - grain the dynamics . as demonstrated in @xcite , the assumption that the stochastic dynamics can be approximated by low - dimensional reaction modes",
    "is indeed valid for a variety of chemical systems .",
    "it is in fact possible to use the idea of diffusion maps to approximate the equation for the committor function and we will compare our method with the diffusion map based method . let us also remark that we do not focus on the low - lying eigenmodes of fokker - planck equation as @xcite , but rather the committor function , which provides the information on the transition from @xmath12 to @xmath13 more directly .",
    "one potential advantage of focusing directly at the transition region is that we do not require point cloud to well represent the regions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are typically of high intrinsic dimension , as usually they correspond to regions of local minima of the potential energy surfaces , and hence leads to challenges for point cloud discretization .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite for further comparison between the committor function and low - lying eigenmodes . besides diffusion map and the local mesh method ,",
    "other numerical techniques have been also developed for solving pdes on point clouds without a mesh and this has been a very active area in recent years ; a brief review of those can be found in [ sec : localmesh ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the point cloud discretization method for the committor function is described in detail in [ sec : localmesh ] .",
    "the algorithm is validated and compared with other approaches through numerical examples in [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "we conclude the paper in [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "given a potential function @xmath25 defined on @xmath9 , recall that we aim at solving the following equation on @xmath9 represented as point clouds : @xmath26 note that compared to , we have also specified the neumann boundary condition at the boundary of @xmath27 , which is the natural boundary condition from a variational point of view , as discussed below .",
    "before we proceed to numerical algorithms , let us write down the weak formulation of .",
    "given any test function @xmath28 , using the equation and integration by parts , we have : @xmath29 where in the last equality , we have used the neumann boundary condition @xmath30 on @xmath31 so that the boundary contribution vanishes .",
    "note that the gibbs weight @xmath32 appeared in is the invariant measure @xmath33 of the overdamped equation up to a normalization constant @xmath34 .    in the transition path theory",
    "@xcite , after we compute @xmath35 , we can immediately obtain the transition rate between @xmath12 and @xmath13 provided by @xmath36 which we will later use to quantify the approximation quality of our numerical methods .",
    "the committor function also leads to other useful information to understand the dynamics , including the probability density of reactive trajectories @xmath37 and also the reactive current @xmath38 which can be obtained through explicit formulas based on @xmath14 .",
    "let us come back to numerical solution to . since @xmath9 is potentially high dimensional while the transition between the interested regions a and b lies in an intrinsically low - dimensional manifold , our idea is to solve the equation and get the approximation of @xmath14 instead on a point cloud well sampling the transition path .",
    "more precisely , assume that we are given a point cloud @xmath39 , for instance from snapshots of a long trajectory of the sde , the goal here is to approximate the committor function , given by based on @xmath40 .",
    "in particular , we are aiming at the value of @xmath14 on the point clouds , instead of on the whole configurational space @xmath9 .",
    "we will also interpret the sets @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the collection of points in the point cloud @xmath40 that lies in the two chosen sets in the whole configurational space .",
    "for simplicity of notation , when there is no danger of confusion , we will not distinguish in the sequel the sets @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath9 etc .",
    "with their point cloud interpretations .    in the rest of this section , we first give a brief review of the existing diffusion map based method  @xcite for approximating the fokker - planck equation on the given point clouds , which will be compared later with our method .",
    "after that , our method of solving the fokker - planck equation on point clouds will be presented based on the local mesh method discussed in  @xcite .      in recent years",
    ", several numerical schemes have been proposed for solving partial differential equations on point clouds without a global mesh or grid in the ambient space .",
    "these methods are particularly useful in high dimensions where a global triangulation or grid is intractable . among those methods ,",
    "a popular class of methods is kernel based , where the laplace - beltrami operator on point clouds is approximated by heat diffusion in the ambient euclidean space  @xcite or in the tangent space  @xcite among nearby points . in other words , the metric on the manifold is approximated by euclidean metric locally .",
    "the main advantage of such methods is their simplicity and generality for approximating diffusion type operators . among those ,",
    "the methods based on the ideas of diffusion map  @xcite have been rather popular . for discretizing the fokker - planck operator @xmath41 in on the point cloud ,",
    "one uses @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the normalized kernel function according to the gibbs weight @xmath44 : @xmath45 and @xmath46 being a diagonal matrix with @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the identity matrix of size @xmath49 . note that @xmath50 can be chosen either as a constant or adaptively depending on the local information of the data set using the multiscale svd method proposed in @xcite",
    "therefore , if we denote @xmath51 ( recall that these sets are interpreted as the subsets of points in @xmath40 ) , then the committor function @xmath52 $ ] can be solved by the linear equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 according to the boundary conditions of the committor function .",
    "we remark that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are denoted as the restriction of the matrix @xmath23 on the index set of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the above kernel based methods however usually render low order approximation .",
    "more recently , two new methods for solving pdes on point clouds are introduced in  @xcite , where the differential operators are approximated systematically and intrinsically at each point from local approximation of the manifold and its metric through nearby neighbors .",
    "these methods can achieve high order accuracy and can be used to approximate general differential operators ( _ i.e. _ , other than diffusion type operators ) on point clouds sampling manifolds with arbitrary dimensions and co - dimensions .",
    "moreover , the computational complexity depends mainly on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold rather than the dimension of the embedded space .    to solve on a point cloud ,",
    "we will focus on generalizing the local mesh method discussed in @xcite to fokker - planck operators .",
    "the local mesh method is natural to handle the neumann boundary conditions , which is more advantageous in the current scenario .",
    "the crucial part of solving the weak formula is to numerically approximate @xmath60 on the given point cloud .",
    "note that the definition of differential operators only rely on local information of point clouds .",
    "thus , our idea is composed of constructing local connectivity to approximate the gradient operator and estimating the stiffness matrix on point clouds . in the rest of this section",
    ", we will discuss technical details about local connectivity construction and the stiffness matrix approximation on point clouds .",
    "after that , a numerical method of solving the fokker - planck equation will be proposed .",
