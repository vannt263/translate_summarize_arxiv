    "the direct detection of gravitational radiation is one of the most pressing challenges in the physics of this century . predicted by einstein shortly after formulating his general theory of relativity , gravitational waves ( gw )",
    "will allow us to probe regions of space - time otherwise unobservable in the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "several experimental efforts have been underway for awhile , both on the ground and in space @xcite , and only recently kilometer - size ground - based interferometers have been able to identify the most stringent upper - limits to date for the amplitudes of the radiation expected from several classes of gw sources .",
    "although present - generation instruments have not been able yet to unambiguously observe gws , next - generation earth - based interferometers and pulsar - timing experiments @xcite , as well as newly envisioned space - based detectors @xcite , are expected to achieve this goal .",
    "the physical characteristics of the astrophysical sources emitting gravitational radiation varies significantly over the observational frequency bands of these detectors .",
    "depending on the specific detector design , we will observe gws emitted during cataclysmic events such as supernova explosions and coalescences of binary systems containing neutron stars and black - holes , spiraling white - dwarfs binaries in our galaxy and binary black - holes across the universe , and a stochastic background of astrophysical or cosmological origin @xcite .",
    "the detection of a stochastic background of cosmological origin , in particular , will allow us to infer properties about the very early universe and probe various cosmological models predicting the formation mechanism of the background . since the characteristic strength of such stochastic backgrounds is expected to be smaller than the instrumental noise level of present and of foreseeable future detectors , it is imperative to identify data processing techniques capable of enhancing the likelihood of detection .",
    "the most general and robust of such techniques relies on cross - correlating the data from pairs of detectors operating in coincidence and whose noises are uncorrelated . by virtue of observing the same gw signal while being affected by noise sources that are uncorrelated , the cross - correlation technique increases the resulting snr to a stochastic background by the square - root power of the integration time . by relying on a network of @xmath0 operating detectors ,",
    "the overall sensitivity can be further enhanced by a factor that depends on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "although the cross - correlation technique for detecting a background of gravitational radiation can be applied to ground - based detectors as they are large in number and widely separated on earth ( so their noises can be regarded as uncorrelated ) , it is presently unthinkable to extend it to space - based interferometers as only one might become operational in the next decade .",
    "although it might be argued that space - based interferometers such as lisa , for example , can generate up to three time - delay interferometric ( tdi ) combinations @xcite that could be cross - correlated , it is easy to see that their noises would be correlated making the cross - correlation technique ineffective ( in simple terms , a tdi combination has some of its noises correlated to those affecting the other tdi responses by virtue of sharing with them at least `` one - arm '' ) .",
    "these considerations imply that a data processing technique for detecting a background of gravitational radiation with a single - detector response is required .",
    "although some work in this direction has already appeared in the literature for the lisa mission and based on the use of the `` null - stream '' data combination @xcite , further work is still needed .",
    "it is within this perspective that the present article proposes a new approach to this problem based on the use of the auto - correlation function .",
    "our method provides a statistic for enhancing the likelihood of detection of a gw stochastic background with a single detector . as we will show below",
    ", the resulting snr is comparable to that obtainable by cross - correlating the data from two co - located and co - aligned detectors whose noises are assumed uncorrelated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ auto ]",
    "we derive the expression of the snr associated with the auto - correlation function of the data , estimated at an off - set time @xmath1 that is longer than the coherence time of the instrumental noise but shorter than that of the stochastic background . after noticing",
    "that the snr can be further enhanced by introducing a weighting function , @xmath2 , in the auto - correlation function , we derive the expression for @xmath3 that results into an optimal snr . finally in section [ conclusions ] we present our comments and conclusions , and emphasize that our auto - correlation technique can be applied not only to the data from a forthcoming space - based interferometers , but also to those from a network of ground - based interferometers and pulsar timing .",
    "let us denote with @xmath4 the time - series of the detector output data , which we will assume to include a random process , @xmath5 , associated with the noise and also a random process associated with a gw stochastic background , @xmath6 , in the following form @xmath7 in what follows we will assume the gw stochastic background to be an unpolarized , stationary , and gaussian random process with zero mean . as a consequence of these assumptions such",
    "a background is characterized by a one - sided power spectral density , @xmath8 defined by the following expression @xcite @xmath9 where the symbol @xmath10 represents the operation of fourier transform , the @xmath11 symbol denotes the usual operation of complex conjugation , and the angle - brackets , @xmath12 , denote the operation of ensemble average of the random process .",
    "we will further assume @xmath13 to be stationary , gaussian distributed with zero - mean , and characterized by a one - sided power spectral density , @xmath14 , defined as follows @xmath15    let us denote with @xmath16 and @xmath17 the coherence time of the gw stochastic background and of the instrumental noise respectively , and let us also assume @xmath18 .",
    "this assumption is rather general since , by being true for white noise and any colored gw background , it must remain true in general as the data can always be pre - whitened .",
    "the sample auto - correlation function , @xmath19 , of the data , @xmath4 , can be written in the following form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the time interval in seconds over which the auto - correlation is computed .",
    "the interval of interest for our method is when @xmath22 ; in this region the instrumental noise has decorrelated , leaving the correlation function of the signal .",
    "figure  [ figure : cartoon ] shows the situation schematically .",
    "this signal correlation then competes with the estimation error statistics of the correlation function for detection , as discussed below . very similarly to the cross - correlation technique discussed in @xcite we can rely on @xmath23 for building a decision rule for the detection of a gw stochastic background .    from the statistical properties of both the gw stochastic background and the noise , and by taking into account the central - limit theorem ( for @xmath24 , @xmath25 is equal to the sum of many uncorrelated products ) it follows that @xmath25 is also a gaussian random process @xcite . in order to fully characterize it we can estimate its mean and variance , which must be functions of only the spectra of the two random processes @xmath6 and @xmath26 .    by taking the ensemble average of @xmath27 and @xmath28 over many noise and gw signal realizations and for @xmath29 , after some long but straightforward calculations we get the following expressions for the mean and variance of @xmath19 ( see appendix [ appendixa ] for details ) ) can also be derived from the equation for the estimation error of the auto - correlation function given in jenkins and watts @xcite ( eq .",

    "we show that also for the auto - correlation technique there exists such a filter .",
    "since the stochastic background and the instrumental noise have been assumed to be stationary , we introduce a time - invariant filter function and write the following linear combination of all possible sample auto - correlation functions lags @xmath45 where the auto - correlation is computed over the time interval @xmath21 , and the filter function @xmath2 at the time - lag @xmath1 is non - zero in the interval @xmath46 and zero everywhere else ( a property that we have already taken into account in eq .",
