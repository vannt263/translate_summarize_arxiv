    "one of the most interesting properties of nonlinear wave equations is the development of singularities in finite time for solutions starting from smooth initial data . in a typical situation one",
    "observes that small initial data lead to dispersion whereas for large data the solution ceases to exist after a finite time by forming a singularity .",
    "an interesting mathematical question in this respect concerns the nature of the breakdown for generic large data solutions .",
    "it turns out that singularity formation is often connected to the existence of special solutions .",
    "in particular , for certain systems it has been observed that the breakdown occurs via a self  similar solution : generic large data evolutions approach a certain self  similar solution and blow up .",
    "such a knowledge is often based on numerical studies .",
    "we remark that the convergence to the special solution is due to dispersion and can in general only hold in a local sense since the total energy is conserved .",
    "obviously , the stability of special solutions plays a crucial role for understanding the dynamics .    as a first step in the analysis of such a system one studies linear stability of the solution which is expected to act as an attractor .",
    "however , unlike in the case of static solutions , the linearization around a self  similar solution yields an equation which depends explicitly on time .",
    "an elegant way to overcome this difficulty is to introduce adapted coordinates which transform the problem of self  similar blow up into an asymptotic stability problem .",
    "such similarity coordinates have been successfully used by various authors ( e.g. ref . ,",
    "ref . , ref .",
    ", ref . , ref . , ref . ) to study self  similar blow up behaviour for the semilinear wave equation .",
    "the main motivation of the present paper is to obtain a systematic functional analytic initial value formulation of the wave equation in similarity coordinates . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the radial case .",
    "the main difficulty one encounters is the fact that the spatial part of the wave operator in similarity coordinates is not normal .",
    "therefore , standard spectral theory is not applicable .",
    "however , we are still able to obtain a well  posed initial value formulation by means of semigroup theory .",
    "this approach leads to interesting non self ",
    "adjoint spectral problems .",
    "in particular , we show that the generator of the semigroup possesses a continuum of eigenvalues filling a complex left half plane . as an application we consider the wave equation with a power nonlinearity where we study the linearization around the fundamental self  similar solution and show that it is linearly stable .",
    "this is achieved by a detailed study of the spectrum of the associated linear operator .",
    "this operator has exactly one unstable eigenvalue which is shown to emerge from the time translation symmetry of the orginal problem .",
    "we get rid of this instability by defining an appropriate projection that removes the unstable eigenvalue from the spectrum .",
    "then we show that the resulting operator generates a semigroup and by analysing its resolvent we deduce appropriate growth bounds to conclude linear stability of the fundamental self  similar solution .",
    "the framework developed in the present work is fundamental for the follow  up papers ref . and ref . where the full nonlinear stability of the fundamental self  similar solution is proved",
    "throughout this paper we will make use of the following notations . for a hilbert space @xmath0",
