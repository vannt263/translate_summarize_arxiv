    "in the current standard cosmological model , two unknown components govern the dynamics of the universe : dark matter ( dm ) , responsible for structure formation , and dark energy ( de ) , that drives cosmic acceleration . recently ,",
    "an alternative point of view has started to attract considerable interest . according to it , dm and de",
    "are simply different manifestations of a single unifying dark - matter / energy ( udm ) component .",
    "since it is assumed that there is only one dark component in the universe , besides ordinary matter , photons and neutrinos , udm is also referred to as quartessence @xcite .",
    "a prototype candidate for such unification is the quartessence chaplygin model ( qcm ) @xcite .",
    "although this model is compatible with the background data @xcite , problems appear when one considers ( adiabatic ) perturbations .",
    "for instance , the cmb anisotropy is strongly suppressed when compared with the @xmath3cdm model @xcite .",
    "further , it was shown that the matter power spectrum presents oscillations and instabilities that reduce the parameter space of the model to a region very close to the @xmath3cdm limit @xcite .",
    "however , these oscillations and instabilities in the matter power spectrum and the cmb constraints can be circumvented by assuming silent perturbations @xcite , i.e. , intrinsic entropy perturbations with a specific initial condition ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "in fact , silent perturbations solve the matter power spectrum problem for more generic quartessence @xcite .",
    "efforts to solve the mater power spectrum problem have also been put forward in @xcite and @xcite . however , we understand that these works are not , strictly speaking , quartessence .",
    "in fact , @xcite introduces what seems to be a particular splitting of the chaplygin model .",
    "it is a two component system although only one component is perturbed . a way to implement silent perturbations",
    "is presented in @xcite , but they use additional fields that can be interpreted as new matter components .    in this work we present a possible alternative to solve the above mentioned problems in the context of the more standard adiabatic perturbations scenario .",
    "we shall discuss a model in which the quartessence eos changed its concavity in some instant in the past .",
    "we focus our investigation on models with a step - like shape eos .",
    "we show that , in order to be in accordance with observations , the eos concavity change would have occurred at high redshifts .",
    "similarly to what happens in the chaplygin case , observations constrain one of the parameters of the model to such a low value that , at least at zero and first orders , the step - like model can not be observationally distinguished from the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "in the quartessence models explicitly analyzed up to now , the eos is convex , i.e. , is such that @xmath8 stability for adiabatic perturbations and adiabatic sound speed less than @xmath9 imply @xmath10 condition ( [ stab ] ) and the fact that @xmath11 immediately implies the existence of a minimum energy density @xmath12 , once the energy conservation equation is used .",
    "this is a generic result for any uncoupled fluid model in which @xmath13 .",
    "it implies that the @xmath14 line can not be crossed and that in any such a quartessence model the minimum value of the eos parameter is @xmath15 . the convexity condition ( [ convex ] )",
    "implies that @xmath16 occurs at @xmath17 .",
    "this last result is only a consequence of the convexity of the eos . in this case , the epoch of accelerated expansion is also a period of high adiabatic sound speed , causing the oscillations and suppressions in the power spectrum .",
    "however , this property is not mandatory for quartessence .",
    "models with concavity changing equations of state may have @xmath2 negligibly small at @xmath18 . as we shall show , it is possible to build models in which a non - negligible @xmath2 is a transient phenomenon and relevant only at a very early epoch , such that only perturbations with relatively large wave numbers ( outside the range of current linear power spectrum measurements ) are affected .",
    "the step - like quartessence , given by a sigmoid , is an example of udm with concavity changing eos ( see figure [ pxro ] , left panel ) , @xmath19}\\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{sig}\\ ] ] for this model , the adiabatic sound speed has the following expression , @xmath20 } { \\left\\ { 1+\\exp\\left[\\beta\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m^{4}}-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\right)\\right]\\right\\ } ^{2}}. \\label{sigspeed}\\ ] ] there are three free parameters in the model .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is related to the minimum value of the energy density , i.e. , the value of @xmath22 when the asymptotic eos , @xmath23 , is reached .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is related to the value of the energy density at the transition from the @xmath4 regime to the @xmath25 one ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "notice that if @xmath27 , the transition takes place well before the minimum density is reached .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 controls the maximum sound velocity @xmath29 as well as the redshift width of the transition region ( higher values of @xmath28 implying faster transitions ) . for the sigmoid eos",
    "the maximum adiabatic sound speed is given by @xmath30 , and therefore we require @xmath31 .    in the present model , the @xmath3cdm limit is not necessarily associated with the maximum sound speed , in contrast to what is found in the convex eos case .",
    "the @xmath3cdm limit is reached when @xmath32 , which implies @xmath33 .",
    "another possibility is to take @xmath34 . in this case",
    "@xmath35 and we also have a @xmath3cdm limit , but now with @xmath36 . since @xmath28 strongly affects the redshift width of the transition , these two limits have different characteristics .",
    "the case of a nonvanishing @xmath37 has a drastic effect on the matter power spectrum .",
    "in fact , although the maximum sound speed will be small , it will be non negligible during a long redshift range and/or time , practically ruling out these models .",
    "we note that a step - like quartessence may be represented by the more generic expression , @xmath38,\\label{step}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a step - like function , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the maximum adiabatic sound speed is @xmath42 . for @xmath27 , @xmath43 .",
    "the zeroth order quantities ( such as the luminosity and angular diameter distances ) , depend only on integrals of the hubble parameter .",
    "therefore , they are not very sensitive to local features of the function @xmath44 . in particular , they should not depend on the specific form of the transition from @xmath45to @xmath46 .",
    "for example , for small values of @xmath24 , the observational data ( from snia , for instance ) constrains only @xmath47 and not @xmath24 nor @xmath28 .",
    "thus we expect the background observational constraints to be highly degenerate for small @xmath24 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "further , as will be shown , first order tests , such as cosmic microwave background fluctuations or large - scale structure data , constrain the value of @xmath24 to be very small ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "therefore , a real step function is a good model independent approximation for the background evolution in the type of quartessence we are dealing with in this paper .",
    "+    in the following we derive constraints on the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath49 from four data sets : snia , x - ray cluster gas mass fraction , galaxy power spectrum and cmb fluctuations . here , @xmath50 is the present value of the quartessence energy density . for the sake of simplicity , in our computations we fixed the parameter @xmath28 to the intermediary value @xmath51 .",
    "we remark that , for small values of @xmath24 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the present equation of state parameter .",
    "it is worth pointing out that @xmath53 should not be compared to the usual dark energy eos @xmath54 but with @xmath55 . in a flat universe and neglecting the small amount of baryons @xmath56 .",
    "values around @xmath57 are therefore to be expected .    in our snia analysis",
    "we use the `` gold '' data set of riess _",
    "_ @xcite . to determine the likelihood of the parameters we follow the same procedure described in @xcite assuming flat priors when marginalizing over the baryon density parameter @xmath58 and hubble parameter @xmath59 . for the galaxy cluster analysis",
    ", we use the _ chandra _ measurements of the x - ray gas mass fraction data from allen _ et al .",
    "again , we follow the same procedure described in @xcite to determine confidence region of the parameters of the model .",
    "we first marginalize analytically over the bias @xmath60 , using a gaussian prior with @xmath61 and then , as in the snia analysis , we marginalize over @xmath58 and @xmath59 assuming flat priors . in figure [ snecluster ]",
    "we show constant 68% and 95% confidence levels contours on the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath24 for snia and x - ray galaxy clusters . from the figure it is clear that ,",
    "as expected , background tests impose only weak constraints on the parameter @xmath24 .    in order to obtain constraints on @xmath49 and @xmath24 from cmb data @xcite",
    "we follow the procedure described in @xcite , fixing @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and marginalizing over the other parameters , namely , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , the spectral index @xmath65 , the optical depth @xmath66 and the normalization @xmath67 . in figure [ 1order ] (",
    "left panel ) we show the confidence region on the parameters for cmb .",
    "note that @xmath24 plays a decisive role in the evolution of perturbations ; now the data constrain this parameter to be @xmath68 .",
    "we next consider the matter power spectrum , comparing the baryon spectrum with data from sdss @xcite . to compute the likelihood",
    ", we used a version of the code provided by m. tegmark @xcite , cutting at @xmath69mpc@xmath70 ( @xmath71 bands ) and marginalizing over @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath65 and the amplitude . in figure [ 1order ]",
    "( right panel ) we show the 68% and 95% confidence levels on @xmath24 and @xmath49 from the sdss power spectrum .",
    "this is the most restrictive test we have considered in this work , implying that @xmath72 .    in figure [ comb ]",
    "we display the constant ( 68% and 95% ) contours for the combined analysis snia + x - ray galaxy clusters + matter power spectrum + cmb data .",
    "our final result ( @xmath73 ) is @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the transition redshift from a pressureless epoch to a constant negative pressure period is given by @xmath76^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "therefore , assuming @xmath77 and since @xmath78 the transition from @xmath79 to @xmath46 would have occurred at @xmath80 .",
    "in this work we presented a new adiabatic quartessence model characterized by a change of concavity in the eos .",
    "we obtained the constraints on the model parameters from snia , x - ray gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters , cmb and matter power spectra and showed that the model is viable if @xmath78 .",
    "the redshift of the transition from the regime @xmath4 to @xmath81 is , therefore , @xmath6 . on the other hand , the inclusion of matter power spectrum data for smaller scales ( @xmath82 h mpc@xmath70 ) could impose stronger constraints upon @xmath24 pushing the minimum redshift of the transition to higher values .",
    "we checked that this is , in fact , the case by considering data from the matter power spectrum from the lyman - alpha forest @xcite .",
    "however , since there are still systematic uncertainties in this data we did not include them in our analysis .",
    "although differences between quartessence models and @xmath3cdm may exist in the nonlinear regime @xcite , the results of the present work , in combination with the results of @xcite and @xcite , indicate that , at zero and first orders , any ( convex or not ) successful adiabatic quartessence model can not be observationally distinguished from @xmath3cdm .",
