    "in the topological approach to graph coloring , initiated by lovsz proof @xcite of the kneser conjecture  @xcite , lower bounds on the _ chromatic number _ @xmath0 of a graph @xmath1 are obtained by exploiting topological invariants of a simplicial or cell complex @xmath2 that is associated with  @xmath1 .",
    "there are several standard constructions that associate a topological space @xmath2 with a graph  @xmath1 , e.g. , the ( simplicial ) neighborhood complex @xmath3 of lovsz @xcite , the ( simplicial ) box complex @xmath4 of matouek and ziegler @xcite , and , with respect to a reference graph @xmath5 , the ( cellular ) hom complex @xmath6 of lovsz ( cf .",
