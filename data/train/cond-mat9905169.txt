    "one of the pillars of modern physics is the covariance of theories under certain group actions . what is particular to a given application , such as initial and boundary conditions usually breaks the symmetries of the theory .",
    "the symmetry group of observed data is therefore usually much smaller than the covariance group of the theory .",
    "an example is hydrodynamics where the equations are invariant under space - time translation and scaling , but where the solutions are not , in general , invariant . for theories that are covariant under scaling ( to be specific",
    ", we can think of navier - stokes or korteweg - de vries equation ) the situation is clear : the scaling properties , such as the spectral decomposition of the solution at each time are given by the scaling properties of the initial condition , the boundary conditions and external forces .",
    "the study of scaling transformation properties in the domain of economics and finance is more complicated because the evolution equations ( or even the theory ) governing the dynamics are largely unknown .",
    "it is thus not possible , in this case , to separate these scaling properties into a general property of an underlying theory and into what is particular to the situation under study .",
    "the observed financial chronological data results at least to some extent , of the particularities of each market and not only from a general abstract dynamics .",
    "therefore there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect the data to exhibit simple properties under scaling transformation . keeping this simple observation in mind",
    ", we will base our analysis of the scaling transformation on methods adapted to physical systems with complex behavior : + i ) multifractal analysis of fully turbulent systems introduced in @xcite and within that approach further developed inversion techniques developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "tick by tick data are irregularly spaced in recorded time . to obtain price values at a regular time ,",
    "we use linear interpolation between the two recorded time that immediately precede and follow the regular time .",

    "our data base consist of the daily registers to which a constant has been subtracted such that the value at 10 am is equal to the value of the previous day at 5 pm .",
    "the subtracted jump process ( with jumps at fixed times ) can be analyzed on its own .",
    "this separation allows for a finer analysis of the rest of the process .    using these data sets",
    ", we obtained three new results .",
    "first , the scaling transformation of the moments of the observed probability distribution is a non - linear representation that is well approximated by a linear representation , for small scaling parameters .",
    "this linear representation turns out to be diagonal .",
    "secondly , the function of the order of the moment , defined by the spectrum of the generator is ( non trivially ) concave .",
    "this shows , by definition @xcite , that the data are multifractal .",
    "note that the concavity in the case of fx market ( dm/@xmath0 ) can partially be deduced from @xcite and is confirmed , independently of our work , by @xcite .",
    "our third new result is an explicit expression of the family of probability distributions of price increments corresponding to different time increments .    for larger values of the scaling parameter ,",
    "the linear approximation breaks down and the non linear terms of the representation has to be considered .",
    "the analysis of this letter can also be applied to the sp 500 index , where the results should be compared to the ( unifractal ) scaling behavior found in @xcite .",
    "it should also be compared with the , from the point of view of finance , more fundamental approach of stochastic time transformation ( subordinate processes ) that were applied to sp500 @xcite @xcite .",
    "these points are left for future investigations .",
    "we suppose that the financial variable is described by a stochastic process @xmath5 such that the set of increments @xmath6 , @xmath7 has a well defined transformation property under scaling of the time increment @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "to avoid complications , irrelevant for the quite crude application reported in this letter , we suppose that @xmath5 is stationary .",
    "moreover , we will only consider the absolute value @xmath11 of increments .",

    "a group action @xmath16 of the scaling ( dilatation ) group @xmath17 ( the set of strictly positive real numbers ) on the set @xmath18 is then defined ,",
    "i.e @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the identity element in @xmath17 . in the cases under consideration in this letter , it follows from the observed time series that the estimated probability distribution @xmath23 in @xmath24 of @xmath25 is different for different @xmath26 .",
    "this is enough to ensure the existence of the action @xmath16 , and moreover shows that @xmath16 gives a group action @xmath27 , on the set @xmath28 of probability distributions , defined by @xmath29 .",
    "the group action @xmath27 is not linear , in spite of its appearance . to explicit properties of the scaling action @xmath27 , we change the coordinates of the elements in @xmath30 . as in the case of fully developed turbulence",
    ", we use the moments as coordinates . for @xmath31 , let the moment vector be the sequence @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here we suppose that the set @xmath30 of probability measures is such that @xmath35 exists for all orders @xmath36 and moreover that @xmath37 is determined by its moments of order @xmath34 ( which is the case if for example the fourier transform of elements in @xmath30 are quasi analytic ) .",
    "let @xmath38 be the image ( in the space @xmath39 of continuous real functions on @xmath40 ) of @xmath30 under the coordinate transformation @xmath41 .",
    "the image @xmath42 of the group action @xmath27 is given by @xmath43 , i.e @xmath44 .",

    "an accurate and explicit approximation of the inverse transformation @xmath55 , of the moment vectors @xmath56 to probability distribution @xmath23 has been developed in @xcite @xcite @xcite . this permits to obtain directly from experimental data , an explicit formula for the family @xmath57 of probabilities .",
