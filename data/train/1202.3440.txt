    "whereas their copious x - ray emission suggests a central cooling time much less than the hubble time , galaxy cluster cores do not exhibit cooling flows commensurate with their radiative losses .",
    "absent are the mass deposition rates ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) and copious iron line emission that would accompany such flows . instead",
    ", the central temperatures of cool core clusters are typically only @xmath4@xmath5 of the bulk cluster temperatures , while spectroscopically determined mass deposition rates are @xmath0@xmath6 ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "understanding how these conditions are maintained in the face of rapid radiative cooling poses a challenge for theorists , who have consequently invoked a plethora of diverse physics to resolve the problem .",
    "these include : active galactic nucleus feedback , conductive heat transport , and convective turbulence , whether it be driven by cosmic rays , mergers , or magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instabilities .    this paper concerns the contribution of conductive heat transport to the solution of the cooling flow problem .",
    "however , we do not take the usual energetics standpoint ( i.e. does conduction provide an ample source of heat to offset radiative losses ? ) but rather focus on how conduction generates , and is subsequently modified by , plasma instabilities and the mhd turbulence they instigate . because the intracluster medium ( icm ) is magnetized and weakly collisional it exhibits surprising stability properties @xcite .",
    "in particular , the outwardly increasing temperature profile of a cluster core gives rise to a heat - flux buoyancy - driven instability ( hbi ; * ? ? ? * ) that can drive disordered flows .",
    "numerical simulations show that these flows lead to near - complete field - line insulation of the core , and heat conduction is greatly impeded @xcite .",
    "hbi motions not only seem incapable of maintaining the observed temperature profile ( as suggested by @xcite ) , but actually exacerbate the cooling flow problem . as a result",
    ", theorists have appealed to turbulent stirring by other means to reopen the field lines and reinstate the conductive heat - flux @xcite .",
    "this would bring the issue to a close if it were not for the fact that a magnetized , weakly collisional plasma can exhibit appreciable pressure anisotropy  an effect neglected in most previous work .",
    "in fact , hbi modes inevitably generate such anisotropies , manifested as viscous stresses , and these adversely affect the instability mechanism . in particular , the wavelengths of the fastest growing modes @xmath7 increase from very small scales to those of order the thermal - pressure scaleheight of the cluster @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "so , even though the hbi mechanism can be understood with local physics , the instability manifests primarily on _ global _ scales and may be sensitive to the large - scale structure of the cluster , especially via the kinematic viscosity s strong dependence on temperature and density .",
    "for this reason , @xcite conjectured , on account of a wkbj analysis , that the fastest growing hbi modes would favour only the innermost regions of the cluster core , as it is here that viscous damping is minimised .",
    "if the nonlinear saturation of the hbi is similarly confined , then the associated field - line insulation of the core may be significantly attenuated .    in this paper , we investigate how pressure anisotropy and the global structure of the icm influence the hbi by generalising the linear calculation of @xcite .",
    "we calculate the hbi modes in a simple quasi - global model of the cluster : a plane - parallel atmosphere .",
    "the model captures the radial density and temperature structure of the icm , but neglects its angular structure .",
    "though idealized , this model permits us to test in a transparent way the new physics at work , and how the character of the hbi changes in a global setting . in addition , it provides a numerical testbed for nonlinear codes that include anisotropic conduction and viscosity .",
    "our main result is that the dominant hbi modes are typically localised to the innermost ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) regions of cool - core clusters .",
    "it is then likely that , in the nonlinear regime , appreciable field - line insulation will similarly localise and become inefficient .",
    "these theoretical results have been corroborated by the braginskii - mhd simulations presented in @xcite , which use domains sufficiently large to capture this physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formulation ] we present the model and its governing equations . in section [ sec : equilibrium ]",
    "we derive quasi - global equilibrium solutions to these equations , which are then subjected to linear perturbations in section [ sec : linearshit ] .",
    "there , the hbi eigenmodes are calculated numerically , presented , and discussed .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] with a speculative discussion of the implications our results have for the long - term thermal and dynamic stability of cool - core galaxy clusters .",
    "the macroscopic scales of the icm ( e.g. the thermal - pressure scale height @xmath8 ) are much greater than the particle mean free path @xmath9 and thus a ( collisional ) mhd description of the icm plasma remains valid . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath9 is much larger than the ion gyroradius , a physical regime that ensures the predominance of cyclotronic motions . as a consequence ,",
    "the transport properties of the plasma deviate significantly from what we might expect from classical mhd .",
    "for instance , the conduction of heat is strongly anisotropic with respect to the local magnetic field direction , a property that fundamentally alters the icm s convective stability @xcite .",
    "temperature gradients , rather than entropy gradients , become the discriminating quantities that determine stability , regardless of whether temperature increases @xcite or decreases @xcite in the direction of gravity . in addition , the fluid is subject to pressure anisotropies , i.e. the gas pressure perpendicular @xmath10 and parallel @xmath11 to the local magnetic field may not be equal .",
    "pressure anisotropies arise from the conservation of the first and second adiabatic invariants of each particle .",
    "these ensure that any change in magnetic field strength @xmath12 and/or density @xmath13 must be accompanied by corresponding changes in @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the pressure anisotropy impinges noticeably on the buoyancy instabilities that afflict stratified plasmas , such as the magnetothermal instability ( mti ) and the hbi . because the anisotropy impedes the convergence and divergence of magnetic field lines , the mti mechanism is strengthened , while the hbi is suppressed . in particular , pressure anisotropy shifts the fastest - growing hbi modes to much longer wavelengths than the very short scales it was thought to favour .",
    "in fact , @xcite finds that the fastest growth occurs for a wavelength @xmath14 , which in the weakly collisional icm is approximately global , @xmath15@xmath8 .",
    "these longer modes operate on a timescale slower than conduction but faster than viscous diffusion ; thus they can effectively access free energy via the heat - flux , while minimising viscous damping .",
    "pressure anisotropies also give rise to a host of ` microinstabilities ' , which include the firehose , mirror , and gyrothermal instabilities @xcite .",
    "these generate turbulent fluctuations on ` nano - scales ' of @xmath4@xmath16 and @xmath4@xmath17 , which likely set the pressure anisotropy and heat - fluxes on the larger scales that the hbi inhabits @xcite .",
    "ideally , these fluctuations would be ` smoothed out ' by a mean field theory or else accounted for in some fashion . in this work",
    "we assume from the outset that our plasma is maxwellian , and so these instabilities do not appear in our linear theory ( though they may during the nonlinear phase of the evolution ) .",

    "we consider a hydrogenic plasma with equal ion and electron number densities , @xmath39 , and temperatures , @xmath40 .",

    "may be written as @xmath48 where we have introduced the ( kinematic ) viscosity coefficient @xmath49 this pressure anisotropy is the physical effect behind what is known as @xcite viscosity  the restriction of the viscous damping to the motions and gradients parallel to the magnetic field .",

    "we hence employ an intermediate model , the plane - parallel atmosphere ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , used frequently in stellar convection problems @xcite .",
    "this is an idealised physical system , but one that can help isolate features associated with a cluster s global radial structure while evading the uncertainties and analytic difficulties of magnetic field configurations in spherical geometry .",

    "finally , the horizontal wavenumber @xmath121 ranges between 0 and 1000 .      on account of the finite vertical domain of the layer ,",
    "there are a discrete number of hbi modes each with a distinct vertical structure , as opposed to the @xmath160 continuum exhibited by the local model .",
    "the fastest growing of these modes undergo the least vertical variation ( corresponding roughly to smaller @xmath160 in the local analysis ) , while the slowest growing modes exhibit much finer - scale structure ( larger @xmath160 ) .    in fig .",

    "this wave configuration maximizes convergence / divergence of the background heat - flux and the consequent heating / cooling of the plasma .",
    "modes on arbitrarily small horizontal scales grow at the maximum rate , and so the system is ill - posed unless these small scales are regularised via the inclusion of finite larmor radius ( flr ) effects , for example .",
    "conversely , most modes are extinguished for sufficiently small @xmath121 ( long horizontal wavelengths ) : an hbi mode ceases to grow efficiently when its horizontal wavelength becomes much longer than its characteristic vertical scale .",

    "greater magnetic tension ( lower @xmath134 ) also lowers the maximum growth rate .",
    "unstable hbi modes can exhibit either monotonic or oscillatory growth analogous to magnetoconvection in a finite layer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "interestingly , in a radiatively cooling atmosphere growing modes tend to favour the oscillatory form .",
    "cooling accentuates local perturbations in @xmath116 and thus reinforces the oscillatory response of the perturbed heat - flux .                  in fig .",

    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , because the hbi growth rate is proportional to @xmath179 , these modes take advantage of the steeper temperature gradient at small @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , the local growth rate is a factor @xmath180 less at the top of the layer than it is at the bottom .",
    "second , because the kinematic viscosity is @xmath181 , the higher temperatures and lower densities characteristic of the upper portion of the atmosphere guarantee rapid viscous damping of wavelengths significantly smaller than the local thermal - pressure scale height .",
    "this is also the cause of the relatively straight field lines for @xmath182 for all of the shown eigenmodes . as a consequence of these two effects , the degree of confinement depends on the parameters @xmath183 and @xmath140 .",
    "we find that the fraction of the atmosphere perturbed by the fastest growing mode scales like @xmath184 for @xmath185 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath140 here coincides , unsurprisingly , with the hbi s favoured vertical wavelength in the local analysis @xcite .",
    "slower growing modes ( not shown ) exhibit greater variation ( i.e. more nodes ) and extend farther into the atmosphere . yet",
    "only the very slowest modes exhibit significant perturbations throughout the entire layer .",
    "for example , a typical e - folding time for the growth of substantial magnetic structures at large @xmath61 is @xmath186@xmath187 , an order of magnitude longer than the peak e - folding time .",
    "consequently , it is unlikely that such modes are dynamically important during the nonlinear saturation of the hbi .",

    "thus both the free energy source and the catalyst for instability are diminished . to compensate , the mode ` spreads out ' to access as much energy as viscous damping permits .",

    "because of numerical dissipation on the grid , at @xmath194 the numerical growth rates abruptly depart from the theoretical prediction and drop precipitously .",
    "at which @xmath121 this ` unphysical ' regularisation occurs depends entirely on the resolution adopted , and formally such simulations can never be resolved . in practice , however , it is unclear how many of these small - scale hbi modes are actually required to adequately describe the nonlinear dynamics of the system . also unclear",
    "is whether the grid regularisation realistically approximates regularisation by flr effects , and if this matters in the saturated state .",
    "some of these issues are addressed in @xcite .    ) and the numerical dispersion relation ( asterisks ; obtained from run h2dbrag of @xcite for the two fastest - growing modes .",
    "the parameters of the system are : @xmath92 , @xmath114 , @xmath158 , and @xmath195,width=240 ]",
    "in this paper we have examined the linear stability of weakly collisional , thermally stratified atmospheres in which the conduction of heat and the viscous dissipation of motions are anisotropic with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "such atmospheres are representative of those found in the cooling cores of non - isothermal galaxy clusters , which are subject to a heat - flux buoyancy - driven instability ( hbi )",
    ".    numerical simulations of the hbi have established that the instability acts in such a way as to disrupt the conductive flow of heat , ultimately insulating the core from the hot thermal bath at large radii . in the presence of appreciable radiative losses , a cooling flow inevitably develops unless turbulent stirring by other means can reopen the field lines and reinstate the conductive flux .",
    "the pressure anisotropies generated by the hbi play an important role in suppressing the instability by reducing growth rates and by shifting the fastest - growing modes to relatively long wavelengths . in the bulk of cool - core clusters , the collisionality is sufficiently low that these wavelengths become comparable to the thermal - pressure scale height of the gas .",
    "the hbi then operates on a global scale , and the analysis we have performed here marks one contribution towards understanding how the hbi changes in a global setting .",
    "our main result is that the low collisionality beyond @xmath4@xmath196 in typical cool - core clusters significantly impedes the otherwise disordered motions driven by the hbi . as a result",
    ", the magnetic - field lines can remain relatively straight over a significant fraction of the hubble time and the conductive flow of heat may proceed at an appreciable fraction of the spitzer value .",
    "near - complete field - line insulation due to the hbi could very well occur , but our analysis suggests that it is well - localised to the innermost regions of the cool core .",
    "this highlights the need for radio - mode feedback at these scales from a powerful central dominant galaxy .",
    "this conjecture is supported by recent numerical simulations of the hbi presented in @xcite , which self - consistently take into account the pressure anisotropy driven by the hbi and its adverse consequences for the instability s development .",
    "in contrast , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p12 ) perform analogous simulations of the hbi but these show that pressure anisotropy has little effect on the nonlinear saturation of the instability ; the hbi operates throughout the bulk of the cluster core unhampered and imposes significant field - line insulation throughout .",
    "these very different conclusions possibly arise from dissimilar parameters and models . in particular , the p12 simulations that employ a plane - parallel atmosphere are of very small vertical extent , typically @xmath197 . as a consequence ,",
    "there is insufficient room for global effects to come into play .",
    "these simulations can not exhibit the mode localisation that we emphasise .",
    "however , p12 also perform two spherical global simulations of the hbi in model cool - core clusters , and these support the results of their plane - parallel simulations . here",
    "the contradiction with our work is more puzzling , but probably arises from different parameters .",
    "for instance , p12 s icm model is far more collisional and less magnetised than ours , with @xmath198",
    ". the effective absence of magnetic tension in these simulations may be important as magnetic tension suppresses those shorter - scale ( local ) hbi modes that function throughout the core .",
    "alternatively , the discrepancy may be due to p12 s different initial magnetic - field geometry ( tangled on scales @xmath199@xmath196 ) or due to a basic dissimilarity between the spherical and plane - parallel geometries .",
    "but the apparent disagreement is a spur for future work : further three - dimensional simulations of cool - core clusters under representative conditions are needed .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate how convective instabilities influence heat conduction in the intracluster medium ( icm ) of cool - core galaxy clusters . </S>",

    "<S> our aim is to elucidate how the global structure of a cluster impacts on the growth and morphology of the linear hbi modes when in the presence of braginskii viscosity , and ultimately on the ability of the hbi to thermally insulate cores . </S>",
    "<S> we employ an idealised quasi - global model , the plane - parallel atmosphere , which captures the essential physics  </S>",
    "<S> e.g. the global radial profile of the cluster  while letting the problem remain analytically tractable . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is that the dominant hbi modes are localised to the innermost ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) regions of cool cores . </S>",
    "<S> it is then probable that , in the nonlinear regime , appreciable field - line insulation will be similarly localised . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while radio - mode feedback appears necessary in the central few tens of kpc , heat conduction may be capable of offsetting radiative losses throughout most of a cool core over a significant fraction of the hubble time . </S>",
