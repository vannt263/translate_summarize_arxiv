    "@xcite developed an univariate model for structural and ferro - magnetic applications .",
    "the bouc s formulation was similar to the one proposed by @xcite to represent hereditary phenomena .",
    "however , the clock - time in the volterra - stieltjes integrals was substituted by an _",
    "internal _ or _ intrinsic _ _ time_. the bouc model was modified by the contributions of several authors ; see , among others , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , leading to a more general class of models , hereafter named bouc - wen - type ( bw ) models .",
    "a further important modification concerned the introduction of the so - called strength and stiffness degradation effects , by means of suitable degradation functions @xcite .",
    "in fact , collapse assessment in earthquake engineering requires hysteretic models that include strength and stiffness deterioration properties @xcite .",
    "some general assumptions on the form of these functions were provided , e.g. they have to be positive and monotone , but no other limitation was mentioned .",
    "the resulting hysteresis models were extensively used in the seismic analysis of structural components , e.g. @xcite . moreover , the simplicity of bw models , due to the absence of an elastic domain , allowed their use in stochastic structural analysis .",
    "more recently , the bw models were used in applications of structural control , in particular in the modeling of the behavior of magneto - rheological dampers @xcite or other kinds of damping devices @xcite .",
    "moreover , several contributions of the last three decades were concerned with the identification of bw model parameters , for applications in seismic engineering ; e.g. @xcite .",
    "starting from a different viewpoint and independently from bouc , @xcite proposed the _",
    "endochronic ( ec ) theory of visco - plasticity _ , which postulates the existence of an intrinsic time governing the rate - independent evolution of stress and strain in materials , whereas the newtonian time is used to model the viscous behavior . in the case of plasticity without viscous effects , it was proven that flow rules can be formulated by using the mathematical formalism of pseudo - potentials . this was done for the standard ec theory by @xcite and for the ec theory with isotropic damage in the companion paper @xcite .",
    "a major question concerning the bw models is their thermodynamic admissibility .",
    "several criticisms were moved to these models as their formulation was not based on a proper thermodynamic approach .",
    "recently , this problem was analyzed by @xcite and @xcite for models without degradation terms . on the other hand , the typical constitutive laws of ec models are characterized by the absence of an elastic domain and the corresponding hysteresis loops are smooth and open , like in the bw models .",
    "for this reason several authors , among others , @xcite and @xcite , observed that a relationship must exist between ec and bw models . a formal proof that all the bouc - wen type models with a _ strength _",
    "degradation term admit an equivalent endochronic formulation was provided by @xcite .",
    "this was sufficient to prove that bw models with strength degradation are thermodynamically admissible , in the sense that they fulfill the second principle .",
    "nonetheless , a problem remains unsolved , viz .",
    "the formal proof of the thermodynamic admissibility of bw models endowed with a _ stiffness _ degradation term : this is the subject of the present paper . in this respect ,",
    "the endochronic theory with damage discussed in @xcite is used : it is proved that for every bw model with strength and stiffness degradation , an equivalent ec model with damage can be defined , i.e. a model exhibiting the same flow rules . therefore , the bw model is thermodynamically admissible if the corresponding ec model fulfills the second principle . exploiting the aforementioned equivalence ,",
    "the following results are derived too : ( i ) a rigorous thermodynamic definition of the plastic strain and of the dissipated energy for bw models exhibiting strength and stiffness degradation ; ( ii ) a new elasto - damaged bw model ; ( iii ) a bound for the stiffness degradation rate of bw models , proving that the traditional semi - empirical stiffness degradation laws , like the energetic linear rule or the so - called pivot rule , may lead to some pathological thermodynamic behavior ( these situations are illustrated by several numerical examples ) ; and ( iv ) an improved energetic stiffness degradation rule and a new stiffness degradation rule .    after the introduction in the first section , the existing bw models are reviewed in the first three parts of the second section , while a new class of stress - strain bw models with stiffness degradation is defined in the fourth part .",
    "the equivalence between the flow rules of bw models with both degradations and the ec theory with damage is discussed in the third section . in the fourth section ,",
    "single degree - of - freedom ( 1-dof ) and two - degrees - of - freedom ( 2-dof ) bw structural models are analyzed in detail , using the theoretical tools previously developed .",
    "this analysis is supplemented by some numerical examples and by an application to partial - strength beam - to - column steel joints .",
    "a classification of bouc - wen - type models is suggested in figure scheme_bw .",
    "the main distinction concerns non - degrading models ( nd - bw models ) and degrading ones . moreover , among degrading models , the further differentiation between d - bw models having only strength degradation and models characterized by strength and stiffness degradation or by stiffness degradation only ( dd - bw models ) is pointed out .",
    "then , the models formulated for describing the material behavior by stress - strain laws and the structural behavior by generalized force - displacement laws are distinguished .",
    "note that the box corresponding to _ stress - strain _ dd - bw models represents a new class of models , defined by equation ( [ bouc type ] ) . in this paper ,",
    "the equivalence between ec models with isotropic damage ( dd - ec ) , as defined in @xcite , and the stress - strain dd - bw models is proven and then used to provide a thermodynamically well - posed formulation for the dd - bw models .",
    "the stress - strain models described in this paper are presented only for a plastically incompressible behavior , since it is the most important case in the literature concerning stress - strain bw models .",
    "the treatment of the more general case , with a non - zero hydrostatic plastic flow , is conceptually similar , but requires a more complex formalism not needed here .      among the different models of hysteresis proposed by @xcite , the simplest one",
    "can be formulated by a stieltjes integral as follows : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a non - negative constant ; @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two time - dependent functions , which are considered as input and output functions , respectively . in structural engineering applications",

    "this situation is considered as non - admissible , since it is assumed that the energies dissipated by plasticity and damage must be _ separately _ increasing .",
    "a numerical simulation where this pathological situation occurs is presented in figures [ fig_degren1]a - c , where a 2-dof bw model with intrinsic time of kbc type is considered ; in detail , @xmath183 , @xmath202 @xmath185 , @xmath203 @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath139 .",
    "the strength degradation is governed by ( [ rules])@xmath85 with @xmath204 @xmath190 , while the stiffness degradation is given by ( [ rules])@xmath6 with @xmath205 @xmath190 .",
    "conversely , defining a stiffness degradation rule that depends linearly on the energy dissipated _ by plasticity _ @xmath206 the limit condition ( [ damcond1s])@xmath6 is always fulfilled .",
    "hence , for a stiffness degradation proportional to the _ plastic _ dissipated energy , no limitations are needed on @xmath100 . the numerical example illustrated in figures",
    "[ fig_degren1]d - f confirms this result .",
    "all the model parameters are the same used for the previous case .",
    "the _ pivot rule _ ( [ rulessiva])@xmath6 is sometimes used for modeling the cyclic behavior of structures ; see e.g. @xcite in this respect .",
    "some problems associated with this rule , occurring when it is applied with displacements histories with cycles of _ decreasing _ amplitude , were pointed out by @xcite .",
    "a bw model is considered here , with @xmath183 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath139 ( entailing @xmath209 ) and @xmath210 with @xmath211 .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 of the pivot rule is equal to @xmath212 . in this example , the same difficulties mentioned by @xcite appear , viz . the stiffness",
    "_ increases _ when the cycle amplitude decreases : see figure [ figpivot_vs_new]c .",
    "moreover , a deeper problem is also highlighted : even if the energy dissipated _ by plasticity _ and the _ total _ dissipated energy are non - decreasing , and the second principle is fulfilled , see figure [ figpivot_vs_new]d , this rule may entail _ negative _ damage increments , _ both _ during increasing and decreasing amplitude loops . as a result ,",
    "@xmath213 with a violation of ( [ damcond1s])@xmath85 , as shown in figures [ figpivot_vs_new]e , f .",
    "let us now compare the pivot rule to the stiffness degradation rule ( [ stiffnew1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ figpivot_vs_new]b shows that it is possible to choose the parameters for both rules in such a way to have almost identical force - displacement loops during an initial phase characterized by increasing displacement amplitude cycles . in the specific case considered in the figure , the new stiffness degradation rule ( [ stiffnew1 ] )",
    "is characterized by @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the damage evolution during this phase for both degradation laws is depicted in figure [ figpivot_vs_new]e : the new degradation rule entails a monotonic increase of damage , consistent with the assumption that dissipated energies by plasticity and damage _ separately _ increase ; while the pivot rule is characterized by phases with alternate increase and decrease of damage .",
    "then , decreasing amplitude loops are considered for both models and they provide very different behaviors , as illustrated in figure [ figpivot_vs_new]f : the rule ( [ stiffnew1 ] ) still entails an increase of damage , while the pivot rule induces an averaged decrease of damage , corresponding to an averaged increase of stiffness .",
    "a similar comparison can be made between the pivot rule and ( [ stiffenplast ] ) .",
    "figure [ figpivot_vs_enp ] shows the numerical results with @xmath216 the same remarks made for figure [ figpivot_vs_new ] hold : figure [ figpivot_vs_enp]d shows the evolution of the total dissipated energy for the case of the pivot rule ( thin line ) , the rule ( [ stiffenplast ] ) ( thick line ) and the rule ( [ stiffnew1 ] ) considered in the previous example ( dotted line ) .",
    "as expected , the pivot rule has a different evolution in the last part of the displacement history , where the stiffness increases instead of decreasing like for the other two rules .",
    "an application application of the bw model ( [ baberwen ] ) with the stiffness degradation ( [ stiffnew1 ] ) and the strength degradation @xmath217 , inspired to the rule ( [ rulessiva])@xmath85 is shown in figure [ fig_exp ] . in detail ,",
    "the experimental loops refer to a partial - strength beam - to - column steel joint , studied by @xcite .",

    ", we assumed @xmath232 .",
    "an attentive reader can observe that a good agreement between experimental ( figure [ fig_exp]b ) and numerical ( figure [ fig_exp]c , d ) hysteretic loops is obtained .",
    "in addition , the evolution of damage predicted by the model with the rule ( [ stiffnew1 ] ) and with the pivot rule is illustrated in figure [ fig_exp]e .",
    "again , the drawback of the pivot rule is evident . in summary",
    ", one can state that ( [ stiffnew1 ] ) and ( [ stiffenplast ] ) may be used as a valid alternative to the pivot rule to predict accurate loops ; furthermore , they represent a significant improvement in terms of thermodynamic admissibility .",
    "an exhaustive classification of bouc - wen - type models was provided in this paper .",
    "the models endowed with both strength and stiffness degradation were compared with an extended endochronic theory with isotropic damage .",
    "the thermodynamic formulation of this extended endochronic theory was discussed in a companion paper @xcite , using pseudo - potentials depending on state variables and on parameters related to the past history of the material . using this theoretical framework ,",
    "a rigorous thermodynamic definition of the energy dissipated by plasticity and damage was provided for bouc - wen models having both strength and stiffness degradation , as well as the definition of an elastic with damage bouc - wen model . moreover ,",
    "an important constraint on the stiffness degradation rules for bouc - wen models was highlighted and its consequences on the energetic linear rule were investigated .",
    "the non - monotonic damage evolution characterizing the pivot rule was illustrated .",
