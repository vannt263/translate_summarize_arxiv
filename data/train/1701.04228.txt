    "a spacetime singularity is expected to form as an end - state of a continual gravitational collapse and they potentially denote the breakdown of known laws of physics . though the general speculation is that an event horizon would form to shield this singular state from a distant observer , there are reasonable theoretical examples where no horizon can form and the singularity remains exposed , maybe forever , giving rise to what is known as a naked singularity @xcite .",

    "the case of a massless scalar field coupled to gravity is of particular interest in gravitational collapse as well as cosmological contexts .",
    "one of the major mechanisms for which scalar fields are thought to be responsible is the inflationary scenario @xcite .",
    "also , a scalar field with a variety of potential can mimic the evolution of many a kind of matter distribution as discussed by goncalves and moss @xcite .",
    "non - spherical models of scalar field collapse are there in literature @xcite , however , the more popular approach being the spherically symmetric collapse .",
    "a number of numerical and analytical work have been done in recent years on spherically symmetric massless scalar field collapse models from the perspective of cosmic censorship hypothesis @xcite .",
    "a zero mass scalar field collapse and the possibility of the formation of a naked singularity was discussed in a series of work by christodoulou @xcite . with the help of a numerical analysis , goldwirth and",

    "such a scalar field collapse with a power - law potential , without any apriori choice of equation of state , can lead to the formation of a central singularity which is cutoff from the exterior by an apparent horizon .",
    "the additional relevance of such investigations stems from the present importance of a scalar field as the dark energy @xcite , the agent responsible for the late time acceleration of the universe whose distribution remains an open aspect of investigation .",

    "a common functional form for the self - interaction potential is an exponential dependence upon the scalar field .",
    "a homogeneous isotropic cosmological model driven by a scalar field with an exponential potential was studied and a solution with power - law inflation was shown to be an attractor by halliwell @xcite .",
    "an exponential potential is predicted to be found in higher - order @xcite or higher - dimensional gravity theories @xcite .",
    "the cosmological nature of the universe filled with a scalar field , with an exponential potential , has been studied for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous scalar fields @xcite .",

    "it is straightforward to note that radius of the two - sphere @xmath48 goes to zero when @xmath49 , giving rise to a finite time zero proper volume singularity .",
    "+     for different values of @xmath50*,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   for different values of @xmath50*,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    [ fig : ltb ]    since , @xmath51 must always be real and positive , it is obvious that one must always choose positive values of @xmath50 .",
    "we plot the evolution of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath17 in figure @xmath52 for different values of @xmath50 . without any loss of generality ,",
    "one can assume @xmath53 .",
    "the choice of @xmath54 is restricted by the constraints developed from the boundary matching discussed in the next section .",
    "the spherical body , collapses with time almost uniformly until it reaches @xmath55 , where it hurries towards a zero proper volume singularity .",
    "this behavior is not affected by different choices of @xmath50 , only the scale of the time - interval changes .",
    "we have presented here two specific examples with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "+ one must look into the behavior of ricci and kretschmann curvature scalars to judge the nature of spacetime singularity .",
    "the curvature scalars can be written from the metric ( [ metricltb ] ) as    @xmath58,\\ ] ]    and @xmath59.\\ ] ]    using equation ( [ exactevo ] ) , the expressions for the scalars can be simplified into @xmath60 and @xmath61\\frac{1}{(t - t_0)^4}.\\ ] ]    one can clearly see , for all values of @xmath54 @xmath62 , both ricci and kretschmann scalar diverges to infinity when @xmath49 .",
    "therefore the collapsing sphere discussed here ends up in a curvature singularity .",
    "+ singularities formed in collapse can be shell focussing or shell crossing in nature . for a spherically symmetric collapse",
    "the shell focusing singularity occurs at @xmath63 .",
    "it is evident from ( [ metricltb ] ) and ( [ exactevo ] ) that @xmath64 when @xmath49 .",
    "thus the curvature singularity indeed is a shell - focussing one in nature .",
    "for a complete and consistent analysis of gravitational collapse , proper junction conditions are to be examined carefully which allow a smooth matching of an exterior geometry with the collapsing interior .",
    "any astrophysical object is immersed in vacuum or almost vacuum spacetime , and hence the exterior spacetime around a spherically symmetric star is well described by the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "moreover it was extensively shown by goncalves and moss @xcite that any sufficiently massive collapsing scalar field can be formally treated as collapsing inhomogeneous dust . from the continuity of the first and second differential forms , the matching of the sphere to a schwarzschild spacetime on the boundary surface , @xmath65 ,",
    "is extensively worked out in literature @xcite .",
    "+ however , conceptually this may lead to an inconsistency since the treatment allowed for a dust collapse may not be valid for a scalar field in general .",
    "for instance , since schwarzschild has zero scalar field , such a matching would lead to a discontinuity in the scalar field , which means a delta function in the gradient of the scalar field . as a consequence",
    ", there will appear square of a delta function in the stress - energy , which is definitely an inconsistency .",
    "in modified theories of gravity an alternative scenario is treated sometimes where the exterior is non - static , however , the solar system experiments constrain heavily such a scenario . another possible way to avoid such a scenario can perhaps be allowing jump in the curvature terms in the field equations , however , this must result in surface stress energy terms , which on realistic collapsing models must have observational signatures and can be established via experimental evidences @xcite .",
    "+ following references @xcite , we match the spherical ball of collapsing scalar field to a vaidya exterior across a boundary hypersurface defined by @xmath65 .",
    "the metric just inside @xmath65 is , @xmath66 and the metric in the exterior of @xmath65 is given by @xmath67 matching the first fundamental form on the hypersurface we get @xmath68 and @xmath69^{\\frac{1}{3{\\alpha_{0}}^2}}.\\ ] ] matching the second fundamental form yields , @xmath70 using equations ( [ cond1 ] ) , ( [ cond2 ] ) and ( [ cond3 ] ) one can write @xmath71 from equation ( [ cond3 ] ) one obtains @xmath72 matching the second fundamental form we can also write the derivative of @xmath73 as @xmath74 equations ( [ cond2 ] ) , ( [ dvdt2 ] ) , ( [ m ] ) and ( [ dm ] ) completely specify the matching conditions at the boundary of the collapsing scalar field .",
    "whether the ultimate spacetime singularity is visible to an exterior observer depends on the formation of an apparent horizon .",
    "such a surface is defined as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the proper radius of the collapsing sphere . using ( [ metricltb ] ) and ( [ exactevo ] )",
    ", one can express this equation as @xmath77 here , @xmath78 is a constant of separation .",
    "thus the time formation of apparent horizon can be expressed as @xmath79 both @xmath54 and @xmath51 depend on the choice of potential given their definitions @xmath80 and @xmath47 .",
    "the arbitrary constants @xmath39 and @xmath78 can be estimated from proper matching of the collapsing scalar field with an appropriate exterior geometry and on initial conditions . + from ( [ exactevo ] ) , one can write at @xmath81 , @xmath82 since we are dealing with a geometry where the sphere must always decrease in volume with respect to time , this expression is consistent iff @xmath83 .",
    "this means that the apparent horizon , if any , must always form before the formation of singularity .",
    "+ to determine the collapse outcome , one needs to find if nonspacelike trajectories emanate from the singularity and reach an observer .",
    "the singularity is at least locally naked if there are future directed nonspacelike curves that reach faraway observers . in the present case",
    "the time of formation of singularity @xmath43 is independent of @xmath84 and therefore is not a central singularity .",
    "the entire collapsing body reaches the singularity simulteneously at @xmath85 .",
    "this kind of singularity is always expected to be covered by the formation of an apparent horizon as already discussed by joshi , goswami and dadhich @xcite .",
    "the result that apparent horizon must always form before the formation of singularity , is therefore a consistent result .",
    "studies of exact solutions and their properties , symmetries , local geometries and singularities - play a non - trivial role in general relativity @xcite , even in the current context .",
    "finding non - trivial solutions to the einstein equations requires some reduction of the problem , which usually is done by exploiting symmetries or other properties . as a result",
    ", there is no single method preferred for finding solutions to the einstein equations .",
    "although many exact solutions exist , very few pose physically interesting results . from this point of view",
    ", investigations regarding a gravitational collapse when a scalar field is minimally coupled to gravity are already there in literature , but usually consisting of a massless scalar field .",
    "there are only very limited amount of work on massive scalar field collapse and that too in a very restricted scenario .",
    "we have discussed a spherically symmetric collapse of a massive scalar field where an exponential potential describes the self - interaction .",
    "the scalar field is chosen to be spatially homogeneous , representing the scalar field analogue of oppenheimer - snyder collapse @xcite .",
    "a systematic discussion is presented , assuming the matter contribution @xmath9 to be zero . following the approach introduced by harko et al @xcite in a cosmological context , the klein - gordon equation describing the dynamics of the scalar field",
    "is simplified considerably into a first order non - linear differential equation .",
    "a simple exact solution predicts the end state of the collapse to be a finite time shell - focusing singularity .",
    "the evolution of the system is found to be independent of different parameters defining the self - interacting potential @xmath80 . a proper boundary matching with an exterior vaidya geometry",
    "is discussed ensuring the consistency of the geometry .",
    "the visibility of the end - state is sensitive over different choices of initial conditions , as discussed in section @xmath3 .",
    "the collapse is simulteneous and results in a singularity which acts as a sink for all the curves of the collapsing congruence , and the volume elements shrink to zero along all the collapsing trajectories .",
    "an apparent horizon is always expected to form before the formation of zero proper volume singularity , which therefore remains hidden forever .",
    "the formalism presented here is indeed a very simple case , but can perhaps be interesting for pedagogical purposes .",
    "the reduction of the klein - gordon equation into a first order differential equation can be fairly useful in many cosmological contexts .",
    "exact and approximate solutions of massive scalar field collapse is an interesting subject and using this formalism the study can be expanded , for example for hyperbolic cosine potentials .",
    "approximate solutions can be constructed as well in the limiting cases of the scalar field kinetic energy and potential energy dominance .",
