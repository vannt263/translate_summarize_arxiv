    "v821cas ( bd + 52@xmath11 3571 , tycho 4001 - 1445 - 1 , v=8@xmath12.31 , ( b - v)=0.11 ) was discovered to be an eclipsing binary of early a spectral type , with a variability period of @xmath131.8 days by the hipparcos satellite ( esa , 1997 ) .",
    "deirmenci et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2007 ) determined an improved light curve and listed 25 photographic times of minima from which they derived an improved eclipse ephemeris .",
    "they obtained _ bvr _ light curves , and established that the orbit is eccentric from the displacement of the secondary minimum .",
    "its components do not show intrinsic variability , they are well - separated , and well within their roche lobes , which values them proper tests for stellar models .",
    "several times of minima for v821cas have appeared in the literature since , but no radial velocity measurements and multi - band light curves have been published . the aim of this work is to obtain the absolute parameters of the system . along the next section",
    "we first present our spectroscopic data and the set of _ ubvri _ light curves . making use of the spectra",
    "we determine the parameters of the radial velocity curve and perform a reliable estimation of the spectral types for both components .",
    "then , using the results from the spectroscopy together with the our photometric data we analyze the light curves to obtain reliable solutions that allow to determine the rest of the parameters of the system .",
    "we report here new photometry of v821cas in the bessell _ ubvri _ bands .",
    "the photometric accuracy and the phase coverage ( over 350 observations ) are sufficient to guarantee a reliable determination of the light curve parameters thus permitting a critical evaluation of stellar models .",
    "the observations were carried out with the 0.40-m telescope located on mt .",
    "bakirlitepe in september of 2007 at the tbitak national observatory ( tug , located in south of turkey ) .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a apogee 1k@xmath141k ccd ( binned 2@xmath142 ) and standard bessel _ ubvri",
    "_ filters .",
    "the instrument with attached camera provide a field - of - view of 11@xmath15.3@xmath1411@xmath15.3 . by placing v821cas very close to center of the ccd to get highest accuracy",
    ", we managed to strategically locate the binary on the chip together with two other stars of similar apparent magnitude .",
    "as comparison star we selected bd + 52@xmath113575 . the check star chosen to be bd + 52@xmath113580 .",
    "both stars passed respective tests for intrinsic photometric variability and proved to be stable during time span of our observations .",
    "we collected a total of 1600 points in the ubvri bands .",
    "the resulting v - band magnitude differences ( var - comp ) are listed in table 1 ( available in electronic form at the cds ) .",
    "a typical precision of the differential magnitudes is about 0.008 mag per measurement .",
    "standard iraf tasks were used to remove the electronic bias and to perform the flat - fielding corrections .",
    "the iraf task imalign was used to remove the differences in the pixel locations of the stellar images and to place all the ccd images on the same relative coordinate systems .",
    "the data were analyzed using another iraf task phot with no differential extinction effects taken into account given the relative small separation between the target and the comparison and check stars .",
    "the phase - folded light curves for the whole observations are shown in fig .",
    "5 with all bands .",
    "spectroscopic observations have been performed with the chelle spectrograph ( fresco ) at the 91-cm telescope of catania astrophysical observatory .",
    "the spectrograph is fed by the telescope through an optical fibre ( @xmath16@xmath17 , 100 @xmath18 m core diameter ) and is located , in a stable position , in the room below the dome level .",
    "spectra were recorded on a ccd camera equipped with a thinned back  illuminated site ccd of 1k@xmath141k pixels ( size 24@xmath1424 @xmath18 m ) .",
    "the cross - dispersed chelle configuration yields a resolution of about 20000 , as deduced from the full width at half maximum of the lines of the th  ar calibration lamp .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range from 4300 to 6650  , split into 19 orders . in this spectral region , and in particular in the blue portion of the spectrum , there are several lines useful for the measure of radial velocity , as well as for spectral classification of the stars .",
    "the data reduction was performed by using the chelle task of iraf package following the standard steps : background subtraction , division by a flat field spectrum given by a halogen lamp , wavelength calibration using the emission lines of a th - ar lamp , and normalization to the continuum through a polynomial fit .",
    "sixteen spectra of v821cas were collected during the 20 observing nights between august 2 and 23 , 2006 .",
    "typical exposure times for the v821cas spectroscopic observations were between 2400 and 2600 s. the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath19 ) achieved was between 70 and 115 , depending on atmospheric condition .",
    "@xmath20 lyr ( a0v ) , 59 her ( a3iv ) , @xmath21 psc ( f7v ) , hd 27962 ( a2iv ) , and @xmath22 her were observed during each run as radial velocity and/or rotational velocity templates .",
    "the average @xmath19 at continuum in the spectral region of interest was 150200 for the standard stars .",
    "double - lined spectroscopic binaries reveal two peaks , displacing back and forth , in the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) between variable and the radial velocity template spectrum as seen in fig .  1 .",
    "the location of the peaks allows to measure of the radial velocity of each component at the time of observation .",
    "the cross - correlation technique applied to digitized spectra is now one of the standard tools for the measurement of radial velocities in close binary systems .",
    "the radial velocities of v821cas were obtained by cross  correlating of chelle orders of v821cas spectra with the spectra of the bright radial velocity standard stars @xmath20 lyr ( a0v ) , 59 her ( a3iv ) and @xmath21 psc ( f7v ) ( nordstrm et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "for this purpose the iraf task was used .",
    "1 shows examples of ccfs of v821cas near the first and second quadrature .",
    "the two non - blended peaks correspond to each component of v821cas .",
    "we applied the cross - correlation technique to five wavelength regions with well - defined absorption lines of the primary and secondary components .",
    "these regions include the following lines : siiii 4568  , mgii 4481  , hei 5016  , hei 4917  , hei 5876  .",
    "the stronger ccf peak corresponds to the more massive component that also has a larger contribution to the observed spectrum . to better evaluate the centroids of the peaks ( i.e. the radial velocity difference between the target and the template ) , we adopted two separate gaussian fits for the case of significant peak separation .",
    "the radial velocity measurements , listed in table 2 together with their standard errors , are weighted means of the individual values deduced from each order ( see , e.g. , frasca et al . 2006 ) .",

    "( 2007 ) .    the first detailed solution of both radial velocity curves of v821cas components is presented in this study .",
    "we found the semi - amplitude of the more massive , more luminous component to be k@xmath0=120@xmath12 km s@xmath8 and k@xmath3=150@xmath12 km s@xmath8 for the secondary component .",
    "we have used our spectra to classify the primary component of v821cas . for this purpose",
    "we have degraded the spectral resolution from 20000 to 3000 , by convolving them with a gaussian kernel of the appropriate width , and we have measured the equivalent width ( @xmath23 ) of photospheric absorption lines useful for the spectral classification . we have followed the procedures of hernndez et al .",

    ". the standard deviations of the parameters have been determined by jktabsdimjkt / codes.html ] code , which calculates distance and other physical parameters using several different sources for bolometric corrections ( southworth et al .",
    "the radii of the components were estimated with uncertainties of 1.2 % and 1.6%",
    ". however , the uncertainties on the masses , being 3.3 % and 3.6 % , are slightly larger than the criteria of andersen ( 1991 ) for the necessary precision of absolute dimensions of stars to be used for comparison with theoretical models .",
    "an inspection of the temperatures , masses and radii of the component stars reveals a binary system composed of two main - sequence stars . the temperature @xmath29 k , mass @xmath30 m@xmath2 and radius @xmath31 r@xmath2 of the primary are consistent with the spectral type of a1v , and the temperature @xmath32 k , mass @xmath33 m@xmath2 and radius @xmath34 r@xmath2 of the secondary are consistent with an a4v spectral type star .",

    "using the observed visual magnitude and color indexes given by oja ( 1985 ) as v=8.26 , u - b=0.07 and b - v=0.11 mag we compute the reddening - free parameter as @xmath43 . using the tables given by hovhannessian ( 2004 ) we find the intrinsic colour index of @xmath44 mag and then the colour excess of @xmath45 mag for the system .",
    "the colours of the system were the average of three measurements .",
    "we should mention that there is no clue about the date of observations obtained , i.e. orbital phase .",
    "this value is in agreement with the e(b - v)=0.147 determined from the spectra given in  3.2 .    using the two @xmath35 values derived from photometric and spectroscopic data we calculated the de  reddening distance modulus of the system . to estimate the bolometric magnitudes of the components we adopted m@xmath46=4.74 mag for the sun . using the bolometric corrections given by drilling & landolt ( 2000 ) and girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we estimate the distance to the system as 260 and 274 pc , respectively , with an uncertainty of 12 pc . however , the average distance to the system is estimated to be 206@xmath47 pc from the trigonometric parallax measured by the hipparcos mission .",
    "our detection of the apsidal motion rate of the v821cas in  4 provides the opportunity to test the models of stellar internal structure .",
    "in addition to the classical newtonian contribution , the observed rate of rotation of apsides includes also the contributions arising from general relativity .",
    "the theory of general relativity estimates the relativistic contribution to observed rate as the following einstein formula :    @xmath48    where m@xmath49(@xmath50 ) denotes the individual masses of the components in solar mass , @xmath51 is the orbital eccentricity ( from radial velocity analysis ) and @xmath52 is the anomalistic period of the system in days .",
    "use of equation ( 4 ) for v821cas yields the relativistic contribution of 0@xmath7.0009 cycle@xmath8 which is only 6 per cent of the observed rate . removing the relativistic contribution from the observed rate of apsidal motion",
    ", one can calculate the observational average value of internal structure constant ( @xmath53 ) using the following formula :    @xmath54    where c@xmath55(@xmath50 ) are the functions of the orbital eccentricity , fractional radii and masses of the components and ratio of the rotational velocities of the component stars to the keplerian velocity .",
    "the observed average value of @xmath56 is found to be -2.56@xmath10.07 from eq .",

    "interpolation for the masses and @xmath58 of the component star v821cas yielded -2.48 and -2.37 for the primary and secondary components , respectively .",
    "the mean theoretical value of internal structure constant was computed as @xmath59=-2.43 which is in agreement with that of observed within 2@xmath60 level .",
    "the internal structure constant obtained from the o - c analysis is smaller by 35 % than predicted from the theory .",
    "the present analysis shows that the component stars are more concentrated in mass than predicted by theoretical calculations .          in fig .",

    "the effective temperature of the primary component appears to be slightly higher than the model for 2 m@xmath2 .",
    "however , when the uncertainties of the effective temperatures of the components are taken into account it is seen that the deviations from the models are less than 1@xmath60 level .",
    "the diagram suggests that both components of v821cas are main sequence stars , relatively young with an age of about 560 myr .",
    "to study the kinematical properties of v821cas , we used the system s center - of - mass velocity , distance and proper motion values , which are given in table 6 .",
    "the proper motion data were taken from newly reduced hipparcos catalogue ( van leeuwen 2007 ) , whereas the center - of - mass velocity and distance are obtained in this study .",

    "the u , v and w space velocity components and their errors were obtained and given in table 6 . to obtain the space velocity precisely the first - order galactic differential rotation correction",
    "was taken into account ( mihalas & binney 1981 ) , and -1.08 and 0.65 kms@xmath8 differential corrections were applied to u and v space velocity components , respectively .",

    "this value is in agreement with other young stars space velocities .    to determine the population type of v821cas the galactic orbit of the system",
    "was examined .",
    "using dinescu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) n - body code , the system s apogalactic ( @xmath65 ) and perigalactic ( @xmath66 ) distances were obtained as 9.09 and 8.07 kpc , respectively .",

    "when determining the ellipticity the following formula was used :    @xmath68    the ellipticity was calculated as @xmath69 .",
