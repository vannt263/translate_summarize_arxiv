    "the effect of impurity scattering can also be seen from the calculated @xmath123 and @xmath124 as functions of @xmath125 at @xmath95k and @xmath108kv / cm in fig.[f3](c ) , where the electron heating with @xmath119s@xmath120 through nonlinear phonon scattering is completely masked by the strong impurity scattering at @xmath121s@xmath120 , leading to relative cooling of conduction electrons in a nanoribbon in the linear regime .    at relatively low temperatures @xmath126k and low concentration of electrons ( @xmath127@xmath114 ) in the lowest conduction band , as well as medium impurity concentration @xmath128@xmath129 ,",

    "fixing @xmath139  and making @xmath101 , we do see from fig.[f4](a ) that @xmath93 is dramatically increased when @xmath136 is changed from @xmath140  ( @xmath141s@xmath120 ) to @xmath142  ( @xmath143s@xmath120 ) due to enlarged group velocity of electrons and reduced line - edge roughness scattering .",
    "in addition , the magnitude in the enhancement of @xmath93 with @xmath94 is large in the sample with @xmath131  because the weakened elastic scattering , and therefore , the relatively strong initial heating of electrons by phonon scattering to high energy states with a larger group velocity .",

    "therefore , we find from fig.[f5](a ) that @xmath93 is increased as @xmath101 when @xmath100 is reduced to @xmath142  in the low field regime .",
    "however , the value of @xmath97 for @xmath93 is pushed upward for @xmath150  in the high - field regime , which is further accompanied by a reduced magnitude in the enhancement of @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "this anomalous feature associated with reducing @xmath100 also has a profound impact on the @xmath19-dependence of @xmath93 as shown in fig.[f5](b ) , where the increasing rate of @xmath93 with @xmath19 in the high field regime becomes much lower with @xmath150  than for @xmath151 .",
    "in addition , the calculated @xmath110 in fig.[f5](c ) displays an anomalous cooling behavior ( with a smaller spreading of @xmath111 in the @xmath112 space ) in the high field regime for conduction electrons as @xmath100 is reduced to @xmath142 , similar to the results shown in fig.[f3](c ) .",
    "we have performed similar calculations with metallic ribbons of comparable width @xmath152  and found no perceptible difference in the nonlinear electron transport and heating provided that the rest of the parameters ( electron and impurities concentrations and decay rates ) are kept the same .",
    "in conclusion , we have found there is a minimum electron mobility just before a threshold for an applied electric field when entering into the nonlinear transport regime , which is attributed to the gradual build - up of a frictional force from phonon scattering by the applied field .",
    "we also predict a field - induced mobility enhancement right after this threshold value , which is regarded as a consequence of initially - heated electrons in high energy states with a larger group velocity in an elastic - scattering dominated graphene nanoribbon .",
    "moreover , we have discovered that this mobility enhancement reaches a maximum in the nonlinear transport regime as a combined result of an upper limit for the group velocity in a nanoribbon and a field - induced dramatically - increased phonon scattering in the system .",
    "finally , the threshold field can be pushed upward and the magnitude in the mobility enhancement can be reduced simultaneously by a small correlation length for the line - edge roughness in the high - field limit due to the occupation of high - energy states by field - induced electron heating .    when the electron density is increased in a graphene nanoribbon ,",
    "multi - subband transport occurs , the field - induced mobility enhancement is expected to be reduced , and the effect of electron - electron scattering needs to be included . when the lattice temperature becomes high , on the other hand ,",
    "both the optical phonon and inter - valley scattering should be considered . as the width of a nanoribbon",
    "is modulated , a periodic potential along the ribbon will form , leading to a graphene nanoribbon superlattice with additional miniband gap opening at the brillouin zone boundaries .",
