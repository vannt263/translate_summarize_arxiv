    "granular materials include sand , sugar , crushed coal , cereals , pills , cosmetics , and asteroids .",
    "the transport , mixing , and segregation of granular materials is important in the pharmaceutical , mining , agricultural , metal , food , and energy industries . even in the chemical industry , the majority of the products are in granular rather than liquid form  @xcite .",
    "thus a large engineering literature has developed on `` powders and particulates '' .",
    "however , a basic understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying the collective behavior of particles in a granular medium is lacking .",
    "granular media can exhibit both solid and fluid properties ( e.g. , one can walk on a beach or pour the sand from a bucket ) , but granular media are less well understood than solids and fluids . while fluids are processed in industry with high efficiency , the efficiency of handling ( crushing , mixing , separation ) of granular materials is estimated to be well below optimum  @xcite .",
    "the scientific study of granular systems has a long history , including a discussion by galileo in his _ dialogues _ and an 1831 study by faraday of convective motion of grains in heaps in vertically oscillated granular layers  @xcite . in recent years",
    "there has been a resurgence of interest in granular media among physicists , thanks to pierre - giles de gennes , who recommended in the early 1980s to young french scientists that granular matter was an interesting subject worthy of study  @xcite . in the past two decades",
    "there has been an explosion of interest in granular systems .",
    "a search in inspec on the word `` granular '' followed by `` system , medium , matter , flow , or gas '' yields 20 papers in the three year period 1980 - 82 , while a decade later the number of papers in a three year period jumped to 112 , and in 2000 - 2002 there were 691 papers on the subject .",
    "the growth is not so dramatic for literature searches using terms often used in industry ( powder , particles , particulates ) , but most of that work is empirical , and much of that literature concerns pastes , soil , and fine particles ( powders ) .",
    "we make no attempt to review the enormous literature on granular / particulate matter but list a few reviews  @xcite , books  @xcite , and several journals : _ powder technology _ , _ granular matter _ , _ particle science and technology _ , and _",
    "advanced powder technology_.    the key property distinguishing collisions of granular particles from collisions of atoms in an ordinary gas is dissipation : collisions between macroscopic grains are inelastic  in the absence of external forcing , the particles in a granular medium all come to rest .",
    "a measure of this dissipation is the coefficient of restitution @xmath0 , which is the ratio of the relative normal velocity of two particles after a collision to the relative normal velocity before collision .",
    "some representative values of @xmath0 for a relative normal velocity of 0.1 m / s are 0.96 for hardened bronze , 0.85 for aluminum , and 0.3 for lead  @xcite ; the values depend on the particle bulk and surface properties in a complicated way ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite )",
    ".    this chapter concerns rapid granular flows , which is called the collisional regime to distinguish it from the quasi - static regime where particles are at rest or nearly so .",
    "much of the granular literature concerns the quasi - static regime where inertia is not significant and chains of particles in contact bear most of the load .",
    "understanding the development and evolution of these force chains and the role of steric hindrance is often the focus of the research on sand piles and other granular systems at rest or nearly at rest .",
    "the collisional and quasi - static regimes are each difficult , but the intermediate regime with some particles moving rapidly while others are at rest is even more difficult . for an example , see the contribution in this book on the formation of craters in a granular medium  @xcite",
    ".    we will consider situations where only contact forces are important .",
    "for small particles ( less than@xmath150 @xmath2 m ) , electrostatic and van der waals forces become important .",
    "further , air friction can be significant , but for particles greater than about 1 mm in diameter , air friction is often negligible if the velocity is not too large .",
    "an oft - studied example of a granular medium in the collisional regime is a collection of particles in a vertically oscillating container .",
    "section 2 describes spatial patterns formed by such a system .",
    "since the number of particles in an experiment can be small ( less than one million ) , newton s laws for the motion of these particles can be directly implemented on a personal computer .",
    "section 3 discusses such molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations for hard , spherical particles that are characterized by a restitution coefficient and a frictional coefficient .",
    "most theoretical analyses of granular flows examine frictionless ( smooth ) inelastic spheres , but there exist no frictionless macroscopic particles , just as there are no elastic particles .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations show that realistic models of rapid granular motions must include friction ",
    "friction provides another mode of dissipation and also results in reduced grain mobility and a higher particle collision rate  @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations including friction describe experimental observations on oscillating granular media very well , as we shall describe in section 3 , but simulations without friction fail to capture even qualitatively some important aspects of the observations .",
    "studies of oscillated granular layers have revealed localized structures ,  oscillons \" , which are stable for a range of container oscillation frequencies and amplitudes .",
    "section 4 describes the properties of oscillons and shows how they can be considered as the basic building blocks of some extended spatial patterns .",
    "the continuum approach to granular flows is introduced in section 5 , where equations of motion derived by jenkins and richman for a dilute dissipative fluid are presented .",
    "the jenkins - richman equations are similar to the navier - stokes equations for a fluid but are modified to include dissipative effects arising from collisions between the grains .",
    "however , the equations do not include the effect of friction in grain - grain collisions or grain - container collisions .",
    "as will be discussed , the application of continuum equations to granular flows must be considered with caution because , unlike an ordinary fluid , in granular flows there is not a large separation between the microscopic and macroscopic length and time scales .    in a granular",
    "fluid the speed of propagation of pressure fluctuations ( the sound speed ) is only a few centimeters / sec , which is very small compared to the 330 m / s sound speed in air .",
    "( the granular sound speed here refers to particles in vacuum ; there is no air and the only particles are the dissipative grains . ) hence the average streaming speed of granular flows generally exceeds the sound speed in the flow , and shock waves form whenever the flow encounters an obstacle .",
    "these shock waves are the subject of section 6 , where observations from experiments are compared with molecular dynamics and continuum simulations",
    ".    we will conclude with a discussion in section 7 that mentions some of the many issues open in the understanding of systems of dissipative particles .",

    "we consider patterns that arise spontaneously , not from sidewall forcing or from interstitial gas , but from correlations induced by multiple collisions between the grains and between the grains and the container bottom .",

    "a heuristic argument for the critical value of @xmath12 for the onset of instability of a flat oscillating layer was given in  @xcite .",
    "the authors argued that a flat layer becomes unstable when the collision occurs at the plate s lowest point .",

    "<S> granular media such as sand and sugar are ubiquitous in nature and industry but are less well understood than fluids or solids . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the behavior of rapid granular flows where the transfer of momenta by collisions dominates . </S>",
    "<S> the physics is quite different for the opposite limit of static or slowly moving grains ( e.g. , sand piles ) . to gain understanding of granular flows </S>",
    "<S> we consider two problems that have been investigated with experiments , particle simulations and hydrodynamic theory : vertically oscillating granular layers and flow past an obstacle . </S>",
    "<S> oscillating granular layers spontaneously form spatial patterns when the container acceleration amplitude exceeds a critical value , about 2.5 times the gravitational acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> simulations with hard spheres that conserve linear momentum and dissipate energy in collisions are in qualitative accord with some but not all aspects of the observed patterns . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to include friction and angular momentum conservation in the simulations to achieve quantitative accord with observations .    </S>",
    "<S> the applicability of a hydrodynamic theory to granular flows is not obvious because for typical conditions the particle mean free path is comparable to the length scale over which velocity and density fields change ; hence there is not the separation of scales needed to justify a hydrodynamic approach . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that navier - stokes - like equations describe well the density and temperature fields in vertically oscillating layers , even though this system is far from isothermal , incompressible fluid dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the second problem examined , flow past an obstacle , is also described well by particle simulations for frictional dissipative particles , but continuum simulations are only in qualitative accord with the observations . we show that continuum theory fails because it does not include friction between particles . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how shock waves are common in granular flows since the the speed of sound ( pressure waves ) in a granular gas is typically only a few centimeters / second , while mean flow speeds are typically meters / second . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of shocks in granular experiments and simulations is made with shocks in ordinary gases . </S>",
    "<S> much more research is needed to understand how shocks evolve in granular flows . </S>"
