    "transition to turbulence may occur through gradual supercritical scenarios as in rayleigh - bnard convection or in taylor - couette flow when the outer cylinder is at rest .",
    "it is then well understood in terms of linear stability analysis . beyond these cases",
    ", the transition to turbulence may also happen in a more sudden fashion that linear stability analysis fails to predict .",
    "most wall - bounded shear flows fall into this last category and experience a subcritical transition to turbulence involving the abrupt appearance of a disorganised state within the laminar phase .",
    "plane couette ( pcf ) , hagen - poiseuille or plane poiseuille flows are typical examples of such a transition . the reynolds number defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are typical velocity and length scales and @xmath3 is the fluid kinematic viscosity , being the natural control parameter of these systems , several critical values of @xmath4 can be pointed out . following linear stability analysis",
    ", these flows should become turbulent beyond @xmath5 but experiments or numerical simulations show that turbulent patches can be sustained for values of @xmath4 exceeding some value @xmath6 with @xmath7 which is a global stability threshold below which any perturbation relaxes to the laminar state . in the pcf case",
    ", one can also define @xmath8 beyond which the flow is always observed to be homogeneously turbulent and below which turbulence only fills a fraction of space @xmath9 , hereafter called the turbulent fraction .",
    "it follows that a transitional range exists between @xmath6 and @xmath8 where laminar and turbulent domains coexist , where the flow is sensitive to finite size / amplitude perturbations and displays a strong hysteresis .",
    "+ in the nineties , two teams in saclay and stockholm have studied the transition to turbulence in pcf experimentally , pointing out its subcritical nature@xcite and characterising the growth of triggered turbulent patches thus denominated as spots@xcite .",
    "these turbulent spots consist of localised coherent structures made of small - scale longitudinal vortices and velocity streaks characteristic of wall turbulence and already evidenced and studied in boundary layer@xcite , channel flows@xcite and numerical plane couette flow in the pioneering work of lundbladh and johansson@xcite .",
    "an other striking feature of pcf in the transitional range is the existence of a steady pattern of alternating turbulent and laminar stripes inclined with respect to the mean flow .",
    "these patterns were first observed experimentally by coles and van atta in taylor - couette flow@xcite and by prigent _",
    "_ in pcf@xcite and since then reproduced numerically by different teams in pcf@xcite and channel flow@xcite .",
    "+ spot growth has been carefully studied by the different teams cited above with similar results : growth rates in the streamwise and spanwise directions have been found to be almost constant during the growth and to be increasing functions of the reynolds number ; waves at the spots edges have been observed to move at a speed slower than the spreading of turbulence . regarding the growth mechanism",
    ", it could be due to stochastic nucleation of new streaks at the edge of the spot associated with a local destabilisation of the velocity profile at the laminar - turbulent interface , or to non - normal growth .",
    "a seemingly key element already pointed out in the work of lundbladh and johansson@xcite is the large - scale flow that develops around the turbulent growing spots with a kind of quadrupolar structure that has been observed numerically in pcf@xcite and in model flows@xcite but which is also present along the regular laminar / turbulent patterns@xcite .",
    "so far , they have never been observed experimentally in pcf and only very recently in plane poiseuille@xcite in spite of the important role they may play regarding spot growth and pattern sustainment as recently suggested by duguet and schlatter@xcite who proposed a mechanism combining stochastic nucleation of new streaks at the spot edges and their advection by large scale flows to explain the spot growth and its tendency to form oblique patterns simultaneously .",
    "+ in the present article , we aim at evidencing large - scale flows at the laminar - turbulent interfaces in an experimental plane couette flow and at quantifying them as much as possible all along the growth process .",
    "this would be a first step in the precise understanding of turbulence spreading in the transitional range of pcf .",
    "the article is organised as follows : we first describe our experimental set - up , the acquisition chain and the post - processing methods in [ sec : meth ] . in section [ sec",
    ": res ] , dedicated to quantitative measurements of large - scale flows in two very different laminar - turbulent coexistence situations , we particularly insist on the dynamical aspects .",

    "this dependence on the turbulent fraction can be understood in the framework of flow rate conservation argument evoked above : the larger the turbulent fraction , the longer the overhang and thus the larger the flow rate imbalance that has to be compensated by stronger large scale flows .",
    "+ according to our understanding and experimental observations , large - scale flows exist all along the growth process till turbulence has spread over the whole spanwise direction . then",
    "two scenarios are possible : if @xmath126 , large - scale flow exist but spots survive rather than grow . if spots ultimately grow ( _ i.e. _ if @xmath127 ) large - scale flows show rapid increase and eventually stabilise on finite value associated to a steady turbulent fraction .",

    "the steady ultimate turbulent fraction is too small to accommodate such patterns and the triggered spot starts reorganising as inclined patterns before reaching the spanwise edges .",
    "the final state is a wandering mix of inclined fractioned stripes whose turbulent fraction highly fluctuates around a stationary value .",
    "this critical  @xmath124 is consistent with prigent s work who reported that organised steady patterns can be observed only above @xmath128 while below stripes are not stable and one mostly observes stretched spots@xcite . some preliminary numerical simulations similar to the present study confirm most of these observations and points out the resurgence of the large scales when the turbulent spot later reorganises to form laminar / turbulent stripes as those observed in large domains @xcite.an other intriguing and interesting feature is the role played by large - scale recirculations in the spreading of turbulence . on the one hand",
    ", we have shown that these recirculations are present as soon as laminar and turbulent domain coexist , growth being observed or not , but on the other hand , schumacher and eckhardt @xcite attest that no growth is observed when what they call the outflow is suppressed around a localised turbulent spot in a shear flow very similar to plane couette . in a streamwisely constrained plane couette geometry where no large scale flow is present , duguet _ et al . _",
