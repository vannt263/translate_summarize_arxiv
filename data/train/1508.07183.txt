    "over recent years the covariant dyson - schwinger - bethe - salpeter - equation ( dsbse ) approach to qcd @xcite has matured via numerous individual studies of meson and baryon states and related phenomena . to trace and sketch the relevant literature , one may consult works on : pseudoscalar , vector @xcite , and other mesons @xcite , baryon masses @xcite leptonic , electromagnetic , and hadronic interactions of both mesons @xcite and baryons @xcite , as well as further states @xcite    many technical and numerical refinements and developments @xcite have made it possible and desirable to attempt an as - comprehensive - as - possible application of these techniques to hadron phenomenology . for the sake of feasibility , first steps were taken in a rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncated setup of the dsbse framework using a suitable effective interaction model .",
    "anchoring for an effective rl investigation needs to be provided in the heavy - quark domain , first approached in this context in @xcite for bottomonium ground states and extended in our recent studies of heavy quarkonia @xcite , and exotic @xmath5 states @xcite . at the same time",
    ", additional model - independent anchoring happens in and towards the chiral limit via the satisfaction of the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity @xcite .",
    "for the case of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , this guarantees a massless pion ground state and vanishing leptonic decay constants for all radial pion excitations in the chiral limit as well as the validity of a generalized gell - mann - oakes - renner relation for any pseudoscalar meson and quark mass @xcite .",
    "satisfaction of the the axial - vector and other ward - takahashi identities is one of the strengths of the rl truncated setup in the dsbse approach . on the other hand ,",
    "these identities can be used to find appropriate constructions of the quark - gluon vertex ( qgv ) and corresponding truncations of the dsbse system . in any truncation ,",
    "the use of an effective quark - gluon interaction remains , but this interaction will necessarily be different at different levels of truncation .    the qgv @xcite can easily be made more complicated in simple interaction models @xcite .",
    "also , beyond - rl calculations with more sophisticated kinds of an effective interaction are available @xcite , albeit too tedious for large - scale computations .",
    "in addition , one needs to build understanding in more basic truncations first before advancing to more complicated ones ; e.g. , technical details and problems are much more easily worked out this way .",
    "furthermore still , the importance of resonant corrections can not be stressed enough .",
    "we remark at this point that our calculations provide bound - state solutions from the bse ; hadronic ( and other ) decay widths can be obtained in a semi - perturbative fashion via consistent constructions corresponding to the decay mechanism @xcite .    for the present purpose of a comprehensive investigation",
    ", we continue along the lines of our fitting strategy first described in @xcite , where we employed it to find an optimal rl - based description of heavy quarkonia . in the application to light mesons it turned out that an overall satisfactory description of light isovector meson spectra seems not possible with our particular model setup and parametrization of our effective one - dressed - gluon interaction .    in turn , for the study of exotic mesons in @xcite we investigated several sets of splittings among light - meson masses and",
    "were able to find some with a reasonable correlation to exotic spectra in order to warrant using them to obtain predictions for exotic heavy quarkonia .",

    "a prime example is the original work of maris and tandy @xcite where a reasonable fit of @xmath32 and @xmath2 properties was obtained for three @xmath33 pairs , which are  omitting units for simplicity ",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 . when simplified to a one - parameter model via the prescription @xmath37 ( the standard - maris - tandy value of",

    "this is not surprising , since its value in the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) defines a scale at which the long - range part of the effective interaction is strongest  a characteristic expected to be relevant in excitations rather than ground states .",
    "strategies to arrive at results independent of the model - parameter values for excited states can then rely on ratios of calculated masses for selected pairs with a strongly correlated @xmath24 dependence in order to predict isolated quantities , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . for a more comprehensive approach , however , it is important to have a systematic broad basis of parameter sets to investigate .",
    "we work on a grid of @xmath41 gev @xmath42 @xmath43 gev@xmath44 .",
    "figure [ fig : couplings ] illustrates the form of the effective coupling defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) for all combinations of @xmath24 and @xmath4 used herein .",
    "the axes are : @xmath4 , used to group curves with the same @xmath4 value , but different @xmath24 values ( this is shown in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : couplings ] ) ; and @xmath45 to show the @xmath46 dependence of @xmath22 , but at the same time highlight the peak of the curve and label it by the corresponding value of @xmath24 ( this can be seen best in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : couplings ] ) .",
    "obviously , the peak height of each curve rises with increasing @xmath4 for constant @xmath24 .",
    "also , for equal @xmath4 , the lowest @xmath47 gev produces the largest peak , while the largest of our @xmath48 gev yields the lowest peak .    our quark - mass value of @xmath49 gev ( given at a renormalization point @xmath50 gev )",
    "is fixed such that the experimental value for the pion mass is reproduced , which is universally the case for this current - quark mass value on our @xmath24-@xmath4 grid , and we consider the case of isovector mesons in the isospin - symmetric limit .",
    "note at this point that nothing prohibits us from studying isoscalars as well , but this case is a lot more complicated due to flavor mixing with the @xmath51 case .",
    "while we could do this and extend our study along these lines , the main difficulty would be a consistent setup of flavor - mixing , which happens on the meson level on the basis of the computed @xmath52 and @xmath51 states , since rl truncation does not contain flavor mixing in the bse kernel .    in our strategy",
    "the general idea is to plot @xmath53 from the comparison of the experimental splitting under consideration to our calculated values across the @xmath24-@xmath4 grid and analyze and identify trends and regions of better or worse agreement with experiment . in a successful global fitting attempt",
    ", we would then find overlapping regions of good agreement with experimental splittings for all relevant cases , such that an overall satisfactory description of the isovector meson masses results .",
    "each figure of this kind herein is plotted from the same viewing angle onto the @xmath24-@xmath4 grid , unless the resulting @xmath53 surface can not be seen properly or one of its essential features is hidden . for the cases where our calculations did nt produce a numerically convincing result",
    ", `` empty grid points '' may appear in the plot .",
    "this is the result of some of the numerical techniques used in order to arrive at our computed results ; details on numerical setup and difficulties as well as solution strategies can be found in @xcite .",
    "error bars corresponding to our numerical uncertainties for our results are generated by our calculations automatically .",
    "however , for the sake of clarity they are not given in the fitting plots but only where results for a particular set of computed results are plotted versus the data , such as figs .",
    "[ fig : isov - spectrum ] or [ fig : isov - spectrum - fit ] . note also that regions of equally low @xmath53 in the plots does not indicate a correlation of the model parameters @xmath24 and @xmath4 , since there is no universal pattern across the various plots herein .",
    "we treat these two parameters as completely uncorrelated .    a prominent example for a meson - mass splitting is the hyperfine splitting between the @xmath54 and @xmath55 ground states .",
    "our comparison is shown in the upper left corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : splittingsexotic ] . to properly and clearly identify splittings",
    "we introduce the following notation : a splitting is denoted by the quantum numbers @xmath56 together with a subscript @xmath57 for the radial excitation with @xmath58 denoting the ground state , @xmath59 the first radial excitation , etc .",
    "for the example of the hyperfine splitting , we thus write @xmath60 $ ] . for a set of splittings",
    "fitted simultaneously we denote them together in parentheses .",
    "it appears that in order to provide a good fit for the hyperfine splitting in the isovector case one would need to investigate values towards the `` traditional '' values for @xmath24 and @xmath4 from the original work of maris and tandy .",
    "the general trend is that the splitting is better reproduced for lower values of both @xmath24 and @xmath4 . to immediately expand this picture",
    "we also show the hyperfine splitting of the first radial excitations in the pseudoscalar and vector channels in the center of the first row in fig .",
    "[ fig : splittingsexotic ] .",
    "there the situation is similar : lower values of @xmath24 lead to a better description of the splitting , but in this case rather independent of the value of @xmath4 .",
    "returning to the aforementioned interpretation of @xmath24 as an inverse effective range of the interaction , one would conclude from the hyperfine splittings alone that a larger effective range is favored in the interaction .",
    "however , while the hyperfine splitting is iconic , there are many others to consider and the picture is complicated by splittings such as those regarding radial and orbital excitations , which are discussed in detail in the appendix . here , we revisit and deepen the investigation published in ref .  @xcite .      in short , the problem investigated in @xcite",
    "was how to reach a good fit of the @xmath61 spectrum without actually fitting it . to illustrate our region of interest we turn directly to the @xmath61 states and plot a comparison for the radial splitting between the ground and first excited @xmath1 states , @xmath62 $ ] , in the right upper corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : splittingsexotic ] on the one hand . on the other hand , we add two more splittings to form a set of three , namely the splitting of each @xmath1 state to the ground - state pseudoscalar meson together with the radial exotic splitting , @xmath63,[1^{-+}_1 - 0^{-+}_0],[1^{-+}_0 - 0^{-+}_0])$ ] and show the result at the left of the center row in fig .  [",
    "fig : splittingsexotic ] .",
    "while the plot showing merely the exotic vector radial splitting remains inconclusive regarding the interesting parameter domain , the combination clearly shows a region of low @xmath53 in the interior of our grid , which is the necessary prerequisite .",
    "the next step was to identify a set of non - exotic splittings that provide similar results for our fitting - attempts , i.e. , a reasonable correlation to the exotic case .",
    "it turned out that axial - vector mesons are good indicators .",
    "in particular , we studied several sets of splittings .",
    "to start , the simple splitting between the @xmath64 and @xmath65 ground states @xmath66 $ ] is shown in the center of fig .",
    "[ fig : splittingsexotic ] .",
    "while there is a visible trend , this does nt show a clear preference in any small enough region of our grid .",
    "while at least the combination high @xmath24 and low @xmath4 are excluded , more information is needed to proceed . as a consequence , we added two more splittings analogous to the case above , namely those of each axial - vector ground state to the pseudoscalar ground state .",
    "the result is shown at the right of the center row in fig .",
    "[ fig : splittingsexotic ] for the combination @xmath67,[1^{++}_0 - 0^{-+}_0],[1^{+-}_0 - 0^{-+}_0])$ ] , which allows to focus on a well - defined region inside our grid as well .",
    "even better , this plot is nicely correlated with the exotic - pseudoscalar splitting set and so our marker set of splittings was found .    on a little detour to the isoscalar case , more precisely strangeonium",
    ", one can see that additional difficulty is added with the loss of a reliable match for the pseudoscalar ground state due to @xmath68 flavor mixing , which is not represented in an rl bse kernel .",
    "thus , an alternative to @xmath67 $ ] , @xmath69,[1^{+-}_0 - 0^{-+}_0])$ ] must be found to predict @xmath1 states in the strangeonium system , i.e. , assuming ideal flavor mixing , along the same lines as for the heavy quarkonia . without too much trouble , one can try two approaches : first , use the pseudoscalar ground state nonetheless by employing some dummy experimental mass for a pure light - light pseudoscalar in the comparison .",
    "secondly , one could replace the pseudoscalar ground state by the vector ground state , which is a good choice in strangeonium due to the confirmed ideal mixing of the @xmath70 and @xmath24 mesons .",
    "following the second example , we plot @xmath53 for the isovector case and the set @xmath67,[1^{++}_0 - 1^{--}_0],[1^{+-}_0 - 1^{--}_0])$ ] in the left lower corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : splittingsexotic ] and also at the center of the lower row in fig .",
    "[ fig : splittingsexotic ] from a different angle .",
    "apparently this works well by preferring also the large-@xmath24-large-@xmath4 region of our grid , except that there is no clear `` wall '' or `` boundary '' signaling a best value _ inside _ our grid .",
    "the same fit on the @xmath51 dataset yields a plot shown in the lower right corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : splittingsexotic ] .",
    "it is evident , that in this case the `` missing of a boundary '' is even more pronounced , i.e. , our grid is too small to make a definitive statement about whether or not one can find a minimum for @xmath53 in this case .",
    "however , one should not forget that with the light and strange quark masses being rather close together , so should be the parameter sets optimal for the description of the data .",
    "this comes from the fact that , while we do allow our model parameters to be different for each quark mass as a result of our philosophy that in our phenomenological rl approach effects beyond rl truncation could be absorbed by the effective interaction and its parameters including their values , the actual variation should be moderate and thus small from the light to the strange - quark case .",
    "we illustrate the two cases discussed above by plotting the corresponding spectra for the pair @xmath71 gev and @xmath72 gev@xmath44 for the isovector and @xmath48 gev and @xmath72 gev@xmath44 for the strangeonium cases in the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : isov - spectrum ] , respectively .",
    "in addition to what has been already provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , we thus predict the two lowest - lying @xmath0 states in the @xmath1 channel at @xmath73 and @xmath74 gev , respectively .                                          before proceeding , a short discussion of the basic philosophy regarding our comparison to experimental data is in order : to make things simple and straight - forward , we assume the point of view that each light isovector meson state as given by the pdg @xcite corresponds to a bound state in our calculations . while this is straight - forward indeed , it may be oversimplified , since there is the possibility that @xmath6 states such as used herein are only the basis for the actual content of mesonic states seen in experiment .",
    "this is also one reason for us not to continue our study to , e.g. , the isoscalar case , since there many possible admixtures such as glueballs or molecules would have to be taken into account .",
    "we also neglect effects of hadronic or other decay mechanisms at this point , since inclusion of any of the effects mentioned here would be beyond the scope of the present study .    in summary",
    ", our results must be taken with a grain of salt and seen as some sort of @xmath6-core states in a simple matching attempt to the experimental light - meson data set .",
    "at the same time , we stress that more informed and detailed comparisons based on matching principles which take into account both non resonant as well as resonant corrections are immediate next steps in a comprehensive study such as the one presented here .",
    "in particular , the covariant and well - constrained dsbse formalism provides an ideal candidate for providing reliable @xmath6 core states in such an improved future study .    it is also important to note at this point that not all radial excitations used here are well - established experimentally like , e.g. , the @xmath75 in the @xmath64 channel or those for higher meson spin @xmath76 .",
    "nonetheless , we plot our basic overview using the values provided by the pdg @xcite .    in this section",
    "we illustrate all splittings in our study of a particular meson state to the pion ground state .",
    "this is particularly interesting , since the pion ground state is fixed to its experimental value and , in addition , its position in our computational framework is extremely robust via the inherent satisfaction of the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity .",
    "thus , one has to pay special attention to this set of splittings in a fitting attempt , since varying or readjusting the current - quark mass in our framework has a drastically different effect on pion - related mass splittings on one hand and the rest on the other hand .",
    "in short , as immediately illustrated by the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation , the pion mass rises like the square root of the current - quark mass close to the chiral limit , while other meson masses rise linearly plus some small corrections .",
    "the set presented here is comprehensive . among these splittings",
    ", there are more prominent or dominant ones to observe .",
    "first , we mention the hyperfine splitting , which we already used at the beginning of our discussion for a first impression and example of the method and resulting statements .",
    "next , the scalar- and axialvector - to - pion splittings are relevant due to the lower - lying masses of these states , after which we complete the picture with the @xmath77 states .    precisely , the list of splittings shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pionsplittings ] is : @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath78 $ ] , @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath69 $ ] , @xmath80 $ ] , @xmath81 $ ] , @xmath82 $ ] , @xmath83 $ ] , @xmath84 $ ] . at first sight , the appearance of the plots for the various splittings in this figure is rather diverse ; one observes trends in virtually all possible directions .",
    "the hyperfine splitting , e.g. , shows a clear preference for low @xmath24 together with low @xmath4 even beyond our grid .",
    "the scalar - pseudoscalar splitting prefers high @xmath4 and a low @xmath24 inside our domain ; both axial - vector- , the exotic - vector- , and the pseudotensor - pseudoscalar splittings have their favored regions toward the center of our grid .",
    "the remaining tensor - related splittings for the @xmath85 and @xmath86 tend in opposite directions from each other .    despite these different tendencies , the combined fit of all these splittings ,",
    "whose favored pair of @xmath24-@xmath4 values should also already provide a reasonable match to the experimental spectrum , shows a favored `` valley '' from @xmath87 gev combined with our highest @xmath4 to @xmath88 gev combined with a central value for @xmath4 .",
    "this result is presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fitpion ] .",

    "finally , we reduce the fit to the three splittings @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath69 $ ] and the corresponding result is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fitpion ] .",
    "this refinement does not do much qualitatively except that it favors a value of @xmath87 gev more clearly with our two steps of reducing the numbers of splittings involved in the fit .           to provide an comprehensive effort and picture",
    ", we present a combination of all splittings presented herein , both above as well as in the appendix below , in the three groups we used throughout each discussion , in fig .",

[",
    "fig : isov - spectrum - fit ] .",
    "apparently , the inclusion of too many ( all ) splittings in the fit did not properly capture the essence of the mass spectrum .",
    "one of the main reasons is certainly the importance and somewhat exceptional role of the pion ground state and all associated splittings .",
    "this peculiarity of the light - meson spectrum , however , is an essential feature and can not be ignored or underrepresented like in this attempt , if it is to be successful .    as a comparison the center and right panels of fig .",

    "thus and due to the straight - forward and simple matching strategy employed here , we postpone such a step to future investigations .",
    "in fact , an improved description of the data will probably rather be accomplished by exploring more parameters / degrees of freedom in the rl effective interaction or introducing corrections beyond rl truncation , both of which are beyond the scope of the present study .",
