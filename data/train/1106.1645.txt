    "galactic black hole binaries ( gbhs ) are strong sources of x - ray radiation .",
    "this radiation can be decomposed into two main components : soft thermal radiation originating in an accretion disc , and hard power - law like emission , probably originating in the process of comptonisation of the disc photons by hot electrons located in the so - called corona ( see reviews by remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; done , gierliski & kubota 2007 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the disk and corona contribute at different levels to the total spectrum .",
    "consequently , a number of different gbh spectral shapes have been observed and classified into two main spectral states . in the soft state",
    "the hot disc dominates the spectrum up to a few kev and is accompanied by a weak power - law tail with a soft photon index , @xmath2 . in the hard state",
    "the disc is much cooler and the total x - ray band is dominated by the radiation of the corona with typically a hard photon index , @xmath3 .",
    "the physical origin of the transitions between the spectral states is not clear yet .",
    "nevertheless , phenomenologically the evolution of the x - ray spectral shape within a given state and during the transition from one state to another is relatively well understood .",
    "the gbhs in outburst track the same , continuous q - shaped pattern in the so - called hardness - intensity diagram ( hid , e.g. fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ; dunn et al .",
    "2008 ) . from this diagram",
    "it follows that initially the x - ray spectra of gbhs are dominated by the hard colour and their intensity is low ; the sources are in a hard state and reside in the bottom / right corner of the hid . with time , the intensity increases but the spectra remain dominated by the hard colour ; the sources move upwards in the diagram . at some point ,",
    "further increase in intensity results in the decrease of hardness , and the sources move toward the top / left part of the hid .",
    "eventually , a transition to a soft state takes place , resulting in populating the top / left section of the hid . towards the decay of the outburst",
    "the intensity decreases and a transition back to a hard state is observed .",
    "the soft - to - hard state transition occurs typically at lower intensity than the hard - to - soft state transition at the beginning of the outburst ( e.g. gierliski & newton 2006 ) , which leads to a hysteresis pattern in the hid .",
    "theoretical explanation of the hysteresis include effects of different source of coronal irradiation in the hard and soft states ( meyer - hofmeister , liu & meyer 2005 , 2009 ) , and in the most extreme cases a non - steady state behaviour when the mass accretion rate changes by several orders of magnitude over a period of week , or shorter ( gladstone , done & gierliski 2007 ) . the x - ray spectral evolution in the hid correlates with the x - ray variability properties ( belloni et al .",
    "2005 ) and with properties of the radio emission from a jet ( fender et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + [ tab : tab2 ]      the anti - correlation between @xmath1  and eddington luminosity ratio does not extend to the quiescence .",
    "this conclusion is based on the eddington luminosity ratios and photon indices collected for quiescent accreting gbhs by corbel , tomsick & kaaret ( 2006 , xte  j1118 + 480 , a0620 - 00 , xte  j1550 - 564 , gx 339 - 4 , gro j1655 - 40 , v641 sgr ) .",
    "we included also three measurements for v404 cyg . in two cases , we combined the reported photon indices with the eddington luminosity ratios calculated based on the 0.310 kev xmm - newton unabsorbed flux ( bradley et al .",
    "2007 ) and 39 kev chandra flux ( corbel , koerding & kaaret 2008 ) , assuming @xmath4 and @xmath5 kpc ( corbel et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the third quiescent observation of v404 cyg was originally published by kong et al .",
    "however , it was claimed to be affected by pile - up , so we addopted the pile - up corrected photon index of corbel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and the eddington luminosity ratio as in kong et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "these quiescent measurements of the photon index are consistent with being constant , @xmath6 , as a function of luminosity . in fig .",
    "5 we plot again the hard state data of gro j1655 - 40  and gx 339 - 4  together with @xmath1  calculated based on the quiescent photon indices using the following equation , @xmath7 ( beloborodov 1999b ) .",
    "we conclude that in quiescence the heating - to - cooling compactness ratio saturates at @xmath8 , corresponding to @xmath9 .",
    "we studied two confirmed gbhs , namely gx 339 - 4  and gro j1655 - 40 , considering all their archival _ rxte _  observations until june 2007 .",
    "we focused on a subset of observations , when the photon index was smaller than 2 , i.e. when the sources were mainly in the hard state . during these observations ,",
    "the source luminosity was lower than 10% of the eddington limit in the case of gro j1655 - 40 , and 30% in gx 339 - 4 .",
    "we used traditional x - ray colours and the results of sobolewska et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to determine the spectral evolution of each source .",
    "our results are consistent with what has been observed in the past , for other gbhs and agn as well : the x - ray colour increases , and the photon index _ hardens _ , with increasing luminosity up to the point where @xmath10 . above this point",
    ", the opposite trend is observed : a decrease of the x - ray colour and a softening of the photon index with increasing luminosity .    within the context of thermal comptonisation models for the x - ray production in accreting black holes ,",
    "the photon index is determined by the hard - to - soft compactness ratio , @xmath1 .",
    "the main result of our work is that the observed spectral variations of the two sources , when in the hard state , can be explained if @xmath1  and luminosity are anti - correlated for luminosities below @xmath11 , and positively correlated for luminosities higher than @xmath12 .",
    "the anti - correlation below @xmath12 can be described by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the weighted mean for both objects .",
    "since the compactness ratio , @xmath1 , depends mainly on the geometry of the accretion flow , our results can put constrains on various models that have been proposed to explain the hard x - ray emission in gbhs .",
    "we discuss below some of these constrains and implications of our results .",
    "we note that in the hard state spectra of gbhs the comptonised emission dominates over the emission of the seed photons , so that @xmath15 .      the hard x - rays",
    "could be produced by compton up - scattering of seed photons from a disc illuminating a hot inner flow .",
    "heat conduction from thermal contact of the hot flow and cool disc can lead to evaporation of the inner thin disc , resulting in a truncated thin disc , with a radius of @xmath16 ( czerny , raska & kuraszkiewicz 2004 ) .",
    "we assume that the hot flow is powered by the same mass accretion rate that flows through the thin disc , so that its luminosity is given by the remaining potential energy from the inner edge of the truncated disc , @xmath17 , to the inner edge of the hot flow , @xmath18 .",
    "then ( approximately ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the radiative efficiency of the hot flow relative to that of a thin disc , and is proportional to @xmath21 for a radiatively inefficient flow ( e.g. sharma et al .",
    "2007 ) , and roughly constant for a radiatively efficient flow .",
    "if we assume that @xmath22 , then @xmath23 , which implies that @xmath24 for a radiatively inefficient flow , and @xmath25 for a radiatively efficient flow .",
    "the truncated disc luminosity is @xmath26 , but only part of this is intercepted by the hot comptonisation region , which we assume to be a sphere of radius @xmath27 .",
    "this fraction , @xmath28 , varies with radius , and reaches maximum at the truncation radius of the disc , where @xmath29 . since the disc luminosity peaks at the same radius , the seed photon luminosity for the hot flow is @xmath30 so that @xmath31 and we get that @xmath32 for a radiatively inefficient flow , and proportional to @xmath33 for a radiatively efficient flow . either way",
    ", this predicts that @xmath1 increases as the luminosity decreases , i.e. that the spectrum hardens at lower luminosities . this is due mainly to the rapidly decreasing solid angle subtended by the hot flow to the truncated disc .",
    "however , this is in marked contrast to the observed _ softening _ of the spectrum seen at the lowest luminosities , followed by the saturation in quiescence , ruling out this scenario as the physical mechanism for the observed x - ray emission at luminosities below @xmath12 .",
    "however , this could instead explain the observed behaviour above @xmath12 , where the spectrum abruptly softens with increasing luminosity . hence , there must be a transition to another mechanism at @xmath12 to explain the change in @xmath1  behaviour .",
    "there are also seed photons generated in the hot flow itself , by cyclo - synchroton radiation of the energetic electrons .",
    "this emission is strongly self absorbed for thermal electrons , so it peaks at the self absorption frequency @xmath34 , given where the cyclo - synchrotron emissivity equals that of a blackbody .",
    "the full equation for this is complex ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "however , wardziski & zdziarski ( 2000 ) give a numerical approximation for this frequency , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the dimensionless temperature and optical depth of the electrons in the hot flow , and @xmath38 is the magnetic field .",
    "at the observed temperatures , @xmath34 should be on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody , so the flux at this point is @xmath39 .",
    "thus the seed photon luminosity @xmath40 .",
    "the hard luminosity is as before , with @xmath41 , hence @xmath42 .",
    "we get a further constraint as @xmath1 is also set by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "pietrini & krolik ( 1995 ) give an approximation for this of @xmath43 .",
    "this gives @xmath44 . in a radiatively inefficient flow ,",
    "the gas pressure is set by the ion temperature , which remains approximately constant around the virial temperature .",
    "hence @xmath45 is constant if the magnetic pressure is a constant fraction of the gas pressure .",
    "hence @xmath46 if @xmath47 .",
    "this is somewhat faster than the observed @xmath48 , but given the level of approximation this at least describes the observed trend below @xmath12 for the spectrum to soften as the luminosity decreases .",
    "however , this alone does not give a framework for the change in behaviour at higher luminosities , where the spectrum dramatically softens with increasing luminosity .",
    "thus neither seed photons from the disc nor self produced synchrotron self compton photons from the flow can explain the full range of observed behaviour , though the combination of the two ( seed photons from the disc changing to seed photons from cyclo - synchrotron as luminosity decreases ) can explain the observations .",
    "the saturation observed in quiescence is not expected if the electron distribution in the hot flow is thermal .",
    "however , it is likely that the electron distribution is not a pure maxwellian .",
    "evidence for the presence of a non - thermal high energy tail in the electron distribution was found in the hard state of several black hole binaries ( mcconnell et al .",
    "2002 ; wardziski et al . 2002 ; cadolle bel et al . 2006 ; joinet et al . 2007 ; droulans et al . 2010 ) .",
    "consequently , in quiescence , while the plasma becomes optically thin ( due to decreasing @xmath49 ) , the comptonised component becomes dominated by the contribution arising through scattering on the non - thermal high - energy electrons , and the evolution of @xmath50 ( and hence @xmath1 ) depends on the microphysics of particle acceleration in the corona .",
    "particle acceleration with a slope that does not depend on @xmath49 would result in a saturation of @xmath1 .",
    "an outflowing hot corona above an untruncated disc is an alternative geometry to explain the observed hard spectra seen in the hard state ( beloborodov 1999a ; malzac et al .",
    "2001 ) . here",
    "the seed photons for compton scattering are from the disc , but are suppressed by relativistic beaming from the mildly outflowing corona .    in the original model of beloborodov ( 1999a ) ,",
    "the intrinsic disc emission is assumed to be negligible compared to reprocessed radiation produced by the disc illumination by the x - ray source .",
    "then @xmath1 depends mainly on the outflow velocity ( as well as a few geometric parameters ) .",
    "as the velocity is increases , beaming reduces the illumination of the disc and the soft photon flux returning to the outflow . therefore , as the velocity increases , the ratio @xmath1 increases , and the reflected fraction decreases .",
    "we also note that in the outflowing corona model , the luminosity of the corona is amplified by relativistic beaming and this affects the shape of the observed correlations between @xmath51 and luminosity .",
    "the observed spectral softening ( and correlated increase in reflected fraction : e.g. gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 1999 ; ibragimov et al .",
    "2005 ) seen above @xmath12 can be explained in this model if the outflow velocity ( and hence @xmath1 ) decreases as luminosity increases .",
    "the change in behaviour below @xmath12 then requires that the outflow velocity decreases as luminosity decreases .",
    "this makes a clear prediction that at the lowest luminosities where the beaming is negligible , the continuum should be accompanied by a substantial reflected emission from an untruncated disc and @xmath52 should saturate , as observed .",
    "alternatively , the softening of the spectrum below @xmath12 could also be caused by an increase in intrinsic emission from the disc such that this dominates over the reprocessed emission as the source of seed photons .",
    "the outflow velocity could then remain high , or even continue to increase as luminosity decreases .",
    "this predicts that the reflected fraction remains small , but that the observed fraction of power dissipated in the disc should increase .",
    "another type of emission suggested to explain the hard x - ray spectrum is direct non - thermal synchrotron radiation from a jet ( markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 ) . both , thermal comptonisation and jet models can reproduce the shape and observed energy range of the spectral cut - offs seen in the hard states ( e.g. zdziarski et al . 2003 ; markoff & nowak 2004 ) . in several black hole binaries",
    "the cut - off energy was reported to anti - correlate with luminosity in a bright hard state ( e.g. wardziski et al .",
    "2002 ; rodriguez , corbel & tomsick 2003 ; miyakawa et al .",
    "2008 ; joinet , kalemci & senziani 2008 ; motta , belloni & homan 2009 ) .",
    "this can be explained rather naturally in terms of thermal comptonisation models by enhanced cooling by the disc photons .",
    "thus , it seems likely that thermal comptonisation does dominate at @xmath53 .",
    "it is then possible that the transition in spectral behaviour seen at @xmath12 marks the point at which non - thermal emission from the jet starts to dominate over thermal comptonisation from the hot flow ( russell et al .",
    "2010 ) , and theoretical models of jet dominated accretion flows ( e.g. falcke & markoff 2000 ; markoff et al . 2001 ; yuan , markoff & falcke 2002 ) certainly predict that the kinetic power of the jet exceeds the radiative luminosity ( see also malzac , merloni & fabian 2004 ; malzac , belmont & fabian 2009 ) .",
    "however , the photon index of the x - ray emission then depends on the photon index of the non - thermal electrons within the jet , so to explain the spectral softening with decreasing luminosity requires that the electron heating / cooling processes result in a steeper electron distribution .",
    "there are currently no real constraints on this , due to the lack of knowledge of jet physics .    in quiescence , similarly to the case of non - thermal comptonisation dominating the x - ray in the scenario involving thermal inner flow and cyclo - synchrotron seeds , the saturation of @xmath1",
    "can be explained in the jet model if the slope of accelerated non - thermal particles in the jet is independent on @xmath49 .",
    "we show that in the hard state of gbhs the compactness ratio @xmath1   reaches maximum at @xmath54 . for @xmath55 , we find that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the weighted slope and intercept based on the fits to the data of gro j1655 - 40  and gx 339 - 4 .",
    "we suggest that the change of the behaviour in the @xmath1  vs. luminosity relation is caused by a change in the x - ray emission mechanism for the hard state spectra of gbhs .",
    "the relation does not extend to the quiescent state . instead , a saturation of @xmath1  is observed at a value of @xmath59 .",
    "the observed hard state evolution of @xmath1  can be explained if the seed photons are cyclo - synchrotron photons up to @xmath12 , above which they are replaced with the truncated disc photons .",
    "alternatively , the observed variability of @xmath1  can be explained in the case of an outflowing corona if the outflow velocity increases with luminosity up to @xmath12 and then decreases with increasing luminosity , or if the seed intrinsic disc photons are replaced with the reprocessed photons above @xmath12 .",
    "finally , in the scenario involving an x - ray emitting jet , the observed transition in @xmath1  behaviour may mark the point at which the non - thermal jet emission starts dominating over the thermal comptonisation emission .",
    "observed saturation of @xmath1  in quiescence can be explained in terms of an untruncated disc model with cyclo - synchrotron seed ( and in the jet model ) if the non - thermal particles in the corona ( jet ) are accelerated with a slope that is independent on @xmath49 .",
    "the outflowing corona model naturally predicts the quiescent saturation of @xmath1  if the outflow velocity decreases with luminosity below @xmath12 .",
