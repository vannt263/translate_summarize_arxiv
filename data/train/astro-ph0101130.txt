    "the deformation of light beams produced by gravitational tidal fields is responsible for the cosmological weak lensing signal ( or cosmic shear ) produced by large - scale structures of the universe .",
    "the statistical properties of the gravity - induced convergence , @xmath1 ( the projected mass density ) and shear , @xmath2 ( the distortion ) primarily depend on the normalization of the power spectrum of mass density fluctuations , @xmath3 , and on the density parameters , @xmath4 , and can be used to constrain cosmological scenarios .",
    "bernardeau et al @xcite showed that the sensitivity of cosmological models to these quantities is well described by the variance and the skewness of @xmath1 averaged over the angular scale @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the redshift of sources .",
    "hence , a cosmic shear survey which would focus on the measurement of the variance and the skewness of @xmath1 should recover both @xmath4 and @xmath3 independently .",
    "+ although the gravitational convergence is very weak , on angular scales smaller than 10 arc - minutes it is enhanced by the the non - linear gravitational structures , which increase the lensing signal by a significant amount ( see jain & seljak 1997 , @xcite ) . on those scales , the cosmological weak lensing can already be measured from the gravity - induced ellipticity of galaxies ( the shear ) even with ground - based telescopes . in fact , as it is shown by van waerbeke et al 1999 ( @xcite ) and in table [ sizesurvey ] , one needs to cover about one deg@xmath11 up to @xmath12 in order to measure cosmic shear on small scales .",
    "+ four teams recently presented first results .",

    "the vlt sample is defined in order to get a large number of fields separated from each other by an angular distance as large as possible .",
    "this criterion enables us to minimize the cosmic variance .",
    "the selection of the field sample is optimized as follows :    * no stars brighter than 8th magnitude inside a circle of 1 degree around the fors field , and no stars brighter than 14th magnitude inside the fors field , in order to avoid light scattering ; * no extended bright galaxies in the field .",
    "their extended halo may contaminate the shape of galaxies located nearby ; * neither rejection of over - dense regions , where clusters or groups of galaxies could be present , nor primarily selection towards empty fields .",
    "otherwise , the sample could be biased toward under - dense regions with systematically low value of the convergence ; * angular separation between each pointing larger than 5 degrees in order to minimize the correlation between fields ; * field must be galactic latitudes lower than @xmath16 in order to get enough stars per field for the psf correction .",
    "we selected 50 fors1 fields , each covering 6.8@xmath136.8. the total field of view is 0.64 deg@xmath11 and the pointings are randomly spread over more than 1000 deg@xmath11 .",

    "+ the observations were obtained with fors1 on the vlt / ut1 ( antu ) at the paranal observatory in i - band only .",

    "note that thanks to the service mode observation , the vlt sample provides the most homogeneous sample we have . from this sample , we extracted 76,000 galaxies .",
    "due to the severe selection criteria used for cosmic shear , the final sample only has 50,000 galaxies .",
    "so far , four teams have completed a cosmic shear survey .",
    "each of them observed different fields of view and used different instruments and techniques to get and to analyze the data ( see table [ summarysurvey ] ) .",
    "the cfht and vlt surveys reported in van waerbeke et al @xcite and maoli et al @xcite respectively consist in two independent data sets .",
    "we used them also to cross - check our results and to explore the reliability of our corrections of systematics .",
    "the vlt sample complements our cfht data which has the same depth , covers a much larger area ( 1.7 deg@xmath11 ) but only contains 5 uncorrelated fields .",
    "the use of both set of data simultaneously represents 75% of the total number of fields and 40% of the total area covered by all cosmic shear surveys . +",

    "the results plotted in figure [ shearfigmodel ] confirm that the standard cdm predictions are incompatible with most observations , including cosmic shear .",
    "in contrast , cosmic shear predictions of most realistic cluster normalized models are all satisfactory , at least on scales ranging from 0.5 to 10 arc - minutes .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore more thoroughly a large set of models in a ( @xmath31,@xmath3 ) space by using the five cosmic shear results simultaneously .",
    "the full sample contains 75 uncorrelated fields and covers 5.5 deg.@xmath11 , so it can already provide reliable informations .",
    "+ since the five samples are independent , each provides one single measurement point to perform a simple @xmath32 minimization in the ( @xmath31,@xmath3 ) plane . from each sample",
    "we choose only one point corresponding to the angular scale where the signal has the best signal - to - noise , taking care to discard the large scale measures , as they are likely affected by finite size effects ( see szapudi & colombi 1996,@xcite ) .",
    "we extracted five triplets containing the scale , the variance and the 1-@xmath33 error , ( @xmath34 , @xmath35,@xmath36 ) reported on figure [ shearfigmodel ] ) and computed :    @xmath37 ^ 2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is the predicted variance for a given cosmological model .",
    "we computed it for 150 models inside the box @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the result is given in figure [ chi2model ] .",

    "we fitted the best models by the empirical law : @xmath41 in the range @xmath42 arc - minutes which is found to be is in good agreement with @xcite who predicted @xmath43 at non - linear scales .",
    "moreover , this is very close to the cluster normalization constraints given in @xcite ( for closed models and @xmath44 ) : @xmath45 although the two methods are totally independent .",
    "the interpretation of the remarkable agreement between the cluster abundance and the cosmic shear analysis may be the following .",
    "the empirical law found from cluster abundance closely follows theoretical expectation of a gaussian initial density fluctuations field ( white et al 1993 , @xcite ) .",
    "since the amplitude of cosmic shear signal on scales smaller than 10 arc - minutes mainly probes non - linear mass density contrast like groups and clusters , the similarity between both empirical laws strengthens the assumptions that mass density fluctuations grew from a gaussian field .",
    "+ although encouraging , our interpretation of cosmic shear results depends on critical shortcomings .",
    "we only have five independent data points spread over a rather small angular scale and we do not have serious estimates on the redshift of the sources .",
    "assuming they are at @xmath21 is a reasonable assumption ( @xcite ) , but it is still uncertain and needs further confirmations .",
    "we also neglected the cosmic variance in the error budget of the cosmic shear sample .",
    "it does not affect the vlt data which contain 50 uncorrelated fields and , likely , the bacon et al ( @xcite ) observations ( because they estimated the cosmic variance using a gaussian field hypothesis ) .",
    "the three other measures are probably more affected , although numerical simulations indicate that cosmic variance should only increase our error bars by less than a factor of two ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the solid line shows the local cluster abundance best fit ( @xcite ) .",

    "although cosmic shear surveys started less than two years ago , they went incredibly fast to provide consistent measurements on small scales . the study discussed in this",
    "proceeding goes even further .",
    "it both shows the important immediate potential of cosmic shear for cosmology and the fact that fors1 in service mode is one of the best instrument for this project .",
    "it enables to get a homogeneous data set on a very large sample of uncorrelated fields .",
    "+ on figure [ sumnbvlt ] , we have simulated the amount of data one would need in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio by a factor of 3 .",
    "it turns out that with 300 fors1 fields obtained in service mode ( that is , 250 more fields than what we got , or 160 hours of antu / fors1 in service mode ) the separation between most popular model would be striking .",
    "if the vmos instrument ( le fvre et al 2000 , @xcite ) provides similar image quality , one can imagine even more impressive results up to angular scales of 15 arc - minutes .",
    "the join use of both cfht and vlt data would therefore be spectacular .",
