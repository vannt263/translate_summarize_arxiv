    "difficile de construire des exemples analytiques rels .",
    "on sait ( @xcite ) que le maximum de la courbure scalaire intervient dans le dveloppement asymptotique du profil prs de 0 .",
    "une condition suffisante pour que le profil soit lisse au voisinage de 0 est que ce maximum soit atteint en un seul point , et que celui - ci soit un point critique non dgnr , voir @xcite .",
    "sous cette hypothse supplmentaire , nous montrons que demander un profil lisse est trs restrictif .",

    "the _ isoperimetric profile _ of a riemannian manifold @xmath0 is the function @xmath1 which maps @xmath2 to the infimum @xmath3 of boundary volumes of domains of volume equal to @xmath4 .",
    "very few profiles of compact riemannian manifolds are exactly known ( @xcite contains a state of the art ) . among those",
    ", only the round sphere has a smooth profile .",
    "we address here the differentiability question : does every compact manifold admit a metric with smooth profile ? in @xcite ,",
    "smooth metrics with smooth profiles are constructed on 2-dimensional manifolds , provided they have enough ends .",
    "it is likely that similar examples can be found on many compact manifolds .",
    "however , it seems much harder to produce real analytic metrics with smooth profiles .",
    "it is known ( @xcite ) that the asymptotics of the isoperimetric profile near 0 is determined by the maximum of scalar curvature . a sufficient condition for the profile to be smooth near 0 is that this maximum be achieved at only one point , which is a nondegenerate critical point , see @xcite . under this assumption , we show that having a smooth profile is very restrictive .
