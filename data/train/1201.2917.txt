    "after more than one year of successful running of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , the data released by the two experiments , atlas and cms have not only improved on some of the limits set by the tevatron experiments , but has already started giving some insights into the tev scale .",
    "so far the results have proved to be consistent with predictions from the standard model ( sm ) with not much deviation which means that the lhc data is already pushing the energy frontier of any beyond standard model ( bsm ) physics predictions .",
    "as expected the lhc data would be most sensitive to the strongly interacting sector with strong limits obtained from resonant searches of new physics exchanged in the s - channel .",
    "as the initial states at hadron colliders are colored particles , the most dominant contributions would be through new colored resonances as their couplings would be typically of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "such colored particles are predicted in many class of bsm theories such as  squarks \" in r - parity violating supersymmetric theories @xcite ,  diquarks \" in super - string inspired @xmath10 grand unification models @xcite ,  excited quarks \" in composite models @xcite , models with color - sextet fermions @xcite , color - octet vectors such as axigluons @xcite and colorons @xcite , models with color - triplet @xcite , color - sextet @xcite or color - octet scalars @xcite .    these resonant states",
    "when produced will decay to two light jets leading to modification of the dijet differential cross - section at large invariant mass .",
    "both atlas and cms collaborations have looked at the dijet signal and already put strong constraints on such resonances @xcite .",
    "the most current bounds reported by the atlas experiment with data corresponding to 1.0 fb@xmath7 integrated luminosity at 95% c.l .",
    "are @xmath11 tev for excited quarks , @xmath12 tev for axigluons and @xmath13 tev for color - octet scalars @xcite while the cms collaboration with the same amount of data reports lower bounds of @xmath14 tev for the @xmath10 diquarks , @xmath15 tev for the excited quarks , @xmath16 tev for the axigluons and colorons.@xcite .",
    "we note that another interesting prospect other than the dijet signal at lhc would be the modifications to the top quark signal due to exchanges from such colored particles .",
    "we are interested in particular with particles of the  diquark \" type which carry non - zero baryon number and couple to a pair of quarks or anti - quarks .",
    "a lot of studies exist in the literature for such diquarks and their resonant effects in the dijet signals @xcite and pair production of top quarks @xcite at the lhc .",

    "such particles will be copiously produced as s - channel resonances and thus contribute to the dijet final state .",

    "we are interested in new elementary particles that couple to a pair of quarks directly which would imply that they carry exotic baryon number .",
    "as the lhc is a proton - proton machine , the initial states comprised of the the valence quarks would lead to enhanced flux in the parton distributions for the collision between a pair of valence quarks such as @xmath19 or @xmath20 . any new particle that couples to these pairs would carry a baryon number @xmath21 and",

    "[ fig : minv ] ( a ) and ( b ) , the distributions for the diquark mediated process for the invariant mass of the two @xmath3-jets @xmath96 and the leading @xmath3-jet with the charged lepton @xmath97 would peak for larger values and drop rapidly as it approaches the diquark mass which acts as an upper bound for the invariant mass value .",
    "the sm contributions however fall off very rapidly for large invariant mass in these particle pairs which is remnant of the fact that there are no heavy tev mass particle in sm that can cause such a behavior .",
    "however , the invariant mass distribution for the sub - leading @xmath3-jet and the charged lepton has an upper cut - off at the top mass ( @xmath98 ) for the diquark mediated process since the two particles almost always originate from the decay of the top quark and so the invariant mass of the decay products can never be greater than the mass of the mother particle .",

    "[ fig : minv ] ( c ) .",
    "note that the sm distribution has a long tail as there are other contributions which get superposed on the single top channel contribution making it significantly different from that of the diquark mode .",
    "the dependence of the differential cross section on the different kinematic variables gives us a hint as to what should be the additional kinematic selection on the final state events which would make the diquark effects stand out against the sm contributions .",
    "we find that the most effective selection turns out to be the transverse momenta of the leading @xmath3-jet which originates from the decay of the diquark itself .",
    "we find that a more stringent requirement that the leading @xmath3-jet satisfies @xmath99 gev is very helpful in achieving a greater suppression of the sm background without affecting the diquark contributions significantly . with this additional cut ,",
    "the sm background is reduced to @xmath100 fb while the contribution for the diquark with mass @xmath68 tev is reduced only by 7% and that with mass @xmath69 tev is reduced only by 4% , thus significantly increasing the sensitivity to the diquark effects in the single top channel .",
    "the other promising variables are the @xmath92 and the invariant mass distribution of the two @xmath3-jets and that between the leading @xmath3-jet and the charged lepton which show significant difference between the diquark contribution and the sm background and will increase the signal significance with appropriate selection cuts when combined with the @xmath85 selection .",
    "we have simulated the events for diquark contribution and the sm background for the final state @xmath80 at lhc with @xmath101 tev for two values of the integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath7 and 10 fb@xmath7 .",

    "[ significance ] ( a ) we show the sensitivity of lhc in the @xmath109 parameter plane at @xmath110 statistical significance using the basic selection cuts discussed in sec . [ sec : pheno ] . for @xmath111 , we find that the lhc can rule out diquark of mass @xmath112 tev with data corresponding to 1 fb@xmath7 of integrated luminosity while the reach becomes @xmath113 tev with data corresponding to 10 @xmath114 with the same set of cuts .",
    "this reach is improved if we include the strong cut on the transverse momenta of the leading @xmath3-jet of @xmath115 gev , which we show in fig .",
    "[ significance ] ( b ) .",
    "we find that with an integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath7 which is already collected by each of the two experiments at lhc , the vector diquark mass accessible to lhc at @xmath110 statistical significance would be @xmath116 tev while the reach expands to @xmath117 tev with @xmath118 fb@xmath7 .",
    "thus we find that the single top channel with the appropriate cuts competes quite well with the dijet channel and can prove to be an improvement over the dijet channel if the coupling of the diquarks to the third generation quarks is larger than its coupling to the first two generations .",
    "in this work we have studied the single top quark production at the lhc running at @xmath101 tev .",
    "we have considered the effects of a vector diquark resonance on the single top quark production ( @xmath119 ) and compared it with the sm background for the @xmath120 final state , where the top decays semileptonically .",
    "we find that there could be large enhancements in the single top quark production at lhc and find that various kinematic distributions effectively capture the essence of a heavy particle exchange which distinguish it from sm background .",
    "we have shown that the use of specific selection cuts on the kinematics of the final states can lead to improved significance for the effects of the diquark exchange and increase the lhc sensitivity to heavier diquark mass .",
    "we also note that for the vector diquark coupling more strongly to the third generation quarks than the first two generations , the lhc can be sensitive to higher values of the diquark mass when compared to the dijet channel .    in this work ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the study of the sextet vector diquark exchange and we note that similar results can be also obtained for the triplet vector diquark or the scalar diquarks @xcite which contribute to the single top quark production at the lhc . the vector diquark effects on the top quark polarization would be different from that of a scalar diquark exchange @xcite as the lorentz structure at the interaction vertices will be different which can prove to be a good discriminant in distinguishing the vector from the scalar exchange @xcite .",
