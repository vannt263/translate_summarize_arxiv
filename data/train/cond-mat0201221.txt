    "our predictions completely agree with the known exact and rigorous results in two dimensions  @xcite , and are equally valid also in three dimensions . in  @xcite , we have compared our results to some monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and experiments  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the actually discussed mc data for 3d ising  @xcite and @xmath16  @xcite models are fully consistent with our theoretical predictions , but not with those of the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) theory  @xcite . from the theoretical and mathematical point of view , the invalidity of the conventional rg expansions has been demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "the current paper , dealing with numerical transfer - matrix analysis of the two  point correlation function in 2d ising model , as well as with the analysis of mc data for the three  dimensional ising , @xmath17 and xy models , presents a more general confirmation that the correct values of critical exponents are those predicted by the gfd theory .",

    "the correction  to  scaling exponent @xmath36 for the susceptibility is also relevant .",
    "the susceptibility is related to the correlation function in the fourier representation @xmath37 , i.  e. , @xmath38  @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", this relation makes sense at @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the critical temperature . according to our theory ,",
    "@xmath41 can be expanded in a taylor series of @xmath42 at @xmath43 . in this case",
    "the reduced temperature @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 .",

    "@xcite , but , according to the final result represented by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) and  ( [ eq : nu ] ) , @xmath47 is a natural number . some of the expansion coefficients can be zero , so that in general we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 may have integer values 1 , 2 , 3 , etc .",
    "one can expect that @xmath50 holds at @xmath29 ( which yields @xmath51 at @xmath52 and @xmath53 at @xmath54 ) and the only nonvanishing corrections are those of the order @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , since the known corrections to scaling for physical quantities , such as magnetization or correlation length , are analytical in the case of the two  dimensional ising model . here",
    "we suppose that the confluent corrections become analytical , i.  e. @xmath36 takes the value @xmath58 , at @xmath52 .",
    "besides , similar corrections to scaling are expected for susceptibility @xmath59 and magnetization @xmath60 since both these quantities are related to @xmath61 , i.  e. , @xmath38 and @xmath62 hold where @xmath63 is the volume and @xmath4 is the linear size of the system .",
    "the above limit is meaningful at @xmath64 , but @xmath65 may be considered as a definition of @xmath66 for finite systems too .",
    "the latter means that corrections to finite ",
    "size scaling for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are similar at @xmath67 . according to the scaling hypothesis and finite ",
    "size scaling theory , the same is true for the discussed here corrections at @xmath43 , where in both cases ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) the definition @xmath68 is valid .",
    "thus , the expected expansion of the susceptibility @xmath59 looks like @xmath69 .",
    "our hypothesis is that @xmath70 and @xmath71 monotoneously increase with @xmath20 to fit the known exponents for the spherical model at @xmath72 .",
    "the analysis of the mc and experimental results here and in  @xcite enables us to propose that @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath30 hold at least at @xmath75 .",
    "these relations , probably , are true also at @xmath76 .",
    "this general hypothesis is consistent with the idea that the critical exponents @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath36 can be represented by some analytical functions of @xmath20 which are valid for all natural positive @xmath20 and yield @xmath77 rather than @xmath78 with @xmath79 ( @xmath80 must be a natural number to avoid a contradiction , i.  e. , irrational values of @xmath81 at natural @xmath20 ) at @xmath72 . at these conditions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are linear functions of @xmath20 ( with integer coefficients ) such that @xmath83 at @xmath72 , and @xmath84 is constant . besides , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 hold to coincide with the known results at @xmath29 . then",

    "the expansion of @xmath37 by itself contains a nonvanishing term of order @xmath88 ( in the form @xmath89 $ ] whith @xmath90 , since @xmath91 holds in the case of susceptibility ) to compensate the corresponding correction term ( produced by @xmath92 ) in the equation for @xmath93 ( cf .",
    "the latter means , e.  g. , that the correlation length @xmath94 estimated from an approximate ansatz like @xmath95 $ ] used in  @xcite also contains a correction proportional to @xmath96 . since @xmath97 has a rather small value , the presence of such a correction ( and , presumably , also the higher order corrections @xmath98 , @xmath99 , etc . ) makes the above ansatz unsuitable for an accurate numerical correction  to  scaling analysis .",
    "the correction @xmath96 is related to the correction @xmath100 in the finite  size scaling expressions at criticality .",
    "the existence of such a correction in the asymptotic expansion of the critical real  space green s ( correlation ) function is confirmed by our results for the 2d  ising model discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] .",
    "our consideration can be generalized easily to the case where the hamiltonian parameter @xmath22 is a nonlinear analytical function of @xmath23 .",
    "nothing is changed in the above expansions if the reduced temperature @xmath44 , as before , is defined by @xmath101 . however , analytical corrections to scaling appear ( and also corrections like@xmath102 with integer @xmath84 and @xmath20 ) if @xmath44 is reexpanded in terms of @xmath103 at @xmath104 .",
    "the solution at the critical point remains unchanged , since the phase transition occurs at the same ( critical ) value of @xmath22 .",
    "the transfer matrix method , applied to analytical calculations on two  dimensional lattices , is well known  @xcite .",
    "however , no analytical methods exist for an exact calculation of the correlation function in 2d ising model .",
    "this can be done numerically by adopting the conventional transfer matrix method and modifying it to reach the maximal result ( calculation of as far as possible larger system ) with minimal number of arithmetic operations , as discussed further on .",

    "we have applied this method to one of the recent and most accurate numerical data for the susceptibility in 3d ising model , and have got a confirmation that our critical exponents are true .",

    "<S> the corrections to finite - size scaling in the critical two - point correlation function @xmath0 of 2d ising model on a square lattice have been studied numerically by means of exact transfer  matrix algorithms . the systems of square geometry with periodic boundaries oriented either along @xmath1 or along @xmath2 direction have been considered , including up to 800 spins . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath0 at a distance @xmath3 equal to the half of the system size @xmath4 shows the existence of an amplitude correction @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a nontrivial correction @xmath6 of a very small magnitude also has been detected in agreement with predictions of our recently developed gfd ( grouping of feynman diagrams ) theory . </S>",
    "<S> a refined analysis of the recent mc data for 3d ising , @xmath7 , and xy lattice models has been performed . </S>",
    "<S> it includes an analysis of the partition function zeros of 3d ising model , an estimation of the correction  to  scaling exponent @xmath8 from the binder cumulant data near criticality , as well as a study of the effective critical exponent @xmath9 and the effective amplitudes in the asymptotic expansion of susceptibility at the critical point . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> a refined analysis is consistent with our ( gfd ) asymptotic values of the critical exponents ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 for 3d ising model and @xmath13 for 3d xy model ) , while the actually accepted `` conventional '' exponents are , in fact , effective exponents which are valid for approximation of the finite  size scaling behavior of not too large systems .    </S>",
