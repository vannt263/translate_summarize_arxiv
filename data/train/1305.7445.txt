    "along this paper , we consider a _ multiplex network _",
    "@xmath0 , made of @xmath1 _ layers _ @xmath2 , such that each layer is a ( directed or undirected ) un - weighted network @xmath3 , with @xmath4 ( i.e. all layers have the same @xmath5 nodes ) .",
    "the * transpose * of the adjacency matrix of each layer @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the _ projection network _ associated to @xmath0 is the graph @xmath11 , where @xmath12 the * transpose * of the adjacency matrix of @xmath13 will be denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "note that for every @xmath9 @xmath15    the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will introduce different heuristic arguments suggesting proper ways of measuring centrality in multiplex networks .",
    "section iii is devoted to establishing , under reasonable conditions , the existence and consistency of the proposed measures of centrality . in section iv",
    ", we report some computer experiments and simulations showing how the introduced measures provide substantially different results when applied to the same multiplex networks .",
    "these results are discussed in the concluding section .",
    "in the case of a multiplex network , the central question to be addressed is the following : how can one take into account all the interactions between the different subnetworks ( channels , communities , layers ... ) bearing in mind that not all of them have the same importance ?",
    "it is essential , indeed , to remark that in order to get the centrality of a node it is necessary to take into account how the centrality ( importance , influence , ... ) of a node is propagated within the whole network through different channels ( layers ) that are not necessarily additives .",
    "for instance , worldwide social networks ( such as facebook or twitter ) are characterized by very heterogeneous interactions , which are also typical of interactions among units in fields as diverse as climate systems @xcite , game theory @xcite , interacting infrastructures @xcite and many others ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    with reference to the network @xmath0 , for each layer , one can consider the classical eigenvector centrality @xmath6 as the principal eigenvector of @xmath16 ( if it exists ) .",
    "specifically , the eigenvector centrality of a node @xmath17 within the layer @xmath6 would be the @xmath18 entry of the positive definite and normalized vector @xmath19 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath16 . in a similar way",
    ", the eigenvector centrality of the projection network @xmath13 will be the principal eigenvector of @xmath20 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of these vectors are guaranteed by the perron - frobenius theorem for any symmetric matrix with positive entries .",
    "interestingly , the perron - frobenius theorem can conveniently be extended to multiplex networks , leading to even deeper concepts of nodes centrality .",
    "we remark that other extensions of the perron - frobenius theorem have been proposed for hypergraphs and nonnegative tensors ( @xcite ) .",
    "once all the eigenvector centralities are computed , one can consider the _ independent layer _",
    "eigenvector - like centrality of @xmath0 ( abbreviated as the independent layer centrality of @xmath0 ) as the matrix @xmath21 notice that @xmath22 is column stochastic , since @xmath23 and @xmath24 for every @xmath10 .",
    "bearing in mind that the centrality ( importance ) of a node must be proportional to the centrality of its neighbors ( lying on all layers ) , and considering that all layers have the same importance , one has that @xmath25 this allows defining the _ uniform eigenvector - like centrality _",
    "( abbrev . the uniform centrality ) as the positive and normalized eigenvector @xmath26 ( if it exists ) of the matrix @xmath27 given by @xmath28    this situation occurs , for instance , in social networks , where different individuals may have different relationships with other people , while one is generically interested in measuring the centrality of the network of acquaintances .    going a step further , one may consider that layers are associated with different levels of importance ( or influence ) in different layers of the network , and to include this sort of information in the matrix accounting for the mutual influence between layers .",
    "thus , in order to calculate the importance ( or influence ) of a node within a specific layer , one must also take into account also all other layers , as some of them may be relevant for that calculation .",
    "consider , for instance , the case of a boss going to the same gym as one of his employees : the relationship between the two fellows within the gym layer has a totally different nature from that occurring inside the office layer , but the role of the boss ( i.e. his centrality ) in this case can be even bigger than if he was the only one person of the office frequenting that gym . in other words , one needs to consider the situation where the influence amongst layers is heterogeneous .    to this purpose",
    ", one can introduce an _ influence matrix _ @xmath29 as a non - negative matrix @xmath30 such that @xmath31 measures the influence _ of _ the layer @xmath32 _ on _ the layer @xmath33 . once @xmath0 and @xmath34",
    "have been fixed , one then defines the _ local heterogeneous eigenvector - like centrality _ of @xmath0 ( abbrev .",
    "the local heterogeneous centrality of @xmath0 ) on each layer @xmath6 ( @xmath10 ) as a positive and normalized eigenvector @xmath35 ( if it exists ) of the matrix @xmath36 once again , the _ local heterogeneous eigenvector - like centrality _",
    "( abbreviated as local heterogeneous centrality ) matrix of the multiplex network @xmath0 is defined as @xmath37    another important aspect to be elucidated is that , in general , the centrality of a node @xmath17 within a specific layer @xmath38 may depend not only on the neighbors that are linked to @xmath17 within the layer @xmath38 , but also to all other neighbors of @xmath17 that belong to the other layers .",
    "that is the case of scientific citations in different areas of knowledge ; indeed , imagine two scientists ( a chemist and a physicist ) and one of them has been awarded the nobel prize : the importance of the other scientist will significantly increase , even though the nobel prize laureate had few citations within the other researcher s area .",
    "this heuristic argument leads to the introduction of another concept of centrality : given a multiplex network @xmath0 and an influence matrix @xmath34 , the _ global heterogeneous eigenvector - like centrality _ of @xmath0 ( abbrev .",
    "global centrality of @xmath0 ) is defined as a positive and normalized eigenvector @xmath39 ( if it exists ) of the matrix @xmath40 note that @xmath41 is the khatri - rao product of the matrices @xmath42 in analogy with what has been one before , if one introduces the notation @xmath43 with @xmath44 , then one can define the _ global heterogeneous eigenvector - like centrality matrix _ of @xmath0 as the matrix given by @xmath45 note that , in general @xmath46 is neither column stochastic nor row stochastic , but the sum of all the entries of @xmath46 is 1 .    note also that the matrix @xmath47 may be interpreted as a linear operator from the tensor product @xmath48 to itself , form which @xmath49 is its normalized principal eigenvector . using a tensor algebra approach to represent networks with different types of interactions",
    "is not new .",
    "for example , a multilinear version of perron - frobenius theorem may be used to define the centrality of uniform hypergraphs ( see , for instance , @xcite ) ; furthermore , a perron - frobenius - type theorem for general ( not necessarily uniform ) , irreducible hypergraphs has been proved by @xcite .",
    "let us now move to discussing the conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the centrality measures introduced in the previous section .",
    "the natural question here is whether the strong connectedness of the projected graph @xmath13 or , equivalently , the irreducibility of the nonnegative matrix @xmath20 , is a sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of our centralities measures .",
    "one can make use of the perron - frobenius theorem , as well as on irreducible matrices and strongly connected graphs , for which we refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "in fact , recalling that the graph determined by @xmath50 coincides with the projected graph of the network , in the case of the uniform centrality we immediately get the following    [ thm : ucexist ] if the projected graph @xmath13 of a multiplex network @xmath0 is strongly connected , then the uniform centrality @xmath51 of @xmath0 exists and is unique .",
    "the case of the local heterogeneous centrality is similar , as every row @xmath52 of the matrix @xmath53 is the principal normalized eigenvector of a linear combination @xmath54 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath55 is positive , the graph associated to every @xmath56 is the projected graph of the multiplex network , hence one get also    [ thm : lhcexist ] if the projected graph @xmath13 of a multiplex network @xmath0 is strongly connected , and @xmath57 then the local heterogeneous centrality @xmath53 of @xmath0 exists and is unique .",
    "a more delicate case is that of the global heterogeneous centrality , that is constructed upon the principal normalized eigenvector of the matrix @xmath58    such a matrix is the transpose of the adjacency matrix of a graph with @xmath59 nodes that we denote by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 iff @xmath63 .",
    "unfortunately , even if the projected graph of a multiplex network @xmath0 is strongly connected and @xmath55 is positive , the graph @xmath64 is not , in general , strongly connected .",
    "in fact one can easily check that this is already the case for the example in which @xmath0 consists of two nodes and two layers , with matrices : @xmath65    nevertheless , it is still possible to infer the existence and unicity of @xmath66 from the strong - connectedness of @xmath13 and the positivity of @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , one has first to notice that , if @xmath13 is strongly connected and @xmath55 is positive , then @xmath64 satisfies : @xmath67 now , we denote a node @xmath68 of @xmath64 as a @xmath69-_sink _ when @xmath70 for all @xmath71 , so that the corresponding column of @xmath47 is identically zero .",
    "if a node @xmath68 is not a @xmath69-sink , we claim that , given any other node @xmath72 there exists a path in @xmath64 going from @xmath68 to @xmath72 .",
    "assuming @xmath13 to be strongly connected , there exist then indices @xmath73 such that , for every @xmath74 , there exists an index @xmath75 for which @xmath76 .",
    "thus , by construction , @xmath77 for all @xmath78 , and this finishes the proof of the latter claim .    from these arguments , one may easily deduce that the normal form of the matrix @xmath41 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a permutation matrix and @xmath81 is an irreducible nonnegative matrix , to which the perron - frobenius theorem can be applied .",
    "it follows that the spectrum of @xmath47 is the union of the spectrum of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and that @xmath47 has a unique normalized eigenvector associated to @xmath83 . summing up",
    ", we get the following    [ thm : ghcexist ] if the projected graph @xmath13 of a multiplex network @xmath0 is strongly connected , and @xmath57 then the global heterogeneous centrality @xmath66 of @xmath0 exists and is unique .",
    "we now discuss the consistency of our definitions in a variety of special cases",
    ".    * monoplex networks . *",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate that on a monoplex network ( i.e. a multiplex network consisting of only one layer ) our three concepts of multiplex centrality coincide with the usual eigenvector centrality of the layer .    * identical layers .",
    "* let @xmath0 be a multiplex network for which @xmath84 for every @xmath85 , and note that @xmath86 , for every @xmath38 , so that the uniform centrality of @xmath0 coincides with the eigenvector centrality of every layer @xmath6 .",
    "assuming that every row of @xmath55 is nonnegative ( in particular if @xmath57 ) it is also clear that every column of the local heterogeneous centrality @xmath53 coincides with the uniform centrality @xmath87 of @xmath0 .",
    "the case of the global heterogeneous centrality is slightly different .",
    "if all the layers are identical , the matrix @xmath47 coincides with the so called _ kronecker product _ of the matrices @xmath55 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is well known ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) ) that the spectral radius of @xmath47 is then equal to @xmath88 and that its normalized principal eigenvector is the kronecker product of the normalized principal eigenvectors @xmath89 of @xmath55 and @xmath87 of @xmath20 . in terms of matrices , this is equivalent to say that @xmath90 . in particular , the normalization of all the columns of @xmath66 equals @xmath87 .",
    "* starred layers .",
    "* we finally consider the case in which the multiplex network @xmath0 contains exactly @xmath91 layers , satisfying that the layer @xmath6 consists of a set of edges coming out of the node @xmath92 . in other words , @xmath93 if @xmath94 . in this case",
    "there exists a permutation matrix @xmath80 such that : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the hadamard product ( see , for example @xcite ) of @xmath55 and @xmath20 ( i.e. @xmath97 ) .",
    "in particular the global heterogeneous centrality of @xmath0 is the diagonal @xmath98 matrix whose diagonal is the eigenvector centrality of @xmath96 .",
    "note that @xmath96 can be interpreted as the transpose of the matrix of the graph @xmath13 , in which the edge going from @xmath99 to @xmath17 has been assigned a weight equal to @xmath31 . in this sense the eigenvector centrality of a weighted graph can be seen as a particular case of the global heterogeneous centrality .",
    "in the following two sections we will compute and compare the different types of centrality measures that we have defined for some examples , constructed upon both real and synthetic data . we will start by describing two ways of comparing centrality measures , and then we will apply them to a real example of social multiplex network .",
    "if we take a network of @xmath100 nodes @xmath101 and consider two centrality measures @xmath102 such that the @xmath71-th coordinate of @xmath103 and @xmath104 measure the centrality of node @xmath105 for every @xmath106 , one way of measuring the correlation between @xmath103 and @xmath104 is by computing @xmath107 for some norm @xmath108 . while @xmath107 measures the discrepancy between @xmath103 and @xmath104 , its value is not representative of the _ real _ information about the correlation between @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "note , indeed , that one of the main features of the centrality measures is the fact that they produce _ rankings _ , i.e. in many cases the crucial information obtained from a centrality measure is the fact that a node @xmath105 is more relevant than another node @xmath109 , and this ordering is more important than the actual difference between the corresponding centrality of nodes @xmath105 and @xmath109 .",
    "hence , if we want to analyze the correlations among a set of centrality measures , we should study in detail the correlations between the associated rankings .",
    "the literature suggests various alternative ways to study the correlations between two rankings @xmath110 and @xmath111 , two standard ones being the spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath112 and the kendall s rank correlation coefficient @xmath113 . if we consider two centrality measures @xmath102 of a network with nodes @xmath101 , then each centrality measure @xmath103 and @xmath104 produces a ranking of the nodes that will be denoted by @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "the spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xcite between two centrality measures @xmath103 and @xmath104 is defined as @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the ranking of node @xmath105 with respect to the centrality measures @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , the kendall s rank correlation coefficient @xcite between two centrality measures @xmath103 and @xmath104 is defined as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the number of pairs of nodes @xmath121 such that they appear in the same ordering in @xmath110 and @xmath111 and @xmath122 is the number of pairs of nodes @xmath121 such that they appear in different order in rankings @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "note that both @xmath123 and @xmath124 give values in @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "the closer @xmath123 is to 1 the more correlated @xmath103 and @xmath104 are , while the closer @xmath123 is to 0 the more independent @xmath103 and @xmath104 are ( and similarly for @xmath124 ) .",
    "in addition , if @xmath123 ( or @xmath124 ) is close to @xmath126 then @xmath103 and @xmath104 are anti - correlated .",
    "a further remark comes from the fact that the centrality measures introduced so far are very different from one another , and therefore one has to carefully describe how to compare them .",
    "indeed , on one hand , some _ scalar _ measures introduced in section  [ heuristics ] ( the centrality of the node in the network ) associate a single number to each node of the network , while on the other hand , other _ vectorial _ measures assign a vector to each node @xmath105 ( with each coordinate of the vector measuring the centrality of the node @xmath105 as an actor of a different layer of the multiplex network ) . actually , for a multiplex network @xmath0 of @xmath100 nodes , two scalar centralities ( the eigenvector centrality @xmath127 of the projection graph , and the uniform eigenvector - like centrality @xmath128 ) and three vectorial centralities ( the independent layer centrality @xmath129 , the local heterogeneous centrality @xmath130 , and the global heterogeneous centrality @xmath131 ) have been proposed . to compare these different measures ,",
    "the information contained in each vectorial - type centrality must be aggregated to associate a number to each node .",
    "there are several alternative methods for aggregating information , but we use the convex combination technique as main criterion . for a multiplex network @xmath0 of @xmath100 nodes and @xmath132 layers , we can fix some @xmath133 $ ] such that @xmath134 and compute the aggregated scalar centralities @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the @xmath137th - column of the independent layer centrality @xmath22 and @xmath138 is the @xmath137th - column of the local heterogeneous centrality @xmath139 . note that the value of each @xmath140 can be understood as the _ relative influence _ of the layer @xmath32 in the aggregated scalar centrality of the multiplex network . in our numerics ,",
    "the specific value @xmath141 has been chosen , as we suppose that no extra information about the relative relevance of each layer is available , and therefore the influence of each of them is considered equivalent .",
    "note that @xmath103 and @xmath142 are normalized , since @xmath22 and @xmath139 are column - stochastic .",
    "the case of the global heterogeneous centrality is different , since @xmath46 is not column - stochastic . in this case , since the sum of all entries of @xmath139 is 1 , it is enough to take @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the @xmath137th - column of the global heterogeneous centrality @xmath46 .",
    "consequently , the _ relative influence _ of each layer @xmath32 can be defined as @xmath145 ( i.e. the sum of all the coordinates of @xmath144 ) .",
    "once all the vectorial measures have been aggregated ( and the setting unified ) , we discuss the ranking comparisons .",
    "in addition to the actual correlation among the centrality measures , we analyze the influence of the matrix @xmath55 ( called _ influence matrix _ in section  [ heuristics ] ) used in the definition of the local heterogeneous centrality @xmath139 and in the global heterogeneous centrality @xmath46 . since this matrix @xmath146 is non - negative we consider two families of matrices @xmath147 and @xmath148 given for every @xmath149 by @xmath150 note that while each @xmath151 corresponds to a symmetric influence among the layers , each @xmath152 models an asymmetric influence among the layers of the multiplex network .",
    "we apply now our methods of comparison of the different centralities to a classic example : the social network of the renaissance florentine families in @xmath153 .",
    "the dataset of the network ( that are available in @xcite ) collects information about marriage and business ties among sixteen renaissance florentine families .",
    "this social system can be modelled as a multiplex network with two layers : one related with the business ties ( specifically , recorded financial ties such as loans , credits and joint partnerships ) and other that shows the marriage ties in the total dataset of sixteen families ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these two layers are represented in figure  [ florence01 ] .",
    "@xmath154@xmath154    the comparisons among the different centrality measures for the social multiplex network of the renaissance florentine families is presented in figure  [ florence_centrality ] .",
    "more precisely , we represent the @xmath155-dependent spearman ( in red ) and kendall ( in black ) correlation coefficients among the eigenvector centrality of the projection graph , the uniform centrality , the local heterogeneous centrality and the global heterogeneous centrality , in this particular example .",
    "in this section we illustrate the different behaviour of the introduced centrality measures by testing them against a class of randomly generated multiplex networks .",
    "to do so , instead of considering particular taylor - made examples , we consider random networks from a class of scale - free assortative - inspired synthetic graphs ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , that we will describe later on .",
    "first of all , we briefly describe the method used to construct the synthetic multiplex networks used in the numerical testing , which corresponds to the _ model ii _ of ref .",
    "the model is inspired by the barabsi - albert preferential attachment model @xcite as well as by several bipartite networks models such as the collaboration network model proposed by j.j.ramasco _",
    "@xcite , or the sublinear preferential attachment bipartite model introduced by m.peltomki and m.alava @xcite .",
    "it consists of a growing random model determined by the following rules :    * _ model parameters_. the model has three main parameters : @xmath100 , @xmath132 and @xmath156 .",
    "we set @xmath157 as the minimal number of nodes in the multiplex network and @xmath158 as the number of _ active nodes _ in each layer ( _ i.e. _ nodes that will produce links in each layers ) .",
    "note that if we take @xmath159 , we recover the barabsi - albert model @xcite . in this model @xmath132 will be fixed , but the results are similar for other non - negative integer random variable . finally , we set @xmath160 $ ] as the probability of joining a new node to the growing multiplex network during its construction . * _ initial conditions_. we start with a seed multiplex network made of a single layer @xmath161 of @xmath132 nodes that are linked all to all , ( _ i.e. _ @xmath161 is the complete graph @xmath162 ) .",
    "we can replace the _ all - to - all _ structure by any other structure ( such as a scale free or a erds - rnyi network ) , but the results obtained are similar .",
    "this initial layer @xmath161 will be removed from the final multiplex network @xmath0 , since the _ all - to - all _ structure would make the eigenvector - centrality of the projection graph a bisector . * _ layer composition_. at each time step @xmath163 , a new layer @xmath164 of @xmath132 nodes is added to the multiplex network .",
    "we start by randomly choosing an existing node of the multiplex network with a probability proportional to its degree ( _ preferential election _ ) that we call the _ coordinator node_. therefore if at step @xmath165 , the set of nodes of the multiplex network is @xmath166 , and @xmath167 denotes the degree of node @xmath105 at time @xmath165 in the projection network , then we choose the node @xmath105 randomly and independently with probability @xmath168 once the coordinator node has been chosen , each of the remaining @xmath169 active nodes of @xmath164 will be a new node with probability @xmath156 and an existing node with probability @xmath170 .",
    "already existing nodes are added by choosing them uniformly and independently .",
    "note that we can replace the uniform random selection by other random procedures ( such as preferential selection ) , but the random tests done suggest that the multiplex network obtained have statistically the same structural properties when @xmath100 is large enough ( see @xcite ) . at this step ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath132 nodes @xmath171 that will be the _ active nodes _ of the new layer @xmath164 ( i.e. nodes that will produce links in this layers ) . * _ layer inner - structure_. after fixing the active nodes @xmath171 of the new layer @xmath164 , we have to give its links .",
    "first , we link all the active nodes to the coordinator in order to ensure that all the eigenvector - like centrality are well defined .",
    "we set new links between each pair of active nodes @xmath105 and @xmath109 ( with @xmath172 ) by using a _ random assortative linking strategy _ ( this corresponds to the _ model ii in @xcite _ ) . for every @xmath173 ,",
    "we add randomly the link @xmath174 in proportion to the number of common layers that hold simultaneously @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "hence if we denote by @xmath177 the number of layers that hold simultaneously @xmath175 and @xmath176 at time step @xmath163 ( including @xmath164 ) and by @xmath178 the number of layers that hold @xmath175 at time step @xmath163 ( also including @xmath164 ) , thus the probability of linking node @xmath175 with node @xmath175 is given by @xmath179 for every @xmath173 .",
    "the heuristic behind this model comes from social networks , since the relationships in a new social group are correlated with the previous relationships between the actors in other social groups @xcite .",
    "hence , if two actors that belong to the new social group coincide in many ( previous ) groups , then the probability of being connected in this new group is large .",
    "the model also reflects the fact that if two new actors join their first group , the probability of establishing a relationship between them is high . at the end of this step , the new layer @xmath164 is completely defined . *",
    "finally , we repeat steps _ ( iii ) _ and _ ( iv ) _ until the number of nodes of the multiplex network is at least @xmath100 .    after fixing all the settings of the numerical testings , we perform the comparison for three multiplex networks @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( constructed as above ) , where :    * @xmath180 is a network of 102 nodes ( computed with @xmath183 as initial parameter ) and 13 layers of 10 nodes each ( @xmath184 as initial parameter ) . the probability @xmath185 of adding new active nodes to each layer .",
    "this is an example of a network with a relative small number of active nodes in each layer and such as each node is active in a few number of layers ( since @xmath185 ) .",
    "* @xmath181 is a network of 108 nodes ( computed with @xmath183 as initial parameter ) and 4 layers of 40 nodes each ( @xmath186 as initial parameter ) . the probability @xmath187 of adding new active nodes to each layer . in this case , this is a network with a relative big number of active nodes in each layer and a balanced number of newcomers and experienced nodes as actives nodes in each layer ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "* @xmath182 is a network of 102 nodes ( computed with @xmath183 as initial parameter ) and 6 layers of 60 nodes each ( @xmath188 as initial parameter ) . the probability @xmath189 of adding new active nodes to each layer . in this case",
    ", this is a network with a big number of active nodes in each layer and a very low number of newcomers in each layer ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "for each of these networks we compute the correlation between the eigenvector centrality of the projection graph , and the uniform centrality vs. the local and global heterogeneous centralities . figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig2 ] ) plot the dependency of these correlations with respect to the influence strength @xmath190 $ ] in a family of * symmetric * influence matrices @xmath151 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) and with respect to the influence strength @xmath190 $ ] in a family of * non - symmetric * influence matrices @xmath152 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , exhibiting a similar pattern .",
    "note that this phenomena does not occur in the case of the example considered in section [ comparing ] , since in this case there were deep differences between the symmetric case and the non symmetric one ( see figure [ florence_centrality ] ) .",
    "similar results for the correlations between the heterogeneous centralities and the independent layer centrality are displayed in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "finally , we also report the local heterogeneous centrality vs. the global heterogeneous centrality , under the action of the two families of influence matrices @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( see figure ( [ fig4 ] ) ) .        in all panels spearman and kendall coefficient",
    "are respectively depicted in red and black .",
    "introducing a layer structure on a complex network or , equivalently , distinguishing different types of interactions between its nodes , may significantly vary the behaviour of the network ( cf .",
    "the main goal of this paper is analysing the influence of the layer structure in some eigenvector - like centralities of multiplex networks . in order to that ,",
    "we have introduced several eigenvector centralities that take into account the layer structure by means of a directed graph of influences among layers .",
    "the examples presented in the paper show that the centrality measures introduced are qualitatively different and , in particular , different from the eigenvector centrality of the projected network . in order to measure conveniently these differences ,",
    "we have introduced an algorithm that produces randomly generated multiplex networks and measured the pairwise correlations of the different centralities studied , under different types of influence between layers , according to a parameter @xmath190 $ ] and two distinct types of influence matrix .",
    "we have selected three representative examples from the family of synthetic networks analysed , and presented them here since all the numerical simulations we have performed show similar behaviour .",
    "for the multiplex examples considered , this behaviour may be described as follows :    * the rankings given by the different eigenvector centrality measures introduced in the paper are qualitatively different and hence the corresponding centrality measures are also different . *",
    "the correlations between these new eigenvector centrality measures strongly depend on the structure of the multiplex networks , including the number of layers and the number of nodes per layer . * the results obtained with spearman s and kendall s coefficients are qualitatively equivalent in all the examples considered , although spearman s rank is always slightly higher . * the differences between the heterogeneous ( global , local ) and the flat centralities ( centrality of the projected network , uniform centrality ) are significantly broader for lower values of @xmath155 .",
    "in fact , there is a non - linear relationship between the centrality measures and the strength @xmath155 of the influence between layers . on the other hand , for high values of @xmath155 ,",
    "the behaviour of these particular multiplex networks is similar to the corresponding , monoplex , projected networks . in other words @xmath155 ,",
    "thought of as a measure of the multiplexity of the network , is detected by heterogeneous centrality measures .",
    "* in the synthetic examples considered , the total variation with respect to @xmath155 of the correlation between a heterogeneous and a flat measure grows with the ratio between number of layers and number of nodes of each layer .",
    "* the symmetry of the influence between layers does not play a critical role in the correlations among centrality measures in the randomly generated networks considered .",
    "however , in the example of the florentine families ( in which the number of nodes and layers is small ) the differences between the symmetric and non symmetric case is significant .    in summary",
    ", we introduced several definitions of centrality measures for multiplex networks , and proved that , under reasonable conditions , these centrality measures exist and are unique ( theorems [ thm : ucexist ] , [ thm : lhcexist ] , and [ thm : ghcexist ] ) . computer experiments and simulations performed by using the model introduced in @xcite show that our measures provide substantially different results when applied to the same multiplex networks .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that each of these measures arises from a different heuristic . in this sense ,",
    "the concept of multiplex network may be used to model complex networks of different kinds , so that the most appropriate kind of centrality measure shall be carefully determined in each case .",
    "the authors would like to thank an anonymous referee for useful suggestions , that have helped us to improve the final version of this paper .",
    "we also thank david papo for his valuable comments .",

    "<S> in such a case , it is useful to endow our network with a _ multiplex network _ structure . </S>",
    "<S> this representation reflects the interaction of nodes through multiple layers of links , which can not be captured by the classical single - layer network representation . </S>",
    "<S> this multiplex representation has long been considered by sociologists ( multiplex tie @xcite ) , and although some results concerning multiplex networks modeling and structure have been recently proposed @xcite , the study of centrality parameteres in such networks has not yet been addressed satisfactorily . the aim of this paper is to propose a definition of centrality in multiplex networks , and illustrate potential applications . * </S>"
