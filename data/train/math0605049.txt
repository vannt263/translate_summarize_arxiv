    "the three basic pillars of finance are :    optimal investment ;    pricing and hedging ;    risk measurement and management .",
    "the most well - known financial theories related to the first pillar are the markowitz mean - variance analysis and sharpe s capm , which are often termed the `` first revolution in finance '' .",
    "the most well - known result related to the second pillar is the black",
    " scholes  merton formula , which is often termed the `` second revolution in finance '' .",
    "recently a very important innovation has appeared in connection with the third pillar . in 1997 ,",
    "artzner , delbaen , eber and heath  @xcite , @xcite introduced the concept of a _ coherent risk measure _ as a new way of measuring risk .",
    "since 1997 , the theory of coherent risk measures has rapidly been evolving and is already termed in some sources the `` third revolution in finance '' ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "let us mention , in particular , the papers  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the reviews  @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  4 ) , @xcite .",
    "currently , one of the major tasks is the problem of proper risk measurement in the dynamic setting ; see , in particular ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "the theory of coherent risk measures is important not only for risk measurement .",
    "indeed , risk ( @xmath0 uncertainty ) is at the very basis of the whole finance , and therefore , a new way of looking at risk yields new approaches to other problems of finance , in particular , to those related to the first and the second pillars",
    ". nowadays , more and more research is aimed at _ applications _ of coherent risk measures to other problems of finance .",
    "one of the major goals of modern financial mathematics is providing adequate price bounds for derivative contracts in incomplete markets .",
    "it is known that no arbitrage price bounds in incomplete markets are typically unacceptably wide , and fundamentally new ideas are required to narrow these bounds .",
    "recently , a promising approach to this problem termed _ no good deals _ ( _ ngd _ ) pricing has been proposed in  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate its idea by an example .",
    "consider a contract that with probability @xmath1 yields nothing and with probability @xmath1 yields 1000  usd .",
    "the no arbitrage ( na ) price interval for this contract is @xmath2 .",
    "but if the price of the contract is , for instance , 15  usd , then everyone would be willing to buy it , and the demand would not match the supply .",
    "thus , 15  usd is an unrealistic price because it yields a good deal , i.e. a trade that is attractive to most market participants .",
    "the technique of the ngd pricing is based on the assumption that good deals do not exist .",
    "a problem that arises immediately is how to define a good deal .",
    "there is no canonical answer , and several approaches have been proposed in the literature .",
    "cochrane and sa - requejo  @xcite defined a good deal as a trade with unusually high sharpe ratio , bernardo and ledoit  @xcite based their definition on another gain to loss ratio , while ern and hodges  @xcite proposed a generalization of both definitions ( see also the paper  @xcite by bjork and slinko , which extends the results of  @xcite ) .",
    "the technique of the ngd pricing can also be motivated as follows .",
    "when a trader sells a contract , he / she would charge for it a price , with which he / she will be able to superreplicate the contract . in theory the superreplication is typically understood almost surely , but in practice an agent looks for an offsetting position such that the risk of his / her overall portfolio would stay within the limits prescribed by his / her management ( the almost sure superreplication is virtually impossible in practice ) .",
    "these considerations lead to the ngd pricing with a good deal defined as a trade with negative risk . now",
    ", if risk is measured by v@r , this technique leads to the quantile hedging introduced by fllmer and leukert  @xcite .",
    "but instead of v@r , one can take a coherent risk measure .",
    "the corresponding pricing technique has already been considered in several papers .",
    "carr , geman , and madan  @xcite ( see also the review paper  @xcite ) studied this technique in a probabilistic framework ( although they do not use the term `` good deal '' ) , while jaschke and kchler  @xcite studied this technique in a topological space framework in the spirit of harrison and kreps  @xcite ( see also the paper  @xcite by staum , which extends the results of  @xcite ) . furthermore , larsen , pirvu , shreve , and ttnc  @xcite considered pricing based on convex risk measures instead of coherent ones ( convex risk measures were introduced by fllmer and schied  @xcite ) .",
    "roorda , schumacher , and engwerda  @xcite studied pricing in the multiperiod model using as a basis dynamic coherent risk measures instead of static ones .    *",
    "2 . goal of the paper .",
    "* this is the first of a series of papers dealing with applications of coherent risk measures to the basic problems of finance ( the other paper in the series is  @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea behind the series is :    * _ the whole finance can be built based on coherent risks . _ *    in this paper , we study applications to pricing in incomplete markets .",
    "our approach is similar to that of  @xcite , but  @xcite assumes an unrealistic world of a finite state space and a finite set of probabilistic scenarios defining a coherent risk measure ( most natural coherent risk measures are defined through an infinite set of probabilistic scenarios ; see subsection  [ bd ] ) .",
    "our model is general in the sense that we consider an arbitrary  @xmath3 and a general class of coherent risk measures ( satisfying only a sort of compactness condition ) .",
    "moreover , our approach applies to dynamic models , to models with an infinite number of assets , to models with transaction costs , and to models with convex portfolio constraints . within this general model ,",
    "we prove the fundamental theorem of asset pricing ( theorem  [ up4 ] ) and provide the form of the fair price interval of a contingent claim ( corollary  [ up6 ] ) .",
    "we confine ourselves to static risk measures .",
    "a problem that has attracted attention in several papers is as follows .",
    "consider a model with proportional transaction costs .",
    "is it true that the upper ( resp .",
    ", lower ) price of a contingent claim in this model tends to the upper ( resp .",
    ", lower ) price of this claim in the frictionless model as the coefficient of transaction costs tends to zero ?",
    "it was shown in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite that , for na prices , the answer to this question is negative already in the black - scholes model ( the contingent claim considered in these papers is a european call option ) .",
    "this result might be interpreted as follows : the na technique is useless in continuous - time models with transaction costs . in this paper ( theorem  [ pdt2 ] ) , we prove that , for ngd prices , the answer to the above question is positive .",
    "this is done within a framework of a general model ( the price follows an arbitrary process ) with an infinite number of assets and an arbitrary contingent claim ( satisfying only some integrability condition ) .",
    "the advantage of the ngd pricing is not only that this result is true , but also that its proof is very short .",
    "furthermore , we introduce a new variant of pricing based on coherent risk , which we call the _ raroc - based ngd _ pricing . the idea is to define a good deal as a trade with unusually high risk - adjusted return on capital ( raroc ) , where raroc is defined through coherent risk . on the mathematical side ,",
    "this technique is reduced to the standard ngd pricing ( with the original risk measure replaced by another one ) .",
    "although this series of papers deals primarily with applications of coherent risk measures to problems of finance , we also establish some results and give several definitions related to `` pure '' risk measures ( these are needed for applications ) .",
    "in particular , we introduce the notion of an _ extreme measure_.",
    "the results of this paper and  @xcite show that this notion is very convenient and important ; it appears in the outcomes of several pricing techniques proposed in  @xcite and in considerations of the equilibrium problem in  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we provide a solution of the _ capital allocation _ problem in terms of extreme measures ( theorem  [ ca1 ] ) .",
    "let us remark that this problem was considered in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "parallel with the measurement of outstanding risks , a very important problem is measuring the risk contribution of a subportfolio to a `` big '' portfolio .",
    "based on our solution of the capital allocation problem , we propose several equivalent definitions of the coherent _ risk contribution_.    another notion we introduce is the notion of a _",
    "generator_. it establishes a bridge between coherent risks and convex analysis , opening the way for geometry . in particular , we provide ( see figure  1 ) a geometric solution of the capital allocation problem ( thus there are two solutions : a probabilistic one is given in terms of extreme measures , while a geometric one is given in terms of generators ) .",
    "we also provide a geometric solution of the pricing and hedging problem ( proposition  [ hi4 ] ) for a model with a finite number of assets .",
    "furthermore , we provide in  @xcite geometric solutions of several optimization problems , optimality pricing problems , and the equilibrium problem .",
    "in fact , for most problems considered in this series of papers , we provide two sorts of results :    a geometric result applicable to a model with a finite number of assets is given in terms of generators ;    a probabilistic result applicable to a general model is typically given in terms of extreme measures .",

    "let us ask ourselves the following question : are `` financial '' random variables like the increment of a price of some asset indeed bounded ?",

    "the answer to the first question is positive ( clearly , everything is bounded by the number of the atoms in the universe ) .",
    "the answer to the second question is negative because most distributions used in theory ( like the lognormal one ) are unbounded .",
