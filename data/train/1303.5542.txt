    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) have been one of the outstanding problems of solar physics .",
    "the nature of driver and initiation mechanism for the sudden explosive release of the stored free magnetic energy are still unclear .",
    "it is proposed that cmes are that metastable magnetic configurations are followed by some finite perturbation or some additional energy build - up and make a eventual catastrophic transition to a lower energy state or to non - equilibrium state ( ref . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are already several mechanisms to cause the catastrophic transition have been proposed such as slow reduction of the overlying flux @xcite , photospheric converging and shear motions @xcite , flux emergence @xcite , etc .    as a candidate for the metastable configuration ,",
    "@xcite considered a long twisted flux tube , anchored at both ends in the photosphere with overlying magnetic arcade .",
    "they argue from a simple order - of - magnitude calculation that part of the flux tube will open up to infinity if there are 1 - 2 full winds for each field line in the flux tube even this configuration is stable according to linear mhd stability theory .",
    "@xcite carried out simulations in a spherical geometry of the evolution of coronal magnetic field as an a twisted magnetic flux rope emerges slowly into a preexisting coronal potential arcade field .",
    "she find that the flux tube becomes kinked and ruptures through the arcade field and cause a eruption when the twist in the emerged tube reaches a critical amount .",

    "are also usually observed @xcite .",
    "in addition , soft x - ray images of solar active regions frequently show s- or inverse - s ( sigmoidal ) morphology .",
    "@xcite found that active regions containing x - ray sigmoids are more likely to erupt and many eruption also associated with sigmoid structure . while the question of whether there exit highly twisted flux ropes with more than one wind between anchored ends susceptible to the kink instability as precursors for eruptive flux tube remains a topic of debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when these authors investigate the relation between the shape of x - ray sigmoid and eruption .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the partial expulsion of a three dimensional magnetic flux rope erupts when enough twist has emerged to induce a loss of equilibrium .",
    "after multiple reconnections at current sheets that form during the eruption , the rope breaks in two , so that only a part of it escapes .",
    "the `` degree of emergence '' of a pre - eruption flux rope , whether it possess bald - patch ( bp ) or whether it is high enough in the coronal to possess an x - line determines whether the rope is expelled totally or partially .",
    "their simulation result is well consistent with the partial eruption model described by @xcite .",
    "but should a twisted or kinked or magnetic flux tube need kink instability or twist over such threshold to eruption ?",
    "is it kink instability or kink - induced instability in a filament eruption @xcite ? for example , the kink instability may be occurring in conjunction with a breakout scenario @xcite .",
    "@xcite also argued that a force - free magnetic field in the unbounded space outside a sphere can not be in equilibrium if the amount of detached flux is too large compared to the amount of anchored flux .",
    "eruption of magnetic flux tube can also be caused by another instabilities such as torus instability @xcite and ballooning instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "so it is essential to investigate the whole eruptive process of a magnetic flux tube since emergence and evolution of structure in different wavelength especially the soft x - ray sigmoid for study how the metastable state is established and how to loss equilibrium and erupt for this magnetic flux tube .    on the other hand , @xcite pointed out that the accumulation of magnetic helicity in the corona plays a significant role in storing magnetic energy .",
    "they propose a conjecture that there is an upper bound on the total magnetic helicity that a force - free field can contain .",
    "the accumulation of magnetic helicity in excess of this upper bound would initiate a non - equilibrium situation , resulting in a cme expulsion as a natural product of coronal evolution .",

    "2 , all structures in the emerging flux tube showed a inverse s - shaped structure .",
    "these type of structures are associated with negative twist magnetic flux tube .",
    "the negative accumulated magnetic helicity also implies existence of negative twist in the flux tube .",
    "secondly , we can deduce this flux tube is a kinked flux tube . as the description in the sum .",
    "1 , this active region disobeyed joy s law and the tilt angle rotated clockwise . if we consider this flux tube as a simple flux tube described in @xcite , such type of flux tube should have a negative writhe ( right hand ) flux tube . in",
    "the framework of a kink instability model as simulated by @xcite , also noted in @xcite and @xcite , the sign of the writhe of kinked flux tubes would be the same as that of the twist within the tubes due to conservation of helicity . when a horizontal flux tube is emerging twisted right - handed ( left - handed ) of negative ( positive ) magnetic helicity , the writhe of the tube axis resulting from kink instability is also right - handed ( left - handed ) .",
    "this would leads to a clockwise ( counter - clockwise ) rotation of the apex portion of the rising tube as viewed from the top .",
    "such scenario well explains the evolution in sum . 1 .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the emerging flux tube tends to be caused by kink instability if the accumulated helicity and writhe have the same sign .",
    "hence , we conclude that the metastable structure before eruption is a kinked flux tube .",
    "what s the trigger mechanism for this kinked flux tube ?",
    "a kinked flux tube can erupts because of kink instability .",
    "there are already some evidences from observational results such as @xcite and @xcite or from simulation results such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another possible trigger mechanism is the torus instability .",
    "when the confining poloidal field decreases with distance fast enough , radially outward perturbations of the flux rope could trigger the torus instability @xcite before the helical kink instability set in , and the toroidal flux rope would no longer be confined .",
    "@xcite performed 3d simulations to investigate two distinct mechanisms that led to the eruption of the flux tube .",
    "one case ( case k ) is the emerging flux rope is kinked and a kink instability develops in it , leading to an eruption at last .",
    "the other one ( case t ) is the overlying field declines more rapidly with height , and the emerging flux rope is found to lose equilibrium and erupt via the torus instability .",
    "the corresponding normal relative magnetic helicity @xmath24 reaches approximately -0.16 for case k and approximately -0.18 for case t. however , in our observation result the normalized magnetic helicity is about -0.036 when the flux tube in ar 9729 erupted , which is one order smaller than the simulation results .",
    "@xcite explored the various magnetic configurations for failed and partial eruptions of filaments and cavities .",
    "they suggested that reconnection at different positions of the flux rope that threads into the filament creates different topologies with implications of full , partial , or failed filament eruptions .",
    "reconnection occurs within the prominence can cause partial filament to erupt and the rest part survive after eruption . @xcite also proposed a 3d tether - cutting model to explain the eruption process of a sigmoid structure .",
    "they conjecture that the magnetic explosion was unleashed by runaway tether - cutting via implosive / explosive reconnection in the middle of the sigmoid , as in the standard model .",
    "this internal reconnection apparently begins at the very start of the sigmoid eruption and grows in step with the explosion , caused the explosion to be ejective . in our observation , the bright point in the middle of sigmoid structure could be found clearly .",
    "two magnetic filed cancelation regions also existed before eruption and disappeared after eruption reflect the existence of reconnection there .",
    "therefore we propose that field lines rooted to the photosphere near the inversion line where for the formation of a magnetic tangential discontinuity are locally reconnection and cause an instability .",
    "field lines above the surface are detached from the photosphere to form this cme and partially open the field which make the filament loses equilibrium to rise quickly and then be drawn back by the tension force of magnetic field after eruption to form a new filament in our observation .",
    "the eruption happened when the accumulated magnetic approach near the maximum .",
    "it probably related to the possible existence of upper bounds of total relative magnetic helicity for force - free magnetic field in unbounded space , as conjectured in @xcite on the study of axis - symmetric force - free field solutions .",
    "the absolute normalized helicity is @xmath25 , which is also close to the theoretical prediction value 0.035 of @xcite when a multipolar force - free magnetic field structure could sustain before eruption .",
