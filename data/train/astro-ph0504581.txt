    "the tight correlation between luminosity and rotation speed is one of the fundamental characteristics of the disk galaxy population ( @xcite , hereafter tf ) . with stellar population modeling and hi gas measurements ,",
    "this correlation can be expressed in terms of stellar mass or total baryonic mass , in place of luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the form and tightness of the tf relation are critical tests for theoretical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in classic models of disk galaxy formation by dissipative gravitational collapse ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter mmw ) , the quantities that determine the disk rotation curve are the concentration parameter of the dark matter halo , the ratio of the disk baryonic mass to the total mass of the halo , and the disk scale length , which is determined by its angular momentum .",
    "these theoretical models suggest that disk size could be an important additional parameter in disk galaxy correlations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a strong correlation between disk size and tf residual is also expected if disks are `` maximal '' and therefore make a dominant contribution to the observed rotation speed ( @xcite ) .    in this paper , we investigate the correlations among rotation speed , stellar mass , and scale length in a sample of disk galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have obtained long - slit optical spectra of these galaxies and used them to extract h@xmath4 rotation curves .",
    "we use the @xmath24-@xmath25 color of each galaxy to estimate its stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath26 , and therefore its stellar mass , following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "we apply bulge - disk decomposition to the sdss @xmath5-band images to select a sample of disk - dominated galaxies ( disk / total @xmath27 0.9 ) and to measure the disk exponential scale length .",
    "we estimate circular velocities at 2.2 disk scale lengths , where the rotation curve of a self - gravitating exponential disk reaches its maximum ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the estimated stellar masses to separate the disk and halo contributions to the total mass within this radius , and we investigate the halo - to - disk ratio as a function of stellar mass and disk scale length .",
    "we discuss our results in the context of mmw - style disk galaxy models .",
    "the sdss galaxy redshift survey has an unprecedented combination of large area , depth , and photometric quality , thanks to the combination of a large format camera @xcite , high throughput multi - object spectrographs , careful calibration procedures @xcite , and an efficient series of data reduction and targeting pipelines @xcite .",
    "we have selected a sample of @xmath28 200 galaxies from the main galaxy sample ( @xcite ) of the sdss redshift survey for follow - up dynamical study with long - slit h@xmath4 spectroscopy .",
    "our full sample covers a representative selection of galaxies in the absolute magnitude range @xmath29 , with no morphological pre - selection other than an @xmath5-band isophotal axis ratio cut of @xmath30 @xmath31 0.6 , needed to allow accurate inclination corrections to observed rotation velocities .",
    "we impose a minimum redshift , @xmath32 @xmath27 5000 @xmath33 , so that peculiar velocities do not cause large uncertainties in distance ( and thus luminosity and size ) .",
    "we adopt a luminosity - dependent maximum redshift of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , so that galaxies are spatially resolved and the distribution of absolute magnitudes is roughly flat over the range @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "analysis of the tully - fisher relation and its residuals for this broadly representative galaxy sample , including detailed discussion of the sample definition , spectroscopic observations and data reduction procedures , and rotation curve fits , will be presented by pizagno et al .",
    "( in preparation , hereafter p05 ) . here",
    "we summarize the relevant aspects of these procedures and describe the selection of the disk - dominated galaxy sample that is analyzed in this paper .    in a series of observing runs between june 2001 and april 2004",
    ", we obtained long - slit spectra covering the h@xmath4 wavelength region for a total of 234 galaxies in the velocity and absolute magnitude ranges described above , using the twin spectrograph on the calar alto 3.5-m telescope ( 189 galaxies ) and the ccds spectrograph on the mdm 2.4-m telescope ( 45 galaxies ) .",
    "typical exposure times were 30 minutes at calar alto and 60 minutes at mdm , with instrumental setups yielding fwhm resolution @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "we obtained usable h@xmath4 rotation curves for 170 galaxies , @xmath44 of the input sample , with the remainder showing insufficient extended h@xmath4 emission or ( in a few cases ) excessively irregular velocity profiles .",
    "we applied the bulge - disk decomposition program galfit ( @xcite ) to the @xmath5-band images of these 170 galaxies , taken from the sdss corrected frames .",
    "specifically , we fit each galaxy with a combination of an inclined exponential disk and a bulge with a surface brightness profile @xmath45 $ ] ( @xcite ) , with the index @xmath46 constrained to the range 0.5 @xmath27 @xmath46 @xmath27 5.0 .    for this paper ,",
    "we select those galaxies with disk - to - total luminosity ratio @xmath47 0.9 .",
    "these systems may not be perfectly described by smooth exponential disks , but the addition of a bulge containing more than 10% of the light does not allow a better fit .",
    "we rejected five galaxies for which the discrepancy between the galfit exponential disk position angle and the sdss isophotal position angle , used for the long - slit observations , would lead to a velocity difference of more than 10% .",
    "we confirmed the disk - dominated nature of the remaining 81 galaxies by visual inspection .",
    "we note that @xmath48 is a stronger morphological cut than that in most tf samples , which also include some galaxies with significant bulges .",
    "we adopt the more stringent cut mainly because it allows us to define scale length and velocity measures , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , that are insensitive to ambiguities of bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "also , while the bulge formation mechanisms in late - type galaxies are uncertain , our sample gives theoretical modelers a clear target to make predictions for : nearly bulgeless galaxies , with an absolute magnitude distribution that is approximately flat in the range @xmath49 .",
    "we compare results from this sample to those of our full , morphologically representative sample in p05 .",
    "we compute galaxy luminosities using sdss petrosian fluxes and colors using sdss model colors , both k - corrected to redshift @xmath50 using blanton et al.s ( @xcite ) kcorrect_v3.1b .",
    "we compute distances using the sdss heliocentric redshifts corrected to the rest frame of the local group barycenter ( @xcite ) , assuming a cosmological model with @xmath51=0.3 , @xmath52=0.7 , and hubble constant @xmath53 .",
    "we incorporate a distance uncertainty corresponding to @xmath54 when calculating disk scale length and luminosity uncertainties , to account for the typical amplitude of small scale peculiar velocities ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of our sample galaxies in the color - magnitude plane .",
    "crosses show galaxies that did not have enough h@xmath4 emission for extended rotation curves .",
    "although most of these failed galaxies are either red or low luminosity , the galaxies with successful rotation curve measurements cover all populated areas of the color - magnitude plane , so there are no major categories of galaxies in this absolute magnitude range that are missing from our sample .",
    "filled circles show the disk - dominated subset analyzed in this paper . these again span all populated regions of the color - magnitude plane , though the distribution is somewhat bluer than that of the full sample , and the fraction of disk - dominated systems is higher at low luminosity .",
    "the surface brightness distribution ( not shown ) is similar to that of the full sample , though the low and intermediate luminosity galaxies that are eliminated by the @xmath55 cut tend to be above the median surface brightness .",
    "the galfit total magnitudes in @xmath5-band are 0.12 magnitudes brighter than sdss petrosian magnitudes on average , with a standard deviation of 0.10 magnitudes , in reasonable agreement with expectations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we use the petrosian magnitudes for our analysis so that our results refer to quantities easily accessible from the sdss database .",
    "the spectroscopic data were dark subtracted , flat - fielded , and linearized using standard iraf procedures , as outlined by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we extract 2-d spectra along the spatial direction and measure the h@xmath4 emission line centroid at each location along the slit .",
    "the h@xmath4 emission line centroid uncertainty is between 2 and 12 @xmath56 depending on the signal - to - noise ratio of the emission line .",
    "we define the rotation curve as the spatial variation of the emission line centroids along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "we fit galaxy rotation curves with an arc - tangent function , which has a minimal number of parameters while still describing the global shape of typical rotation curves adequately ( @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , we use a levenberg - marquardt @xmath57 minimization routine ( @xcite ) to fit the data with the functional form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the central velocity , @xmath60 is the asymptotic circular velocity , @xmath25 is the position along the slit , @xmath61 is the center of the rotation curve ( where @xmath62 ) , and @xmath63 is the turnover radius at which the rotation curve begins to flatten . when performing the fit , we add 10 @xmath33 in quadrature to the observational error on each h@xmath4 data point , to account for non - circular motions and to ensure that parameters are determined by the overall shape of the rotation curve rather than the high signal - to - noise data points in the inner parts of the rotation curve with small uncertainties .",
    "we adopt the circular velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths as our measure of rotation speed .",
    "the rotation curve of an isolated exponential disk peaks at this radius @xcite , and @xcite shows that this velocity measure produces the tightest tf relation .",
    "we infer the observed rotation velocity ( @xmath64 ) by evaluating equation ( 1 ) at @xmath65 , where @xmath1 is the @xmath5-band disk scale length determined by galfit . the uncertainty in @xmath64 is determined using the covariance of the parameter errors returned by the levenberg - marquardt routine .",
    "we correct @xmath64 for inclination by using the galfit - determined disk axis ratio and the equation @xmath66 where 0.19 is the assumed intrinsic axis ratio for an edge - on disk and @xmath30 is the measured @xmath5-band axis ratio .",
    "observational estimates of the intrinsic axis ratio vary from 0.10 to 0.20 depending on galaxy type @xcite .",
    "we choose 0.19 , typical for spiral galaxies , and note that the range @xmath67 corresponds to a small variation ( typically @xmath281@xmath56 ) in @xmath2 . as discussed in detail by p05 , roughly @xmath68 of our galaxies have rotation curves that are still rising at the outermost h@xmath4 point .",
    "we have included these galaxies in our sample , but we have checked that excluding them makes minimal difference to our results .",
    "table  1 lists the sdss identifier , distance , @xmath5-band luminosity , @xmath7 color , stellar mass , galfit disk fraction , disk exponential scale length , and rotation velocity @xmath2 for the 81 galaxies that comprise our disk - dominated sample .",
    "the luminosities and colors are corrected for internal extinction , and stellar masses are computed from these extinction - corrected quantities , as described in the next section .",
    "figure 2a show the @xmath5-band tf relation for our sample of 81 disk - dominated galaxies . following standard practice , we correct luminosities , and colors , for internal extinction based on the disk axis ratio and luminosity , using the prescription of @xcite interpolated to the central wavelength of the sdss @xmath5-band .",
    "we convert luminosities to solar units using @xmath69 = @xmath70 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the three representative error crosses in the lower right show the 90th - percentile , 50th - percentile , and 10th - percentile values of the observational uncertainties .",
    "we add @xmath68 of the inclination correction in quadrature to the luminosity uncertainty to represent the uncertainty in the inclination correction itself .",
    "luminosity uncertainties are dominated by this inclination correction uncertainty and by the @xmath71 peculiar velocity uncertainty .",
    "the solid line shows our `` forward '' fit to the observed tf relation .",
    "specifically , we fit a relation @xmath72 with @xmath73 , @xmath74 , assuming a gaussian intrinsic scatter of dispersion @xmath75 in @xmath76 at fixed @xmath77 , in addition to observational uncertainties .",
    "we determine maximum likelihood values of @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath75 by maximizing @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the observational uncertainties for data point @xmath5 ( see p05 for discussion ) .",
    "we determine the @xmath83 errors on @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath75 by repeating this procedure for 100 bootstrap subsamples of the full data set and taking the dispersion as the uncertainty .",
    "we choose the reference value @xmath84 so that there is essentially no covariance between the errors in the slope @xmath78 and intercept @xmath79 .    for the forward tf relation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath85 the intrinsic scatter is @xmath75=0.13 dex = 0.33 magnitudes , comparable to that of other tf studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the dotted line shows the inverse tf fit , in which we assume that there is gaussian intrinsic scatter of @xmath86 at fixed @xmath87 instead of the reverse . forward and",
    "inverse fits correspond to different hypotheses about the intrinsic distribution of the correlated quantities , and they yield different slopes except in the limit of zero intrinsic scatter . our inclusion of the intrinsic scatter as a fit parameter means that points with small _ observational _ errors do not get inappropriately large weights in determining the slope and normalization , a difference from many previous analyses .",
    "however , for this sample the intrinsic scatter is small enough that the derived slope is not highly sensitive to the fitting procedure ( for example , the inverse fit is @xmath88 ) .",
    "our slope is shallower than that found by some previous studies , e.g. , @xcite , who finds a slope of @xmath89 in @xmath90-band , or @xcite , who find a slope of @xmath91 in @xmath92-band .",
    "however , it agrees well with the @xmath25-band slope of @xmath93 found by @xcite , whose sample criteria and analysis procedures are most similar to ours .",
    "we discuss possible contributions to slope differences in more detail below .",
    "our estimates of the slopes , intercepts , and intrinsic scatter of these and all other bivariate relations fit in this paper are listed in table 2 .",
    "residuals from these relations show no discernible correlation with axis ratio , which indicates that our inclination corrections are accurate in the mean , even if they are not perfect on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis .",
    "the appendix presents a monte carlo test for malmquist - type biases in our sample selection and analysis and shows that they are small compared to our quoted statstical errors , with an effect @xmath94 on the forward tf slope .",
    "the point types in figure 2a encode galaxy color , relative to the expectation for the galaxy s @xmath5-band luminosity .",
    "we fit a linear mean relation to the sample s ( @xmath24-@xmath25 ) vs. @xmath95 relation and divide the sample into three nearly equal parts based on the residual from this relation .",
    "squares represent galaxies redder than the mean by 0.02 mag or more , circles represent galaxies bluer by 0.05 mag or more , and triangles show the remaining galaxies .",
    "there is a slight tendency for red galaxies to lie below the mean tf relation , as one might expect given the higher mass - to - light ratios or red stellar populations , but the trend is weak relative to the scatter .    in figure 2b , we have converted galaxy @xmath5-band luminosities to stellar masses , using the prescription of @xcite to infer each galaxy s stellar mass - to - light ratio from its ( @xmath24-@xmath25 ) color .",
    "we use color in preference to the spectroscopic methods of @xcite because the sdss fibers cover only the central regions of these relatively nearby galaxies and may not sample a representative stellar population .",
    "@xcite adopt a `` diet salpeter '' initial mass function ( imf ) chosen so that stellar disks have the maximum mass allowed by rotation curve constraints . at each @xmath24-@xmath25 color",
    ", we multiply their stellar mass - to - light ratios by 0.71 to correspond to a kroupa imf , which better represents direct observational estimates of the imf ( see @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "specifically , we calculate stellar masses using the relations    @xmath96    where the two coefficients are from table 7 of @xcite .",
    "we use inclination corrected luminosities and colors , again based on the @xcite prescriptions , but the inclination effects are small ( typically less than 10% ) because galaxies move along a locus of roughly constant @xmath0 as their luminosities and colors are corrected for extinction .",
    "we add an error contribution to @xmath0 that is one - third of the applied inclination correction .",
    "points in figure 2b are again coded by galaxy @xmath24-@xmath25 color residual , now computed as a function of stellar mass .",
    "the conversion to stellar mass has removed the slight trend of tf residual with color residual , as one might expect if stellar mass is the more fundamental quantity .",
    "solid and dotted lines show our best - fit forward and inverse relations , which are listed in table 1 .",
    "the forward relation is @xmath97 the best - fit intrinsic scatter is 0.16 dex , slightly higher than 0.13 dex found for the @xmath10 relation .",
    "some of this increase could reflect galaxy - to - galaxy variations in stellar populations or extinction properties , which would change the true @xmath98 ratios at fixed @xmath7 color ; we have assumed a deterministic relation between @xmath7 and @xmath98 and have not included any scatter about this relation in our observational error budget .",
    "the bd01 models have 0.1 dex scatter in stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath0/@xmath6 ) at fixed color .",
    "the short - dashed line shows the best - fit stellar - mass tf relation found by @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter bd01 ) , using @xcite s ( @xcite ) data for the ursa major cluster .",
    "we have multiplied the normalization of their relation ( the @xmath99-band fit with mass - dependent inclination correction from their table 2 ) by 0.71 to adjust to the kroupa imf assumed here .",
    "distances are calibrated to @xmath100 in both cases , though there could be some uncertainty in the relative distance normalization from the peculiar velocity of ursa major .",
    "the two relations agree at @xmath101 , but the bd01 relation is substantially steeper than ours , with a slope of @xmath102 vs. @xmath103 . at @xmath104",
    "the bd01 relation traces the lower envelope of our data points and lies @xmath105 dex below our best - fit relations .",
    "differences in the samples and analysis methods include : our use of the updated @xcite stellar population models in place of the bd01 models , our use of a disk / total @xmath3 cut vs.  bd01 s more generic `` late type galaxy '' selection , our use of @xmath2 as a velocity measure in place of @xcite s ( @xcite ) @xmath106 measure used by bd01 , and our `` field '' ( or , more accurately , random ) environment selection vs.   their cluster sample ,    since @xcite finds a steep @xmath90-band tf relation for the ursa major galaxies , bd01 s steep slope ( relative to ours ) appears to be intrinsic to the sample , not a consequence of any differences in stellar population modeling .",
    "our disk / total cut also seems unlikely to be the main source of difference , since the low-@xmath2 galaxies that _ are _ in our sample lie significantly above any of the bd01 data points , and the relatively small number of low-@xmath2 galaxies excluded by our cut lie on or above the best - fit relation . to investigate the importance of velocity definition differences , we used the data of @xcite , who lists @xmath2 and the maximum velocity @xmath107 derived from a 5-parameter fit to optical rotation curves .",
    "the typical ratio of @xmath107 to @xmath2 is higher for less massive galaxies , and since @xmath106 is likely to track @xmath107 more closely than @xmath2 , the trend goes in the right direction to explain the discrepancy .",
    "however , if we scale up our @xmath2 values using a mean correction derived from the @xcite data , then our @xmath11 slope changes to 3.47 , still much shallower than bd01 , and the gap between the relations is still @xmath108 dex in @xmath0 at @xmath109 .",
    "thus , it appears that velocity definition differences can account for roughly half of the difference between our results and bd01 s .",
    "we reach a similar conclusion by comparing verheijen s ( 2001 ) @xmath25-band tf data points to our own ( see p05 ) .",
    "the most plausible source we can identify for the remaining gap is a systematic difference in properties of field and cluster spirals at low luminosity .",
    "reconciling the two measurements requires the cluster galaxies to rotate faster by @xmath110 dex at fixed @xmath0 . fully addressing this difference requires a large sample with a range of environments and both hi and optical data , so that one can mimic selection and analysis procedures used by different authors .",
    "our stellar mass tf relation is also shallower than the _ baryonic _ tf relation derived by @xcite , @xmath111 ( for @xmath53 ) . here",
    "@xmath112 is the sum of the stellar mass and the gas mass inferred from hi measurements .",
    "we can not directly estimate @xmath112 for our galaxies because we do not have hi data , but @xcite reports a statistical correlation ( with substantial scatter ) between gas - to - stellar mass fraction and sdss @xmath113 color , @xmath114 .",
    "if we apply this correction to our sample on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis , we obtain @xmath115 , shallower than equation  ( [ eqn : mv ] ) because low mass galaxies have higher gas content .",
    "the average mass increase is @xmath116 dex at @xmath104 and @xmath117 dex at @xmath101 .",
    "our slope is substantially shallower than that found by @xcite , who combine several data sets obtained in different bands .. ] the @xcite sample covers a much wider mass range than ours , extending to circular velocities @xmath118 . the difference between optical linewidth @xmath119 and the hi linewidth @xmath120 used by @xcite could become more important at these low velocities , partly explaining the difference in slope , but we do not see an easy way to fully reconcile the results .",
    "figure 3 plots the galfit disk scale length @xmath1 against stellar mass .",
    "the dotted line shows the best - fit mean relation @xmath121 however , scatter about this mean relation is very broad .",
    "points are coded by the residual from this best - fit relation , with squares , triangles , and circles representing the largest , intermediate , and smallest @xmath68 of the galaxies at a given luminosity .",
    "theoretical expectations for the distribution of disk galaxies in the space of stellar mass , scale length , and circular velocity are clearly described by , e.g. , @xcite , mmw , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use a modeling approach similar to that of mmw to place our observational results in theoretical context . the central solid line in figure 3",
    "shows the predicted @xmath122 relation for galaxies with a ratio @xmath22=0.05 of stellar mass to total halo mass formed in an nfw halo ( @xcite ) with concentration parameter @xmath123=10 and spin parameter @xmath19=0.06 .",
    "we compute this relation using equation ( 28 ) of mmw , which includes the effects of disk self - gravity and adiabatic contraction of the inner regions of the halo .",
    "we set the specific angular momentum of the disk equal to that of the halo ( @xmath124 in mmw s notation ) , so our quantity @xmath19 is equivalent to their @xmath125 . while the predicted relation is steeper than our best fit , it roughly describes the central trend of our data points .",
    "upper and lower solid lines show the predictions for @xmath19=0.08 and 0.04 , respectively .",
    "the envelope of these lines encloses roughly the central 80% of the data points .",
    "the distribution of halo spin parameter in n - body simulations is approximately log - normal with a mean @xmath126 and dispersion @xmath127 @xcite . for @xmath22=0.05 , reproducing the @xmath1-@xmath128 relation requires @xmath19 values in the upper half of this distribution , so disks would either have to form in the higher spin halos or have a higher specific angular momentum than the dark matter . since systems with low angular momentum may be more likely to form a substantial bulge , and thus be omitted from our disk - dominated sample , this preferential sampling of the high end of the @xmath19-distribution is not implausible .",
    "however , the three solid lines in figure 3 can also be produced ( almost exactly ) with a disk - to - halo mass fraction @xmath22=0.025 and @xmath19 of 0.03 , 0.045 , 0.06 ; the lower @xmath22 shifts the predicted relations to lower @xmath128 , and lower @xmath19 values are required to compensate .",
    "conversely , for @xmath22=0.10 , the @xmath19 values that yield similar @xmath122 curves are 0.055 , 0.08 , 0.11 .",
    "figure 4 again shows the stellar - mass tf relation , @xmath128 vs. @xmath2 , but points are now coded by their residual from the best - fit @xmath122 relation , with squares , triangles , and circles representing the largest , intermediate , and smallest galaxies , respectively , just as in figure 3 .",
    "there is no evident separation among these three sets of points , i.e. , no tendency of large or small galaxies to lie above or below the mean @xmath129 relation .",
    "a plot of @xmath129 residual against @xmath122 residual ( shown as inset ) is simply a scatter plot .",
    "as noted by @xcite and @xcite , the lack of correlation between tf residual and disk scale length argues against the `` maximal disk '' hypothesis , in which the stellar disk provides a large fraction of the rotational support at @xmath12 , since in this case @xmath130 .",
    "we concur with both their observational result ( indeed , our residual correlation appears even weaker ) and with their conclusion .    filled squares in figure 4 show model predictions for disks with mass fraction @xmath17 and the spin parameter @xmath131 that yields the central solid line of figure 3 , with total halo masses of @xmath132 , 1.89@xmath133 , and 1.39@xmath134 @xmath135 .",
    "( following mmw , we define the halo mass within a virial radius whose mean interior density is 200 times the critical density . )",
    "we again assume an initial nfw halo concentration @xmath136 and compute @xmath1 using mmw s equation ( 28 ) , but we compute the response of the halo to the disk using the improved adiabatic contraction approximation of @xcite , with code kindly provided by oleg gnedin . with these parameters ,",
    "the model reproduces the slope and normalization of our measured @xmath129 relation as well as the @xmath1-@xmath128 relation .",
    "horizontal lines attached to these points show the effect of changing the spin parameter to @xmath137 and @xmath138 , corresponding to the lower and upper lines in figure 3 .",
    "larger disks have weaker self - gravity and therefore lower @xmath2 , while compact disks make a substantial contribution to @xmath2 and therefore spin faster .",
    "however , the predicted difference between large and small disks is small enough that it could plausibly be swamped by the scatter seen in figure 4 .    filled triangles in figure 4 show models with @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which also reproduce the central line of figure 3 , for the same three halo masses ( and @xmath136 ) .",
    "lowering @xmath22 reduces both @xmath128 and the disk contribution to @xmath2 , but the shift is not exactly parallel to the @xmath129 relation , so the model predictions for @xmath139 lie below the central trend of the data , by @xmath141 dex .",
    "however , a choice of imf with fewer low mass stars would reduce @xmath142 ratios at fixed color and could bring down the data points to agree with the @xmath139 predictions .",
    "because of the lower disk mass fraction , variations of @xmath19 that reproduce the spread in the @xmath122 relation ( @xmath143 ) produce only small shifts in @xmath2 at fixed @xmath128 .",
    "filled circles show models with @xmath144 and @xmath138 .",
    "the model predictions now lie above the central trend of the data .",
    "adopting a more bottom - heavy imf could raise the data points and remove this discrepancy , but the @xmath144 model predicts a substantial change of @xmath2 over the range @xmath145 that reproduces the spread in the @xmath1-@xmath128 relation .",
    "for @xmath144 , the compact galaxies ( open circles ) should lie noticeably to the right of the large galaxies ( open squares ) in figure 4 , and they do not .",
    "in other words , @xmath144 disks in adiabatically contracted , @xmath136 , nfw halos are too close to maximal to be consistent with the absence of a size - tf residual correlation .",
    "it is difficult to put this discrepancy in fully quantitative terms because a viable model would have to specify what parameters _ other _ than @xmath19 are varying to produce the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath129 relation .",
    "we will investigate this question in future work .",
    "figure 5a repackages the information in figures 3 and 4 by plotting the rotation velocity predicted for the stellar disk , @xmath146^{1/2}~,\\ ] ] against the observed rotation velocity @xmath2 .",

    "since velocities add in quadrature , @xmath150 , the normalization of equation ( 9 ) implies a typical ratio of @xmath151 @xmath28 1.2 of the halo and stellar disk circular velocities at @xmath12 .",

    "if we apply @xcite s ( @xcite ) color - based estimate of gas - to - stellar mass ratios to compute the total disk contribution @xmath153 instead of @xmath154 , then the normalization of equation  ( [ eqn : vstar ] ) rises slightly , to 0.71 , and the slope changes to 1.07 , a nearly constant ratio of disk mass to dark halo mass within @xmath16 .    in figure 5b , we use each galaxy s actual scale length , instead of the mean scale length from the @xmath122 relation , when computing @xmath152 .",

    "the increase of scatter between figures 5a and 5b , another manifestation of the uncorrelated tf and disk size residuals , implies that this gap is not simply a consequence of underestimating @xmath98 ratios ; dark halos must provide an important contribution to rotational support at @xmath12 .",

    "the median ratio is higher ( @xmath28 4.4 ) in agreement with previous results ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the scatter is larger .",
    "this increased mass ratio corresponds to the steeper than unit slope of the @xmath152-@xmath2 relation in figure 5 ; the increase is reduced but not eliminated if we use the @xcite gas correction to estimate baryonic masses instead of stellar masses .",

    "while the scatter in disk sizes explains some of the scatter in @xmath160 , figure 6b shows that much of the scatter must arise from another source .",
    "here we plot @xmath160 against @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the mean disk scale length at the galaxy s stellar mass based on the best - fit @xmath1-@xmath128 relation ( dotted line of figure 3 ) .",
