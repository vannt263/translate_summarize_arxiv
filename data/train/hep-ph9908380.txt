    "the modern paradigm for cosmological inflation is generically termed ` chaotic ' , referring primarily to its choice of initial conditions @xcite . in its simplest form , a single scalar field  the inflaton @xmath2",
    " evolves slowly along its potential @xmath3 towards its minimum at the origin .",
    "the essential challenge is to embed consistently this potential in an underlying particle physics model , within a natural range of variation of the parameters involved and respecting the ` slow - roll conditions ' @xcite .",
    "these are upper limits on the normalized slope and curvature of the potential : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the normalised planck mass and the potential determines the hubble parameter during inflation as , @xmath6 .",
    "inflation ends ( i.e. @xmath7 , the acceleration of the cosmological scale factor , changes sign from negative to positive ) when @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 become of @xmath10 .",
    "it is easy to see that this challenge is _ not _ met by simple models of the potential .",
    "consider the quadratic form @xcite @xmath11 the adiabatic scalar density perturbation generated through quantum fluctuations of the inflaton is @xcite @xmath12 where the subscript @xmath13 denotes the epoch at which a fluctuation of wavenumber @xmath14 crosses the hubble radius @xmath15 during inflation , i.e. when @xmath16 .",
    "( we normalise @xmath17 at the present epoch , when the hubble expansion rate is @xmath18  kms@xmath19mpc@xmath19 , with @xmath20 . )",
    "the cobe observations @xcite of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background on large angular - scales require @xcite @xmath21 on the scale of the observable universe ( @xmath22  mpc ) .",
    "in addition , the cobe data fix the spectral index , @xmath23 , on this scale : @xmath24 the slow - roll condition ( [ slowroll ] ) together with the cobe normalisation ( [ cobe ] ) then implies @xmath25 at the epoch when the fluctuations observed by cobe were generated .",
    "similarly if we consider the quartic potential @xmath26 @xcite , eqs.([slowroll ] ) and ( [ cobe ] ) imply @xmath27    thus we see that the slow - roll condition ( especially on @xmath28 ) generically requires @xmath29 which is difficult to motivate in a particle physics model . in models incorporating gravity ,",
    "non - renormalisable corrections of the form @xmath30 are unsuppressed at large @xmath31 for any @xmath32 and do not have the monomial form usually assumed in chaotic inflationary models .",
    "furthermore the cobe measurement of the scalar perturbation amplitude implies extreme fine tuning because the only natural scale for @xmath33 is the planck scale @xmath34 , in conflict with eq.([vev ] ) .",
    "alternatively an extremely small value is required for the self - coupling as in eq.([lambda ] ) , which also represents unnatural fine tuning .",
    "given the difficulty of constructing realistic particle physics models which can drive inflation for large @xmath31 , it is natural to ask whether there are viable models which work for small @xmath31 , i.e. ` new inflation ' @xcite in which the potential has a maximum at the origin and the inflaton evolves away from it .",
    "in this case low powers of @xmath35 will dominate the potential during the era of observable inflation .",
    "starting from @xmath36 and assuming that the symmetry properties of the model forbid a linear term , the quadratic term will dominate , giving a potential of the form @xmath37 where the constant vacuum energy @xmath38 is now the leading term in the potential . from eq.([slowroll ] ) we have now the constraint @xmath39 and this is again much smaller than the natural value for the mass . to solve this problem",
    "we are driven to consider theories in which a symmetry prevents @xmath33 from being large . the only known symmetry capable of achieving this is supersymmetry which can guarantee that @xmath33 vanishes in the limit that supersymmetry is unbroken .",
    "however the non - vanishing potential of eq.([newinflation ] ) driving inflation _ breaks _ ( global ) supersymmetry and so , even in supersymmetric models , @xmath33 will be non - zero in general . in the extreme case that the inflaton has vanishing non - gravitational couplings , gravitational effects",
    "will typically induce a mass of order @xmath40 for any scalar field @xcite , in particular the inflaton @xcite .",
    "nevertheless this is a big improvement over the non - supersymmetric case , for the fine tuning problem now simply becomes one of requiring @xmath41 with @xmath42 to obtain successful inflation .    in this letter",
    "we summarise the results of a general analysis of supergravity inflationary models in which a quadratic term dominates the evolution of the potential for small values of the inflaton .",
    "as discussed in section  [ eta ] , one can find models for which @xmath43 is naturally small , consistent with the slow - roll requirements .",
    "however , even in these models it is difficult to make the mass negligibly small so that the quadratic term is likely to be dominant at small inflaton field values .",
    "for this reason we consider models of inflation driven by a quadratic term to be the most _ natural _ supersymmetric inflationary models .",
    "however such models still leave unanswered several important questions concerning the initial conditions .",
    "the most important question is why the universe should initially be homogeneous enough for slow - roll inflation to begin @xcite . in chaotic models",
    "@xcite , inflation begins when the scale of the potential energy is of order the planck scale and the horizon ( the scale over which the universe must be homogeneous for inflation to start ) is also of order the planck scale .",
    "by contrast in the models discussed here , inflation starts much later when the horizon contains many such planck scale horizons and , in this case , it is difficult to understand how the necessary level of homogeneity can be realised .",
    "however this argument is not really a criticism of the possibility that there be a late stage of inflation but rather a statement that this can not be all there is .",
    "thus we are implicitly assuming that there was some other process which ensured the necessary homogeneity at the begining of quadratic inflation , as in the original chaotic inflation scenario @xcite or in the context of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "such models lead to a situation in which a homogeneous universe emerges at the planck era and potential energy is released reheating the universe and possibly setting the conditions for further periods of inflation to occur .",
    "this leads to the second initial condition question , namely why should such a universe subsequently undergo inflation at a lower energy scale ? in the case of interest here",
    "this amounts to asking why the inflaton field has initially such a small value that slow - roll inflation from the neighbourhood of the origin is possible ?",
    "remarkably , within the context of supersymmetric inflationary models there is a straightforward answer because quite generally supersymmetry is broken by finite temperature effects i.e. the inflaton potential at high temperatures is not likely to be the same as that at zero temperature @xmath44 as we discuss later , thermal effects may readily drive the inflaton to the origin where the symmetry is enhanced , thus offering an elegant solution to this initial condition problem .",
    "of course this requires that the system be initially in thermal equilibrium and this is not normally the case in slow - roll inflationary models , particularly since the inflaton should be very weakly coupled in order not to spoil the required flatness of its potential .",
    "however quadratic inflation is special in as much as the value of the potential during inflation is not strongly constrained by the need to generate the correct magnitude of density fluctuations . for the case that the potential energy driving inflation is low , we will show that the processes leading to thermal equilibrium have time to work before the inflationary era starts .",
    "a further possible advantage of lowering the inflationary scale is that it may be then readily identified with a scale already present in particle physics .",
    "for example a low @xmath45 may be identified with the susy breaking scale in the hidden sector , @xmath46 . as is well known @xcite this yields a gravitino mass , @xmath47 of order the electroweak scale , as is needed to avoid the hierarchy problem of grand unified theories .",
    "recently an even more radical solution to the hierarchy problem has been suggested , namely that the only fundamental scale is the electroweak breaking scale itself and that the ( four dimensional ) planck scale is a derived quantity @xcite . as we shall see , slow - roll quadratic inflation is possible even at the electroweak scale . in the next section",
    "we discuss the expectation for the inflaton potential following from supergravity .",
    "readers primarily interested in the cosmological implications may wish to skip this and go straight to section  [ para ] .",
    "in @xmath48 supersymmetric theories with a single susy generator , complex scalar fields are the lowest components , @xmath49 , of chiral superfields , @xmath50 , which contain chiral fermions , @xmath51 , as their other components . in what follows we will take @xmath50 to be left - handed chiral superfields so that @xmath51 are left - handed massless fermions .",
    "masses for fields will be generated by spontaneous symmetry breakdown so that the only fundamental mass scale is the normalised planck scale .",
    "this is aesthetically attractive and is also what follows if the underlying theory generating the effective low - energy supergravity theory emerges from the superstring .",
    "the @xmath48 supergravity theory describing the interaction of the chiral superfields is specified by the khler potential @xcite , @xmath52 here @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( the superpotential ) are two functions which need to be specified ; they must be chosen to be invariant under the symmetries of the theory .",
    "the dimension of @xmath53 is 2 and that of @xmath54 is 3 , so terms bilinear ( trilinear ) in the superfields appear without any mass factors in @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the scalar potential following from eq.([g ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath55 + { \\rm d - terms } , \\label{v}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 at any point in the space of scalar fields @xmath57 we can make a combination of a khler transformation and a holomorphic field redefinition such that @xmath58 at that point and the khler potential takes the form @xmath59 .",
    "in this form , the scalar kinetic terms are canonical at @xmath58 and from eq.([v ] ) , neglecting d - terms and simplifying to the case of a single scalar field , the scalar potential writes @xmath60      = v_{0 } + |\\phi|^2 \\frac{v_0}{m^2 } + \\dots \\label{sugra}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 .",
    "since inflation is driven by the non - zero value of @xmath62 , we see that the resultant breaking of supersymmetry gives all scalar fields a contribution to their mass - squared of @xmath63 , in conflict with the slow - roll condition ( [ slowroll ] ) on @xmath28 .",
    "this is the essential problem one must solve if one is to implement inflation in a supergravity theory .",
    "however , as stressed earlier , the problem is relatively mild when compared to the non - supersymmetric case because the suppression for @xmath28 need only be by a factor of 10 or so .",
    "there have been several proposals for dealing with this problem .",
    "one widely explored possibility is d - term inflation @xcite .",
    "in particular one may consider an anomalous d - term in eq.([v ] ) of the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a constant and @xmath66 are scalar fields charged under the anomalous @xmath67 with charge @xmath68 . such a term , for vanishing @xmath66 , gives a constant term in the potential but does not contribute in leading order to the masses of uncharged scalar fields .",
    "the latter occur in radiative order only giving a contribution to their mass - squared equal to @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and typically @xmath71 for an effective coupling @xmath72 between the charged and neutral fields .    the other suggested ways out of the @xmath28 problem do not require non - zero d - terms during inflation but rather provide reasons why the quadratic term in eq.([sugra ] ) should be anomalously small .",
    "one possibility follows from the fact that the mass term of @xmath73 coming from eq.([sugra ] ) actually applies at the planck scale .",
    "since we are considering inflation for field values near the origin the inflaton mass must be run down to low scales . as shown in ref.@xcite ,",
    "in a wide class of models in which the gauge couplings become large at the planck scale the low energy supersymmetry breaking soft masses are driven much smaller at low scales by radiative corrections .",
    "the typical effect is to reduce the mass by a factor @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a gauge coupling evaluated at the scale @xmath76 .",
    "while radiative corrections can cause a significant change in the coupling , the effect is limited and becomes smaller as the gauge coupling becomes small .",
    "for this reason the effective mass at low scales can not be arbitrarily small and typically @xmath77 .",
    "it is also possible to construct models in which the contribution to the scalar mass exhibited in eq.([sugra ] ) is cancelled by further contributions coming from the expansion of @xmath54 in eq.([v ] ) .",
    "one interesting example which arises in specific superstring theories was discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "another occurs in supergravity models of the ` no - scale ' type @xcite . in these examples , while the scalar mass is absent in leading order , it typically arises in radiative order and so again there is an expectation that the effective mass can not be arbitrarily small .",
    "to summarise , in all these cases for small field values the effective supergravity potential can be conveniently parameterised as a constant term plus a quadratic term involving a real inflaton field @xmath78 ( the real part of @xmath2 ) i.e. just the form of eq.([newinflation ] ) .",
    "however this is the form at tree level only . in general radiative corrections",
    "cause the effective mass , @xmath79    to depend logarithmically on @xmath78 .",
    "thus the full potential has the form @xmath80 . \\label{pot}\\ ] ] note that in eq.([pot ] ) we have not included a term linear in @xmath81 .",
    "such a term can be forbidden if the theory has a symmetry under which @xmath78 transforms non - trivially and we assume that this is indeed the case .",
    "the form of eq.([pot ] ) provides a useful parameterisation of the inflationary potential in the neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "however when @xmath82 is large higher order terms may be significant and so it is important to determine their structure .",
    "such terms may occur through higher order terms in @xmath53 or @xmath54 in eq.([g ] ) or in higher order terms in the expansion of eq.([sugra ] ) .",
    "typically these terms are expected be associated with new physics at the planck scale , for example a term in the superpotential of the form @xmath83 will give rise to terms of the form @xmath84 in the scalar potential .",
    "however it may happen that such higher order terms arise as a result of integrating out heavy fields in the theory , in which case the mass scale in the denominator can be much smaller than @xmath34 . for example the superpotential @xmath85 describes a field @xmath86 with mass @xmath87 . at scales below @xmath87",
    "the field @xmath86 may be integrated out to give the effective superpotential @xmath88 in which the scale of the higher dimension operator is set by @xmath87 .",
    "this mass may be associated with any of the scales in the theory , e.g. the inflationary scale or the supersymmetry breaking scale , and can thus be much smaller than the planck scale .    with this preamble",
    "we now consider the structure of the terms responsible for ending inflation consider first the inflationary models driven by a non - zero f - term .",
    "this is conveniently parameterised by the superpotential @xmath89 which gives @xmath90 as required .",
    "radiative corrections then lead to the form of eq.([pot ] ) .",
    "now consider the form of higher order corrections to this superpotential .",
    "the terms allowed must be consistent with any gauge or discrete symmetries of the models . for example the above form linear in @xmath91 follows if @xmath91 carries non - zero @xmath92-symmetry charge under an unbroken @xmath92-symmetry .",
    "using such symmetries it is straightforward to construct a general potential displaying the possibilities for ending inflation .",
    "we suppose that @xmath2 is a singlet under the @xmath92-symmetry but carries a charge under a discrete @xmath93 symmetry",
    ". then the superpotential has the form @xmath94 where we have suppressed the coefficients of @xmath10 of each term .",
    "this gives rise to the potential @xmath95 plus terms involving @xmath91 which we drop as they do not contribute to the vacuum energy ( since @xmath91 does not acquire a vacuum expectation value ) .",
    "this has the desired structure for ending inflation because the potential vanishes for @xmath96 for @xmath97 . for our analysis we use a slightly simplified form of eq.([einf ] ) ( c.f .",
    "eq.([einfp ] ) ) keeping only the leading @xmath98 term and setting @xmath99 to take account of the possibility discussed above that the scale associated with the higher dimension operators may be below the planck scale .",
    "the situation is similar for the case of @xmath100-term inflation . from eq.([dterm ] ) we see there is a contribution of the form of eq.([einf ] ) .",
    "if @xmath101 is a heavy field it may be integrated out in a similar manner to that discussed above so that the term @xmath102 may give rise to a higher dimension term of the form @xmath103 thus the parameterisation of eq.([einfp ] ) may apply to this case as well .",
    "we wish to study locally supersymmetric slow - roll inflationary models in which the inflaton field evolves from small to large field values . near the origin",
    "the term involving the lowest power of the inflaton field is the most important in the potential , hence a simple parameterisation is adequate . as discussed above",
    ", we may take the inflaton field , @xmath78 , to be real with a quadratic potential of the form ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to work with dimensionless quantities @xmath104 in terms of which the potential and its derivatives are given by @xmath105 during slow - roll inflation with @xmath106 , one has @xmath107 hence at @xmath108 , the spectrum of the scalar perturbations ( [ deltah ] ) can be written as @xmath109 where the spectral index is @xmath110 the @xmath111 sign in eq.([delta ] ) takes into account that @xmath112 is positive ( negative ) at @xmath108 corresponding to the inflaton rolling towards smaller ( bigger ) values of @xmath113 .",
    "we focus on the latter case as it offers a simple way of ending inflation as the field value increases and higher order terms in @xmath113 become important .    the number of e - folds before the end of inflation when the fluctuations observed by cobe were generated is @xmath114 assuming instant reheating ; the numerical value would be smaller if reheating is inefficient or if there are later episodes of ` thermal inflation ' @xcite . in our model",
    "the end of inflation occurs due to terms of higher order in @xmath2 of the form given in eq.([einf ] ) . for the moment we parameterise their effect through the inclusion of a further parameter @xmath115 , the value of the field at the end of inflation .",
    "the number of e - folds from @xmath116 onwards should equal or exceed @xmath117 , giving @xmath118 in addition the slow - roll conditions during inflation require @xmath119 where @xmath120 is of @xmath10 ( and can be calculated exactly in the slow - roll formalism ) .",
    "if eqs.([delta ] , [ si ] , [ efolds ] ) satisfy the observational constraints ( [ cobe],[ncobe ] , [ ncobe ] ) the inflationary era will lead to a satisfactory cosmology . for @xmath121 the term proportional to @xmath122 in eq.([pot ] )",
    "is negligible .",
    "we shall concentrate on this limit ( although acceptable inflation is also possible if this is not the case ) .",
    "then eq.([si ] ) constrains the quantity @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "further , eq.([delta ] ) constrains a combination of @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "given that we have four parameters to satisfy these equations and that eq.([vpp ] ) can be satisfied for a range of parameters , we see that acceptable inflation follows for a range of @xmath45 .",
    "this opens up the possibility of having a much lower value for the inflationary energy scale than is usually considered .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is very sensitive to the the value of @xmath127 and so it is necessary to consider in some detail what determines the latter .",
    "we will discuss this shortly but first we consider how a reduction in the scale of inflation , @xmath45 , may allow thermal effects to naturally set the initial conditions for inflation .",
    "we assume that some process at the planck scale , presumably quantum cosmological in nature @xcite , creates a homogeneous patch of space - time and releases energy thermalising the universe .",
    "it is important to note that the thermalisation temperature can not be close to the planck scale , regardless of the amount of energy released , essentially because particle interactions are asymptotically free .",
    "for example , an explicit calculation of the @xmath128 annihilation rate into gluons finds that equilibrium can only be attained below a temperature @xmath129  gev @xcite .",
    "let us consider the requirements on the inflaton field for it to be localised at the origin through its couplings to particles in the thermal bath . on dimensional grounds ,",
    "the @xmath130 scattering / annihilation cross - sections at energies higher than the masses of the particles involved are expected to decrease with increasing temperature as @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the coupling .",
    "thus if the scattering / annihilation rate , @xmath133 is to exceed the hubble expansion rate @xmath134 in the radiation - dominated plasma , then we have a limit on the thermalisation temperature @xmath135 , where @xmath136 counts the relativistic degrees of freedom ( = 915/4 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at high temperatures ) . now a yukawa coupling @xmath137 of the inflaton to mssm fields @xmath138 will generate a confining potential at high temperatures , @xmath139 i.e. an effective mass for the inflaton of @xmath140 .",
    "this will rapidly drive the inflaton field to the origin in a time of @xmath141 as the universe cools , the potential energy @xmath142 of the inflaton will begin to dominate over the thermal energy at a temperature @xmath143 . at this epoch the inflaton field will be localised to a region @xmath144 in the neighbourhood of the origin . thus to provide natural initial conditions for new inflation we require that @xmath145 i.e. that the scale of inflation be sufficiently low .",
    "the discussion above yields the constraint @xmath146 , taking @xmath147 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the end of inflation will be determined by terms which are _ not _ included in the expansion of the inflationary potential keeping only terms up to quadratic order . in general such terms",
    "are quite model dependent as all orders in @xmath2 may contribute significantly for large @xmath2 .",
    "however it is necessary to discuss the expectation for @xmath115 for reasonable forms of the potential since the nature of the inflationary era is strongly dependent on it . in section  [ eta ]",
    "we have discussed how higher order terms arise in supergravity theories and how they are restricted by the symmetries of the theory but here we will simply write down the structure of these terms motivated by such considerations .",
    "although this parameterisation involves only a single inflaton field in the present context , it actually covers a wide range of models including hybrid inflationary models in which the end of inflation is triggered by a second field .",
    "the full inflationary potential then has the form : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a coupling which for simplicity we set to unity ( its most natural value ? ) in our calculations .",
    "the end of slow - roll occurs at @xmath150 using this we may now determine the range of parameters for which acceptable inflation obtains by identifying @xmath126 with the field value at which the fluctuations observed by cobe were generated . in figure  [ fig1 ] we show the required inflationary scale for various values of @xmath151 , setting @xmath152 and adopting @xmath153 .",
    "the essential observation is that the quadratic potential generates acceptable inflation for a wide range of values of @xmath45 .",
    "this is important because it opens up the possibility of identifying the inflationary scale with a mass scale already required in the particle physics model .",
    "further if @xmath154 , thermal effects will be important in setting the initial conditions for inflation . for the cases shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , inflation typically ends at @xmath155 and the fluctuations observed by cobe exited the hubble radius at @xmath156 , about 50 e - folds of expansion earlier .",
    "we have checked that in all cases @xmath157 exceeds @xmath158 so that there will be sufficient inflation starting with thermal initial conditions .",
    "we have studied in very general terms , an inflationary era driven by a quadratic potential .",
    "the essential requirement for successful inflation is that the inflaton mass be reduced below the hubble parameter .",
    "we have discussed mechanisms which do this , concentrating on the situation where the inflaton mass - squared is negative at the origin .",
    "this has the advantage that thermal initial conditions naturally place the inflaton at the origin , initiating the inflationary era .",
    "whether such inflation occurs is a model dependent question . in compactified string theories the multiplet structure",
    "is completely determined and typically there are many scalar fields with the properties of the inflaton discussed here . in such models inflation driven by",
    "a quadratic potential is a very natural possibility .    in order for the above mechanism to work",
    ", the inflaton must couple to the fields in the thermal bath and the scale of its potential must be sufficiently low .",
    "in fact the quadratic parametrization of the inflationary potential allows any value for the inflationary scale @xmath45 .",
    "this is essentially because the end of inflation occurs not due to the violation of the slow - roll conditions by the quadratic potential , but due to higher order non - renormalisable terms which become important as the inflaton evolves towards large field values .",
    "two values for the inflationary scale are of particular interest and will be discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "one has @xmath159 , the supersymmetry breaking scale in the hidden sector .",
    "the other with @xmath160 implements inflation at the electroweak scale and could be relevant in the context of theories with submillimeter dimensions ."
