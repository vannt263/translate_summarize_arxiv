    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are good candidates for the @xmath6 molecular states @xcite , however , their cousins @xmath7 and @xmath8 lie considerably higher than the corresponding thresholds , it is difficult to identify them as the @xmath9 and @xmath10 molecular states , respectively",
    ". there may be different dynamics which dominate the @xmath11 mesons below and above @xmath12 respectively , and result in two scalar nonets below @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "the structures of the nonet scalar mesons in the ideal mixing limit can be symbolically written as @xcite @xmath28 the four light isospin-@xmath29 @xmath30 resonances near @xmath31 , known as the @xmath8 mesons , have not been firmly established yet , there are still controversy about their existence due to the large width and nearby @xmath30 threshold @xcite .    in general , we may expect constructing the tetraquark currents and studying the nonet scalar mesons below @xmath12 as the tetraquark states with the qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "for the conventional mesons and baryons , the `` single - pole + continuum states '' model works well in representing the phenomenological spectral densities , the continuum states are usually approximated by the contributions from the asymptotic quarks and gluons , the borel windows are rather large and reliable qcd sum rules can be obtained . however , for the light flavor multiquark states , we can not obtain a borel window to satisfy the two criteria ( pole dominance and convergence of the operator product expansion ) of the qcd sum rules @xcite . in ref.@xcite , t. v. brito et al take the quarks as the basic quantum fields , and study the scalar mesons @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 as the diquak - antidiquark states with the qcd sum rules , and can not obtain borel windows to satisfy the two criteria , and resort to a compromise between the two criteria .",
    "for the heavy tetraquark states and molecular states , the two criteria can be satisfied , but the borel windows are rather small @xcite .",
    "we can take the colored diquarks as point particles and describe them as the basic scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , axial - vector and tensor fields respectively to overcome the embarrassment @xcite . in this article",
    ", we construct the color singlet tetraquark currents with the scalar diquark fields , parameterize the nonperturbative effects with new vacuum condensates besides the gluon condensate , and perform the standard procedure of the qcd sum rules to study the nonet scalar mesons below @xmath12 .",
    "the qcd sum rules are `` new '' because the interpolating currents are constructed from the basic diquark fields instead of the quark and gluon fields .",
    "whether or not the colored diquarks can be taken as basic constituents is of great importance , because it provides a new spectroscopy for the mesons and baryons @xcite .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we derive the new qcd sum rules for the nonet scalar mesons in sect.2 ; in sect.3 , we present the numerical results and discussions ; and sect.4 is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "in the following , we write down the interpolating currents for the nonet scalar mesons below @xmath12 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 the @xmath34 are color indices , the @xmath35 is the charge conjugation matrix , the @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are basic scalar diquark fields , while the @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the corresponding scalar two - quark currents . in this article , we take the isospin limit for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 quarks , and denote the fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xmath44 .    for the general color antitriplet bilinear quark - quark fields @xmath45 , @xmath40 and @xmath41",

    "the attractive interaction of one - gluon exchange favors formation of the diquarks in color antitriplet @xmath65 , flavor antitriplet @xmath66 and spin singlet @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd studies of the light flavors indicate that the strong attraction in the scalar diquark channels favors the formation of good diquarks , the weaker attraction ( the quark - quark correlation is rather weak ) in the axial - vector diquark channels maybe form bad diquarks , the energy gap between the axial - vector and scalar diquarks is about @xmath68 of the @xmath69-nucleon mass splitting , i.e. @xmath70 @xcite , which is also expected from the hypersplitting color - spin interaction @xmath71 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the studies based on the random instanton liquid model indicate that the instanton induced quark - quark interactions are weakly repulsive in the vector and axial - vector channels , strongly repulsive in the pseudoscalar channel , and strongly attractive in the scalar and tensor channels @xcite .",
    "so it is sensible to use the scalar diquark fields to construct the tetraquark currents .",
    "the two - point correlation functions @xmath72 can be written as @xmath73 denotes @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we can insert a complete set of intermediate hadronic states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators @xmath78 into the correlation functions @xmath79 to obtain the hadronic representation @xcite . isolating the ground state contributions from the pole terms of the nonet scalar mesons",
    ", we obtain the results , @xmath80 where the @xmath81 are the ground state masses , the @xmath82 are corresponding pole residues defined by @xmath83 , the thresholds @xmath84 in the channels @xmath85 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 respectively , the @xmath86 are the thresholds for the higher resonances and continuum states @xmath87 , and the @xmath88 are the corresponding hadronic spectral densities .    we introduce the following new lagrangian @xmath89 , @xmath90 where @xmath91 , and carry out the operator product expansion with the basic diquark fields @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath16 instead of the quark fields @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath94 , and we have neglected the terms concerning the heavy diquark fields in the lagrangian . in the qcd , the basic quantum fields are the quark and gluon fields , the attractive interactions in the color antitriplet @xmath65 , flavor antitriplet @xmath95 and spin singlet @xmath67 quark - quark channels favor formation of the scalar diquarks , we can absorb some effects of the quark - gluon interactions into the effective diquark masses , which are characterized by the correlation length @xmath96 . at the distance @xmath97 , the @xmath98 diquark state combines with one quark or one @xmath99 antidiquark to form a baryon state or a tetraquark state , while at the distance @xmath100 , the @xmath98 diquark states dissociate into asymptotic quarks and gluons gradually ,",
    "the strength of the quark - quark correlations is very weak .",
    "just like the quarks , the diquarks have three colors , and can be gauged with the same @xmath0 color group to embody the residual quark - gluon interactions .        in calculations ,",
    "we take into account all diagrams like the typical ones shown in fig.1 , introduce new vacuum diquark condensates @xmath101 and @xmath102 besides the gluon condensate to parameterize the nonperturbative qcd vacuum , and consider the vacuum condensates up to dimension four . in the qcd sum rules ,",
    "the high dimensional vacuum condensates are usually suppressed by large denominators or additional powers of the inverse borel parameters @xmath103 , the net contributions are very small . for example",
    ", in the present case the contributions of the dimension-6 vacuum condensates can be estimated as @xmath104 , which is a tiny quantity .",
    "if additional suppressions originate from the denominators are taken into account , the contributions are even smaller , and can be safely neglected .",
    "once the analytical results are obtained , then we can take the dualities below the thresholds @xmath105 and perform the borel transform with respect to the variable @xmath106 , finally we obtain the following sum rules , @xmath107 where the @xmath108 denote the qcd spectral densities @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath112\\delta(s-\\widehat{m}_{q / s}^2)\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 in the channels @xmath85 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 respectively , and the @xmath116 is the borel parameter .",
    "the threshold parameters @xmath117 are different from the corresponding @xmath118 in eq.(6 ) , because we absorb some qcd interactions into the effective diquark masses .",
    "differentiate eq.(8 ) with respect to @xmath103 , then eliminate the pole residues @xmath119 , we can obtain the sum rules for the masses of the nonet scalar mesons , @xmath120",
    "we estimate the vacuum diquark condensates @xmath101 and @xmath102 with the assumption of the vacuum saturation , which works well in the large @xmath121 limit , @xmath122 where the @xmath61 is a quantity has dimension of mass and can be taken as the confinement energy scale @xmath123 . at the energy scale @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 @xcite , and @xmath128 .",
    "the quark condensates play a special role being responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , and relate with the masses and decay constants of the light pseudoscalar mesons through the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xcite .",
    "the values of other vacuum condensates , such as the mixed condensates , the four quark condensates and the gluon condensates , can not be obtained from the first principles , we usually calculate them with the lattice qcd , the instanton models , or determine them empirically by fitting the qcd sum rules to the experimental data . in this article",
    ", we introduce the diquark condensates @xmath101 and @xmath102 to parameterize the nonperturbative qcd vacuum , and assume that they relate with the four quark condensates ( therefore they have implicit relations with the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry ) , and take the dimension - one parameter @xmath61 to be the confinement energy scale , as the scalar mesons @xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 are bound states which consist of the confined quarks and gluons , and some parameters are needed to embody the confinement . on the other hand , we can understand the parameter @xmath123 as a fitted value , which happens to be the confinement energy scale , the crude estimation works well .",
    "we take the updated values of the diquark masses from the qcd sum rules for consistency , where the interpolating currents @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are used @xcite , @xmath129 and @xmath130 ; the scalar diquarks were originally studied with the qcd sum rules about twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "there have been several theoretical approaches to estimate the diquark masses , for example , the simple constituent diquark mass plus hyperfine spin - spin interaction model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath4 are well established , and the existence of the @xmath7 meson is confirmed , although there are controversy about its mass and width , the values listed in the review of particle physics are @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively @xcite .",
    "as far as the @xmath8 are concerned , there are still controversy about their existence , we take them as the @xmath16-wave isospin-@xmath29 @xmath30 resonance with the breit - wigner mass about @xmath133 . the e791 collaboration observed a low - mass scalar @xmath30 resonance with the breit - wigner mass @xmath134 and width @xmath135 respectively in the decay @xmath136 @xcite , and the bes collaboration observed a clear low mass enhancement in the invariant @xmath30 mass distribution in the decay @xmath137 with the breit - wigner mass @xmath138 and width @xmath139 , respectively @xcite .",

    "it is sensible to estimate @xmath143 . on the other hand ,",
    "the qcd sum rules for the tetraquark states indicate that @xmath144 and @xmath145 @xcite .    assuming the energy gap between the ground and first radial excited tetraquark states is about @xmath146",
    ", we can tentatively determine the threshold parameters @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",

    "the two criteria ( pole dominance and convergence of the operator product expansion ) of the qcd sum rules are well satisfied .",
    "if the conventional quark currents are chosen , the multiquark states i.e. tetraquark states , pentaquark states , hexaquark states , etc , have the spectral densities @xmath159 with the largest @xmath160 , the integral @xmath161 converges slowly @xcite .",
    "if one do nt want to release the criterion of pole dominance , we have to either postpone the threshold parameter @xmath105 to very large value or choose very small value for the borel parameter @xmath162 .",
    "with large value of the threshold parameter @xmath105 , for example , @xmath163 , here @xmath164 stands for the ground state , the contributions from the high resonance states and continuum states are included in , we can not use single - pole ( or ground state ) approximation for the spectral densities ; on the other hand , with very small value of the borel parameter @xmath162 , the borel window @xmath165 shrinks to zero or very small values .    the numerical values of the masses and pole residues are presented in table 1 and figs.3 - 4 . from table 1",
