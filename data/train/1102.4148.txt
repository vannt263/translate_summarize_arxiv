    "the links between the theory of cluster algebras @xcite and functional identities for the rogers dilogarithm first became apparent through fomin - zelevinsky s proof @xcite of zamolodchikov s periodicity conjecture for @xmath0-systems @xcite ( we refer to @xcite and the references given there for the latest developments in periodicity in cluster theory and its applications to @xmath1-systems , @xmath0-systems and dilogarithm identities ) .",
    "this link was exploited by fock - goncharov @xcite , who emphasize the central rle of the ( quantum ) dilogarithm both for commutative and for quantum cluster algebras and varieties .",
    "the quantum dilogarithm is also a key ingredient in kontsevich - soibelman s interpretation @xcite of cluster transformations in the framework of donaldson - thomas theory . indeed ,",
    "kontsevich - soibelman show that , under suitable technical hypotheses , if two quivers with potential are related by a mutation @xcite , then their non commutative dt - invariants ( _ cf .",
    "_  section  [ ss : intertwiners ] ) are linked by the composition of a monomial transformation with the adjoint action of a quantum dilogarithm .",
    "this composition coincides with fock - goncharov s cluster transformation for quantum @xmath0-variables @xcite .",
    "therefore , kontsevich - soibelman s categorical setup for dt - theory contains a ` categorification ' of the quantum @xmath0-seed mutations and thus , modulo passage to the ` double torus ' @xcite or to ` principal coefficients ' @xcite , of the quantum @xmath2-seed mutations . by extending this idea to compositions of mutations",
    "nagao @xcite has succeeded in deducing the main theorems on the ( additive ) categorification of cluster algebras @xcite ( _ cf . _",
    "also @xcite ) from joyce s @xcite and joyce - song s @xcite results in dt - theory ( _ cf . _  also @xcite ) .",
    "our aim in the present survey is to give an introduction to this circle of ideas using quantum dilogarithm identities as a leitmotif .",
    "we start with the classical pentagon identity ( section  [ ss : sfk - identity ] ) .",
    "following reineke @xcite @xcite and kontsevich - soibelman @xcite @xcite we link it to the study of stability functions for a dynkin quiver of type @xmath3 and present reineke s generalization to arbitrary dynkin quivers ( theorem  [ thm : reineke ] ) .",
    "we sketch reineke s beautiful and instructive proof in section  [ s : proof - of - reinekes - theorem ] .",
    "the result can be interpreted as stating that the refined dt - invariant of a dynkin ( and even an acyclic ) quiver is well - defined . in this form , it is conjectured to generalize to an arbitrary quiver with a potential with complex coefficients ( section  [ ss : dt - invar - qp ] ) .",
    "evidence for this is given in kontsevich - soibelman s deep work @xcite . in section  [ s : dt - invariants - and - mutations ] , we study the behaviour of the refined dt - invariant under mutations following section  8.4 of @xcite .",
    "we begin by recalling the categorical setup : the category of finite - dimensional representations of the jacobi - algebra of the given quiver with potential is embedded as the heart of the canonical t - structure in the @xmath4-calabi - yau category @xmath5 , the full subcategory formed by the homologically finite - dimensional dg modules over the ginzburg @xcite dg algebra @xmath6 associated with the given quiver with potential . in @xmath5 , the simple representations form a spherical collection ( section  [ ss : setup ] ) in the sense of @xcite .",
    "mutation is modeled by ` tilting ' the heart ( section  [ ss : comparison - of - categories ] ) , an idea going back to bridgeland @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite @xcite .",
    "the comparison formula for the refined dt - invariants then becomes a simple consequence of the freedom in the choice of a stability function ( section  [ ss : comparison - of - invariants ] ) .",
    "the refined dt - invariant is defined to be rational ( section  [ ss : rational - case ] ) if its adjoint action is given by a rational transformation .",
    "this is the case in large classes of examples coming from representation theory , lie theory and higher teichmller theory . in this case , the adjoint action is the ` non commutative dt - invariant ' @xcite , whose behaviour under mutations is governed by fock - goncharov s mutation rule for quantum @xmath0-variables ( section  [ ss : intertwiners ] ) .",

    "we define an autoequivalence of @xmath5 respectively @xmath11 to be reachable if its effect on the inital cluster collection ( respectively cluster tilting sequence ) is given by a composition of mutations .",
    "we obtain a homomorphism @xmath15 from the group of reachable autoequivalences of the ambient triangulated category to the group of automorphisms of the functor @xmath16 ( sections  [ ss : action - autoequivalences - der - cat ] and [ ss : action - autoequivalences - cluster - cat ] ) .",
    "if the loop functor @xmath17 of the ambient category is reachable , then the non commutative dt - invariant equals @xmath18 ( under the assumptions which ensure that it is well - defined ) .",
    "for example , in the context of the quivers with potential associated with pairs of dynkin diagrams @xcite , the loop functor is reachable and of finite order , which shows that the non commutative dt - invariant is of finite order in this case .",
    "this fact is of interest in string theory , _ cf .",
    "_  section  8 in @xcite , which builds on @xcite .",
    "following an idea of nagao @xcite we introduce the groupoid of nearby cluster collections in section  [ ss : nearby - cluster - collections ] and show how it can be used to prove theorem  [ thm : main - thm ] ( section  [ ss : proof - main - thm ] ) and to reconstruct the refined dt - invariant ( theorem  [ thm : reconstruct - refined ] ) .",
    "we conclude by presenting a purely combinatorial realization of the groupoid of nearby cluster collections : the tropical groupoid . in many cases",
    ", it allows for a purely combinatorial construction of the refined dt - invariant ( section  [ ss : tropical - groupoid ] ) .",

    "then we have @xmath26 which explains the choice of the notation @xmath27 ( for the mysterious scaling factor , _ cf . _  remark  [ ss : remark - scaling - factor ] ) .",
    "the quantum dilogarithm has many remarkable properties ( _ cf .",
