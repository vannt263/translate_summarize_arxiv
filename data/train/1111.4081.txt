    "the anderson model , introduced about 50 years ago @xcite , is the simplest model describing the effects of disorder in a quantum system in a relatively realistic way .",
    "it has however been recognized rather early that the model probably relied on too strong simplifications to match the actual behavior of electrons in a crystal : the anderson model is a one - particle model at zero temperature . moreover ,",
    "the difficulty of experimental investigations in condensed matter systems @xcite prompted a search for other systems where such effects could be observed in more favorable conditions , leading to studies of the localization of electromagnetic waves @xcite and sound waves @xcite , where particle interactions are obviously absent .",
    "a breakthrough has been recently realized by using laser - cooled atoms @xcite , a development inscribed in a more general trend of studying many - body systems with ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "one of the long - standing questions concerning the anderson model is the effect of particle - particle interactions .",
    "it was conjectured that the electron - electron coulomb repulsion would suppress localization .",
    "including such effects in the model , however , implies going from a `` simple '' one - particle picture to a very complex many - body description .",
    "the problem of interactions is very rich in disordered ultracold atomic systems : for such systems , the interaction strength can be driven from repulsive to attractive , _ via _ the so - called feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "moreover , by choosing the atomic species , the quantum statistics can also be changed from fermi - dirac to bose - einstein ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one can conjecture , for example , that attractive interactions shall _ increase _ localization in a cold bose gas , but not in a fermi gas .",
    "all possible combinations of the sign of interactions and quantum statistics can be similarly considered  @xcite .",
    "mean - field theories , which simplify considerably the many - body problem , were generally considered to give a rather poor description of the electronic many - body problem in a crystal @xcite .",
    "however , it became clear in recent years that these theories give , on the contrary , a very satisfactory description of ultracold bose gases with ( weak ) interactions in a variety of situations @xcite .",
    "this puts into evidence the interest of studying cold atoms in the presence of disorder .    the first experimental result in this new field was the observation of `` dynamical localization '' , a manifestation of the anderson localization in the momentum space , by raizen and co - workers , in 1994 @xcite .",
    "anderson localization of bosons in 1d @xcite and 1d localization in the aubry - andr model @xcite , have also been observed experimentally , and , recently , observations of the 3d localization of fermions @xcite and bosons @xcite were claimed .",
    "the effect of interactions is also being studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "finally , the anderson metal - insulator transition is being actively studied with a cold atom `` quantum simulator '' of the 3d anderson model @xcite , including , the experimental determination of its critical exponent @xcite and the study of its critical state @xcite .",
    "we start by considering the tight - binding description of an one - dimensional ( ordered ) lattice of period @xmath0 obtained by projecting the eigenstates of the spatially periodic hamiltonian on a basis of localized functions , usually wannier functions @xmath1 , associated with each site @xmath2 : @xmath3 which produces a discretized eigenvalue problem@xmath4 we use here the ( usual ) symmetric first - neighbors approximation @xmath5 and , as usual , rescale time such that @xmath6 ( and energies correspondingly : @xmath7 ) in order to obtain the tight - binding equation:@xmath8 if all sites have the same diagonal energy , one can redefine the energy origin so that @xmath9 , then @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the quasimomentum , @xmath12 are the energies on the first band , @xmath13 is the density of states .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath14 are delocalized bloch waves of quasimomentum @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the anderson model postulates that the main effect of crystalline disorder is to randomize the @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : htb ] ) in an interval @xmath17 $ ] , an approximation known as `` diagonal disorder '' .",
    "the introduction of disorderredistributes the eigenenergies between the values @xmath18 and @xmath19 and , more importantly , produces a _ localization _ of the corresponding eigenfunctions .. ] we shall index the eigenfunctions by @xmath20 so that @xmath21 is at the center @xmath22 of the energy band .",
    "the shape of a given eigenfunction depends on @xmath23 and on the realization @xmath24 of the disorder , but if one averages the eigenfunctions in a given energy interval @xmath25 $ ] over many realizations of the disorder one finds an exponential shape@xmath26 ( we use overbars to indicate averages over realizations of the disorder ) where @xmath27 is the _ localization length_. in the 1d case and in the limit of weak disorder one can show that @xcite@xmath28 which vanishes at the borders of the band and has its maximum value @xmath29 at the center of the band .",
    "this localization can be interpreted by noting that , in the absence of disorder , all sites have identical energies , so the particle can tunnel from a site to the next one , generating a diffusive motion which leads , asymptotically , to a complete delocalization in the lattice . in the presence of diagonal disorder , however , it is unlikely that neighbor sites have close enough energies , so that in general , the particle can only perform _ virtual _ transition to neighbor sites , which leads to a localized exponential spreading of the eigenfunction .",
    "we take into account interactions by using a mean - field approximation .",
    "the decomposition eq .",
    "( [ eq : wannierdecomposition ] ) is used to transform and keeps only the `` diagonal '' nonlinear term . ] the gross - pitaevskii equation ( or nonlinear schrdinger equation ) in a discrete nonlinear set of equations@xmath30 where @xmath31 is the parameter characterizing atom - atom interactions , proportional to the @xmath32-wave diffusion length @xcite .",
    "disorder is introduced by randomizing @xmath16 , as before .",
    "this model is occasionally named danse ( discrete anderson nonlinear schrdinger equation ) .",
    "as we use mean - field theory throughout this work , we shall use the terms `` interaction '' and `` nonlinearity '' interchangeably .",
    "the main question in the problem of interacting disordered systems is , will interactions destroy localization ? the danse model has been used , e.g. by pikovskii and shepelyansky @xcite , to investigate this question .",
    "they observed numerically a revival of diffusion , leading , at very long times ( @xmath33 ) , to a @xmath34 sub - diffusive behavior with @xmath35 .",
    "other works also tackled this problem , with somewhat contradictory results .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , the use of the so - called `` participation number '' @xmath36 ( instead of @xmath37 ) as the quantity characterizing diffusion , lead to the conclusion that localization survives even in presence of a moderate nonlinearity , but subsequent studies @xcite confirmed the existence of a subdiffusive dynamics , with an exponent @xmath38 that typically depends on the initial state .",

    "two nonlinear effects play a particularly important role in our study .",
    "the first one is the called _ self - trapping _ , which manifests itself when a given site @xmath2 has a much larger population than its neighbors . in such case , the correction @xmath47 decouples it from its neighbors ( much as the disorder itself does ) , thus inhibiting diffusion .",
    "the second effect is the existence of chaotic behaviors ( in a classical sense  that is , chaos related to sensitivity to initial conditions ) , due to the presence of nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the chaotic evolution of the amplitudes @xmath48 may generate strong variations of the nonlinear correction @xmath47 , eventually bringing , even if only for a short time , neighbor sites close to degeneracy , thus favoring diffusion . in the presence of both disorder and interactions , different regimes",
    "are possible : localization is expected to survive ( or at least be destroyed only at very long times ) if interactions are weak enough compared to disorder , diffusion ( or subdiffusion ) induced by the chaotic evolution is expected if these two effects are of the same order of magnitude , and self - trapping is expected to dominate , inhibiting diffusion , in the regime of strong interactions .",
    "these regimes have indeed been observed numerically  @xcite .",
    "it can be tempting to classify these regimes by comparing @xmath47 to @xmath46 , but one must not forget that , as @xmath47 depends on @xmath49 , the dynamics _ depends on the particular trajectory of the system in the @xmath48 space_. such a classification scheme is thus useless to define `` phases '' of the system .",
