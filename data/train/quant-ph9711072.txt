    "<S> it is assumed that the quantum state that may describe a macroscopic system at a given instant of time is one of the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix calculated from the wave function of the system plus its environment . </S>",

    "<S> it is then reasonable to ask what are the properties of quantum states of macroscopic systems . in order to fit experience , </S>",
    "<S> such a quantum state should yield extremely small standard deviation for both the position and the momentum of the center of mass . on the other hand , due to the large number of particles contained in macroscopic bodies </S>",
    "<S> , they possess an extremely high energy level density , or an extremely small average level spacing . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , a macroscopic system @xmath0 can not be isolated from its environment @xmath1 , hence , according to orthodox quantum mechanics , it can not be characterized by a wave function , only by a suitable reduced density matrix @xmath2 , resulting from the wave function @xmath3 of the composite system @xmath4 by taking the partial trace of @xmath5 over the hilbert space of the environment.@xcite    nevertheless , it is still possible to assign a wave function to the system @xmath0 . to show this , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a simplified description of a spin measurement on a spin - half particle . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the @xmath6 spin component is measured , and initially the particle is in the state @xmath7 , which is the eigenstate of the @xmath8 operator corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> then the measurement process may be symbolically written as @xmath10 stands for the initial state of the measuring device , and @xmath11 stands for the state of the measuring device when it shows the result @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal arrow denotes the ( unitary ) time evolution , satisfying the schrdinger equation .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , if the initial state of the particle is @xmath12 , corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath13 , the measurement process can be written as @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) , then , owing to the linearity of the schrdinger equation we may write @xmath16 .    looking at the final state of the system , one can see that the measuring device has no own wave function , instead , it can be characterized by the density matrix @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> certainly , in such a situation the result of the measurement is either @xmath9 , corresponding to the state @xmath18 , or @xmath13 , corresponding to the state @xmath19 . as the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> are orthogonal , they are just the eigenstates of @xmath20 . extrapolating the conclusion of this simple example , it is reasonable to assume that a macroscopic system is described by one of the eigenstates of its reduced density matrix @xmath20 , calculated from the wave function of the universe , and the probability that this particular eigenstate occurs is given by the corresponding eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> this has already been proposed by several authors@xcite , @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a consistent theory involving this idea can be found in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is of worth mentioning that this latter theory is an explicit counterexample to bell s theorem@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the next question is how the reduced density matrix of a macroscopic system looks like if the interaction with the environment is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this is the central problem of the phenomenon environment induced decoherence@xcite , @xcite , and as such , has been much studied in model systems . a typical </S>",
    "<S> model@xcite contains a number of harmonic oscillators playing the role of a heat bath ( this is the environment ) and a macroscopic object coupled to it . as a result of the interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the reduced density matrix of the macroscopic object becomes nearly diagonal in both coordinate and momentum representation , so that the width across the diagonal is microscopically small , while the distribution along the diagonal ( this is the probability distribution of the coordinate in coordinate representation and the probability distribution of the momentum in momentum representation ) extends to a macroscopic regime . </S>",
    "<S> note that ( up to the present author s best knowledge ) none of the decoherence models studied so far possesses the property that the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix are generically localized . </S>",
    "<S> the reason may well be that these models are oversimplified .    </S>",
    "<S> considering now the mathematical consequences of the above idea , one finds that the quantum state of a macroscopic system is a member of an orthonormed set of states . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant eigenstates of the reduced density matrix ( i.e. , those which occur with non - negligible probability ) must correspond to a macroscopic region of the classical phase space , therefore , their number is given by this phase space volume divided by planck s constant @xmath21 ( in one dimension , in @xmath22 dimension one must use @xmath23 instead ) . all the relevant eigenstates must possess the classical property that the standard deviation for both the coordinates and the momenta ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ) is microscopically small . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present paper is to answer the question whether it is possible mathematically at all .    </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to ask whether there exists such a complete , orthonormed basis that the standard deviations @xmath24 , @xmath25 for _ all _ the basis functions lie below a common bound . </S>",
    "<S> the answer is known in the one - dimensional case when the basis functions are generated from the same function by translations along the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that completeness , orthonormality and boundedness of @xmath24 and @xmath25 can not be simultaneously fulfilled .    </S>",
    "<S> we made a numerical study to decide whether it is also true if the basis functions are not generated by translations . </S>",
    "<S> the method was the following . </S>",
    "<S> initially one dimensional oscillator eigenstates @xmath28 below a given energy @xmath29 were considered . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , in this case @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> . then new basis functions @xmath31 were constructed by a unitary transformation @xmath32 for all the @xmath33 basis functions . </S>",
    "<S> ( the units were chosen so that @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 . ) as @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( similarly for @xmath39 ) , it was enough to maximize the quantity @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> the transformation matrix was built up as a product of unitary matrices , each having only one nontrivial 2 by 2 block . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding indices were randomly chosen . </S>",
    "<S> for the other indices the matrix was just the unit matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the most general 2 by 2 unitary transformation is the transformation matrix of the basic spinors which may be parametrized by three angles . for each matrix </S>",
    "<S> , these angles were chosen at random , and it was subsequently considered whether the result of this transformation gave rise to a larger sum @xmath41 or not . if yes , then the transformation was kept , if not , it was discarded . </S>",
    "<S> the method was therefore a simple monte - carlo simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure was continued until the quantity @xmath41 saturated . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting average deviations ( i.e. , the sum of @xmath42 for all the @xmath33 states divided by @xmath33 ) as a function of various @xmath33 values is plotted in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the error of the data is less than @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the measured values are surprisingly well fitted by the logarithmic function @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this result supports the generalization of the statement of ref.@xcite , i.e. , it shows that no complete , orthonormed basis with bounded standard deviations @xmath24 , @xmath25 exists .    </S>",
    "<S> returning to the original question , we show that the logarithmic dependence on @xmath33 is consistent with the requirement that the relevant eigenstates ( i.e. , those with significant probability to occur ) of the reduced density matrix must have small @xmath24 , @xmath25 values with @xmath45 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the relevant eigenstates of @xmath20 are associated with a large but finite portion of the classical phase space . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the number @xmath33 to be the ratio of this phase space volume and planck s constant @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we divide by @xmath46 , and the number @xmath33 is chosen to be the @xmath47-th root of the ratio , as the basis functions will be constructed as a @xmath47-fold direct product of the one - dimensional basis . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider only the one - dimensional case . ] </S>",
    "<S> the widths @xmath24 , @xmath25 of the relevant eigenstates are proportional to @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity remains moderate even for an astronomically large @xmath33 value . </S>",
    "<S> as an example , consider the motion of the earth . </S>",
    "<S> the linear size in coordinate space is @xmath49 m , and that in momentum space is @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the widths @xmath24 , @xmath25 are only one order of magnitude larger than those of the minimal wave packet @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> as we see , the logarithmic dependence makes the above assumption about the wave functions of macroscopic systems physically acceptable . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the problem is left open whether these states actually occur in nature and if so , what the origin of their localization property is . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , it should be due to the interaction between the macroscopic system and its environment ( as this produces the mixed state described by @xmath20 ) , but that feature of the dynamics which is responsible for classical behavior is unknown . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that the nearly diagonal shape of @xmath20 in coordinate and in momentum representation is insufficient . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , if @xmath54 with @xmath55 , the density matrix is nearly diagonal in both coordinate and momentum representation , but its eigenstates are oscillator eigenstates with @xmath56 .    here </S>",
    "<S> we consider only some consequences if the above logarithmic localization of the macroscopic quantum states actually occurs .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider first a harmonic oscillator of unit mass and frequency ( certainly , these units may be as large as 1 kg and 1 s@xmath57 ) , and calculate the mean deviation of the energy in the above localized states . certainly , the average of this quantity depends on the number of the states ( @xmath33 ) , as for larger @xmath33 the states are broader . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the average square deviation of the energy on the number of states is plotted in fig.2 .    </S>",
    "<S> somewhat surprisingly , this dependence is not logarithmic , but power - like , with the exponent @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath59 the mean energy is proportional to @xmath33 ( as @xmath33 is chosen according to the relevant classical phase space volume ) , therefore , the relative uncertainty of the energy , i.e. , @xmath60 goes to zero as @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , in case of a macroscopic oscillator this is unobservable , although @xmath62 itself can be quite large at the microscopic scale @xmath63 .    in order to understand the behavior ( [ exx ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the asymptotic behavior of the above localized states in coordinate representation . beyond @xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> they fall off as @xmath65 , due to their construction . for smaller distances ( down to some @xmath66 ) </S>",
    "<S> they decay like a power . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent is @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this readily implies that @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are constants . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior in momentum space is the same . as for the square deviation of the energy </S>",
    "<S> , we have to consider the expectation value of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> we may write e.g. @xmath72 one can derive the same linear estimate for @xmath73 as well . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that @xmath74 grows at least linearly with @xmath33 , which is consistent with the numerically obtained @xmath75 .    in order to get further consequences , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a macroscopic system being in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at temperature @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> what is the density matrix of that system at a given instant of time ? </S>",
    "<S> one would guess that it is @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 stands for the canonical partition function . </S>",
    "<S> this expression , however , substitutes a long time average , therefore , one can not expect that it is strictly valid at a given instant of time . according to the previous considerations , it is more realistic to assume that ( [ e9 ] ) gives only the long time average of the density matrix , which is actually given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is narrow in both coordinate and in momentum space if @xmath82 is not negligibly small . </S>",
    "<S> as energy eigenstates are generically not localized , the @xmath81-s are not eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath83 , therefore , @xmath20 will have nondiagonal matrix elements in energy representation . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , these matrix elements are @xmath84 , where @xmath85-s stand for the energy eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> the states @xmath81 are also localized in energy representation ( i.e. , for a given @xmath86 @xmath87 takes on significant values only for a narrow range of the energy eigenvalues @xmath88 ) , thus @xmath89 is a narrow band matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of nondiagonal matrix elements in energy representation can in principle lead to experimentally observable effects . </S>",
    "<S> suppose one isolates the macroscopic system in question so that the interaction energy @xmath90 with the environment becomes much less than the effective width @xmath62 of the density matrix in energy representation . </S>",
    "<S> under such circumstances consider the linear response of the system . for a time @xmath91 which is much less than @xmath92 but much larger than @xmath93 the deviation in the expectation value of an operator </S>",
    "<S> @xmath94 is @xmath95 \\hat \\rho(0)\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the perturbation , and the operators are heisenberg operators calculated with the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> choosing @xmath98 , the response can be cast to the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> if the density matrix were strictly diagonal in energy representation , the response @xmath101 would vanish . actually , as noted above , @xmath102 is a narrow band matrix , hence the fourier transform of the response vanishes at high frequences but becomes significant at low frequences . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the localization property of the eigenstates shows up in a suitable linear response which increases at low frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> it is a challenging question whether this behavior may be related to the celebrated @xmath103 noise@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also of worth noting that the deviation of the density matrix from the canonical expression ( [ e9 ] ) implies the breakdown of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have seen that i , in one dimension there is no localized basis in the strict sense ii , the numerically found logarithmically localized basis demonstrates that the idea that macroscopic systems are described by the eigenstates of their reduced density matrix is consistent with experienceiii , this idea implies that the density matrix of a macroscopic system being in thermal equilibrium is not diagonal in energy representation , that may be observed in the spectrum of a suitable linear response function as an enhancement at low frequences . </S>"
