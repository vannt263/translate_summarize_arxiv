    "over the past nearly three decades the phenomenon of azimuthally asymmetric particle emission in high energy heavy ion reactions , called flow in most of the relevant literature , has emerged as a general phenomenon observed over a very wide range of energies and systems .",
    "ever since flow in heavy ion collisions was discovered @xcite it was believed that basic information on the nuclear equation of state , eos , and other hot and compressed nuclear matter properties , such as viscosity , could be inferred from the data with use of hydrodynamical approaches @xcite .",
    "this approach continues to be important in the highest energy regimes available today , see recent examples in @xcite .",
    "however , special measures have to be taken to handle both the initial and the final ( freeze - out ) phases of the collision which by definition are far from the close - to - local equilibrium situation assumed in hydrodynamical theories .",
    "in the sis energy range ( @xmath6 gev ) which we cover here and which is expected to access nuclear matter up to 2.5 times saturation density , it was recognized early that microscopic transport theory that relaxes the local equilibrium assumption was necessary .",
    "such dynamical theories suitable for heavy ion reactions were developed in the eighties @xcite and continue to be improved @xcite . since",
    "then many works confronting flow data with transport code simulations have been done .",
    "the situation towards the end of the nineties was reviewed in @xcite .",
    "more recently a courageous attempt to present an eos constrained by heavy ion flow data has found wide - spread attention @xcite .",
    "however the authors state that they did not find a unique formulation of the eos that reproduces all the data. other published experimental works on flow comparing data with various transport codes come to similar conclusions @xcite : not only does one fail to reproduce all the data with a given code , there is unfortunately so far no really satisfactory agreement between the various theoretical approaches .",
    "observables other than conventional flow parameterizations have been proposed with some success . in @xcite",
    "the azimuthal modulations of radial flow were confronted with simulations using different codes . while no definite conclusions were forwarded in @xcite using a quantum molecular dynamics code @xcite , a clear preference for a soft eos was found @xcite using a boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) transport code @xcite .",
    "a drawback of @xcite was that conclusions were drawn from one code using one observable at one incident energy .",
    "a similar limitation holds for subthreshold kaon production @xcite which shows sensitivity @xcite only in a narrow beam energy interval just below threshold and above sufficient detection probability .",
    "it is clear that a large and rather complete data base on all the observable aspects of heavy ion reactions spanning large energy ranges in sufficiently dense steps is needed in order to be able to perform a stringent testing of the quality of a given transport code",
    ". only then can reliable and convincing conclusions on basic nuclear properties be derived . recently our collaboration , using the large acceptance apparatus fopi @xcite at the sis accelerator in darmstadt , germany ,",
    "has started a large effort to complement earlier , more specfic , works ( see some references given in subsequent sections ) by a systematic investigation encompassing 25 system - energies .    a first paper written in this spirit",
    "@xcite has offered a detailed overview of pion production .",
    "pions are in this energy regime by far the most copiously created particle .",
    "this study contained also information on the pion s longitudinal and transverse rapidity ditributions , as well as the two forms of azimuthally asymmetric pionic flow : directed and elliptic ( the definition will be recalled in the next section ) . in a second publication @xcite",
    "we have established a systematics for identified light charged particles in the most central collisions , studying the freeze - out chemistry , the degree of stopping and radial flow .",
    "the present work , finally , will present a systematics of directed and elliptic flow of these identified light particles in the same , sis , energy regime .    in this energy regime",
    "the passing time and the expansion time are comparable .",
    "while this offers a possibility to obtain a handle on such basic properties as the sound propagation velocity , it also has the consequence that rather complex collision geometries result , as shown in early hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the presence of relatively cold spectator matter at the time where the fireball is already expanding leads to cross talk between the various zones of very different local temperature .",
    "also , quantum effects such as fermi motion can not be ignored as the initial rapidity gaps between projectile and target are not extremely large .",
    "the resulting flow patterns are rather different from those observed @xcite for instance at the relativistic heavy ion collider rhic , although , formally , one is using the same parameterizations in terms of fourier expansion coefficients @xcite , such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 to be defined in section [ apparatus ] . to cope with the complexity of the flow in heavy ion collisions at sis we will present an overview covering dependences on incident energy , system size and centrality . as some of the observables are strongly dependent on centrality",
    ", we make an effort to define centrality in a way that allows a good match to centralities in simulations .",
    "it will become clear furthermore that a separation of flow contributions by the mass and charge of the ejectiles covering differentially a large part of a sharply defined phase space section both in transverse and longitudinal dimensions is needed to be able to draw unique conclusions from comparison with transport model simulations .",
    "we also devote some effort to a more recent extension of this physics to include the isospin degree of freedom @xcite by varying the system s isospin on one hand , and by measuring the flow differences of the isospin pair @xmath9h and @xmath9he on the other hand ( the @xmath10 pair was studied in @xcite ) .    in the sequel",
    "we start by briefly describing the fopi apparatus used in this work , the centrality selection and by defining some of the most used terms in section [ apparatus ] .",
    "an overview of the experimental data on directed flow , section [ v1 ] , and elliptic flow , section [ v2 ] , follows .",
    "an orientational confrontation of our data with transport model calculations will be given in section [ iqmd ] and we will terminate with a summary of the main conclusions .",
    "the experiments were performed at the heavy ion accelerator sis of gsi / darmstadt using the large acceptance fopi detector @xcite .",
    "the equipment and analysis methods in the present work largely correspond to those used in two of our earlier publications on pion emission @xcite and central collision observables @xcite in the same energy regime .",
    "we therefore confine ourselves to mentioning a few points that should be useful in making the present work reasonably self - contained .",
    "a total of 25 system - energies are analysed for this work ( energies per nucleon , @xmath11 , in gev are given in parentheses ) : @xmath1ca+@xmath1ca ( 0.4 , 0.,6 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 1.93 ) , @xmath2ni+@xmath2ni ( 0.15 , 0.25 ) , @xmath4xe+csi ( 0.15 , 0.25 ) , @xmath3ru+@xmath3ru ( 0.4 , 1.0 , 1.5 ) , @xmath3zr+@xmath3zr ( 0.4 , 1.5 ) , @xmath5au+@xmath5au ( 0.09 , 0.12 , 0.15 , 0.25 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.2 , 1.5 ) .    two setups were used for the low energy data ( @xmath12 gev ) and the high energy data . for the latter ,",
    "particle tracking and energy loss determination were done using two drift chambers , the cdc ( covering polar angles between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and the helitron ( @xmath15 ) , both located inside a superconducting solenoid operated at a magnetic field of 0.6 t .",
    "a set of scintillator arrays , zero degree detector @xmath16 , plastic wall @xmath17 , and barrel @xmath18 , allowed us to measure the time of flight and also the energy loss .    in the low energy run",
    "the helitron drift chamber was replaced by a set of gas ionization chambers ( parabola ) installed between the solenoid magnet ( enclosing the cdc ) and the plastic wall .",
    "more technical details can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . the combination of the two setups allowed us to identify pions and light charged particles ( lcp , i.e. isotopes of hydrogen and helium ) over a broad sector of phase space and to cover a large range of incident @xmath11 since there is approximately a factor of twenty between the lowest and the highest energy .",
    "as in our earlier work , collision centrality selection was obtained by binning distributions of either the detected charge particle multiplicity , _ mul _ , or the ratio of total transverse to longitudinal kinetic energies in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) system , _",
    "erat_. to avoid autocorrelations we have always excluded the particle of interest , for which we build up spectra , from the definition of _",
    "we estimate the impact parameter @xmath19 from the measured differential cross sections for the _ erat _ or the multiplicity distributions , using a geometrical sharp - cut approximation .",
    "more detailed discussions of the centrality selection methods used here can be found in refs .",
    "we characterize the centrality by the interval of the scaled impact parameter @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 , taking @xmath22  fm . this scaling is useful when comparing systems of different size . in this work we present data for four centrality bins : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the total number of registered events was typically @xmath27 and was triggered by a multiplicity filter .",
    "some minimum bias events were registered at a lower rate .",
    "figures [ uty - au1000c2z1a1 ] and [ vuty - au1000c2z1a1 ] give an idea of the yield and flow data covered by our apparatus for mass and charge identified lcp in the high energy run . in these plots",
    "the abscissa is the longitudinal ( beam axis ) rapidity @xmath28 in the @xmath29 reference system and the ordinate is the transverse ( spatial ) component @xmath30 of the four - velocity @xmath31 , given by @xmath32 .",
    "the 3-vector @xmath33 is the velocity in units of the light velocity and @xmath34 . throughout",
    "we use scaled units @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , the index p referring to the incident projectile in the @xmath29 . in these units",
    "the initial target - projectile rapidity gap always extends from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .    in fig .",
    "[ uty - au1000c2z1a1 ] the upper left panel shows for @xmath40 gev au on au collisions the proton yield distribution in the @xmath41 vs @xmath42 plane .",
    "the centrality is @xmath25 .",
    "two separate parts are visible : a predominantly forward @xmath43 part obtained with use of the carefully matched helitron and plastic wall and a mainly backward part using the matched cdc and barrel detector systems . for particle types separated by charge only there is an additional forward low - momentum sector available from the zero degree detector that is not plotted here , see ref . @xcite .",
    "while for the centrality selection the complete detector system is used , the flow analysis proceeds as follows ( as illustrated in the various panels of fig .",
    "[ uty - au1000c2z1a1 ] ) : to remove problem areas and edge effects visible in the upper left panel we apply rather restrictive sharp cuts as shown in the upper right panel .",
    "taking advantage of the symmetry of the system we then apply reflection symmetry on the @xmath44 axis , lower left panel and , finally , after some smoothing @xcite we fill some of the small gaps that remained by two - dimensional interpolation .",
    "the resulting two - dimensional distribution covers most of the phase space except for low transverse momenta .",
    "it is in this phase space that we are able then to determine the flow fields describing the azimuthal emission dependences shown in fig .",
    "[ vuty - au1000c2z1a1 ] .    owing to collective flow phenomena ,",
    "discovered experimentally in 1984  @xcite , it is possible to reconstruct the reaction plane event - by - event and hence to study azimuthal correlations relative to that plane .",
    "we have used the transverse momentum method  @xcite including all particles identified outside the midrapidity interval @xmath45 and excluding identified pions .",
    "pions , in this context , were only found to be important at the highest sis energy , but then contributed primarily to the reaction plane fluctuation .",
    "we use the well established parameterization @xcite    @xmath46    @xmath47\\ ] ]    @xmath48    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the azimuth with respect to the reaction plane and where angle brackets indicate averaging over events ( of a specific class ) .",
    "the fourier expansion is truncated , so that only three parameters , @xmath51 and @xmath8 , are used to describe the third dimension for fixed intervals of rapidity and transverse momentum .",
    "the adequacy of this truncation for the @xmath40 gev beam energy regime was already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite where this kind of fourier analysis of azimuhal distributions was probably first used .",
    "due to finite - number fluctuations the apparent reaction plane determined experimentally does not coincide event - wise with the true reaction plane , causing an underestimation of the deduced coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 which , however , can be corrected by dividing events into randomly chosen sub - events @xcite : as explained in more detail in @xcite , we have used the method of ollitrault @xcite to achieve this .",
    "the correction factors ( for the _ erat _ selection ) are listed in a table that can be found in the appendix .",
    "the finite resolution of the azimuth determination is also the prime reason why the measured higher fourier components turn out to be rather small .    alternatively to the three fourier coefficients",
    ", one can introduce the yields @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 in the four azimuthal quadrants , of which only three are independent ( on the average over many events ) due to symmetry requirements    @xmath56    more precisely , the flow axis is defined to be the median axis of quadrant @xmath52 which extends from @xmath57 to @xmath58 relative to the reaction plane located by definition at @xmath59 .",
    "thus , @xmath54 is the antiflow quadrant , while @xmath60 are the out - of - plane quadrants .",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xmath62 @xmath63 , @xmath52 , @xmath64    @xmath65 these relations show that @xmath7 is a dipole , while @xmath8 is a quadrupole strength .",
    "statistical ( count rate ) errors can be deduced with use of elementary algebra .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 , as well as @xmath8 , are found to be non - zero , is generally called flow in the literature and in particular the first fourier coefficient is taken to be a measure of directed flow , while the second fourier coefficient has been dubbed elliptic flow. in the sequel we will occasionally also use instead of @xmath66 ( number weighted flow ) the scaled transverse momentum ( @xmath67 ) weighted flow @xmath68",
    ". most of the time we will plot elliptic flow with an inverted sign ( i.e. @xmath69 ) for reasons that will become clear later ( see also the interpretation in terms of quadrupole strength given above ) .    in the language of particle - particle correlations , which avoids the explicit use of a reaction plane we are actually measuring the correlation of",
    "one chosen identified particle with all the other ( measured ) ejectiles .",
    "we are not trying here to separate so called non - flow from flow contributions or to establish two- , four- or more particle - particle correlations .",
    "we take the point of view that non - flow correlations ( such as resonance and cluster decays , which are not obviously disconnected from flow ) should be properly taken into account in a realistic microscopic transport simulation . on the other hand multi - particle correlations",
    "are to a large degree revealed in our flow data for multi - nucleon clusters .    in fig .",
    "[ vuty - au1000c2z1a1 ] we show the two - dimensional data deduced for the same reaction as in fig .",
    "[ uty - au1000c2z1a1 ] for directed flow ( left ) and elliptic flow ( right ) . the flat acceptance cut @xmath70 preserves the backward / forward ( a)symmetry of the apparent ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 . in the low energy data we can use such",
    "a flat cut only if we require @xmath71 for mass and charge identified particles since the helitron was not available yet for this part of our experimental campaigns .",
    "small symmetry violations present in the original data have been corrected out .",
    "the quadrant method is well suited for this @xcite .",
    "the corrections turn out to be critical for small isospin differences such as observed between @xmath9h and @xmath9he .",
    "we shall therefore come back to this later in sections [ v1iso ] and [ v2iso ] .",
    "a few general remarks on accuracy will be made here . in the sequel ,",
    "all our plotted data are given with errors that consist of a quadratic addition of systematic uncertainties and statistical fluctuations on the standard confidence level .",
    "if these errors are not visible they do not exceed the symbol sizes .",
    "generallly the _",
    "systematic _ errors of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are most important , but there are exceptions that can be seen when the errors tend to blow up for instance for high momenta , and for some of the ca+ca data which were obtained with lesser statistics . the estimates of systematic errors are based on observed forward - backward symmetry violations ( a specialty of fopi is that there is some overlap of measurements in the forward , resp .",
    "the backward hemisphers in the c.m . ) , violations of the zero crossing of @xmath7 at mid - rapidity , discontinuities when switching sub - detectors , deviations from the condition that the data for @xmath72 should be equal to the yield weighted sum of the separated isotopes ( which require for identification additional sub - detectors ) and incomplete isotopic separation ( primarily @xmath9h /@xmath9he , see also the discussion in section 3.5 ) .",
    "these errors may vary somewhat with the system - energy , typically we have for @xmath7 errors of 0.01 ( protons and deuterons ) , 0.015 ( mass 3 ) and 0.02 ( alpha s ) .",
    "for @xmath8 typical systematic errors are 0.005 ( protons ) , 0.007 ( deuterons ) and 0.1 ( mass @xmath73 ) .",
    "even under the contraints of symmetric heavy ion systems , the flow fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 have complex multidimensional dependences : @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath11 is the incident beam energy per mass unit , @xmath76 are the system mass and charge , @xmath77 is the ejectile composition . as a consequence",
    "a complete systematics encompasses an enormous amount of information .",
    "it is out of question to present all this information in one readable paper : the chosen one - dimensional cuts through the flow topology are necessarily restrictive and perhaps even somewhat arbitrary .",
    "nevertheless we believe that theoretical simulations that reproduce all of the presented results are likely to reproduce also the projections not shown here .",
    "additional information can be found in some of our earlier publications on nucleonic flow at sis energies @xcite .    in the sequel",
    "we will first treat the centrality @xmath78 dependence , then the ejectile mass @xmath79 and the system size @xmath80 dependence , the variation with incident energy @xmath81 and , finally , the isospin @xmath82 , @xmath83 effects .",
    "although direct comparisons with data obtained with different apparatus are exceedingly difficult owing to different apparatus biases and phase space cuts we will also present a few such comparisons . the next main section , on elliptic @xmath84 flow , will follow the same pattern .      in fig .",
    "[ v1-au400z1a1-grqcv-6 ] we show a sample of our @xmath85 data integrated over @xmath67 , but with data for @xmath86 cut off ( see section [ apparatus ] ) .",
    "only the forward hemisphere data are shown , the backward data are antisymmetric .",
    "it is known experimentally since some time @xcite that directed flow is maximal at some intermediate centrality : for @xmath87 it must however converge to zero for symmetry reasons , but does not do so in experiment because of finite @xmath20 resolution .",
    "nevertheless , below @xmath88 the figure shows that the variation with centrality is relatively modest as even the most central collisions ( @xmath23 or @xmath89 of the sharp radius cross section ) still are associated with a significant signal .",
    "the finite resolution effect is only part of the explanation , since the other aspects of flow , @xmath8 , see section [ v2 ] , and stopping @xcite are found to vary rather strongly with @xmath20 .",
    "one may conjecture that the geometrical decrease of asymmetry with decreasing @xmath20 is to some degree compensated by the increase of pressure expected from a more efficient stopping in more central collisions @xcite . as we shall see in section [ iqmd ] , sensitivity to the stiffness of",
    "the eos is highest for the most central @xmath20 interval .",
    "looking at the various panels of fig .",
    "[ v1-au400z1a1-grqcv-6 ] a striking feature is the large similarity of the data in the shown energy interval ( @xmath90 to @xmath91 gev ) which covers the high energy part of the present study .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the behaviour at lower energy ( see later ) .",
    "the use of scaled rapidities is essential to see this . in general , for proton flow , which is strongly smoothened by superimposed random motion , the data can be well described by two - parameter fits @xmath92 which are also plotted in the figure .",
    "these fits take care of smaller , more subtle , changes with incident energy that are visible on closer inspection of the @xmath85 data .    limiting ourselves to the information contained in the mid - rapidity slope parameter @xmath93 we obtain in a compact form data comparing the centrality @xmath78 dependence of multiplicity selected ( _ mul _ ) with _ erat _ selected data , fig .",
    "[ v1-au1500z1a1-grqcv - b ] .",
    "while the two types of selection widely seem equivalent for sufficiently large @xmath20 , it is remarkable that for @xmath94 the _ erat _ selections converge at all energies , except the lowest one ( @xmath95 gev , upper left panel ) to a smaller value of @xmath93 . rather than making a difference in @xmath20 resolution power responsible for this , it is tempting to conclude that very high multiplicity events are less central than events with maximal stopping _ erat_. the sorting according to _ mul _ is based on the idea that the participant / spectator ratio is increased with increasing multiplicity because the hotter participants emit more particles . however , for very central collisions , where little spectator matter is present , this is no longer a sufficient impact parameter selection criterion .",
    "there stronger stopping ( larger _ erat _ ) is correlated with higher achieved densities .",
    "this in turn leads in the expansion phase to more achieved cooling , hence more clusterization .",
    "this picture is supported by simulations with transport codes varying the achieved density by varying the stiffness of the eos , and by data varying with system size the achieved stopping @xcite .",
    "our observation also shows that sorting data according to maximal multiplicity @xcite does not in the present energy regime lead to the same stopping as sorting them according to _ erat _ first , and then picking out a fixed cross section sample with the highest stopping @xcite .",
    "the latter procedure is not an autocorrelation as maintained in @xcite , but a legitimate procedure searching for maximal ( not typical ) stopping and hence , presumably , maximal achieved density .",
    "the low transverse momentum suppression that we make for charge _ and _ mass identified particles is resulting from our apparatus limitations ( see section [ apparatus ] ) .",
    "as this limitation is not present in our charge ( but not mass ) separated data , we can get an idea of the effect caused by transverse momentum cuts by looking at charge one and two data in our study .",
    "we show an example in fig .",
    "[ ux - au800u0z1a0-grcv ] for au on au collisions at @xmath96 gev ( centrality @xmath25 ) both with and without the @xmath70 constraint . here",
    "we choose the transverse momentum weighted flow @xmath97 ( the corresponding mid - rapidity slope is dubbed @xmath98 ) for reasons that will become clear when we try ( subsection [ v1compa ] ) to compare with older data in the literature . as can be seen",
    ", flow is significantly larger when low transverse momenta are suppressed .",
    "the flow of particles that are only charge separated is difficult to interpret because it is a superposition from various isotopes with very different flow and hence is heavily influenced by the relative yields of these isotopes ( see section [ iqmd ] , fig .",
    "[ v1-au400z1a0-grcv - c2 ] ) .",
    "therefore in the next subsection we take a look at the flow of individual isotopes .",
    "we show the ejectile mass dependence of directed flow for centrality @xmath25 as a function of rapidity @xmath99 ( integrated starting from @xmath71 for the low energy runs up to @xmath100 gev and @xmath70 for the higher beam energies ) in figs .",

    "the more subtle differences between @xmath9h and @xmath9he will be discussed later .",
    "the data span the whole energy range measured for the au on au system ( @xmath102 gev to @xmath91 gev ) and hence contains a rather detailed information that represents a challenge for any theoretical attempts to reproduce all of them .",
    "one observes a gradual evolution of the shapes of the curves with the mass of the ejectiles : the variation with either @xmath99 or @xmath67 is seen to be more pronounced as the mass is increased .",
    "the general increase of flow with mass is not new of course @xcite and is expected even in pure hydrodynamics treatments @xcite where it is explained qualitatively in terms of random ( thermal ) motion , which is in velocity space largest for the lightest particles , on top of a common flow .",
    "this interpretation clearly does not then lead to ( nucleon ) number scaling which has been claimed to be proof of deconfinement of the constituents ( constituent quarks at rhic energies ) @xcite ) .",
    "it is obvious that the curves for the different masses ( a=1 to 4 ) are not equidistant along the ordinate and the different shapes as both the function of rapidity and transverse momentum ( watch the location of the maxima ) show that a perfect number scaling , even with transverse kinetic energy instead of @xmath67 , would not emerge .",
    "we shall see later that the same conclusion also holds for elliptic flow .",
    "of course due to cuts in the @xmath67 ( @xmath99 dependence ) and in @xmath99 ( @xmath67 dependence ) a global scaling , if present , is not tested here .",
    "qualitatively , we expect the purely hydrodynamic minded view to be an oversimplification of reality since the system is not governed by ideal hydrodynamics , see namely the incomplete stopping and the stopping hierarchy of clusters observed in @xcite .    the smooth curves plotted in figs .",
    "[ v1ut - au90c2-jjscv - a4 ] and [ v1ut - au400c2-grqcv-6 ] are just polynomial fits with maximally three parameters such as @xmath103 .",

    "however , we find that the proton @xmath105 data at the lowest incident beam energies ( fig .",
    "[ v1ut - au90c2-jjscv - a4 ] ) seem to have an additional puzzling structure .",
    "one tentative explanation is that the bump is caused by protons emitted from heavier clusters , the proton then carrying a fraction of the flow of their parents .",
    "this would mean that late decays ( evaporation ) must be included in simulation codes .",
    "this could be of some non - academic importance for efforts to deduce isospin dependences of the nuclear eos from neutron - proton difference flows @xcite as it is the slow particles that are generally found to be sensitive to mean fields .",
    "evaporation could also have a sizeable influence on the @xmath106 data for the lower beam energies .",
    "system size dependences of directed flow were first observed by the plastic ball group @xcite . a sample of our present data is shown in figs .",

    "for identified protons and deuterons both the rapidity dependences and the transverse momentum dependences are addressed .",

    "+ 3 ) as before , we note the absence of simple - minded ( nucleon ) number scaling in the sis energy regime for any system size . looking at the data for many incident energies , we find ratios of @xmath108 for deuteron to proton flow . since a switch to ( transverse )",
    "kinetic energies for the abscissa would not modify the ordinates ( @xmath7 ) , this conclusion holds also for the flow scaling as proposed by the rhic community ( which however was for elliptic flow , see later , section [ v2 ] ) .",

    "another gratifying result is that we do not have any difficulty reproducing both directed and elliptic flow with the same assumptions . at the highest energy studied here , we were also able to reproduce well the radial flow and the stopping for the various hydrogen isotopes .",
    "we note that our version of iqmd did not assume any in - medium modifications of the microscopic cross sections other than pauli blocking .",
    "no _ ad hoc _ modification to achieve agreement with our data was done .    more specifically ,",
    "for elliptic flow , @xmath138 , we were able to check the influence of the eos on the shape of the function in a large rapidity range , not just at mid - rapidity .",
    "this allowed us to state that the differences of @xmath138 between @xmath9h and @xmath9he are consistent _ over the complete rapidity gap _ with a more repulsive force acting on the neutron richer cluster .",
    "our directed flow data on the mass three clusters are also consistent with this conclusion .",
    "still , more work needs to be done . on the experimental side",
    "a confirmation of the isospin effect will be helpful .",
    "the future international facility fair at gsi , darmstadt should allow to access higher nuclear densities than has been possible here",
    ". theoretically it would be desirable to reproduce the cluster yields without loosing the good performance on flow observables .",
    "also , using internally consistent theories such as @xcite , a further fine tuning of our stopping data is needed .",
    "more subtle effects , to be further investigated , are possible correlations of flow to clusterization visible in the momentum dependences of single nucleon flow and , also , the experimental evidence of quantum effects on flow , such as fermi motion subsisting at freeze - out time .",
    "fermi motion tends to get lost in a semiclassical transport calculation .",
    "such deficiency leads to overestimation of the predicted flow .",
    "all of this is an ambitious task beyond the scope of the present experimental work .",
    "hopefully there will be convergence of the various existing transport codes in the future .",
    "an exciting prospect is a possible joining up of information from heavy ion data with astrophysical observations on neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the correction factors @xcite given in the table are defined by + @xmath216 and @xmath217 + where the primed quantities are the uncorrected flow parameters and the index @xmath218 distinguishes the various _ erat _ selected centralities , in order + @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .       this work has been supported by the german bmbf , contract 06hd154 , by the dfg ( project 446-kor-113/76 ) and dfg(project 436pol 113/121/0 - 1 ) , by the polish ministry of science and higher education under grant no dfg /34/2007/ , the daad ( ppp d /03/44611 ) and the in2p3/gsi agreement 97/29 .",
