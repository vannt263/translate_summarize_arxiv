    "over the past several years we have undertaken a major survey of m31 , which has revealed a wealth of unexpected substructure @xcite , the most prominent being a giant stream of stars near the minor axis @xcite .",
    "as part of this study of m31 , we have searched for globular clusters ( gcs ) in a large part of the halo .",
    "gc systems have been shown to be valuable tools for the study of the evolution of their host galaxies , acting as chemical and dynamical probes @xcite .",
    "specifically , most gcs are believed to be old objects , and thus provide clues to the earliest epochs of galaxy formation history .",
    "the three clusters presented here were discovered during this search for classical gcs , whose results are more fully documented in another paper ( huxor et al . in prep ) . while undertaking aperture photometry of one of the gcs found , a diffuse cluster was serendipitously discovered nearby in the same field ( cluster 1 , hereafter c1 , in figure [ fi : clusters ] ) .",
    "the object was not classed as a single object by the int - wfs ( isaac newton telescope wide field survey ) pipeline @xcite , and hence , had been missed by the semi - automated techniques that we employed in the main gc survey .",
    "it is very distinctive in being significantly more extended than typical gcs : aperture photometry giving a half - light radius ( @xmath2 ) of 35 pc , assuming a distance to m31 of @xmath0780 kpc @xcite .",
    "we were therefore motivated to undertake a visual survey of all the int - wfs images for the m31 region , which resulted in the discovery of two further objects with similar properties .",
    "in this paper we present the three clusters , which are unlike any found around the milky way , m31 or indeed elsewhere to date , in that although many mw gcs have half - light radii approaching 30 pc , they are faint . these new clusters , however , are of average gc lumonosity .",
    "the fields visually investigated include the whole int - wfs m31 survey , an area far into the halo , and an additional region south along the andromeda stream , and towards m33 , making a total area of more than 40 square degrees ( see figure [ fi : layout ] ) .",
    "the survey consists of v and gunn i band images with exposures of between 800 - 1000 seconds , reaching ( average 5 @xmath3 ) limiting magnitudes of i = 23.5 and v = 24.5 , and taken in average seeing of 1.2 arcsec .",
    "these images were processed by the int wfs pipeline provided by the cambridge astronomical survey unit , which includes tools for astrometry , photometry and object description and classification @xcite .",
    "the location of the clusters ( star icons ) , in relation to m31 is shown in figure [ fi : layout ] , while postage stamp images ( 1 arcmin @xmath4 1 arcmin ) of the clusters are shown in figure [ fi : clusters ] .",
    "the clusters appear , in projection , to cover a range of environments , from the far halo ( c2 ) , to near the disk ( c3 ; though we note that if c3 is a disk object , it lies at a very large radius of 27 kpc ) .",
    "the positions of the three extended globular clusters were cross - checked against existing catalogues starting with the gc lists of barmby ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/@xmath0pbarmby/m31gc.html ; @xcite ) and the newly published revised bologna catalog ( http://www.bo.astro.it/m31/ ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , other databases such as vizier @xcite and ned ( http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html ) were consulted for any prior identifications .",
    "c1 , the richest cluster , has previously been catalogued from a large scale survey as a background low surface brightness galaxy , object n04 - 1 of @xcite .",
    "however , the int - wfs survey image clearly shows it to be a resolved star cluster .",
    "cmds of the clusters ( see figures [ fi : cmd1 ] , [ fi : cmd2 ] and [ fi : cmd3 ] ) were made from the int - wfs images by performing daophot ( iraf implementation ) profile - fitting photometry on the regions of the images containing the clusters .",
    "this level of crowding is an ideal application of profile - fitting photometry , and the large number of bright stars on the images allows a good psf model to be constructed in each case .",
    "the resulting cmds are fully consistent with metal - poor , old stellar populations at the distance of m31 .",
    "there is no evidence for a population of young main sequence stars at these locations .",
    "the integrated @xmath5 colours are also consistent with low metallicity ( @xcite ) if indeed they are an old population .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the distinction between different types of stellar cluster is becoming increasingly complex , with even the boundary between open and globular clusters sometimes being blurred .",
    "borderline objects have been identified , such as bh 176 @xcite which could be a true globular cluster or a very old open cluster .",
    "the situation is complicated further by @xmath6 cen , which although long classified as a gc , has many unusual features , such as a wide metallicity spread of its component stars@xcite , a characteristic shared by the bright m31 globular cluster g1 @xcite .     and representing a range of metallicities , from left to right : [ fe / h]=-2.17 ( m15 ) ; -1.91 ( ngc 6397 ) ; -1.58 ( m2 ) ; -1.29 ( ngc 1851 ) and @xmath7 ( 47 tuc )",
    ". the rgb locus of the c1 is clearly delineated , and consistent with an old , metal - poor population at the distance of m31.,width=302 ]            more recently , new classes of object have been identified which begin to fill in the gap in the parameter space between classical gcs and dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite measured the properties of ultra - compact objects ( ucos ) [ or ultra - compact dwarfs - ucds ] in the fornax cluster , which are as bright as dwarf ellipticals but very much more compact . @xcite",
    "describe a population of very massive globular clusters in ngc 5128 , whose properties overlap with those of nucleated dwarfs and ucds . at the fainter end of the luminosity scale @xcite",
    "described a new class of star cluster found in hst studies of two lenticular galaxies , ngc 1023 and ngc 3384 , lying at distances of @xmath0 10 mpc .",
    "these clusters occupy a region of parameter space having an absolute v magnitude fainter than @xmath8 , a half - light radius greater than 715 pc , and have been christened  faint fuzzies \" ( ffs ) .",
    "the relationship between all these object types , and mw and m31 dsph galaxies is illustrated in figure [ fi : plot ] .",
    "the new extended clusters are shown ( solid circles ) , along with mw gcs from @xcite , dsphs associated with the mw ( @xcite ) , the dsphs associated with m31 ( @xcite and @xcite ) , and g1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the region that would be occupied by the ffs is to to the right of , and above , the dotted lines on the plot ( although they are distinguished from the more diffuse mw gcs in terms of their numbers , higher metallicities and disky kinematics ) .    in terms of morphology and luminosity the new extended clusters are rather more extended and more luminous the ffs ( although the magnitudes of the latter may well be underestimates by several tenths of a magnitude due to the aperture corrections chosen for photometry ) .",
    "furthermore , brodie and larsen s ffs are moderately metal rich [ fe / h]@xmath0 -0.6 , and consequently have red integrated colours , @xmath5 of @xmath9 .",
    "looking more broadly at figure [ fi : plot ] we see a variety of objects in the region between classical gcs and dsphs .",
    "a number of origins have been proposed to explain the intermediate forms .",
    "@xcite has proposed that ngc 2419 , the unusual mw gc , with a half - light radius of @xmath1 19 pc may have been accreted from a putative  ancient sagittarius galaxy \" , along with some of the fainter gcs : terzan 7 , arp 2 , terzan 8 ( which are part of the main body of sgr ) and pal15 .",
    "one might therefore speculate that these new m31 objects formed in a dwarf galaxy , which may have since merged with m31 .",
    "for similar reasons , @xcite have also suggested that their ffs may have formed in dwarfs before joining the host galaxies , although they also consider an alternative theory in which ffs form preferentially in lenticular galaxies with well - developed disks .",
    "however , we should point out that by no means are all dwarf galaxy gcs unusually extended .",
    "other possible scenarios to form extended clusters involve either stripping of dwarfs to form smaller systems , or the merger of star clusters to form larger systems .",
    "for example , both g1 and @xmath6 cen gcs are unique , with suggestions that they are the cores of stripped dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite speculate that due to the presence of extra - tidal light , that some of their massive gcs in ngc 5128 may be the nuclei of stripped dwarfs .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite suggest that the nuclei of dwarf nucleated galaxies survive encounters with a giant galaxy , and they propose that such a scenario may explain the large number of gcs in many galaxies . depending on the characteristics of the progenitor dwarf , and of the encounter orbit",
    ", a range of remnant clusters can be produced . in their models ,",
    "the surviving clusters are more massive and have larger tidal radii than globular clusters ( or our new extended clusters ) .",
    "however , they suggest that more concentrated nuclei and closer encounters with the centre of the giant galaxy might produce more compact clusters , such as gcs .",
    "indeed , it has been proposed that m54 is the nucleus of the sagittarius dwarf ( @xcite , but see @xcite for a contrary view ) .",
    "such a scenario has important implications .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that if , as postulated , all galaxies have central black holes , such stripped objects should have black holes at their cores , and @xcite report to have found evidence , albeit controversial , for such a black hole in g1 .",
    "it is also believed that gcs , unlike dsphs , do not possess a dark matter halo , leaving open the question of the dark matter content for any intermediate forms , such as those listed above .",
    "however , @xcite found that any progenitor dwarf would have to have had its dm halo stripped to form a g1-like cluster .",
    "it has been argued that g1 and @xmath6 cen can be better explained as the product of merger events .",
    "for example , @xcite propose a model for g1 involving merger of two smaller gcs ( and argue that there is no need to invoke a central bh ) .",
    "@xcite has suggested that @xmath6 cen could be the product of a merger of  super star clusters \" , themselves created in a starburst event triggered by the accretion of a dwarf satellite , which derives its diverse stellar population by capturing old field stars from the dwarf .",
    "furthermore , since the progenitor dwarf itself may have been the product of merging , it would retain traces of these past merging events .",
    "@xcite find that their results are consistent with both stripping and the merged stellar super - clusters scenarios for ucos .",
    "does any of this help in understanding our new objects ?",
    "the two mechanisms discussed above by which extended clusters may be produced from other objects ( by nurture , as it were ) , involve either merging of massive star clusters or stripping of dsphs .",
    "@xcite , using n - body simulations , find that they can form ff - like objects from the merger of the  super star clusters \" noted above , such as might have their origins in galaxy - galaxy interaction .",
    "formation in such a single interaction event might explain why a population of extended clusters is found in m31 but not in the mw . in the fellhauer and kroupa picture the ff clusters are subsequently tidally truncated to obtain the observed cluster sizes , which may not be relevant given the large galactocentric radii of the m31 clusters . on the other hand , @xcite have noted that only two galactic gcs lie above the equation log @xmath10 on the plot in figure [ fi : plot ] , @xmath6 cen and ngc 2419 .",
    "they prefer the stripped dwarf model for these two objects and suggest that clusters above the line can be best explained by such stripping , such as that modelled in @xcite .",
    "the question naturally arises as to what distance from m31 could clusters such as ours survive against tidal disruption , which obviously relates to the issue of how long - lived such clusters can be .",
    "if we take a typical gc mass - to - light ratio of 2 , the absolute magnitude values in table 1 give masses for the clusters of @xmath11 .",
    "employing a logarithmic halo model and assuming a circular velocity of 250 km  s@xmath12 , we find a galactocentric distance of @xmath13 kpc is required to produce the tidal radii observed .",
    "this is consistent with the radii at which we observe our clusters , and also the fact that none have been found at smaller distances .",
    "the above assumes a @xmath14 typical for gcs , but it is also possible , particularly if the new clusters are stripped dwarfs , that they could have some dark matter component . in this regard",
    "it is interesting that @xcite suggest that their object may be an extreme dwarf galaxy due to its position on the @xmath15/@xmath2 plot ( their figure 10 ) , an argument which might also be applied to our new clusters .",
    "the fact that the similarly extended but much fainter willman object has been discovered in the mw , but no objects similar to our m31 clusters strongly indicates that no such population exists in our galaxy .",
    "this suggests that there might be important differences between the formation and evolution of m31 , in comparison with the mw , to allow for this new cluster population for form and survive .",
    "this could be established by searching for similar clusters in more distant galaxies covering a range in hubble type and environment , but here it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish such clusters from background galaxies .",
    "we have presented three newly discovered globular - like ( in terms of luminosity and colour ) clusters in the halo of m31 with unusually large half - light radii , of around 30 pc ( compared to typical gc values between 1 and 7 pc ) .",
    "these objects start to fill the gap in parameter space between ( negligible dark matter ) classical gcs and ( dark matter dominated ) dwarf spheroidals .",
    "this is a region which in recent times has also been encroached by a variety of new objects , such as the ucos in fornax and massive gcs in ngc 5128 .",
    "our clusters are lower luminosity systems than these , and are rather brighter and more extended than the so - called faint fuzzy clusters ( ffs ) , found by @xcite in two lenticular galaxies , and also bluer indicating a lower metallicity .",
    "the extended m31 clusters have no known analogues in the milky way , where such clusters would certainly have been discovered if they existed , unless hidden by the plane of the galaxy .",
    "this suggests that they could hold important clues to the differing formation histories of these galaxies .",
    "if these clusters were not born with their present morphology then one may speculate that they are the stripped cores of cannibalised dwarf spheroidal galaxies , or the products of cluster mergers perhaps themselves created in a previous interaction of a gas - rich companion with m31 .",
    "unlike the ucos and faint fuzzies , these objects are comparatively nearby in m31 , and hence ( like g1 ) open to detailed , resolved , investigation by both hst and ground - based instruments . further , ongoing , observations will reveal more about the nature of these intriguing objects : metallicity , hb morphology , systemic and internal kinematics .",
    "ah is funded by a particle physics and astronomy research council ( pparc ) studentship .",
    "the research of amnf has been supported by a marie curie fellowship of the european community under contract number hpmf - ct-2002 - 01758 .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ."
