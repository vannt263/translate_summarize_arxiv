    "modern particle physics has reached a level of experimental accuracy in the percent range , and some present and future precision experiments require theoretical uncertainties to be at the permille level .",
    "this need for precise theory predictions has pushed forward the frontier for calculations of higher orders in perturbation theory considerably in recent years .",
    "the calculation of higher order corrections relies to a large extent on tree or loop level feynman diagrams , where the unobserved degrees of freedom , respectively the loop momenta , have to be integrated out .",
    "it is well known that these integrations become increasingly difficult at higher orders , as the dimensionality of the integration parameter space and/or the number of scales involved is growing . the intricacy is closely related to the fact that these integrals in general contain ultraviolet ( uv ) or infrared ( ir ) divergences which need to be renormalised respectively factorised , because they hinder an immediate numerical evaluation of complicated expressions .",
    "the subtraction of these singularities becomes more and more cumbersome at higher orders , due to the fact that the divergences will be entangled in an increasingly complicated way .    for ultraviolet divergences , bogoliubov , parasiuk , hepp and zimmermann  @xcite , established a subtraction scheme valid to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , the original idea of sector decomposition goes back to the proof of the bphz theorem by hepp  @xcite , who used a decomposition of integration parameter space into certain sectors in order to disentangle overlapping ultraviolet singularities .    concerning infrared divergences ,",
    "the finiteness of sufficiently inclusive observables is guaranteed by the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem  @xcite , but in most practical applications , more exclusive information about the final state is required , such that a subtraction scheme for ir divergences has to be established .",
    "a constructive scheme to do so to all orders in perturbation theory has not been formulated in full generality yet , at least in what concerns soft _ and collinear _ divergences .",
    "however , the sector decomposition algorithm as outlined below offers a constructive method to isolate these divergences from feynman parameter integrals , which in principle is valid to all orders in perturbation theory .    for the subtraction of ( soft ) ir divergences , several approaches have been suggested .",
    "early ones , which are based already on the subdivision of the integration parameter space into different sectors where the parameters go to zero in an ordered way , can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "these sectors , associated with certain sets of one - particle irreducible subgraphs , are more advanced than the sectors needed in the uv case , and provide a resolution of the singularities without the need for an iterative procedure for diagrams with off - shell external momenta .",
    "further , the so - called @xmath0-operation  @xcite has been developed , which removes not only uv - divergences but also soft ir divergences by a procedure similar to the @xmath1-operation  @xcite in the uv case . for a review of these methods , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "later , the decomposition into sectors has been employed to extract logarithmic mass singularities from massive multi - scale integrals in the high energy limit at two loops  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the concept of sector decomposition has been elaborated to a general algorithm in the context of dimensional regularisation , allowing to isolate ultraviolet as well as infrared singularities from parameter integrals in an automated way  @xcite",
    ". the algorithm also has been implemented in a public code available from  @xcite .    at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in perturbation theory , the use of dimensional regularisation  @xcite and the universal infrared structure of gauge theories involving massless particles , like qed and qcd , allowed to establish a framework to isolate ir singularities analytically , leading to a multitude of phenomenological predictions .",
    "more recently , an increasing number of results at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) has also become available , and quite a number of them made use of the sector decomposition technique to isolate infrared singularities or to check analytical results  @xcite .    as most problems encountered in the calculation of perturbative higher order corrections can be reduced to the evaluation of multi - dimensional parameter integrals ,",
    "the applicability of sector decomposition is quite universal .",
    "the first application of the algorithm presented in @xcite was the numerical evaluation of massless two - loop box diagrams at certain euclidean points . pioneering the analytic calculation of two - loop box diagrams ,",
    "the planar topology with light - like external legs has been calculated by v.a .",
    "smirnov  @xcite , the non - planar one by j.b.tausk  @xcite , where the numerical results obtained by sector decomposition served as an important check of the analytical calculation . for massless two - loop box diagrams with one off - shell leg , the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite were predictions which played a major role to validate the subsequent analytical calculations  @xcite , finally allowing the calculation of the full two - loop qcd matrix element for @xmath2 jets  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , sector decomposition was used to check a considerable number of analytical results for two - loop  @xcite , three - loop  @xcite and four - loop  @xcite diagrams .",
    "sector decomposition also has been combined with other methods for an efficient numerical calculation of one - loop multi - leg amplitudes , first on a diagrammatic level in refs .",
    "@xcite , later for whole amplitudes in refs .",
    "the latter approach contains a combination of sector decomposition and contour deformation  @xcite , which allows to integrate the feynman parameter representation of an amplitude numerically in the physical region .",
    "it also contains the application of sector decomposition to phase space integrals , which will be discussed below .",
    "similar ideas , i.e. the combination of sector decomposition and contour deformation , are employed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the numerical evaluation of multi - loop feynman diagrams with infrared and threshold singularities .",
    "@xcite describes the implementation of an algorithm based on sector decomposition to extract the @xmath3 poles as well as the large logarithms of type @xmath4 in the high - energy limit , allowing to obtain the next - to - leading logarithmic electroweak corrections of multi - loop diagrams .    despite its success in practical applications , until very recently there was no formal proof that a strategy for the iterated sector decomposition can always be found such that the iteration is guaranteed to stop .",
    "this gap has been filled in ref .",
    "@xcite , by mapping the problem to hironaka s polyhedra game  @xcite .",
    "the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite subsequently have been used to prove that the coefficients of the laurent series representing feynman integrals in the euclidean region with rational values for all invariants are a special class of numbers known by mathematicians as periods  @xcite .    also on a more formal level , it is outlined in @xcite that sector decomposition can be used to automate the renormalisation of quantum field theories , by mapping to the so - called henge decomposition  @xcite , which served to provide a simple proof of the bphz theorem  @xcite .",
    "this mapping also allowed to establish a direct correspondence between overlapping divergences in feynman parameter space and in momentum space  @xcite . in this context",
    ", one should also mention the formulation of renormalisation using hopf algebras  @xcite , which provide a framework to describe the disentanglement of divergent subgraphs of feynman diagrams .",
    "after the results for various two - loop box diagrams had become available , the bottleneck to make progress in the calculation of differential nnlo cross sections for @xmath5 or @xmath6 processes was the complicated infrared singularity structure of phase space integrals over matrix elements for the real radiation of ( doubly ) unresolved massless particles .",
    "as these phase space integrals can be written as dimensionally regularised parameter integrals , sector decomposition can serve to factorise entangled singularity structures in the case of real radiation as well .",
    "this idea has first been presented in  @xcite and subsequently has been applied to calculate all master four - particle phase space integrals where up to two particles in the final state can become soft and/or collinear  @xcite . shortly after , this approach has been extended to be applicable to exclusive final states as well by expressing the functions produced by sector decomposition in terms of distributions  @xcite . a rapid development  @xcite lead to the calculation of @xmath7jets at @xmath8  @xcite . further elaboration on this approach resulted in the first fully differential program to calculate an nnlo cross section  @xcite and has lead to differential nnlo results for a number of processes meanwhile  @xcite .",

    "as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : param_rep ] ) , the difference between scalar and tensor integrals is , once the lorentz structure is extracted , given by the fact that there are polynomials of feynman parameters in the numerator .",
    "these polynomials can simply be included into the sector decomposition procedure , thus treating tensor integrals directly without reduction to scalar integrals .",
    "however , there is yet another possibility : any tensor integral can be expressed in terms of scalar integrals in shifted dimensions , with some of the propagator powers different from unity , as has been shown in  @xcite .",
    "as our propagators can have arbitrary powers @xmath22 , and the dimension @xmath20 is a free parameter , this is a viable alternative .      for less trivial examples than the one given in section [ sec : basics ]",
    ", the singularities will not be factorised already after a single step of sector decomposition .",
    "an algorithm how to iterate this procedure is described below .",
    "our starting point is a function of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : param_rep ] ) .",
    "as the basic algorithm is the same for tensor integrals , we will consider @xmath67 here for ease of notation , i.e. @xmath68      we split the integration domain into @xmath18 parts and eliminate the @xmath69distribution in such a way that the remaining integrations are from 0 to 1 . to this end",
    "we decompose the integration range into @xmath18 sectors , where in each sector @xmath70 , @xmath71 is largest ( note that the remaining @xmath72 are not further ordered ) : @xmath73 the @xmath74-function is defined as @xmath75 the integral is now split into @xmath18 domains corresponding to @xmath18 integrals @xmath76 from which we extract a common factor : @xmath77 . in the integrals @xmath76 we substitute @xmath78 and then integrate out @xmath71 using the @xmath69distribution .",
    "as @xmath79 are homogeneous of degree @xmath21,@xmath57 , respectively , and @xmath71 factorises completely , we have @xmath80 and @xmath81 and thus , using @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath83 note that the singular behaviour leading to @xmath84poles still comes from regions where a set of parameters @xmath85 goes to zero .",
    "this feature would be lost if the @xmath69distribution was integrated out in a different way , since this would produce poles at upper limits of the parameter integral as well .",
    "the @xmath18 generated sectors will be called _ primary _ sectors in the following .      starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : primary_sectors ] ) we repeat the following steps until a complete separation of overlapping regions is achieved .",
    "ii.1 : : :    determine a minimal set of parameters , say    @xmath86 , such that    @xmath87 , respectively @xmath88 ,    vanish if the parameters of @xmath89 are set to zero .",
    "@xmath89 is in general not unique , and there is no    general prescription which defines what set to choose in order to    achieve a _",
    "minimal _ number of iterations .",
    "strategies to choose    @xmath89 such that the algorithm is guaranteed to stop    are given in  @xcite .",
    "using these strategies however in general leads    to a larger number of iterations than heuristic strategies to avoid    infinite loops , described in more detail below .",
    "ii.2 : : :    decompose the corresponding @xmath90-cube into @xmath90    _ subsectors _ by decomposing unity according to    @xmath91 ii.3 : : :    remap the variables to the unit hypercube in each new subsector by the    substitution @xmath92    this gives a jacobian factor of @xmath93 . by    construction @xmath94 factorises from at least one    of the functions @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the resulting subsector integrals have the general form    @xmath95    for each subsector the above steps have to be repeated as long as a set @xmath89 can be found such that one of the functions @xmath96 or @xmath97 vanishes if the elements of @xmath89 are set to zero .",
    "this way new subsectors are created in each subsector of the previous iteration , resulting in a tree - like structure after a certain number of iterations .",
    "the iteration stops if the functions @xmath98 or @xmath99 contain a constant term , i.e. if they are of the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are polynomials in the variables @xmath103 ( without a constant term ) , and @xmath104 are kinematic invariants defined by the cuts of the diagram as explained above , or ( minus ) internal masses .",
    "thus , after a certain number of iterations , each integral @xmath76 is split into a certain number , say @xmath105 , of subsector integrals .",
    "we can replace the multi - index @xmath106 stemming from the subsector decomposition by a single index which just counts the number of generated subsectors .",
    "the subsector integrals are exactly of the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : subsec_form ] ) , with the difference that the index @xmath107 now runs from 1 to @xmath105 , the total number of produced subsectors in each primary sector .",
    "evidently the singular behaviour of the integrand now can be read off directly from the exponents @xmath108 , @xmath109 for a given subsector integral .",
    "as the singular behaviour is manifestly non - overlapping now , it is straightforward to define subtractions .",
    "the subtraction of the poles can be done implicitly by expanding the singular factors into distributions , or explicitly by direct integration over the singular factors . in any case",
    ", the following procedure has to be worked through for each variable @xmath110 and each subsector integrand :    * let us consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : subsec_form ] ) for a particular @xmath103 , i.e. let us focus on @xmath111 where @xmath112 in a particular subsector .",
    "if @xmath113 , the integration does not lead to an @xmath114pole . in this case",
    "no subtraction is needed and one can go to the next variable @xmath115 .",
    "if @xmath116 , one expands @xmath117 into a taylor series around @xmath118 : @xmath119 * now the pole part can be extracted easily , and one obtains @xmath120 by construction , the integral containing the remainder term @xmath121 does not produce poles in @xmath114 upon @xmath103-integration anymore . for @xmath122 , which is the generic case for renormalisable theories ( logarithmic divergence ) ,",
    "this simply amounts to @xmath123 which is equivalent to applying the  plus prescription \"  @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ plusdist ] ) ) , except that the integrations over the singular factors have been carried out explicitly .",
    "since , as long as @xmath124 , the expression ( [ tjsubtr ] ) still contains an overall factor @xmath125 , it is of the same form as ( [ eqsub_step1 ] ) for @xmath126 and the same steps as above can be applied .",
    "after @xmath127 steps all poles are extracted , such that the resulting expression can be expanded in @xmath114 .",
    "this defines a laurent series in @xmath114 with coefficients @xmath128 for each of the @xmath129 subsector integrals @xmath130 .",
    "since each loop can contribute at most one soft and collinear @xmath131 term , the highest possible infrared pole of an @xmath132loop graph is @xmath133 . expanding to order @xmath134",
    ", one has @xmath135 following the steps outlined above one has generated a regular integral representation of the coefficients @xmath128 , consisting of @xmath136dimensional finite integrals over parameters @xmath103 .",
    "we recall that @xmath49 was non - negative in the euclidean region where all invariants are negative ( see eqs .",

    ", it is also possible to do at least part of these parameter integrals analytically , but in most applications such an analytical approach reaches its limits very quickly .",
    "as mentioned already , the choice of the set @xmath86 which makes @xmath48 respectively @xmath49 vanish for @xmath137 is in general not unique .",
    "the structure of the function @xmath48 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq0def ] ) ) is such that its decomposition will always terminate after @xmath21 iterations for an @xmath21-loop integral .",
    "for the function @xmath49 , the structure depends on the masses and kinematic invariants involved .",
    "although one could follow one of the mathematical strategies given in @xcite to ensure the iteration terminates , this is not the most efficient method for practical purposes , as these strategies typically generate a large number of subsectors .",
    "another possibility , adopted in  @xcite , is to choose the set @xmath89 randomly , such that eventually a set will be selected which does not lead to infinite recursion .",
    "however , it is more efficient to use some heuristic rules which , in all applications to multi - loop diagrams considered so far by the author , lead to a terminating decomposition procedure .",
    "let us first illustrate the problem by a simple example : consider the function f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=x_1 ^ 2+x_2 ^ 2 x_3 , and suppose we choose @xmath138 .",
    "the replacement @xmath139 in the subsector associated with @xmath140 leads to @xmath141 .",
    "choosing now @xmath142 and substituting @xmath143 in the corresponding subsector brings us back to the original functional form , so we generate an infinite recursion for the above choices of @xmath89 . in this simple example we can see immediately that the choice @xmath144 does not lead to this problem .    for multi - loop integrals , we can use the following facts as a guideline to choose convenient sets @xmath89 : we first note that an infinite recursion does not occur for functions which are linear in each variable .",
    "the function @xmath49 , before the iterated decompositions , is a polynomial of maximal degree two in each individual feynman parameter , where quadratic parameters only occur if massive propagators are present , due to the term @xmath145 contained in @xmath49 ( see eq.([eq0def ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , a simple extra rule for diagrams with internal masses can be added to the procedure : before entering the iteration , determine the set @xmath146 of labels belonging to massive propagators and use this set for a first sector decomposition ( even if it does not lead to @xmath65 upon setting the elements of @xmath146 to zero ) .",
    "this produces a form where in each subsector , one of the quadratic powers is reduced by one , such that self - similarity to the original form can not be generated anymore .",
    "in the course of the iterations , quadratic or higher powers will be generated unavoidably , such that a form which may lead to infinite recursion can occur at some point . in this case",
    "it has proven useful to choose , if existent , a set @xmath89 containing the maximal number of variables occurring with the _ same _ power .",

    "however , minimising the number of decompositions by convenient parametrisations is vital to limit the size of the expressions produced by iterated sector decomposition .",
    "the main differences to loop integrals in the sector decomposition procedure for phase space integrals are again summarised in table  [ table : diffs ] .",
    "to explain the concept , we go back to the example of the previous section , the massless @xmath159 phase space , and topologies containing @xmath160 or @xmath161 in the denominator . in order to achieve a convenient parametrisation , we first multiply eq .",
    "( [ fi4 ] ) by @xmath162 and eliminate @xmath163 using the @xmath69-functions ( see eq .",
    "( [ inv ] ) for the definition of the scaled invariants ) .",
    "then we solve the constraint @xmath164 for @xmath165 and substitute @xmath166 .",
    "for the remaining variables we substitute x_4&=&t_4 + x_5&=&t_1+t_5(1-t_1)(1-t_4 ) + y_2&=&t_1(1-t_2)t_4 + y_6&=&t_1t_4[remap ] to arrive at the following form for the phase space & & d_14 = ( 2)^4- 3d ( q^2)^3 d/2 - 4 2 ^ -2d+1 d_d-2 d_d-3",
    "d_d-4 + & & _ 0 ^ 1 dt_1  dt_5 [ ( 1-t_1)t_4(1-t_4)]^d-3[t_1t_2(1-t_2)t_5(1-t_5)]^ [ t_3(1-t_3)]^(d-5)/2.[fi4tra ] the expression for @xmath167 in eq .  ( [ eqj4 ] ) then becomes j_4&= & _ 0 ^ 1 dt_1 ",
    "dt_5 [ t_1(1-t_2)]^-1-t_4 ^ -1 - 2(1-t_1)^1 - 2(1-t_4)^2 - 2 + & & [ t_2t_5(1-t_5)]^-[t_3(1-t_3)]^-1/2- ( ( t_1(1-t_2)+t_2)-_3 ( ) ) + _ 3()&=&t_2t_5+t_1(1-t_2)(1-t_5)-2(1 - 2t_3 ) + & = & y_3()/(1-t_4 ) .",
    "we see that in this parametrisation , the denominators in @xmath167 are factorising completely",
    ". however , other denominators in the full matrix element will in general contain @xmath168 in the denominator . in this case",
    "it is convenient to shuffle the square - root terms to the numerator by the following non - linear transformation  @xcite : we substitute t_3&= & y_3=. [ quad ] the jacobian therefore cancels one factor of @xmath169 in the denominator : = = , leading to & & _ 0 ^ 1 d t_3 ^ = _ 0 ^ 1 d t_3",
    "^ + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 d z_3 ^ [ y_3 ^ -+z_3(y_3^+-y_3 ^ -)]^4-d . this way the square - roots in the denominator are eliminated and the limits @xmath170 and @xmath171 are decoupled , but note that instead of @xmath172 we now have a factor ^= ^d-5= ( 1-t_4)^d-5^d-5.the factor @xmath173 will be combined with phase space factors and is of endpoint - type anyway , but there are singularities which now occur on a manifold defined by @xmath174 . in the case at hand",
    "they are easily remapped to the boundaries by splitting e.g. the @xmath175-integration region at t_2 ^ 0= [ t20 ] and substituting t_2=t_2 ^ 0u_2 & & t_2<t_2 ^ 0 , + t_2=1-(1-t_2 ^ 0)u_2 & & t_2>t_2 ^ 0[hole ] to obtain again integrals from zero to one .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , we have to deal with the following types of singularities :    * endpoint singularities * singularities on a manifold not confined to the boundaries of phase space , more precisely the boundaries after having solved all constraints and remapped the integrations to the unit hypercube .",
    "endpoint singularities , if not factorising from the start , are easily extracted by the sector decomposition algorithm .",
    "it should be mentioned however that , if we do not use primary sector decomposition , endpoint singularities can occur not only if an integration variable goes to zero , but also at the upper integration boundary ( which is equal to one , after appropriate remapping ) . in order to apply the algorithm described in section [ itersd ]",
    ", we should remap the singularities for @xmath176 such that they occur at the origin only . as some variables can cause singularities at zero _ and _ one ,",
    "a transformation @xmath177 is not recommended .",
    "instead , we split the integration range at 1/2 : after the split @xmath178 and the substitution @xmath179 in @xmath180 and @xmath181 in @xmath182 , all endpoint singularities occur at @xmath183 only .",
    "the disadvantage of such splittings is the fact that we end up with @xmath184 integrals after @xmath185 splittings , but in practice , considering the physically possible singular limits , some of the integration variables clearly never will lead to a singularity when approaching one , and therefore do not require such a splitting .    concerning the singularities at the interior of phase space , the recipe is less simple .",
    "however , for @xmath186 in a @xmath187 or a @xmath188 phase space , it is easy to see that they can always be remapped to the phase space boundaries .",
    "quite in general , the boundaries of the physical region in the space of invariants follow from the momentum conserving @xmath69-function and the gram determinants @xmath189 . as",
    "the gram matrices are symmetric , the determinants will be polynomials of maximal degree two in each invariant @xmath190 .",
    "masses do not alter this argument , and one can show that always @xmath191 and @xmath192  @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath193 is trivial , so let us first consider the case @xmath194 . solving the constraint @xmath195 for one of the invariants @xmath196 leads to @xmath197 , where the structure of @xmath198 is fixed by the fact that @xmath192 is a kllen function : these terms must be _ linear _ in each invariant ( see e.g. eq .  ( [ y3pm ] ) ) . after having performed substitutions of the type ( [ remap ] ) to eliminate the momentum conserving @xmath69-function , the linearity is not manifestly preserved , but as the singularity structure can not change by these substitutions , some of the @xmath199 must always factorise , which guarantees that the condition @xmath192 imposing the phase space boundaries in the new variables can be solved for , say , the variable @xmath200 in such a way that @xmath200 is the ratio of two polynomials in the remaining parameters ( see e.g. eq .  ( [ t20 ] ) ) , therefore leading to structures amenable to sector decomposition .    for @xmath201 , in a @xmath187 or a @xmath188 phase space ,",
    "additional constraints are present due the fact that , for 4-dimensional momenta , @xmath202 for @xmath201 . however ,",
    "if the phase space is expressed in terms of a convolution of processes of lower multiplicity as explained above , the same reasoning for the remapping of singularities as in the @xmath186 case can be applied .",
    "different phase space parametrisations are related by lorentz transformations , therefore it is sufficient to show this property for a particular parametrisation .",
    "this does not mean that all parametrisations actually do have the desired properties , it only states that a better parametrisation must exist where the remapping to a form more suitable for sector decomposition is possible .",
    "one last point concerning different types of singularities should be made : in renormalisable theories , the ",
    "physical \" singularities are not worse than logarithmic , which means that the parameter integrals after sector decomposition should be of the form @xmath203 , where @xmath204 .",
    "if only the denominators are considered in a complex matrix element , terms with @xmath205 will occur .",
    "this type of spurious singularity will finally cancel with terms from the numerator , but the cancellation is not manifest if we leave the numerator symbolic throughout the whole procedure .",
    "therefore it is advisable to include the numerator at the level of the @xmath206-expansion , at least for the parts where @xmath205 .",
    "the isolation of infrared poles by sector decomposition is an algebraic procedure , leading to a set of finite functions for each pole coefficient as well as for the finite part .",
    "the finite functions have the form of parameter integrals over the unit interval and are therefore well suited for integration by monte carlo methods . if a full cross section beyond the leading order , composed of both real and virtual corrections , is to be calculated , the combination of the sector decomposition approach for the real radiation part with analytic results ( if available ) for the part involving loop corrections is certainly possible . in the case of nnlo corrrections",
    ", it is also advisable , as the fully numerical evaluation of two - loop integrals in combination with the phase space integration is in general rather slow , if viable at all .",
    "however , at nlo , examples of a fully numerical evaluation of complete processes based on the combination of sector decomposition with contour deformation do exist  @xcite .",
    "a hybrid approach can consist for example in the reduction of the phase space integrals to cut master integrals , evaluating only the master integrals by sector decomposition  @xcite . concerning the mixed one - loop times single unresolved real radiation part of nnlo calculations , its treatment so",
    "far always involved a reduction to master integrals  @xcite , except in the very recent calculation of the @xmath207 corrections to semileptonic decay @xmath208  @xcite . for these mixed real - virtual contributions , it can further be useful to do parts of the feynman parameter integrations for the master integrals analytically , to obtain hypergeometric functions where transformation formulas for the arguments  @xcite can be used if necessary to arrive at a more convenient form .",
    "then one can proceed by applying sector decomposition to the integral representation of the hypergeometric functions in combination with the phase space variables  @xcite .    to obtain differential results ,",
    "the combination of the output of the sector decomposition procedure with any infrared safe measurement function is possible , as has been first noted in  @xcite .",
    "the flexibility to do so is achieved by expanding the singular factors produced by the decomposition into plus - distributions , using the identity @xmath209_+\\;,\\nn\\\\ & & \\mbox{where } \\nn\\\\ & & \\int_0 ^ 1 dx \\,f(x)\\ , \\left[g(x)/x\\right]_+=\\int_0 ^ 1 dx \\ ,   \\frac{f(x)-f(0)}{x}\\,g(x)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is basically equivalent to the @xmath206-expanded form of eq .",
    "( [ tjsubtr ] ) , the only difference being that , instead of integrating out the singular factors explicitly , the integrands are kept in the form of distributions : @xmath210 is written as @xmath211 instead of @xmath212 .",
    "this allows for the combination with arbitrary functions @xmath213 .",
    "the following features which are special to the sector decomposition approach as compared to monte carlo programs based on analytic subtraction terms should be pointed out :    * the pole coefficients are only calculated numerically , such that the cancellation of poles between real , real - virtual ( existing beyond nlo only ) and purely virtual contributions can be verified only numerically . however , this is in general not a problem because the pole coefficients contain less integration variables and therefore a high numerical precision can be achieved more easily than for the finite part . * the expansion into plus distributions can not be done in complete isolation from the measurement function , because it has to be assured that the subtraction terms only come to action in phase space regions which are allowed by the measurement function . to illustrate this point ,",
    "consider the simple one - dimensional example where the measurement function is just a step function @xmath214 , and the  matrix element \" after sector decomposition is given by @xmath215 .",
    "if we expand into plus distributions and _ afterwards _ just multiply with our measurement function , we obtain @xmath216 clearly , the @xmath217 term stems from the subtraction of a singularity at @xmath218 , which is now killed by our measurement function anyway , such that inclusion of the @xmath217 term would lead to a wrong result .",
    "the correct way is of course to include the measurement function into the expression the plus distribution acts on .",
    "however , this does _ not _ mean that the @xmath206expansions and subtractions have to be redone each time the measurement function is changed .",
    "it can be achieved by including symbolic functions in the @xmath206expansion which are written to the numerical code with zero arguments ( respectively the appropriate singular limit in the general case ) if they correspond to subtraction terms .",
    "the symbolic functions can be specified later in a subroutine of the numerical program . *",
    "the subroutines defining jets , observables etc . will be based on the four - momenta of the particles involved in the scattering process .",
    "the four - momenta can easily be constructed from the _ original _ phase space integration variables . before the decomposition , the phase space integration variables , let us call them @xmath190 , have a certain functional form , @xmath219 .",
    "performing now iterated sector decomposition will remap the parameters @xmath199 , in a different way in each subsector of the decomposition tree , such that _ after _ iterated sector decomposition , the functional dependence of the original variables on the monte carlo integration parameters @xmath220 is different for each subsector .",
    "of course it is easy to keep track of the remappings done in each sector , but the monte carlo program will consist of a sum of contributions from each subsector @xmath107 , each one defining the functional form @xmath221 in a different way .",
    "this is not a problem in principle , but the complexity of nnlo matrix elements is already enormous , so multiplying the evaluation time by the number of subsectors , which is of the order of several hundreds for an nnlo process , can lead to unacceptable cpu times . * as the subtractions done after sector decomposition are of the form @xmath222 in each variable , which means that poles in each variable are _ locally _ subtracted , the method in general leads to expressions which have a good numerical behaviour .",
    "in fact , as even integrable singularities of the type @xmath223 are decomposed , the expressions produced by iterated sector decomposition are of a form which is very convenient for numerical integrations .",
    "however , if the matrix elements to evaluate exceed a certain degree of complexity , there is a turnover where the advantage gained from the form of the individual functions is destroyed by the sheer number of functions to evaluate .",
    "this has been found for example in the attempt to calculate the full real corrections for @xmath147jets at nnlo using only sector decomposition .",
    "the calculation of this process has recently been accomplished  @xcite using analytic  antenna \" subtraction  @xcite . due to the large number of massless particles ,",
    "the infrared structure is extremely complicated , and the number of antenna subtraction terms needed for the analytic subtraction of the poles is already quite large . using sector decomposition leads to an unacceptable number of terms in this case . on the other hand , if massive particles are involved , the situation is completely different : while analytic integrations of subtraction terms become nearly impossible for nnlo calculations with several mass scales , the infrared singularity structure is less complex in the presence of masses , such that the number of terms produced by sector decomposition will be moderate , and the mass dependence of the finite terms produced by the decomposition does not pose a problem for the numerical integration .",
    "the method of sector decomposition is interesting from a more formal field theoretical point of view as well as for phenomenological applications . within the context of dimensional regularisation",
    ", it offers a _ constructive _",
    "scheme for the factorisation and subtraction of infrared poles to ( in principle ) all orders in perturbation theory , not only for individual integrals , but also for entire squared matrix elements .",
    "quite in general , the method consists of two parts : the first is an algebraic one , where the singularities are isolated in terms of a laurent series in @xmath206 , the coefficients being finite parameter integrals .",
    "the second part consists in the evaluation of these parameter integrals , which in general is not possible analytically , and is therefore done numerically by monte carlo integration .",
    "obviously the precision which can be achieved this way is intrinsically limited , compared to the evaluation of functions where all integrations have been performed analytically , or where deterministic numerical integration methods can be applied . however , in most practical applications considered so far , sufficient precision could be reached within a reasonable amount of integration time .",
    "applications of the method to multi - loop integrals have been very successful in providing predictions and cross - checks for cutting - edge analytical calculations , e.g. various types of two - loop box integrals or three - loop vertex functions . a restriction of the method for multi - loop integrals presented here",
    "is given by the fact the numerical evaluation is straightforward only for euclidean points , where all kinematic invariants are negative .",
    "for one - scale problems , like massless two - point or three - point functions , this is not a restriction at all , but if more than three external legs or / and masses are present , there will be branch cuts and thresholds which hinder a straightforward numerical evaluation .",
    "solutions to this problem already have been suggested  @xcite and are subject to current research .    although the algorithm is valid to all orders in principle , there are certainly limitations from cpu - time and memory once a certain degree of complexity is reached .",
    "it is not possible to make a general statement about where exactly the limit is , as it depends not only on the computing resources but also on the way the algorithm is programmed .",
    "further , the number of loops and scales is not the only measure of complexity .",
    "non - planar diagrams in general lead to more complicated expressions , often containing spurious singularities with worse than logarithmic behaviour at intermediate stages .    in combination with its application to infrared singular real radiation , the method of sector decomposition has proven very useful recently to obtain differential results for full processes at nnlo  @xcite .",
    "the main advantages compared to methods based on analytic subtraction are the following : the subtraction procedure lends itself to automation and , due to the  local \" nature of the subtraction terms , leads to expressions with good numerical behaviour .",
    "there is no need for an analytic integration of subtraction terms over the singular phase space regions , which is a big advantage in the presence of massive particles .",
    "the main drawback of the method consists in the fact that it leads to very large expressions for complex processes , as the number of terms is increased in each decomposition step .",
    "in particular for processes involving many massless particles , necessitating a large number of subtraction terms , like e.g. @xmath147jets or @xmath224jets at nnlo , the size of the expressions produced by sector decomposition reaches a limit where differential results with sufficient numerical precision can not be obtained within reasonable cpu times . fortunately , most processes relevant for high precision phenomenology involve both massive and massless particles , where the method of sector decomposition has an enormous potential , not suffering from the limitations imposed by analytic integrability .",
    "part of the problem with intractably large expressions is related to the fact that the algorithm , in its fully automated form , makes a decomposition already if the _ necessary _ condition to produce a singularity in @xmath3 is fulfilled ( e.g. vanishing of the function @xmath49 in the case of loop integrals ) .",
    "however , this is not always _ sufficient _ to produce a singularity .",
    "knowledge about the physical singularity structure ( i.e. the soft and collinear limits ) and inspection by eye of certain terms can certainly help to prevent unnecessary decompositions , but the applicability of such criteria is rather limited for complicated expressions as occurring e.g. in nnlo matrix elements , where a fully automated treatment is mandatory .",
    "therefore , in order to minimise the number of produced terms , it would be useful to have an algorithm which finds the _ minimal _ number of decompositions necessary to extract the singularities . in the case of scalar loop integrals , this is basically a mathematical problem .",
    "if full processes are considered , a solution depends crucially on the way the numerator functions are treated . in any case",
    "this issue deserves further study .",
    "finally , it is clear that the key to an optimal solution often consists in combining several methods in a clever way .",
    "the universality of sector decomposition , as a general method to isolate singularities from parameter integrals , suggests that it is a good candidate for such combined approaches .",
