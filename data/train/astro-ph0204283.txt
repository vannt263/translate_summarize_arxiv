    "during a deep search of the globular cluster ( gc ) system for millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , carried out using the parkes radio telescope , we discovered ( damico et al .",
    "2001a ) a binary msp ( hereafter psr - a ) associated with ngc  6752 , a core - collapsed cluster showing evidence of mass segregation ( ferraro et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the resulting knowledge of the dispersion measure ( dm ) for this cluster has facilitated the discovery of four additional msps ( hereafter psrs b , c , d , e ) in the same cluster ( damico et al .",
    "we have made frequent observations using the parkes telescope to obtain coherent timing solutions for these pulsars .",
    "these results can be used to estimate a variety of physical properties of the pulsars and of the host cluster . in particular ,",
    "if the measured period derivatives are dominated by the dynamical effects of the cluster gravitational field , they can be used to constrain the mass - density distribution of the cluster , giving information on the gc s dynamical status and on the population of optically unseen cluster members . in this paper",
    "we report on the first 15 months of pulse timing observations , providing rotational and positional parameters for the five msps known in ngc  6752 , and we use the pulsar positions and inferred accelerations to probe the dynamical status of the cluster .",
    "regular pulsar timing observations of ngc  6752 have been carried out since 2000 september with the parkes 64-m radio telescope , using the center beam of the multibeam receiver at 1400 mhz .",
    "the hardware system is the same as that used in the discovery observations ( damico et al .",
    "the effects of interstellar dispersion are minimized by using a filter bank having 512 @xmath2 0.5 mhz frequency channels for each polarization .",
    "after detection , the signals from individual channels are added in polarization pairs , integrated , 1 bit - digitized every 125 @xmath3s , and recorded to magnetic tape for off - line analysis .",
    "observation times are typically 12 hours .",
    "pulse times of arrival ( toas ) are determined by fitting a standard high signal - to - noise ratio pulse profile to the observed mean pulse profiles and analyzed using the program tempo and the de200 solar system ephemeris ( standish 1982 ) .",
    "table  1 lists the timing parameters obtained for the five pulsars , including precise positions .",
    "because these pulsars have relatively low dms@xmath433 @xmath5pc , interstellar scintillation strongly affects their detectability .",
    "in particular , psr - b was detected on only 27 of 140 observations of the cluster .",
    "the mean flux densities at 1400 mhz ( @xmath6 ) in table  1 are averaged values , derived from the observed signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "non - detections were accounted for by assuming @xmath6 values corresponding to half the detection limits . as can be seen from table  1 , all but psr - a are isolated msps .",
    "psrs b , d and e are located close to the cluster center .",
    "psr - d has the third largest period derivative , @xmath7 among known msps , after psr b1820@xmath830a in ngc  6624 and psr b1821@xmath824 in m28 , suggesting that the @xmath9 is dominated by the line - of - sight acceleration in the cluster gravitational field .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the large negative @xmath9 values observed for psr b and e , which are also located close to the cluster center .",
    "psr - c is located @xmath10 from the cluster center , equivalent to about 1.4 half - mass radii or 24 core - radii , assuming a core radius @xmath11 ( lugger , cohn & grindlay 1995 ) , a half - mass radius @xmath12 ( djorgovski 1993 ) , and an optical center for the cluster of ( j2000 ) r.a.=19@xmath13 10@xmath14 @xmath15 and dec.=@xmath859@xmath16 58@xmath17 55@xmath18 ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "previously , the largest offset of an associated pulsar from a gc center was for psr b2127 + 11c ( prince et al .",
    "1991 ) , a member of a double - neutron - star eccentric binary in m15 , located at @xmath4 0.8 half - mass radii . given the large offset of psr - c from the gc center , its period derivative is not significantly affected by the gc potential well , allowing the measurement of the characteristic age ( @xmath19 yr , the largest among known pulsars ) , the surface magnetic field ( @xmath20 gauss ) and the rotational energy loss ( @xmath21 = 3.95@xmath2 10@xmath22 = 5.9@xmath23 erg s@xmath24 ) .    psr - a , the first pulsar discovered in this cluster , is located even farther from the center , at @xmath25 , equivalent to 3.3 half - mass radii or @xmath26 core radii .",
    "given this large radial offset , one could question the association of the pulsar with the cluster .",
    "based on the 19 msps with @xmath27 mjy detected by the parkes southern pulsar survey ( lyne et al .",
    "1998 ) and assuming a typical spectral index @xmath28 ( toscano et al . 1998 ) for msps , the probability of chance superposition of a galactic field msp with @xmath29 mjy within @xmath25 of the center of ngc  6752 is at most @xmath30 .",
    "this probability is further reduced by noting that all five pulsars have very similar dm values . also in this case the observed",
    "period derivative can be used to measure the pulsar parameters @xmath31 yr , @xmath32 gauss , and @xmath33 erg s@xmath24 .",
    "accurate dms were obtained for each pulsar by splitting the 256-mhz bandwidth into two adjacent sub - bands and computing the differential delays .",
    "the maximum deviation ( @xmath40.3 @xmath5 pc ) of the dm values derived for each pulsar from the average ( 33.36 @xmath5 pc ) is similar to that observed in other gcs hosting several msps like 47  tucanae ( freire et al .",
    "2001 ) and m15 ( anderson et al .",
    "1990 ) . given the wide angular offsets of some of the pulsars , the scatter in some of the dms could arise from gradients in the galactic column density across different lines - of - sight toward the cluster ( armstrong , rickett & spangler 1995 ) .",
    "it could also arise from an enhanced electron density within the cluster ( see freire et al .",
    "2001 ) . excluding the peripheral psr - a",
    ", a rough estimate of the density of such gas is given by @xmath34 @xmath5 , where @xmath35 is the rms deviation in the dms and @xmath36 is the one - dimensional dispersion of the angular offsets in radians with respect to the gc center in the plane of the sky for the 4 inner msps .",
    "@xmath37 kpc ( renzini et al . 1996 ) is the cluster distance ( the errors are reported at the 1@xmath38-level , as everywhere in this paper and in table  1 ) .",
    "this @xmath39 value is about a factor of ten smaller than that inferred from the four msps ( with @xmath40 ms ) in the core - collapsed cluster m15 and @xmath41 of that derived using a more refined modeling of the plasma content in 47  tuc ( freire et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "ngc 6752 was observed recently for @xmath42 s with the acis - s detector aboard the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory by pooley et al .",
    "the position of psr - d is consistent with that of the _ chandra _ source labeled cx11 by pooley et al .",
    "all the msps but psr - a are located in the _ chandra _ field of view , but psr - c is outside the half - mass radius region searched for x - ray sources by pooley et al .",
    "thus we have processed the full acis - s3 image in the 0.56.0 kev band using the ciao 2.2 software , resulting in the detection of two additional probable x - ray counterparts to the msps . using the _ wavedetect _ tool ,",
    "we have found a weak soft source whose error circle encloses psr - c , having a hardness ratio ( as defined by grindlay et al .",
    "2001a ) @xmath43 5.5 .",
    "assuming isotropic x - ray emission and a hydrogen column density @xmath44 @xmath45 , we obtain for three different spectral models ( a power - law of photon index @xmath46 , a blackbody with @xmath47 kev or a thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath48 kev ) similar values of the x - ray luminosity in the 0.52.5 kev band , @xmath49=2.2@xmath50 erg s@xmath24 , corresponding to a conversion efficiency @xmath51 .",
    "this is somewhat higher than that predicted on the basis of both the sample of msps observed in 47 tuc and the sample of msps in the galactic field ( grindlay et al .",
    "2002 ) . using the _ celldetect _ tool ,",
    "we have also found marginal evidence for a slightly harder source compatible with the position of psr - b , having a hardness ratio @xmath4 4 and @xmath49 = 1.1@xmath50 erg s@xmath24 .",
    "this source is surrounded by many other sources and the nominal _ celldetect _ signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath41.5 , is low . no x - ray source is associated with psr - e , with an upper limit to the x - ray luminosity in the 0.52.5 kev band of @xmath52 erg s@xmath24 . based on the three probable positional coincidences , we have used the msp positions obtained via radio timing to derive a corrected _ chandra _ astrometric solution , requiring a shift of the _ chandra _ positions by @xmath53 in ra and @xmath54 in dec , with a final rms ( of the differences between _ chandra _ and radio positions ) of @xmath55 in ra and @xmath56 in dec , consistent with the expected positional uncertainties of @xmath57 ( pooley et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows an optical image of the cluster , the positions of the five msps and the contour levels of the _ chandra _ image .",
    "pooley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) pointed out that the x - ray sources in the central @xmath58 region lie in the south - east quadrant .",
    "while they ascribe this to chance , we note that most of the x - ray sources within the half - mass radius region are roughly distributed along a stretched s - shaped pattern , whose elongated ends are oriented in the east  west direction .",
    "the large negative @xmath9 values observed in psrs b and e can be used to derive lower limits to the line - of - sight accelerations , @xmath59 s@xmath24 , for both pulsars , which are the largest known after those of psrs  b2127 + 11a and d in the core of m15 ( anderson et al .",
    "contributions from centrifugal acceleration ( shklovskii 1970 ) , differential galactic rotation ( damour & taylor 1991 ) and vertical acceleration in the galactic potential ( kuijken & gilmore 1989 ) are all negligible .",
    "finally , according to figures  3 and 4 of phinney ( 1993 ) , the probability that the accelerations of both psrs b and e are dominated by a nearby star in the cluster is @xmath60 .",
    "thus we can conclude that the inferred high values of @xmath61 are due to the potential well of ngc  6752 .    a lower limit to the mass - to - light ratio in the inner regions of ngc  6752 can be derived from the following rule , which holds to within @xmath410% in all plausible cluster models ( phinney 1992 ) : @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the mean surface brightness within a line of sight subtended by an angle @xmath64 with respect to the cluster center",
    ", @xmath65 is the mass enclosed in the cylindrical volume of radius @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the mean _ projected _ mass - to - light ratio in the v - band . 0.5truecm",
    "= 8.9truecm = 6.2truecm 0.5truecm we use the most recent published brightness profile for this cluster ( lugger , cohn & grindlay 1995 ) , normalized to the central surface brightness in the v - band reported by djorgovski ( 1993 ) , in order to plot the curves of maximum @xmath68 for different values of @xmath67 . in figure",
    "2 the histogram represents the data for @xmath67=1.1 , as suggested by pryor & meylan ( 1993 ) .",
    "this greatly underestimates the observed values of @xmath69 .",
    "the dashed lines are analytical fits ( with reduced @xmath701 ) to the observed data , scaled according to increasing values of @xmath67 .",
    "only @xmath719 can account for the observed @xmath72 of psrs b and e. an even larger @xmath71 13 is required if psr - d has a negligible intrinsic @xmath73 as might be expected given the close projected positions and the similar absolute values of @xmath69 for psrs b , d and e. a reasonable interpretation is that psr d is at about the same distance from the gc center as the psrs b and e , but in the closer half of the cluster , whereas psrs b and e reside in the further half . in this case , for these 3 msps the intrinsic @xmath74 can be estimated as the average of those of psrs b ( or e ) and d. values of @xmath67 in the interval @xmath75 result if the observed scalings between x - ray luminosity and spin - down power for msps are used to estimate the magnetic - dipole braking contribution to @xmath69 for psr - d ( see caption of fig .  2 ) .",
    "we finally note that these estimates of the projected @xmath67 are independent of distance , excepting the effects of extinction , which are very small for ngc  6752 , with e(b@xmath8v ) = 0.04 ( harris 1996 ) , and of modeling of the cluster potential .",
    "these results imply ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] ) that there must be @xmath76 of matter in the form of low - luminosity stellar objects within the projected radius of psr - e , @xmath77 pc . adopting the prescription of djorgovski ( 1993 ) and a core radius @xmath78 ( lugger , cohn & grindlay 1995 )",
    "this in turn corresponds to a central mass density @xmath79pc@xmath80 , at least five times larger than that derived from measurements in the optical band ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "the stars whose initial mass was in the interval 0.60.8",
    "@xmath81 ( bracketing the current turn - off point of the cluster ) now dominate the total integrated v - band luminosity of ngc  6752 , @xmath82 ( djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "0.5truecm = 8.5truecm = 9.truecm 0.5truecm assuming a typical mass - to - light ratio for these stars of @xmath83 ( phinney 1993 ) , the number of 0.60.8  @xmath81 stars is @xmath84 . assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) @xmath85 with @xmath86 , the evolution of stars having initial mass @xmath87 should have left at most @xmath88 dark remnants .",
    "if they sank towards the cluster center and are responsible for the high value of the mass - to - light ratio in the core , their average mass would be @xmath89 , suggesting that at least some of them must be black holes .",
    "the same conclusions apply to any power - law imf steeper than salpeter s .",
    "conversely , if we assume that the low - luminosity objects within the central @xmath77 pc are all 1.4@xmath81 neutron stars ( nss ) , this would imply @xmath90 for the slope of the imf .",
    "given the very low upper limit on the density of any ionized gas , @xmath91 nss could reside in the inner region of ngc  6752 without producing an accretion luminosity detectable in the deep _ chandra _ exposure of pooley et al .",
    "alternatively , if the population of the central region is dominated by massive white dwarfs ( descendents of stars of initial mass @xmath92 ) , we obtain a nominal limit @xmath93 .",
    "however , these @xmath41@xmath81 remnants ( less massive than the population of msps ) should distribute out to larger distances from the cluster center than psr - e .",
    "a conservative 60% increase in their estimated number implies an imf flatter than salpeter s in this case as well .",
    "we note that both the uncertainties in the average mass - to - light ratio of the 0.60.8  @xmath81 stars and the unknown number of these stars which have been tidally stripped or evaporated from the cluster since its formation could affect @xmath94 and thus our results .",
    "however , simulations of strongly concentrated clusters ( e.g.  joshi , nave & rasio 2001 ) indicate that the relative depletion of 0.60.8  @xmath81 stars should be smaller than that of neutron stars , which escape the cluster potential well due to supernova kicks at birth ( rappaport et al .",
    "such an effect would further increase the average mass @xmath95 of dark remnant stars and/or make the imf even flatter .",
    "our results provide the first direct dynamical evidence for a high density of unseen remnants in the core of a globular cluster , suggesting a mass - to - light ratio @xmath9610 in the core region . for comparison",
    ", we note that a much smaller value @xmath97 was obtained for the case of m15 ( phinney 1993 ) , a core - collapsed gc long suspected to host a central black - hole ( see e.g. van der marel & roeland 1999 ) .",
    "the nature of the remnants in the core of ngc  6752 is not clear as it strongly depends on assumptions about the imf .",
    "however , the possibility that they are black holes , or that many stellar remnants have collapsed into a single massive black hole , is intriguing .",
    "in addition , the large offsets of psrs a and c from the cluster center indicate the occurrence of highly effective non - thermal dynamics in the cluster core .",
    "no other gc shows an msp ejected beyond its half - mass radius ( which requires a finely tuned impulse to avoid prompt expulsion of the ns from the gc ) , while ngc  6752 has two of them .",
    "they could result from exchange encounters in the core ( phinney & sigurdsson 1991 ) but the large offset of psr - a suggests also the occurrence of more powerful scattering events ( colpi , possenti & gualandris 2002 ) .",
    "the scattering target must have treated this binary system as a point mass , ejecting it without inducing appreciable eccentricity . assuming a value of 1.4 m@xmath98 for the pulsar , the total mass of the binary system containing psr - a is at least 1.6 m@xmath98 .",
    "simple dynamical considerations favor a scattering target significantly more massive than the scattered binary , supporting the conclusion that it could be of many solar masses .",
    "a black - hole binary system would be a natural candidate .",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations do not place severe limits on its maximum mass .",
    "the arguments of grindlay et al .",
    "( 2001a ) applied to an electron gas density @xmath99 @xmath5 and a detection threshold of @xmath100 erg s@xmath24 , allow for up to a few hundred solar masses in the form of black hole(s ) present in the central region of ngc  6752 .",
    "finally , the pattern of x - ray sources , roughly oriented midway between the probable projected ejection directions of psrs a and c , suggests a preferential geometry for ejection , similar to that discussed by grindlay et al .",
    "( 2001b ) for ngc  6397 .",
    "its physical connection with the inferred high density of unseen matter in the core is not clear , but it could be a further signature of significant non - thermal activity in the core region .",
