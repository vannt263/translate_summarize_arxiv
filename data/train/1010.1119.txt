    "the light - curve modulation of rrab stars ( blazhko effect ) is one of the most outstanding problems of stellar pulsation theory , which has remained unsolved despite continuous observational and theoretical efforts .",
    "recent , accurate , ground based and space observations @xcite reveal more and more details of the snapshots of the modulations properties .",
    "however , contrary to the remarkable stability of the light curves of non - modulated rrab stars , the modulation properties of blazhko variables may show significant changes on time - scales of years and decades e.g. in the cases of rr gem @xcite , rr lyr @xcite and xz cyg @xcite .",
    "the only way to study these long - term changes is to combine archival data with modern observations .",
    "globular clusters , which have been already observed regularly on a time base longer than a century , are ideal targets for following the variations of the modulation properties of blazhko stars , provided that the modulation is strong enough to be detected in photographic data",
    ".    an accurate knowledge of the blazhko - star population in globular clusters also yields an important information for determining the incidence of this phenomenon .",
    "recent surveys show that about half the rrab stars exhibit light - curve modulation in some samples @xcite , while previous estimates gave only 1030 per cent .",
    "m5 , one of the closest globular clusters with about 100 rr lyrae stars having been continuously observed during the 20@xmath2 century , is one of the few possible targets for these studies .",
    "blazhko stars are quite numerous in m5 based on previous photographic and ccd investigations .",
    "already ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter oo41 ) noted that the light curves of v2 , v4 , v14 , v18 , v27 , v52 , v63 and v72 in m5 were not stable ; they showed irregular or rw dra - type variability .",
    "blazhko effect was also identified by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter kk71 ) in v2 , v14 , v18 , v58 and v63 .",

    "* hereafter k00 ) noted light - curve variability of v2 , v4 , v5 , v8 , v14 , v27 , v56 , v65 , v89 and v97 .",
    "a comprehensive study of the blazhko stars in m5 is , however , still missing . in (",

    "the homogenized ( see section 2.3 of paper i ) light curves of the rrab stars in m5 were carefully examined to identify variables showing light - curve instability . due to crowding problems , this was not possible for all the rrab stars in our sample .",
    "variables lying in too crowded areas and/or having close bright companions could not be measured accurately enough to detect light - curve variability without doubt .",
    "this was especially true if no ccd observation of the variable was available .",
    "from the 65 rrab stars for which phase variation diagrams were constructed in paper i , this was the case for 15 stars ( v6 , v13 , v17 , v25 , v26 , v36 , v37 , v54 , v74 , v83 , v85 , v90 , v91 , v92 and v96 ) .",
    "these stars were denoted by the letter ` @xmath24 ' in the ` remarks ' column of table 4 in paper i. the combined photographic and ccd @xmath25 light curves of the remaining 50 rrab stars were studied using different methods in order to detect light - curve variations and to determine modulation periods if it was possible .",
    "when ccd @xmath1 observations from different sources were also available , these data were investigated separately .",
    "different segments of the data were checked and analysed . if light - curve variability was suspected in any part of the data , fourier analyses of the light curves and the maximum brightness / maximum timing data",
    "were also applied .",
    "the maximum brightness / phase data of globular - cluster variables are , however , very sparse ( one - two data per season if any ) , and give useable information only in very few cases ( e.g. in v19 ) .",
    "we searched for modulation - frequency signals in the vicinity of the low - order pulsation frequency components ( @xmath26 ) corresponding to the same modulation frequency ( @xmath27 ) . the modulation period ( @xmath28 )",
    "was then determined by a non - linear process that fitted the pulsation and some of the modulation frequencies ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) and their amplitudes and phases simultaneously to the data .",
    "a blazhko classification was assigned if at least one of the following criteria was fulfilled :    * changes in the light curve s amplitude , shape and/or phase were detected , * at least three modulation frequencies , corresponding to the same modulation period , appeared around the frequencies of the pulsation components in the residual spectrum of one subset of the light - curve data , * frequencies , corresponding to the same modulation period , appeared in the residual spectra of different subsets of the observations .",
    "we note , however , that without accurate , extended , ccd photometric observations the results obtained from inhomogeneous , photographic data have to be regarded as somewhat uncertain .",
    "even though the available ccd observations of the m5 variables show clear evidence of light - curve modulation in some cases , they do not allow the determination of the blazhko period for any of the variables .",
    "another problem is that the photographic data are seriously affected by daily , monthly and yearly aliases , which may result in an erroneous blazhko period .",
    "if a modulation period could be determined , its reality was visually checked using animations of the light curves in different phases of the modulation . the animated light curves of the m5 blazhko variables and the data sets that were used are available at the url : http + : www.konkoly.hu/24/publications/m5 .",

    "no similar result has been previously shown . however , in most studies of globular - cluster blazhko stars , the mean brightness has been determined without any distinction of the pulsation / modulation phase coverage of the data .",
    "these mean magnitudes may be seriously affected by the incomplete light - curve coverage that is typical in photometric observations of globular - cluster variables . in our previous studies of the field blazhko variables ( e.g. in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it was shown that the mean brightness determined using a complete pulsation light curve at only one blazhko phase does not differ more than @xmath64 mag from the true mean brightness .",
    "the mean - brightness values of blazhko variables are determined in this way here , so they can be regarded as relatively accurate .",
    "these specific features of the blazhko stars raise the possibility that the onset of the blazhko phenomenon is induced by evolution .",
    "one may speculate that the pulsation of rrab stars evolving blueward becomes unstable against the blazhko effect ( whatever it is ) just preceding the mode switch to first - overtone pulsation . a possible relation between the blazhko and",
    "the double - mode stars has been already proposed by @xcite . however , detailed modelling of the mode switch from fundamental to overtone mode is still lacking .    reviewing the variable populations of the globular clusters rich in rr lyr stars , one finds that they are either rich in blazhko stars ( ngc362 , ngc 3201 , m5 , @xmath65 cen ) or in double - mode variables ( ic4499 , m15 ) or in both ( m3 , m68 ) .",
    "blazhko phenomenon is quite common among the galactic - field rrab stars @xcite , but double - mode pulsators are rare .",
    "the occurrence of double mode and/or blazhko stars in the different stellar populations , however , does not show clear correlation with any of their properties e.g. metallicity , hb - type , oosterhoff - type .",
    "while blazhko stars appear in all the globular clusters with large rr lyrae population , variables showing fundamental - mode and first - overtone pulsation simultaneously are known basically only in m3 , m15 , m68 , ic4499 .",
    "searching for the properties that foster the appearance of double mode or blazhko modulation would be an important issue in disclosing any possible connection between these phenomena .",
    "there is even a unique variable , v79 @xcite in m3 , which shares the properties of both the double - mode and the blazhko phenomena .",
    "v79 was a double - mode pulsator for 15 years , between 1992 and 2007 .",
    "however , observations made in 20082009 showed it to be pulsating in the fundamental mode with a 65-d modulation period .",
    "thus this is a good example of a star that confirms nemec s ( 1985 ) proposal .",
    "in paper i it was already shown that variables with irregular changes in their pulsation period all show the blazhko effect , provided they have photometric data suitable for detecting light - curve variability . from the 20 blazhko variables listed in table  [ bltab ] ,",
    "two do not show any period change , one has an increasing period with irregular fluctuations superimposed , one has a period that increases , but not at a uniform rate , two have periods that decrease steadily , one has strong irregularity superimposed on its gradual period decrease and 12 show nothing but irregular period fluctuations .",
    "( the remaining star does not have enough observations for characterizing its period - change behaviour . ) clearly , it can be concluded that the occurrence of the blazhko modulation is usually accompanied by irregular fluctuations of the pulsation period and vice versa .",
    "we note that @xcite proposed a model that could account for both the irregular period changes and the blazhko effect .",
    "he attributed them to hydromagnetic effects in the atmosphere of the pulsating star .",
    "the amplitude of the modulation of v18 is so large that sometimes it suppresses the pulsation totally .",
    "a similar example is v442 her @xcite with pulsation amplitude varying between 1.4 and 0.2-mag in the @xmath1 band .",
    "modulation periods could not be derived for either star . in both stars , significant changes of",
    "the light - curve shape and amplitude occur from one season to the next , while the seasonal light curves , spanning @xmath66 days , are surprisingly homogeneous .",
    "the pulsation - period variations are extremely large ; random period changes of the order of @xmath67 d are detected in both stars .",
    "another globular - cluster variable that exhibits light - curve changes from one season to the next is the short - period rrab star , v15 , in the oosterhoff - type i cluster m4 @xcite .",
    "it seems that in these special cases the blazhko effect manifests itself in strong , random , abrupt changes of the light curves , lacking any clear periodic behaviour .",
    "this type of the modulation definitely can not be explained by the appearence of non - radial - mode oscillations with frequencies close to the pulsation frequencies .",
    "other blazhko stars with a special character are v29 and v72 .",
    "these stars show hardly any amplitude variation , but their pulsation phase vary considerably on time - scales of some hundreds to thousands of days .",
    "the galactic - field analogue of these stars is rs boo @xcite , with @xmath68 mag amplitude and @xmath69 min phase modulations during its 530-d modulation cycle .",
    "the long - term pulsation - period variation of each of these stars is relatively simple : it is steadily decreasing for v29 , fits two constant periods differing by @xmath70 d for v72 , and has increased throughout the 110 years time base of the observations for rs boo . for v29 and v72 some fluctuations are superimposed on the global trend of their period variations ( see also paper i ) .",
    "the modulations of these blazhko stars are dominated by cyclic or periodic phase variations .",
    "an important issue would be to determine why in some blazhko stars the modulation is dominated by amplitude variations , while in others it is dominated by phase oscillations .",
    "significantly different frequencies of the modulation have been derived for different epochs for two blazhko stars ( v2 and v14 ) , which can not be explained by continuous changes of the modulation period .",
    "the ratios of the detected modulation periods are close to 2:1 and 4:3 for v2 and v14 , respectively .",
    "another case of strong multiperiodicity of the modulation has been documented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cz lacertae ) .",
    "the modulation frequencies detected in cz lac were very close to 3:4 and 4:5 resonances .",
    "rich modulation frequency patterns with multiplets of the same modulation frequency were revealed in extended , accurate observations of some blazhko stars ( mw lyr and v1127 aql in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these cases the dominant modulation corresponded to the shortest frequency component of the multiplets",
    "however , the examples of v2 , v14 and cz lac show that in some blazhko stars , from time to time , different components of a hidden modulation frequency multiplet may emerge .",
    "if these modulations correspond to elements of series of equidistant - spacing multiplets , their frequency ratios are close to fractions of small integer numbers .",
    "this indicates that the observed modulation - frequency values may not always correspond to the ` base frequency ' , i.e. the shortest frequency component of a multiplet .",
    "one must be cautious in interpreting the data .      using a large sample of blazhko variables , including stars from the galactic field , globular clusters , the galactic bulge , the lmc and the sagittarius - dwarf galaxy",

    "however , the ranges of the observed pulsation and modulation frequencies are much smaller in m5 than in the sample investigated by @xcite .",

    "the connection between the period changes reflects some tendency rather than an exact relation .",

    "examining these data we failed to find any regular pattern , but some general trends are evident .",
    "first , it seems that in general , there is an anticorrelation between the directions of the pulsation and the modulation period changes , i.e. a negative sign of @xmath86 is more common than a positive one .",
    "secondly , it can be noticed that the relative period variations ( @xmath87 ) and their normalized values tend to have larger absolute values for variables with longer pulsation periods than for shorter period ones .",
    "the pulsation - period variation of one of the blazhko stars , v56 , can be described with a long , periodic / cyclic variation .",
    "this gives a unique possibility to test the binary origin of the long - period @xmath3 variation .",
    "if this were caused by the light - time effect the pulsation and modulation periods should have to show similar variation , because @xmath88 is the function of the elements of the orbit for any periodic signal @xcite .",
    "the observed normalised relative period variation of the pulsation and the modulation periods of v56 is , however , much larger than 1 , it is 840 contradicting the orbital origin of the cyclic , long - period variation .",

    "<S> the light curves of 50 rrab ( rr0 ) stars in m5 collected in paper i are investigated to detect blazhko modulation . </S>",
    "<S> 18 blazhko stars are identified , and modulation is suspected in two additional cases . </S>",
    "<S> the mean pulsation period of blazhko stars is 0.04 d shorter than the mean period of the entire rrab sample in m5 . among the rrab stars with period shorter than 0.55 </S>",
    "<S> d the incidence rate of the modulation is as high as 60 per cent . </S>",
    "<S> the mean @xmath0 colours of blazhko stars overlap with the colours of first overtone rrc ( rr1 ) pulsators . </S>",
    "<S> the mean @xmath1 magnitudes of blazhko stars are on the average 0.05-mag fainter than those of the rrab stars with stable light curves . </S>",
    "<S> blazhko stars tend to be situated close to the zero - age horizontal branch at the blue edge of the fundamental - mode instability strip in m5 . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that this specific location hints that the blazhko effect may have an evolutionary connection with the mode switch from the fundamental to the overtone - mode pulsation .    </S>",
