    "the statistics of earthquakes has been a subject of research for a long time .",
    "one spectacular feature is the wide range of observed earthquake sizes , spanning over ten decades in earthquake moment magnitude ( which is defined to scale as the logarithm of the integral of slip along the fault during the earthquake@xcite ) .",
    "gutenberg and richter@xcite found in the 50 s that the size distribution of regional earthquakes follows a power law over the entire range of observed events .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 of the power law distribution appears to be universal , _",
    "i.e. _ it is approximately the same ( within statistical errors and possible secondary dependency on the tectonic domain ) for all studied regions .",
    "this type of power law distribution is called the `` gutenberg richter '' distribution . recently",
    ", enough data has been collected to extract statistics on individual systems of earthquake faults , or more precisely on systems of narrow fault zones .",
    "interestingly , it was found that the distribution of earthquake magnitudes may vary substantially from one fault system to another .",
    "in particular , wesnousky and coworkers@xcite found that fault systems with highly irregular geometry , such as the san jacinto fault zone in california , which have many offsets and branches , display `` power law '' statistics over the whole range of observed magnitudes .",
    "not all fault systems , however , display a power law distribution on all scales up to the largest earthquakes .",
    "the available data@xcite indicate that fault systems with more regular geometry ( presumably generated progressively with increasing cumulative slip ) such as the san andreas fault in california display power law distributions only for small events , which occur in the time intervals between roughly quasi - periodic earthquakes of a much larger `` characteristic '' size which rupture the entire fault .",
    "there are practically no observed earthquakes of intermediate magnitudes on such geometrically regular fault systems .",
    "distributions of this type are called the `` characteristic earthquake '' distribution .    in previous work@xcite it was demonstrated that a class of simple models of ruptures along a heterogeneous fault zone displays both types of behavior .",
    "the universal power law scaling behavior of earthquake statistics was seen to be due to an underlying critical point , which becomes mean - field - like for fault geometries with more than two spatial dimensions . in the limit of",
    "_ weak _ dynamical effects , the mean - field approximation to the 2 dimensional fault provides a more appropriate approximation than , for example , traditionally studied one dimensional approximations to the models .",
    "in fact , _ exact _",
    "results for the scaling exponents ( up to logarithmic corrections ) could be obtained from mean - field theory .",
    "the reason is that the elastic stresses along the fault are effectively long range ( decaying like the inverse cube of the distance ) , such that in two and higher dimensions the fluctuations due to interaction with other points on the fault decrease as the fault size is increased  on long length scales the behavior becomes the same as that of a system with infinite ranged elastic interactions ( up to logarithmic corrections in two dimensions ) .",
    "in other words , the upper critical dimension is equal to the physical dimension of the fault , which is 2@xcite .",
    "( some of the static mean - field exponents turned out to be the same as in other quasi - static models@xcite . ) in the presence of small but nonzero weakening effects of amplitude @xmath3 a critical rupture size ( slipping area ) @xmath4 for `` runaway '' or `` characteristic fault size '' events was calculated perturbatively @xcite and was found to scale as @xmath5 .",
    "faults of larger area than this size are expected to display the characteristic earthquake distribution , with small events up to size @xmath4 , and no events of intermediate size between @xmath4 and the characteristic fault size events . for faults of smaller total area than @xmath4 only the power law scaling region of the small events is seen , so the distribution is of the gutenberg richter type .    in this paper",
    "we examine a mean - field model with a range of dynamical weakening effects from weak to strong , and different levels of disorder in the brittle properties . specifically , we study the model of ben - zion and rice@xcite , which involves simple approximations of dynamic frictional weakening ( similar to static versus dynamic friction ) , but replace the physical long range elastic interactions with infinite range interactions .",
    "in addition to exhibiting both `` power law '' and `` characteristic '' scaling of event sizes , this model exhibits the possibility of _ coexistence _ of these two types of behavior .",
    "that is , for a given set of model parameters , the system has _ two distinct persistent stationary states_. in an infinitely large system it will depend on the initial conditions whether the system displays gutenberg richter or characteristic earthquake type behavior .",
    "faults of _ finite _ size can spontaneously switch from one state to the other on time scales that are exponentially large in system size . the switching times ( or `` persistence times '' ) are determined by nucleation processes from one state to the other , similar to flips back and forth at coexistence in finite thermally equilibrated systems .",
    "many of the qualitative features seem to be sufficiently robust to be applicable to real fault zones .",
    "interesting to note , such `` switching '' behavior appears to characterize long paleoseismic records observed along the dead sea transform fault system in israel@xcite , and is compatible with other paleoseismic @xcite and geologic@xcite data .",
    "in addition , qualitatively similar switching has been recently found in regional models of disordered fault systems@xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ secmodel ] , we define the model and provide a summary of the main results . in section [ secanalysis ] , we present a detailed analysis of the model along with comparisons with numerical simulations . in section [ secdiscuss ] , we compare our results with earlier studies of similar models and discuss their potential relevance to natural fault systems modeled as a narrow fault zone in a three dimensional elastic surrounding media .",
    "ben - zion and rice@xcite suggested that a heterogeneous fault system with offsets and branches may be represented by an array of discrete cells in a two dimensional plane , with spatially varying `` macroscopic '' constitutive parameters that model the heterogeneity of the original fault system .",
    "this model fault on the @xmath6 plane can be considered as a collection of brittle patches mapped onto the interface between two tectonic blocks , which move with ( small ) relative transverse velocity @xmath7 far away from the fault . in the simple realizations used in refs.@xcite , and here , ( as in related models @xcite )",

    "the stresses at the cells increase uniformly due to the external loading and @xmath18 . as long as no cell reaches its failure threshold , @xmath19 everywhere . when the stress at a cell becomes larger than @xmath20 , the cell slips by an amount @xmath21 , to reduce its stress from @xmath17 to an arrest stress @xmath22 .",

    "value @xmath30 , with @xmath31 parameterizing the relative importance of dynamical weakening effects in the system .",
    "if the failure stress transfer brings other cells to their failure threshold , an avalanche of cell failures , i.e. , `` rupture propagation '' , occurs according to eqs.([eqfailure ] ) until all cells are at stresses @xmath32@xcite .",
    "it is assumed that these avalanches happen on time scales short compared to the external loading time ( i.e. @xmath33 is adiabatically small ) , so that the external load is kept constant during an earthquake . in time intervals between earthquakes ,",
    "all cells are assumed to heal completely , thus failure thresholds are reset to their static value @xmath17 and the external loading resumes until the next cell failure .",

    "( finite size corrections are given in equation ( [ eqpefc ] ) below ) .",

    "[ figpe](b ) , inset ] .",
    "the runaway event is followed by a quiescent period during which stresses on the cells build back up from their dynamic failure value to near their static failure value .",
    "subsequent small events are followed by the next runaway event , at which point the stress distribution is reset to eq.([eqpr ] ) .",
    "these background small events have a size distribution similar to events in the g - r phase , but with a different cutoff size . in an infinite system ( for finite size corrections",
    "see equation ( [ eqperc ] ) below ) : @xmath67 which diverges as @xmath68 . however , this divergence is never observed , as the runaway phase becomes unstable against breakup into the g - r phase when @xmath69 for the following reason : if the background small events during a cycle involve at least a fraction @xmath70 of the cells , the subsequent large event is unable to cause all of the cells to fail , since the cells that failed during background activity are farther away from their failure stress .",
    "this typically causes a spontaneous breakup of the bunched stress distribution and a resumption of the g - r phase .",

    "are both persistent in an infinite system . in an infinite system",
    "the initial conditions determine which one the system displays . in a finite system , however , exponentially rare earthquakes can lead to nucleation from the g - r phase into the runaway phase and vice versa . equations ( [ timefr ] ) and ( [ timerf ] ) below give estimates of the times spent in the respective phases between such nucleation ( or `` switching '' ) events .",
    "the results quoted above have been obtained by mapping earthquakes in the model to corresponding events in a stochastic process , which is approximated by a series of bernoulli trials@xcite in order to be able to obtain analytical estimates for the various quantities of interest , such as distributions of earthquake sizes and persistence times for the two phases .",
    "let us first focus on the g - r phase . at some instant @xmath75 immediately preceding a cell failure , consider the sequence @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the index of the cell that has the @xmath78th largest stress in the system [ see fig .",

    "the inset shows the dependence of mean persistence times on @xmath47 for @xmath154 .",

    "the persistence times in both the g - r phase and the runaway phase diverge exponentially with system size for @xmath155 , and the system remains in either phase for extremely long times , thus the phase space has two almost stable attractors . clearly , the runaway phase represents a more `` ordered '' stress distribution .",
    "indeed , the basin of attraction for the runaway phase is extremely small . in order to quantify this aspect ,",

    "[ figtimeseries ] along with event sizes .",
    "it is clear that @xmath161 can be used as an `` order parameter '' , a number that distinguishes the g - r phase and the runaway phase , with the advantage that it can be determined at any instant .",
    "histograms of event sizes require a finite time interval to collect , and there is always the danger of mixing events from one phase with the other , thereby confusing the picture : the cumulative event size distribution over many persistence times is a weighted average of two entirely different event distributions , which obscures the underlying physical phenomena .",
    "@xmath162 provides a reliable way to separate the two phases and makes it possible to accumulate accurate event size distributions for both of them .",
    "unfortunately , such a quantity can not be determined from existing field data since the spatial distribution of stress is unknown .",
    "so far , the discussion has centered around the @xmath163 limit , and the main role played by the heterogeneities has been the `` randomization '' of the stress distribution at time scales over which all cells fail a few times .",
    "the distribution of loading times , over which the cells are loaded from the individual arrest stress to the failure stress , has a mean @xmath164 and standard deviation of order @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , the  randomization \" time , over which the stress variables @xmath166 become roughly uncorrelated , is of order @xmath167 .",
    "thus , even for small @xmath45 , for large enough @xmath8 this will be small compared to the persistence times , which scale exponentially in n [ see eqs.([timefr ] ) and ( [ timerf ] ) ] .",
    "this ensures the consistency of the assumption that the earthquakes are basically statistically independent of each other .",
    "the validity of this assumption of statistical independence can be explicitly verified by examining the time correlations of event sizes numerically ; indeed no trace of any correlation was found in our simulations , out to many times the randomization time @xmath168 .",
    "likewise , we have explicitly checked that in the runaway phase , the particular realizations of stress distributions immediately following a large event are statistically independent of each other@xcite .    for finite values of @xmath169",
    "we expect most of the features to remain qualitatively unchanged : in the g - r phase , the exponential cutoff size still diverges as @xmath170 and although @xmath171 in general depends on @xmath45 and the shape of @xmath172 there is still a persistent runaway phase for @xmath173 however , the situation is likely to change qualitatively once arrest stresses can be arbitrarily close to failure stresses , i.e. @xmath174 _ and _ new values for the arrest stresses are picked every time a cell fails@xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the situation discussed in ref.@xcite for finite - dimensional systems . immediately upon introduction of dynamical weakening @xmath175 , @xmath176",
    "when @xmath47 approaches @xmath177 i.e. the cutoff size no longer diverges .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath178 the g - r phase is no longer persistent since the persistence time @xmath124 remains finite for large @xmath179    some of the results presented for the mean - field model , especially the qualitative phase diagram , calculated exponents for the power law earthquake distributions , and the divergence of the cutoff length scale , can be expected to apply to models with realistic interactions , up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "such is because the underlying critical points that control these exponents remain mean - field - like down to @xmath50 dimensional faults .",
    "this result is firmly established for the @xmath180 case@xcite . at finite @xmath0",
    "one expects the nucleation size for the runaway phase , which equals @xmath117 in mean field theory , to become independent of the system size , since elastic forces in the fault plane concentrate stresses along the earthquake rupture front as the earthquake progresses .",
    "earthquakes bigger than a finite nucleation size @xmath181 become unstoppable in the presence of dynamic weakening effects and small disorder@xcite , and rupture the entire fault .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath182 the mean - field scaling results may still apply at finite @xmath0 , provided that @xmath169 i.e. , there is a finite minimum stress drop associated with each cell failure . for systems with @xmath183 this range will extend all the way to the fault size . in this case , one remarkable consequence is that since generically @xmath184@xcite , the cutoff size in the g - r phase @xmath116 @xmath185 i.e. , earthquakes on individual fault zones obey power law statistics for events up to a finite fraction of the entire system size .",
    "an important result is the possibility that a fault system might switch from a `` gutenberg - richter '' earthquake distribution spontaneously to a `` characteristic '' earthquake distribution , as in the mean - field model .",
    "we note that calculations based on an entirely different model , simulating the coupled evolution of regional earthquakes and faults in a rheologically layered @xmath186 solid@xcite , show similar behavior .",
    "clear observation of such mode switching in nature requires data sets spanning many thousands of years .",
    "paleoseismic studies attempt to construct long histories of seismic events at given locations from sequences of displaces and highly disturbed rock layers .",
    "remarkably , the longest available paleoseismic records , documenting large earthquake activity along the dead sea transform in israel@xcite appear to be characterized by alternating phases of intense seismic activity lasting a few thousands of years , and periods of comparable length without large seismic events .",
    "other , qualitatively similar alternating deformation phases have been documented in the eastern ca shear zone@xcite and the great basin province in the western us@xcite .",
    "another intriguing possibility might arise in a fault system of weakly coupled segments driven under similar conditions .",
    "the seismic response of such systems might exhibit a sort of `` coexistence '' , i.e. , a fraction of the patches might follow characteristic scaling whereas the others obey gutenberg - richter scaling , giving rise to a hybrid event size distribution .",
    "this may explain examples in the data of reference@xcite , where the characteristic `` bump '' in the distribution was not very pronounced .",
    "finally , we note that part or all of the low magnitude seismicity in the g - r phase may be too small to be detected by a seismic network . in this case the spontaneous switching between the runaway and g - r phases may be interpreted as transitions from seismic response of a fault system to creep - like behavior .",

    "this choice also makes the model abelian , i.e. whether a given cell will fail during an earthquake does not depend on which order they fail , simplifying the analysis .",
    "the estimate for the persistence time does not take into account possible two or many step channels to nucleate from one phase into the other .",

    "these events should not be included in an analysis of the event size distributions , since they are simply transients and not representative of events in steady - state .",
    "the nature of the heterogeneities in our model differs significantly from those considered in ref.@xcite , in that they are _ long - range _ in the displacements @xmath190 , although short - range in position .",
