    "ngc 2506 is an older open cluster which has long been grouped within the iconic class of metal - deficient clusters populating the galactic anticenter just beyond the solar circle , as exemplified by ngc 2204 , ngc 2243 , ngc 2420 , and mel 66 .",
    "a review of the literature on these objects reveals an ongoing debate on just how old and how metal - deficient the individual members of the class are , with clusters like ngc 2243 retaining consistently low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath19 ) as determined by photometry @xcite , medium - resolution spectroscopy @xcite , and high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite , while others like ngc 2420 generate [ fe / h ] from @xmath20 to nearly solar , depending upon the technique adopted @xcite .",
    "the latter example is particularly relevant because , since the first comprehensive , complementary photometric @xcite and astrometric @xcite studies of ngc 2506 , the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of ngc 2506 has exhibited features similar , though not identical , to those of ngc 2420 .",
    "equally important , most recent moderate and high - dispersion spectroscopic work on a handful of giants has consistently shown that the cluster is more metal - poor than ngc 2420 , with [ fe / h ] @xmath21 or less @xcite , in agreement with earlier analyses @xcite . as stellar isochrones and their calibration to standard photometric systems have improved over the last 30 years , the estimated age of ngc 2506 has declined steadily from greater than 3 gyr , similar to m67 , to less than 2 gyr @xcite , making it comparable instead to ngc 3680 , ic 4651 , @xcite and ngc 752 @xcite .",
    "the lower metallicity compared to ngc 752 , ngc 3680 , and especially ic 4651 , in conjunction with the reduced age , makes ngc 2506 a key data point in delineating the roles of both parameters on the evolution of mixing / convection among stars from the main sequence through the giant branch , as well as the collateral impact on the atmospheric li abundance . with astrometric membership @xcite extending at least three magnitudes below the level of a turnoff located only @xmath220.5 mag fainter than that of ngc 2420 ,",
    "ngc 2506 became an obvious choice for inclusion in an analysis of li in stars from the tip of the giant branch to the level of the main sequence li - dip in clusters covering a range in age and metallicity .",
    "details on the scope of the project can be found in a number of papers discussing earlier results on the clusters ngc 3680 @xcite , ngc 6253 @xcite , ngc 752 @xcite , and ngc 6819 @xcite and will not be repeated .",
    "suffice it to say that in any spectroscopic analysis , the validity of both star - to - star and cluster - to - cluster comparisons is ultimately tied to the consistency of the stellar parameters adopted in analyzing the spectra .",
    "this makes precise knowledge of the cluster reddening , stellar mass as defined by the cluster age and distance modulus , and an estimate of the cluster metallicity through photometry and spectroscopy critical to any evaluation of li from the main sequence through the giant branch .",
    "the purposes of this paper are to present estimates of the reddening and metallicity of ngc 2506 using precision ccd photometry on the extended strmgren ( @xmath0h@xmath1 ) system , to identify probable members from a region beyond the original astrometric survey of @xcite , and to derive an age and distance for the cluster through comparison with state - of - the - art isochrones on the strmgren system .",
    "these data will serve as the basis for our spectroscopic analysis of the cluster from hydra spectroscopy extending from the giant branch to almost two magnitudes below the level of the turnoff .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : sec .",
    "2 discusses the ccd observations and their reduction to the standard system for intermediate - band photometry ; sec .",
    "3 uses the photometry , in conjunction with proper - motion membership , to identify and isolate probable cluster members which become the core data set for selecting single , main sequence stars for reddening , metallicity , age , and distance estimates in sec .",
    "5 contains a summary of our conclusions .",
    "ngc 2506 was observed using the 1.0 meter telescope operated by the smarts consortium at cerro tololo interamerican observatory over the ut dates 16 - 22 december , 2011 .",
    "the telescope was equipped with a sta @xmath23 ccd camera yielding a field of view 20  on a side at the cassegrain focus of the 1.0 m telescope .",
    "filters owned by the university of kansas were used to obtain images in each of the extended strmgren system bandpasses ( @xmath0 as well as the two h@xmath1 bandpasses ) . with the exception of 20/21 december , 2011 ,",
    "all of the nights were photometric .",
    "images of ngc 2506 were obtained every night with a subset of the seven filters . on three nights",
    ", frames to construct @xmath8 , @xmath4 , @xmath7 and h@xmath1 were obtained ; two nights were devoted to obtaining @xmath24 frames from which standard strmgren indices could be constructed , with an additional two nights used to obtain @xmath24 and @xmath25 frames . in all , over 90 images of ngc 2506 were obtained in the course of the run , with total exposure times in minutes as follows : @xmath26 ( 19 ) @xmath27 ( 25 ) @xmath28 ( 57 ) @xmath29 ( 193 ) @xmath1 wide ( 26 ) @xmath1 narrow ( 97 ) @xmath25 ( 116 ) .",
    "field stars and clusters were observed at differing airmass to obtain extinction coefficients for all but the first night of the run .",
    "field star standards were observed on every photometric night , drawing from the catalogs of for strmgren and h@xmath1 standards , using @xcite for additional h@xmath1 standard values .",
    "the catalog of @xcite was the principal source for @xmath7 standards .",
    "additional observations were obtained in several open clusters used as secondary standards , including m67 @xcite , ngc 2516 @xcite and ngc 2287 @xcite .",
    "in general , the secondary standard cluster fields would be used to delineate the slopes and color terms for the calibration equations , relying on the field star standards to set calibration equation zero - points for each photometric night .",

    "flat field correction was accomplished using a master set of sky flats assembled over the course of the entire run .",

    "if internal standards are not available , final calibration of this precise set of magnitudes and indices must be anchored to airmass - corrected flux - based magnitudes of field star and cluster standards . to accommodate seeing variations , every aperture measurement used for calibration purposes",
    "is determined within an aperture radius set to five times the full width half maximum of the stars on that frame .",
    "similar measurements were obtained for a subset of the less crowded stars in ngc 2506 for each night , to facilitate the determination of aperture corrections .    using common slopes for each index , separate calibration equation zero - points may be determined for each relevant index for each photometric night .",

    "more critical is the separation of calibration equations for @xmath12 and @xmath6 for bluer , unevolved stars as opposed to cool giants and subgiants . aside from the challenge of determining these separate calibration equation segments , it is necessary to have some means of determining from uncalibrated photometry , to which class a star belongs . color alone",

    "the value of the detected variables lies in the fundamental stellar parameters they can supply through light curve analysis of the eclipsing variables and structural insights from asteroseismology of the single - star variables .",
    "while our ccd cluster frames have not been collected with a variable star search in mind , the relatively high precision of the final photometry leaves open the possibility of identifying larger amplitude and/or longer period systems through excessive dispersions among the indices or discrepant residuals in comparison with previous photometry . building upon the first approach , all stars with @xmath48 and a standard error of the mean in @xmath4 which implied larger than typical scatter at a given @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) were identified .",
    "stars with a reduced number of frames contributing to the index were eliminated since this indicated that the star was near the edge of the ccd field or suffered severe contamination from a nearby object .",
    "stars which showed significant scatter in only one filter but not both were removed , as were stars which showed normal errors in filters other than @xmath27 and @xmath26 , particularly h@xmath1 .",
    "this left a sample of 25 potential variables .",
    "each star was then checked visually on a high quality @xmath26 frame , after which 14 stars were excluded due to asymmetric psf s , implying contamination by an optical companion .",
    "of the 11 remaining stars , 6 lie within the area surveyed by @xcite and all 6 are known variables : v2 , v3 , v4 , v9 , v16 , and v26 .",
    "the list includes two oscillating blue stragglers , 3 eclipsing binaries , and 1 @xmath38 dor variable .",
    "given the success of the approach in identifying true variables within the well - studied cluster core , it is likely that the variables in the outer regions , members or not , are eclipsing binaries or stars within the main sequence instability strips .",
    "these stars are tagged within table 2 by a v designation after the calibration class , i.e. gv or bv .",

    "is well defined to @xmath8 @xmath22 17.5 , where increasing photometric scatter and the field star population with @xmath50 begin to dominate .",
    "the lack of scatter blueward of the main sequence is expected despite a distance of @xmath22 3 kpc for the cluster due to a galactic latitude near @xmath51 , coupled with a low line - of - sight reddening .",
    "the majority of contamination will come from foreground stars with only slightly smaller reddening than the cluster .",
    "on the giant branch , with the exception of the obvious red clump , the separation of cluster members from the field is a challenge , particularly within the scatter of redder stars brighter than the clump .    as a first step toward isolating the cluster from the field , we restrict the sample to the cluster core . using wide - field photometry @xcite on the @xmath52 system , @xcite mapped the radial distribution of stars in ngc 2506 , finding that the core radius varied as a function of the luminosity of the sample studied , ranging from 2.0  for the brighter stars to 6  for the lowest mass sample . for the entire dataset brighter than @xmath53",
    ", they found a core radius of 4 , which we will adopt for our core selection , shown in fig .",
    "3 , where symbols have the same meaning as in fig .",
    "the improvement is striking .",
    "while the unevolved main sequence is again obvious , the rich sample of stars above the turnoff between @xmath54 and 14.7 is almost certainly populated by binaries and a small sample of single stars evolving from the red hook to the subgiant branch .",
    "the scatter of stars redward of the main sequence is severely reduced and most of the scatter lies within 0.75 mag of the main sequence , implying a pattern defined by binaries .",
    "the subgiant branch is sparsely populated , but the path of the first - ascent red giants starting at the base near @xmath55 is discernible . equally important , the majority of the red giants above the clump are gone , an indication that most are likely non - members .    the dataset of fig .",
    "3 would be a solid starting point for analysis of the cluster parameters if no additional information were available .",
    "however , ngc 2506 has been the subject of a proper - motion analysis @xcite and 34 red giants in the cluster field have been surveyed for radial - velocity variations @xcite .",
    "we can therefore expand the probable cluster sample beyond the core , eliminate likely non - members throughout the ccd field , and cross - check the proper - motion membership for the giants against the radial - velocity predictions .",
    "the result of this more complicated approach is shown in fig .",
    "4 where only stars with errors in @xmath4 @xmath56 0.015 have been retained .",
    "note the reduction in the @xmath4 and @xmath8 range for the figure .",
    "black symbols denote stars within the cluster core with membership probabilities above 50% , while red symbols show stars that meet the same criterion but which fall outside the core .",
    "green symbols are stars within the core for which no proper - motion data are available , and crosses , red or black , are red giants with radial velocities consistent with the very high cluster value but non - zero proper - motion probabilities below 50%",
    ". as expected , the green points are responsible for the majority of the deviant points fainter than the subgiant branch , but the cluster members fall consistently within the band defined by the main sequence and the brighter limit of the binary sequence .",
    "with a base of probable cluster members with high - precision @xmath57 photometry in hand , we shift our focus to the stars at the cluster turnoff where the color range is optimally suited for analysis on the extended strmgren system .",
    "to reduce any potential distortions caused by evolution well off of the main sequence and contamination by highly probable binaries which populate the vertical band of stars above the turnoff between @xmath8 = 13.75 and 14.75 , we eliminate any stars brighter than @xmath8 = 14.8 .",
    "we then eliminate all stars which have photometric errors in @xmath12 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and h@xmath1 greater than 0.020 , 0.030 , 0.020 , and 0.015 mag , respectively .",
    "this imposes an effective cutoff on the sample near @xmath8 = 16.70 . finally , we narrow the color range to stars with @xmath4 between 0.20 and 0.60 , leaving a sample of 332 stars , plotted in fig . 5 .",
    "while some stars scatter well to the red of the main sequence because they are either field stars or giants near the base of the giant branch , the dominant scatter appears to be caused by the cluster binary sequence extending parallel to but brighter than the normal turnoff .",
    "given the relatively high precision of the @xmath4 indices , we can eliminate a large fraction of these stars by tagging any stars which lie off the mean relation by more than @xmath220.035 mag .",
    "stars plotted as red crosses in fig .",
    "5 have been tagged as meeting this criterion .",
    "a pair of stars which lie blueward of the mean relation are plotted as blue squares .",
    "note that the number of red points effectively disappears near the turnoff above @xmath8 = 15.6 ; the binary sequence should merge with the single - star sequence near this region of the cmd , making identification of the binaries impossible using this simple technique .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath58 cmd as a test of our sample selection and as a means to eliminate additional non - members .",
    "the use of @xmath7 is valuable for three reasons .",
    "first , for a fixed metallicity , @xmath7 is much more sensitive to temperature changes than @xmath4 for mid - f stars and cooler .",
    "stars which are truly cooler at a given @xmath8 compared to the mean cluster relation , either because they are binaries shifted vertically relative to single stars in the cmd or field stars , will exhibit a measurable shift in @xmath7 .",
    "second , @xmath7 is one - sixth as sensitive to reddening as @xmath4 and shifts the star to bluer / smaller @xmath7 values .",
    "stars which are unusually reddened in the @xmath49 cmd will remain virtually unchanged or appear bluer in the @xmath58 diagram .",
    "third , of special importance to ngc 2506 where the turnoff stars are late a / early f spectral types with very similar @xmath7 indices over a range in @xmath4 , @xmath7 is extremely sensitive to small changes in metallicity .",
    "ngc 2506 is predicted to be metal - deficient by 0.2 to 0.3 dex relative to the sun . if the foreground field stars along the line of sight are typical of the solar neighborhood , they should easily separate from the cluster sample by an amount which is three to five times larger than the photometric errors .    fig . 6",
    "shows the cmd with the same symbols as fig . 5 , plus one additional class .",
    "black crosses are stars which deviate significantly from the cluster sequence in @xmath7 at a given @xmath8 magnitude which were not tagged in fig .",
    "the almost vertical band defined by the hot stars at the turnoff of ngc 2506 is readily apparent , with a scatter at a fixed @xmath8 consistent with the restricted photometric error limits attached to the sample selection .",
    "as hoped , the general pattern is that the stars which lie redward of the cluster sequence in fig .",
    "5 ( red crosses ) reproduce a similar trend in fig .",
    "6 . there are , however , 18 stars which were not identified as being deviant in fig . 5 which appear to be so in fig . 6 ; the majority of these are possible binaries or , more likely , field stars which have significantly higher [ fe / h ] than the cluster but happen to superpose on the cluster @xmath49 cmd due to a difference in absolute magnitude .",
    "it should be noted that for a metal - deficient cluster , a similar selection criterion could be built upon the @xmath12 index , with metal - rich field stars having a larger @xmath12 value at a given @xmath8 . for comparable photometric precision , however , the expected change in @xmath12 would be 3 - 4 times smaller , making it difficult to distinguish between the impact of metallicity and photometric errors .    with all stars plotted as crosses in fig .",
    "6 eliminated , the photometric reddening and metallicity can be derived . for details on the approach ,",
    "the reader is referred to a subset of the several past investigations where it has been applied @xcite . the simultaneous solution for [ fe / h ] and",
    "@xmath59 based upon @xmath12 and h@xmath1 for 257 stars is @xmath60 ( sem ) and @xmath61 ( sem ) ( @xmath11 , respectively , independent of the standard relation adopted for the strmgren indices @xcite . with the reddening set , the metallicity based upon @xmath7 , h@xmath1 is [ fe / h ] @xmath62 ( sem ) . for a change in @xmath59 of @xmath16 ( @xmath63 ) , [ fe / h]@xmath64 changes by @xmath65 while [ fe / h]@xmath66 changes by only @xmath67 dex . for an uncertainty of @xmath68 in the zero - points of the @xmath12 and @xmath7 indices , the changes in [ fe / h ] are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the weighted mean of the two abundances is clearly dominated by @xmath7 , leading to [ fe / h ] @xmath15 , where the error estimate includes both internal and potential systematic errors .",
    "the red giants are often ignored in discussions of the reddening on the traditional strmgren system because h@xmath1 becomes insensitive to changes in temperature among cooler stars , approaching a limiting index near 2.56 for increasing @xmath4 ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "with the addition of @xmath7 , the giants take on added significance because of the very weak reddening dependence of the @xmath7 index coupled to a temperature dependence which is 2.5 times more sensitive than @xmath4 .",
    "to illustrate the point , in fig .",
    "7 we plot all the red giants of fig .",
    "4 with the same color ( black ) irrespective of location in the cluster field ; black crosses are still giants identified as probable members based upon radial velocity , independent of the proper - motion membership probability .",
    "the blue line is the relation drawn defined only by the cluster members .",
    "the residuals about the mean relation have a dispersion of @xmath340.010 mag . from the quoted photometric errors",
    ", the dispersion is predicted to be @xmath340.004 @xmath34 0.002 mag . since all the stars",
    "should have the same metallicity , and reddening effects on @xmath7 are six times smaller and in the opposite direction to the effects on @xmath4 , the dispersion in @xmath4 at a given @xmath7 should provide an indication of the size of the reddening spread across the face of the cluster .",
    "the upper limit on the spread in @xmath59 becomes @xmath68 mag .",
    "considering that the quoted errors on the photometry are likely lower limits , that binaries and other giants with potential spectroscopic anomalies have not been eliminated , that giants at a given @xmath7 may be first - ascent , red - clump , or asymptotic giant branch stars where surface gravity changes may affect the color indices , we place a conservative upper limit to the reddening variation across the face of the cluster at @xmath340.007 for @xmath59 or @xmath340.01 @xmath71 , i.e. effectively 0.0 .    with the relation for cluster members well - defined , we can now add to fig .",
    "7 all stars outside the cluster core for which proper - motion and radial - velocity information is absent ( red crosses ) .",
    "the large scatter of points away from and above the relation for the cluster confirms that the majority of these are field giants , likely background giants with higher reddening and likely lower metallicity than the cluster .",
    "there are , however , approximately two dozen stars which have positions consistent with cluster parameters , dominated by a rich concentration of a dozen stars at the colors of the clump ( @xmath72 @xmath22 ( 1.0 , 0.6 ) .",
    "further observation and analysis of these candidates could add insight to the already rich red giant population of ngc 2506 .",
    "our entire analysis is based upon strmgren photometry , so for consistency with our recent analysis of ngc 752 @xcite , we turn to the victoria - regina isochrones @xcite for simultaneous age and distance estimation . fig .",
    "8 shows the data of fig .",
    "4 with the isochrones for ages 1.7 , 1.8 , and 1.9 gyr and [ fe / h ] @xmath73 , the closest abundance to the derived metallicity of the cluster , superposed .",
    "the adopted best - fit , apparent modulus , assuming @xmath59 = 0.042 is @xmath74 = 12.75 .",
    "the matches to the turnoff , subgiant , and giant branches are very good to excellent for an age between 1.8 and 1.9 gyr . for the giant branch ,",
    "it is intriguing to note that while the sequence below the level of the clump fits the observations well , the few stars brighter than the clump all lie at significantly brighter positions than implied by the isochrones , leading to the conclusion that these stars are binaries and/or asymptotic giant branch members of the cluster .",
    "the impact of the difference between the true [ fe / h ] and the isochrone value is small enough to ignore for the age estimate , though a more metal - poor isochrone would produce a slightly older age . with respect to the distance modulus , the more metal - rich main sequence overestimates the modulus by less than 0.03 mag , well within the uncertainties posed by variations in the reddening and the transformation of the isochrones from the theoretical plane to the observational .      since the direct measurement of @xmath71 for ngc 2506 using ddo photometry of 7 red giants in the field of the cluster @xcite produced 0.052 @xmath34 0.016",
    ", it has been clear that the cluster reddening is small .",
    "the reddening maps of @xcite , revising the earlier work of @xcite , produce @xmath71 = 0.074 in the direction of the cluster , confirming a modest reddening even at large distance , primarily due to the large galactic latitude .",
    "later investigations have adopted @xmath75 to 0.08 @xcite , derived values between 0.0 and 0.07 using isochrone fits which depend on the adopted [ fe / h ] @xcite , or made direct determinations from multicolor photometry ( @xmath76 , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite used spectroscopic temperatures coupled with photometry to obtain @xmath77 from 4 giants , a value adopted by @xcite and @xcite . in summary , accounting for ngc 2506 s metal deficiency , the previously published values obtained by spectroscopic , photometric , and/or cmd analysis are consistent with @xmath71 = 0.055 @xmath34 0.020 , in agreement with the value derived here . equally important ,",
    "changing the reddening by @xmath59 = @xmath340.015 ( @xmath71 = @xmath340.02 ) would alter the derived cluster age by less than @xmath780.1 gyr .",
    "metallicity comparisons can be challenging given the often different assumptions for reddening and for the zero - point of the metallicity scale upon which the measurement is based .",
    "the first direct metallicity estimate for ngc 2506 was based on a combination of ddo red giant photometry and @xmath79 photometry of both red giants and turnoff stars , leading to [ fe / h ] @xmath80 _ relative to the hyades _ , which defined the standard relations adopted in the analysis @xcite . if [ fe / h ] for the hyades is assumed to be + 0.12 , this implied a cluster mean of @xmath81 .",
    "we note that values as high as + 0.18 have been derived in recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . for reference , a virtually identical approach using the same calibration relations on ngc 752 @xcite led to [ fe / h ] _ relative to the hyades _ of @xmath82 , making it 0.20 dex more metal - rich than ngc 2506 .",
    "the ddo system was later recalibrated @xcite but , not surprisingly , while the absolute scale shifted slightly , the differential offset remained basically the same , with [ fe / h ] @xmath83 and @xmath84 for ngc 2506 and ngc 752 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the first spectroscopic work on ngc 2506 was the moderate - resolution spectroscopy of @xcite , who derived [ fe / h ] @xmath85 on a scale where ngc 752 had [ fe / h ] @xmath86 .",
    "this data set was revisited and recalibrated by @xcite , who derived [ fe / h ] @xmath87 and @xmath88 for ngc 2506 and ngc 752 .",
    "the moderate - resolution spectroscopic data were expanded and recalibrated by @xcite , producing [ fe / h ] @xmath89 and @xmath90 for ngc 2506 and ngc 752 .",
    "the often overlooked aspect of this final revision is that the definition of the metallicity scale included the clusters m67 and ngc 2420 as standards , assumed to have input [ fe / h ] @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , and generating derived values for these two clusters of @xmath93 and @xmath94 . the clear consensus from the photometric and moderate - dispersion spectroscopy is that ngc 2506 lies 0.20 to 0.30 dex below ngc 752 in [ fe / h ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , high - dispersion spectroscopic abundances within ngc 2506 are few and far between .",
    "@xcite analyzed 4 giants with an unweighted average of [ fe / h ] @xmath95 ( sd ) . restricting the sample to only two clump giants , this became [ fe / h]@xmath96 ( sd )",

    "unfortunately , a check of the potential sources for these age estimates shows that most are outdated , of poor quality , and/or repetitions of values from other catalogs .",
    "an often - repeated source for the age of ngc 2506 is the listing in webda at 1.1 gyr ( log t = 9.045 ) , despite the fact that no isochrone fit to the cluster has at any time in the last 35 years generated an age this small .",
    "this anomalously low value has been propagated through other catalogs such as @xcite , just to name a few . even using basic cmd morphological parameters @xcite to determine age",
    ", ngc 2506 always occupies a position intermediate in age between ngc 752 and m67 and above 1.5 gyr .    following",
    "the original discussion by @xcite , the first attempt to determine the age of ngc 2506 using isochrones incorporating convective overshoot mixing is that of @xcite . with @xmath71 and [ fe / h ]",
    "set at 0.08 and @xmath100 , they derived an age of 1.9 gyr and an apparent modulus of @xmath101 . if we lower the reddening to 0.058 and raise the metallicity to @xmath102 , the effects on the distance modulus mostly cancel , leading to an increase in @xmath74 to just above 12.8 . likewise , lowering the reddening increases the age while raising the metallicity causes it to drop ; without more details on the specific isochrones , the net change is impossible to estimate precisely .",
    "@xcite explored a range of models and cluster parameters , where the exact values of optimum distance , reddening , age and metallicity varied with the isochrones under discussion .",
    "however , the optimal set of ages and distances ranged from 1.5 to 2.2 gyr and @xmath103 to 12.7 for all plausible choices of reddening and metallicity .",
    "@xcite used @xmath71 = 0.04 and isochrones with convective overshoot mixing at [ fe / h ] @xmath104 to derive @xmath105 and an age of 1.9 gyr .",

    "the higher metallicity would also boost the distance modulus and slightly decrease the age .",
    "finally , @xcite have used unpublished @xmath52 photometry to obtain an optimal isochrone match for [ fe / h ] @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 and an age of 2.31 gyr . raising the reddening and lowering",
    "the metallicity will lead to opposite effects on the age and distance modulus .",
    "no plausible shift in metallicity and/or reddening can bring this age estimate into agreement with the results of fig.7 .",

    "the exact age and metallicity , critical for coherent interpretation of the evolutionary trends among the stars as revealed by their surface parameters and elemental abundances , have generally converged over the last 20 years toward an age between 1.7 and 2.0 gyr and a metallicity between 0.2 and 0.3 dex less than the better - studied cluster ngc 752 .",
