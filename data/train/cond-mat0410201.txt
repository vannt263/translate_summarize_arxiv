    "in the past few years considerable attention has been devoted to the investigations of magnetism in small nano - sized ferromagnetic particles .",
    "such interest is caused by the opportunities for creating recording devices@xcite@xmath0@xcite and ultrasmall magnetic field sensors@xcite based on the properties of ferromagnetic particles .",
    "it is now well - understood that magnetization distribution in a single particle is determined by the competition between the magnetostatic and exchange energies . if a particle is small , it is uniformly magnetized and if its size is large enough a non - uniform(vortex ) magnetization is more energy preferable(see , for example , refs .",
    ", , , ) . besides the geometrical form and size , the state of the particle depends on many other factors .",
    "for example , by applying a homogeneous magnetic field we can cause nucleation or annihilation of the vortex . in an array of particles",
    "their magnetostatic interaction may have a strong influence on a particle magnetization . if the distance between particles is rather small then magnetostatic interaction has a strong destabilizing effect on the vortex state , leading to a significant decrease in both the nucleation and annihilation fields @xcite@xmath1@xcite .",
    "the interplay between the ferromagnetism and superconductivity can also lead to changes in the magnetization distribution .",
    "it was shown that in a ferromagnetic film put on a superconducting substrate the size of the domains is up to @xmath2 times smaller than for a film without a superconducting substrate@xcite@xmath1@xcite .",
    "the experimental investigations revealed changes in the magnetic field around al / ni submicron structures with a decrease in the temperature to values below @xmath3 .",
    "this effect was referred to the expulsion of the magnetic field by the superconducting part of the ferromagnetic / superconductor ( fs ) hybrid structures@xcite .",
    "all investigations of the fs interaction deal with the changes of the ferromagnetic domain structure .",
    "therefore the results thereof can not be applied to the single - domain nanoparticles . on the one hand ,",
    "the magnetization of a nanoparticle is more simple than the domain structure of a macroscopic ferromagnetic , therefore , theoretical findings could be proved by experiments with nanoparticles .",
    "but on the other hand , the magnitude of the interaction between the nanoparticles and the superconductor is strongly reduced due to the large values of the london penetration depth .    in this work",
    "we investigate the phase transition between the single - domain and the vortex state , and the process of magnetization reversal of a ferromagnetic nano - sized particle placed above the surface of a superconductor .",
    "the superconducting state is described using the london approximation , that is , we assume that the particle can not produce a vortex- antivortex pair .",
    "this assumption is not universally true , since if the particle dimensions are sufficiently large its magnetic field can destroy the meijssner state of the superconductor@xcite .",
    "the criteria of the london approximation applicability can be obtained in the following way .",
    "the largest magnetic field is generated by a single - domain particle .",
    "then , the maximal magnetic flux through the surface of a superconductor is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the radius and the height of the particle and m is the magnetization .",
    "the flux @xmath7 must be less than the flux quantum @xmath8 in order to exclude the possibility of a vortex penetration .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic particle with a saturation magnetization of about @xmath9 .",
    "then we have the following limitation on the particle dimensions : @xmath10 .",
    "so we consider only the particles which obey this condition .",
    "the equilibrium distribution of magnetization which gives a minimum to the energy functional is found by numerical simulation .",
    "for numerical simulation we use the approach based on the landau - lifshitz - gilbert(llg ) equation for the dynamics of magnetic moments .",
    "this approach enables us to investigate metastable states which realize the local minimums of the energy functional .",
    "the metastable states are of great importance since the finiteness of the nucleation and annihilation fields values is the consequence of the energy barrier between single - domain and vortex - like states .",
    "we obtain a phase diagram of the particle in the height / diameter plane for the transition from the single - domain to the vortex - like state .",
    "we find that for the realistic value of the london penetration depth the fs interaction is rather weak .",
    "the energy of the fs interaction is about 100 times smaller than the self energy of the particle .",
    "therefore , the fs interaction has no influence on the phase diagram .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetization curve of the particle in an external homogeneous magnetic field changes significantly .",
    "even the 1/100 energy shift means that the superconducting screening current produces a magnetic field of about @xmath11 which leads to experimentally observable decrease of the vortex nucleation field and increase of the annihilation field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we derive the analytical expression for the energy functional of our system . in sec.3",
    "we show the most important features of the numerical simulation . in sec.4",
    "we discuss the results and also propose possible experiments .",
    "finally , the summary is given in sec.5 .",
    "the system we consider is a ferromagnetic particle placed above the surface of a superconductor ( fig.[particle ] ) .",
    "we assume that the superconductor occupies the whole half - space , so it has only one boundary plane , @xmath12 .",
    "the ferromagnetic particle is assumed to be made of soft magnetic material , so the energy of anisotrophy is equal to zero .",
    "the total energy of the system of particle and superconductor reads :    @xmath13    the first term @xmath14 is the energy of the exchange interaction :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the constant of exchange interaction .",
    "the second term @xmath17 in eq.([energy0 ] ) is the magnetostatic energy@xcite :    @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the sum of magnetic field @xmath20 induced by the particle and magnetic field @xmath21 generated by the superconducting current : @xmath22 the last term @xmath23 in eq.([energy0 ] ) is the energy of the interaction between the magnetic moment and the external field @xmath24 : @xmath25    in order to obtain the energy as the functional of @xmath26 we should express the magnetic field @xmath19 in terms of @xmath26 . to this end we should solve the maxwell - london equations where the source is a magnetic current @xmath27 .    in the space outside the superconductor",
    "the system is described by the following equations :    @xmath28    @xmath29    where we introduce the vector of magnetic induction @xmath30 .",
    "the superconductor is described by the equations :    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the superconducting current and @xmath34 is the london penetration depth . for the boundary conditions we take the continuity of the magnetic induction @xmath35 and its derivatives at the boundary plane @xmath12 .",
    "since the maxwell - london equations are linear , we first can consider a single magnetic dipole placed at the point @xmath36 above the surface of the superconductor : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "once this problem is solved , we can construct the solution for any magnetization distribution .",
    "after a bit troublesome but straightforward computation , we obtain the solution to the single - dipole problem at the half - space @xmath39 in the form : @xmath40 where the magnetic potential @xmath41 is :    @xmath42    the first term @xmath43 in eq.([s_pot ] ) is the potential of a single magnetic dipole without a superconductor : @xmath44 the second term @xmath45 is the potential of the magnetic dipole reflected at the plane @xmath12 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 the third term @xmath49 in eq.([s_pot ] ) appears due to the finiteness of the london penetration depth value @xmath34 .",
    "the expression for @xmath49 is :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the bessel function",
    ". then the single dipole magnetic field above the surface of the superconductor is expressed as :    @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the modified dipole matrix :    @xmath58    here the first term is an ordinary dipole matrix : @xmath59 and the second term appears due to the presence of the superconductor    @xmath60 where indexes @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote coordinates @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the kroneker s symbol .",
    "let us now consider continuous distribution of the magnetic moment @xmath65 .",
    "the magnetic field generated by the superconducting current is given as a sum of single - dipole solutions :    @xmath66 for the magnetic field @xmath20 generated by the magnetic current we can not take the sum of the single - dipole fields since the dipole matrix @xmath67 has a nonintegrable singularity at point @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the expression for @xmath20 that we use is :    @xmath69 @xmath70 here , @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the volume and surface of a particle and @xmath73 is the unit vector of the external normal to the surface at a current point .",
    "finally , we consider the energy functional consisting of the self - energy of particle @xmath74 , the energy of interaction with the superconductor @xmath75 and with external field @xmath23 : @xmath76 self - energy @xmath74 includes exchange @xmath77 energy and the part @xmath78 of magnetostatic energy @xmath79 :    @xmath80 where @xmath81    @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 the energy of interaction @xmath75 of the particle with the superconductor is the energy of the magnetic moment in the field produced by the superconducting current , and it is the other part of the magnetostatic energy @xmath79 :    @xmath85 @xmath86 the energy @xmath23 is the same as in eq.([energy0 ] ) and is given by eq.([ext_energy ] ) .",
    "to perform numerical calculation we use the same approach as in refs . and .",
    "the basis of our numerical simulation is the llg equation for magnetization * m*(*r*,t ) of a particle in the form @xmath87-",
    "\\frac{\\alpha\\gamma}{(1+\\alpha^2)m_s}[{\\bf{m}},[{\\bf{m}},{\\bf{h}}_{eff}]],\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath89 is the dimensionless damping parameter and @xmath90 is time . the effective field @xmath91 is a variation derivative of the energy functional :    @xmath92    the important feature of the llg equation is that it describes the evolution of the magnetization distribution to the equilibrium . by varying the initial conditions we find different equilibrium states of our system .",
    "then we choose the equilibrium state with the minimal energy to obtain the ground state .",
    "choosing as the initial state the vortex - like or single - domain distribution and varying the external field @xmath24 we determine the vortex annihilation or nucleation field as the critical field of transformation of the vortex - like to single - domain state or vice versa .    to avoid a three - dimensional grid problem to be solved which needs large computer resources",
    "we assume that magnetization of a cylindrical particle does not depend on the coordinate @xmath93 along the cylindrical axis .",
    "then we integrate the relations for the energy over @xmath93 and @xmath94 and obtain the energy as a functional of the magnetization which is a function of only two space variables .",
    "then we define the effective field @xmath91 as a variation derivative of the obtained functional .",
    "the effective field does not depend on @xmath93 either , so we have a three - dimensional problem reduced to the two - dimensional one .    to develop a numerical method we divide the particle into rectangular parallelepipeds with a square base of size @xmath95 in the plane @xmath96 and of height @xmath6 and obtain approximate expressions for different parts of the energy functional using the grid values of magnetization @xmath97 .",
    "the expression for the magnetostatic energy @xmath78 reads :    @xmath98=-\\frac{a^4}{2}\\sum_{\\rho\\neq{\\rho } ' }    { \\bf{m}}({\\rho}')\\cdot\\hat{\\bf{d}}_d^h(\\rho-{\\rho}'){\\bf{m}}(\\rho)+e_d^0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath99 are the points of the square grid with step @xmath95 on the @xmath96 plane and matrix @xmath100 is the dipole matrix @xmath101 integrated over the @xmath93 coordinate : @xmath102 the additional term @xmath103 in eq.([approximate_magnetostatic energy ] ) appears as the contribution of self - interaction in the cell .",
    "it depends only on the value of magnetization which is assumed constant , so it does not influence the effective field .",
    "the expression for the exchange energy reads : @xmath104=-\\frac{jh}{2m_s^2}\\sum_{\\rho}\\sum_{{\\rho } ' }   |{\\bf{m}}({\\bf{\\rho}})-{\\bf{m}}({\\bf{\\rho}}')|^2.\\ ] ] the internal summation in eq.([approximate_exchange energy ] ) is taken over all neighbors @xmath105 of the point @xmath106 .",

    ". on one hand the size of the cell should be smaller than the characteristic exchange interaction length ( @xmath111 ) in order to describe the inhomogeneous magnetization correctly .",
    "on the other hand , we can not choose it very small because of the computation time limitations .",
    "for computation we choose the following parameters : the saturation magnetization @xmath112 , the exchange interaction constant @xmath113 .",
    "the cell size is @xmath114 , while the exchange interaction length is approximately @xmath115 .",
    "the distance @xmath116 and the london penetration depth have a strong influence on the interaction between a particle and a superconductor . for superconductors with @xmath117 the interaction should be largely reduced , since such values of @xmath34 are comparable to the size of the particle . to compensate for this reduction we can make the distance @xmath116 small .",
    "we choose @xmath118 and @xmath119 since such values are experimentally obtainable and make the effect of a particle - superconductor interaction quite distinctive .",
    "first of all , we investigate how the energy of the interaction between the particle and the superconductor depends on the value of @xmath34 .",
    "we calculate the interaction energy @xmath75 for the particle with a single - domain and vortex - like magnetization(fig.[energy ] ) .",
    "the dimensions of the particle are : @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the self - energy of this particle is @xmath122 for the single domain state and @xmath123 for the vortex one .",
    "the interaction energy decreases rapidly when @xmath34 changes from @xmath124 to @xmath125 . for larger values of @xmath34",
    "the interaction energy tends to zero asymptotically . at practically interesting values @xmath117",
    "the interaction energy is about @xmath126 for the single - domain magnetization and @xmath127 for the vortex - like magnetization .",
    "thus the interaction with a superconductor is much stronger for a single - domain particle .",
    "this is easily understood because the vortex - like magnetization produces a much weaker magnetic field than the single - domain magnetization .",
    "the interaction energy for the real values of @xmath128 is much smaller than the particle self energy : for the single - domain magnetization it is @xmath129 .    .",
    "]    then we study the ground state of the particle interacting with the superconductor .",
    "we define the ground state as a stable state with the lowest energy .",
    "there are two possible stable states for the particle : vortex - like and single - domain states .",
    "we obtain a phase diagram ( see fig.[diagram ] ) where in the area above the phase boundary the ground state is vortex - like and below the boundary it is single - domain .",
    "different curves on fig.[diagram ] correspond to different values of @xmath34 .",
    ", open circles- @xmath130 , triangles- @xmath131 , rhombus- @xmath132 . ]",
    "each phase boundary on fig.[diagram ] has basic properties coming from the origin of phase transitions in a ferromagnetic nanoparticle@xcite .",
    "they are determined by the interplay between the magnetostatic and exchange energy . in relatively large particles",
    "the ground state is vortex - like .",
    "when the dimensions(diameter @xmath133 or height @xmath6 ) of the particle are reduced then the single domain state becomes the ground one .",
    "the superconductor influence shows up through an enlargement of the area of small - sized particles having the vortex - like state .",
    "it is clear that the shift of the phase boundary in comparison to the case @xmath134 depends on the ratio of the interaction energy to the self - energy of the single - domain particle : @xmath135 .",
    "since this ratio is very small @xmath136 at @xmath137 , the phase boundary remains almost unchanged .",
    "but the phase boundary between the two ground states is not important because at the large area around this curve on the phase diagram both the single domain and the vortex - like states are stable .",
    "when we cross the phase boundary from a large size to a smaller one , the vortex - like state becomes metastable , i.e. , it is not the ground state but it does not transform to the single - domain state .",
    "this is also true for the single - domain state .",
    "the example of the area of metastability is shown on fig.[metastability ] .",
    "thus it is more important to investigate the boundary between the area of metastability and the absolute instability of the vortex - like or the single - domain state .",
    "this boundary depends on the external magnetic field @xmath138 .",
    "it was found out that applying the in - plane field @xmath138 we can cause nucleation of the vortex , i.e. , make the single - domain state unstable , annihilation of the vortex , i.e. make the vortex - like state unstable@xcite . practically , it is more convenient to vary the external magnetic field than the dimensions of the particle .",
    "that is why we investigate the vortex annihilation , @xmath139 ( fig.[ann ] ) and nucleation , @xmath140 ( fig.[nucl ] ) fields as functions of particle diameter @xmath133 .",
    "the height of the particle is fixed : @xmath141 .     of vortex annihilation as a function of diameter @xmath133 .",
    "the height of the particle @xmath141 .",
    "the curve marked with filled circles is for @xmath142 , with open circles- for @xmath143 . ]     of vortex nucleation as a function of diameter @xmath133 .",
    "the height of the particle @xmath141 .",
    "the curve marked with filled circles is for @xmath142 , with empty circles- for @xmath143 . ]",
    "the nucleation and annihilation of the vortex are parts of the process of magnetization reversal in a particle driven by the external magnetic field .",
    "if the particle is initially found in the single - domain state , then by applying external field @xmath144 in the opposite to the magnetic moment direction we first stimulate a transition to the vortex - like state , i.e. , nucleation of the vortex . when we increase the external field further , the vortex annihilates and the particle comes to the single - domain state again but with a reversed magnetic moment .",
    "note that the annihilation field @xmath139 as always positive for the particle with @xmath141 ( see fig.[ann ] ) .",
    "the nucleation field @xmath140 becomes negative when the diameter @xmath133 is large enough(see fig.[nucl ] ) .",
    "this means that the single domain state is unstable and the external field should be applied in order to prevent the nucleation of the vortex - like state . in more detail",
    "we investigate the magnetization reversal for a particle of @xmath145 and height @xmath141 . at the zero field",
    "the particle is in the single - domain state with an average magnetic moment directed along the @xmath146 axis .",
    "the external field is applied in the opposite direction to the initial magnetic moment .",
    "the magnetization curve for this particle is shown on fig.[magn_curve+](1 ) .",
    "this curve describes the dependence of the average @xmath146-component of the magnetic moment @xmath147 on the external magnetic field .",
    "the distribution of magnetization at the stages of the magnetization reversal process is shown on fig.[magn_curve+](2 ) .",
    "( open circles ) and @xmath132 ( filled circles ) .",
    "the particle dimensions are @xmath141 , @xmath145 , ( a),(d)-single - domain states , ( b),(c)-vortex - like state . ( 2 ) the evolution of magnetization distribution during the process of magnetization reversal . ]    the influence of a superconductor shows up in the reduced value of the average magnetic moment , because it decreases the interaction energy @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the nucleation field for the particle placed above the superconductor is smaller and the annihilation field is larger than for the particle in the absence of superconductor .",
    "the difference between these fields increases with the size of the particle(see fig.[ann ] , [ nucl ] ) .",
    "when the diameter is quite large : @xmath148 , the shift of the nucleation and annihilation fields is about @xmath149 . as we have noted before",
    ", this shift should be of order of the field produced by the superconducting current @xmath150 . to verify our results we find @xmath151 averaged over the @xmath93 coordinate : @xmath152 .",
    "for an example we take a single - domain particle with @xmath153 and @xmath141 . on fig.[magn_field](a),(b),(c ) we show the components of @xmath151 inside the particle .",
    "the magnetic field is normalized to the saturation magnetization @xmath112 .",
    ", @xmath154 , @xmath155 of the magnetic field produced by the superconducting current .",
    "( d)-magnetization of the particle .",
    "@xmath156 , @xmath141 , @xmath157 . ]",
    "the x - component of magnetic field @xmath151 is the largest and it varies from @xmath158 at the center of the particle to @xmath159 at the edges . thus @xmath160 and @xmath161 should be about @xmath162 .",
    "according to the results of simulation , the shift of the nucleation field for the cylindrical particle with @xmath156 is @xmath163(see fig.[nucl ] ) and the shift of the annihilation field is @xmath164(see fig.[ann ] ) .",
    "therefore , our estimation gives the right order of @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "let us now consider some possible experimental investigations based on the effects which we have described . placing a ferromagnetic particle with diameter @xmath167 and height @xmath141 above the superconductor and cooling it below its critical temperature @xmath3 we will have well observable shifts @xmath160 and @xmath165 of about @xmath168 .",
    "moreover , the shift of the annihilation field @xmath165 enables us to realize a selective magnetization reversal in an array of ferromagnetic particles placed above the superconductor .",
    "if we neglect the interparticle interaction , then the magnetization curve of each particle is like the one shown on fig.[magn_curve+ ] .",
    "let us assume that initially all particles in the array are in the vortex - like state .",
    "applying the magnetic field of magnitude between @xmath169 and @xmath170(see fig.[experiment](1 ) ) will lead to a reversible displacement of the vortex core within each particle ( see fig.[experiment](2a ) ) .",
    "if then we destroy the superconductivity around one of the particles , it will immediately fall into the single - domain state ( see fig.[experiment](2b ) ) .",
    "by removing the magnetic field we will have all particles get back to the initial state except for the one which will remain in the single - domain state .",
    "thus we can operate with a single particle in an array without disturbing the state of other particles .",
    "we presented the results of the numerical investigation of the magnetization reversal process in an external magnetic field of a ferromagnetic particle placed above the surface of a superconductor .",
    "the numerical simulation is based on solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation for the dynamics of magnetic moment .",
    "the superconductor is in the meijssner state and the only parameter that affects the interaction between the particle and the superconductor is the london penetration depth @xmath34 .",
    "we have shown that for a realistic value of @xmath132 the interaction energy is much smaller than the self - energy of the particle and the ground state of the particles does not change significantly . but nevertheless , the magnetic field generated by the superconducting current leads to a decrease of the nucleation field and to an increase of the annihilation field by @xmath168 .",
    "based on the effect of the annihilation field shift when the superconductor is cooled to temperatures below @xmath3 we describe the method of a selective magnetization reversal in an array of ferromagnetic particles .",
