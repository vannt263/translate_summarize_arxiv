    "in this note , we investigate littlewood - paley - decompositions and associated scales of besov spaces on simply connected , connected stratified lie groups . previous definitions of homogeneous and non - homogeneous besov and sobolev spaces mostly relied on the spectral theory of a sub - laplacian operator @xcite . briefly , a dyadic partition of unity of the positive half line is translated via the spectral calculus of the sub - laplacian to yield a littlewood - paley - decomposition of functions and tempered distributions of the underlying group .",
    "besov spaces are then defined in terms of @xmath1-norms of the terms in the littlewood - paley decomposition .",
    "an alternative approach used the action of the heat semigroup associated to the sub - laplacian , which may be interpreted as a continuous - scale littlewood - paley or continuous wavelet decomposition .",
    "while the connection between smoothness spaces and spectral theory is well established ( see e.g. @xcite ) , one definite drawback is that a priori , it is hard to tell to which extent these spaces depend on the choice of the sub - laplacian .",
    "since two such sub - laplacians can not be expected to commute , it seems very difficult to relate their spectral measures in any meaningful way .",
    "accordingly , the existing proofs that besov or sobolev spaces associated to a sub - laplacian are independent of the choice of sub - laplacian ( and thus , inherent to the group rather than to the operator ) , are quite subtle and technical , and they usually employ alternative characterizations of the spaces .",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "also , many of the previous sources simply did not address the issue of independence of the choice of sub - laplacian , at least not explicitly .",
    "for instance , in @xcite independence can be concluded for certain inhomogeneous besov spaces from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 12 ) characterizing these spaces in terms of moduli of continuity .    in this paper , a more general approach is taken , which we now roughly sketch .",
    "we consider general littlewood - paley - decompositions of tempered distributions of the type @xmath2 here , @xmath3 are obtained from suitable @xmath4 via dyadic dilations : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes a dilation operator naturally associated to the stratified lie group @xmath0 . the convergence in the decomposition is required to hold in the schwartz topology , for all schwartz functions @xmath7 with all moments vanishing .",
    "note that such decompositions are usually constructed in the above - mentioned way from a sub - laplacian ; in fact , it is the only general construction procedure for littlewood - paley - type decompositions that we are currently aware of .",
    "then , for @xmath8 , the besov semi - norms associated to @xmath9 are defined as @xmath10 we let @xmath11 denote the space of all @xmath12 ( the quotient space modulo polynomials ) for which this is finite .",
    "our chief result , theorem [ thm : main ] , then states that , under very mild and intuitive conditions on the functions @xmath13 , the semi - norms and associated spaces do not depend on the littlewood - paley decomposition . as a corollary",
    ", these spaces coincide with the besov spaces associated to sub - laplacians , regardless of the precise choice of the sub - laplacian . in particular , the latter are indeed independent of the choice of sub - laplacian .",
    "the final result , theorem [ thm : main_2 ] considers continuous littlewood - paley or wavelet decompositions , showing e.g. for @xmath14 , @xmath15 here , the restrictions on the analysing window @xmath9 can be further weakened .",
    "in particular , the admissible wavelets constructed in @xcite are all available for the characterization of besov spaces as well , provided they have sufficiently many vanishing moments .",
    "@xmath0 always denotes a simply connected , connected stratified lie group with lie algebra @xmath16 .",
    "our source of reference for standard definitions and facts that are not explicitly mentioned in the following is @xcite .. since @xmath0 is exponential , we identify @xmath0 with @xmath16 as a set , and endow the latter with the campbell - hausdorff product ; under this identification , the exponential map is just the identity map . left and right haar measure on @xmath0",

    "<S> we introduce a general definition of homogeneous besov spaces on a stratified lie group @xmath0 , based on a littlewood - paley - type decomposition of schwartz functions with all moments vanishing . </S>",
    "<S> we show that under mild and intuitive conditions the spaces thus defined are independent of the decomposition employed . </S>",
    "<S> a corollary of this is that previously constructed versions of homogeneous besov spaces on @xmath0 , relying on the spectral calculus of a sub - laplacian of the group , are consistent , i.e. , independent of the choice of sub - laplacian .    </S>",
    "<S> we further prove characterizations of homogeneous besov spaces using continuous wavelet transforms , with a large variety of analysing wavelets to choose from . </S>"
