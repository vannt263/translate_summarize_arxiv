    "second , the properties of this model in natural time are compared to those of the ses activities in section [ tria ] .",
    "this comparison is carried out by making use of the most recent experimental data of ses activities observed in greece during the last several months .",
    "section [ tesera ] presents the conclusions .",
    "two appendices are also provided , the first of which refers to the earthquakes that followed the ses activities presented here .",
    "appendix b clarifies that an early model proposed by voss@xcite differs essentially from the one presented here .",
    "here , we present a simple competitive evolution model which results , when analyzed in natural time , to @xmath0 `` noise '' with @xmath1 very close to unity .",
    "let us consider the cardinality @xmath15 of the family of sets @xmath46 of _ successive extrema",
    "_ obtained from a given probability distribution function ( pdf ) ; @xmath47 equals to the empty set .",
    "each @xmath46 is obtained by following the procedure described below for @xmath20 times .",
    "select a random number @xmath48 from a given pdf ( here , we use the exponential pdf , i.e. , @xmath49 ) and compare it with all the members of @xmath50 . in order to construct the set @xmath51 , we _ disregard _ from the set @xmath50 all its members that are smaller than @xmath48 and furthermore _ include _ @xmath48 .",
    "thus , @xmath52 for _ all _ n@xmath53 and @xmath54 is a finite set of real numbers whose members are always larger or equal to @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 \\geq \\min[{\\rm e_{n-1}}]$ ] and @xmath56 \\geq \\max[{\\rm e_{n-1}}]$ ] .",
    "the cardinality @xmath57 of these sets , which may be considered as equivalent to the dimensionality of the thresholds distribution in the coherent noise model ( e.g. see ref.@xcite and references therein ) , if considered as time - series with respect to the _ natural _ number @xmath20 ( see fig.[fmodel](a ) ) exhibits @xmath0 noise with @xmath1 very close to unity , see fig.[fmodel](b ) .",
    "this very simple model whose evolution is depicted in fig.[fmodel](a ) , leads to a detrended fluctuation analysis@xcite ( dfa ) exponent @xmath58 close to unity , see fig.[fmodel](c ) , being compatible with the @xmath8 power spectrum depicted in fig.[fmodel](b ) .",
    "the mathematical model described above corresponds to an asymptotically non - stationary process , since @xmath59 with a variance @xmath60 ( see fig.[fmodel](d ) ) .",
    "thus , in simple words , the present model suggests that the cardinality @xmath15 of the family of sets @xmath46 of successive extrema exhibits @xmath0 behavior when considered as time - series with respect to the natural ( time ) number @xmath20 .",
    "we note that a connection between @xmath0 noise and extreme value statistics has been established and proposed as providing a new angle at the generic aspect of the phenomena@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the frame of a formal similarity between the discrete spectrum of quantum systems and a discrete time series@xcite the following striking similarity is noticed : the fact that @xmath61 together with the behavior @xmath62 of the present model is reminiscent of the power law exponent and the @xmath63 statistic in chaotic quantum systems@xcite .    in order to check the stability of the results of fig.[fmodel ] , we present in fig.[sfdfa](a ) the average power spectrum obtained from @xmath14 runs of the model . a sharp @xmath8 behavior is observed .",
    "moreover , in fig.[sfdfa](b ) , we present the results of the corresponding average values of @xmath12 obtained from dfa of various orders @xmath10 ( i.e. , when detrending with a polynomial of order @xmath10 , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "figure [ sfdfa](b ) indicates that @xmath13 is close to unity .",
    "we now discuss an analytical procedure which clarifies some properties of the model . in order to find analytically the distribution of the probabilities @xmath64 ,",
    "one has simply to consider the possible outcomes when drawing @xmath20 random numbers @xmath48 .",
    "since the selection is made by a means of a pdf , all these numbers are different from each other , thus -when sorted they- are equivalent to @xmath20 points ( sites ) lying on the real axis .",
    "the value of @xmath15 varies as @xmath65 permutate along these @xmath20 sites _ independently _ from the pdf used in the calculation .",
    "thus , a detailed study of the permutation group of @xmath20 objects can lead to an exact solution of the model .",
    "it is well known , however , that the number of the elements of this group is n ! and this explains why we preferred to use the numerical calculation shown in fig.[fmodel ] .",
    "some exact results obtained by this method are the following : @xmath66 ; @xmath67 , since @xmath68 ; @xmath69 , since @xmath70 and @xmath71 ; @xmath72 ( see fig.[x4 ] ) .",
    "figure [ x4 ] analyzes the results for @xmath16 ( fig.[x4](a ) ) and @xmath73 ( fig.[x4](b ) ) .",
    "one can see that the probability @xmath22 equals to the sum of the @xmath20 possible outcomes as @xmath48 moves from the left to right in the @xmath20 columns of fig.[x4 ] . in each column , the probability to have at the end @xmath74 is just equal to the probability to keep @xmath75 numbers from the numbers already drawn that are larger than @xmath48 .",
    "this results in @xmath76 ( cf .",
    "@xmath77 ) .",
    "equation ( [ dom ] ) enables us to calculate the characteristic function ( see p.928 of ref.@xcite ) @xmath78 indeed , by substituting @xmath79 in @xmath80 , we obtain @xmath81 whereas by substituting @xmath82 in @xmath83 , we find @xmath84 subtracting now eq.([m2 ] ) from eq.([m1 ] ) , we finally get @xmath85 since @xmath86 , we find that eq.([ana1 ] ) -upon considering eq.6.1.22 of ref.@xcite- results in @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the gamma function .",
    "now , the mean and all the central moments @xmath89 of the distribution of @xmath79 can be obtained by virtue of the cumulant theorem ( see p.928 of ref.@xcite ) : @xmath90 substituting eq.([chara ] ) into eqs.([c1 ] ) to ( [ c4 ] ) and using the properties of the polygamma functions ( i.e. , the n - th order logarithmic derivatives of the gamma function , see p.260 of ref.@xcite ) , we obtain @xmath91 equations ( [ t1 ] ) to ( [ t4 ] ) enable us to calculate the mean , standard deviation @xmath92(@xmath93 ) , skewness @xmath94 and kurtosis @xmath95 as a function of @xmath20 .",

    "for dichotomous signals , which is frequently the case of ses activities , the quantity @xmath45 mentioned in section i stands for the duration of the @xmath43-th pulse .",

    "characteristic function _ for the probability distribution @xmath113 in the context of probability theory .",

    "infinitely _ ranged temporal correlations and obey the conditions@xcite : @xmath125 and @xmath126    we first present in subsection [ mia ] the most recent experimental results on seismic electric signals activities and their properties are compared , in subsection [ dia ] , with those of the model proposed as well as with a discrete model proposed@xcite by r.f.voss(see appendix b ) .",
    "the classification , in advance , of these ses activities , on the basis of relations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) has been verified by the occurrence of three magnitude 6.0-class earthquakes ( see appendix a ) .",
    "figure [ f3 ] depicts the original time series of four electrical disturbances that have been recently recorded on : ( a ) february 8 , 2007 , ( b ) april 23 , 2007 , ( c ) april 24 , 2007 and",
    "( d ) november 7 , 2007 at a measuring station termed patras ( pat ) located at @xmath127 km west of athens .",
    "all these four recent electric signals were analyzed in natural time .",
    "for example , if we read in natural time the signal on april 24 , 2007 ( fig.[f3](c ) ) -the dichotomous representation of which is marked by the dotted ( blue ) line in fig.[fn6](a)- we find the natural time representation of fig.[fn6](b ) the analysis of which leads to the values @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 . the relevant results of all the four signals are compiled in table [ tab1 ] and found to be consistent with the conditions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , thus they can be classified as ses activities ( for their subsequent seismicity as well as for more recent ses activities see appendix a ) .",
    "an inspection of table [ tab1 ] shows that the @xmath4 value is more or less comparable to that of @xmath3 , but experimental uncertainty does not allow any conclusion which of them is larger . note that in several former examples@xcite , the data analysis also showed that the @xmath4 value may either be smaller or larger than @xmath37 .",
    "we now turn to investigate whether the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 deduced from the 1/f model of section [ dyo ] are consistent to those resulted from the analysis of the ses activities observed .",
    "figure [ natmodel ] summarizes the results of @xmath14 runs of the model which , for moderate sizes of @xmath20 , seems to obey more or less the conditions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath131 ( which is frequently the number of pulses of the ses activities observed in field experiments ) , fig.[natmodel ] shows that @xmath28 is close to 0.070 , @xmath132 and ( in most cases ) @xmath133",

    "the origin of this incompatibility has not yet been fully understood .",
    "it might be due to the fact that ses activities exhibit _ critical _ dynamics , while the model can not capture all the characteristics of such dynamics .    since the model proposed here might be considered as reminiscent of an early @xmath8 model proposed by r.f.voss ( see ref.@xcite ) , which is also a discrete one , we also present in fig.[voss ] the corresponding results of @xmath14 runs of that model .",
    "( the details of the model are given in appendix b ) .",
    "a comparison of figs.[natmodel ] and [ voss ] for @xmath136 reveals that the results of the two models differ essentially . for example , in the voss model , @xmath3 is larger than @xmath31 while the opposite holds for the model proposed here .",
    "moreover , when comparing the results of the voss model with those of the ses activities we also find considerable differences . for example",
    ", the @xmath28 value deduced from the voss model is ( on the average ) _ larger _ than @xmath30 , thus differing considerably from the value @xmath137 of the ses activities .",
    "this , as mentioned above , is comparable to the one deduced from the model proposed here and explains why we focused on this paper on the comparison of that model -among the variety of models suggested to date for the explanation of the 1/f behavior- with the experimental values obtained from the analysis of the ses activities",
    "in summary , using the newly introduced concept of natural time:(a ) a simple model is proposed that exhibits @xmath0 behavior with @xmath1 close to unity .",
    "( b ) electric signals , recorded during the last few months in greece , are classified as ses activities since they exhibit _ infinitely _ ranged temporal correlations . actually , three magnitude 6.0 class earthquakes already occurred in greece ( see appendix a ) .",
    "( c ) for sizes @xmath20 comparable to those of the ses activities measured in the field experiments ( i.e. , @xmath138 ) , the model proposed here leads to values of the parameters @xmath28 ( @xmath139 ) and @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) that are consistent with those deduced from the ses activities analysis .",
    "despite of this fact , however , the model results in @xmath3 values that are almost always larger than those of @xmath4 , while the observed ses activities result in @xmath4 values that may be either larger or smaller than @xmath3 .",

    "we show below that the occurrence time of this strong eq can be estimated by following the procedure described in refs.@xcite .",
    "we study how the seismicity evolved after the recording of the ses activity at pat on february 8 , 2007 , by considering either the area a:@xmath144 or its smaller area b:@xmath145 ( see fig.[af1 ] ) .",

    "starting the computation of seismicity from the initiation of the ses activity on april 24 , 2007 ( which , between the two ses activities depicted in figs.[f3](b ) and [ f3](c ) , has the higher actual amplitude ) , we obtain the results depicted in figs.[afx2](a),(b ) and [ afx2](c),(d ) for the areas c and d , respectively , for @xmath154 and @xmath147 .",

    "this study , which as mentioned above was still in progress upon the initial submission of this paper , was made by investigating the seismicity in the area b of fig.[af1 ] , i.e. , @xmath157 as well as in the larger area , i.e. , @xmath36 ( see ref.@xcite ) , which are shown in fig.[fig12 ] .",

    "an inspection of these two figures reveals that the conditions for a _ true _ coincidence ( see subsection a.1 ) were obeyed upon the occurrence of the first event early in the morning ( i.e. , at 03:25 ut ) on 30 december , 2007 with an epicenter at @xmath158n @xmath159e and magnitude 3.9 .",
    "almost three hours later , i.e. , at 06:42 ut , a strong earthquake of magnitude 5.3 occurred at @xmath160n @xmath161e marked with the small star in fig.[fig14 ] .",
    "in addition , and quite interestingly , the four parameters @xmath28 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath39 during the next few days continued to fulfill the conditions for a true coincidence , as it is evident from a closer inspection of figs.[fig13](a ) and [ fig13](b ) .",
    "actually , at 05:14 ut on 6 january , 2008 , a major magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred , which was felt not only all over greece but also in adjacent countries , e.g. , southern italy and western turkey .",
    "its epicenter , marked with a large star in fig.[fig14 ] , was located at @xmath162n @xmath163e , i.e. , only around 50 km to the south of the larger area studied since the initial submission of this paper .",
    "interestingly , in the part of the latter area adjacent to the epicenter ( which is shaded in fig.[fig14 ] ) the four parameters @xmath28 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath39 reached the conditions for a true coincidence just in the morning ( i.e. , at 04:24 ut ) of 5 january , 2008 upon the occurrence of a magnitude 3.6 earthquake at @xmath164n @xmath165e ( it corresponds to the last point in fig.[fig13](c ) where @xmath39 becomes smaller than @xmath166 ) .    finally , we note that _ after _ the initial submission of this paper , two additional ses activities have been recorded as follows ( see fig.[nfx ] ) : one ses activity at pat on 10 january , 2008 and another one on 14 january , 2008 at the station pir located in western greece , see fig.[fig12 ] ( cf . the configuration of the measuring dipoles in the latter station is described in detail in the epaps document of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "their subsequent seismicities are currently studied along the lines explained above considering the evolving seismicity in the following areas : concerning the former ses activity at pat the areas depicted in fig.[fig12 ] , while for the one at pir on 14 january , 2008 , the subsequent seismicity is studied in the area b of fig.[af1 ] as well as in the larger area @xmath167 and in the one surrounding the epicenter@xcite ( @xmath168n @xmath169e ) .",
    "we now offer some comments on the classification of the aforementioned electric signals of fig.[nfx ] as ses activities .",
    "concerning the signal on 14 january , 2008 , which is of clear dichotomous nature , the analysis is made by considering that @xmath45 stands for the duration of @xmath43-th pulse , as mentioned in section i , and the following parameters are obtained : @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , which obey the conditions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) for the classification of the signal as ses activity .",
    "furthermore , note the @xmath3 is smaller than that of @xmath4 , which is not compatible with the model proposed in section ii , thus strengthening the point mentioned in section iii.b as well as in the conclusions ( section iv ) that the model does not seem to capture the characteristics of critical dynamics exhibited by ses activities .",
    "we now turn to the signal recorded at pat on 10 january , 2008 , the feature of which is not clearly dichotomous since it consists of three main pulses that seem to overlap ( note that , in general , if pulses of very short duration exist , the calculation of @xmath45 should necessarily consider the characteristics of the low pass filters used in our measurements@xcite .",
    "this has been considered in drawing the dichotomous representation -marked by the dotted ( blue ) line- in fig.[nfx](a ) ) .",
    "its analysis leads to the following values @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 .",
    "these values , which are _ different _ from those deduced from the analysis of the ses activity on 7 november , 2007 , also obey the conditions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) . at this point",
    ", we clarify that the optimality of natural time domain for enhancing the signal s localization in the time - frequency space was shown@xcite without assuming that @xmath45 stands for the pulse duration , but it was noted that in general @xmath45 is a quantity proportional to the corresponding energy released in the @xmath43-th event ( estimated by means of the time integration of the signal exceeding the level of the irrelevant background noise ) .      meanwhile , the earthquakes that followed the ses activities : ( i ) depicted in fig.[nfx ] and ( ii ) recorded on 29 february - 2 march , 2008 later at pir ( see n.v.sarlis , e.s .",

    "in addition , a strong electrical disturbance has been recorded at 9 october , 2008 ( fig.[r091008 ] ) , having an amplitude comparable to that in fig.[f3](d ) .",
    "the relevant analysis of the subsequent seismicity in natural time is carried out in the area @xmath176 .",
    "such an analysis , when considering the noa seismic data published until december 6 , 2008 , we find the results depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig18](a ) and [ fig18](b ) for magnitude thresholds 3.0 and 3.2 , respectively .",
    "an inspection of these figures shows that prob ( @xmath28 ) exhibits a local maximum at @xmath137 , thus obeying eq.[eq1 ] .",
    "the spatial invariance of this result is currently investigated in order to check whether the critical point has been actually approached .",
    "a model producing @xmath8 noise , suggested by richard f. voss , was presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "this model assumes some number @xmath19 of @xmath43-sided dices , i.e. , the outcome of a rolling the @xmath10-th dice is equally distributed among the values @xmath177 . to each dice",
    "@xmath10 , one relates the @xmath10-th digit of the binary representation of a number @xmath178 .",
    "the procedure to generate the @xmath8 noise starts ( @xmath179 ) by rolling all dices and assign their sum to @xmath180(@xmath181 ) . in the second step ( @xmath182 ) , one rerolls only the dice associated with the least significant digit of the binary representation , and the new roll @xmath183 is summed with the previous rolls of all other dices so that @xmath184 .",
    "the procedure continues up to @xmath185 , each time rolling only the dices associated with the digits that change when considering the binary representation of @xmath20 compared to @xmath186",
    ". this model results in time - series @xmath32 of length @xmath187 whose spectrum is close to 1/f , and their values @xmath32 are obviously distributed among the integers @xmath19 and @xmath188 .",
    "the time series @xmath32 clearly differ from @xmath15 apart from the fact that they both have integer values . to visualize this difference , we depict in fig.[pdf](b ) the distribution of @xmath189 for the case of 6-sided dices ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "it can be easily found , since upon considering the binary representation of @xmath190 compared to @xmath191 , _ all _ digits change and one rerolls all dices . clearly , rolling all dices results in a symmetric ( _ skewnessless _ ) distribution for @xmath192 ( see fig.[pdf](b ) ) .",
    "indeed , by considering the distribution of the sum of rolling @xmath19 independent @xmath43-sided dices and using the characteristic function method discussed in subsection [ dyob ] , one can find the following cumulants : @xmath193 clearly , eqs.([nc1 ] ) to ( [ nc4 ] ) for the distribution of @xmath192 differ from eqs.([t1 ] ) to ( [ t4 ] ) for the distribution of @xmath15 . among their differences ,",
    "the following two are the most striking : first , @xmath192 is skewnessless ( see eq.([nc3 ] ) ) whereas that of @xmath15 is not , and second the two distributions have different signs in their kurtoses ."
