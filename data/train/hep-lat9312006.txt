    "ever since the work of degrand and toussaint@xcite , who gave a prescription for constructing monopoles in compact qed , there is no doubt that monopoles can yield a clear signal as to the location of the u(1 ) phase transition in four dimensions and that one can characterize the phase structure from the dynamical behavior of monopoles .",
    "their results have been confirmed by barber who found a strong correlation between the average plaquette action and the total monopole length@xcite .",
    "further evidence for the influence of monopoles on the phase structure has been given in a recent work of bornyakov et al .",
    "these authors suppressed configurations containing monopoles , on the level of the partition function .",
    "this led to a deconfined phase throughout a @xmath0-range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "the latter result suggests that monopoles play an active role in controlling the phase structure of u(1 ) rather than being just another signal for the phase change .",
    "such a scenario is supported by the observation of very strong hysteresis effects@xcite , which lead to supercritical slowing down ( scsd ) for the u(1 ) updating . as to a possible mechanism how monopoles affect the phase structure and handicap the efficiency of the updating , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argued that periodically closed monopole current loops , _ i.  e. _ loops closed due to the finiteness of the lattice and the periodical boundary conditions imposed , are responsible for long lived metastable states .",
    "it remains an open question , how in the infinite volume limit  where periodically closed loops should be absent  scsd can be explained by such a mechanism .",
    "or is scsd just a finite - size phenomenon in u(1 ) ?",
    "our present approach is to proceed from previous _",
    "global _ analyses to an investigation of detailed _ spatial _ structures by locating closed monopole loops on the lattice and determining their properties .",
    "we have no well - founded criterion , however , which would allow to identify single closed loops unambiguously , in view of the observed proliferation of monopole line crossings .",
    "therefore , we restrict our considerations to _ clusters _ of loops , _ i.  e. _  objects composed out of connected monopole lines .",
    "we compute observables like the winding number and the length of single clusters .",
    "we will also try to uncover topological structures , which might be hidden by the local fluctuations .",
    "we adopt the usual definition for monopole world lines in four dimensions@xcite : @xmath3,\\ ] ] with @xmath4 the plaquette flux for the wilson action varies between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the physical flux lies in the range between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and @xmath9 can take on integer values between @xmath10 and @xmath2 . the divergence of the monopole links vanishes , @xmath11 , giving rise to closed loops of monopole lines .",
    "the monopole lines can intersect , and the identification of single monopole loops is ambiguous as depicted in fig .  [ ambiguous ] .    in the first example , either two plaquette - loops or one large loop with one crossing can be identified .",
    "the second example can either be viewed as two periodically closed loops and one square loop or as one large loop homotopic to a point .",
    "we emphasize again that the actual monopole clusters turn out to be utterly entangled .",
    "numerous loop crossings occur .",
    "therefore , we have concentrated our investigation on monopole clusters , _",
    "i.  e. _ objects composed out of connected closed loops .",
    "our numerical work has been done on a connection machine cm-5 .",
    "we designed data - parallel and message - passing algorithms in order to locate the clusters@xcite .",
    "we worked on lattices of size @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for each size , we performed about 100000 sweeps using standard metropolis updating and analyzed more than 10000 configurations . in each case , we worked at the respective coexistence point @xmath14@xcite .",
    "the confined phase is characterized by the occurrence of large clusters . in particular , on the @xmath13-lattice the contribution of smaller loops nearly vanishes and one cluster is filling up the whole lattice . in the coulomb phase ,",
    "the large cluster is split into several smaller pieces .",
    "this goes along with a decreasing total length of monopole lines .",
    "we interpret a tunnelling event from the coulomb to the confined phase as a condensation from a dilute monopole current gas to a condensed cluster .",
    "the simulation algorithm should be capable to drive tunnelling , _",
    "i.  e. _ to create and to destroy large clusters .    a four - dimensional visualization@xcite of the tunnelling reveals an entangled jumble of monopole lines throughout the system . in an attempt to look into those clusters",
    ", we analyzed the number of crossings , @xmath15 .",
    "we found nearly linear correlation between @xmath15 and the length of the clusters , @xmath16 , cf .",
    "fig .  [ crossings ] .",
    "we define the _ winding number _ for the direction @xmath17 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lattice extension in @xmath17-direction .",
    "if this number is non - zero the considered cluster is wrapping around the lattice along the specified direction .",
    "among 10000 analyzed configurations of the @xmath12-lattice , we found only 8 events with non - zero winding numbers .",
    "these clusters came up within the flip region from the confined to the coulomb phase .",
    "the lifetimes of the non - zero winding numbers ranged from one to two sweeps . on the @xmath13-lattice",
    ", we did not encounter any periodically closed cluster within the confined phase and in particular within the flip region between the two phases .",
    "one might argue , however , that topologically important structures within the monopole clusters might be hidden under the local fluctuations . in an attempt to remove the fluctuations and to reveal those structures , we imposed two different types of cooling on the configurations , the first by minimizing the action and the second by cooling adiabatically .    in the coulomb phase , where the clusters are small , no non - zero winding numbers appear through the cooling procedure . within the confined phase , however , we observe that the cooling process gives rise to the creation of such winding numbers .",
    "the time history under cooling depends strongly on the type of cooling , generating winding numbers in different directions .",
    "furthermore , for a given cooling procedure , the directions @xmath17 , eq .",
    "[ winding ] , fluctuate frequently from sweep to sweep .",
    "this is another aspect of the fact that it is impossible to identify single closed loops unambiguously .",
