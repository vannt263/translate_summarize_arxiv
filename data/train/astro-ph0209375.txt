    "the cosmic history of star formation has been extensively investigated in recent times .",
    "there is a general consensus that the star formation rate ( sfr ) increases with look - back time to peak somewhere at @xmath1 , then levels off , with a possible decline at higher redshifts .",
    "however , the issue is far from closed . in particular , the location of the peak and the behaviour of the sfr at high redshifts are still a matter of extensive debate .    the nature of the star formation history ( sfh ) can be determined using a number of different observational techniques .",
    "perhaps the most direct method is to make use of observations in the rest - frame near - ultraviolet ( uv ) , as this part of the spectra of galaxies with no active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are dominated by emission from short - lived , massive stars ( e.g. lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; madau et al . 1996 ; connolly et al .",
    "1997 ; madau , pozzetti & dickinson 1998 ; treyer et al . 1998 ; cowie , songaila & barger 1999 ) .",
    "it is also possible to observe the luminosities of nebular emission lines ( especially h@xmath2 ) , which are due to reprocessed ionizing radiation from the young , massive stars ( e.g. hogg et al .",
    "1998 ; tresse & maddox 1998 ; glazebrook et al . 1999",
    "; hopkins , connolly & szalay 2000 ; teplitz et al .",
    "2000 ; pettini et al .",
    "neither of these methods , however , account for the effects of dust extinction .",
    "the importance of extinction has been shown by numerous studies that show the disagreement of different sfh diagnostics , which are affected by extinction in different ways ( e.g. mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ; rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1997 ; cram et al .",
    "1998 ; flores et al . 1999 ; adelberger & steidel 2000 ; sullivan et al . 2001 ) and from the large fraction of energy in the cosmic far - infrared and submillimetre backgrounds ( puget et al . 1996 ) .",
    "estimates of the extinction correction factor are around 210 ( e.g. meurer et al .",
    "1997 ; dickinson 1998 ; pettini et al .",
    "1998 ; glazebrook et al . 1999 ; steidel et al . 1999",
    "; hopkins et al . 2000 ; teplitz et al .",
    "it is , however , possible that some star formation could be totally hidden in heavily obscured objects , which would not be accounted for at all by a correction to the uv / optical estimates ( franceschini et al .",
    "1997 ; guiderdoni et al .",
    "1998 ; elbaz et al .",
    "1999 ; but see adelberger & steidel 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , it has recently been shown that the far - infrared ( fir ) to uv flux ratio breaks down for some star - forming galaxies ( bell & kennicutt 2001 ) , ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; meurer et al . 2000 ) and lyman break galaxies ( e.g. baker et al .",
    "2001 ) , which makes it difficult to determine the sfr by simply applying an extinction correction .    to avoid these problems , it is necessary to look at the radiation re - emitted from dust heated by the young stellar population , which will also reveal any obscured star - forming population . since thermal dust emission peaks in the rest - frame far - infrared ( ir ) ,",
    "this is done with submillimetre and far - ir surveys ( e.g. rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1997 ; hughes et al . 1998 ; blain et al .",
    "the main drawback with this method is the uncertainty of the contributions of cumulative heating of the dust by the old stellar population and agns ( blain et al .",
    "1999c ; brusa , comastri & vignali 2001 ) .",
    "a very different way of approaching the issue of how to determine the sfh is to use source count models . broadly speaking , these fall into one of two categories : the so - called ` forwards ' and ` backwards ' models ( lonsdale 1996 ) .",
    "the forwards method statistically follows the growth of dark matter haloes forwards in time by accretion and mergers ( e.g. kauffmann & white 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ; blain et al . 1999c ; granato et al . 2000",
    "; somerville , primack & faber 2001 ) then assumes a semi - analytic galaxy formation paradigm and evolutionary framework . in the backwards method , by contrast , a local luminosity function",
    "is evolved backwards in time , assuming some form of evolution , such as a change in sfr ( e.g. pearson & rowan - robinson 1996 ; eales & edmunds 1997 ; xu et al .",
    "1998 ; takeuchi et al . 1999",
    "; pearson 2001 ; rowan - robinson 2001 ; xu et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in rowan - robinson ( 2001 ; hereafter rr01 ) , a source count model using a parametrized approach to the sfh was presented .",
    "this method models the sfh as a combined power - law and exponential , the relative strengths of which are allowed to vary freely .",
    "this is capable of reproducing most physically realistic forms of the sfh and allows a large set of possible histories to be investigated .",
    "source count predictions are then compared to observations , allowing the range of sfh parameters to be limited .",
    "this method is similar in some ways to those of guiderdoni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and blain et al . ( 1999b ) .    the parametrized approach of rr01 provided good fits to data in the submillimetre and far- and mid - ir regions of the spectrum ( @xmath3 m ) .",
    "however , the best - fitting model shows a deficit of faint ( @xmath4 ) optical and near - ir sources compared to observations .",
    "also , the number of high redshift sources are over - predicted .",
    "rr01 proposes that these problems could be caused by density evolution , or by a steepening of the faint - end luminosity function at @xmath5 .    in this work ,",
    "an attempt to solve the faint optical count issue by allowing a variation of optical depth with redshift using the calzetti & heckman ( 1999 ) evolution model and by including density evolution is presented .",
    "the objective is to produce an effective , multi - wavelength source count model , based on that detailed in rr01 .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in ",

    "finally , the conclusions are presented in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a backwards source count model can be constructed using four basic ingredients : a cosmology , a luminosity function , a form of evolution ( luminosity and/or density ) and a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . in this work ,",
    "the model of rr01 is used as a base : a more detailed description of the model can be found in that paper . for computational speed , an einstein ",

    "the results of this are used to limit the free parameter space of the lambda cosmology ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the luminosity function used is determined from the _ iras _ pscz sample ( saunders et al .",

    "the other parameters take into account the change of the 60-@xmath21 m luminosity function as the rate of evolution is varied ( see  [ subsec : evolution ] ) .",
    "changes in the sfr within a galaxy will affect its luminosity .",

    "@xmath26 measures how steeply the process of buildup of rate of star formation due to mergers of fragments , which are incorporated into galaxies , occurs with time .",
    "@xmath27 describes an exponential decay in the star formation rate , on a timescale @xmath29 , which is a product of the process of exhaustion of available gas for star formation  this being the result of a competition between the processes of gas being formed into stars and it being returned to the ism by winds and supernovae .",
    "it is assumed , for computational purposes , that @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "although this introduces an unphysical discontinuity in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : sfh ] ) , rr01 finds that the effect on the results is negligible .",
    "now that the luminosity evolution has been selected , the remaining parameters in the luminosity function can be approximated in the e - ds case by least - squares fitting the saunders et al .",

    "in addition to the luminosity evolution , this density evolution also needs to be considered .",
    "this can be parametrized simply as :    @xmath35    in this case , the evolution parameter , @xmath36 , becomes    @xmath37    many source count models consider only pure luminosity evolution or pure density evolution , but here both forms will be considered simultaneously .    in the lambda cosmology with density evolution ,",
    "these parameters become :    @xmath38    @xmath39 where    @xmath40      to transform the 60-@xmath21 m luminosity function to other wavelengths , some model of the sed must be constructed .",
    "rr01 explored a variety of assumptions about the seds .",
    "the method that was most consistent with available data was to derive the counts separately for each of four components  starburst ( m82-like ) , ` cirrus ' ( normal , non - active galaxy ) , ulirg ( arp 220-like ) and agn  then sum them .",
    "for the starburst and cirrus components , predictions for infrared seds from efstathiou , rowan - robinson & siebenmorgen ( 2000 ) are used , and near - ir / optical / uv seds are added , corresponding to an sab galaxy ( yoshii & takahara 1988 ) for the cirrus component and an h@xmath41ii galaxy , tol 1924  416 ( calzetti & kinney 1992 ) , for the starburst component .",
    "these are selected as ` typical ' galaxies , rather than as averages .",
    "for the cirrus component , the optical sed has been divided into a contribution of young , high - mass stars ( dominating at @xmath42 m ) and of old , low - mass stars ( dominating at @xmath43 m ) .",
    "this is obviously a quite approximate treatment , but produces reasonable counts in the _ k_- and _ b_-bands . for the agn component , the dust torus model of rowan - robinson ( 1995 )",
    "is used ( see also rowan - robinson & efstathiou 1993 and efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ) .",
    "the complete seds are shown in fig .",
    "3 of rr01 .",
    "the proportions of the four components at 60-@xmath21 m as a function of luminosity were chosen to give correct relations in colour - colour diagrams , as detailed in rr01 .",
    "the relative proportion of the 60-@xmath21 m emission due to agns is derived from the 12-@xmath21 m luminosity function of rush , malkan & spinoglio ( 1993 ) .",
    "the models of rr01 fit the available source count data well from mid - infrared to submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "however , in the _",

    "this faint blue excess could be caused by a number of factors , such as uncertainties in the faint end of the local luminosity function , some form of evolution or a missing population of objects ( see review by ellis 1997 ) .",
    "one factor that is known to occur , and could cause a faint blue excess , is the variation of optical depth with redshift ( calzetti 1999 ; pei , fall & hauser 1999 ) .",
    "it is probable that the opacity changes differently for the various types of sources , but we have used a ` characteristic ' opacity variation , in the manner of calzetti 1999 and pei et al . 1999 , as this reduces the number of free parameters .",
    "star formation produces stars with a range of masses , some of which will be sufficiently massive to explode as supernova very quickly ( @xmath47 years ; leitherer & heckman 1995 ) , injecting heavy metals into the interstellar medium and producing large quantities of dust on short time scales ( @xmath48  @xmath49 myr , e.g. jones et al .",
    "1994 ; dwek 1998 ) .",
    "the global star formation rate varies with redshift , so the co - moving density of metals , @xmath50 , and hence the dust density , will also vary .",
    "this variation takes the form of an increase with redshift , peaking somewhere between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , then declining ( see fig .",
    "8 , bottom panel of pei et al .",
    "this form is the result of a competition between the release of metals into the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the metals being taken - up from the ism as the gas is locked into stars .    as the opacity of the ism",
    "is determined by the combination of the dust column density ( dependent on @xmath50 and the gas column density ) , the extinction curve and the dust distribution , it is possible to model the opacity change with redshift .",
    "this new factor can be included in the source count model of rr01 by altering the luminosity distance accordingly .",
    "initially , the obscuration model of pei & fall ( 1995 ) was investigated , using the dust model of rowan - robinson ( 1992 ) and the colour excess model of pei et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , assuming the local mean fraction of starlight absorbed by dust , @xmath53 . here",
    ", the obscuration of the flux , @xmath54 , is parametrized as :    @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the colour excess and @xmath57 is the dust obscuration factor .",
    "however , this model does not solve the faint excess problem , as the opacity drops at @xmath5 , and we are trying to reduce the number of faint ( hence mostly high redshift ) galaxies .",
    "a model is required which predicts that the optical depth does not drop until a higher redshift . in order to meet this criterion ,",
    "the calzetti ( 1999 ) obscuration model was investigated , using model 3 from calzetti & heckman ( 1999 ) for @xmath58 , as this does not begin to drop until @xmath59 ( see fig . 9 , top panel of calzetti & heckman 1999 ) . the calzetti ( 1999 ) model analytically parametrizes the ` net ' obscuration as :    @xmath60    based on observations of high redshift galaxies , where :    @xmath61 for @xmath62 , and    @xmath63 for @xmath64 .    outside this range of @xmath65 , the rowan - robinson ( 1992 ) dust form",
    "this is based on a multigrain model , fitted to the interstellar extinction curve and the far - ir spectrum of dust in our galaxy .",
    "a look - up table of values of @xmath66 for different wavelengths is used , interpolating where necessary .",
    "this correction for the optical depth history requires a new parameter , @xmath67 , to be introduced into the source count model .",
    "this represents the mean _ v _ band extinction in the local ( @xmath68 ) universe and can be varied whilst retaining the dependence on redshift of the calzetti & heckman ( 1999 ) model 3 extinction , @xmath69 .",
    "it is introduced into the net obscuration ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : obs ] ) as follows :    @xmath70 where    @xmath71    the effect of the optical depth variation introduced here is wavelength - dependent .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is smaller at higher wavelengths .",
    "it was found that at wavelengths of approximately 5-@xmath21 m and higher the effect is negligible . for computational speed , therefore , the correction was applied only at @xmath72 m .",
    "the source count model , with the optical depth history correction , has four free parameters : the characteristic visual extinction in the local universe , @xmath67 , the density evolution parameter , @xmath73 , and the two star formation parameters , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . to determine if the opacity correction could solve the fitting problem in the _ b _ band , these parameters were varied and the resulting model predictions compared to the available observations .    for a given waveband , there are two types of data available against which the models can be compared : source count data and redshift distribution data .",
    "generally , it is possible to obtain large statistics for source counts much more easily than for redshift distributions ( few spectroscopic redshifts are available and photometric redshifts can be unreliable ) . as the source counts are much more robust , statistically speaking , the procedure adopted was to first use the available redshift data  a catalogue of photometric and spectroscopic redshifts in the hubble deep field ( fern ' andez - soto , lanzetta & yahil 1999 ) derived from data at 0.3 , 0.45 , 0.6 and 0.8 @xmath21 m ( filters f300w , f450w , f606w and f814w , respectively ) and in the _",
    "j , h _ and _ k _ bands ( 1.2 , 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath21 m , respectively )  to constrain the parameter space to those sets that were as good as , or provided an improvement over , the @xmath45 e - ds model of rr01 .",
    "this was done by generating a large number of models ( @xmath74 ) with a wide range of different parameters , then using a reduced @xmath75 method to remove those that have a worse fit than the @xmath45 model",
    ".    as the number of sources at high redshift for the available data is small , the bins @xmath76  @xmath77  @xmath78 and @xmath79 are summed up to give one bin , @xmath80 .",
    "this gives the number of model points , @xmath81 and the number of free parameters , @xmath82 ( @xmath83 and @xmath67 ) and , hence , the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath84 .",
    "around 200 models had better fits than the @xmath45 model .    after a reasonable fit to the redshift distributions had been obtained , the source count data was investigated to find the best - fitting model .",

    "there are certain limitations to the model that might , if corrected for , give a good fit to the optical region with a lower density evolution parameter .",
    "possible candidates for improvement are :    1 .   accounting for ellipticals . the count model is based on the 60-@xmath21 m luminosity function , which provides a good fit in the infrared",
    ". however , this does miss out elliptical galaxies , which have little or no 60-@xmath21 m emission .",

    "2 .   separately evolving sed components . in the current model , the form of evolution adopted",
    "is applied to all the components equally .",

    "different types of galaxies will evolve differently with redshift , so separating them out would make the model more physical .",
    "redshift - dependent cirrus sed .",
    "the rr01 model does not account for the fact that the temperature of dust , and hence the sed , of cirrus galaxies will evolve with redshift . including this , perhaps as a look - up table of seds at different redshifts",
    ", would again make the model more physically realistic .",
    "introducing one or more of these might allow the density evolution parameter , @xmath73 , to be lowered , and hence the fit to the faint submillimetre counts improved , whilst retaining the goodness of fit in the optical region .",
    "the first of these factors is quite simple to correct for and is discussed in  [ subsec : ellip ] .",
    "initial results from the _ iras _ sky survey showed that very few elliptical galaxies had been detected in the fir ( de jong et al .",

    "1989 ) . as the 60-@xmath21 m emission",
    "is dominated by emission from cold ( @xmath104@xmath105 k ) dust , this implies that ellipticals typically have low dust densities ( e.g. goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ; merluzzi 1998 ) .",
    "these galaxies will not be accounted for by the 60-@xmath21 m luminosity function , which is used by the rr01 model , so some correction is needed .",
    "martel , premadi and matzner ( 1998 ) have used the observed galaxy morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) and a monte carlo technique based on the distribution of dark matter to simulate @xmath106 40,000 galaxies in the local universe . for an e - ds universe ,",
    "they find that ellipticals make up , on average , @xmath107 per cent of galaxies . hence ,",
    "since only @xmath102 per cent of ellipticals are detected at 60-@xmath21 m , the rr01 model misses out @xmath108 per cent of ` cirrus ' galaxies .",
    "a simple way to correct for this is to multiply the number density of the low - mass cirrus component by a factor of 1.104 at each flux bin for those models that split the cirrus component into low- and high - mass ( @xmath109 m ) .",
    "the result of applying this correction is shown in fig .",

    "<S> in order to improve the fit to the optical counts , the multi - wavelength source count model of rowan - robinson ( 2001 ) is improved in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , density evolution is incorporated to correspond to the mergers in hierarchical models of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the evolution of dust opacity is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity and density evolution parameters and the characteristic opacity of the local universe are allowed to vary freely and the best overall fit to the _ b _ band is determined . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter set is then translated to other wavebands , showing significant improvement of goodness of fit in the optical , uv and near - ir bands , whilst retaining the goodness of fit in the far - ir and submillimetre bands of the original model . a significant fraction of the improvement of fit is shown to be due to the introduction of optical depth history . </S>",
    "<S> the mean value of @xmath0 in the local universe for the best - fitting model is 0.4 . </S>",
    "<S> the goodness of fit to available star formation history data is not significantly altered and the form of the evolution of the luminosity function shown to be consistent with a semi - analytic , forward evolution model .    </S>",
