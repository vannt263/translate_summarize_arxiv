    "stripe phases are one of the most exciting phenomena of modern condensed matter physics .",
    "they have been observed in a variety of systems , including nickelates , @xcite cuprates , @xcite and manganites . @xcite among them , layered la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( lsco ) , la@xmath6nd@xmath7sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( nd - lsco ) , la@xmath3sr@xmath4nio@xmath5 ( lsno ) , and la@xmath8nio@xmath9 ( lno ) compounds play plausibly the most prominent role .",
    "however the similarity between them is superficial only , and the stripes in the cuprates differ from the stripes in the nickelates in many respects . for instance",
    ", they are dynamical in the former , and static in the latter . in addition , in nd - lsco @xcite and lsco,@xcite one finds the so - called _ half - filled stripes _ , with the density of one doped hole per two atoms along the domain wall ( dw ) . in contrast",
    ", it is clear from a variety of experiments that magnetic states within doped nio@xmath10 planes of the nickelates are _ filled stripes _ with density of one doped hole per one atom in a dw .",
    "@xcite    the question of filling is not the only difference between the nickelate and cuprate stripes , however .",
    "neutron diffraction measurements performed on nd - lsco revealed that magnetic peaks are displaced from the antiferromagnetic ( af ) maximum at @xmath11 to the points @xmath12 and @xmath13 and the shift @xmath14 depends linearly on hole doping @xmath15 for @xmath16 , while it is almost constant at higher doping .",
    "these values correspond to a superposition of _ vertical _ ( 01 ) and _ horizontal _ ( 10 ) dws .",
    "the essentially identical modulation and doping dependence of @xmath14 was observed in superconducting crystals of lsco with @xmath17 .",
    "conversely , experiments on lsno established that spin order is characterized by the wave vectors @xmath18 with @xmath19 for @xmath20 , corresponding to a constant charge of one hole / ni ion along a _ diagonal _",
    "dw , in agreement with the predictions made in the pioneering works by zaanen and gunnarsson@xcite and others , @xcite and emphasized recently,@xcite which predicted theoretically the stripe order .",
    "more precisely , neutron scattering measurements have revealed static stripe order in the lno samples with @xmath21 , 0.125 , as well as 0.133,@xcite and even over a wider hole doping regime @xmath22 in the case of lsno .",
    "@xcite moreover , the incommensurate ( ic ) stripe order persists up to @xmath23 in the nd@xmath3sr@xmath24nio@xmath5 system,@xcite in which the low temperature orthorhombic phase seems to extend to a higher doping region @xmath25 as compared to the la compounds , where the high temperature tetragonal phase is stabilized instead already at @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite    indications of a charge order ( co ) in doped lsno were also found in electron @xcite and x - ray diffraction studies .",
    "@xcite quite recently , the one - dimensional nature of the stripe modulation within nio@xmath10 planes has been directly confirmed in the transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) studies of charge stripes in lsno.@xcite in addition , careful examination of the tem images has shown that at a low temperature stripes are mainly centered on rows of ni atoms .",
    "however , a mixture of the so - called site centered ( sc ) and bond centered ( bc ) stripes was also observed in some small regions of the sample .",
    "in contrast to lsco , charge and spin order in lsno is characterized by the wave vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 , see ref .",
    ", respectively , with @xmath19 corresponding to a constant charge density of one hole / ni ion along the diagonal stripe .",
    "note that the doping dependence of @xmath14 is exactly the same as that found in the seminal hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations within the hubbard model.@xcite    experimentally the data give a clear evidence that the stripe order is most stable at hole doping @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , @xmath30 and @xmath31 increase linearly with @xmath15 , reach a maximum at @xmath29 with 240 and 180 k , respectively , and then decrease monotonously upon further doping .",
    "the particularly robust stability of stripes at @xmath32 stems from the cooperative spin and charge modulation expressed by the coincidence of the spin superlattice peaks at the wave vectors @xmath33 with those of co , given by @xmath34 .",
    "one should also note that @xmath14 starts to deviate gradually from the value given by the @xmath19 law above @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , co is even more stable than the stripe order at @xmath35 and forms a checkerboard pattern below the transition temperature @xmath36 k. remarkably , with decreasing temperature , a stripe co sets in below @xmath37 k and its incommensurability is twice as large as that of the spin order with the much lower onset temperature @xmath38 k.@xcite the low temperature competition of the checkerboard and stripe order at @xmath35 has also been clearly indicated by the measurements of raman and optical conductivity .",
    "@xcite interestingly , above this doping , incommensurability tends to saturate rapidly with the value @xmath39.@xcite    apparently , co itself induces commensurate values of @xmath14 and such a commensurability effect seems to be an intrinsic property of the stripe order .",
    "at the same time , the increased hole density at the dws suppresses the superexchange energy gain , best optimized when all the holes are accommodated within stripes .",
    "therefore , it is the af order that drives @xmath14 to approach the value given by the linear relation @xmath19 below @xmath31 . obviously , when @xmath29 , both effects cooperate which results in the locked - in value of @xmath40 over the entire @xmath41 range .",
    "furthermore , the temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath42 shows a distinct anomaly at the same temperature @xmath43 k suggesting a co transition.@xcite this conjecture is supported by the temperature dependence of the logarithmic resistivity .",
    "indeed , as expected for this transition , @xmath44 of the sample with @xmath45 exhibits a steep increase precisely at 240 k.@xcite charge fluctuations around @xmath43 k also lead to conspicuous changes in the optical conductivity spectra @xmath46.@xcite namely , at a high temperature @xmath47 , only a broad peak is observed with a finite low - energy spectral weight .",
    "however , when @xmath48 is decreased down to @xmath30 , the low - energy weight below 0.4 ev is gradually transferred to higher energy so that the opening of the charge gap is clearly observed .",
    "a special character of @xmath29 as well as @xmath35 doping , is best seen in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath49 and logarithmic resistivity @xmath44 , recorded at 200 k , showing distinct anomalies at these doping levels.@xcite in this context it is important to discuss a peculiar behavior of the hall coefficient @xmath50 and the seebeck coefficient @xmath51 at two representative values of temperature below and above @xmath43 k , i.e. , at 300 k and 210 k. the hall coefficient at 300 k is almost independent of doping and takes a small positive value corresponding to the order of one hole carrier per ni site.@xcite the seebeck coefficient shows a similar nearly constant behavior taking , however , a negative value . in contrast , below @xmath30 , both @xmath50 and @xmath51 change their signs from negative to positive at @xmath29 and their absolute values are larger than those at 300 k. in addition , for samples with @xmath45 and @xmath52 , @xmath50 keeps decreasing with decreasing @xmath48 , so that the number of carriers per ni site gets reduced even down to @xmath53 .",
    "these results indicate that the deviation of @xmath15 from @xmath54 can be considered as an electronlike ( @xmath20 ) or holelike ( @xmath55 ) carrier doping into the @xmath56 charge - ordered insulator with three ni sites in the unit cell .",
    "hence , for the doping level @xmath29 there is exactly one hole per unit cell and such a state is robust and may be considered as a half - filled one .",
    "moreover , it would certainly retain this feature if the incommensurability had followed precisely the relation @xmath57 .",
    "however , @xmath14 has a tendency to shift towards @xmath54 , for both sides of the @xmath29 point , which has important implications for the sign of @xmath50 . on the one hand ,",
    "when @xmath15 is less than @xmath54 , the number of holes is insufficient for filling up the mid - gap states entirely , i.e. , the states inside the charge transfer ( ct ) gap induced by stripe order , and in this case the mid - gap states contain some electrons which become carriers .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath15 larger than @xmath54 , the number of electrons is insufficient for filling up the lower hubbard band entirely , which initially contains holes .",
    "consequently , @xmath50 is expected to have the opposite sign to that in the case of @xmath20 ( hole carriers ) .",
    "next , the chemical potential shift @xmath58 in lsno for @xmath59 deduced either from x - ray ( xps ) or ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy @xcite is suppressed . certainly , this phenomenon can not be explained within a simple rigid - band framework in which @xmath60 is expected to shift downwards with increasing hole doping .",
    "in fact , an increase of @xmath15 in a system with a spatially uniform hole distribution should enhance the average hole - hole repulsion which , in turn , would result in a higher energy required to add one hole to the system , i.e. , in a larger @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the absence of @xmath58 implies that the average hole - hole repulsion remains nearly unaltered upon doping .",
    "such a behavior might be easily explained within a stripe picture in which a constant hole density at the dws implies that the interwall distance decreases and @xmath14 increases linearly with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , a similar suppression of the shift has been found below @xmath62 in lsco , suggesting that an inhomogeneous charge distribution is a common feature of both systems .",
    "several methods have been employed to investigate the stripe phases which go beyond the hf approximation , such as : density matrix renormalization group,@xcite slave - boson approximation,@xcite variational local ansatz approximation,@xcite exact diagonalization ( ed ) of finite clusters,@xcite analytical approach based on variational trial wave functions within the string picture,@xcite dynamical mean field theory,@xcite cluster perturbation theory,@xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations.@xcite they all address the crucial role of a proper treatment of local electron correlations in stabilization of the half - filled stripe phases in the cuprates . in spite of this huge effort ,",
    "it remains unclear whether dws are centered on rows of metal atoms as in sc stripes , or if they are centered on rows of oxygen atoms bridging two metal sites in bc stripes .",
    "although no evidence was presented yet , it seems that the degeneracy of @xmath63 orbitals plays an important role in stabilizing filled stripes in the nickelates . in the simplest picture developed for the cuprates , the cu@xmath64 ions forming dws are spinless , while the cu@xmath65 of the af domains carry a spin @xmath66 . in the nickelates , filled dws",
    "are formed of the ni@xmath64 ions ( @xmath66 ) , whereas the af domains consist of ni@xmath65 ions ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "therefore , a realistic hamiltonian for lsno has to contain , besides the @xmath68 orbital which is occupied by one hole in the parent compounds of the superconducting cuprates ( such as la@xmath10cuo@xmath5 and yba@xmath10cu@xmath69o@xmath70 ) , as well the @xmath71 orbital at each ion , so as to account for the high spin ( @xmath67 ) state of the stoichiometric compound .",
    "indeed , when extending their approach to a more realistic four - band peierls - hubbard model for nio@xmath10 planes , zaanen and littlewood have shown@xcite that doped holes prone to form diagonal dws , centered on rows of ni atoms , with a tendency to have a ferromagnetic ( fm ) alignment of the reduced ni magnetic moments at a dw . in fact , subsequent multiband hf calculations emphasized the relevance of the electron - lattice coupling  depending on its strength one can obtain either metal- or oxygen - centered structures .",
    "@xcite therefore , it appears that the semiclassical theory captures the essence of stripe physics in the nickelates .",
    "the stripes were also obtained in the theory using either the hf approximation applied to a multiband ct model , in which both the nickel and oxygen degrees of freedom are explicitely taken into account,@xcite or by the ed of finite clusters within the effective two - band model ( [ eq : h_deg ] ) extended by the coupling of @xmath0 electrons to the lattice.@xcite however , due to a large number of basis states , the latter calculation has solely been done for an eight site cluster allowing only for investigating stripe phases with a small unit cell observed experimentally at high doping levels @xmath29 and @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the hf approximation used here allows one to describe charge and spin modulation with larger unit cells and hence it should provide an answer to the important question whether the description of nio@xmath10 planes by the simplified effective @xmath0 model described below yields results consistent with the predictions of the ct model.@xcite an important aspect of these studies , qualitatively different from the pioneering work on the cuprates where the relevant models yield dws with _ nonmagnetic _",
    "cu@xmath64 ions,@xcite is that dws in the nickelates are formed of ni@xmath64 ions carrying a _",
    "spin @xmath66 leading to a fm polarization around them .    in this work",
    "we investigate various stripe phases resulting from an effective hamiltonian for @xmath0 electrons relevant to the nio@xmath10 layers , and compare them with those obtained in the doubly degenerate hubbard ( ddh ) model .",
    "we use the hf approximation in order to gain the qualitative insight into possible stripe phases and their stability .",
    "this approach is the first step to make in order to identify possible generic instabilities towards stripe phases in nio@xmath10 planes , in analogy to the early work on cuo@xmath10 planes which predicted the existence of stripes in the high @xmath72 cuprates.@xcite the hf method is well suited to compare the energies of different types of magnetically ordered phases , as it approaches the same limit at @xmath73 as better mean - field theories , such as slave - boson approach or the gutzwiller ansatz.@xcite in addition , the hf approach allows one for efficient calculations on large clusters at low temperatures which are necessary to obtain unbiased results concerning the stability of various stripe phases , particularly when the magnetic ( and charge ) unit cells are large at low doping .",

    "even though doped nickelate lsno is isostructural to its cuprate counterpart lsco , the electronic degrees of freedom in lsno are more involved . in fact , a minimal realistic hamiltonian for lsno must contain , besides the @xmath68 orbital states included in the cuprate oxide models , also the @xmath71 orbital states .",
    "such a model of interacting @xmath0 electrons in a 2d ( @xmath74 ) plane may be written as follows , @xmath75 with two orbital flavors , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , forming a basis in the orbital space .",

    "filling one piece of the fermi surface is building a `` swiss cross '' , while the second one is building a square .",
    "the filling of the upper band is then by 1/4 electron , while that of the lower band is by 3/4 electron per spin .",
    "the fermi surface of the upper band shrinks rather fast with increasing doping @xmath15 and below @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) one finds that this band is empty and all electrons are in the lower band . however , both bands are partly filled in the doping regime @xmath2 relevant for the nickelates , and they will both play a role also when electron interactions are included .    at half filling the edges of the pieces of the fermi surface ( fs ) for both bands",
    "are connected by the nesting vectors : @xmath113 and @xmath114 . at the same time , the edges of one piece are connected to the edges of the other one by the nesting vector @xmath115 . in addition , at half filling both components of the velocities vanish on their respective fermi surfaces .",
    "therefore , several competing instabilities are expected once the interaction is turned on .",
    "their relative importance can be estimated by computing the spin - spin correlation function in the noninteracting limit for the corresponding wave - vectors .",

    "here one finds a distinct difference between the present @xmath0 model and the ddh model , where instead the fs is nested and takes the shape of a square for both bands at the van hove point ( for @xmath127 ) .",

    "first of all , one finds that the energies of bc phases are considerably lower for the realistic model of @xmath0 band due to the higher kinetic energy gains which result from the off - diagonal hopping.@xcite most importantly , for the parameters relevant to lsno used for the data of table  [ tab : fez0 ] , one finds that the dbc phase has the lowest energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , indeed experimentally observed _ filled _ diagonal stripes . in contrast , the sc stripe phases with unpolarized dw sites and large double occupancies have much higher energies , and the best of them is not diagonal , but vertical ( horizontal ) one .",
    "we also note that even though the ddh model with two equivalent orbitals clearly favors diagonal dws , it stabilizes instead of filled the _ half - filled _ diagonal phases .",
    "cccccc & & & model & phase & filled & half - filled & filled & half - filled @xmath0 & bc & * 2.5508 * & 2.5759 & 2.5629 & 2.5756 & sc & 2.7815 & 3.2615 & * 2.7012 * & 3.0729 ddh & bc & 2.8172 & * 2.8135 * & 2.8395 & 2.8354      as in the cuprates , the coexisting charge and magnetic order in diagonal stripe phases in the nickelates is a result of the compromise between the kinetic and magnetic energies  the magnetic energy is gained in the af domains , and the kinetic energy is gained mainly along the dws .",
    "the bc stripes are favored as then the magnetic energy can be gained ( table [ tab : fez0 ] ) not only in the af domains , but also on the dw magnetic sites . finally ,",
    "when the dws are filled , more kinetic energy is gained in the @xmath0 model while then the off - diagonal hopping is allowed .",
    "altogether , this mechanism shows little sensitivity to the small crystal field splitting . for moderate values of the latter it tends to eliminate stripe phases entirely rather than promoting one stripe phase over another one .    in spite of the remarkable success of the present study which gave stable diagonal stripe phases , one has to admit that the predicted electronic properties show some difference to the experimental ones .",
    "in fact , our systematic studies of stripe phases completed within the relevant model for @xmath0 orbitals , where several phases separated by different lattice spacing varying from @xmath187 to @xmath235 were considered , have revealed that the optimal stripe filling in the true ground state is slightly less ( @xmath236 hole / ni depending on the crystal field splitting ) than the experimental value of one hole per ni ion .",
    "this concerns the entire low doping regime , @xmath237 , where @xmath19 .",
    "there may be a few reasons of this discrepancy .",
    "first of all , one has to realize that in a multiband model with oxygen orbitals included explicitly the holes would be doped primarily to oxygen orbitals , screening the local moments at ni sites,@xcite in analogy to zhang - rice singlets in the cuprates.@xcite an insulating ground state could then result from oxygen distortions by the peierls mechanism .",
    "thus , we argue that the present results could be further improved within a realistic model including not only two @xmath0 orbitals with different hopping elements , but also orbital polarization at oxygen sites .",
    "second , it may be expected that the stripe filling will be somewhat changed due to the electron correlation effects beyond the hf approximation used here .",
    "we believe that the present work provides a good starting point for future studies of the correlation effects .",
    "in summary we have analyzed the stripe formation in the doped nickelates in the realistic model with degeneracy of @xmath0 orbitals , using large clusters .",
    "the results obtained with this model were compared with the widely used doubly degenerate hubbard model .",
    "even though in both models the distance between the dw is inversely proportional to the doping , the most stable diagonal stripes are found to differ markedly from one model to the other one . in the @xmath0 model ,",
    "the stripes are filled and nearly insulating , as observed experimentally in a series of layered nickelates .",
    "in contrast , in the ddh model they are half - filled and metallic .",
    "these latter stripe phases are reminiscent of the stripes observed experimentally in largely doped cuprates .",
    "these differences have their roots in the different structure of intersite hopping terms .",
    "as the ddh model is closer to @xmath153 than to @xmath0 hopping matrix elements , one might expect that doped insulators with @xmath153 orbital degrees of freedom , as in vanadates or in ruthenates , would promote different stripe phases than those observed in the nickelates .",
