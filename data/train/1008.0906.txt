    "the main goal of the miniboone experiment@xcite at fermilab is to confirm or reject the lsnd oscillation signal@xcite .",
    "the lsnd experiment claimed a @xmath3 appearance signal from @xmath4 beam by @xmath5 decay at rest ( @xmath640  mev ) , and this corresponds to @xmath7  ev@xmath8 .",
    "the miniboone oscillation analysis in neutrino mode rejected this @xmath9@xcite@xmath10 because miniboone did not see the excess in the energy region where the lsnd signal is expected ( @xmath11  475  mev ) under two - neutrino massive model .",
    "however the first oscillation result had unexplained excess at low energy region ( @xmath12  475  mev ) .",
    "this was confirmed after a year long reanalysis@xcite .",
    "this signal can not be understood from the three - neutrino massive model , but can be understood with a lorentz violating neutrino oscillation model .",
    "especially , a neutrino oscillation model based on lorentz violation , the so called tandem model@xcite , predicted the low energy excess of miniboone .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to search for sidereal variation in these low energy excess events .",
    "the data set used in this analysis is limited to the neutrino mode .",
    "also , all the results presented here are preliminary .",
    "we used neutrino mode data from march 2003 to january 2006 , and october 2007 to april 2008 , corresponding to total of @xmath13 protons on target ( pot ) . in this data set , we found @xmath14 @xmath2 candidate events in the low energy region ( 200  mev@xmath15475  mev ) , and @xmath16 @xmath2 candidate events in the oscillation candidate energy region ( 475  mev@xmath151300  mev ) .    before we proceed to the extraction of standard - model extension ( sme ) parameters from our data set , we performed statistical tests to quantify any statistically significant time variations .",
    "we employed peason s @xmath17 ( p-@xmath17 ) test and the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test@xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : stattest ] .",
    "for the p-@xmath17 test , we chose the bin size so that the predicted number of events in each bin is greater than 5 .",
    "the ks test is performed on the unbinned data set to maximize the statistical power .",
    "there are 4 data sets , the low energy data sample and the oscillation candidate energy data sample , each of which include gm time distribution and sidereal time distribution parts .",
    "none of the 4 data sets show statistically significant variation , in other words , all data sets are consistent with the flat hypothesis .",
    "although there is no statistically significant time variation in any of the data sets , small time variations are not rejected .",
    "so we continue to search for lorentz violation in our data sets .",
    "this analysis follows one performed by lsnd collaboration@xcite .",
    "we use the sme formalism in the neutrino sector@xcite . the effective hamiltonian written under the sme formalism",
    "is used to write down the neutrino oscillation formula , with the assumption that the neutrino baseline is short enough compared to the oscillation length ( short baseline approximation ) .",
    "then , we can get the following oscillation formula for the @xmath18 to @xmath2 appearance signal@xcite , @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the baseline of neutrinos , @xmath21 is the sidereal frequency ( = 2@xmath22/23h 56min 4.1s ) , and @xmath23 is the sidereal time .",
    "the 5 parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 depend on the sme coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30@xcite .",
    "we use the unbinned likelihood method to find these parameters .",
    "however , in these proceedings , fitting parameters are limited to the first 3 parameters ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ) .",
    "this 3 parameter fit can be interpreted as the case where nature only has cpt - odd lorentz violating coefficients .",
    "the fitting results for the low energy region data samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowe ] .",
    "the solutions are duplicated due to the nature of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : prob ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : lowe ] , one can see that only @xmath24 ( sidereal time independent term ) differs from zero with statistical significance .",
    "this means that the data favor the flat solution , and this is consistent with the flatness tests in previous section .",
    "also , the increase of goodness - of - fit after the unbinned likelihood fit is small ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this is expected because the flat hypothesis already provides a very good fit .",
    "the situation is slightly different for the oscillation candidate energy region .",
    "since the excess itself is small , all parameters are statistically consistent with zero .",
    "= 5.0 in    finally , the sme coefficients with 1@xmath32 statistical errors are extrapolated from the fit results .",
    "note , 350  mev is used as an averaged neutrino energy for the low energy region data sample . from @xmath24 ,",
    "an extrapolation is performed assuming only one sme coefficient is nonzero . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are solved assuming two coefficients are nonzero .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : fitresult ] .",
    "we also calculate sme coefficients from the lsnd experiment@xcite .",
    "the 3 parameter fit result from lsnd has 2 solutions in 1@xmath32 area , but we accept the statistically significant solution .",
    "we used 40  mev for the averaged neutrino energy .    for the miniboone result",
    ", we can see @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are statistically significant from zero .",
    "this is the consequence of @xmath24 being nonzero from the 3 parameter fit result . on the other hand , since @xmath38 is nonzero for lsnd , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are statistically significant . since the miniboone result provides neutrino sme coefficients , and the lsnd result provides antineutrino sme coefficients , these two results are not inconsistent .    in conclusion",
    ", we performed a search for lorentz violation in the miniboone low energy excess sample .",
    "we discovered that the time independent solution is favored . to complete the analysis",
    ", we are planning a study of systematic errors .",
    "we also plan to extend this analysis to the antineutrino mode .",
    "this is very interesting because the antineutrino mode has an excess in the oscillation candidate energy region@xcite .",
    "we thank ben jones for a careful reading of this manuscript ."
