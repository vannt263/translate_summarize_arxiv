    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations allow for analysis and understanding of the dynamical behaviour of molecular systems .",
    "however realistic simulations on timescales beyond microseconds are still infeasible even on the most powerful general purpose computers , which renders the md - based analysis of many biological equilibrium processes , that are often rare compared to the characteristic time scale of the system and hence require prohibitively long simulations , impossible .",
    "the hallmark of these rare events is that the average waiting time between the events is orders of magnitude longer than the timescale of the switching event itself .",
    "thus rare event simulation and estimation are among the most challenging topics in molecular dynamics .",
    "the molecular dynamics literature on rare event simulations is rich . since direct numerical equilibrium simulation",
    "is infeasible , all available techniques try to sample from the rare event statistics by biasing the system in one or the other way .",
    "roughly speaking , we can distinguish between two major classes of sampling techniques : class @xmath0 consists of splitting methods that decompose state space , but are still essentially based on an equilibrium distribution , whereas methods from class @xmath1 proceed by driving the system under consideration into a nonequilibrium regime that changes the rare events statistics . for a general overview of monte - carlo methods for rare events in other application fields ,",
    "we refer to the textbook @xcite .",
    "the list of methods in class @xmath0 range from reaction - coordinate based techniques via path - space oriented techniques to approaches based on interface sampling or generalized dynamics .",
    "reaction - coordinate based techniques consider the marginal of the equilibrium distribution in some low - dimensional collective variables like in direct free energy calculations @xcite ; they suffer from the fact that appropriate reaction coordinates are often not available .",
    "path - space oriented techniques approximate the most important reaction paths that govern the rare event statistics either by sampling distribution of reactive paths like in transition path sampling ( tps ) @xcite or by optimizing an appropriate path functional like in the string method @xcite ; they become problematic if the path space distribution is multi - modal or generally too complex ( e.g. , involving bifurcations ) .",
    "interface sampling techniques like milestoning @xcite or forward flux sampling ( ffs ) @xcite place a set of suitably chosen interfaces in state space between the initial and final state and use them to follow the transition of the system in an iterative manner using equilibrium trajectories that connect neighbouring interfaces . the idea of _ generalized dynamics _ such as hyperdynamics @xcite , metadynamics @xcite , conformational flooding @xcite , or the adaptive biasing force ( abf ) method @xcite is to bias the system on - the - fly ( e.g. , by filling in certain energy wells in which the system got trapped during a simulation ) so as to enhance rare transitions between metastable states .",
    "although seemingly different , generalized dynamics belong to class @xmath0 , in that they only alter the underlying equilibrium distribution along a predefined set of low - dimensional collective variables .",
    "although these methods have proven to be very efficient , they require that the interesting processes can be described by a few collective coordinates that have to be known in advance .",
    "class @xmath1 consists of methods based on the jarzynski and crooks formulae @xcite that relate the equilibrium helmholtz free energy to the nonequilibrium work exerted under external forcing .",
    "instances of nonequilibrium simulations that mimic experiments on controlling and manipulating single molecules ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are single - molecule pulling @xcite , steered molecular dynamics @xcite or bridge sampling @xcite , to mention just a few .",
    "the corresponding path functionals have the form of cumulant - generating functions for the exerted work @xcite which poses immense challenges to monte - carlo simulations and limits the usability of the formulae in practice . roughly speaking ,",
    "the usability is limited by the fact that the likelihood ratio between equilibrium and nonequilibrium trajectories is highly degenerate , for the overwhelming majority of nonequilibrium forcings generate trajectories that have almost zero weight with respect to the equilibrium distribution that is relevant for the rare event ; cf .",
    "also the discussion in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the underlying idea is appealing and a cleverly designed external force may speed up the sampling of the rare events by biasing the equilibrium distribution of the system towards a distribution under which the rare events is no longer rare , while giving numerical estimators that are useful in terms of variance and convergence properties .",
    "the method presented in this article belongs to the latter class , but shares somes ideas with ideas from class @xmath0 .",
    "it takes up the idea that external forcings can speed up the rare event but avoids sampling issues related to nonequilibrium processes . instead it uses optimal nonequilibrium forcing in connection with splitting methods such as ffs or milestoning , in the sense that the new method uses interfaces to follow the transition of an _ optimally driven _",
    "system where the external forcing that drives the system from one interface to the next results in a considerable speed - up compared to ffs or milestoning .",
    "specifically , the new method replaces the path sampling problem using an exponential change of measure that can be explicitly computed by minimizing a cross - entropy - like functional , which then yields the optimal forcing .",
    "although the minimization involves solving an optimal control problem , the numerical effort can be drastically reduced when the minimization is done in a clever way ; one reason is that the path functional becomes linear after the change of measure whereas it was exponential in the original cumulant - generating function .",
    "transformations based on exponential change of measures have a rich tradition in the ( risk - sensitive ) optimal control literature @xcite and the theory of large deviations @xcite , and are regularly rediscovered  mostly aiming at turning certain optimal control problems into linearly solvable sampling problems @xcite ; cf .",
    "also @xcite . here",
    "we pursue the reversed strategy and turn a difficult rare event estimation problem into an optimal control problem that can be solved by minimizing a suitable functional .",
    "thus the basic outline of the new method is : iteratively determine the optimal nonequilibrium forcing by an optimization procedure based on milestoning ideas that avoid path - space sampling and compute the equilibrium rare event statistics from the optimal nonequilibrium forcing .    besides introducing the new method",
    "the purpose of this article is to explain the basic ideas of how to use optimal control for the estimation and simulation of rare events .",
    "therefore we present only the simplest possible scenario ( a particle following an overdamped langevin dynamics in a conservative force field ) , without paying too much attention to complete generality or mathematical rigour .",
    "the first issue in section [ sec : free ] then is to introduce the variational characterization of ( generalized ) free enregy and the exponential change of measures that are the basis of our optimal control approach",
    ". the precise formulation of the optimal control problem , a stochastic control problem with quadratic control costs and an indefinite time horizon , is given in section [ sec : ocp ] . in section",

    "<S> rare event simulation and estimation for systems in equilibrium are among the most challenging topics in molecular dynamics . as was shown by jarzynski and others , nonequilibrium forcing can theoretically be used to obtain equilibrium rare event statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage seems to be that the external force can speed up the sampling of the rare events by biasing the equilibrium distribution towards a distribution under which the rare events is no longer rare . yet algorithmic methods based on jarzynski s and related results often fail to be efficient because they are based on sampling in path space . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new method that replaces the path sampling problem by minimization of a cross - entropy - like functional which boils down to finding the optimal nonequilibrium forcing . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to solve the related optimization problem in an efficient way by using an iterative strategy based on milestoning . </S>"
