    "as in previous 3d simulations ( @xcite ; ; ; @xcite ) , the fast , low - density wind of  carves a large cavity out of the slower , denser wind of  for most of the 5.54-year orbit . around apastron ( row  a of both figures )",
    "when orbital speeds are their lowest ( @xmath76  km  s@xmath8 for  with respect to the system com ) , this cavity and the wwc zone maintain the expected axisymmetric conical shape .",

    "the overall fraction of s wind shocked to high temperatures increases with @xmath4 .",
    "the areas where the post - shock  wind is hottest ( in bright yellow in rows a and b of figure  [ fig2 ] ) increase in size as @xmath4  is decreased .",
    "this is because for a given pre - shock wind speed , oblique shocks ( like those in case  a ) are less efficient at thermalizing the flow and produce lower post - shock temperatures @xcite .",
    "in contrast , cases  b and c have wwc zones that are more normal to the pre - shock flow , resulting in higher post - shock temperatures in the outer wings of the wwc region .",
    "the post - shock  wind region appears to become somewhat thinner and less dense the lower the value of @xmath4 .",
    "since the colliding winds have very different speeds there is a velocity shear across the cd that can excite kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities ( @xcite ; ) . the thin , dense and rapidly - cooling post - shock  wind is also subject to non - linear thin - shell instabilities ( ntsis , @xcite ; ) .",
    "as @xmath4  is decreased , the wwc zone seems to become more unstable .",
    "one possible reason for this is because the time scale for exponential growth of the kh instability is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the densities on the two sides of the cd @xcite .",
    "therefore , as @xmath4  is lowered , @xmath104 decreases and the growth timescale for the kh instability shortens .",
    "we note , however , that standard sph schemes are notorious for under - resolving the kh instability @xcite , so these results should be interpreted with caution . in the case of the ntsi ,",
    "the overall stability of a dense shell depends on the shell s thickness @xcite .",
    "the thicker , denser compressed ` shell ' of primary wind in case  a is thus probably less prone to the ntsi .    the aberration angle and degree of downstream curvature of the wwc zone",
    "are determined by the ratio of the orbital speed to the pre - shock wind speed @xcite .",
    "as the stars approach periastron , the orbital speed of  relative to  ( @xmath106  km  s@xmath8 ) increases to a value near its wind speed ( @xmath70  km  s@xmath8 ) , thus highly distorting the wwc zone ( figure  [ fig1 ] , rows b and c ) .",
    "the increasing orbital speeds furthermore cause the post - shock  gas in the leading arm of the wwc zone to be heated to higher temperatures than the gas in the trailing arm ( rows b and c of figure  [ fig2 ] ) , a result also found by .    because of",
    "the high orbital eccentricity , at @xmath107 ,  and the wwc apex become deeply embedded in s dense wind ( row  c of figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) . the rapid decrease in stellar separation at these phases and",
    "the adopted @xmath108 velocity laws cause the two winds to collide before s wind can reach its terminal speed .",
    "this , combined with radiative inhibition of s wind by , leads to a significant decrease in the pre - shock velocity of s wind ( compared to phases around apastron , see appendix  [ appenda ] ) . the associated drop in",
    "s wind momentum moves the wwc apex closer to  and decreases the wwc - zone s opening angle .",
    "because of these effects , the trailing wind of  is unable to collide with s downstream wind . as a result",
    ", the post - shock  wind in the trailing arm of the wwc zone cools below @xmath109  k , making the hot shock noticeably asymmetric just before and at periastron ( figure  2 , row  c ) .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath4 , the earlier this process starts , with the hot gas in the trailing arm vanishing at @xmath110 ( 0.995 ) in case  a ( case  c ) .",
    "there is also a `` collapse '' of the wwc zone around periastron ( see section  [ collapse ] for details ) .",
    "rapid orbital motion during periastron passage distorts the wwc region , giving it a distinct spiral shape that is clearly visible at @xmath111 ( figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , row d ) .",
    "the wind of  also carves a narrow , low - density spiral cavity in the back side of s wind .",
    "this cavity flows in the @xmath112 and @xmath113 directions following periastron ( rows d and e of figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the width of the cavity increases with decreasing @xmath4  due to the change in the wind momentum balance .",
    "the high - velocity  wind in the cavity also continuously ploughs into the denser , slower  wind that flows in the @xmath112 and @xmath113 directions .",
    "this makes the compressed wall or ` shell ' of  wind material grow in density and accelerate to speeds a few hundred km  s@xmath8 greater than @xmath114 .",
    "the lower the @xmath4 , the greater the outflow speed of the shell due to the more similar wind momenta .",
    "as the shell sweeps up more mass , it gradually slows to velocities comparable to @xmath114 .",
    "the thickness and density of the spiral shell of  wind also decrease with decreasing @xmath4 .    at @xmath115 ,",
    "the dense layer of post - shock  wind located in the trailing arm of the wwc region is photo - ablated by the intense stellar radiation fields .",
    "originally identified this photo - ablation in their 3d amr simulations .",
    "interestingly , only in case  a does the photo - ablation cut - off or ` snip ' the spiral tail of the  wind cavity ( row  d of figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this snipping - off of the cavity prevents the  wind from colliding with and heating the downstream  wind , causing a noticeable asymmetry in the temperature structure of the post - shock  gas in the spiral cavity . in case  a , only  wind that lies in the cavity in the forward direction remains hot , while material in the trailing direction cools to @xmath116  k. in cases  b and c the entire  wind cavity is hot , with @xmath117  k. the temperature asymmetry seen in case  a remains as the gas flows outward and is also visible at @xmath118 ( figure  [ fig2 ] , row e ) .",
    "recovery of the wwc zone following periastron takes longer the higher the value of @xmath4 . in case",
    "a , the hot -wind shock does not fully return until @xmath119 , whereas in case  c , the hot shock returns by @xmath120 ( see section  [ collapse ] for details ) .",

    "the arms of the wwc zone are so distorted by orbital motion that the leading arm collides with the old trailing arm formed before periastron passage .",
    "the lower the value of @xmath4 , the sooner this collision takes place .",
    "the leading arm of the wwc zone , including the portion that collides with the old trailing arm , helps form another compressed shell of  wind that flows in the @xmath123 and @xmath113 directions after periastron ( row  e ) .",
    "the higher the @xmath4 , the greater the mass in this shell and the slower it travels outward .",
    "eventually , orbital speeds decrease and the wwc zone and  wind cavity regain their axisymmetric conical shape as the system moves slowly back toward apastron .      and showed that radiative inhibition ( ri ) likely reduces the pre - shock velocity of s wind during periastron passage , resulting in lower post - shock temperatures and rapid cooling of the post - shock  gas .",
    "such rapid cooling can catastrophically disrupt the wwc zone via ntsis , leading to a `` collapse '' , with dense fragments of post - shock  wind being driven into the acceleration zone of s wind and sometimes colliding with  .",
    "it has been postulated that such a wwc collapse could explain s observed extended x - ray minima in 1998 and 2003 , with the shorter 2009 minimum caused by the lack of a collapse for some unknown reason (; ; @xcite ) .",
    "3d amr simulations of  by surprisingly did not show the expected collapse of the wwc zone around periastron .",
    "rapid orbital motion , which increases the pre - shock wind velocity and post - shock pressure of s wind , is one key factor that helped prevent a collapse . a second likely factor is the relatively weak coupling between s radiation field and s wind adopted for the simulations .",

    "since the recovery from the 2009 event , the @xmath233  kev x - ray flux has been @xmath234 below the level seen in the previous two cycles @xcite . a decrease in flux outside of the minimum",

    "if the extended x - ray minima of 1998 and 2003.5 were the result of a long cooling - transition phase , perhaps the shorter minimum in 2009 was the result of some change in the effectiveness of radiative cooling in s post - shock wind . a modest decrease in @xmath4  of @xmath234 ( or",

    "this should result in a detectable phase delay in when the x - ray lines become blueshifted and broader .",
    "the magnitude of this delay will be proportional to the increase in wwc opening angle .",
    "s _ rxte _ light curve also exhibits short - term rapid variations in brightness or `` flares '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "these flares become more frequent and shorter in duration as periastron is approached .",
    "@xcite presented a series of models for explaining the flares , their preferred model consisting of large stochastic wind clumps from  that enter and compress the hard x - ray - emitting wwc zone . as an alternative",
    ", they considered that the flares are the result of instabilities intrinsic to the wwc zone .",
    "indicate that such instabilities , especially if combined with a clumpy lbv wind , may be a viable explanation for the x - ray flares .",
    "the sph simulations suggest that a decrease in the value of @xmath4  leads to a more unstable , clumpy wwc region .",
    "a decrease in @xmath4  would therefore result in a higher flare frequency , especially as periastron is approached .",
    "the relative duration and amplitude of the flares may also change , although detailed numerical modeling is required to test this .",
    "an increase in the opening angle of the wwc zone combined with a shortened cooling - transition phase during periastron passage might explain the shortened duration of the 2009 x - ray minimum . however , these effects may not necessarily be a result of a drop in @xmath4 .",
    "a comparable increase in the @xmath17  and/or @xmath39 of s wind would also increase the wwc opening angle .",
    "one argument against a recent increase in the @xmath39 of s wind is that such a change should increase the x - ray hardness at all phases .",
    "however , the x - ray hardness appears to have declined somewhat between 2004 and 2009 .",
    "a significant increase in the @xmath17  of  is harder to quantify since the densities in the post - shock  wind would increase , affecting the x - ray emission measure .",
    "recent flux measures are lower compared to previous cycles , suggesting a decrease in the emission measure of the shocked  wind .",
    "one argument against an increase in s @xmath17  is that such an increase should strengthen the effectiveness of radiative cooling in the post - shock wind at phases close to periastron .",
    "one would then expect a longer cooling - transition phase that leads to a longer minimum , as opposed to the observed shorter minimum . finally , a decrease in stellar radius or change in the velocity - law profile ( e.g. @xmath41 ) of  could also allow its wind to reach higher pre - shock velocities without drastically altering @xmath39 , moving the wwc zone closer to  and again decreasing the effectiveness of radiative cooling during periastron passage . such changes could in principle produce a shortened x - ray minimum compared to previous cycles , although the physical reasons for a sudden alteration of s stellar parameters seem inexplicable .",
    "numerical simulations investigating s stellar / wind parameters are needed in order to determine if such changes can explain the x - ray observations .",
    "somewhat related to the x - ray emission is the peculiar behavior of the ii @xmath237 emission around periastron @xcite .",
    "the ii @xmath237 line intensity increases suddenly by a factor of ten just before phase @xmath176 and then drops sharply to zero , after which it recovers to a second peak in intensity before declining back to zero again .",
    "a highly luminous source of he@xmath247-ionizing photons with @xmath248  ev is required for the formation of this line .",
    "the necessary soft x - rays are thought to come from the shocked  wind , while the ii  @xmath237 emission is hypothesized to originate in the  wind just before the wwc and/or in the cold , dense post - shock  wind @xcite .",
    "earlier alternative explanations in which the ii @xmath237 arises in the wind of  can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the ii emission behaved differently during the 2009 spectroscopic event and included a second intensity peak just after periastron that was not present during the 2003 event .",
    "however , @xcite claim that a second ii peak was present during the 2003 event , and that the two events were not drastically different . in any case , both @xcite and @xcite support a scenario in which there is a wwc ` collapse ' during periastron that helps explain the behavior of the ii @xmath237 line .",
    "a wwc disruption seems necessary to explain the fact that the ii behavior is remarkably similar for both reflected spectra from the polar region of  and a direct view of the central stars @xcite .      before elaborating on how the ii emission should change",
    "if there is a large drop in @xmath4 , it is important to clarify how / where the ii emission forms in , and why the equivalent width ( ew ) behaves the way it does around periastron ( see e.g. figure  4 of @xcite or figure  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "some of the ideas below have been discussed in @xcite ; and @xcite , to which we refer the reader for details .",
    "however , we present several new concepts that are crucial for understanding the formation of the observed ii @xmath237 emission and its dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite ; and @xcite , the low - density pre - shock wind of , the acceleration region of the wind of , and the post - shock wind of  can all easily be excluded as the source of the ii  @xmath237 emission , based simply on energy and density requirements . while it is often assumed that the ii emission arises in the dense wind of , two key remaining questions are ( 1 ) why is strong ii emission only observed between @xmath250 to @xmath251 and ( 2 ) how / where do the required he@xmath247 ions form ?    according to figure  9 of , for @xmath252 , helium is _ neutral _ in the dense wind of  ( assuming @xmath253  yr@xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore , under normal circumstances , there can be no ii emission for most of s cycle since there is no he@xmath247 near the wwc zone to be ionized .",
    "moreover , for most of the orbit , soft x - rays formed in the wwc zone can not penetrate the dense primary wind that lies between  and the small he@xmath247 zone at @xmath254 .",
    "there is no other known source of photons capable of ionizing the inner  he@xmath247 zone .",
    "one might try to argue that radiation from the wwc shocks ionizes the neutral helium in s wind located near the wwc region .",
    "however , the wwc shocks are unsuitable for this since the @xmath255  km  s@xmath8 shocked wind of  produces mainly hard x - rays with energies above @xmath68  ev , while the @xmath70  km  s@xmath8 wind of  produces photons with energies on the order of a few hundred ev .",
    "both are highly inefficient for ionizing neutral helium , and only the shocked wind of  is suitable for providing photons to ionize he@xmath247 .    the only other possible source of neutral - helium ionizing photons at times away from periastron is .",
    "as noted by @xcite and @xcite , during most of the binary orbit ,  _ may _ photoionize neutral helium in a small region of the pre - shock  wind located just beyond the wwc zone ( similar to figure  12 of @xcite ) emission .",
    "detailed 3d radiative transfer simulations are needed to test this though . ] .",
    "neutral helium in portions of the colder , denser post - shock  wind would also be ionized by .",
    "the he@xmath247 in the dense post - shock  wind will very quickly recombine , producing i emission .",
    "some of the he@xmath247 in the lower - density , pre - shock  wind would also recombine and create i emission @xcite .",
    "however , we suggest that _ if _  can photoionize neutral helium in the pre - shock wind of , some of the resulting he@xmath247 will be additionally ionized by soft x - rays created in the colliding  wind , producing a very small amount of ii  @xmath237 emission at times away from periastron . the amount of ii emission is likely to be small because of the lower densities in the pre - shock  wind near the wwc region , and because of the likely very small volume of he@xmath247 created by s radiation .",
    "this is consistent with the observations and explains why little to no ii  @xmath237 emission is detected during most of s 5.54-year cycle @xcite .",
    "earlier proposed scenarios for the ii  @xmath237 emission also have difficulty explaining the emission peaks observed just prior to and after periastron . here",
    "we present a new , simple explanation for these peaks .",
    "figure  9 of shows that he@xmath247 exists in s wind only between @xmath256 and @xmath257 ( @xmath258  au ) .",
    "the densities in this region ( @xmath259  @xmath260 ) are capable of explaining the observed ii emission if the he@xmath247 can be ionized by soft x - rays .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath261  ev photons needed to ionize the he@xmath247 come from the post - shock  wind , we find that for most of s orbit , the wwc zone is too far from s he@xmath247 zone to produce any ii emission ( figure  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "plotting the separation between  and the wwc apex as a function of phase assuming the parameters in table  1 , we see that only for @xmath262 does the wwc apex penetrate into the he@xmath247 zone of  ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig11 ] ) . therefore , the soft x - rays from the wwc region can ionize the he@xmath247 only during these times .",
    "this is almost _ exactly _ the same range of spectroscopic phases that strong ii  @xmath237 emission is detected .",
    "furthermore , this is roughly the same range of phases that the post - shock  wind is in the radiative - cooling regime . during this time",
    ", the post - shock  will also produce photons capable of ionizing he@xmath247 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite speculated that high densities in the post - shock  gas around periastron could lead to a switchover to the radiative - cooling regime , which would make the wwc zone unstable and collapse , and lead to the increased generation of the soft x - rays required to form ii . according to our sph simulations ,",
    "a complete wwc collapse is not required for the additional generation of soft x - rays to ionize he@xmath247 .",
    "a mass - ejection event , accretion by , and/or changes to a latitudinally - dependent primary wind @xcite are also not required .",
    "_ instead , we suggest that the strong _ ii _  @xmath237 emission arises in the inner he@xmath247 zone of s dense wind and that the first peak in ew observed just before the spectroscopic event ( @xmath263 ) is due to a combination of two important effects ; ( 1 ) penetration of the wwc region into the he@xmath247 zone of  that allows soft x - rays generated in the wwc zone to ionize the he@xmath247 and ( 2 ) a switchover of the post - shock wind of  to the radiative - cooling regime that results in additional soft x - rays that can ionize the he@xmath247 and produce extra _ ii _ emission . _ the fact that the timing of both matches almost perfectly with the observed first ii peak provides strong support for our scenario .",
    "the sharp drop in ii ew at @xmath264 may be due , at least in part , to a physical collapse of the wwc zone at periastron .",
    "we further suggest that the second , smaller emission peak in ii  @xmath237 that occurs @xmath265  days after @xmath266 represents the period just after perisatron when  returns to our side of the system and begins to carve a new cavity within s wind .",
    "during this time , the wwc zone may still be highly unstable , but two important facts will remain .",
    "namely , the wwc region will be within the he@xmath247 zone of  and the post - shock wind of  will be in the radiative - cooling regime and supplying additional soft x - rays to produce ii",
    ". the decreased height of the second ii peak could be due to a combination of instability in the wwc zone and increased optical depth in los caused by the dense  wind that flows in the apastron direction during periastron passage .",
    "the ii behavior should look relatively similar for both a direct view of the central source and reflected spectra corresponding to high stellar latitudes , with some possible changes in the line profiles .      if @xmath4  is lowered to @xmath267  yr@xmath8 , keeping the other stellar and wind parameters constant , 1d ` cmfgen `",

    "the first ii peak should therefore also appear @xmath272  days earlier .",
    "while this first peak may appear earlier , its initial amplitude may not be as large .",
    "this is because a lower @xmath4  produces a shorter cooling - transition phase in s post - shock wind , resulting in the generation of less soft x - rays to ionize the he@xmath247 .",
    "therefore , an initial , broad ii peak could begin at @xmath271 , created when the wwc apex penetrates the he@xmath247 zone and the soft x - rays formed in the post - shock  wind produce ii emission .",
    "another sharper peak could then occur near @xmath273 when s wind switches to the radiative - cooling regime and produces an additional burst of soft x - rays to further ionize the he@xmath247 and create additional ii emission . since the wwc zone will be more stable in a lower @xmath4  situation , the sharp drop in ii ew near @xmath266",
    "may be delayed , while the recovery to a second ii peak after periastron may be sped up . because the wwc zone will remain in the he@xmath247 zone longer after periastron , the height and duration of the second ii peak should both increase .",

    "this and the fact that the sharp drop in x - rays also occurred nearly 2023  days after the 2003 periaston very strongly suggest that there was no large decrease of @xmath4  before 2009 . as the available observations make it unclear whether a second ii peak occurred during the 2003 event",

    "observed latitudinal changes in the line profiles during periastron , specifically the appearance of strong p - cygni absorption in los , is explained by the flow of dense primary wind toward the observer for a brief period when  is behind  at periastron ( g12a , b ; @xcite , see also rows c and d of figures  [ fig2 ] and [ figb1 ] ) .",

    "thus , there is an effective shutting - off of the uv flux from  as it becomes temporarily enshrouded in the dense , extended wind of  around periastron .",
    "therefore , during the 2003.5 event , @xmath4  was large enough to significantly reduce the size of the photoionization region created by , from a few thousand au across to just several au wide .",
    "an @xmath4  @xmath69  yr@xmath8 is consistent with this result , assuming  is an o5 giant with @xmath305  k and an h@xmath306 ionizing flux of @xmath307  photons  s@xmath8 ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "a factor of four drop in @xmath4  would create a much larger photoionization region during periastron passage ( e.g. middle panel of figure  [ fig13 ] ) , resulting in large amounts of high - ionization forbidden line emission .    in order to avoid a large photoionization region at @xmath308 with such a low @xmath4",
    ", one must drastically reduce the number of ionizing photons from , by a factor of @xmath309 ( right panel of figure  [ fig13 ] ) .",
    "this has important implications for the spectral type of . according to @xcite",
    ", there are no o - type giants or supergiants with hydrogen ionizing fluxes near @xmath310  photons  s@xmath8 .",
    "rather , an o8.5 @xmath311 o9 main sequence star would be required , with a @xmath312  k @xmath313  k and @xmath314 @xcite .",
    "however , such a star lies outside the range of acceptable candidates for  from both the works of @xcite and @xcite ( see their figure  12 ) .",
    "thus , a large drop in @xmath4  should reveal itself in the broad forbidden line emission during s next periastron passage in 2014 .",
    "if not , the implication is either ( 1 ) @xmath4  has not dropped significantly since 2004 or ( 2 ) our current understanding of  is incorrect and the star has a lower effective temperature and hydrogen ionizing flux .",
    "another major issue regarding the forbidden line emission concerns the population of available fe@xmath247 to be photoionized to fe@xmath315 by  so that [ fe  iii ] emission can form .",
    "it is generally accepted that the energy required to ionize fe@xmath247 to fe@xmath315 comes from photons provided by  @xcite .",
    "thus , the iron in any [ fe  iii ] emitting region needs to initially be in the fe@xmath247 state . show that the ionization structure of s wind and the amount of fe@xmath247 present depend strongly on charge exchange processes between fe@xmath315 and neutral h via the reaction fe@xmath315 + h @xmath316 fe@xmath247 + h@xmath247 .",
    "according to figure  9 of , which assumes @xmath4  @xmath317  @xmath318 , fe@xmath247 is the dominant ionization state of iron for radii @xmath319  au in s wind . below this , higher ionization states dominate .",
    "however , in ` cmfgen ` models of  that assume @xmath4  @xmath320  @xmath318 ( with the other parameters held fixed ) , h recombination never occurs and the iron is primarily fe@xmath315 in the outer wind . discuss this issue and use it as a reason for favoring a higher @xmath4 , as it provides a better fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "thus , if @xmath4  were to drop to @xmath321  @xmath318 , fe@xmath315 would be the dominant ionization state of iron in the outer  wind .",
    "would then be unnecessary for [ fe  iii ] emission to form , provided the  wind is in the right density and temperature regimes and has not recombined to fe@xmath247 or been excited to higher states .",
    "this has a number of major ramifications .",
    "first , while a hot  would not be necessary for [ fe  iii ] emission , s uv flux would be necessary for forming the other observed higher ionization lines of [ ne  iii ] and [ ar  iii ] @xcite .",
    "a large drop in @xmath4  would hence lead to huge differences between the wind structures observed in lines like [ ar  iii ] and those of [ fe  iii ] .    secondly ,",
    "if fe@xmath315 became the dominant state of iron , then broad , _ red - shifted _ [ fe  iii ] emission would become observable in most directions for most of the binary orbit , arising in the periastron side of s wind and portions of the wwc region that are moving away from the observer . more importantly , the broad [ fe  iii ] emission would not completely vanish during periastron passage .",
    "the sudden appearance of large amounts of [ fe  ii ] emission during periastron passage , as previously observed @xcite , would also not occur .",
    "if the photoionization region extended far enough , the narrow high - ionization lines that arise in the weigelt blobs and which also vanish during periastron would remain visible as well .",
    "it is conceivable that in such a low @xmath4  situation , the fe@xmath315 in  wind that gets compressed in the wwc regions will recombine to fe@xmath247 .",
    "such material on the  side of the system could then be photoionized to reform fe@xmath315 and allow [ fe  iii ] emission .",
    "iron in the dense shells of compressed primary wind on the periastron side of  created during periastron passage could also recombine to fe@xmath247 .",
    "as these shells would be shielded from s radiation , the gas in them would remain in the fe@xmath247 state and produce broad red - shifted [ fe  ii ] emission .",
    "however , the uncompressed  wind would still consist of fe@xmath315 and exhibit significant amounts of broad red - shifted [ fe  iii ] emission .",
    "this emission would appear at nearly all phases in directions to the southeast on the sky at doppler velocities up to @xmath114 .",
    "the latest _ hst _",
    "observations show no such emission @xcite . however , future _ hst _ observations of the forbidden lines could help constrain any new changes to @xmath4 .",
    "a major benefit of studying the extended , broad forbidden line structures is that they provide an excellent record of s mass - loss over the past @xmath1 orbital cycles ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are other observable changes expected from a large decrease in @xmath4  that are worth briefly mentioning .",
    "first , a drop in @xmath4  could affect any periodic dust formation during periastron passage , as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "a large decrease in @xmath4  would decrease the density in the compressed wwc zone where dust is expected to form , leading to a decrease in the near - ir flux and/or changes to the spectral energy distribution .",
    "an overall decrease in primary wind density and wwc - region density could also allow the intense radiation from the stars to more easily destroy any dust that forms .",
    "older dust that lies in extended regions farther from the stars could also be destroyed or heated if intense radiation flowing through the wwc cavity can reach it .",
    "this may help explain the recent decrease in extinction and increase in brightness of the central source in los , e.g. an increase in wwc opening angle that allows more radiation to escape in los and destroy dust between us and the stars , thereby altering the extinction in los .",
    "the wavelength - dependent apparent size of  is also controlled by the wavelength- and radially - dependent opacity and emissivity , which depend on @xmath4  .",
    "as @xmath4  drops , the continuum extension of  in the optical and near - ir should drop as well . in other words ,  should appear smaller than it was when observed between 2003 and 2004 @xcite .",
    "continuum flux changes at a given wavelength that occur when the apex of the wwc cavity penetrates the surface of optical depth @xmath322 ( e.g. the  bore - hole  effect , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would also be affected , changing the behavior of the optical and near - ir photometric eclipse - like events observed to occur every 5.54-years around periastron @xcite .",
    "a reduced @xmath4  should cause the eclipse - like events to start later due to the longer time it takes for the wwc cavity to reach optical depth @xmath322 in the wind photosphere of .",
    "similarly , the events should end earlier as the apex recedes from the location of optical depth @xmath322 . for low enough @xmath4  ( @xmath323  @xmath318 ) the wwc cavity would never penetrate s optically - thick wind photosphere and the photometric eclipse - like events would very likely cease .",
    "as of the writing of this paper , no significant decrease in the apparent continuum extension of  in the near - ir has been observed .",
    "no major differences are seen between the 2003.5 and 2009 events in the ground - based optical photometry either @xcite .",
    "using 3d sph simulations , we showed that @xmath4  has profound effects on the 3d time - dependent hydrodynamics of s binary colliding winds on a wide range of spatial scales .",
    "these simulations lay the foundation for future work generating synthetic data that can be compared directly to past and future observations of .",
    "such modeling provides information that is important for helping constrain s recent mass - loss history and possible future state .",
    "the 3d sph simulations and 1d ` cmfgen ` models of s spectra show that for the range of explored values , a factor of two or more drop in @xmath4  results in substantial changes to numerous observables across a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "below we summarize the most important changes expected .    1 .   for @xmath4  @xmath324  @xmath318 , our los intersects portions of the dense , outer wwc region . for lower @xmath4  ( by factors of two or more ) , our los passes primarily through the wind cavity carved by .",
    "an increase in wwc opening angle may thus explain the observed brightening of the system and changes to various wind - emission line profiles seen in los , with little to no changes at high stellar latitudes or at the weigelt blobs .",
    "2 .   increases in wwc opening angle cause lines - of - sight to the wwc apex to move into s dense wind at later @xmath162 as the system goes into periastron , and to move out of s wind at earlier @xmath162 as the system leaves periastron . combined with the decreased cooling - transition phase of s post - shock wind",
    ", the net result is a shorter x - ray minimum ( by @xmath231  days ) during periastron passage for simulation cases  b and c , versus case  a. 3 .",
    "a decrease in @xmath4  leads to a corresponding drop in x - ray flux at phases far from periastron .",
    "decreases in @xmath4  also propagate into s extended interacting winds and may change the thermalization and/or absorption of the cce component .",
    "4 .   increases in wwc opening angle cause the trailing arm of hot post - shock  gas to cross the observer s los at later @xmath162 as the system approaches periastron , delaying when the strongest observed x - ray lines become increasingly blueshifted and broader .",
    "as @xmath4  is lowered , the spatial extent of the he@xmath247 zone in s dense inner wind increases considerably , altering the timing of the emission peaks observed in ii @xmath237 around periastron . assuming an initial @xmath325  @xmath318 , a factor of four drop should lead to the detection of significant ii emission at all orbital phases .",
    "a factor of two drop should change the timing of the ii event , with the first peak occurring @xmath141  months earlier and the second peak lasting @xmath326  months longer . 6 .",
    "an increase in wwc opening angle will greatly affect broad wind - emission features of h@xmath31 , h@xmath41 , and ii lines .",
    "the amount of balmer p - cygni absorption in los will be reduced and possibly entirely absent .",
    "the latitudinal and azimuthal variation of the balmer p - cygni absorption will also change . for @xmath327  @xmath318",
    ", there could be little to no absorption in reflected spectra over the stellar poles of .",
    "the observed increase in balmer p - cygni absorption in los during s spectroscopic events should decrease for decreased @xmath4 .",
    "the density and amount of primary wind that flows toward the observer during periastron passage will also decrease . for @xmath327  @xmath318 ,",
    "the absorption in los during the events should vanish since  will be able to easily ionize hydrogen throughout its extended wind .",
    "a decrease in @xmath4  by a factor of @xmath238 should decrease the emission strength of h@xmath31 , h@xmath41 , and h@xmath32 by a factor of @xmath1 . the broad fe ii / cr ii blend between 4570 and 4600 and",
    "other fe ii lines should practically vanish .",
    "such changes should be visible not only in los , but also at high stellar latitudes and in other spatial directions , such as at the weigelt blobs",
    ". 9 .   given the extremely large uv - emitting region of , large changes in wwc half - opening angle of @xmath328 will alter the observed uv spectrum .",
    "detailed 2d radiative transfer models of the resulting spectrum are needed , but current 1d models show that a factor of four drop in @xmath4  reduces both the emission and absorption of lines between 1250 and 1450 , and increases the emission strength of lines between 1390 and 1410 .",
    "the observed broad forbidden line emission depends strongly on @xmath4  and the ionizing flux from . as @xmath4  drops , the size of the photoionization region where the highest ionization forbidden lines form grows considerably .",
    "the size , location , flux , and time variability of the various forbidden lines will thus change .",
    "ring - like emission structures that form in the dense arcs of primary wind on the apastron side of the system will be less structured and could vanish altogether since the arcs disintegrate sooner after periastron for lower @xmath4 .",
    "a decreased  wind density due to a large drop in @xmath4  may lead to the inability of s wind to trap the ionizing radiation from  at periastron .",
    "this would cause a drastic change in the behavior of the low- and high - ionization forbidden emission lines during periastron passage .",
    "the high - ionization lines would no longer vanish at periastron , while the low - ionization lines would fail to appear .",
    "this behavior could occur in both the extended wind structures of  and the weigelt blobs .",
    "12 . for @xmath327",
    "@xmath318 , fe@xmath315 becomes the dominant ionization state of iron at large radii in s wind , resulting in large amounts of broad , red - shifted [ iii ] emission in most directions over most of the orbital cycle .",
    "a large decrease in @xmath4  could affect periodic dust formation during periastron passage since it would decrease the density in the compressed wwc zone and increase the likelihood of heating and/or destruction by the intense stellar radiation fields .",
    "the wavelength - dependent apparent size of  in the optical and near - ir continuum decreases with @xmath4 .",
    "continuum flux changes that occur when the wwc apex penetrates the surface of high optical depth in s wind photosphere would be affected , making the periodic photometric eclipse - like events shorter due to the smaller continuum size of . for @xmath329  @xmath318",
    ", the eclipse - like events would likely cease .    given",
    "all of the multi - wavelength changes expected , a recent factor of two or more decrease in @xmath4  should be discernable with the right observations",
    ". however , as discussed in the previous section , there are a large number of inconsistencies between what is observed and what numerous models predict should occur if @xmath4  were to drop by a factor of @xmath238 from its historically accepted value of @xmath324  @xmath318 .",
    "one of the most problematic is the lack of any observed changes in the broad wind - emission lines at high stellar latitudes or different spatial locations @xcite .",
    "also puzzling is the fact that the timing of the start of the 2009 spectroscopic event in x - rays , ii @xmath237 , and the ground - based optical photometry was not delayed by any noticeable amount .",
    "it furthermore seems odd that @xmath4  would change with no corresponding change in wind terminal speed .",
    "taken together with the other unobserved but expected changes , it appears that contrary to earlier claims , there has not been a recent significant drop in @xmath4 .",
    "current evidence suggests that any decrease in @xmath4  was likely by a factor @xmath10 and occurred sometime after 2004 , quite possibly during the 2009 event itself .",
    "we speculate that most of the observed recent changes in  are due to a slight ( @xmath330 ) increase in the half - opening angle of the wwc zone , which altered the amount of extinction in los to the central source .",
    "this would explain why the continuum flux and broad wind - emission features in los have changed , while features at high latitudes and in other directions ( e.g. at the weigelt blobs ) remain relatively constant .",
    "it would also explain why the start of the 2009 event at multiple wavelengths did not change .",
    "a modest decrease in @xmath4  by a factor @xmath10 sometime after 2004 could be responsible , and would hardly be surprising given s nature .",
    "however , changes in s wind / stellar parameters , while less likely , can not be fully ruled out at this time . other less likely alternatives to a drop in @xmath4  are discussed in @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the results of sections  [ collapse ] and [ radbraking ] depend on rather complicated shock and radiative - wind - driving physics .",
    "in addition to the known effects of radiative inhibition and braking , there is the rather new phenomenon of so - called self - regulated shocks ( srss ) , in which ionizing x - rays from the wwc shocks inhibit the wind acceleration of one or both stars , leading to lower pre - shock velocities and lower shocked plasma temperatures @xcite .",
    "for most of s orbit , the srs effect is likely to be negligible due to the large binary separation .",
    "however , during periastron passage , srss may further inhibit the acceleration of s wind , helping trigger a cooling - transition phase of s post - shock wind and a possible wwc ` collapse ' .",
    "srss may cause the cooling - transition phase to occur earlier and/or last longer compared to what our simulations predict .",
    "the potential for a wwc collapse onto  in the context of srss is difficult to determine without a detailed time - dependent model since radiative braking ( not included in the analysis of @xcite ) may prevail over the srs effect and prevent a wind - photosphere collision @xcite .",
    "inclusion of srss in future models of  is thus worthwhile and may further elucidate the peculiar behavior of x - rays , ii  @xmath237 , and other lines around periastron .",
    "many recent works suggest that very massive stars experience extreme -like mass ejections of @xmath331  @xmath16  in the year to decade before they explode as type  ii sne @xcite .",
    "the narrow emission lines indicative of type  iin sne are interpreted as signatures of the sn ejecta interacting with this freshly expelled circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "in fact , the most likely detection of a progenitor before its explosion as a type  iin involved an lbv @xcite , thus raising the question of s near - term fate . s numerous massive eruptions point strongly to repeated phases of instability and may be an indication of its imminent demise as a powerful type  iin sn @xcite .",
    "constraining s recent mass - loss history is therefore crucial for determining its possible near- and long - term states .",
    "the 3d simulations and analysis in this paper provide detailed information that is important for helping achieve this goal .",
    "extensive monitoring of s next periastron passage in 2014 will undoubtedly play a pivotal role as well .",

    "we see in the density and temperature slices taken at @xmath111 ( figures  [ figb3 ] and [ figb4 ] , row d ) that this produces a difference in the size of the cavity on the @xmath207 and @xmath113 sides of the system .",
    "the magnitude of this difference increases with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "the larger cavity on the @xmath207 side of the system is the remnant of the wwc cavity from before periastron , while the smaller cavity on the @xmath113 side is part of the new cavity created after periastron .",
    "a temperature difference also exists within the cavity , with the @xmath207 side being much colder than the @xmath113 side in the simulations for cases  a and b. after enough time passes , the new cavity on the @xmath113 side of the system expands to a size comparable to the cavity on the @xmath207 side , although there is still a clear difference in the temperature and density structure of the two cavities ( figures  [ figb3 ] and [ figb4 ] , row e ) .",

    "there is a clear left - right asymmetry in the density and temperature in each panel of the figures .",
    "figure  [ figb5 ] shows that the higher the value of @xmath4 , the smaller the wind cavities carved by  on the @xmath112 side of the system become in the @xmath74 plane .",
    "they are almost not visible in the case  a simulation , with the wind of  in the @xmath112 direction looking continuous , but containing shells of enhanced density at periodic intervals . figure  [ figb5 ] also shows that the gradual fragmentation of the shell of dense  material on the @xmath123 side of the system produces a series of small , cold , dense blobs within the larger , low - density wind cavity created by .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath4 , the larger and denser these blobs are , and the longer they last before mixing with the surrounding  wind .",
    "figure  [ figb6 ] illustrates how in case  a , the winds on the @xmath112 side of the system in the @xmath74 plane remain cold , while the wind cavity on the @xmath123 side remains hot . in cases",
    "b and c , the low - density cavities on both sides of the system remain hot , with only the intermediate regions of dense  wind cold .    in figure  [ figb7 ]",
    "we see that the extended narrow wind cavities on the @xmath207 side of the system in the @xmath75 plane are always smaller than the wind cavities carved on the @xmath113 side .",
    "these smaller cavities are always cold , while the larger cavities are always hot ( figure  [ figb8 ] ) .",
    "the difference in size between these cavities grows with decreasing @xmath4 . in case  a , the cavities are of comparable size , but in case  c , the cavities on the @xmath113 side are much larger .",
