    "numerical studies of qcd provided quite detailed information about the properties of matter at high temperature and vanishing net baryon density @xcite . in particular , the screening of static quark anti - quark sources at large distances and their renormalization has been analyzed in quite some detail @xcite .",
    "compared to this our knowledge on the dependence of the equation of state and screening at non - zero baryon number density , or equivalently , non - zero baryon chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) is rather limited .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the qcd partition function @xcite and the htl - resummation of the pressure @xcite have been evaluated only recently .",
    "although in leading order of high temperature perturbation theory the dependence of the debye screening mass on @xmath0 is well - known @xcite neither the temperature range for the validity of this perturbative result nor the generic features of screening of heavy quark free energies at non - zero @xmath0 have been analyzed so far with non - perturbative methods in the vicinity of the qcd transition .",
    "recently studies of the equation of state have successfully been extended to non - vanishing baryon chemical potential using taylor expansions @xcite around @xmath5 as well as reweighting techniques @xcite and imaginary chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "we will use here the former approach to analyze the screening of static quark anti - quark sources at non - zero @xmath0 , _ i.e. _ in a medium with a non - vanishing net quark density .",
    "we evaluate the taylor expansion coefficients for correlation functions of heavy quark anti - quark pairs and deduce from this expansion coefficients for the screening mass .    for this work we analyzed gauge field configurations using",
    "a p4-improved staggered fermion action with @xmath6 degenerate quark flavours .",
    "we used the same data sample that recently has been generated by the bielefeld - swansea collaboration for the analysis of the equation of state @xcite .",
    "this sample consists of 1000 up to 4000 gauge field configurations available for several bare gauge couplings below and above the transition temperature .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath7 and the bare quark mass , @xmath8 , corresponds to a pion mass of about @xmath9  mev .",
    "in addition we generated 1000 configurations at @xmath10 and 1600 at @xmath11 to check for the approach to the high temperature perturbative regime .",
    "in addition to gauge invariant colour averaged free energies we also have analyzed colour singlet free energies .",
    "to do so all gauge configurations have been transformed to coulomb gauge before evaluating the polyakov loop correlation functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the general setup for calculating taylor expansions for heavy quark free energies .",
    "our numerical results for singlet and colour averaged free energies are presented in section iii . in section",

    "the renormalization constant is independent of @xmath29 .",
    "also close to @xmath4 , where the @xmath29-dependence of the free energies is strongest , the absolute values of the fourth and sixth order expansion coefficients are of the same order as or smaller than the second order expansion coefficient . therefore the 4@xmath2 and 6@xmath2 order contributions rapidly become negligible for @xmath58 .",
    "although the errors are large for the higher order expansion coefficients they show that at high temperature the @xmath59 and @xmath60 order expansion coefficients are opposite in sign , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that at high temperature the asymptotic large distance value of the heavy quark free energy is proportional to the value of the debye mass @xcite . in this limit one",

    "although the statistical significance of our results for @xmath64 rapidly drops with increasing temperature this pattern of alternating signs seems to be valid also at sixth order at least for temperatures @xmath65 .",
    "except for temperatures close to the transition temperature the asymptotic behaviour of the free energies is reached at distances @xmath66 .",
    "we determined their large distance value by taking the weighted average of the values at the five largest distances .",

    "this has been noted before at @xmath52 and suggests that at large distances , e.g. for @xmath70 , the quark anti - quark sources are screened independently from each other ; their relative colour orientation thus becomes irrelevant .    including all terms up to sixth order we calculated the singlet and colour averaged free energies in the range from @xmath71 up to @xmath72 .",
    "results for the colour singlet free energies evaluated at a few values of temperature are shown in fig .",

    "similar results hold for the colour averaged free energies .",
    "the free energies decrease relative to their values at @xmath73 for all temperatures above and below @xmath4 . at small distances",
    "the curves always agree within errors . with increasing distance",
    "a gap opens up which reflects the decrease in free energy at non zero @xmath29 .",
    "as indicated by the asymptotic values @xmath74 , which give the dominant @xmath29-dependent contribution at large distances , the medium effects are largest close to the transition temperature and become smaller with increasing temperature .",

    "we thus can extract the screening masses , m^av,1(t , ) = -_r ( f^av,1_q|q(r , t , ) ) .",
    "[ debye - ansatz ] we use this as our starting point to derive a taylor expansion for the screening masses . expanding the logarithm in eq .",

    "they are thus suitable for a determination of the @xmath29-dependent corrections to the screening masses .",
    "this is not the case for the leading order , @xmath29-independent , contribution . in order to determine @xmath79 we use an ansatz for the large distance behaviour of the singlet free energy motivated by leading order high temperature perturbation theory , f^1_q|q , 0(r , t ) = f^1_q|q,0 ( , t ) - e^-m^1_0(t ) r. we fit our data to this equation using @xmath80 and @xmath79 as fit parameters where @xmath81 is determined as described in the previous section .",
    "we choose the same fitting procedure as in @xcite namely averaging results received from five fit windows with left borders between @xmath82 and @xmath83 and right border at @xmath84 .",
    "while the above ansatz is known to describe rather well the large distance behaviour of the color singlet free energy , it also is known that the sub - leading power - like corrections are much more difficult to control in the case of the colour averaged free energy . for this reason we will analyze here only the leading order contribution to the singlet screening mass .    results for effective masses in the singlet channel",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ df2df0 ] as function of @xmath85 for one value of the temperature . as can be seen the asymptotic value",
    "is indeed reached quickly before the errors grow large at distances @xmath86 .",

    "[ mass2 ] .",
    "this figure shows that at high temperatures the @xmath29-dependent corrections to the screening mass of the colour averaged free energies @xmath93 are twice as large as those of the ( debye ) screening mass in the singlet channel , @xmath94 .",
    "this is expected from perturbation theory , which suggests that the leading order contribution to the colour singlet free energy is given by one gluon exchange while the colour averaged free energy is dominated by two gluon exchange . using resummed gluon propagators",
    "then leads to screening masses that differ by a factor of 2 , m^1_n(t ) = m^av_n(t ) , n = 2 , 4 , 6 , [ half ] our results suggest that this relation holds already close to @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ mass2 ] ) .",
    "we thus have no evidence for large contributions from the magnetic sector , which is expected to dominate the screening in the colour averaged channel at asymptotically large temperatures @xcite and which would violate the simple relation given in eq .

    "we need to specify the running coupling @xmath95 .",
    "following @xcite we use the next - to - leading order perturbative result for the running of the coupling with temperature but allow for a free overall scale factor .",
    "we thus fit our data on the @xmath47-dependence of the leading order ( @xmath53 ) screening mass by the ansatz , m^1_0(t ) = a g(t)t , [ am0 ] with the 2nd order perturbative running coupling , g(t)^2 = ^-1 , where we use @xmath96 and the scale @xmath97 as in  @xcite . fitting our data to eq .",

    "[ mass2 ] .",
    "we also compare the temperature dependence of @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 with corresponding expansion coefficients of the perturbative debye mass which result from an expansion of ( [ pert ] ) using ( [ am0 ] ) as the 0th order .",

    "we have analyzed the response of colour singlet and colour averaged heavy quark free energies to a non - vanishing baryon chemical potential and have calculated the resulting dependence of screening masses on the chemical potential . using a taylor expansion in @xmath37 we get stable results for the leading , non - vanishing correction , @xmath99 , which is @xmath109 .",
    "we find that this correction in absolute units as well as its ratio with the leading order screening mass , @xmath79 , is large in the vicinity of the transition temperature .",
    "the ratio @xmath110 is in agreement with perturbation theory for @xmath111 indicating that the expansion coefficients @xmath104 receive the same multiplicative rescaling as the leading order screening mass .",
    "a calculation of the @xmath29-dependent corrections to the screening mass in the colour averaged channel shows that these corrections are twice as large as those in the color singlet channel for all temperatures @xmath112 .",
    "this agreement with leading order perturbation theory indeed is quite remarkable as it suggests that the leading contribution to the @xmath29-dependent corrections of the colour averaged screening mass is due to two - gluon exchange .",
    "the higher order expansion coefficients of the screening mass vanish within statistical errors at temperatures larger than @xmath113 .",
    "the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the free energies themselves , however , suggests that these corrections are non - zero but small at high temperature and have alternating signs .",
    "this is consistent with the leading order perturbative result for the debye mass subsequent expansion coefficients of which drop by more than an order of magnitude and alternate in sign as they arise from an expansion of a square root .",
    "our results thus suggest that at least for small values of the chemical potential and fixed temperature the screening length in a baryon rich quark gluon plasma decreases with increasing value of the chemical potential .",

    "<S> we analyze the dependence of heavy quark free energies on the baryon chemical potential @xmath0 in 2-flavour qcd using improved ( p4 ) staggered fermions with a bare quark mass of @xmath1 . by performing a 6@xmath2 order taylor expansion in the chemical potential which circumvents the sign problem . </S>",
    "<S> the taylor expansion coefficients of colour singlet and colour averaged free energies are calculated and from this the expansion coefficients for the corresponding screening masses are determined . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for small @xmath0 the free energies of a static quark anti - quark pair decrease in a medium with a net excess of quarks and that screening is well described by a screening mass which increases with increasing @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-dependent corrections to the screening masses are well described by perturbation theory for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find for all temperatures above @xmath4 that the expansion coefficients for singlet and colour averaged screening masses differ by a factor 2 . </S>"
