    "the high - statistics neutrino observation from the next nearby supernova ( sn ) will provide a bonanza of information about the astrophysics of core - collapse phenomena and neutrino properties . in a recent physical review letter",
    "a strong case was made for the importance of coincidence measurements between gravitational wave and neutrino signals from sn core bounce  @xcite .",
    "the largest existing sn neutrino detectors are super - kamiokande and icecube , reaching to a distance of about 100  kpc .",
    "the expected distribution of galactic sne drops off quickly beyond about 20  kpc @xcite . at this `` pessimistic '' distance , super - kamiokande",
    "can time the bounce to within a few tens of milliseconds , an interval comparable to the expected duration of the gravitational wave burst  @xcite .",
    "we here extend this study to icecube , a high - statistics sn neutrino detector that would have seen the sn  1987a neutrino signal with @xmath1 significance .",
    "for galactic sne , the large rate of uncorrelated cherenkov photons provides excellent time - structure information .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we note that neutrino masses are small enough to neglect time - of - flight effects . recalling that the diameter of the earth is 42  ms , millisecond - coincidence measurements between detectors at different geographic locations requires determining the sn direction either by astronomical observations or by the electron - scattering signal in super - kamiokande .",
    "when sn neutrinos stream through water or ice , cherenkov light is generated , primarily by the secondary positrons from inverse beta decay @xmath2 . while fine - grained detectors reconstruct individual neutrinos on an event - by - event basis , icecube only picks up the average cherenkov glow of the ice . to estimate the detection rate we follow ref .",
    "@xcite , augmented with the latest icecube efficiencies  @xcite .",
    "the complete detector will have 4800 optical modules ( oms ) and the data are read out in 1.6384  ms bins , implying a total event rate  of @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the peak luminosity reaches @xmath75 and at that time @xmath8  mev . for a thermal or slightly pinched spectrum , @xmath9",
    "altogether , we expect @xmath10 as a typical peak event rate for a sn at 10  kpc .",
    "this signal is to be compared with a background of 280  s@xmath11 in each om  @xcite , corresponding for 4800  oms to @xmath12 with an rms fluctuation of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the sn - induced `` correlated noise '' in the entire detector is highly significant  @xcite . from any one neutrino interacting in the ice , at most one cherenkov photon",
    "is picked up : the signal counts are entirely uncorrelated .",
    "the prompt @xmath14 burst immediately after bounce produces a peak rate of about @xmath15 , lasting for several ms .",
    "its impact on the early count rate depends sensitively on the flavor oscillation scenario ( see below ) .",
    "sn models suggest that neutrino emission for the first 20  ms after core bounce depends little on model assumptions or input physics  @xcite , although beyond this early phase the accretion rate and therefore neutrino emission depends strongly , for example , on the progenitor mass profile .",
    "the prompt @xmath14 burst reaches its peak at 57  ms post bounce , which also marks the onset of @xmath16 emission that is initially suppressed by the large @xmath14 chemical potential .",
    "up to about 20  ms post bounce @xmath17 rises roughly linearly .",
    "we thus represent the early icecube signal as  @xcite @xmath18 with @xmath19  ms , @xmath20  ms and @xmath21 .",
    "these parameters also provide an excellent fit to the first 100  ms of a numerical model from the garching group  @xcite that is available to us .",
    "we may compare these assumptions with the early - phase models of ref .",
    "@xmath17 rises nearly linearly to @xmath222 within 10  ms .",
    "the evolution of @xmath23 is also shown , a common quantity in sn physics that characterizes , for example , the efficiency of energy deposition ; the icecube rate is proportional to @xmath24 . at 10  ms after onset , @xmath25 reaches 15  mev , implying @xmath26 .",
    "we thus estimate 10  ms after onset a rate of 280@xmath27 , to be compared with @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : risemodel ] ) . therefore , our assumed signal rise is on the conservative side .",
    "of course , the early models do not fix @xmath29 and @xmath30 separately ; the crucial parameters are @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the maximum rate that is reached long after bounce is not relevant for determining the onset of the signal .",
    "if flavor oscillations swap the @xmath16 flux with @xmath33 ( some combination of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , the rise begins earlier because the large @xmath14 chemical potential during the prompt @xmath14 burst does not suppress the early emission of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the rise time is faster , @xmath36 larger , and the maximum luminosity smaller .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : risemodel ] ) also for @xmath37 with @xmath38 , @xmath39  ms , and @xmath40 .",
    "flavor oscillations are unavoidable and have been studied , for early neutrino emission , in ref .",
    "@xcite . assuming the normal mass hierarchy , @xmath41 , no collective oscillations , and a direct observation without earth effects , table  i of ref .",
    "@xcite reveals that the @xmath14 burst would be completely swapped and thus nearly invisible because the @xmath42 elastic scattering cross section is much smaller than that of @xmath14 .",
    "the survival probability of @xmath16 would be @xmath43 with @xmath44 the `` solar '' mixing angle . therefore",
    ", the effective detection rate would be @xmath45 .",
    "we use this case as our main example .",
    "a typical monte carlo realization of the icecube signal for our example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] . one can determine the signal onset @xmath46 within a few ms by naked eye .",
    "for a sn closer than our standard distance of 10  kpc , one can follow details of the neutrino light curve without any fit .    ]",
    "one can not separate the @xmath16 and @xmath33 components for the example of fig .  [",
    "fig : simulation ] .",
    "therefore , we reconstruct a fit with a single component of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : risemodel ] ) , assuming the zero - signal background is well known and not fitted here . using a time interval until 100  ms post bounce ,",
    "we reconstruct @xmath47  ms ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "if we use only data until 33  ms post bounce we find @xmath49  ms . indeed , if one fits eq .",
    "( [ eq : risemodel ] ) on an interval that ends long before the plateau is reached , we effectively fit a second order polynomial with a positive slope and negative second derivative at  @xmath31 , whereas the plateau itself is poorly fitted and its assumed value plays little role . depending on the distance of the sn one will fit more or fewer details of the overall neutrino light curve and there may be more efficient estimators for @xmath31 .",
    "our example only provides a rough impression of what icecube can do .",
    "the reconstruction uncertainty of @xmath46 scales approximately with neutrino flux , i.e. , with sn distance squared .",
    "the number of excess events above background marking the onset of the signal has to be compared with the background fluctuations .",
    "therefore , a significant number of excess events above background requires a longer integration period if the flux is smaller , explaining this scaling behavior .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath46 relative to the true bounce time depends on the flavor oscillation scenario realized in nature .",
    "this is influenced by many factors : the value of @xmath50 , the mass ordering , the role of collective oscillation effects , and the distance traveled in the earth .",
    "combining the signal from different detectors , using future laboratory information on neutrino parameters , and perhaps the very coincidence with a gravitational - wave signal may allow one to disentangle some of these features .",
    "however , as a first rough estimate it is sufficient to say that the reconstructed @xmath46 tends to be systematically delayed relative to the bounce time by no more than a few ms .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the @xmath46 reconstruction does not depend strongly on the oscillation scenario .",
    "the authors of ref .  @xcite used a sn emission model based on a two - component fit of the sparse sn  1987a data and described the overall neutrino signal in terms of several parameters which they say , after eq .",
    "( 5 ) , are at odds with theoretical expectations . however ,",
    "their parameter @xmath51  mev , describing the temperature of the neutrino - emitting gas during the accretion phase , gives @xmath52  mev ( see paragraph after eq .  15 in the published version of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and thus is virtually identical to the corresponding @xmath25 from ref .",
    "@xcite at 20  ms post bounce .",
    "in other words , while the sn  1987a implied @xmath16 energies of ref .",
    "@xcite are lower than theoretical expectations for the overall accretion phase , in the absence of flavor oscillations they agree nicely with the models of ref .",
    "@xcite for the crucial first 20  ms . however , the chosen rise time @xmath53  ms is very long compared with the early - time models of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the early neutrino signal after bounce was systematically studied for different input assumptions ( progenitor mass , equation of state , neutrino opacities ) , leading to very similar results . on the other hand",
    ", one finds significantly different numerical examples in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath16 luminosity rises to @xmath54 after as much as 50  ms . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a peak value of only @xmath55 is reached and the rise within 1020  ms after bounce is small . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath16 signal begins rising as late as 12  ms after the maximum of the @xmath14 burst .",
    "there are many differences between these and other models in terms of numerical approach and input physics .",
    "it would be extremely useful if another group would investigate the early neutrino signal in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite for a range of physical assumptions and with attention to numerical details that may influence the early - time behavior .    in view of the large range of possible distances to the next nearby sn and concomitant flux differences",
    ", these uncertainties do not change our overall conclusions . in our fiducial example",
    "icecube can reconstruct the signal onset within @xmath567  ms at @xmath48 cl for a sn at 20  kpc , comparable to what ref .",
    "@xcite found for super - kamiokande .",
    "ideally , of course , one would combine the measurements from several detectors .",
    "a gravitational wave measurement of the core bounce in coincidence with neutrino onset would be of obvious astrophysical importance .",
    "in addition one could test the weak equivalence principle .",
    "both neutrinos and gravitational waves should suffer the same shapiro time delay in the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "for sn  1987a in the large magellanic cloud , this delay was a few months .",
    "the coincidence of the neutrino burst with the rise of the light curve within a few hours proved an equal shapiro delay for photons and neutrinos to within about @xmath57 @xcite . a millisecond - scale coincidence between neutrinos and gravitational waves would extend and refine this test , in detail depending on the location of the sn .    if the sn can not be located by astronomical means because of obscuration",
    ", the electron - recoil signal in super - kamiokande or a future megatonne water cherenkov detector is the method of choice  @xcite , whereas arrival - time triangulation was dismissed . with icecube almost complete , the situation has changed and triangulation can play a useful role after all , at least for a not - too - distant sn .",
    "moreover , in europe a big detector of the laguna - class @xcite may become available ( representing one of three possible large - scale detector types ) and a megatonne water - cherenkov detector may be built in north america .",
    "arrival - time triangulation between large - scale neutrino detectors on different continents could become viable .",
    "it would be a worthwhile exercise to study the possibilities of bounce timing , based on common astrophysical assumptions , for different detector types and what can be learnt from a combined analysis . to this end",
    "it would be worthwhile if groups other than the garching one would systematically study the numerical early - time neutrino signal to judge if indeed the dependence on physical assumptions is as small as found in ref .",
