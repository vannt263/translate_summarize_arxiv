    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been proposed as a potential origin of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) ( e.g. , waxman 1995 ; vietri 1995 ; milgrom and usov 1995 ) .",
    "high - energy neutrinos are thought to be a useful messenger to probe cr acceleration in grbs , as they are predicted to be produced in the dissipative fireballs , where cosmic - ray protons interact with fireball gamma - ray photons through photopion process ( e.g. , waxman & bahcall 1997 ; guetta et al . 2004 ; dermer & atoyan 2006 ; murase et al . 2006 ;",
    "wang & dai 2009 ) .",
    "however , search for high - energy neutrinos in coincident with grbs using icecube has failed to find any associated neutrinos so far ( abbasi et al .",
    "2012 ; aartsen et al . 2015 ) .",
    "the non - detection has put stringent constraints on the neutrino production efficiency and fireball properties of grbs ( he et al .",
    "2012 ; zhang & kumar 2013 ; gao et al . 2013 ; yacobi et al .",
    "2014 ) . because the low neutrino flux could be simply due to a low efficiency in converting crs to neutrinos , as expected in some grb models with large dissipation radius",
    ", one can not rule out cr acceleration in grbs with the non - detection of neutrinos .",
    "crs accelerated by grbs will finally escape from the source and enter the interstellar space of the host galaxy .",
    "the proton - proton collisions between crs and nuclei in the interstellar medium will also produce high - energy neutrinos . recently , icecube collaboration reported the detection of extraterrestrial tev - pev neutrinos with a best - fit flux of @xmath3 per flavor ( aartsen et al .",
    "2014 ) . noting the coincidence between the icecube neutrino flux and the waxman - bahcall bound ( @xmath4 ) derived from the flux of uhecrs above @xmath5",
    ", some authors suggest that icecube neutrinos may be produced by the same source responsible these uhecrs ( waxman 2013 ; katz et al .",
    "as grbs are one candidate source of uhecrs , one may wonder whether neutrinos resulted from the cr collisions with the ism in the host galaxy can explain the icecube observations ( waxman 2013 , wang et al .",
    "2014 ) . in this paper",
    ", we study this interesting possibility by perform a calculation of the expected neutrino flux with the knowledge about the properties of grbs and their host galaxies .    one key unknown factor that decides the neutrino flux from grb host galaxies is the pion production efficiency , i.e. the energy loss of cr protons into pions due to collisions with the ism of the host galaxy .",
    "crs interact with the ism along their path before escape , so this efficiency relates with the gas column density that crs traversed . as crs",
    "are transported outward by galactic winds , the gas surface density @xmath6 represents an averaged column density of matter that crs traversed .",
    "however , for most grbs , we do not have measurements of @xmath6 at the grb explosion site as grb hosts are hardly spatially resolved .",
    "we note that the x - ray absorption column density @xmath0 , inferred from the x - ray observations of the prompt and afterglow emission , has a similar role , but @xmath0 reflects the column density along the direction of the line of sight ( rather than the averaged gas column density ) .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath0 is derived assuming solar metallicity for the absorbing gas , while grbs seem to occur preferentially in low metallicity galaxies ( stanek et al . 2006 ; prieto et al . 2008 ) . the x - ray absorption , as measured with swift / xrt observations , mainly takes place through inner shell electrons of metals , thus it is linked to the metallicity of the ism in the host galaxies .",
    "if grb host galaxies have lower metallicity , the true absorbing gas column density should be higher than the quoted values obtained from fitting x - ray afterglows , considering this metallicity difference .",
    "we thus first study how well @xmath0 can trace the gas surface density @xmath6 in  2 .",
    "we find that @xmath0 is well correlated with the surface star - formation rate ( @xmath7 ) of the host galaxies .",
    "then taking into account the kennicutt - schmidt law that relates the surface gas density and the surface star - formation rate ( kennicutt 1998 ) , we obtain a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "once @xmath6 is known for each grb , we can calculate the neutrino production efficiency and further calculate the accumulated neutrino flux from all grb host galaxies (  3 ) .",
    "because we have very few measurements of @xmath8 , but have measurement of @xmath0 for many grbs , we study whether @xmath0 are correlated with @xmath8 and act as an indicator of the gas surface density .",
    "we collect the grb hosts that have spatially resolved observations from literatures ( svensson et al .",
    "2010 ; fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ; savaglio et al . 2009 ) , which are given in table 1 .",
    "the total sfr and @xmath9 light radius of these hosts @xmath10 are obtained in these observations . by comparing the @xmath9 light radius and half light radius of some grb hosts that are spatially resolved ( fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ; kelly et al .",
    "2014 ) , we find that @xmath11 . converting @xmath9 light radius to the half - light radius @xmath12 with @xmath13 , we calculate the surface star - formation rates @xmath8 . with a sample of 18 grbs that have both measurements of @xmath0 from the xrt data of swift observations and @xmath8 of their host galaxies , we then study the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath14 . through the ordinary least - squares ( ols )",
    "bisector fitting and @xmath14 , and it is not clear which variable is causative .",
    "therefore , the ols bisector fitting which treat the variables symmetrically should be used , according to isobe et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . ]",
    "( isobe et al . 1990 ) , we find that @xmath15 with a correlation coefficient of @xmath16 and a null hypothesis probability of @xmath17 , indicating a good correlation .",
    "the result of the fit is shown in the left panel of fig.1 . considering the kennicutt - schmidt law between the surface sfr and the surface density of molecular plus atomic gas ( kennicutt 1998 ) , i.e. , @xmath18 we get @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the roughly linear relation between @xmath21 and @xmath0 suggests that @xmath0 is a good indicator of the gas surface density @xmath6 .",
    "note that @xmath0 is derived assuming solar metallicity for the absorbing gas .",
    "since grb host galaxies usually have lower metallicity , the true absorbing gas column density should be corrected by the metallicity effect .",
    "the coefficient @xmath22 may reflect such a correction .",
    "we also study whether @xmath0 are correlated with the total sfrs of the host galaxies .",
    "we collect 35 grbs in total that have measurements of @xmath0 and total sfrs , which are also listed in table 1 . through the ols bisector",
    "fitting of the data of @xmath0 and sfr , we find that @xmath23 with a correlation coefficient of @xmath24 and a null hypothesis probability @xmath25 , which indicates a tight positive correlation .",
    "the result of the fitting is shown in the right panel of fig.1 . with this relation",
    ", we can infer the sfr of grb hosts with @xmath0 for each grb in our sample , which will be used to compute the galactic wind velocity in  3.1 .",
    "the grb accelerated cr protons travel through the host galaxy and produce high - energy neutrinos via proton  proton(_pp_)-collisions with its interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the collisions produce charged pions , which decay to neutrinos ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "meanwhile , crs can escape out of the galaxy through diffusion or galactic wind advection .",
    "these two competing processes ( i.e. collision and escape ) regulate the efficiency of the pion - production of crs , which can be described by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the energy - loss time of crs via ( @xmath29 ) collisions and @xmath30 is the escape time of crs .",
    "pp_-collision energy loss time is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the inelasticity , @xmath33 is the gas number density , @xmath34 is the scale height of the gaseous disc of the galaxy .",
    "@xmath35 is the _ pp_-collision inelastic cross - section , which slightly increases with the proton energy , given by @xmath36 ^ 2{\\rm mb}$ ] where @xmath37 ( kelner et al .",
    "thus , the collision energy loss time is @xmath38 .    the crs escape from the grb host galaxy in two ways .",
    "one is advective transportation by the galactic wind .",
    "galactic - scale gaseous winds are ubiquitous in star - forming galaxies at all cosmic epochs ( heckman et al . 1990 ; pettini et al .",
    "2001 ; shapley et al .",
    "such winds can be driven by stellar winds , supernova explosions or other processes .",
    "it is found that , for luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies at low redshifts , the winds from more luminous starbursts have higher speeds , roughly as @xmath39 sfr@xmath40 with @xmath41 being in the range of 0.25 - 0.35 ( martin 2005 ; rupke et al . 2005 ;",
    "arribas et al . 2014 ) .",
    "a similar trend is found for star - forming galaxies at @xmath42 ( weiner et al .",
    "2009 ) , i.e. @xmath43 with the error in @xmath44 being @xmath45 .",
    "such type of relation between the velocity of the outflowing material and sfr is expected if the mechanical energy is supplied by stellar winds and supernova explosions .",
    "thus , one can calculate @xmath44 for each grb hosts with measured @xmath0 under the help of eq . 4 and eq . 5 .",
    "taking @xmath46 as the reference value for grb host galaxies , the advective escape time is @xmath47 .    the other way that crs escape is diffusion , i.e. , crs are scattered off small - scale magnetic field inhomogeneities randomly and diffuse out of the host galaxy . the diffusion time is estimated to be @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are normalization factors .",
    "since little is known about the diffusion coefficient in grb host galaxies , in the calculation we allow lower diffusion coefficients than that of our galaxy , which is @xmath52 .",
    "the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient is also unknown and @xmath53 depending on the spectrum of interstellar magnetic turbulence .",
    "we assume two cases , one is the commonly - used value @xmath54 , based on the measurement of the cr confinement time in our galaxy ( engelmann et al .",
    "1990 ; webber et al . 2003 ) .",
    "another choice is @xmath55 , assuming the kolmogorov - type turbulence .",
    "then the diffusive escape time is @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .    combining the advective and diffusive escape timescales , the total escape time is @xmath58 when the difference between @xmath59 and @xmath60 is large , @xmath61 .",
    "note that when @xmath62 , which holds for low - energy crs and small values of @xmath50 , the pion production efficiency is independent of @xmath34 and is given by @xmath63 the dependence of @xmath64 on cr energy has a break at the energy where @xmath65 .",
    "below the break energy , @xmath66 slightly increases with the energy due to the _ pp_-collision inelastic cross - section , while above the break @xmath66 decreases as @xmath67 , leading to a steeper neutrino spectrum .",
    "the fermi / gbm detection rate of grbs is about 250 per year ( paciesas et al . 2012 ) , and the total gamma - ray ( 10 - 1000 kev ) fluence of grbs detected in one year is @xmath68 .",
    "the gbm field of view ( fov ) is roughly @xmath69 steradians , so the total all - sky flux of gamma - rays in 10 - 1000 kev is @xmath70 . then the energy production rate of gamma - rays in the energy range of 10 - 1000 kev , is estimated to be @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the hubble constant and @xmath73 is a factor accounting for the source density evolution with redshift ( eichler et al .",
    "according to the estimate of katz et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the present - day _ differential _ energy production rate of uhecrs above 30 eev is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the power - law index of the cr spectrum .",
    "we assume @xmath76 as suggested by fermi acceleration .",
    "define @xmath77 as the ratio between the _ differential _ energy production rate of uhecrs and the energy production rate of gamma - rays in 10 - 1000 kev . if grbs are the source of uhecrs above 30 eev , @xmath78 , assuming @xmath79 ( eichler et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "we collect a sample of grbs that have both measurements of @xmath80 and gamma - ray fluence . as the energy coverage of swift bat is small ,",
    "we choose grbs that are detected by fermi / gbm to get more accurate values of the gamma - ray fluence .",
    "there are 45 grbs in total that have measurements of both @xmath0 and gamma - ray fluence , as shown in table 2 . for each grb ,",
    "the ( single - flavor ) neutrino fluence is estimated to be @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the differential energy flux of cr protons and @xmath83 is the gamma - ray fluence of this grb .",
    "the accumulated neutrino flux produced by all grbs in the universe is @xmath84 where @xmath85 represents the @xmath85th grb in our sample , @xmath86 is the total number of grbs in our sample , and @xmath87 is the all - sky rate of grbs that would be detected by fermi / gbm if the field of view of gbm is @xmath88 steradians .",
    "the result of the accumulated neutrino flux is shown in fig.2 .",
    "we find that the accumulated neutrino flux at pev is @xmath89 per flavor for @xmath55 and @xmath90 .",
    "the 1 sigma error in the accumulated flux is obtained by using formulas for the propagation of error .",
    "it results mainly from the uncertainties in the neutrino production efficiency @xmath64 , in the values of @xmath0 , and in the cr - to - gamma - ray ratio @xmath77 .    since the cr diffusion coefficient is not well - understood , we study its effect on the neutrino flux .",
    "the results for different values of @xmath91 and @xmath50 are shown in fig .",
    "3 . one can see that , when @xmath50 decreases , the neutrino flux increases at pev energies . for @xmath55 ,",
    "if @xmath50 is as low as @xmath92 , the neutrino spectrum becomes too hard , although the flux increases . for @xmath54 , lower values of @xmath50",
    "is needed to produce the same flux compared to the case of @xmath55 . however , the confinement of 100 pev crs producing pev neutrinos requires that @xmath50 be larger than @xmath93 ( murase et al .",
    "thus , even under favorable conditions about the cr diffusion coefficient , the neutrino flux produced by grb crs alone can not explain the icecube observations if other assumptions used in our calculation are correct .    in the calculation of the accumulated neutrino flux , we only considered those grbs that triggered fermi / gbm detector ( i.e. adopting @xmath94 ) .",
    "there are dim grbs that do not trigger the detector and their total gamma - ray fluence may even be larger than that of the triggered ones according to the simulation results in liu & wang ( 2013 ) .",
    "these untriggered grbs may also produce diffuse neutrinos as triggered grbs .",
    "however , one should note that considering the contribution by untriggered grbs would not change our result about the accumulated neutrino flux , because the the cr - to - gamma - ray ratio @xmath77 needs to be re - calibrated correspondingly and thus the accumulated neutrino flux remains unchanged",
    ".    there could be an exceptional case , i.e. , if some dim grbs do not accelerate protons to energy @xmath95 ev ( although nuclei can still be accelerated to ultra high energies ) , but they can still contribute to pev neutrinos with crs of @xmath96 .",
    "note also that this does not exclude the possibility that low - luminosity grbs themselves are responsible for their origin ( e.g. , murase & ioka 2013 , bhattacharya et al .",
    "the above calculation has some uncertainties in the following aspects .",
    "first , the estimate of the energy production rate of gamma - rays @xmath97 has uncertainty ( e.g. , dermer 2012 ) .",
    "note that the factor @xmath79 is obtained by assuming that grb rate follows the cosmic sfr of porciani & madau ( 2001 ) or that of hopkins & beacom ( 2008 ) .",
    "if grb density evolves faster than the cosmic sfr , @xmath73 is smaller and then @xmath77 is larger .",
    "second , the estimate of the uhecr energy budget has uncertainty . the value can be a bit larger if one uses the telescope array or hires data .",
    "third , the power - law index @xmath75 could be softer than 2 , then the energy budget of crs at 100 pev could be larger .",
    "thus , given these uncertainties , the neutrino flux in the optimistic case could reach the observed value of icecube .",
    "on the other hand , if one consider that grb host galaxies that are not detected by optical observations are possibly smaller galaxies , such as dwarf galaxies , the pion production efficiency may be smaller and thus the neutrino flux contributed by these galaxies would be smaller .",
    "also , as shown by eq .",
    "6 , the pion production efficiency depends on the speeds of the galactic winds .",
    "the properties of the galactic winds in grb host galaxies are not well - explored .",
    "x - ray observations of starburst galactic winds , such as m82 , usually give a higher speeds than that inferred from the optical observations ( strickland & heckman 2009 ) .",
    "if the galactic wind speeds of grb hosts are proven to be higher , the neutrino flux produced by grb hosts would decrease .",
    "the pion production efficiency also depends on the diffusive coefficient .",
    "if @xmath98 is larger than @xmath99 ( for example , @xmath100 for our galaxy ) , the accumulated neutrino flex would be lower than @xmath101 at @xmath102 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 .    in summary , we calculated the neutrino flux produced by crs accelerated by grbs while they are propagating in the host galaxies based on our current knowledge about grb and their host galaxies .",
    "these crs collide with nuclei of ism and produce neutrinos before they escape out of the galaxy . when the flux of crs produced by grbs is normalized with the observed flux of uhecrs above @xmath1 , the accumulated neutrino flux is @xmath103 per flavor under the usual assumptions about the grb properties and favorable assumptions about the cr diffusion coefficient .",
    "the estimate , however , has uncertainty due to uncertainty in our current knowledge of grb and their host galaxies and the accumulated neutrino flux could reach the observed value by icecube in the optimistic case , so we can not rule out this scenario at present .",
