    "topological phase of condensed matter systems is a quantum many - body state with nontrivial momentum or real space topology in the hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "recent newly discovered topological superconductor ( tsc ) has spawned considerable interests since this kind of topological phase supports the emergence of majorana fermion ( mf ) @xcite which is a promising candidate for the fault - tolerant topological quantum computation ( tqc ) @xcite .",
    "there are several proposals for hosting mfs in tsc , for example , chiral @xmath1-wave superconductor @xcite , cu - doped topological insulator @xmath2 @xcite , superconducting proximity devices @xcite and noncentrosymmetric superconductor ( ncs ) @xcite .",
    "the signatures of mfs have also been reported in the superconducting insb nanowire @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite and topological insulator josephson junction @xcite . to obtain a readily manipulated majorana platform for tqc ,",
    "more experimental confirmations and theoretical proposals are therefore highly desirable .    in this paper , we study the topological phase and majorana fermion at the edge and in the vortex core of the @xmath0-wave dresselhaus ( 110 ) spin - orbit ( so ) coupled ncs .",
    "it is found that the asymmetric so interaction plays a crucial role in realizing topological phases in the ncs .",
    "although the rashba so coupled ncs has been previously investigated @xcite , the dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupled ncs is relatively less discussed theoretically @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that there is a novel semimetal phase in the dresselhaus ncs , where the energy gap closes in the whole region and different kinds of flat andreev bound states ( abss ) emerge .",
    "we demonstrate that these flat abss support the emergence of mfs analytically and numerically .",
    "it is known that the chern number is not a well - defined topological invariant in the gapless region , however , we find that the topologically different semimetal phases in this gapless region can still be distinguished by the pfaffian invariant of the particle - hole symmetric hamiltonian .",
    "several authors have proposed the flat abss in the ncs @xmath4 with high order so couplings @xcite , @xmath5-wave superconductor , @xmath6-wave superconductor and @xmath7-wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "instead , our proposal for hosting the flat abss is an @xmath0-wave dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupled ncs in an in - plane magnetic field which is more flexible than the previous proposals where one needs to apply a magnetic field in the @xmath8 direction to the materials @xcite .",
    "our proposal is experimentally more feasible .",
    "the flat dispersion implies a peak in the density of states ( dos ) which is clearly visible and has an experimental signature in the tunneling conductance measurements @xcite .",
    "the zero - bias conductance peak has been observed in recent experiments on the insb nanowire @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite and argued to be due to the flat abs .",
    "thus if the majorana fermion exists in the dresselhaus ncs , the flat abs and the zero - bias conductance peak in the dos predicted here should be detectable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "@xmath17 is the zeeman field induced by the in - plane magnetic field with components @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupling and @xmath20 is the @xmath0-wave superconducting term with gap function @xmath21 .",
    "we assume @xmath22 throughout this paper . in the momentum space ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath23 with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the wave vector in the first brillouin zone and the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian is @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the pauli matrices operating on the particle - hole space and spin space , respectively .",
    "the nontrivial topological order in the dresselhaus ncs is characterized by the existence of gapless edge state and majorana fermion .",
    "below we shall demonstrate these features in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "for comparison , we first briefly summarize the known results of the @xmath0-wave rashba ncs , in which the dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupling @xmath19 in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is replaced by the rashba so coupling @xmath31 $ ] and the in - plane magnetic field is replaced by a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite . as usual , we can use the chern number to characterize the nontrivial momentum space topology of the rashba ncs .",
    "the chern number defined for the fully gapped hamiltonian is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the strength of the gauge field @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "the integral is carried out in the first brillouin zone and the summation is carried out for the occupied states .",
    "as long as the topological quantum transition does not happen , the chern number remains unchanged .",
    "since the topological quantum transition happens when the energy gap closes , the phase boundary can be depicted by studying the gap - closing condition of the hamiltonian . in the phase diagram of the rashba ncs as shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig1]a ) , we find that the gap closes in some lines and the chern number is attached to each region of the phase diagram",
    ".    however , in the present case , we shall show that the phase diagram of the dresselhaus ncs has a gapless region that makes the chern number ill - defined . to see this , we diagonalize the bdg hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) in the periodic boundary conditions of the @xmath36 and @xmath8 directions , then the energy spectrum is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "after some straightforward calculations , we find that when @xmath43 , @xmath44 ; when @xmath45 , @xmath46 . finally , the gap closes at @xmath47 or @xmath48 subjected to @xmath49 .",

    "the number of gap - closing points at @xmath43 , @xmath50 and @xmath45 , @xmath51 are also shown as a pair @xmath52 .",
    "later we shall derive a relation between the number of gap - closing points in the first brillouin zone and the topological invariant of the hamiltonian .",
    "interestingly , different from the phase diagram of the rashba ncs in the fig .",
    "( [ fig1]a ) , where the gap closes in some boundary lines and each gapped region between them has a distinct chern number , the phase diagram of the dresselhaus ncs has a gapless area from a to g as shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig1]b ) , which means that the system is in the semimetal phase in the whole region . inside the gapless region",
    ", it is well known that the chern number is not well - defined .",
    "however , several other topological invariants which are obtained from symmetry analysis of the hamiltonian can still be used to characterize the topologically different semimetal phases in the gapless region . for the hamiltonian eq .",

    "it is easy to check that @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the phase diagram of the dresselhaus ncs as shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig1]b ) .",

    "( [ wky ] ) , the range where the flat abss exist in the edge brillouin zone can be exactly obtained as shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig2]c ) and ( [ fig2]d ) .",
    "the number of flat abss is half of the number of gap - closing points in the first brillouin zone . from the hamiltonian in the chiral basis",
    ", we can see that the gap closes when @xmath79 . in the complex plane of @xmath80 ,",
    "a winding number can be assigned to each gap - closing point @xmath81 as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a contour enclosing the gap - closing point . due to the particle - hole symmetry , we find that @xmath84 , therefore , the gap - closing points with opposite winding number are equal in number .",
    "the function @xmath85 in the region a and e are shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig2]e ) and ( [ fig2]f ) .",
    "as long as the projection of opposite winding number gap - closing points does not completely overlap in the edge brillouin zone , there will be flat abss connecting them @xcite .",
    "therefore , the number of flat abss is @xmath86 and it is easy to check that @xmath70 is the parity of @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding dos of these two different semimetal phases are shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig2]g ) and ( [ fig2]h ) .",
    "we find that there is a peak at zero energy which is clearly visible in the tunneling conductance measurements .",
    "therefore , all of these flat abss have clear experimental signature in the tunneling conductance measurements and the mfs predicted at the edge of the dresselhaus ncs should be experimentally observable . as for the robustness of the flat abss against disorder or impurity , we can discuss it from the topological point of view .",
