    "+ in this paper , we shall discuss the possibility of studying properties of scalar resonances ( direct coupling to @xmath16 ) , and of related processes with positive @xmath17parities ( @xmath18 non - resonant and rescattering s - wave amplitudes ) , in the low - energy region , which remains a long standing puzzle in non - perturbative qcd @xcite , and which may eventually help for solving the @xmath9 and @xmath10-decay data discrepancy .",

    "[ fig : born ] ) , the observation of processes with positive @xmath17parities only occurs via two - photon intermediate state ( table [ tab:2gamma ] ) , which are a priori difficult to observe due to the additionnal qed coupling @xmath19 suppression compared to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : born ]",
    ". however , one may ( a priori ) expect that the interference between the born amplitude in fig . 1 and the one in table [ tab:2gamma ] can be reached at the present experimental accuracy because of the less power of @xmath20 in the interference term relative to the diagonal one . + in the following , we plan to study this process , from the @xmath0-odd asymmetry angular distribution : _ ps - d(-)d_born  , [ aps ] which can differentiate the @xmath0-even and @xmath0-odd parities ( the born cross - section refers to the process in fig .

    "+ we shall not consider the process with a real photon emission @xmath29 ( unless technically necessary for cancelling ir divergences ) , because they are usually absorbed into the radiative corrections already included into the monte - carlo programs or can be disentangled from the virtual photon process by tagging the real photon [ the so - called initial state radiation ( isr ) method used e.g. at kloe and babar ] . to the order at which we are working ,",
    "the only relevant of such diagrams is the interference between the amplitude where a photon is initially emitted from the lepton ( isr ) with the amplitude where the photon is emitted from the pion ( fsr ) ( the other ones are @xmath0-even : see e.g. @xcite ) , which we shall call later on ifsr process .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , the asymmetry of the ifsr process can be clearly measured at large photon angle and can be a direct measure of the ratio of the fsr over the isr amplitude .",
    "the kloe measurement of this ifsr quantity agrees with monte - carlo simulations , where the later use a model with pointlike pions ( the pion will be also treated as a point - like particle in our calculation ) .",

    "this project may be realized at enough small polar angle between the electron beam and outgoing @xmath59 in high - statistic and hig - precision present and future experiments with a good pion identification .",

    "this feature being relevant in e.g. the analytic k - matrix model discussed in @xcite , where one can separate the direct coupling of the scalar resonance to @xmath16 from the rescattering contribution .",
    "the null contribution of the @xmath83 exchange in the s - channel , i.e. of the @xmath84 part of the s - wave amplitude , may indicate that the non - zero contributions from the box diagram are only due to the @xmath85 part of the s - wave amplitude .",
