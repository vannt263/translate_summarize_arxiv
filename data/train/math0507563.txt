    "this implies that these reduced grbner bases are all distinct , which completes the proof .",
    "while the grbner fan is a fundamental object which has had a range of applications ( the grbner walk @xcite , integer programming ( example [ ti ] ) ) , many computer algebra experts do not like it .",
    "their view is that _ the grbner fan is a combinatorial artifact which is marginal to the real goal of computing the variety of @xmath21_. while this opinion has some merit , the story is entirely different for the subfan @xmath23 of the grbner fan . in our view , _ the tropical variety the variety of @xmath21_. every point on @xmath23 furnishes the starting system for a _ numerical homotopy _ towards the complex variety of @xmath21 , see ( * ? ? ?",
