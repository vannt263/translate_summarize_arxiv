    "functions on euclidean space @xmath7 which are symmetric with respect to the permutation group @xmath8 are often dealt with in various branches of physics , namely in quantum theory or in theory of integrable systems .",
    "it is natural to consider restriction of the symmetry to the subgroup @xmath9 of @xmath8 consisting of transformations @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "of some importance may also be the fact that @xmath12 , while @xmath13 .",
    "functions , considered in the paper , form a new family of special functions , called the alternating exponential functions .",
    "they were introduced in @xcite for @xmath9 , involving general number , @xmath14 , of variables , but otherwise have not appeared in the literature . here",
    "they depend on the smallest ( nontrivial ) number of real variables , namely three . in 2d",
    "the functions would become a product of two simple exponential functions each depending on one variable only . in 1d the analogous functions can not be defined . through the inclusion @xmath15 they are closely related to symmetric and antisymmetric exponential functions , based on @xmath8 , which are described in @xcite . through the isomorphism @xmath16 they are also related to the @xmath17 and @xmath18functions @xcite based on the weyl group @xmath19 of @xmath20 .",
    "the relation is a consequence of the isomorphism @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the even subgroup of @xmath23 . hence the functions of the paper could have been obtained , in principle , from the @xmath1functions of @xmath24 ,",
    "see @xcite .    as a motivation for studying the functions of this paper",
    ", one can single out several reasons .",
    "( i ) they are relatively simple when expressed as sums of common exponential functions of tree real variables measured in orthogonal directions of the 3-dimensional real euclidean space @xmath25 .",
    "( ii ) their continuous orthogonality , when integrated over the finite region @xmath26 , as well as their discrete orthogonality when their values are sampled on a fragment @xmath27 of the cubic lattice , make them into a curious alternative to the simple concatenation of three 1dimensional transforms taken in the orthogonal directions .",
    "comparison of the two transforms deserves further exploration .",
    "( iii ) the alternating symmetry should be advantageous in describing quantum systems possessing such a symmetry , as well as in some problems of quantum information theory .",
    "in general , the @xmath1functions are related to irreducible characters of compact simple lie groups @xmath28 through the @xmath17 and @xmath18functions of @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18functions are defined by the summation of exponential functions over an orbit of the weyl group @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30-functions are defined by the summation of exponential functions over the even subgroup @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "these functions were recently studied as special functions with many practically useful properties . in lie theory",
    "they are known from the weyl formula for the characters of irreducible representations of the compact lie group  @xmath28 .",
    "note that the group @xmath9 is not a reflection group .",
    "therefore it has no associated root system .",
    "the alternating exponential functions of three variables are most likely to be used in 3d applications due to their relative simplicity and to the fact that their variables are given with respect to an orthonormal basis",
    ". practical aspects of their applicability still need to be evaluated and compared with other systems of orthogonal functions . in the lowest case properties , we want to emphasize , are transparent and can be exploited to details not accessible to the analysis in general dimension .",
    "the simplicity of the functions offers an advantage that may also be decisive .",
    "our goals are to describe ( i ) discretization of the functions , ( ii ) expansions of digital data given on lattices of any density , and ( iii ) the interpolation of the data in ` fourier space ' , i.e. in the space of the coefficients of the expansions .    in section",
    "2 the functions are defined and their basic properties are shown .",
    "their relation to @xmath1functions of the lie group @xmath2 , their continuous and discrete orthogonalities and the corresponding fourier expansions are given . in section  3 the interpolation with alternating group functions",
    "is described and exemplified .",
    "concluding remarks are contained in section  4 .",
    "three dimensional alternating exponential functions @xmath32 have the following explicit form @xmath33 where the determinant with superscript @xmath34 stands for _ permanent _ @xcite , which is symmetric with respect to permutations of its rows and columns .    note that in less than three variables , the definition leads to common functions . for two variables ,",
    "we have @xmath35 as a product of two exponential functions , each depending on one of the variables . for one - dimensional case",
    "we obtain @xmath36 .    from",
    "we immediately have symmetry of @xmath37 with respect to cyclic permutations of variables  @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 therefore , we consider only functions @xmath41 with so called _ semidominant _ @xmath42 , that is triples @xmath42 with @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "the set of all semidominant triples is denoted by @xmath45 .    the functions @xmath46 with @xmath47 have additional symmetries induced by the periodicity of exponential function : @xmath48",
    "the relations ( [ expant ] ) and ( [ expper ] ) imply that it is sufficient to consider the functions @xmath46 , @xmath47 on the closure of the _ fundamental domain _",
    "@xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental domain @xmath49 can be chosen in 3d to be equal to the part of the cube shown on figure  [ fig : funddom ] , @xmath50    for @xmath51 , we also have @xmath52     and the grid @xmath53 , given by ( [ origgrid ] ) , inside @xmath49.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]   and the grid @xmath53 , given by ( [ origgrid ] ) , inside @xmath49.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]      the @xmath17 and @xmath18functions of @xmath2 are defined by the summation of exponential functions over an orbit of the weyl group @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath1functions are defined by the summation over the even subgroup @xmath55 .",
    "let us show that @xmath1functions coincide , after a suitable linear substitution of variables , with the functions which are obtained by symmetrizing three dimensional alternating exponential functions @xmath41 over the subgroup @xmath55 .",
    "to make this connection clear we introduce the following non - orthogonal bases expressed in terms of orthogonal vectors @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 : @xmath59    assuming that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the short simple roots and @xmath62 is the long simple root of @xmath2 , we take @xmath63 , that is @xmath64 the scalar product of two vectors , one given in the @xmath65-basis and the other in the dual @xmath66-basis of @xmath2 , is calculated as follows : @xmath67    an orbit of @xmath54 consists of all the distinct points ( weights ) obtained from the dominant point @xmath68 by repeated applications of reflections @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in mirrors orthogonal to the simple roots @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 of @xmath2 , according to the formula @xmath72 a generic @xmath54-orbit consists of 48 points / weights .",
    "we consider only even subgroup @xmath55 of the weyl group which consists of 24 elements .",
    "the generic orbit of the group @xmath55 is written down in table [ tab : weightsc3 ] .",
    ".the generic orbit in the @xmath65-basis of the even subgroup of the weyl group @xmath54 ; weights are sorted according to a minimal number @xmath73 of reflections used to generate them . [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a family of special functions that is a finitely generated ring can generally be transformed into a polynomial ring .",
    "the basis of the ring is taken as the set of variables of the polynomials",
    ". then decomposition of products of the ring of functions allows one to build recursively the polynomials .    in our case that would be the polynomials in @xmath74 real variables chosen as the lowest alternating functions .",
    "discretization of the functions then provides discrete version of the polynomials .",
    "some information of the discretized @xmath1functions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 is already available @xcite .",
    "however , probably a logical preference should be given to description of discretized two and three variable @xmath30-polynomials before the alternating polynomials .",
    "that is not found in the literature so far .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath1 and alternating polynomials should be useful .",
    "interpolation of discrete data by means of discrete fourier expansions is an important practical problem for some applications @xcite .",
    "relatively simple possibilities , shown in the paper , deserve to be further analyzed / optimized .",
    "the connection between the ( anti)symmetric exponential functions @xcite and the ( anti)symmetric trigonometric functions @xcite was described in detail for the two dimensional case in @xcite .",
    "an analogous connection is to be expected for the three - dimensional alternating functions and the alternating trigonometric functions @xcite .    in our opinion",
    "timely and valuable would be a review and comparison of available systems of orthogonal functions in two and three variables .",
    "numerous systems are available .",
    "for example , there are seven semisimple lie groups of rank 3 .",
    "each has at least two systems of orthogonal functions , in fact majority of them admits four such systems of functions .",
    "in addition one should add all the @xmath1functions and alternating functions .",
