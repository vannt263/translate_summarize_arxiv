    "the ligo gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors are currently taking data at design sensitivity , and embarking on long science runs . promising gw sources potentially detectable by ligo are coalescing binary systems containing neutron stars ( nss ) and/or black holes ( bhs) see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . because of the enormous gw luminosity @xmath2 , binary black hole ( bbh ) inspirals are among the most promising candidates for a first detection of gws @xcite .    for ligo - type detectors , even highly energetic bbh inspirals",
    "are predicted to be detected at a rate of only @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , the next generation of interferometric detectors , planned to go online in the next decade , should be sensitive to an abundance of sources , with event rates 1000 times greater than current detectors .",
    "these ` advanced ' interferometers will provide a new window to the cosmos not accessible by conventional astronomy .",
    "+ the introduction of advanced detectors will allow us to detect bbh inspiral events out to a distance of @xmath4 .",
    "events within this volume will contribute to the low probability ` popcorn ' component of the astrophysical gw background for bbhs .",
    "it has been shown that the temporal and spatial distribution of transient sources which form this part of the gw background can be described by the probability event horizon ( peh ) concept of @xcite .",
    "+ the peh describes the temporal evolution of the brightness of a class of transient events .",
    "the probability of a nearby event accumulates with observation time , so that the peak event amplitude has a statistical distribution dictated by the rate density and spacetime geometry .",
    "this feature provides a tool to model the detectability of a distribution of transient gw sources .",
    "@xcite used the peh to model the detectability of ns inspirals as a function of observation time assuming ligo and advanced ligo sensitivities and reasonable estimates of the local rate density of events in the nearby universe , @xmath0 .",
    "+ in this study we consider the use of the peh method to determine the local rate density of bbh coalescence events .",
    "we use a cosmological model to create synthetic data corresponding to four months data at advanced ligo sensitivity .",
    "we then attempt to recover the assumed rate density .",
    "+ first we use the conventional approach of studying the brightness distribution of all events .",
    "this method does not make use of the time evolution .",
    "it simply utilizes the number - amplitude distribution and fits the observations to the rate density .",
    "we compare this with the peh method , which utilizes the temporal distribution of events . for simplicity",
    ", we use a standard candle approximation to model our source population .",
    "we note that a network of detectors would allow us to exploit a special property of compact binary inspiral events , for which the _ chirp _ signal provides a measure of the luminosity distance to the source , enabling such sources to be treated as standard candles @xcite . + to test both methods , we simulate a candidate population of bbh inspiral events by approximating the output data stream resulting from matched filtering . a simplified detection model ( described in section 5.1 )",
    "is used which assumes gaussian detector noise .",
    "we use the candidate population to show that the temporal evolution of events has a unique statistical signature and exploit this signature to constrain @xmath0 . to determine the effect of detector efficiency we apply both methods to data corresponding to high and low false alarm rates .",
    "we also consider the effect of different star formation rate ( sfr ) models and determine bias introduced by different sfr evolution functions .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review event rate predictions and then discuss the evolution of the event rate of bbh inspirals in section 3 . in section 4 , we explain the peh concept and show how it can be used to probe the source rate density and to differentiate between different astrophysical populations of sources .",
    "we describe the simulation of candidate events in section 5 and use these data in section 6 to determine an estimate of @xmath0 using the brightness distribution of sources . in section 7 we present a method for extracting peh data and use least - squares fitting to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "we present our results in section 8 and in section 9 summarize the key findings and discuss how this work can be extended .",
    "the local rate density of a particular astrophysical gw source is fundamental to estimating the number of potentially observable events .",
    "usually defined within a volume spanning the virgo cluster of galaxies , the local rate density , @xmath0 , is determined using estimated source rates within a larger fixed volume of space .",
    "in the case of ns - ns inspirals , current rate estimates rely on a small sample of sources .",
    "the discovery of the double pulsar psr j07373039 , with estimated coalescence time @xmath5 myr , increased the estimated inspiral rate for double nss in our galaxy by about an order - of - magnitude to @xmath6 @xcite with respect to earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "the rates of bbh systems are even more uncertain . because these systems have not been observed directly , their evolutionary parameters can be obtained only though population synthesis , which predicts galactic event rates @xmath7 .",
    "however , gw emissions from bbh will be detectable out to much greater distances than other systems of coalescing compact objects @xcite .",
    "the rates of bh - ns inspirals are of a similar range to those of bh - bh systems , but have lower expected detection rates as a result of their less energetic emissions .    in this study",
    ", we use the galactic bbh coalescence rate @xmath8 , obtained from the standard model in the population synthesis calculations of @xcite .",
    "we note that this rate is an upper limit .",
    "we convert this to a rate per unit volume , @xmath0 , using the conversion factor @xmath9 from @xcite for the number density of galaxies in units of @xmath10 , yielding the reference value of the local rate density , @xmath11 , which we will employ in this study .",
    "rate estimates will benefit greatly from the introduction of advanced gw detectors , which will allow unobscured source counts to be conducted to almost cosmological volumes .",
    "a network of detectors will improve the sky coverage and source localization .",
    "a network may employ coherent analysis , in which synchronized detector outputs are merged @xcite before a search for a common pattern , or alternatively , a coincidence analysis , in which individual events from different detectors are correlated in time @xcite .",
    "however , as a result of the non - uniform antenna patterns , even a network of three detectors of similar sensitivity will have difficulty obtaining maximum efficiency @xcite .",
    "in addition , the efficiency of a detector network for a particular source type will depend on the false alarm rate and the signal - to - noise threshold for detection  therefore high number counts may be balanced by an increased rate of false alarms .",
    "we will investigate this in section 6 .",
    "for standard friedman cosmology a differential event rate in the redshift shell @xmath12 to @xmath13 is given by :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the cosmology - dependent co - moving volume element and @xmath16 is the all - sky ( @xmath17 solid angle ) event rate , as observed in our local frame , for sources out to redshift @xmath12 .",

    "they based their assumptions on short merger times and showed that a time delay of up to 5 gyr had minimal effect on the differential rate of events at low redshift .",
    "however , in comparison with ns - ns systems , for which the distribution of merger times has a large range , peaking at around 0.3myr @xcite , the merger time distributions of bbh systems are predominantly skewed towards longer merger times  from about 100 myr to the hubble time @xcite .",
    "belczynski et al .",
    "used population synthesis methods to calculate the properties and coalescence rates of compact binaries .",
    "they used a range of different scenarios defined by the initial physical parameters of the binary system such as component masses , orbital separations and eccentricities .",
    "they also included properties which affect the evolutionary channels of the system , such as mass transfer , mass losses due to stellar winds and kick velocities .",
    "their calculations implied that , compared to ns - ns systems , the wider orbits and stronger dependence of merger time on initial separation for bh - ns and bh - bh systems resulted in longer merger times , mostly in the range 0.1 to several gyr ( belczynski et al . section 3.4.5 ) .",
    "a standard model was defined by @xcite using a range of assumptions , including : a non - conservative mass transfer with half the mass lost by the donor lost by the system ; a kick velocity distribution that accounts for the fact that many pulsars have velocities above 500 km @xmath36 ; constant galactic star formation for the last 10 gyr .",
    "for this model they found a distribution in bbh merger times that peaked at  1 gyr .",
    "we therefore take this value as an average merger time and shift @xmath31 to reflect this delay time . using the method described in section 2 of @xcite",
    ", we can convert @xmath18 to a function of cosmic time , @xmath37 , using the relation    @xmath38^{-1}\\hspace{0.5mm}dz\\hspace{0.5mm}'\\hspace{0.5mm}.\\ ] ]    we apply a 1 gyr time shift and then convert back to a function of @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ fig_ez ] shows the factor @xmath18 for sf2 with and without the time delay .",
    "the result shows that within the range of advanced ligo , @xmath39 , @xmath18 is not significantly altered .",
    "therefore , although we include this time delay in our calculations , within the ranges of advanced ligo detectors it will not have a significant influence on the results .",
    "figure [ fig_rz ] shows the all - sky bbh coalescence rate , @xmath40 , calculated by integrating the differential rate from the present epoch to redshift @xmath12 . using sf2",
    ", the rate continues increasing to distances well beyond the cosmological volume elements considered in this study .",
    "we therefore assume a universal rate of events , @xmath41 ( usually defined as the asymptotic value of the all - sky rate as @xmath12 increases ) of @xmath42 and a corresponding mean temporal interval @xmath43s .",
    "figure [ fig_rz_low ] shows the all - sky bbh coalescence rate for sources within advanced ligo sensitivities .",
    "the potential detection horizon extends to @xmath44 and the corresponding mean rate of events is @xmath45 using sf2 .",
    "if we assume all sources are composed of two @xmath46 black holes , this rate corresponds to around 874 events @xmath47 with snr @xmath48 .",
    "the rate , as observed in our frame , of transient astrophysical events occurring throughout the universe , is determined by their spatial distribution and evolutionary history .",
    "the distribution of event observation times follows a poisson distribution and the temporal separation between events follows an exponential distribution defined by the mean event rate . for cosmological events ,",
    "the rate depends on the cosmology dependent volume and radial distance through redshift , @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that an observer measures both a temporal location and a ` brightness ' for each event , where the brightness is determined by the luminosity distance to the event .",
    "it follows from these assumptions that the probability for at least one event to occur in the volume bounded by @xmath12 , during observation time @xmath49 at a mean rate @xmath16 at constant probability @xmath50 is given by the exponential distribution :    @xmath51    @xmath52 being the probability of at least one event occurring ( see coward & burman 2005 ) .    for equation ( [ prob2 ] ) to remain satisfied as observation time increases",

    "we define a ` null peh ' , representing the 95% probability that no events will be observed within this threshold , by setting @xmath58 . when combined , we refer to these two pehs as the 90% peh band  that is 90% of events",
    "are expected to occur in the region enclosed by the two pehs . by scaling some fiducial gw amplitude by @xmath59",
    ", we express the 90% peh band as 90% confidence bounds of peak gw amplitude against observation time .",
    "figure [ fig_peh_lrd ] shows the euclidean 95% peh curves for bbh , using three different values of @xmath19 , differing by an order of magnitude .",
    "we note that for a particular transient gw source population , the peh is intrinsically dependent on @xmath19 .",
    "the plot shows that for a particular source type , the peh model can be used to estimate the value of @xmath19 .    .",
    "the peh curve corresponding to the reference value of the local rate density , @xmath60 , used in this study is shown by the solid line .",
    "an increase in @xmath0 by an order of magnitude shifts the peh curve towards earlier observation times ( dashed line ) .",

    "the concept is very simple : the longer one observes the greater the probability of a nearby event  the peh filter quantifies this dependence as a means of probing the cosmological rate density .",
    "the peh filter searches for the time dependence of event amplitudes which is imposed by their cosmological distribution .",
    "it is a non - linear filter applied to a body of data by recording successively closer events .",
    "we will apply the technique to a distribution of amplitudes , @xmath63 , as a function of observation time , @xmath64 , recording the successive @xmath65 that satisfy the condition @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting events will be referred to as the ` peh population ' .    by fitting to peh data",
    "we can probe the local rate density of an astrophysical population .",
    "we note that just as brightness distributions can be used to separate and identify different source populations , so also can different source populations be identified in peh plots .",
    "figure [ fig_peh_sources ] demonstrates this property by comparing synthetic peh populations of bbh and ns - ns inspirals .",
    "for the two source types we use a standard candle approximation based on an optimal snr of 8 assuming an advanced ligo detector with a fiducial distance of 200 mpc for ns - ns inspirals and 2 gpc for bbh inspirals .",
    "we show the 90% peh bands for the two populations as a snr .",
    "it is evident that if the peh signature of an astrophysical gw background could be extracted from detector noise , the presence of different astrophysical backgrounds could be identified .",
    "clearly this method will only work if the luminosities of the populations differ widely . in reality",
    ", different luminosities will also be associated with different waveforms , and there are likely to be more evident differences than the simple luminosity effects .",
    "we will consider only the well understood inspiral stage of a bbh coalescence to provide quantitive data for our source model . to model the gw background from bbh inspirals it is sufficient to assume that the raw interferometer data is preprocessed by passing it through an optimal filter .",

    "the filter response amplitude , @xmath63 , will be dependent on the masses of the bbh system . for simplicity , rather than using a distribution of bbh masses , we use a standard source model . using the _ _ bench _ _",
    "code to model the detector noise spectrum , we approximate the gw amplitude for an optimum snr of 80 at 200 mpc .    by assuming a standard bbh system we ignore the amplitude distribution from the bh mass spectrum .",
    "however , this assumption is not a limitation to the peh method because the signature of an inspiralling binary system contains a measure of its luminosity distance @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a network of gw detectors , the analysis described in this paper could be repeated using luminosity distances rather than amplitudes .",

    "the small gradient of the noise peh in comparison with the astrophysical peh curve highlights the fact that the temporal evolution of the gaussian detector noise , highly dependent on the sampling frequency , is much slower , a result of the low probability of events in the tail of the distribution @xcite .",

    "in addition , we show the 90% gaussian noise amplitude peh curves ( dashed lines ) , which illustrate the temporal amplitude evolution of gaussian detector noise .",

    "an additional threshold , shown by the dot - dashed line , is constructed by combining the null - peh curves from both populations .",
    "this threshold is the 95% amplitude upper limit for our bbh inspiral peh population  this curve represents the result of obtaining maximum amplitudes for both the noise and sources .",
    "we now want to determine the key astrophysical parameter , the source local rate density @xmath0 , from data such as that presented in the previous section .",
    "first we will consider the conventional method of determining source rate densities based on the brightness distribution of sources .",
    "this will allow us to quantify the effectiveness of the peh in determining the local rate density of bbh events .",
    "the log n  log p source count distribution @xcite is the number of events @xmath113 , of luminosity @xmath114 and peak flux @xmath115 , within a maximum redshift , @xmath116 , recorded by a detector of flux limit @xmath117 . such a distribution can be fitted to a predicted log n ",

    "we convert peak flux to a maximum gw amplitude , @xmath63 , yielding a log n  log a distribution of the form :    @xmath118    where @xmath119 represents the observation time and the differential event rate , @xmath85 , is given by equation [ drdz ] . in comparison with the log n  log p distribution , which has a gradient of @xmath120 under a euclidean geometry ,",
    "the log n  log a has a slope of @xmath121 .",
    "the curve includes a noise component which approximates the average contribution from detector noise and is scaled by a factor 0.4 , the mean value of the antenna response function for a single gw detector @xcite . by fitting to 100 synthetic data sets ,",
    "we find these approximations introduce a systematic error of @xmath122 to the final estimates .",
    "to fit the candidate event population , @xmath107 , against the log n  log a curve , we consider two scenarios : firstly an idealized case , in which the detector has correctly resolved all the injected events in @xmath107 ; secondly a suboptimum case , in which the data consists of both injected signals and false alarms . to implement",
    "the first scenario we eliminate any false alarms by including only event triggers that correspond to injected signals . for the second scenario we use the whole candidate population of event triggers and false alarms . in section 8",

    "we have shown that the peh filter allows an independent estimate of the rate density of bbh coalescence events detected by advanced gw detectors .",
    "the main results and their limitations are summarized below :    1 .   for a candidate population of bbh with galactic inspiral rate @xmath123 ,",
    "a fit to 4 months of interferometer data was sufficient to obtain estimates of @xmath0 to within a factor of 2 at the 90% confidence level . + by applying both brightness distribution and peh methods to data streams with a high false alarm rate we find that the brightness distribution method is the more accurate if the detector is operating at high efficiency .",
    "for the case in which the data contains a large proportion of false alarms , we find the peh fit gives less bias .",
    "this is because this method naturally suppresses low - amplitude false - alarms .",
    "of the two methods , the peh method has lower resolution due to the fact that fewer events contribute to the data .",
    "the overall performance of the peh filter suggests that it is accurate enough to be considered as an additional tool to determine event rate densities , particularly if the detector is operating at low efficiency .",
    "a combination of the peh and brightness distribution methods provides two independent estimates of @xmath0 .",
    "the combination of both estimates provides a self consistent test and also increases the overall precision of the rate estimates .",
    "one disadvantage of the peh filter , in comparison with fitting to the amplitude distribution , is that it uses only a small sample of the overall data set .",
    "we are investigating techniques to increase the sample size .",
    "initial results suggest that applying the peh filter in both temporal directions can increase the overall peh population and improve the resolution and accuracy of the estimates",
    ". this technique will be particularly useful in data sets in which a large event occurs after a comparatively short observation time .",
    "we note that the value for reference local rate density , @xmath60 , obtained from the population synthesis calculations of @xcite , is at the upper end of predictions .",
    "we plan to investigate the performance of the peh method for lower values of @xmath60 for which we expect a smaller number of events in the peh distribution .",
    "initial calculations suggest that an order of magnitude decrease in @xmath60 will result in a peh population of around 7  11 events for a 4-month data set rather than the 15  22 events expected for @xmath60 used in this study . as discussed previously , techniques in which we can increase the peh sample will be of great importance for astrophysical populations with lower rate densities .",
    "+ 4 .   for the noise levels considered in this study ,",
    "the peh fits are only weakly affected by the inclusion of false alarms , but estimates using a brightness distribution are shown to degrade .",
    "this implies that the peh method may be most effective when applied to data output from signals that are not well modelled , such as transient burst sources , for which we expect a substantial number of false alarms to be present .",
    "recent developments in the modelling of gw emissions from core - collapse supernova ( sne ) suggest that the detectable background population of such sources may be numerous enough to apply the peh technique @xcite .",
    "the peh filter , by definition includes the temporal distribution of the sources , hence provides a means of predicting the energies of future events .",
    "our results show that at the detector sensitivity assumed here , the value of @xmath0 can not be separated from evolution effects , so that different sfr curves create bias in the estimated value of @xmath0 . for larger spans of data and more sensitive detectors such as euro @xcite it may be possible to fit the peh data or the brightness distribution to determine the entire function @xmath16 .",
