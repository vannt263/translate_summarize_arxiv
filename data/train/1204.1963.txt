    "because the wind of eta car is extremely dense , the continuum and line formation regions are much more extended than the size of the hydrostatic core . in addition , the formation region of spectral lines is more extended than that of the continuum in the uv and optical . at these wavelengths , we anticipate that spectral lines will be more affected by the wwc cavity at apastron than the continuum . here",
    ", we investigate thoroughly the reasons behind these effects since , in stellar winds , the formation of spectral lines is significantly more complex than the continuum formation .",
    "the formation region of spectral lines depends not only on the line opacity and emissivity , but on the energy levels involved in the transition , ionization potential ( ip ) of the species , non - lte effects , and the line formation mechanism ( i.e , recombination , resonance , continuum / line fluorescence , etc ; see e.g. , mihalas 1978 ) . in dense winds such as that from @xmath21 , the ionization structure is stratified , and generally lines from species with high ip form closer to the star than lines from elements with low ip . therefore , spectral lines that are formed over a larger region of the wind of @xmath21  are expected to be more affected by the presence of the wwc cavity .",
    "spectral lines formed in the innermost regions of @xmath21 s wind , where the wwc cavity does not penetrate , will not be greatly affected .    as an initial assessment of",
    "which spectral lines will be affected by the wwc cavity , we investigate the spatial region where the flux from different spectral lines originate in the 1-d cmfgen model of @xmath21 . recalling that , in a spherically symmetric outflow , the flux in the observer s frame at a given frequency @xmath31 is ( e.g. , mihalas 1978 ) @xmath32 we investigate the behavior of the flux - like quantity @xmath33 as a function of impact parameter @xmath34 , from the far - uv to the near - ir ( fig .  [ pipimages ] ) .",
    "this provides a first estimate of which lines will be affected by the cavity , since _ lines which have a significant fraction of their flux coming from @xmath35 will be the ones more affected by the cavity .",
    "_    figure  [ pipimages ] shows that the wwc cavity should affect the uv region even during apastron , especially in regions dominated by fe@xmath2ii lines ( e.g , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "this happens because , for @xmath21 , fe@xmath2ii lines are formed over very large spatial scales . in the optical and near - ir , the main lines that have formation regions larger than @xmath40 at apastron",
    "are h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and fe@xmath2ii lines .    however , we stress that , because @xmath41 is a quantity projected on the sky , the actual magnitude of the effects depends on the orientation of the wwc cavity .",
    "in addition , because the spectral lines are formed in an expanding outflow , different velocity regions of a spectral line form at different spatial regions ( fig . [ pipimages ] ) . we find that spherical symmetry is broken by the presence of a wwc cavity and , depending on its orientation , different velocity regions of a spectral line are affected differently by the presence of low - density material within the cavity .",
    "_ as a consequence , the presence of the wwc cavity causes certain spectral lines to be latitude and azimuth dependent , in particular h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and fe@xmath2ii lines . _    moreover , as @xmath25  moves in its eccentric orbit , @xmath40 and the orientation of the wwc cavity change .",
    "therefore , spectral lines that are not expected to be affected by the wwc cavity at apastron , such as the higher balmer and paschen lines , could be affected at phases around periastron .",
    "this occurs because higher balmer and paschen lines form in the inner , undisturbed regions of the wind of @xmath24 around apastron , where the wwc cavity does not penetrate . at later @xmath42 ,",
    "however , @xmath40 is smaller and the wwc cavity likely disturbs the formation region of the higher balmer and paschen lines . in addition , because of the change in the wwc cavity orientation as a function of @xmath42 , lines that were affected at apastron at a given velocity interval will be affected at different velocity intervals around periastron .",
    "ultimately , the presence of the wwc cavity will produce _ phase - locked variations in spectral lines_.    here we focus on the effects of the wwc cavity at phases around apastron . for a wwc cavity orientation with @xmath43 and @xmath44 ,",
    "our 2-d models show that the wind of @xmath25  carves mainly the front - side of the wind of @xmath21 , which contains material outflowing toward the observer ( fig .",
    "[ vellos ] ) .",
    "only a relatively minor portion of @xmath21 s wind flowing tangentially to or away from the observer is affected by the wwc cavity .",
    "_ therefore , the blue - shifted part of the line profiles should be the most affected by the wwc cavity during apastron .",
    "_    indeed , this scenario is confirmed by our 2-d radiative transfer calculations .",
    "for orbital orientations corresponding to the observer looking down the rarified cavity at apastron , the amount of fe@xmath45 in the line - of - sight is extremely reduced , causing less absorption of continuum radiation by fe@xmath2ii transitions .",
    "therefore , the 2-d cavity model has much less iron blanketing than the 1-d cmfgen model.this effect is most pronounced in spectral regions full of fe@xmath2ii lines , such as around 13501450    and 18002600   .",
    "the extreme line overlap makes it complex to interpret individual features , which are usually blends of many spectral lines .",

    "we investigate in detail the effects of the cavity for h@xmath0 , which is a recombination line formed over a large volume of the stellar wind .",
    "analog effects are seen in the other unblended spectral lines , such as h@xmath1 and fe@xmath2ii lines .",
    "we find that the 1-d model has strong blueshifted absorption at @xmath34 smaller than the photospheric size at 6564   and no emission from larger @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ iphalpha]a ) .",
    "in contrast , the 2-d cavity model shows blueshifted emission at large @xmath34 in directions toward where the cavity is projected on the sky ( nw in this case , fig . [ iphalpha]c ) .",
    "a 2-d model including only the wwc cavity but no dense wwc zone ( fig . [ iphalpha]b ) presents a similar behavior , showing that the key factor is the presence of a wwc cavity in the wind of @xmath21 .",
    "the enhanced blueshifted emission at large @xmath34 is caused by the reduced optical depth because of the presence of the wwc cavity , allowing line photons that would otherwise be absorbed by the wind of @xmath21  to escape .",
    "since the flux at a give wavelength is @xmath46 , the net result is a significant decrease in the amount of blueshifted h@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the wwc cavity also has a moderate effect in the emission at zero velocities in h@xmath0 , allowing more line photons to escape toward the observer , but does not significantly change the image morphology ( figs .",
    "[ iphalpha]e , f ) .",
    "because the back side of the primary wind is essentially not carved by the wind of @xmath25  around apastron and remains undisturbed , no effects are seen in the redshifted emission of h@xmath0 when considering the wwc cavity alone ( fig .",
    "[ iphalpha]h ) .",
    "in addition to the wwc cavity , the line emission is also affected by the presence of a dense , shocked wwc zone .",
    "we find that , because of the orientation of the cavity , blueshifted h@xmath0 emission from the wwc zone is roughly aligned with the ne - sw direction , while redshifted emission is higher to the nw ( fig .",
    "[ iphalpha]f , i ) .",
    "this morphology resembles what has been seen in the extended forbidden line emission that originates in the outer , time - averaged wwc zone ( gull et al .",
    "2011 ) , but scaled down by a factor of 30 spatially .",
    "our models predict that h@xmath0 is optically thick , with a sobolev optical depth larger than 1000 in the inner wind ( for @xmath47 au ) . because of that , the zero and redshifted images of h@xmath0 are also affected by absorption of line photons from the _ back side _ of the primary wind by the wwc zone .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for large @xmath48 .",
    "the absorption occurs mainly along the ne - sw direction ( fig .",
    "[ iphalpha]h , i ) , and is caused by the redshifted line - of - sight velocity of material in the wwc zone toward these directions .",
    "building on the insights from previous sections , we compare below the fiducial 2-d cavity model spectrum to the _",
    "hst_/stis  observations obtained at @xmath49 and 10.603 . as discussed below , our 2-d models show the presence of a rarified wwc cavity in the dense wind of @xmath21  is sufficient for reproducing the uv and optical spectra of the central source , without the need of a rapid - rotating @xmath21 . at this point , however , we can not exclude that both scenarios occur simultaneously , with @xmath21  being a rapid rotator .",
    "the uv spectrum of eta car is strongly dominated by bound - bound transitions of fe@xmath2ii believed to originate in the wind of @xmath21  .",
    "while both the revised spherical model presented here and the one from have difficulties fitting the uv spectrum of eta car ( unless light from the inner @xmath50 of the model is blocked ; ) , our 2-d model reproduces reasonably well the uv spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ moduvstandard ] ) .",
    "the quality of the fit improves compared to those from the spherical model because , for the orbital parameters assumed here ( table [ params ] ) , the observer looks down the low - density cavity , which dramatically reduces the column density , and thus opacity and optical depth of fe@xmath2ii transitions in the line - of - sight to @xmath21 .",
    "the end result is less absorption of fe@xmath2ii in the uv spectrum _ while _ still maintaining the @xmath51 of @xmath21  at @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , according to our models , the uv spectrum is satisfactorily explained by the carving of the wind of @xmath21  by @xmath25 , without the need of a  coronagraph \" blocking the inner 0033 , as proposed by .",
    "anomalous extinction could still occur in the line - of - sight to the central source ( sect .",
    "[ conc ] ) .",
    "the fact that our 2-d models reproduce well the uv spectrum indicates that @xmath25  has little flux contribution in the wavelength range analyzed here ( 1250 - 3300   ) .",
    "this suggests that , perhaps , the luminosity of @xmath25  is much lower than previously thought , maybe around a few times @xmath52 and consistent with the lower range of values suggested by @xcite .",
    "further updates of our code to include the flux contribution of @xmath25  are needed to improve knowledge on @xmath25 .",

    "the p - cygni absorption in these lines extends up to @xmath55 around apastron @xcite .",
    "these velocities are consistent with the high - ionization resonance lines being formed in a region dominated by the turbulent velocity field of @xmath21 s wind or in the wwc zone , perhaps moving slightly faster than the terminal speed of @xmath21 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , we speculate that these high - ionization resonance lines arise in modified regions of the wind of @xmath21 , close to the wwc zone , that are photoionized by @xmath25  ( see sect .",
    "[ ionization ] ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of the central @xmath56 of eta car is dominated by strong emission lines from h and fe@xmath2ii @xcite that were shown to arise in the wind of @xmath21  . while the spherical model from",
    "strongly overestimates the amount of p - cygni absorption in these lines , our 2-d model yields much less p - cygni absorption in h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , h@xmath5 , and fe@xmath2ii lines ( fig .",
    "[ modoptstandard ] ) .",
    "the explanation for the better fits is similar to that of the uv spectrum : since the observer looks down the cavity , there is less column density and optical depth in the line - of - sight .",
    "however , the 2-d synthetic spectrum still presents more absorption than seen in the observed spectrum , in particular in h@xmath6 and higher balmer and paschen lines .",
    "the absorption part of these lines arises in regions of the primary wind unaffected by the wwc cavity at apastron , and thus 2-d and 1-d models have similar line profiles .",
    "a plausible explanation for the excess absorption is that the 2-d models currently neglect photoionization of the wind of @xmath21  by @xmath25 .",
    "the assumed orbital and wwc cavity parameters could also be different ( see sects .",

    "weak n@xmath2ii and he@xmath2i lines are also present in the optical spectrum and most authors concur these are , at least during some orbital phases , affected by photoionization of @xmath25  @xcite . in this case , the formation regions of these lines depend on the number of ionizing photons from @xmath25 , which depends mainly on its temperature , luminosity , and mass - loss rate .",
    "we found that the inclusion of the rarified wwc cavity and a dense wwc zone in the model is insufficient to provide better fits for these lines .",
    "as for the higher balmer lines , the he@xmath2i emission and absorption that originates in the primary wind , if any , is unchanged by the presence of the wwc cavity alone at apastron ( fig .  [ modoptstandard ] ) .",

    ", these effects can potentially change the morphology of the images and the amount of flux arising at large impact parameters .",
    "emission and absorption from the wwc zone will be more noticeable in regions of high opacity / emissivity , such as in the uv ( due to bound - free opacities from iron - group elements ) and infrared ( due to free - free processes ) .",
    "on one hand , the material in the wwc zone adds extra opacity in the line - of - sight to the continuum emitting region , which might decrease considerably the flux reaching the observer , depending on @xmath48 ( fig  [ ipuv ] ) . on the other hand , the presence of dense material in regions not covering the continuum source increases the emissivity of these regions . as a consequence",

    "it is worth noting that emission and absorption from the wwc zone will be enhanced at orbital phases around periastron @xcite , since the shock - compressed regions reach deeper into the wind of @xmath21 .",
    "an important prediction of our 2-d models , which include the effects of @xmath25  via the presence of a wwc cavity and wwc zone , is that the morphology of the continuum and spectral line emitting regions should be dependent on the orbital phase . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ipuv ] , our models predict a roundish brightness distribution on the sky at apastron , with some asymmetry depending on the density and ionization structure of the walls of the wwc zone .",
    "our models suggest that the image morphology should get increasingly more asymmetric and elongated at orbital phases closer to periastron @xcite .",
    "this is in markedly contrast with the prediction from a single , rapid - rotator star scenario as proposed by @xcite , where rapid rotation during apastron should produce elongated , asymmetric images @xcite .",
    "in addition , no time dependence in the image morphologies should be seen , unless the rotational velocity of @xmath21  changes across the orbital cycle .",
    "long - baseline optical interferometric observations are currently able to deliver model - independent , reconstructed images that would allow one to test the aforementioned scenarios .",
    "at present , the 2-d code from does not allow for the variation of the ionization stage and level populations as a function of latitude .",
    "therefore , material inside the wwc cavity and along its shocked walls have the same ionization structure as the wind of @xmath21 .",
    "this is admittedly a zero - order approximation in the case of the eta car binary system , mainly because of the two factors elaborated below .",
    "first , @xmath25  supposedly has @xmath113 @xcite and , depending on its luminosity , might be able to ionize hydrogen and other species in a non - negligible fraction of the wind of @xmath21 .",
    "this could affect the p - cygni absorption of hydrogen lines , and give rise to spectral lines of high - ionization stages ( such as si@xmath2iv@xmath53 ) that would otherwise not be present in the spectrum of @xmath21  in a single star scenario .",
    "@xcite estimated the volume of the wind of @xmath21  that is photoionized by @xmath25  and found that a significant fraction of h could be ionized near apastron ( see their fig .",
    "this result has been confirmed by @xcite using independent radiative transfer modeling .",
    "however , as a caveat , both calculations include only h and he , while showed that line blanketing by the fe group elements is a key factor to the h ionization structure in dense stellar winds , as is the case of @xmath21 .",
    "second , material is shocked along the wall , significantly increasing its temperature , and is compressed and radiatively cools on the side of the primary . in addition , ionizing photons from @xmath25  illuminate the post - shocked primary wind , and will affect this material .",
    "hot , post - shocked secondary wind material will also be in line - of - sight and likely emitting in x - rays @xcite .",
    "because of these complications we are unable to self - consistently model the line emission and absorption from the walls of the shock cone",
    ". however , they do not affect the conclusions reached in this paper regarding the wwc _ cavity _ effects .",
    "we note that the effects described above should affect much less the continuum emission and absorption , in particular the near - ir region studied in @xcite .    as a consequence of these limitations ,",
    "our model is not able to reproduce high - ionization lines thought to arise from material photoionized by @xmath25 .",
    "we defer a detailed model of ionization effects to future work , when it will become feasible to couple 3-d radiative transfer tools ( e.g. , simplex ; @xcite ) to 3-d hydrodynamical simulations . nevertheless , despite the limitations , our 2-d models are adequate for understanding how the line profiles of @xmath21  are modified by the carving of its wind by @xmath25 .",
    "we presented the first 2-d radiative transfer modeling of the central source in eta carinae , taking into account the carving of the stellar wind of the primary star that occurs due to the wind of a close companion star .",
    "we investigated the effects of the cavity using multi - wavelength diagnostics around apastron of the orbital cycle .",
    "we believe that the 2-d models presented here pave the way for future work on 3-d , full line blanketed radiative transfer modeling of the eta car binary system , that are warranted to gain further insights on the effects of @xmath25  on @xmath21 .",
    "the 2-d models have several important implications for the understanding of the eta car binary system .",
    "our models predict that the wwc cavity induces latitudinal and azimuthal dependence in the continuum and line profiles , which could be tested observationally with spectra reflected off the ejecta that surrounds the binary system .",
    "such an investigation might provide clues on whether or not @xmath21  is a rapid rotator .",
    "our 2-d models unambiguously show that lines formed over a large volume of the wind of @xmath21 , such as h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and fe@xmath2ii lines , are affected by the cavity even during apastron .",
    "in addition , ionization from @xmath25  may also affect the strength and shape of these lines .",
    "therefore , analyses of long - term variations of eta car , possibly caused by changes in any stellar or wind parameter of one ( or both ) stars , should take into account the effects discussed in this paper .",
    "in addition , the presence of a wwc cavity and wwc zone with an orientation and structure predicted by hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) causes the line - of - sight to the central source to have peculiar conditions .",
    "the combination of a half - opening angle of the wwc cavity @xmath114 and orbital inclination angle @xmath115 implies that the line - of - sight to the central source might cross a significant fraction of the post - shocked , dense regions of the wwc zone . as we discussed in this paper",
    ", emission and absorption of atomic species may occur .",
    "in addition , if dust is able to form along the wwc zone , as suggested from studies of wr binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and eta car itself @xcite , emission from the central source would suffer from dust extinction .",
    "this scenario might explain the anomalous extinction seen towards the central source compared to ejecta just @xmath116 away @xcite , perhaps explaining the  coronagraph \" effect discussed by @xcite .",
    "moreover , eta car has displayed a puzzling photometric brightening in the last century ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and long - term changes in the opening angle of the wwc cavity and/or dust formation rate along the wwc zone might be one of the culprits .    finally , we believe the 2-d models presented here provide the foundation to understand the behavior of spectral lines at phases around periastron , even if 3-d models are ultimately needed because of the wrapping of the wwc cavity around @xmath21 .",
    "our models predict that the amount of p - cygni absorption seen in h and fe@xmath2ii lines depends on the amount of wind of @xmath21 in the line - of - sight to the observer .",
    "since 3-d hydrodynamical simulations show an increase in material from @xmath21 wind in the line - of - sight just after periastron @xcite , we suggest that the increase in the p - cygni absorption of h and fe@xmath2ii lines observed at these phases @xcite is caused by the higher optical depth of these lines due to the increased amount of @xmath21 s wind in the line - of - sight to @xmath21 .",
    "below we summarize our main findings and conclusions .    .",
    "we made a detailed comparison of observed _",
    "spectra near apastron ( @xmath49 and 10.603 ) with 1-d spherical cmfgen radiative transfer models .",
    "we find that a revised wind terminal velocity of @xmath117 provides better agreement with the redshifted part of h and fe@xmath2ii emission lines in the optical spectrum , and the p - cygni absorption component of low - ionization uv resonance lines of c@xmath2ii , si@xmath2ii , fe@xmath2ii , and mg@xmath2ii .",
    "we find the following parameters for our revised spherical cmfgen model of @xmath21 : @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121  =  35200  k ( at @xmath122 ) , @xmath123= 9400  k ( at @xmath124 ) , @xmath125 , assuming a distance of @xmath126 kpc .",
    "we adapted the 2-d radiative transfer code of to account for the modification of the wind of @xmath21  caused by the presence of a low - density wwc cavity and a dense wwc zone .",
    "we investigated in detail the effects of the wwc cavity on spectral lines , showing that two factors dominate the influence : the size of the line formation region compared to the distance of the apex of the wwc cavity , and the orientation of the cavity with respect to the observer . for our preferred orbital orientation with @xmath43 and @xmath44 ,",
    "the wwc cavity affects more the blueshifted and zero velocity parts of spectral line profiles .    according to our 2-d radiative transfer modeling , h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and fe@xmath2ii",
    "lines are the most affected by the wwc cavity , since they form over a large volume of @xmath21 s stellar wind .",
    "the excess p - cygni absorption seen in h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and optical fe@xmath2ii in spherical models becomes much weaker or absent in 2-d cavity models with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , in agreement with the _",
    "hst_/stis  observations around apastron .",
    "the same 2-d model simultaneously provides a superb fit to the observed uv spectrum of eta car at apastron .",
    "the better fits are because the uv spectrum of eta car is strongly dominated by absorption of fe@xmath2ii lines that become significantly weaker when the presence of the low - density wwc cavity is taken into account .",
    "we obtain that orbital orientations with @xmath3 and @xmath4 are needed to simultaneously fit the uv and optical spectrum of eta car around apastron , assuming @xmath0 in the range @xmath127 .",
    "larger values of @xmath0 and/or photoionization of the wind of @xmath21  and wwc zone by @xmath25  could change the range of allowed @xmath57 and @xmath58 slightly .",
    "our models predict that the wwc cavity induces latitudinal and azimuthal dependence in the continuum and line profiles .",
    "in particular , the p - cygni absorption is stronger in spectral lines viewed from @xmath128 than at the central star position .",
    "therefore , our models predict that spectra scattered off the homunculus poles should have stronger p - cygni absorption than those observed on the central star or equatorial positions .",
    "the presence of the wwc cavity thus mimics the effects that could , in principle , also arise in a single , fast - rotating @xmath21 .",
    "our 2-d model indicates that the apex of the wwc cavity does not reach optically - thick regions in the continuum in the uv , optical , and infrared during apastron , and that these regions will be affected by a bore - hole effect only at @xmath92 .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings from @xcite .",
    "we find that for continuum wavelengths with @xmath129 or @xmath130 , the wwc cavity penetrates the @xmath88 surface at apastron . for @xmath129",
    "a pronounced bore - hole effect occurs , increasing by 5 to 10 orders of magnitude the number of photons escaping through the wwc cavity .",
    "however , this extra flux is easily dwarfed by that expected from the hot , luminous companion @xmath25  during apastron .    for @xmath131 ,",
    "even if the wwc cavity does not penetrate the @xmath88 surface at apastron , a flux increase of the order of 1030% is seen in the 2-d model with a wwc cavity open toward the observer compared to the spherical 1-d model .",
    "we found that the flux increase is not only caused by the modification of the optical depth scale of the primary wind , but also by the steeper optical depth dependence of the source function in the uv compared to the optical / near - ir .",
    "we present predictions of continuum images at apastron in the uv , optical , and near - ir , that could be tested observationally with interferometric techniques .",
    "in addition to the bore - hole effect , emission and absorption from the dense walls of the wwc zone might significantly affect the continuum images and flux , depending on the orbital orientation and density of the walls .",

    "<S> we present two - dimensional ( 2-d ) radiative transfer modeling of the eta carinae binary system accounting for the presence of a wind - wind collision ( wwc ) cavity carved in the optically - thick wind of the primary star . by comparing synthetic line profiles with spectra obtained with the _ hubble space telescope_/space telescope imaging spectrograph near apastron </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the wwc cavity has a strong influence on multi - wavelength diagnostics . </S>",
    "<S> this influence is regulated by the modification of the optical depth in the continuum and spectral lines . </S>",
    "<S> we find that h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and fe@xmath2ii lines are the most affected by the wwc cavity , since they form over a large volume of the stellar wind of the primary . </S>",
    "<S> these spectral lines depend on latitude and azimuth since , according to the orientation of the cavity , different velocity regions of a spectral line are affected . for 2-d models with orientation corresponding to orbital inclination angle @xmath3 and longitude of periastron @xmath4 , the blueshifted and zero - velocity regions of the line profiles are the most affected by the cavity . these orbital orientations are required to simultaneously fit the uv and optical spectrum of eta car around apastron , for a half - opening angle of the cavity in the range 5070 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the excess p - cygni absorption seen in h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and optical fe@xmath2ii lines in 1-d spherical models becomes much weaker or absent in the 2-d cavity models , in agreement with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the observed uv spectrum of eta car is strongly dominated by absorption of fe@xmath2ii lines that are superbly reproduced by our 2-d models when the presence of the low - density wwc cavity is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> small discrepancies still remain , as the p - cygni absorption of h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 is overestimated by our 2-d models at apastron . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that photoionization of the wind of the primary by the hot companion star is responsible for the weak absorption seen in these lines . </S>",
    "<S> our cmfgen models indicate that the primary star has a mass - loss rate of @xmath7 and wind terminal velocity of @xmath8 around the 20002001 apastron .    </S>",
