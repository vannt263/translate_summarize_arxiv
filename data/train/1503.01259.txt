    "many astrophysical quantities obey a distribution well described by power - laws .",
    "important insights into the physical processes producing such distributions can be obtained from their power - law index .",
    "in addition , the location at which the distribution departs from a power - law is also of great importance . in most cases ,",
    "a change in the distribution laws is observed at their high end , in the form of either a steepening of the distribution , or an exponential cutoff .",
    "for example , the peak frequency in the synchrotron emission of active galaxies is associated to the largest energy attainable by relativistic electrons and it carries essential constraints on the acceleration and cooling mechanisms .",
    "equally important is the determination of the behavior of the distributions at the low end as it might reveal the presence of , e.g. , a minimum mass for the formation of a star or a galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , the low end behavior is often unaccessible to observations or , in other cases , it is blurred by the emergence of strong selection biases .    in this letter",
    "we focus on the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) of two classes of active galaxies at low redshift , @xmath9 .",
    "the first is formed by low radio power ( lrp ) agn : within the considered redshift limit , most of the radio emitting agn are indeed objects of low power , @xmath10 .",
    "the second consists of bl  lac objects . according to the unified model for agn",
    ", these two rlfs are expected to be connected with each other , as lrp agn should represent the parent population of bl  lac objects . in both cases",
    "the rlfs are observationally well defined over a very broad range of radio power .",
    "the rlf of lrp agn also presents a break at high luminosity .",
    "conversely , at their low luminosity end , both rlfs are well described by a pure power law by current observations , without clear signs of a change in their slopes . in this letter",
    "we show that it is nonetheless possible to constrain the power at which a low luminosity break in the rlf must occur .    throughout the paper we adopt @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13",
    "the number density of agn can not exceed that of their potential hosts : this argument has been used by @xcite and @xcite to constrain the low luminosity behavior of their rlf .",
    "they found that a break must occur at a radio luminosity @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we use the same rationale , but including the information that their hosts , as shown in more detail below , are associated almost exclusively to very large black holes .",
    "the rlf of nearby galaxies extending to the lowest luminosity has been obtained by @xcite .",
    "it is derived from a sample of 7824 radio sources from the 1.4 ghz nvss survey cross - correlated with the second data release of the 6 degree field galaxy survey ( 6dfgs , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite separated radio sources associated to agn from star - forming galaxies relying on their optical spectra .",
    "their resulting rlf covers the range @xmath16 and shows a steepening at high luminosities ( above @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xcite obtained an independent estimate of the agn rlf .",
    "this is slightly shallower ( reaching a luminosity @xmath18 ) but , since their sample is drawn from the sdss , they could take advantage of the optical data to better characterize their properties .",
    "the main result is that their hosts are almost exclusively massive early - type galaxies with black hole masses ( derived from the stellar velocity dispersion adopting the @xcite law ) larger than @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the sdss survey provides us with a highly complete sample that can be used to estimate the number density of galaxies with large black holes . to this purpose",
    ", we analyze the 818,333 galaxies ( mpa - jhu sample hereafter ) in the value - added spectroscopic catalog produced by the max planck institute for astrophysics , and the johns hopkins university , and available at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/ @xcite .",
    "we consider all galaxies from redshift @xmath22 to @xmath23 to ensure a high level of completeness ( see below ) within the largest possible volume , which results in 0.053 gpc@xmath24 .",
    "we then select elliptical galaxies in the mpa - jhu sample by setting a threshold to the concentration index @xmath25 ( e.g.  @xcite ) and to their stellar velocity dispersion adopting , conservatively , @xmath26 , corresponding to @xmath27 , finding @xmath2038,000 objects .",
    "the resulting sample has a high level of completeness . according to @xcite the completeness of the sdss decreases with decreasing apparent magnitude , starting at @xmath20 95% at the sdss spectroscopic limit of @xmath28 , and being still higher than 80% at @xmath29 .",
    "the vast majority of the lrp agn hosts have a magnitude in the range -23.5 @xmath30 -26.5 @xcite .",
    "this translates into @xmath3116.3 at @xmath22 ( and @xmath3217.8 at @xmath33 ) having adopted @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this implies that most of such galaxies in the selected redshift range are included in the mpa - jhu catalog .",
    "we now estimate how the total number of predicted lrp agn varies depending on the behavior of the rlf at low power . a low luminosity break must occur in order to avoid the divergence of the lrp agn number .",
    "the @xcite results suggest that it is located below @xmath35 , where the limited number of observed objects makes the rlf shape uncertain .",
    "we assume that the lrp agn number density follows , below a break luminosity @xmath5 , a power law with an index @xmath36 .",
    "we investigate the effects of varying @xmath36 from 0 ( a flat number count distribution ) to infinity ( equivalent to a sharp cutoff below @xmath37 ) , see the left panel of fig .",
    "we integrate numerically the rlf starting from @xmath38 , a factor of 100 below the observational limit : the total number of predicted lrp agn grows rapidly at decreasing @xmath5 ( fig .  [ rge ] , right panel ) .",
    "for @xmath39 it exceeds the total number of available hosts when @xmath40 , a value that is inconsistent with the @xcite results even assuming that _ all _ massive galaxies host a lrp agn . for larger @xmath36 ( and already for @xmath41 )",
    "the tension with the observations is eased , as we obtain @xmath42@xmath43 . however",
    ", this requires an occupation fraction @xmath44 of 100% , i.e. , all massive galaxies must harbor a radio - source with at least @xmath45 .",
    "the bivariate rlfs , obtained by @xcite splitting the sample into bins of infrared luminosity ( their fig .",
    "16 ) , indicate instead values in the range @xmath46 depending on the host magnitude .",
    "this implies that the values of @xmath37 derived above should be considered as strict lower limits .",
    "we conclude that : 1 ) the rlf of lrp agn must break to a shallower slope for radio luminosities smaller than @xmath47 , and 2 ) the number density below @xmath48 must significantly decrease , leading to a peak in its distribution .",
    "in this section we consider the rlf of bl  lacs at 1.4 ghz .",
    "we adopt the same line of reasoning followed above . in this case",
    ", the constraint on the rlf is derived imposing the requirement that the total number of bl  lacs does not exceed the total number of appropriate ( see below ) radio sources in the same volume .",
    "@xcite provides us with a sample of 18,286 agn obtained by combining the sdss dr7 mpa - jhu sample with the nvss and the first surveys , down to a flux density level of 5 mjy in the nvss .",
    "we consider the same volume as in sect .   2 , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "we select the sources with 1 ) a rest - frame equivalent width of all emission lines smaller than 5   ( the standard threshold for a bl  lac classification , @xcite ) , and 2 ) a flux of the central radio component in the first images larger than 5 mjy . the latter requirement ( based on the measurement of @xcite ) is needed to isolate potential bl  lac objects according to their radio core emission while excluding , e.g. , double lobed sources lacking of a core .",
    "the threshold is set at the same radio flux limit that defines the selected sample and it is included self - consistently in the analysis that follows .",
    "we are left with 524 potential bl  lac objects .",
    "we further check their radio morphology : indeed bl  lacs are only associated with specific radio structures on the kpc scale , being dominated by a compact radio core and , in some cases , showing also a one - sided jet or a halo @xcite .",
    "we found that 49% of the selected sources are instead well defined fanaroff - riley type i or ii ( fr  i or fr  ii ) radio galaxies with sizes larger than 1020 kpc .",
    "the 267 remaining objects are not necessarily all bl  lacs and certainly include intruders , for example , fr  i with size smaller than @xmath2010 kpc that , due to the limited resolution of the first images , are not recognized as such . however , with only a handful of exceptions , the selected objects are all massive early - type galaxies , conforming with the standard lrp agn hosts .    on the other hand , there is the possibility that bl  lacs are so nuclearly dominated to be confused with stars in the sdss images ( and for this reason they might not be included in the mpa - jhu galaxies catalog ) .",
    "however , this possibility can be discarded .",
    "first of all , in the roma - bzcat catalog of bl lacs @xcite there are only 8 objects with 0.05@xmath50 0.1 and covered by the dr7 .",
    "all of them have been selected as sdss spectroscopic targets .",
    "furthermore , the brightest of these objects has a radio luminosity of @xmath51 w hz@xmath52 .",
    "we estimated the corresponding non thermal contribution to the optical ( @xmath53 band ) magnitude for similarly bright objects by assuming , conservatively , a radio - to - optical spectral index of 0.5 , typical of high energy peaked bl lacs @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath54 at @xmath22 ( and @xmath5519.0 at @xmath33 ) , @xmath564 magnitudes fainter than lrp agn hosts .",
    "only much brighter bl  lacs might be confused with stars .",
    "however , very luminous sources have a low space density and indeed no such object , that would have been easily discovered , is known within the volume considered .    we conclude that our estimate of 267 objects is a robust upper limit to the bl  lacs number in our volume .",
    "@xcite derived the rlf of bl  lacs at 5 ghz based on the deep x - ray radio blazar survey .",
    "they obtained a rlf consistent with a single power - law with a slope of 2.12 @xmath57 0.16 in the range @xmath58@xmath59 . by adopting this rlf",
    "we estimate the predicted number of bl  lacs in the selected volume when varying the luminosity , @xmath6 , at which the rlf breaks , see fig .",
    "[ bllac ] . in our calculation",
    "we assume a null radio spectral index , i.e. @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "a steeper radio spectrum would slightly increase the derived limits on @xmath6 . ] to convert from 5 to 1.4 ghz and take into account that objects with radio flux density smaller than 5 mjy are not included in our sample ( this effect causes the flattening of @xmath61 for @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ bllac ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the number of bl  lacs predicted by extrapolating their rlf to low luminosities exceeds the total number of possible hosts for @xmath63@xmath64 , depending on the rlf slope below the break . on the other hand ,",
    "the rlf data points of @xcite exclude @xmath65 .",
    "we conclude that the rlf of bl  lacs must break to a shallower slope for radio luminosities smaller than @xmath66@xmath67 .     in the sdss / dr7 area as a function of the low luminosity break of their rlf , @xmath6 , and of the slope @xmath36 of the number density below the break .",
    "the solid horizontal line represents the total number of radio galaxies ( weak lined and core dominated , see text for details ) in the same volume ; the dashed horizontal line corresponds to a bl  lacs percentage of the selected radio - sources of 10%.,width=328 ]",
    "the results presented indicate that the rlfs at 1.4 ghz of both lrp agn and bl  lacs must decrease their slope at , or just above , the low luminosity limit at which they are currently determined .",
    "this might appear as a contrived coincidence , while , conversely , it is the natural consequence of the behavior of the rlf at low power .",
    "in fact , the number of objects below the break that can be detected in a flux limited survey depends on the radio power as @xmath68 , where @xmath36 is the number density slope for @xmath69 .",
    "the strong dependence on @xmath70 implies that these objects are missing altogether in the currently available surveys ( or at most found in a small number ) and this prevents the rlf determination below @xmath71 .    for lrp agn",
    "we find that the number density below the break must significantly decrease producing a peak in the distribution .",
    "it is tempting to associate the presence of this peak to a minimal level of emission that is invariably associated with a supermassive black hole located at the center of a massive galaxy , which unavoidably accretes gas from the interstellar medium .",
    "the peak might instead correspond to a minimum level of accretion at which a radio jet can be produced .",
    "a better definition of the rlf at low luminosity is essential in this context : in the first case , we expect to find that all potential hosts harbor a lrp agn , albeit of very low luminosity while , in the second alternative , the occupation fraction would never reach 100% .",
    "note that @xcite found a similar dramatic fall of the number density from the analysis of a sample of 179 qsos ( @xmath72 - 23 ) from the sdss in the redshift range 0.2 @xmath73 0.3 , for radio luminosities below @xmath74 ( at 6 ghz ) .",
    "unfortunately , we have only sparse information on the radio properties of massive galaxies below @xmath75 .",
    "these can be obtained with deep targeted observations of nearby galaxies . in the virgo clusters",
    "there are two ( out of 11 ) giant elliptical galaxies lacking of any sign of radio emission down to a limit of @xmath76 @xcite , despite their large mass ( @xmath77 ) and large black hole mass ( @xmath78@xmath79 ) .",
    "the small number statistics prevent us to derive any firm conclusion based on these observations , but they apparently favor the interpretation that not all massive galaxies are able to produce a radio jet .    the two rlfs considered in this letter are expected to be linked with each other . indeed , according to the agn unified scheme ,",
    "bl  lacs are the beamed version of low luminosity agn ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , bl  lacs are objects in which a highly relativistic jet is seen at an angle close to our line of sight .",
    "this accounts for their extreme properties , such as strong flux variability and apparent superluminal motion of radio components .",
    "the effects of relativistic beaming on the rlf was analyzed in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "if the rlf of the parent population of unbeamed objects is described by a broken power law , the break will produce a change of slope in the bl  lac rlf at @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the maximum value of the jet doppler factor distribution is defined as @xmath82^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath83 is the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath84 is the velocity in units of the speed of light , and @xmath85 is the viewing angle .",
    "the exact value of the @xmath86 exponent depends on the geometry of the emitting region . ] .",
    "the ratio between @xmath5 and @xmath87 is a factor @xmath7 , which suggests a value of the doppler factor @xmath88 , remarkably consistent with the typical results obtained from the observations and the model predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this analysis implicitly assumes that all lrp agn produce relativistic jets , a requirement that is not necessarily met by the objects at the very faint end of the rlf .",
    "the consistency between the estimates of the doppler factor we just obtained with the theoretical expectations appears to confirm the overall validity of this assumption .",
    "how can we improve our knowledge of the rlf at low power ?",
    "for lrp agn the lower limit to the break power , @xmath89 , is not far from what is currently accessible to radio observations of large sample of galaxies such as the nvss .",
    "a factor of @xmath20 10 improvement in the flux threshold is already accessible to the jvla and it will be sufficient to measure directly the rlf of lrp agn below the break value we predicted . while waiting for such a survey it is possible to take advantage of the stacking technique ( e.g. @xcite ) to measure the median radio luminosity of the population of massive elliptical galaxies at sub - mjy levels . in case",
    "the number density presents a peak in its distribution , as our results suggest , this median luminosity is predicted to be located close to the peak value ."
