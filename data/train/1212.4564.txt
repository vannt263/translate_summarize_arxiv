    "heavy - ion - irradiated bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 samples also present a fot at low fields though in this case the vortex solid is polycrystalline @xcite .",
    "these findings indicate that the positional order of the solid phase is therefore not relevant for the order of the transition @xcite .",
    "josephson - plasma - resonance measurements reveal the fot corresponds to a single - vortex decoupling process between stacks of pancake vortices in adjacent cuo planes @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is evidence that the first - order transition is actually a single - vortex transition that depends , at best , on the density of the surrounding vortex matter .",
    "this can be further tested by decreasing the sample size down to a few micrometers such that , at low fields , the system size is reduced to only a few vortices .",
    "the fot of vortex matter in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 can be detected at high temperatures , @xmath3 , as a jump in the local flux density , or , in some cases , in the reversible magnetization @xcite , or , alternatively , by a frequency - independent paramagnetic peak in the in - phase component of the first - harmonic of the ac screening signal @xcite .",
    "both features develop at the same field , identified with the first - order transition field @xmath4 .",
    "the irreversible magnetic response of the system in this high - temperature regime is dominated by a surface barrier .",
    "depending on the sample geometry , this barrier can be of the geometrical or bean - livingston type @xcite , while the bulk of the sample remains magnetically reversible @xcite . in the intermediate temperature region @xmath5 ,",
    "bulk pinning increases its relevance on cooling and the paramagnetic peak is masked by bulk shielding currents , entailing a sudden decrease of the ac signal @xcite .",
    "finally , in the low - temperature regime @xmath6k , bulk pinning plays a dominant role and the so - called second - peak effect @xcite or order - disorder transition @xcite is detected .",
    "this transition is manifested as a local increase of the width of dc hysteresis loops @xcite , and as a minimum in ac magnetization loops with the field - location of the feature , @xmath7 , being frequency - independent @xcite .    the persistence of these transition lines when decreasing the sample size down to few vortices is still open to discussion .",
    "whether the thermodynamic @xmath8 transition remains in mesoscopic vortex matter consisting of only a few vortices has , to our knowledge , not yet been investigated .",
    "regarding the @xmath9 transition , two works of the same authors have reported on its disappearance on decreasing the sample system size down to 30@xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "the authors attributed this phenomenology to the sample size becoming smaller than the temperature - dependent larkin - ovchinikov correlation length @xcite down which the vortex structure is insensitive to the pinning potential .",
    "this interpretation is contradictory with their own data since they invoke bulk current arguments for a system that clearly presents a surface - barrier - dominated physics as deduced from the two - quadrant locus of their dc magnetization loops @xcite .",
    "other work reports on a sample - size - dependent @xmath7 , even when not extremely varying the millimeter - range sample size , attributed to a distribution of metastable disordered vortex states with different lifetimes @xcite .    in this work we report on the phase - location of the @xmath8 , @xmath7 , and irreversibility , @xmath10 , lines for _ macroscopic _ and _ micron - sized _ bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystals , with the field applied parallel to the sample c - axis .",
    "we show that the @xmath4 and @xmath7 transition fields do persist down to a system size of the order of hundred vortices .",

    "on cooling at higher fields , shielding currents develop in the sample prior to the appearance of the paramagnetic peak .",
    "nevertheless , fig.[figure3 ] ( b ) shows that the paramagnetic peaks can be detected up to 200oe .",
    "the irreversibility line , identified from the onset of the third - harmonic signal on cooling , is located at temperatures higher than the paramagnetic peak .",

    "the frequency dependence of @xmath34 is obtained from ac magnetization loops measured with a ripple field of 0.9oe rms and frequencies ranging 1.5 to 985hz .",
    "[ figure6 ] ]    the @xmath7 transition field can be obtained from dc magnetic hysteresis loops as those shown in fig.[figure5 ] ( a ) for low - intermediate temperatures . in these curves",
    "the local minimum ( maximum ) of the ascending ( descending ) branch becomes more evident on cooling .",
    "the loops occupy two field - quadrants and noticeably increase their width on cooling .",
    "this figure also indicates that the @xmath7 field is hard to detected from dc magnetic loops for temperatures higher than 33k .",
    "this is due to a technical limitation of the dc technique that lacks resolution in order to measure bulk transitions in the high - temperature regime where surface barriers dominate the magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "we therefore use the ac hysteresis loop technique in order to track the first - order transition up to higher temperatures .",
    "the ac transmittivity reflects the dimensionless normalized sustainable - current density , @xmath35 , provided @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this formula was derived for an ac penetration in the bean critical regime , an assumption that seems to be valid in view of the results presented in ref .. a low - temperature ac loop at 35k is shown in fig.[figure5 ] ( b ) depicting local minima in both , the ascending and descending branches .",
    "these minima can be ascribed to the second - peak transition @xmath7 since a minimum in @xmath32 corresponds to a maximum in the bulk @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath28 signal evolves in a different manner for the high- and intermediate - temperature regimes . for temperatures larger than @xmath37k ,",
    "the transmittivity presents paramagnetic peaks , developing at the flanks of the central depletion ( see fig.[figure2 ] ) . for intermediate temperatures a sudden jump of @xmath28 is detected , as for instance in the ac loops measured at 40 and 45k .",
    "this step - like feature , manifested at a field @xmath21 implies a frequency - independent drop of the magnetic hysteresis , consistent with the change in the width of the dc loops , and indicating that this transition is governed by the local value of @xmath17 rather than @xmath19 @xcite .",

    "therefore , the results of fig.[figure8 ] show that the previously reported absence of the @xmath7 transition for micron - sized disks of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 is the consequence of a technical limitation .",

    "the nearly - vanishing remanent magnetization and the two - quadrant locus of the dc loops in _ micron - sized _ samples indicate the preeminence of surface barriers for vortex flux entry / exit . therefore applying ac magnetic techniques",

    "is observed at almost the same field indicating the @xmath7 transition . in the vicinity of this reversal of current behavior , varying the frequency of the ac ripple field tunes a decrease ( low - frequencies ) or an increase ( high - frequencies ) of the shielding currents .",
    "the latter case is equivalent to probing magnetic relaxation on a shorter time - scale , in analogy to dc magnetization experiments @xcite , or to choosing a higher electric field in an transport @xmath49 measurement .",
    "since the @xmath49 curves just below and above the fot cross  with the electric field in the high - field phase being larger than that in the low - field phase for the low - current density limit , and vice - versa for the high - current density limit  , varying the working point ( by tuning the frequency ) leads to either a step like - behavior of the screening current ( at low electric fields ) or a peak - like curve ( at high electric fields ) @xcite .",
    "the energy barriers for flux creep have @xmath50 and @xmath51 curves with different functionalities for fields larger or smaller than the transition one . on varying field close to the transition these curves cross , and the phase transition produces a discontinuous change on the electrodynamics of vortex matter . detecting the transition with a high electric field ( short measurement times ) leads to an enhancement of shielding currents with increasing field , whereas with a low electric field ( long times )",
    "a sudden decrease is observed .",
    "the lack of sensitivity of dc magnetization loops to the fot in the intermediate - temperature regime can be understood as the consequence of a distribution of bean - livingston surface barriers @xcite .",
    "the transit of individual pancake vortices over these barriers is not affected by the nature of the vortex phase inside the sample .    the irreversibility line obtained from the onset of @xmath33 merges with the first - order transition line @xmath4 in the high - temperature regime . at lower temperatures or higher applied fields ,",
    "the shielding of the ac field starts at higher temperatures than the occurrence of the first - order transition , namely , the onset of @xmath29 develops before the paramagnetic peak on cooling .",
    "this indicates the existence of a non - linear vortex region spanning at higher temperatures than the first - order transition line @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon might have origin from a residual effect of pinning @xcite , or bean - livingston barriers @xciteon the high - temperature liquid phase .",

    "this result indicates that , independently of its nature , the first - order transition is robust and its thermodynamic nature remains unaltered even for a reduced system size of less than hundred vortices . in the low - temperature regime , the detection of the @xmath7 transition as a sudden increase of shielding currents ( decrease of @xmath28 ) persists in _ micron - sized _ samples .",
    "the observation of this feature was made possible by the use of an ac magnetic measurement technique .",
    "the possibility of working at shorter time - scales ( larger frequencies ) reveals currents flowing in the sample volume with improved sensitivity than dc measurements .",
