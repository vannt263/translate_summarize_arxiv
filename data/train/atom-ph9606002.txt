    "the investigation of macroscopic quantum phenomena is one of the prime motivations for the study of ultra - cold atomic gases .",
    "recent successful experiments on bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in trapped rubidium @xcite , lithium @xcite and sodium @xcite gave a tremendous boost to this field of research .",
    "the breakthrough leading to the achievement of bec was the implementation of evaporative cooling schemes , where cooling and thermal quasi - equilibrium are provided by interatomic elastic collisions .",
    "it is important that interaction between atoms also governs the formation kinetics of a bose condensate @xcite .",
    "a principal question with regard to quantum statistical effects concerns the possibility to reach large or even macroscopic occupation numbers for a single particle state in a collisionless bose gas , where cooling and phase - space compression proceed through interaction of atoms with light rather than through interatomic collisions .",
    "the central idea is to exploit the bosonic nature of the particles : once the occupation number of a single particle state becomes larger than unity , this enhances the rate at which the state is filled and strongly influences the population dynamics @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the gain mechanism in lasers .",
    "accordingly , the term `` atom laser '' @xcite has been coined to describe a gas far from thermal equilibrium , with atoms accumulating in a single quantum state or at least in a very small region of phase space .",
    "optical cooling of a gas in the collisionless regime requires the condition @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gas density and @xmath2 the wavelength of light . in the opposite limiting case the evolution of excited atomic states",
    "is mainly governed by interatomic collisions induced by resonance dipole interaction @xcite .",
    "these collisions proceed at a rate much larger than the rate of spontaneous emission and destroy cooling . in view of eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , to achieve occupation numbers of the order of unity or larger the atoms should gather in a momentum range smaller than the single photon recoil .",
    "cooling schemes based on dark states , such as velocity selective coherent population trapping ( vscpt ) @xcite or schemes involving raman pumping between different hyperfine states @xcite can be used for this purpose .",
    "whatever the scheme chosen , it will necessarily involve laser fields which drive the pumping , and hence spontaneous emission which , under certain conditions , can lead to compression of atoms in momentum space .",
    "reabsorption of spontaneously emitted photons , destroying the momentum - space compression , can be , hopefully , circumvented by selecting a high frequency detuning of driving light @xcite or by choosing at least one of the sample dimensions smaller than the mean free path of a photon .",
    "such geometrical means of reducing the effect of multiple reabsorption were successfully exploited in the optical cooling of atomic hydrogen @xcite and have been discussed in the context of atom lasers @xcite .",
    "exchange of longitudinal virtual photons between excited and ground - state atoms leads to resonance dipole interaction .",
    "the influence of the mean field of this interaction on vscpt cooling was found small under the condition eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) @xcite .",
    "we will consider the case where the frequency detuning @xmath3 of the laser fields from resonance with an excited state is large compared to the natural line width @xmath4 of this state . in this case resonance dipole interaction",
    "manifests itself in interatomic pair collisions ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . at interparticle distances where resonance dipole interaction compensates the frequency detuning a colliding pair is resonant with the light .",
    "this is the origin of the well known process of light absorption in pair collisions , which we will refer to as radiative collisions .",
    "of particular interest is the limit of ultra - cold collisions , reviewed in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .    at ultra - low temperatures corresponding to the @xmath5-wave scattering limit , under the condition of eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) the rate of radiative collisions is normally much smaller than the rate of absorption of light by single atoms .",
    "the situation changes drastically for atoms in so called dark states which are decoupled from the driving light field . in this case",
    "the coupling of the dark - state atoms with the driving light is induced by their radiative collisions with the atoms in coupled states .",
    "this process , unlike reabsorption of spontaneously emitted photons , can not be eliminated by arranging the sample geometry . in this paper",
    "we argue that for @xmath6 at any gas density the phase - space compression to occupation numbers larger than unity can be frustrated by this type of radiative collisions .",
    "the physical reason that these collisions can be important even in a very dilute gas is the following : if we consider a small sphere of radius @xmath7 around @xmath8 in momentum space , the filling rate of this momentum region from the gas cloud of spatial density @xmath1 is roughly proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the characteristic occupation number of momentum states in the small sphere .",
    "the collisional loss of atoms from this sphere is proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "the ratio of filling to loss rate , being large for small occupation numbers , decreases with increasing @xmath10 and tends to a constant for @xmath12 .",
    "the key point is that both the filling rate and the rate of radiative collisions depend on the degree of excitation of the atoms in a similar way .",
    "however , the phase space available for the filling is ultimately set by the momentum change in the last spontaneous emission event , i.e. the photon momentum , whereas the phase space available for collisions can be much larger . in view of this",
    "the question whether radiative collisions can prevent the occupation numbers from reaching unity is principal .",
    "we will analyze a simple general model for an atom laser which includes radiative collisions and apply the results to vscpt cooling on a j=1 to j=1 transition , successfully used to cool helium atoms in the metastable @xmath13 state to below the recoil energy @xcite .",
    "for this scheme we discuss both the case of large positive and large negative detuning and show that the latter case is more promising for realizing an atom laser .",
    "we consider a general scheme for an atom laser , such as presented in ref .",
    "this scheme is depicted in fig .  [ 1 ] .",
    "all atoms are confined to a volume much larger than the optical wavelength and such that the eigenstates of the translational motion of the atoms are ( approximate ) momentum eigenstates .",
    "we have two sets of atomic states called the system ( labeled @xmath5 ) and bath ( labeled @xmath14 ) .",
    "the system @xmath5 comprises just the atoms in the compressed momentum space described above .",
    "the laser fields are tuned close to a resonance involving an excited atomic state @xmath15 , which optically pumps the atoms from the bath into the system . in fig .  [ 1 ] the pumping scheme is schematically represented as a single transition connecting the bath states to the excited state followed by spontaneous emission into the system states , although in practice the pumping scheme can be more complicated .",
    "spontaneous emission makes the atom end up in a system state with momentum @xmath16 , chosen so to say `` by chance '' as a result of the random direction of the emitted photon . as the focus of this paper is the role of radiative collisions with bath atoms , we omit all other potential loss mechanisms ( in contrast to e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) such as decay of the system states due to absorption of spontaneously emitted photons .",
    "then the rate equation for the occupation numbers @xmath17 of the system states with momentum @xmath16 takes the form : @xmath18 the first term denotes the loss rate of isolated atoms in the system due to the presence of the light fields .",
    "it involves optical pumping from the system states back into the bath .",
    "clearly it is advantageous if the lifetime of systems states increases with decreasing momentum .",
    "we will assume that this repumping rate vanishes quadratically with momentum for small @xmath19 : @xmath20 .",
    "such a quadratic dependence is a naturally encountered in schemes based on vscpt or on velocity selective raman pumping .",
    "the region @xmath21 can be called a trap in momentum space . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) is the pumping rate from bath states into the system . here",
    "@xmath22 is the probability per unit time that an atom leaves the bath state having momentum @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the occupation number of the corresponding bath state , and @xmath25 is the probability density for a bath atom with momentum @xmath23 to end up in a system state with momentum @xmath16 after a spontaneous emission event .",
    "the prefactor @xmath26 in the second term is the bose enhancement factor which is responsible for the `` lasing '' process . the third term in eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) is the focus of this paper .",
    "it describes the absorption and subsequent reemission of a photon from the laser fields in a collision between the system atom and the bath atom .",
    "as the photon absorption strongly changes the relative motion of colliding atoms , such radiative collisions will be a loss mechanism for system atoms trapped in the space of low momenta @xmath27 . for large frequency detuning",
    "@xmath3 the rate constant of radiative collisions @xmath28 becomes momentum independent and can be written as @xmath29 . the cubic dependence on @xmath30 , and the proportionality to @xmath31 are a consequence of the resonant dipole interaction .",
    "the coefficient @xmath32 depends on @xmath3 , the rabi frequency and details of the level structure .    in view of eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) it is natural to assume that the momentum trap size @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the photon momentum . in order to simplify the picture",
    "we describe the bath by introducing a sphere @xmath35 in momentum space , with the bath occupation numbers independent of @xmath16 for @xmath36 and zero otherwise .",
    "also @xmath37 is momentum independent .",

    "( [ evolution ] ) can be written as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a numerical coefficient which depends on the cooling scheme and the level structure of the atoms . with @xmath46 ,",

    "it is smaller than unity unless @xmath50 is very close to 1 .",
    "the fraction of particles accumulated in the momentum - space trap is of the order of @xmath59 , hence for @xmath56 the atoms predominantly remain in bath states .    in the case",
    "@xmath60 there is no steady state solution .",
    "the occupation numbers of states with @xmath61 grow exponentially , with a characteristic inverse growth time @xmath62 .",
    "we have an atom laser .",
    "there is no threshold due to the fact that we omitted all loss mechanisms except radiative collisions .",
    "ultimately the bath will be depleted and the above approximations break down .",
    "clearly , two criteria have to be met in order to make the atom laser work : in order to have @xmath60 the prefactor @xmath32 which governs radiative collisions should be much smaller than @xmath45 and the bath temperature should be kept as close to @xmath63 as possible .",
    "we will apply the general scheme for the atom laser described above to the case of vscpt cooing of he in the metastable @xmath65 state ( he@xmath64 ) in fig .  [ 2 ] we show the relevant levels involved in vscpt cooling of he@xmath64 . for simplicity",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "light absorption in pair interatomic collisions requires at least one of the colliding atoms to be in a coupled state , since for a pair of atoms both in uncoupled states the resonance dipole interaction is practically absent .",
    "therefore , the collisional loss term for the system atoms in eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) will be proportional to the occupation number @xmath98 of the coupled states with momenta around @xmath34 .",
    "we defined our bath as containing both coupled and uncoupled states , but only the coupled part contributes to the radiative collisions .",
    "except for very small momenta , the time scale on which the populations change is long compared to the optical pumping time , therefore detailed balance ensures that the ratio of the occupation numbers of coupled and uncoupled states satisfies the condition @xmath99 hence , as @xmath100 for @xmath93 , we can express the decay of @xmath101 in terms of the bath occupation numbers by substituting @xmath102 .",

( [ detailed ] ) ) . as only the population of the coupled states contributes to the collisional loss of system atoms , the rate of radiative collisions involving coupled - state atoms with momentum @xmath108 is reduced by a factor @xmath109 compared to the case @xmath43 .",

    "we obtain the decay rate of the occupation number of system atoms with momentum @xmath16 due to pair radiative collisions with bath atoms in uncoupled states .",
    "as those represent only a part of the bath , the above defined effective rate constant of radiative collisions @xmath154 ( and parameter @xmath32 ) are proportional to the ratio @xmath155 .",

    "it has been shown @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) that for a @xmath161 to @xmath161 transition there always exists an uncoupled state with @xmath162 .",

    "similarly , the result of the calculation presented above for the rate of radiative collisions caries over without change : we should only replace @xmath151 in eq .",

    "we have shown that the operating conditions for an atom laser based on vscpt of he@xmath213 are strongly limited by the loss mechanism associated with radiative collisions . for positive detuning",
    "it is necessary to precool the gas very close to the recoil energy . for negative detuning",
    "the situation is more favorable but the lack of sub - doppler cooling in vscpt schemes for negative @xmath3 may offset this advantage .",
    "we have shown that it is not fundamentally impossible to realize the operating conditions for an atom laser using vscpt but in practice it may be rather difficult . clearly all other loss mechanisms should be carefully eliminated .",
    "although we did not analyse in detail other atom laser schemes , we believe that in general it is crucial to take the effect of radiative collisions into account when considering these models .",
