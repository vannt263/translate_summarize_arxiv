    "inflation is the most popular scenario of the extremely early universe @xcite . in addition to elegantly solving the flatness puzzles , the horizon puzzles , and the monopole puzzles in the hot big bang universe , inflationary models predict the primordial density fluctuations ( scalar perturbations ) with the nearly gaussian distribution , and the nearly scale - invariant power spectrum @xcite , which have been strongly supported by the recent observations on the anisotropies of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite , and the distributions of the galaxies in various large - scale structure observations .    in the inflation scenario ,",
    "a stochastic background of relic ( primordial ) gravitational waves ( rgws ) in full frequency range was inevitable produced due to the superadiabatic amplification of zero - point quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field @xcite , which provides the unique window to study the physics in the early universe before the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) stage .",
    "nowadays , the detection of rgws in different frequencies has been carried out by different methods . in the lowest frequency range with @xmath5hz , it can be detected by their imprints in the cmb anisotropies in temperature and polarizations @xcite .",
    "the recent planck observations on the cmb temperature and e - mode polarizations give the tightest constraint on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath6 @xcite , which is consistent with the result @xmath7 obtained from the joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck b - mode polarization data @xcite . in the near future , one anticipates that the detection limit can arrive at @xmath8 for various ground - based or balloon - borne experiments ( including keck / bicep3 , polarbear , spt-3 g , actpol , class , qubic , quijote , quiet , simons array , ebex , piper , spider et al . ) .",
    "while for the space - based missions , such as cmbpol , litebird , core , prism , pixie , the detection limit can be @xmath9 @xcite .    in the high frequency range , i.e. @xmath10hz , rgws are detected by the ground - based and space - based laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatories .",
    "so far the most stringent bound is obtained by the joint analysis of the 2009 - 2010 ligo and virgo data , which gives energy density of rgws @xmath11 at frequency band spanning 41.5 - 1726hz @xcite . in the future , the detection limits at @xmath12hz are expected to be @xmath13 for the second - generation gravitational - wave detectors , such as advligo , advvirgo , kagra and so on @xcite . for the third - generation detectors , such as einstein telescope , this limit could arrive at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the space - based detectors are sensitive to the lower - frequency gravitational wave ( about 0.1 mhz to 1 hz ) . for the future elisa / ngo mission , the detection ability is hopeful to be @xmath15 at @xmath16 mhz @xcite .",
    "in addition , the limit can be even improved by 5 - 10 orders by bbo @xcite , decigo @xcite and astrod @xcite in the far future .    in this paper",
    ", we shall focus on the rgws in the median frequency range . in the frequency band @xmath17hz",
    ", the gravitational waves are probed through the pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) .",
    "it is well known that , the millisecond pulsars are the very stable clocks .",
    "the tiny timing residuals of these pulsars are caused by some intrinsic or environmental noises , as well as gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "it was realized that the timing residuals from an array of pulsars could be analyzed coherently to separate gw - induced residuals from other effects @xcite .",
    "so , it provides the excellent way to detect rgws in the median frequency range .",
    "nowadays , these observations are carried out by three groups ( ppta , epta , nanograv ) .",
    "recently , all teams released their latest timing results @xcite , and the tightest constraint is obtained by the ppta team , they placed a @xmath18 upper limit on the strain amplitude ( at a frequency of yr@xmath19 ) in the power - law model of @xmath20 for spectral index @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "these bounds could be significantly improved by the potential observations of future international pulsar timing array ( ipta ) , five - hundred - meter aperture spherical radio telescope ( fast ) in china and the planned square kilometer array ( ska ) projects @xcite .",
    "these upper limits of gw background have also been applied to constrain the rgws and on the inflation physics @xcite . in all these previous works ,",
    "a simple evolution model is used to calculate the rgw power spectrum , where the effects of free - streaming fluids and various cosmic phase transitions are neglected .",
    "however , it was known that , the relativistic free - streaming gas ( such as the neutrinos in the universe ) gives rise to an anisotropic term in the evolution equation of gravitational waves , which can significantly damp the rgw spectra at @xmath22hz @xcite .",
    "another effect is caused by the successive changes in the relativistic degrees of freedom during the radiation - dominant stage , i.e. the qcd transition , @xmath23 annihilation , the electroweak phase transition and so on . during these transitions ,",
    "the evolution of scale factor was altered compared with the standard radiation - dominant stage , which left the imprints in the rgw spectrum at @xmath24hz @xcite .",
    "so , both effects can change the rgws at the median frequency range . in this paper , we shall investigate in details the effects of free - steaming gas and cosmic phase transitions on the rgw spectrum in a general cosmological scenario . in particular , we shall focus on their influences on the detection of rgws by the current and future ptas and the corresponding cosmological implications .",

    "now all the effects of evolution in the post - inflation stage are attributed to the transfer function and we split the transfer function into several parts to account for different damping factors @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 represents the transfer function of the cosmic expansion ( the reason of cosmological redshift @xmath69 ) , while @xmath70 is for cosmic phase transitions in hot universe , @xmath71 is for free - streaming particles(e.g .",

    "now we would like to discuss the transfer functions one by one .",
    "rgws were stretched out of the horizon during the inflationary epoch and re - entered the horizon in the following epochs of decelerating expansion and recent accelerating expansion @xcite .    when stretched out of the horizon ,",
    "rgws started to freeze out and the amplitude kept constant , because out of the horizon there are no anisotropic tensor to damp the rgws even when there are some particles whose free path may be comparable to the horizon @xcite . when the universe exited inflation , the horizon started to increase and the modes with high @xmath35 ( thus short wavelength ) started to re - enter the horizon .",
    "the criterion of horizon crossing is @xmath75 @xcite . after re - entering the horizon ,",
    "rgws are mainly damped by the expansion of the universe . according to ( [ equation_of_evolution ] ) ,",
    "when the anisotropic term @xmath32 is neglected , the amplitude of modes in the inner part of the horizon ( @xmath76 ) would satisfy @xmath77 so the evolution of rgws is closely related to the history of expansion .",
    "turner et al @xcite formulated the transfer function in the decelerating expansion by fitting it to the numerically integrated results , while zhang et al noticed the effect of accelerating expansion @xcite .",
    "now the transfer function in the expanding universe is the product of @xmath78 ( radiation and matter dominated era ) and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 dominated era ) , or precisely @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 mpc@xmath19 is the wavenumber corresponding to the mode that entered the horizon at the equality of matter and radiation , and @xmath83 is the spherical bessel function of the first kind .    in fig .",

    "when the hot universe gradually cooled down in the radiation - dominant era , massive particles became less relativistic and contributed less to the energy density of radiation .",
    "typical cases are the breaking of supersymmetry ( susy ) and the combination of quarks into hadrons ( phase transition of quantum chromodynamics i.e. qcd phase transition ) .",
    "besides that , the annihilation of electrons and positrons also induced big change in the energy density of radiation . here , we generally call all these three effects and similar effects that could induce the change of energy density of radiation cosmic phase transition .",
    "the cosmic phase transitions change the energy density of radiation thus the hubble parameter @xmath85 , and affect the amplitude of rgws through eq .",

    "the transfer function of phase transitions is @xcite    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is effective degree of freedom ( here effective degree of freedom is obtained by converting all particles into effective photons , see chapter 3.3 in @xcite ) for total energy density and @xmath88 is the effective degree of freedom for entropy density at temperature @xmath89 , while @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the present values .",

    "we can further convert wavenumber into frequency : @xmath98 .",
    "the transfer function of phase transitions depends on not only the temperature but also the physical characteristics of particles , such as mass , degree of freedom and the statistical features ( bosons or fermions ) and so on .",
    "we follow the list of particles in @xcite but update the data according to @xcite .",
    "the temperature when particles decouple from the others is also very important .",
    "here we adopt instantaneous decoupling of neutrinos from the radiation at @xmath99 mev , and that electrons annihilate with positrons immediately at @xmath100 mev @xcite .",

    "when neutrinos decouple from the rest of radiation , the free streaming of neutrinos contributes to the anisotropic stress @xmath112 , which plays the role of friction in the equation of motion and damps the amplitude of rgws , so it is necessary to study the damping effect of neutrinos .    in very high precision ,",

    "when @xmath35 decreases and becomes comparable with @xmath116 , this formula does not apply any more .",

    "detections of rgws have been carried on by different experimental methods . in the median frequency range",
    "@xmath217 hz , the detection is by analyzing the timing residual of the millisecond pulsars .",
    "recently , all three pta groups ( ppta , epta and nanograv ) reported the latest constraints on the gw background .",
    "in this paper , by considering the current and the potential future pta observations , we investigated the constraints on the rgws and the inflationary parameters in the general cosmological scenario .",
    "in particular , we studied the effects of cosmic phase transitions and various relativistic free - streaming fluids , which had been neglected in all the previous works .",
    "cosmic phase transitions , including @xmath0 annihilation , qcd transition and susy breaking , damp the rgw spectrum in the frequency range @xmath24hz , which is exactly the sensitivity range of pta method . taking into account the damping effects caused by all physical transitions , we find the upper limit of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath1 increases by a factor @xmath2 for any given spectral index @xmath84 . in the standard cosmological scenario , for current nanograv constraints with @xmath218 , the upper limit of @xmath1 increases from @xmath219 to @xmath220 . while , for the future ska(100 ) , if @xmath172 , we find the detection of rgws is possible only if @xmath221 , instead of @xmath222 .    the relativistic free - streaming gases , including neutrinos and some unknown dark fluids in the universe , influenced the evolution of rgws in the radiation - dominant stage , which significantly damped the rgws spectrum at the frequency range @xmath22hz . by analysis",
    ", we find this effect is very small in frequency @xmath217 hz for both neutrinos and dark fluids . even for the future ska(100 ) project",
    ", this effect seems impossible to be detected .    in the general cosmological scenario ,",
    "the effective eos @xmath3 of the cosmic fluid can be different from @xmath4 in the pre - bbn stage .",
    "we find that , the value of @xmath3 greatly affects the rgws spectrum , as well as their detection by pulsar timing arrays .",
    "for the future ska(100 ) project , if @xmath8 is set , we find the detection is possible if @xmath223 for the standard model with @xmath224 . however , if @xmath206 , they can be detected only if @xmath225 .",
    "so , the stiff eos could significantly decreases the difficulties of rgw detection .    at the end of this paper",
    ", we should mention that in addition to the detection methods above , rgws have also been constrained by some other observational and experimental efforts . in the frequency range @xmath226hz ,",
    "gw background produces a pattern of apparent proper motion of quasars .",
    "so , by observing the motion of quasars in the universe , an interesting constraint @xmath227 in this frequency band is given in @xcite .",
    "for the rgws with high frequency @xmath228 hz , by analyzing the implications of graviton to photon conversion in the presence of large - scale magnetic fields , an upper limit @xmath229 is derived in @xcite . meanwhile , the experimental detections of the rgws by various gw detectors ( e.g. the cryogenic resonant bar detectors @xcite , the cavity detectors mago@xcite , the waveguide detectors @xcite , the gaussian maser beam detectors @xcite ) have also been well studied in the recent literatures .",
