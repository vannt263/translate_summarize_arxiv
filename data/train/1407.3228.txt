    "one natural generalization is to alleviate the exclusion constraint by allowing @xmath4 particles per site ( @xmath5 is a fixed integer ) . more precisely , this process is defined in @xmath6 dimensions , say on the hyper - cubic lattice @xmath7 , as follows : ( i ) each particle attempts to hop to its @xmath8 neighbors with the same unit rate to each neighbor ( symmetric hopping ) , ( ii ) every hopping attempt is successful when the target site is occupied by less than @xmath4 particles , otherwise the hopping attempt is rejected ( fig .",

    "the average density varies on the scales greatly exceeding the lattice spacing .",
    "therefore we write @xmath58 ; the notation @xmath59 emphasizes that we are switching to the continuum description .",

    "these are lattice gas models in which the current @xmath71 of particles moving from any site @xmath13 to @xmath54 can be written as a discrete gradient .",

    "the idea is to ignore correlations .",
    "this is true in the equilibrium . in the evolving state ,",
    "the presence of local density gradients induces long - ranged correlations , but in numerous lattice gases these correlations vanish to first order in the density difference .",
    "this has been rigorously established ( in all spatial dimensions ) for lattice gases with hard - core exclusion @xcite , and it is expected to apply to a much larger class of models",
    ". there can be appreciable correlations in the earlier time regime , but we are interested in the hydrodynamic limit which , by definition , describes the evolution close to equilibrium .",
    "the vanishing of correlations in the first order in the density gradient implies that in the hydrodynamic regime our perturbative treatment leads to exact predictions for the diffusion coefficient .    to appreciate the validity of a perturbative approach it is useful to compare the situation with kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "recall that the boltzmann equation , even though it is mean - field in nature ( as it is based on the assumption of molecular chaos ) , is asymptotically exact in the hydrodynamic regime , so the emerging transport coefficients are exact . in the context of kinetic theory",
    "the main challenge is technical  even for dilute monoatomic gases ( e.g. , for hard spheres gas ) , it has not been possible to _ extract _ transport coefficients analytically @xcite .",
    "lattice gases are much more tractable , so even for dense lattice gases the computing of the diffusion coefficient is occasionally feasible .",
    "the crucial ingredient is the understanding of the equilibrium state .",
    "we emphasize that for lattice gases of gradient type ( e.g. , for the katz - lebowitz - spohn model with symmetric hopping @xcite and for repulsion processes @xcite ) when computations using a green - kubo formula become feasible , the results for the diffusion coefficient _ agree _ with predictions derived using the perturbative approach .",
    "further , for lattice gases of non - gradient type whenever it was possible to apply the perturbative approach ( see @xcite ) , the predictions for the diffusion coefficient were again exact as it was evidenced through rigorous analyses , mappings to gradient type lattice gases , and comparisons with simulations .      to implement the perturbative approach for the gep with @xmath65 on the one - dimensional lattice , we first replace by @xmath74 \\langle f(n_j)\\rangle \\\\ & - \\langle n_j\\rangle   [ \\langle f(n_{j-1 } ) \\rangle + \\langle f(n_{j+1})\\rangle ] .",

    "because the mean - field prediction becomes exact when @xmath208 .",

    "we investigated generalized exclusion processes with symmetric nearest - neighbor hopping parametrized by an integer @xmath4 , the maximal occupancy .",
    "specifically , we studied a class of such processes interpolating between the symmetric exclusion process ( @xmath1 ) and non - interacting random walkers ( @xmath2 ) . for these lattice gases",
    "the hydrodynamic behavior is governed by a diffusion equation .",
    "we computed the diffusion coefficient @xmath27 and showed that for every @xmath4 , it does not depend on the spatial dimension , but it does depend on @xmath4 .",
    "we showed that , apart from the extreme cases of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the diffusion coefficient depends on the density .",
    "we studied numerically the self - diffusion phenomenon for the geps in one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "an interesting challenge is to compute the self - diffusion coefficient for the geps with @xmath172 in one dimension . in two and higher dimensions",
    "this problem seems intractable , even for the sep in two dimensions the coefficient of self - diffusion is unknown ; it has only been established that @xmath212 is a smooth function of the density @xcite . in the one - dimensional setting ,",
    "the tagged particle in the case of the sep undergoes an anomalously slow sub - diffusive behavior which is well understood , and even large deviations of the displacement of the tagged particle have been probed ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . therefore there is a hope that the self - diffusion phenomenon in the one - dimensional gep is also analytically tractable .",

    "the problem is that in the driven case the structure of the steady states is unknown : it is not a product measure anymore , even on a ring @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to modify the rules of the gep to make the structure of the steady states more accessible .",
    "an interesting variant is to employ a drop - push dynamics when a hopping attempt to a fully occupied neighboring site is not rejected , but instead the particle proceeds in the same direction and lands at the closest site which is not fully occupied @xcite ; a similar process was suggested , and studied for @xmath1 , in the context of self - organized criticality @xcite . for these geps with drop - push dynamics",
    "the structure of the steady states is known in the general case of asymmetric hopping @xcite .",
