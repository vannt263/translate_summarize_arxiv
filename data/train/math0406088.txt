    "in @xcite paoluzzi constructed a family @xmath0 of compact orientable three - dimensional manifolds with boundary , indexed by integers @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "though the construction is closely related to the three - dimensional torus @xmath5 , one of the typical non - hyperbolic manifolds ( and @xmath6 is indeed , by definition , @xmath5 minus a small open ball ) , most of them are shown to admit a hyperbolic structure with totally geodesic boundary .",
    "the key property for the construction is the symmetry of @xmath5 of order three induced by the diagonal of the cube as its fundamental polyhedron .",
    "it should be noted that a similar construction appears to give hyperbolic spatial graphs from torus knots in the three sphere ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting property of @xmath7 is that its fundamental group has cyclic presentation .",
    "a group is said to have _ cyclic presentation _ if it is isomorphic to @xmath8 for some @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a word in the free group @xmath12 and @xmath10 is the automorphism of @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 for all @xmath15 , where all indices are considered modulo @xmath1 .",
    "it has already been shown in @xcite that it is impossible to find an algorithmic solution to whether or not a finite presentation of a group is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a three - dimensional manifold .",
    "furthermore , cyclically presented groups contain well - known and well studied groups such as fibonacci groups and sieradski groups , which it is known can be regarded as fundamental groups of some three - dimensional hyperbolic manifolds ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein for related topics ) .",
    "so it is worthwhile ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to investigate three - dimensional hyperbolic manifolds whose fundamental groups are isomorphic to some other cyclically presented groups , and @xmath7 is indeed such a manifold .",
    "we here recall a combinatorial definition of the manifold @xmath7 given in @xcite . for a positive integer @xmath1 ,",
    "let @xmath16 be a dual polyhedron of a regular @xmath1-gonal anti - prism ( see figure  [ fig_cpol ] ) ; it is obtained by taking the quotient of a cube by the rotation of order three about its diagonal , and then taking the branched covering of the  @xmath17-cube \" along the image of the diagonal of order @xmath1 .",
    "so its boundary consists of @xmath18 quadrilateral faces .",
    "we could say that @xmath16 is a natural generalization of a cube .",
    "indeed , it plays a key role in _",
    "generalized cubing _ of three - dimensional manifolds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we then denote by @xmath19 the polyhedron obtained by truncating the neighborhoods of all vertices of @xmath16 in such a small way that the faces obtained by the truncation do not intersect each other ( see figure  [ fig_cpol ] again ) .",
    "we call a face of @xmath19 obtained by a truncation _ external _ ( _ internal _ otherwise ) .",
    "similarly we call an edge surrounding an external face _ external _ ( _ internal _ otherwise ) .     and @xmath20,width=188 ]",
    "we next give an identification rule among the internal faces of @xmath19 .",
    "figure  [ fig_idrule ] shows the boundary of @xmath16 flattened out on the plane , where the top ( resp .",
    "bottom ) cone point is at positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) infinity .",
    "so we can imagine that the solid occupies the half - space behind the page .",
    "we fix an integer @xmath2 with @xmath4 .",
    "then , for each integer @xmath21 with @xmath22 , we identify the face @xmath23 with the face @xmath24 in this order , where indices are always considered modulo @xmath1 .",
    "we call this identification rule the _ identification rule of step @xmath2_. we here note that , when @xmath25 , @xmath26 is simply a cube , and then the identification rule of step @xmath27 gives the three - dimensional torus @xmath5 .",
    "this identification rule naturally induces the one among the internal faces of @xmath19 , and we denote a topological manifold of this quotient space by @xmath7 .    , width=377 ]    it should be noted that there are two different behaviors of @xmath7 depending on @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath28 modulo @xmath29 , all internal edges of @xmath19 are glued together , and @xmath30 is an orientable surface of genus @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath32 modulo @xmath29 , the internal edges are identified in three groups of @xmath33 each , and @xmath30 is an orientable surface of genus @xmath34 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that each @xmath7 is a cyclic branched covering of @xmath35 along two arcs , and that it admits a hyperbolic structure with totally geodesic boundary when @xmath36 , except @xmath37 , and any @xmath2 with @xmath4 .",
    "she also determined their fundamental groups and the first homology groups , and using them she obtained a sufficient condition for two manifolds to be isometric .",
    "indeed she proved that @xmath7 and @xmath38 are isometric if @xmath39 and @xmath40 or @xmath41 . in this paper",
    ", we complete her results . namely we prove the following theorem , which improves her results to say that @xmath7 admits a hyperbolic structure even when @xmath42 , and that her sufficient condition is enough to classify the manifolds .",
    "we also obtain their isometry groups as a by - product of the classification . the key tool for the proof is the canonical decomposition of @xmath7 , which will be explained in the proof given in the next section .    [ it_str ]",

    "the outline of this part is as same as of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.1 ) , and we omit basic results about hyperbolic geometry .",
    "let @xmath70 be an affine hyperplane in the four - dimensional minkowsky space @xmath71 .",
    "we regard @xmath72 as @xmath73 , and we also regard the open unit ball , say @xmath74 , centred at the origin as the projective ball model of three - dimensional hyperbolic space , in the usual way .",
    "that is , the radial projection from @xmath75 , the so - called hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic space .",
    "then @xmath76 , which corresponds to the set of half - spaces in the hyperbolic space , projects to the exterior of the closed unit sphere @xmath77 .",
    "suppose @xmath78 is a euclidean symmetric polyhedron which is put in the centre of @xmath72 as in figure  [ fig_cpol ] .",
    "since we are to construct the fundamental polyhedra of the hyperbolic manifolds , we can also assume that @xmath78 is symmetric and its centre coincides with the origin of @xmath72 , and we focus on a fundamental tetrahedron , say @xmath79 , with respect to this symmetry ( see figure  [ fig_piece ] ) .",
    "let @xmath80 ( resp .",
    "@xmath81 ) be the top ( resp .",
    "bottom ) cone point , and let @xmath82 ( resp .",
    "@xmath83 ) be the terminal point of the edge @xmath69 ( resp .",
    "@xmath67 ) opposite to @xmath80 ( resp .",
    "@xmath81 ) .",
    "these vertices are poles of truncation planes , so they must lie outside of @xmath77 .",
    "we denote by @xmath84 their lifts to @xmath85 .",
    "now the coordinates of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be expressed by @xmath90 , @xmath60 and @xmath10 as follows : @xmath91 here @xmath90 ( resp .",
    "@xmath60 ) is the euclidean distance between @xmath80 ( resp .",
    "@xmath82 ) and the origin , @xmath10 is the euclidean angle between the @xmath92-axis and the segment joining @xmath82 and the origin , and @xmath93 is a @xmath94 matrix defined as follows : @xmath95 let @xmath96 be the outward unit normal vector to the plane spanned by @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath87 .",
    "then its coordinate is : @xmath97 where @xmath98",
    ". then @xmath99 is the outward unit normal vector to the plane spanned by @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .    by the definition of @xmath16 ,",
    "the four vertices @xmath80 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath103 must be in the same plane .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath104 .",
    "thus we obtain the following relation : @xmath105    for isometric gluing , the hyperbolic lengths of the edges obtained from @xmath69 and @xmath65 by truncation must be equal .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath106 , and we thus obtain the following relation : @xmath107    let @xmath108 ( resp .",
    "@xmath109 ) be the outward unit normal vector to the plane spanned by @xmath86 , @xmath88 and @xmath87 ( resp .",
    "@xmath86 , @xmath89 and @xmath87 ) . then @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "now the dihedral angles of @xmath112 can be calculated by using @xmath113 , @xmath96 and @xmath108 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath114 ( resp .",
    "@xmath115 ) the dihedral angle between polar planes of @xmath113 and @xmath108 ( resp .",
    "@xmath113 and @xmath96 ) , then @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "since the dihedral angles of edges glued together must sum up to @xmath118 , we have the third condition on the parameters @xmath90 , @xmath60 and @xmath10 via a relation with respect to @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "since there are two kinds of gluing patterns , as mentioned in the middle of the introduction , the condition separates into two cases .",
    "we first consider the case where @xmath28 modulo @xmath29 . in this case",
    "all internal edges are identified together with one edge .",
    "so we obtain the condition @xmath119 .",
    "by straightforward calculation , it is equivalent to the following one : @xmath120 now we can easily check that , when @xmath36 with @xmath28 modulo @xmath29 , @xmath121 and the truncation planes are ultraparallel .",
    "thus we have obtained a suitable realization of @xmath19 as a hyperbolic polyhedron in this case .",
    "we next consider the case where @xmath32 modulo @xmath29 . in this case",
    "the internal edges are identified in three groups of @xmath33 each .",
    "so we obtain the condition @xmath122 . in the same fashion as above",
    ", we have @xmath123 and we can see that this also gives a suitable realization of @xmath19 .    finally by poincar s theorem on fundamental polyhedra ( see @xcite ) , we can say that the hyperbolic polyhedron @xmath124 is a fundamental polyhedron of @xmath7 when @xmath36 .",
    "thus has been proved .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath125 admits a hyperbolic structure , though paoluzzi did not mention it in @xcite .",
    "for the proof of and , we use the _ canonical decomposition _ of @xmath7 . for details about the canonical decomposition of compact hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundary , see @xcite .",
    "two remarkable applications about the canonical decomposition are : ( i ) two hyperbolic manifolds are homeomorphic ( or equivalently , by mostow s rigidity theorem , isometric ) if and only if their canonical decompositions are equivalent , that is , they are decomposed into same pieces , and the identification rule is also the same ; ( ii ) all combinatorial automorphisms of the canonical decomposition form the isometry group of the manifold .",
    "so , to prove and , we need to determine the canonical decomposition of @xmath7 , and the result is as follows :    the canonical decomposition @xmath126 of @xmath7 , where @xmath36 and @xmath4 , consists of @xmath18 truncated tetrahedra obtained by cutting @xmath19 into pieces like segments of an orange ( as in figure  [ fig_sym ] ) .",
    "if the candidate decomposition consists of truncated tetrahedra then , by the definition of the canonical decomposition , checking that all the tilts are negative is enough to show that the decomposition is canonical ( see @xcite for the definition of the tilts of truncated polyhedra ) . by symmetry of @xmath19 ,",
    "all we have to show is that all the tilts of the truncated tetrahedron @xmath112 are negative ( see figure  [ fig_piece ] again ) .",
    "let @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 be the tilts of internal faces of @xmath112 whose normal vectors are @xmath113 , @xmath96 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 respectively .",
    "then , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.3 ) , the following equation holds : @xmath131 by straightforward calculation , we have @xmath132 where @xmath133 since @xmath36 , we have @xmath134",
    ". thus we obtain @xmath135 for any @xmath36 , thereby proving the lemma .",
    "one of the most remarkable characteristics of the canonical decomposition is that the decomposition is invariant under the action of the isometry group of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath136 be the combinatorial automorphism group of the canonical decomposition @xmath126 of @xmath7 . by mostow s rigidity theorem together with the characteristic of the canonical decomposition mentioned above",
    ", the isometry group @xmath137 of @xmath7 is isomorphic to @xmath136 .",
    "thus , for the study of @xmath137 , it is enough to investigate @xmath136 .",
    "since this group is determined from the combinatorial data of @xmath126 , we focus on the ( untruncated ) tetrahedral decomposition , say @xmath138 , of @xmath16 induced by the canonical decomposition of @xmath7 with the identification rule of step @xmath2 defined in the introduction , and its combinatorial isomorphisms ( see figure  [ fig_cdp ] ) .",
    "let @xmath140 be such an isomorphism .",
    "then there are two possibilities ; the first is that @xmath140 is indeed a combinatorial automorphism of @xmath126 . in this case",
    "@xmath140 is an element of @xmath136 , and so is an element of @xmath137 .",
    "the second is that @xmath140 is not a combinatorial automorphism of @xmath126 , but @xmath141 becomes @xmath142 for some @xmath143 . in this case",
    "@xmath140 induces an isometry between @xmath7 and @xmath144 .",
    "we will find all isomorphisms of the first case , and these form all of @xmath136 , which finishes the proof of .",
    "we will find all isomorphisms of the second case , and this gives us all isometries @xmath145 , which finishes the proof of .",
    "so our task is to find all @xmath140 s of the first and second cases .",
    "we name pieces and edges of @xmath138 as follows : a piece including @xmath146 ( resp .",
    "@xmath147 ) is named @xmath148 ( resp .",
    "@xmath149 ) . in a piece @xmath150 ,",
    "the vertex obtained from @xmath80 ( resp .",
    "@xmath81 ) is named @xmath151 ( resp .",
    "@xmath152 ) , and the terminal point of @xmath153 ( resp .",
    "@xmath154 ) other than @xmath151 ( resp .",
    "@xmath152 ) is named @xmath155 ( resp .",
    "@xmath156 ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig_cdp ] again .",
    "we denote by @xmath157 the edge in the piece @xmath150 joining vertices @xmath151 and @xmath152 , and by @xmath158 the arc in @xmath7 ( or the quotient space of @xmath16 ) obtained from gluing all @xmath157 s .",
    "let @xmath159 be the dihedral group of order @xmath18 generated by @xmath60 and @xmath63 ( see figure  [ fig_sym ] again ) ; @xmath160 .",
    "then we can easily see that , for all @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath159 is a subgroup of @xmath136 .",
    "so , without loss of generality , we only consider isomorphisms mapping @xmath161 to one of @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "since pieces of @xmath138 are not regular tetrahedra , there are just the following eight possibilities for such isomorphisms : @xmath165 the isomorphism @xmath166 induces the identity of @xmath136 , and it is easy to see that @xmath167 .",
    "so @xmath168 if @xmath169 and @xmath170 or @xmath171 .",
    "furthermore @xmath172 if and only if @xmath173 , i.e. , @xmath1 is odd and @xmath47 .      in this case , as we saw in the introduction , all internal edges of @xmath19 are glued together .",
    "so the arc in @xmath7 obtained from the internal edges of @xmath19 is surrounded by @xmath175 wedges . on the other hand ,",
    "the arc @xmath158 in @xmath7 is surrounded by @xmath18 wedges .",
    "thus any isomorphism must maps @xmath176 to @xmath157 , which means that @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 are not combinatorial isomorphisms of @xmath138 .",
    "we first suppose that @xmath1 is odd and @xmath183 .",
    "then @xmath184 and we have the following short exact sequence : @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the inclusion , and @xmath187 is the homomorphism defined as follows : for any @xmath188 , @xmath189 let @xmath66 be @xmath190 , then @xmath191 is presented as @xmath192 and is a subgroup of @xmath136 .",
    "so the sequence above splits .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath136 as follows : @xmath193 we here note that @xmath194 .        in this case , as mentioned in the introduction , the internal edges of @xmath19 are identified in three groups of @xmath33 each .",
    "we denote by @xmath199 ( resp .",
    "@xmath200 , @xmath201 ) the arc in @xmath7 ( or the quotient space of @xmath16 ) including @xmath69 ( resp .",
    "@xmath202 , @xmath203 ) .",
    "this case is separated into two subcases .",
    "though the arcs @xmath158 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 are surrounded by @xmath18 wedges , @xmath158 is done by @xmath18 different pieces , while each of @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 is done by @xmath205 different ones .",
    "so , in the same fashion as case 1 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 are not combinatorial isomorphisms of @xmath138 .",
    "furthermore , there is no pair @xmath43 satisfying @xmath32 and @xmath49 together with @xmath1 is odd and @xmath47 .",
    "this means that @xmath206 , and thus we have @xmath197 .",
    "we first show that @xmath209 .",
    "a part of the side face of @xmath210 looks as shown in figure  [ fig_phi21 ] . since @xmath51 ,",
    "the identification rule of step @xmath2 in terms of @xmath138 induces the one in terms of @xmath210 .",
    "thus we have @xmath209 .",
    "now we have the following equalities : @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 .",
    "so all the possibilities for @xmath216 are nothing but @xmath126 or @xmath217 .",
    "thus we have proved , i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath38 are isometric if and only if @xmath39 and @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "to finish the proof in this case , we first consider the case where @xmath1 is even or @xmath195 . in this case , as we saw before , @xmath206 .",
    "so @xmath136 is generated by @xmath60 , @xmath63 and @xmath218 . in @xmath7",
    "each element of @xmath136 gives rise to a permutation of arcs @xmath158 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "so there is a homomorphism , say @xmath187 , from @xmath136 to @xmath219 , the symmetric group of order @xmath220 acting on indices of arcs .",
    "then we have @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 , and thus three elements @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 generate @xmath219 as follows : @xmath227 so we have the following short exact sequence : @xmath228 where @xmath186 is the inclusion and @xmath229 is isomorphic to @xmath230 , generated by @xmath231 .",
    "we here note that this sequence does not split . using combinatorial group theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath136 as follows : @xmath232    we finally consider the case where @xmath1 is odd and @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath57 is odd and @xmath58 . in this case",
    "@xmath136 is generated by @xmath233 and @xmath234 because @xmath235 .",
