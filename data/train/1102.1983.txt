    "when we nodded , the target was placed at the center of the field of view for half the total integration time , and the other half placed the target into a corner of the array for frames to be used for background subtraction .",
    "we used the reduction technique described in carr & najita ( 2008 ) .",
    "we used the integrations of the nearby blank sky to identify hot pixels , which were removed from the science frames by interpolation using custom routines in idl .",

    "a similar procedure was used to extract spectra from the regularly observed hr 6688 , which we used for standard star division , to remove fringing , and for flux calibration . because the fringing in each observation is dependent on the target position on the slit ,",
    "each data frame was divided by the standard star observation that showed the least amount of fringing in the shorter wavelengths after division .",
    "any residual fringing was removed using irsfringe in idl .",
    "calibration of the sl spectra is highly dependent on the slit position , so we used the optimal point source extraction in the spitzer irs custom extractor ( spice ; version 2.2 ) to extract the individual spectra before co - adding .",
    "the spitzer irs spectrum of dg tau b , with an average s / n=100 per pixel , can be seen in fig .",
    "a 10% continuum flux difference between the sh and sl modules was corrected by scaling the sh by a constant , without any adjustment to the continuum shape , to match the sl at wavelengths where the orders overlap .",
    "the spectrum shows the amorphous silicates , co@xmath0 ice absorption , water ice , and an absorption feature at 6.8 mm , which is possibly due to methanol ( watson et al .",
    "2004 , zasowski et al .",
    "2009 ) , as well as the co@xmath0 gas absorption at 15.2 mm as previously recognized by pontoppidan et al .",
    "we further detect [ neii ] emission at 12.81 mm with line intensity @xmath12 .",
    "the spitzer irs spectrum of vv cra shown in fig .",
    "1 , with s / n=160 per pixel , is of the combined binary components as they were unresolved within the slit .",
    "it can be seen there is a continuum mismatch between sh and sl modules , likely due to being centered on the irc and from the modules having different slit position angles and widths .",
    "the sh and sl modules have position angles 221.5@xmath1 and 136.7@xmath1 ( for a spitzer roll angle of 0@xmath1 ) , respectively , so during the sh observation the binary components were separated 0.31@xmath10 across the 4.7@xmath10 slit while during the sl observation the components were separated 1.20@xmath10 across the 3.6@xmath10 slit .",
    "the sl1 is at an intermediate wavelength and flux , so we scaled the sl2 and sh modules by a constant to match the intermediate sl1 continuum .",
    "we find the system displays amorphous silicate absorption and co@xmath0 ice absorption at 15.2 mm .      to reduce our phoenix and nirspec spectra , we used standard spectral reduction routines in iraf .",
    "after flatfielding each frame , we subtracted nod pairs to remove the sky emission .",
    "the target spectra were extracted using _ apall _ in iraf with background subtraction using both sides of the profile ( from both sides of the total binary profile for vv cra ) . in order to increase s / n and for better telluric division",
    ", we first extracted the spectrum from each individual science and standard star frame ( standards listed in table 1 ) .",
    "we then divided each science spectrum by each standard star spectrum using their corresponding airmass , then co - added the spectra .",
    "we found that applying telluric division before co - adding the spectra resulted in better telluric correction .",
    "the wavelength solution was made by using the iraf task _ identify _ on sky emission lines in coadded science frames .",
    "the rest frame wavelengths of the emission lines were taken from the hitran database ( rothman et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "our nirspec spectra of dg tau b , seen in fig .",
    "2 , have s / n=21 and 28 per pixel for orders 15 and 16 , respectively , and we found both @xmath11co and @xmath13co in absorption ( see table 2 ) . the average line profiles for the low- and high - j @xmath11co transitions have slightly different velocity shifts and widths ( see table 3 and fig .",
    "3 ) which indicates we are likely probing multiple velocity components .",
    "we were able to clearly resolve the vv cra components with phoenix , and the spectra , shown in fig . 4 , had an average s / n of 220 per pixel for the irc and 280 for the primary .",
    "the vv cra irc displays @xmath13co and optically thick @xmath11co in absorption ( see table 4 ) , as well as a shallow , broad @xmath11co absorption feature with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see line profile in fig .",
    "the vv cra primary shows cold @xmath11co within broader @xmath11co emission lines .",
    "the cold , unresolved @xmath11co absorption lines have @xmath16 while using the 4-pixel slitwidth with resolution @xmath17 , suggesting our resolution was limited by the psf of the target rather than the entire slit width .",
    "the primary and irc both also show a complicated emission structure .",
    "this structure can be understood as a blend of broad co emission lines from numerous ro - vibrational levels .",
    "both of the vv cra components show co overtone emission ( prato et al .",
    "2003 ) with emission up to at least the v=4 - 2 vibrational band",
    ". the observed co fundamental bands are consistent with the expectation of a hot , optically thick emission spectrum . in this respect ,",
    "the spectra are similar to the extreme t tauri star rw aur ( najita et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the t - recs images show a resolved vv cra binary ( fig .",
    "images were made by subtracting nod pairs and co - adding the resulting images .",
    "high winds caused poor image quality , so we created custom idl routines to center each data frame on the peak of the primary companion before co - adding .",
    "this gave better final image quality , but we did not detect any extended emission .",
    "we measured photometric fluxes using a 2.1@xmath10 aperture centered on each component and on the standard star observations , which were then used for flux calibration ( see results in table 5 ) . while the primary does show a hint of silicate absorption , a majority of this feature seen in the spitzer irs spectrum originates in the irc .",
    "we find that the broadband fluxes measured with t - recs fit the spitzer irs spectrum if we assume we are collecting only 70% of the flux from the primary ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , with the flux loss likely due to slit losses from being centered on the irc .",
    "all of our models of the co and co@xmath0 gas were done using a single temperature slab model .",
    "we fit the @xmath13co r(16 - 19 ) transitions with the assumption the transitions are optically thin and found a temperature of 2887 k with column density @xmath18 ( see population diagram in fig . 7 ) .",
    "if we fit the high - j @xmath11co p(25 - 27 , 30 ) lines to an optically thin model as well , we find the gas would be at a high temperature of @xmath19 with @xmath20",
    ". however , this would indicate a @xmath11co/@xmath13co ratio of only 2.2 , much lower than the mean ratio found in the local ism ( wilson 1999 ) .",
    "this indicates all of the observed @xmath11co lines are likely optically thick . to constrain the temperature of the absorbing gas",
    ", we modeled @xmath11co gas with a column density @xmath21 , estimated using the n(@xmath13co ) and mean isotopic ratio of 69@xmath226 from wilson ( 1999 ) , and varied the turbulence and temperature .",
    "we could not model all the @xmath11co transitions to a single temperature , with the low - j transitions always showing higher optical depths than permitted by fits to the high - j transitions .",
    "this is likely due to multiple velocity components being viewed in the low - j transitions , which would account for the difference in velocity shift and width from the high - j transitions .",
    "we thus fit only the high - j p(25 - 27 , 30 ) transitions , and the goodness - of - fit , shown in fig .",
    "7 , indicates the gas is likely @xmath23 with a doppler b - value @xmath24 .",
    "if the @xmath11co is self - shielding and the @xmath11co/@xmath13co is raised to 100 , similar to the ratios found in s09 , these values would not change much as the temperature would still be @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we find the model for the co@xmath0 gas has degenerate fits by changing the microturbulence and temperature , so we use the doppler b - value of @xmath27 found with the co gas , and find @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we further find upper limits for c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn , two other organic molecules detected toward irs 46 ( lahuis et al .",
    "2006 ) , to compare molecular abundance ratios . to get upper limits on column densities",
    ", we note that temperatures of both the co and co@xmath0 gases toward dg tau b are similar to that found toward irs 46 ( 400 and @xmath30 , respectively ) , so we start with the assumption that if c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn are present , they would have similar temperatures to irs 46 ( 700 and 400 k , respectively ) . to derive the upper limits , we individually modeled the absorption spectrum for the molecules at those temperatures .",
    "we then used the model - generated profiles to measure feature strengths at various wavelengths in the dg tau b spectrum , giving us a distribution of feature strengths we would expect to measure given only the spectral noise .",
    "we then set the upper limit as the column density that would provide a 3@xmath31 integrated intensity .",
    "we find the upper limit on the c@xmath0h@xmath0/co@xmath0 ratio ( < 0.19 ) is not very different from the ratio measured for irs 46 ( 0.3 ) , suggesting the non - detection of c@xmath0h@xmath0 in our data may be the result of the lower absorbing column in this source .",
    "the upper limit on the hcn / co@xmath0 ratio ( < 0.22 ) is a factor of two smaller than was measured for irs 46 ( 0.5 ) .",
    "modeling the gas at higher temperatures with similar column densities decreases the integrated intensity of the absorption features , so higher gas temperatures would result in higher upper limits on the column densities .",
    "a temperature increase of @xmath32 would raise the column density upper limit by @xmath215% for both molecules .",
    "if we model the molecules at @xmath30 , like the co@xmath0 gas , the upper limits of the c@xmath0h@xmath0/co@xmath0 and hcn / co@xmath0 ratios would be 0.06 and 0.18 , respectively .",
    "the [ neii ] emission , as seen toward dg tau b , is a feature commonly found by spitzer irs toward ttss ( lahuis et al .",
    "gdel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that among tts the [ neii ] emission strength increases with the jet mass loss rate , the latter as inferred from the high velocity component of the [ oi ] emission .",
    "mundt & fried ( 1983 ) found that hh 159 , a jet associated with dg tau b , has a mass loss rate of @xmath33 .",
    "if we assume dg tau b is @xmath34 away , our measured [ neii ] luminosity of @xmath35 is similar to that of tts with comparable mass loss rates ( cf .",
    "5 , gdel et al .",
    "as we do not see c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn in the disk , a simple explanation is they have low abundances in the disk .",
    "this could possibly be due to photodissociation .",
    "the [ neii ] emission may be an indication the gas is irradiated by x - rays ( glassgold et al .",
    "2007 ) , and/or uv irradiation ( hollenbach & gorti 2009 ) , which in turn could reduce the c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn in the disk .",
    "however , many t tauri stars with [ neii ] emission similar to or stronger than that of dg tau b show emission in c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn ( carr & najita 2011 , in prep ) .    alternatively , as c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn are commonly found in circumstellar disks ( pontoppidan et al .",
    "2010 ) , these species could be in the disk but simply not in our line of sight .",
    "this may be implied by the most striking difference between dg tau b and irs 46 : while the column density of co toward dg tau b is only 10 times that toward irs 46 , the gas ratios to co in dg tau b are 1%-2% of that found toward irs 46 ( see table 6 ) .",
    "also , the limits on the ratios n(c@xmath0h@xmath0)/n(co ) and n(hcn)/n(co ) are much smaller for dg tau b than the measured ratios toward gv tau n ( gibb et al . 2007 ) .",
    "while the large co column toward dg tau b implies we are probing a large amount of disk material , we are not detecting the large columns of other gaseous species .    the disk chemistry model in agndez",
    "2008 ) may provide further insight into the disk conditions probed by our observations .",
    "they focus their models on the photon dominated region of the disk , and use photochemistry to estimate the steady state abundances of simple organic molecules .",
    "they show the c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn have low abundances for disk radii @xmath36 , and the co / co@xmath0 is large for radii @xmath37 .",
    "while the temperatures we measured for co and co@xmath0 are cooler than expected for radii < 1 au , the vertical structure of these molecules is not available .",
    "one possible scenario is the line of sight passes below the main temperature inversion layer .",
    "doppmann et al . ( 2008 ) note gv tau n has a larger @xmath38 than other class i ysos in taurus ( typically @xmath39 ; furlan et al .",
    "2008 ) , and suggest this could happen if a majority of the probed silicate is residing in a warm region of the disk atmosphere .",
    "we calculate this ratio for dg tau b and irs 46 for comparison . to do this",
    ", we used a polynomial fit across the features to determine the initial continua . for the silicate feature",
    ", we fit to the continuum in the 13 - 14.8 mm region , and to the continuum between the water and `` methanol '' ice at wavelengths < 7.8 mm . for the co@xmath0 feature , we assume the co@xmath0 ice is located at larger disk radii than the silicate , as found by watson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , so the ice is absorbing from a continuum already including the silicate absorption features .",
    "we thus use a continuum for dg tau b that is modified from that used in watson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , found by fitting the spectrum at wavelengths 13 - 14.8 mm and > 15.6 mm .",
    "the continuum fits are shown in fig .",
    "we then used the relation @xmath40 , where i@xmath41 is the observed flux and i@xmath42 is the emitted continuum , to find @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "lahuis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found irs 46 to have @xmath45 , and pontoppidan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) shows @xmath46 . while both irs 46 and dg tau b have higher ratios than found for class i objects in taurus , both gv tau n and irs 46 have higher ratios ( @xmath47 and 8.6 , respectively ) than dg tau b ( 6.6@xmath220.4 ) . additionally , using the co@xmath0 ice column density measurements for irs 46 and dg tau b found in pontoppidan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we find irs 46 has a higher co@xmath0 gas / ice ratio , about 8 times that of dg tau b. this suggests the line of sight toward irs 46 is predominantly probing warmer regions than toward dg tau b , resulting in the detection of c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn .    alternatively ( or in addition ) , the ratios of co@xmath48 gas , ice and silicate could simply be a factor of disk inclination . if the lines of sight for irs 46 and gv tau n pass higher in the disk atmosphere than for dg tau b , raising the silicate to ice ratio , it could also be probing a moderately different region of the disk where the organic molecules reside .",
    "if we are only viewing the cold to moderate temperature ( @xmath49 ) regions deeper in the disk in dg tau b , the c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn production would be lower in these regions , thus lowering the steady state abundances ( agndez et al .",
    "2008 ) and resulting in their non - detection .",
    "if this is the case , the detection of pre - biotic molecules in absorption may be highly sensitive to the line of sight , even for edge - on disks .",
    "this could possibly further explain the rarity of molecular absorption among spitzer irs spectra of young stars .",
    "our phoenix spectra of the vv cra system shows @xmath11co transitions in absorption toward both components .",
    "however , the optically thick lines for the irc and few lines for the primary make it difficult to extract accurate temperature and column density measurements .",
    "we therefore use the co abundances reported in s09 for the irc . to get the temperature and column density of the cold @xmath11co toward the primary",
    ", we obtained the crires spectra used in s09 from the eso archive .",
    "we reduced the data using a similar procedure to that used for the phoenix and nirspec , although the wavelength calibration and telluric division were performed using a telluric model fitter ( seifahrt et al . 2010 ) .",
    "we find the cold gas toward the primary has a column density of @xmath50 and temperature @xmath51 ( population diagram is shown in fig .",
    "while doppler velocity shifts of the @xmath11co v=(2 - 0 ) absorption lines reported for the irc in s09 are @xmath52 , the crires spectrum shows a smaller shift for the v=(1 - 0 ) lines ( @xmath53 ) , similar to the shift we found with the phoenix spectrum ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "one change between the phoenix and crires spectra is the crires spectrum does not show the broad , shallow lines , but rather displays other @xmath11co lines in the -40 to -@xmath55 range ( see fig . 9 ) .",
    "thus , these broad lines are in a turbulent , varying region , possibly located in an outflow .",
    "while the near - ir spectrum of vv cra is quite complicated , the spitzer irs spectrum of the vv cra binary shows only amorphous silicate and co@xmath0 ice absorption . to determine the optical depths of the silicate and co@xmath0 ice",
    ", we used the broadband fluxes found with the t - recs images to estimate continua for the two components .",

    "this could simply be a function of lower gas abundances in the disk , or this could be due to probing a slightly different region of the disk where c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn have lower abundances , as is suggested by the gas column densities and gas / ice ratios .",
    "although we are viewing an edge - on disk like irs 46 and gv tau n , this could imply molecular absorption is highly sensitive to even moderate changes in the line of sight in the disk , which may account for the rarity of such detections even in edge - on disks .",
    "further , the large co column density to extinction ratio indicates the disk is likely showing a large amount of grain growth and dust settling when compared to other disks ( rettig et al .",
    "finally , while the velocity shift of the absorbing co gas is difficult to explain , the most likely scenario currently appears to be the co is in the disk while the main continuum emitting source or the absorbing gas is non - axisymmetric .    while the spitzer irs spectrum of vv cra shows only silicate and co@xmath0 ice absorption , high - resolution spectroscopy reveals the disk has a complicated and changing near - ir spectrum .",

    "<S> we present findings for dg tau b and vv cra , two of the objects observed in our spitzer irs project to search for molecular absorption in edge - on disks , along with near - ir spectroscopy of the co fundamental transitions and mid - ir imaging . while the only gas absorption seen in the spitzer irs spectrum toward dg tau b is co@xmath0 , we use gas abundances and gas / ice ratios to argue that we are probing regions of the disk that have low organic molecule abundances . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the rarity of detecting molecular absorption toward even edge - on disks with spitzer irs is a result of high dependence on the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue the disk around dg tau b shows high amounts of grain growth and settling . for vv cra , we use the silicate absorption feature to estimate a dust extinction , and model the disk with a spectral energy distribution fitting tool to give evidence in support of the disk geometry presented by smith et al . </S>",
