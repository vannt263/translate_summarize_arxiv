    "many mathematical models of fluid mechanics are derived through the approximation of the solution of boundary value problems for euler equations .",
    "for example , equations for bubbly flows are derived as an approximation of the solution of a complex free - boundary problem describing the motion of the mixture of water and gas bubbles ( iordanski ( 1960 ) , kogarko ( 1961 ) , wijngaarden ( 1968 ) ) . green - naghdi s model describing wave motions of a liquid layer of finite depth in a shallow water approximation with account of dispersion effects is another example ( green _ et al _ ( 1974 ) , green & naghdi ( 1976 ) ) . due to the fact that averaging procedures and asymptotic expansions have been used in the derivation , it is not obvious to decide what boundary conditions are natural for these systems of equations . in this paper , a hamiltonian formulation of the problem in ( @xmath0-space is proposed which allows one to find boundary conditions for a general class of models .",
    "this class includes a model of bubbly fluid and dispersive shallow water .",
    "we use the boundary conditions to study the stability of two co - flowing layers of bubbly and pure fluids . in absence of gravity and capillarity",
    ", it is well known that kelvin - helmholtz instability develops for any wave lengths in the flow of two superposed layers of pure incompressible fluids ( see , for example , drazin & reid ( 1981 ) ) .",
    "we prove that the presence of bubbles in one layer can produce a stabilizing effect : the flow becomes stable with respect to perturbations of some wave lengths .",
    "here we calculate the variation of hamilton s action for a special class of lagrangians . usually this procedure is used only for derivation of governing equations .",
    "we obtain below not only governing equations but also boundary conditions at inner contact surfaces .",
    "let us consider the lagrangian of the form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 is the time , @xmath4 is the space variable , @xmath5 @xmath6 is the fluid density and @xmath7 is the velocity field**. * * let us calculate the variation of hamilton s action in the case when the 4-d momentum @xmath8 verifies the equation of continuity : @xmath9 hamilton s action is defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a material domain . considering a smooth one - parameter family of virtual motions @xmath12 ( @xmath13  stands for the lagrangian coordinates , @xmath14 is a small parameter at the vicinity of zero and @xmath15 is the real motion ) , we define the virtual displacements @xmath16 and the lagrangian variations @xmath17 by the formulae : @xmath18 due to the fact that @xmath19 , we consider the variations as functions of eulerian coordinates and use the same notations @xmath20 and @xmath21 in eulerian variables . hamilton s",

    "the transposition is denoted by @xmath24 . for any vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 we use the notation @xmath27 for their scalar product @xmath28 and @xmath29 for their tensor product @xmath30 .",
    "the divergence of the second order tensor @xmath31 is a covector defined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is any constant vector field . @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "are respectively divergence and gradient operators in the _",
    "4-d _ and _ 3-d _ space .",
    "the identity matrix and the zero matrix of dimension @xmath38 are denoted by @xmath39 and @xmath40.in calculations we shall use the equality @xmath41 which was proved in gavrilyuk & gouin ( 1999 ) .",
    "variation of the hamilton action is @xmath42 since @xmath43 and @xmath44 we get from ( [ moment ] ) and ( [ var1 ] ) : @xmath45 with @xmath46 for the sake of simplicity the measure of integration will not be indicated .",
    "since for any linear transformation @xmath31 and vector field @xmath47 @xmath48 we get @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 and finally @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 let us denote @xmath59 then @xmath60 @xmath61 with @xmath62 , @xmath63 denotes the surface velocity and @xmath64 is the space unit normal vector .",
    "virtual displacements vanish at the boundary @xmath23 and the surface integral is zero .",
    "the volume integral yields the equations of motion in conservative form as in gavrilyuk & gouin ( 1999 ) . in the case when fluid tensorial quantities are discontinuous at the inner interface @xmath65 , expression ( [ actionvar ] ) becomes @xmath66 @xmath67\\ ] ] where the jump through @xmath65 is denoted by @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "we explicit the governing equations and the inner boundary conditions for the lagrangian @xmath69 such a lagrangian appears in the study of wave propagation in both shallow water flows with dispersion and bubbly flows ( a complete discussion of these models is given in gavrilyuk & teshukov ( 2001 ) ) .",

    "notice that this method did not give jump conditions ( [ bondcond ] ) . system ( [ sysnon ] ) is reminiscent of euler equations for compressible fluids .",
    "the term @xmath84 in equations of motion ( [ sysnon ] ) and boundary conditions ( [ pressure ] ) stands for the pressure .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath84 is not a function of density as in the case of barotropic fluids : it depends also on material time derivatives of the density .",
    "thus , @xmath84 is not usual thermodynamic pressure . in general",
    ", it implies that the boundary conditions are not just consequences of conservation laws .",
    "for example , for korteweg - type fluids where the stress tensor depends on the density gradient , the boundary conditions contain normal derivatives of the density at interfaces ( seppecher ( 1989 ) , gouin & gavrilyuk ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "as we have shown here , the boundary conditions at inner interfaces in bubbly fluids do not depend on normal derivatives of the density : they involve only tangential derivatives.if the flow domain is shared between two domains consisting of pure ideal fluid and bubbly fluid , all previous calculations are still valid and boundary conditions ( [ pressure ] ) can be extended to such a case .",
    "now , we propose to use conditions ( [ pressure ] ) to study kelvin - helmholtz instability of a parallel flow between two rigid walls of a layer of bubbly fluid in contact with a layer of pure incompressible fluid .",
    "consider the 2-d flow of two superposed finite layers of inviscid fluids in the channel : @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "the first one is governed by the euler equations : @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the constant density of pure fluid , @xmath89 is the velocity field and @xmath90 is the pressure.in the domain @xmath91 governing equations ( [ sysnon ] ) for the second fluid are @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 here @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the average density , velocity and mixture pressure , respectively ; @xmath98 is a given potential . for the flow of compressible bubbles having the same radius ,",
    "potential @xmath99 has the form ( see , for example , gavrilyuk ( 1994 ) and gavrilyuk & teshukov ( 2001 ) ) : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the internal energy of the gas in bubbles , @xmath102 is the bubble radius , @xmath103 is the gas density , @xmath104 is the density of carrying phase , @xmath105 is the bubble mass concentration , @xmath38 is the number of bubbles per unit mass .",
    "potential @xmath99 is the difference between the internal energy of gas and the kinetic energy of fluid due to radial bubble oscillations .",
    "the bubble radius and the bubble density are functions of the average density @xmath106@xmath107 it can be shown that governing equations ( [ bubbly ] ) with potential ( [ potential ] ) coincide exactly with classical equations of bubbly fluids ( kogarko ( 1961 ) and van wijngaarden ( 1968 ) ) . in particular , the role of `` equation of state '' @xmath108 plays the rayleigh - lamb equation which governs the radial oscillations of a spherical bubble : @xmath109 the equivalence between ( [ rl ] ) and ( [ equationstate ] ) with @xmath99 given by ( [ potential ] ) has been proved , for example , in gavrilyuk ( 1994 )",
    ". dissipation - free model ( [ bubbly])-([potential ] ) assumes that the sliding between components is negligible .",
    "moreover , this model is valid only when the volume fraction of bubbles is very small .",
    "notice that a detailed description of the bubble interaction has been recently done by russo & smereka ( 1996 ) and herrero , lucquin - desreux & perthame ( 1999 ) in the case of rigid bubbles , and smereka ( 2002 ) , teshukov & gavrilyuk ( 2002 ) in the case of compressible bubbles , by using a kinetic approach.at the rigid walls @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the vertical components of the velocity are equal to zero @xmath112 in accordance with the previous section , we prescribe the following boundary conditions at the contact interface @xmath113 : @xmath114",

    "it means that the flows with equal velocities are stable.let us consider the general case when @xmath162 equation ( [ char ] ) can be rewritten as a polynomial of fourth degree .",
    "the stability needs that all four roots are real . to study this problem , it is convenient to rewrite the dispersion relation ( [ char ] ) in the form @xmath163 with @xmath164 @xmath165 here @xmath166 is similar to the mach number , @xmath167 is the dimensionless length of perturbation wave . obviously , @xmath168 is real if and only if @xmath155 is real .",

    "the dispersion relation has two real roots and two complex roots .",
    "precise formulations are given in the following propositions .",

    "it means that the flow is always unstable with respect to perturbations with sufficiently short wave lengths ( as it follows from proposition 4 , the dispersion relation has complex roots ) .",
    "the flow with subsonic relative velocity is stabilized in an intermediate interval of wave lengths if the pure liquid layer is thin enough with respect to the bubbly layer . in the case of supersonic relative velocity a similar stabilization",
    "is observed for long waves ( see proposition 2 and inequalities ( [ case12 ] ) ) . for another intermediate interval of wave lengths ( [ case13 ] ) the stabilization of perturbations",
    "is attained for layer depths of the same order ( see proposition 3 ) .",
    "we have derived from hamilton s principle of stationary action governing equations and boundary conditions at the contact interfaces in bubbly fluids .",
    "it has been shown that the dynamic condition on the interface reduces to the continuity of the average pressure . by using the boundary conditions derived , we have studied the kelvin - helmholtz instability of two superposed layers of a pure incompressible fluid and a bubbly fluid .",
    "we have shown that in contrast to the case of two incompressible fluids when the instability develops for any length of perturbations ( if the gravity , capillarity or compressibility are not taken into account ) , the presence of bubbles can stabilize the flow in some range of perturbation wave lengths .",
    "the stabilizing effect is due to the following reason .",
    "the development of classical kelvin - helmholtz instability leads to the appearance of wave - like bulges at the interface between two fluids .",
    "the presence of bubbles in a fluid ( i.e. new interfaces ) permits one to transform a part of the energy responsible for the bulge formation into the energy of radial oscillations of bubbles .    the viscosity effect on the flow stabilization is an important issue .",
