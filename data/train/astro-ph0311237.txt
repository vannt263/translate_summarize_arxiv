    "the recently discovered nearby t - dwarf companion to @xmath0 indi ( scholz et al . 2003 ) will be important in improving our understanding of the behavior of the brown dwarfs that fall within the newly defined l and t spectral types ( e.g. , kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999 ; geballe et al .",
    "the t - dwarf reported by scholz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) was discovered by volk et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to be a close optical double consisting of an early t dwarf ( @xmath0 indi b ) and a late t dwarf ( @xmath0 indi c ) separated by 0.6 arcseconds . with an accurately known distance of 3.626@xmath50.009 pc , @xmath0 indi ba and bb are the nearest known brown dwarfs .",
    "they share a common proper motion with the k5v star @xmath0 indi , lying at a projected distance of @xmath101460 au from their presumed primary star .",
    "the age of @xmath0 indi itself has been estimated by lachaume et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to be @xmath100.8 to 2.0 gyr : this age estimate is based upon its rotational velocity and ca ii k - line emission . @xmath0",
    "indi ba and bb are thus brown dwarfs with very well - defined luminosities and approximate ages .",
    "we present the first high - resolution infrared spectroscopic observations of @xmath0 indi b. synthetic spectra computed from unified cloudy models by tsuji ( 2002 ) are compared to the observed high - resolution spectra ; these comparisons are used to derive the stellar parameters of effective temperature ( t@xmath4 ) , surface gravity ( defined as log g ) , and projected rotational velocity ( vsin(i ) ) .",
    "high - resolution infrared ( ir ) spectra were obtained on @xmath0 indi ba using the 8.1 m gemini south reflecting telescope and the noao phoenix spectrometer ( hinkle et al .",
    "this instrument is a cryogenically cooled echelle spectrograph that uses order separating filters to isolate individual echelle orders .",
    "the detector is a 1024x1024 insb aladdin ii array .",
    "the size of the detector in the dispersion direction limits the wavelength coverage in a single exposure to about 0.5 % ( 1550 km s@xmath8 or @xmath100.0120@xmath2 m at 2.3@xmath2 m and @xmath100.0080@xmath2 m at 1.6@xmath2 m ) .",
    "one edge of the detector is blemished so the wavelength coverage on all but the brightest source is typically trimmed a few percent to avoid this area .",
    "the spectra discussed here were observed with the widest ( 0.35 arcsecond ) slit resulting in a spectral resolution of r=@xmath1/@xmath3@xmath1= 50,000 .",
    "two spectral regions were observed , with one centered at @xmath1=2.314@xmath2 m and the other centered at 1.555@xmath2 m .",
    "these spectral regions sample crucial diagnostic lines from the molecules co , h@xmath13o , and ch@xmath14 .    at the time of our observations we were unaware of the existence of @xmath0",
    "indi bb . following the discovery ( volk et al .",
    "2003 ) we re - examined our acquisition images .",
    "acquisition images of @xmath0 indi b at 1.647 @xmath2 m taken on 2003 august 13 under good conditions ( 0.4 `` fwhm delivered image quality ( diq ) ) confirm the volk et al .",
    "( 2003 ) detection . the companion can also be seen in 1.558 @xmath2 m images on 2002 december 29 , although it is less well - resolved due to inferior seeing ( 0.8 '' arcsec diq ) .",
    "it is , however , barely perceptible at 2.321 @xmath2 m ( 2003 january 16 ) with 0.4 `` diq .",
    "the issue relevant to the current investigation is the extent to which the spectrum of @xmath0 indi b might suffer contamination from a nearby companion .",
    "the observed image profile at 1.647 @xmath2 m is well fit by a model in which the companion is fainter by 1.9 mag and is 0.65 '' away at a position angle of 125 degrees . at 2.321 @xmath2 m",
    "the magnitude difference is @xmath15 3 between the two stars , so that the companion could contribute no more than 6% to the spectrum in this region .",
    "our data prevent an estimate at 1.558 @xmath2 m but volk et al .",
    "( 2003 ) report a difference of 1.3 magnitudes .",
    "in addition the position angle is at 35 degrees to the 0.35 arcsecond slit .",
    "detailed examination of the spectral images showed no trace of @xmath0 indi bb at the location expected so we are confident that our spectra are contributed almost entirely by @xmath0 indi ba .",
    "each program star was observed along the slit at two or three separate positions separated by 4 `` to 5 '' on the sky : the delivered image fwhm at the spectrograph varied from 0.25``-0.80 '' during the nights that spectra were taken , so stellar images at different positions on the slit were well separated on the detector .",
    "equal integration times were used for a particular program star during a particular set of observations . with this observing strategy , sky and",
    "dark backgrounds are removed by subtracting one integration from another ( the star being at different positions on the detector array ) . during each night , 10 flat - field and 10 dark images were recorded for each given wavelength setting of the echelle .",
    "a hot star , with no intrinsic spectral lines in the regions observed , was also observed each night in each observed wavelength region .",
    "two - dimensional images were reduced to one - dimensional spectra using an optimal extraction algorithm described in johns - krull , valenti , & koresco ( 1999 ) .",
    "wavelengths and telluric corrections in the 2.31 @xmath2 m region were determined by fitting observed telluric features with a scaled atmospheric transmission function from wallace & hinkle ( 2001 ) .",
    "there are no significant telluric features in the 1.56 @xmath2 m region , so the wavelength scale was determined by matching a spectrum of hr 1629 ( k4 iii ) with an ir fts atlas of arcturus ( hinkle , wallace , & livingston 1995 )    figure 1 illustrates the combined and reduced spectra for @xmath0 indi ba in both the 2.313@xmath2 m and 1.556@xmath2 m regions , with the wavelengths plotted as air wavelengths .",
    "the data points have been smoothed over the slit width of 4-pixels and the final signal - to - noise ratio is about 3040 .",
    "the 2.31@xmath2 m region contains strong vibration - rotation lines from the first overtone bands of co ( here ( 20 ) lines from @xmath16c@xmath17o ) , as well as some weak , blended h@xmath13o features , and weak absorption from methane .",
    "detectable spectral features at 1.55@xmath2 m are not as strong as at 2.31@xmath2 m , nor as well - defined as the individual vibration - rotation co lines , and consist mostly of blended h@xmath13o features .",
    "two of the stronger features can be assigned to mainly two h@xmath13o lines ( as marked in figure 1 ) on the basis of the study of h@xmath13o by tereszchuk et al .",
    "the observed spectra of @xmath0 ind ba at 2.313@xmath2 m and 1.556@xmath2 m are compared to synthetic spectra calculated from model atmospheres as discussed by tsuji ( 2002 ) .",
    "these models are so - called `` unified cloudy models '' in which dust is allowed to exist in the photosphere over a limited range defined by a condensation temperature , t@xmath18 , and a critical temperature , t@xmath19 , such that dust is found in the region of t@xmath19 @xmath20 t @xmath20 t@xmath18 . at the critical temperature , dust grains become so large that they precipitate from the the photosphere .",
    "the models employed in this analysis are computed with plane parallel geometry , in hydrostatic equilibrium , and have solar abundances .",
    "figure 2 illustrates a comparison of observed and synthetic spectra , for both the 2.313@xmath2 m ( top panel ) and 1.556@xmath2 m ( bottom panel ) regions .",
    "the 2.313@xmath2 m spectrum contains strong @xmath16c@xmath17o ( 20 ) lines and some weak h@xmath13o features .",
    "the 1.556@xmath2 m spectrum exhibits primarily h@xmath13o absorption , with these features composed of many blended individual spectral lines . in the top panel ,",
    "the comparison synthetic spectra span effective temperatures from 1400k to 1800k and these models have surface gravities of log g= 5.5 ( in units of cm s@xmath6 ) .",
    "this particular spectral region is illustrated as any ch@xmath14 absorption beginning near @xmath1@xmath10 2.3158@xmath2 m , and clearly apparent in the models with t@xmath4=1400k or 1500k , is very temperature sensitive .",
    "its observed absence ( or extreme weakness ) in @xmath0 ind ba indicates that t@xmath4= 1600k ; higher effective temperatures begin to produce co lines that are too weak .",
    "the co lines that dominate this region are not very sensitive to gravity over the expected range for the brown dwarfs with these approximate temperatures ; however , the 1.556@xmath2 m region features dominated by h@xmath13o are more sensitive to surface gravity , as shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 . here , a slightly lower effective temperature is derived , with t@xmath4=1400k , and the gravity sensitive h@xmath13o features indicate that log g@xmath105.0 to 5.5 .",
    "higher effective temperatures produce h@xmath13o absorption features that are too weak for any reasonable surface gravity , while temperatures much lower than t@xmath4=1400k ( say 1300k ) produce increasingly strong ch@xmath14 absorption , which looks nothing like the observed spectrum of @xmath0 ind b. this effect is shown by the t@xmath4=1300k model spectrum in the bottom panel of figure 2 that is offset vertically from the observed spectra and 1400k models .",
    "the offset is done as the different absorption features in the 1300k model ( that are caused by increasing ch@xmath14 and decreasing h@xmath13o absorption ) , if overlaid on the observed spectrum , would produce merely confusion .",
    "fits to the line profiles ( primarily the strong co lines ) , as shown in figure 2 , also yield the projected rotational velocity , with vsin(@xmath7)=28 km s@xmath8 ( with an uncertainty of @xmath53 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "wavelength shifts between observed and synthetic spectra also provide an accurate radial velocity for @xmath0 ind b , which we find to be v@xmath21= 41.0@xmath50.7 km s@xmath8 .",
    "this radial velocity is very close to the published value for @xmath0 ind a s velocity of 39.6@xmath50.8 km s@xmath8 from wielen et al .",
    "the similarity of radial velocities for both @xmath0 ind a and ba strengthens their physical association , as argued by scholz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) based on their respective distances and proper motions .    the combination of both the 2.314@xmath2 m and 1.555@xmath2 m high - resolution spectra and their comparison to synthetic spectra result in values for temperature and gravity in @xmath0 ind ba to be t@xmath4=14001600k and log g=5.05.5 . taking the average of these values as being the best estimates we find an effective temperature of 1500k and a gravity of log g=5.25 .",
    "scholz et al . ( 2003 ) used photometry to derive the luminosity of @xmath0 ind ba and found it to be log(l / l@xmath9)=4.67 .",
    "this luminosity can be combined with our estimates of temperature and gravity to yield a spectroscopic mass estimate of 32m@xmath11 .",
    "scholz et al . ( 2003 ) derive a mass of 40 - 60m@xmath11 , which is close to the mass derived from the high - resolution spectra .",
    "in addition , given the luminosity and effective temperature , the radius of @xmath0 ind ba can be estimated and then combined with the projected rotational velocity to yield a maximum rotational period . with log(l / l@xmath9)=4.67 and t@xmath4= 1500k , a radius of ( r / r@xmath9)= 0.069 is derived . given vsin(@xmath7)=28",
    "km s@xmath8 , then the maximum rotational period for @xmath0 ind ba will be 3.0 hours .    the effective temperature derived by scholz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is 1260k and results from the luminosity combined with the distance and a radius defined by a theoretical m@xmath12radius relation that results from structural models of brown dwarfs .",
    "this t@xmath4 is somewhat lower than our value of 1500k , however this difference is typical of the differences found to date between spectroscopically derived effective temperatures and those derived from structural models .",
    "the differences in t@xmath4 also indicate differences in the implied radii from the two methods . in our case ,",
    "the higher spectroscopic t@xmath4 for @xmath0 ind ba requires a smaller radius to support its luminosity .",
    "the two techniques are complementary , in the sense that the radius does not enter into the computation of the plane parallel atmosphere , but does in the m@xmath12radius relation .",
    "age uncertainties can also affect derived physical paprameters , especially for the structural models .",
    "larger sets of comparison measurements of physical parameters derived from both model atmospheres and structural models will improve our understanding of the root cause of these differences .",
    "a comparison of the temperature scales is illustrated in figure 3 , where spectroscopic t@xmath4 s are plotted versus structural t@xmath4 s ; the spectroscopic temperatures are taken from basri et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , leggett et al . ( 2001 ) , and schweitzer et al . ( 2002 ) , while the structural temperatures are those from dahn et al . (",
    "the dahn et al .",
    "t@xmath4 s also use a m@xmath12radius relation from structural models in deriving temperatures . despite using different sets of model atmospheres ( with differing treatments of dust )",
    ", there is a clear trend in the differences between the spectroscopically derived effective temperatures when compared to the structural temperatures from dahn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the spectroscopic t@xmath4 s tend to fall below the structural t@xmath4 s , with the reverse situation at lower temperatures and a crossover point at @xmath101900 - 2000k .",
    "our derived t@xmath4 for @xmath0 ind b falls nicely on the cool end of this trend .",
    "we do not speculate here on the reasons for the systematic differences between structural and spectroscopic effective temperatures .",
    "the treatment of dust in the photosphere is a crucial ingredient in the quantitative spectral modelling of the cool l and t dwarfs .",
    "here we have used the unified dust models as discussed in detail by tsuji ( 2002 ) ; however , we also investigated other dust treatments to see what effects these would have on the derived physical parameters ( primarily t@xmath4 ) .",
    "two other sets of model atmospheres were generated : 1 ) one in which dust remained in all layers where the thermochemical conditions allowed dust condensation ( case b ) , and 2 ) the other being the case where all dust sank out of the photospheric layers ( case c ) .",
    "these very same effects were also investigated and discussed in detail by basri et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for a sample of late - m and l dwarfs . in our case",
    "b , where dust exists over a wide range of depths in the photosphere , the model absorption lines ( co , h@xmath13o , and ch@xmath14 ) are all much weaker than the observed absorption lines ( the addition of significant dust opacity over a large region of the photosphere weakens the gas phase absorption lines ) , and no realistic fit to the observed spectra is possible for any reasonable t@xmath4 . for the atmospheres where all dust sinks from the photosphere ( case c ) , the model molecular absoprtion lines have more realistic strengths , but the temperature sensitive ch@xmath14 appears at even higher effective temperatures ; we derive t@xmath4=1800k for @xmath0 indi ba .",
    "the disagreement with the structural models is even worse here .",
    "this exercise suggests that some dust in the photosphere provides a better physical picture in modelling the high - resolution ir - spectra of @xmath0 ind ba .",
    "our initial comparison here points to the need for more high - resolution spectral analyses across the temperature range of the l and t dwarfs .",
    "we have used high - resolution infrared spectra of the nearest brown dwarf , @xmath0 ind b , to derive its physical parameters using comparisons to synthetic spectra calculated from model atmospheres .",
    "the spectroscopic t@xmath4=1500k , with log g=5.2 , and an estimated mass of m=32m@xmath11 .",
    "the projected rotational velocity is vsin(@xmath7)=28 km s@xmath8 , indicating a maximum rotational period of @xmath103.0 hours .",
    "the comparison between the t@xmath4 scales derived from spectroscopic plus model atmosphere analyses against those derived from m@xmath12radius relations reveals a significant systematic difference that is unexplained .",
    "the staff of the gemini south observatory are to be thanked for technical support .",
    "we also thank j. tennyson for his comments on the h@xmath13o assignments , and the referee ( g. basri ) for helpful suggestions in improving this paper .",
