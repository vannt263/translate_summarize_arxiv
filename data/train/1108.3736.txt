    "partially ordered set @xmath17 together with a topological embedding @xmath8 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 endowed with the scott topology , denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "this is a variant of a fundamental problem in domain theory , called the maximal point space problem , which demands a homeomorphism between @xmath16 and the space of maximal point of @xmath17 .",
    "the study of computational models for various type of topological spaces goes back to the works of edalat and respectively blanck @xcite .",
    "later , the maximal point space problem was explicitly formulated and became a subject of intensive investigations by many authors @xcite .",
    "some special cases of this problem have satisfactory solutions @xcite .",
    "the domain theoretic construction @xmath19 of the space of formal balls , introduced by edalat and heckmann , provides a concrete ( computational ) model for a metric space @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the importance of this construction is that , first of all , it connects some metric properties of @xmath1 to the order theoretic properties of @xmath19 .",
    "secondly , it ties the above notion of computational model to the notion of computability for metric space @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the notion of formal balls is also defined in the same way for a quasi - metric space @xmath1 and the order theoretic properties of @xmath4 are tightly connected to the topological properties of @xmath1 @xcite . in particular , for a @xmath0 quasi - metric space @xmath1 is sequentially yoneda - complete if and only if @xmath4 is a directed complete partially ordered set .",
    "edalat and heckmann also constructed the plotkin powerdomain @xmath20 of the space of formal balls of a metric space @xmath1 and showed that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the nonempty compact subsets of @xmath1 and the maximal elements of the plotkin powerdomain of @xmath21 .",
    "as an application , a domain theoretic proof was given for a classical result of hutchinson ( @xcite ) which states that if @xmath1 is complete , then any hyperbolic iterated function system has a unique non - empty compact attractor .",
    "it can be shown that this construction is a computational model for the hyperspace of nonempty compact subsets of @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath2 , with the vietoris or equivalently the hausdorff topology .",
    "this fact was also proved in a different way by martin in @xcite .",
    "his interesting idea is based on the existence of a certain measurement , called lebesgue measurement , on any domain @xmath11 which models the metric space @xmath1 .",
    "subsequently , liang and kou in @xcite generalized these results to continuous dcpo s which have the lawson condition , i.e. the lawson and scott topologies coincide on the space of maximal points .",
    "indeed , under the lawson condition , it is proved that there is a homeomorphism between the space of nonempty compact subsets of maximal points of a continuous dcpo @xmath11 endowed with the vietoris topology and the space of maximal points of plotkin powerdomain @xmath11 equipped with the induced scott topology .",
    "more recently , in another line of research , berger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that for any @xmath0 topological space which is represented by an @xmath3-domain @xmath11 , the hyperspace of its nonempty compact subsets can be represented by the plotkin powerdomain @xmath23 of domain @xmath11 .",
    "this result was made possible by a theorem of smyth ( @xcite ) which states that for any @xmath3-continuous dcpo @xmath11 the space @xmath24 is homeomorphic to the space of @xmath11-lenses , i.e. nonempty compact subsets of domain @xmath11 which are intersection of a closed set and a saturated set , endowed with the vietoris topology .    in the present work ,",
    "we study computational models of the hyperspace @xmath25 of a @xmath0 quasi - metric space @xmath1 equipped with the vietoris and respectively the hausdorff topology , proving that whenever @xmath1 satisfies certain completeness properties , e.g. yoneda and respectively smyth completeness , this space has a computational model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the space of formal balls of a quasi - metric space does not generally satisfy the lawson nor countable based conditions .",
    "therefore , the results of liang and kou @xcite and berger et al .",
    "@xcite do not apply to the present context .",
    "also , unlike the metric case , there is no natural candidate for a measurement on the space of formal balls of a quasi - metric space and hence the method used by martin in @xcite can not be applied here either .",
    "edalat and heckmann used the plotkin powerdomain @xmath20 given as the ideal completion of the abstract basis of finite subset of @xmath21 , @xmath26 , with respect to the egli - milner relation , @xmath27 , to present a computational model of @xmath25 , for every metric space @xmath1 . to this end , they employed the symmetry axiom of metric @xmath28 , to get a key fact that any maximal ideal has a cofinal @xmath3-chain . in the case of quasi - metric spaces , the plotkin powerdomain @xmath20 can also be defined , though , the lack of symmetry for the quasi - metric @xmath1 prevents us from finding cofinal @xmath3-chains in maximal ideals .",
    "that is why we prefer to work directly with the @xmath3-chains and this leads us to the chain - completion construction instead .",
    "so , for a @xmath0 quasi - metric space @xmath1 , we consider the space @xmath21 of formal balls and let @xmath29 be the chain completion of @xmath30 .",
    "this construction is called the @xmath3-plotkin domain . by the general construction of chain completion",
    ", @xmath29 is a continuous @xmath3-dcpo , i.e. a continuous poset in which every @xmath3-chain has a least upper bound .",
    "now , to achieve our purpose in finding a computational model , we define a one - to - one map @xmath31 , which is an embedding if we consider the vietoris topology on @xmath25 and assume that @xmath1 is a sequentially yoneda - complete @xmath0 quasi - metric space .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 is an embedding with respect to the topology of the hausdorff quasi - metric @xmath9 on @xmath25 if any compact subset of @xmath22 is @xmath7-precompact .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 serves as an @xmath3-computational model for @xmath25 endowed with the mentioned topologies .",
    "although it is not known whether @xmath29 is a dcpo and therefore a computational model of @xmath25 , nevertheless , thanks to fact [ idealcompletion ] and theorem [ dcpo ] , the ideal completion of @xmath29 gives a computational model for @xmath25 .    in section 5 ,",
    "we take another well - known notion of computational model , called the quantitative @xmath3-computational model .",
    "this is an @xmath3-computational model @xmath33 carrying an additional quasi - metric @xmath11 such that @xmath8 is an isometry from @xmath1 into @xmath34 together with some extra conditions which capture the order structure of @xmath17 ( definition [ quantitative ] ) .",
    "a modified version of this notion can be found in @xcite .",
    "we prove that in fact @xmath29 is a quantitative @xmath3-computational model for @xmath35 , by constructing a quasi - metric @xmath11 on @xmath29 . to this end",
    ", we consider a quasi - metric @xmath36 defined by romaguera and valero ( @xcite ) on @xmath4 .",
    "the primary reason to choose this quasi - metric on @xmath19 is that @xmath37 is a quantitative computational model for @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , its specialization order @xmath38 is equivalent to the partial order of @xmath19",
    ". consequently , one could naturally extend @xmath36 to the hausdorff quasi - metric @xmath39 on @xmath40 of the finite subsets of @xmath41 , whose main property is that it induces the egli - milner relation on @xmath40 .",
    "subsequently , the quasi - metric @xmath42 can be lifted up to a quasi - metric @xmath11 on @xmath29 in such a way that the ordered structures @xmath43 and @xmath44 coincide .",
    "once @xmath11 is established one can show that @xmath45 is a yoneda - complete space and in fact yoneda - completion of @xmath46 .",
    "this makes @xmath47 a quantitative @xmath3-computational model for @xmath48 .",
    "we , finally , conclude this paper by comparing the plotkin powerdomain and the @xmath3-plotkin domain constructions .",
    "we prove that if @xmath1 is either , smyth - complete and all of its compact subsets are @xmath7-precompact , or an @xmath3-algebraic yoneda - complete space , then the plotkin powerdomain @xmath49 is order - isomorphic to @xmath50 .",
