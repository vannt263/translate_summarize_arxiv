    "passive q - switching based on the use of both semiconductor @xcite and crystalline @xcite saturable absorbers is of particular interest due to compactness , simplicity , high damage threshold , and diode - pumping ability of an oscillator .    among the active media allowing diode - pumped q - switching , ky(wo@xmath0)@xmath1 ( kyw ) and",

    ", there is possible a high - efficient self - frequency shift and a simultaneous two - wavelengths pulsing ( e.g. , at 1.35 and 1.54 @xmath3 m for a nd : kgw active medium ) directly from an oscillator .",
    "theoretical studies of a q - switched oscillator with the intra - cavity srs have been based on the well - established rate - equations approach @xcite .",
    "the oscillator parameters providing a pulse width minimization @xcite and an output energy maximization @xcite at both fundamental and stokes wavelengths have been defined .",
    "simultaneously , it has been found that the spatial structure of a laser field is strongly affected by the srs @xcite .",
    "this means that the mode transformation has to be taken into account along with the temporal evolution of fields and populations inside an active medium and a saturable absorber .",
    "such a model has been developed to a gaussian mode approximation for both fundamental and stokes fields @xcite .",
    "this has allowed defining the optimal values of the raman gain and the ratio of pump and laser beams , which provide a single pulse operation of oscillator with the most efficient srs .",
    "nevertheless , a transient character of q - switching can prevent from the cw mode formation and disturb substantially the spatial structure of a laser field .",
    "this requires to take into account the spatial dynamics on a par with the temporal one .    in this work we present the analysis of spatially - temporal dynamics of a passively q - switched raman - active oscillator .",
    "the analysis is based on a rate - equations approach but without imposing a limitation on the shape of cylindrically symmetric transverse distribution of a field .",
    "the results demonstrate that there exist both spatial extra - broadening and squeezing as well as transition between non - gaussian and gaussian spatial profiles in dependence on the oscillator parameters ( viz .",
    "output mirror transmission at the fundamental and stokes wavelengths , initial transmission of a saturable absorber and curvature of a spherical mirror ) .",
    "the srs contribution controlled by the optimized sets of oscillator parameters allows the regularization of the spatially - temporal structure of a field and the substantial pulse shortening .",
    "the oscillator under consideration consists of the flat ( output ) and spherical mirrors .",
    "the active medium ( nd@xmath2:kgw ) is placed at the resonator center , and the saturable absorber ( v@xmath2:yag ) is placed on the output mirror .",
    "the model is based on a direct generalization of that presented in @xcite .",

    "the q - switching `` mode '' has a shape of a dilative ring , which rises and then disappears ( after @xmath6112 ns ) with a gain depletion . in the presence of srs , such a `` mode '' is suppressed owing to an inhomogeneous `` collapsing '' spatially - temporal behavior at both fundamental and stokes wavelengths ( fig .",
