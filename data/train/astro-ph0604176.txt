    "detection of the stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves has profound implications for the physics of the early universe and the high energy physics that is not accessible by particle accelerators .",
    "the basic reason why relic gravitational waves carry information about the very early universe is that particles which decoupled from the primordial plasma at a certain time , @xmath1 , when the universe had a temperature of @xmath2 , memorize the physical state of the universe at and below @xmath3 .",
    "since gravitons decoupled below the plank energy scale , the relic gravitons memorize all the expansion history of the universe after they decoupled and thus would probe deeper into the very early universe .",
    "gravitational waves act therefore as the _ time machine _ that allows us to see through the entire history of the universe .",
    "another example of relic species is the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , which decoupled from matter at @xmath4 ev and can trace the physical state of the universe back to 0.3 ev . on the other hand ,",
    "the primordial gravitational waves carry information on the state of the much earlier universe than the cmb photons do .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the evolution of primordial gravitational waves through changes in the physical conditions in the universe within the standard model of elementary particles and beyond .",
    "for instance , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase to hadron gas phase transition causes a sharp feature in the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "the change of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom affects the hubble rate by reducing the growth rate of the hubble radius during the transition .",
    "thus , the rate at which modes re - enter the horizon is changed during the transition and a step in the spectrum appears at frequencies on the order of the hubble rate at the transition . for the qgp phase transition this frequency is @xmath5 hz today and the correction is about 30% @xcite .",
    "other large drops in the number of relativistic degrees of freedom occur at electron positron annihilation and possibly at the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking .",
    "since the gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , one can search for evidence of supersymmetry in the very beginning of the universe by looking at the relevant frequency region ( @xmath6 hz ) . for energy scales lower than neutrino decoupling ( @xmath7 mev @xcite ) we shall also account for the damping effect from neutrino free - streaming .",
    "the primordial gravitational wave spectrum will also provide us with information about inflation .",
    "the energy scale of inflation is directly related to the amplitude of the spectrum .",
    "the modes which re - entered the horizon during the radiation dominated epoch show a nearly scale invariant spectrum if we do not consider the change of the effective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "typically the amplitude of the spectrum is of order @xmath8 for @xmath9 gev inflation energy scale in such a frequency region .",
    "inflation ends when the inflaton decays into radiation and reheats the universe .",
    "the energy scale of reheating could be seen from the highest frequency end ( @xmath10 ) of a nearly scale invariant energy density spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the lowest frequency mode observable today corresponds to the horizon size today , and the interval between the lowest frequency and @xmath11 would give the number of @xmath12-holdings , which tells us the duration of inflation between the end of inflation and the time at which fluctuations having the wavelength of the current horizon size left the horizon during inflation .",
    "the slope of the spectrum provides the power - law index of the tensor perturbation , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 corresponds to a scale invariant power spectrum from de sitter inflation . in a large class of inflationary models",
    "@xmath15 is not zero but much smaller than unity , and its determination constrains the inflationary models . as the effect of @xmath13 has been investigated by many authors , e.g. @xcite , and is easy to include , we shall assume de sitter inflation ( @xmath16 ) throughout this paper .",
    "our result is general and easily applicable to any kind of models which produce primordial tensor perturbations .",
    "( e.g. ekpyrotic models @xcite ) .",
    "the primordial gravitational waves not only test and probe the physics of inflation and reheating , but also can provide the tomography of the standard model of particle physics and models beyond .",
    "the study of its spectrum enables us to probe the very early universe in a truly transparent way .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show how the constituents in the early and very early universe would affect the primordial gravitational wave spectrum , which is observable in principle and may be observable in the future by the next generation observational projects , such as the big bang observer ( bbo ) proposed to nasa @xcite and the decigo proposed in japan @xcite .",
    "we present a new , rigorous computation of the primordial gravitational wave spectrum from de sitter inflation with the standard model of particle physics .",
    "it is easy to extend our results to non - de sitter ( e.g. , slow - roll ) inflation models .",

    "the second term represents the effect of the expansion of the universe . using conformal time derivatives ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "we may obtain @xmath50 this is just the massless klein - gordon equation for a plane wave in an expanding space with a source term .",
    "thus , each polarization state of the wave behaves as a massless , minimally coupled , real scalar field , with a normalization factor of @xmath51 relating the two .",
    "next , let us consider the time evolution of the spectrum .",

    "energy density of gravitational waves evolves just like that of radiation inside the horizon , @xmath85 , for @xmath74 .",
    "this implies that the relative spectral energy density , @xmath69 , inside the horizon remains independent of time during the radiation era while it decreases as @xmath86 during the matter era .",
