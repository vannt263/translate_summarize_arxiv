    "high - energy cosmic - ray electrons can not propagate far from the sources , because the electrons lose rapidly energy with an energy loss rate of the square of energy through these radiative processes .",
    "these processes during the propagations through the galaxy without hadronic interactions simplify modeling of the propagation of electrons compared with other cosmic - ray components such as nucleons .",
    "evidence for non - thermal x - ray emission from supernova remnants ( snrs ) indicate that high - energy electrons in the tev region are accelerated in snrs ( * ? ? ?",
    "these observations strongly suggest that cosmic - ray electrons are accelerated in snrs , and that snrs are the most likely primary sources of cosmic - ray electrons . @xcite",
    "first pointed out that the electron spectrum in the tev region depends on the age and distance of a few local sources .",
    "his proposed concept has been accepted in later calculations of cosmic - ray electrons ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the energy spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons have unique spectral structures in the tev region due to the discrete effect of local sources .",
    "this means that we can identify cosmic - ray electron sources from the electron spectrum in the tev region .",
    "in addition , it is discussed that some dark matter may produce negative electrons and positrons in the energy region of around @xmath6  tev via dark matter annihilations or decaying dark matter ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * e.g. ) .",
    "in particular , in the case of mono - energetic electrons from dark matter , although propagation through the galaxy would broaden the line spectrum , the observed electron spectrum could still have distinctive features .",
    "thus , the observations of high - energy electrons bring us unique information about sources and propagation of cosmic rays , and enable us to search for dark matter .",
    "although the cosmic - ray electrons have been observed with many kinds of detectors since 1960 @xcite , most observations are limited below several 100  gev @xcite . among these observations ,",
    "the first - time cosmic - ray electron observation with nuclear emulsions was achieved by @xcite .",
    "they indicated that nuclear emulsions are ideal for the detection of electrons among many background protons because of the excellent imaging capability with a high position resolution of 1  @xmath7 m .",
    "the reason for the difficulty of the electron observations is that the electron flux itself is very low and decreases with energy much more rapidly than that of protons because of the electro - magnetic energy loss .",

    "[ fig : espec_models ] , our observed spectrum is consistent with the calculated spectra of the distant component @xmath14 nearby component by @xcite , giving strong evidence for a non - zero flux in the tev region , by the definite identification of electron events one by one .",
    "figure  [ fig : espec_models ] also presents that the electron energy spectrum observed with emulsion chambers has the significantly larger flux in the tev region than that of the distant component .",
    "this suggests that nearby electron sources such as snrs exist within the distance of @xmath55  kpc and the age of @xmath23  yr .",
    "we have carried out cosmic - ray electron observations with the balloon - borne emulsion chambers since 1968 .",
    "the emulsion chamber is an excellent imaging detector with a high position resolution of @xmath55  @xmath7 m .",
    "this imaging capability enables the emulsion chamber to identify electrons with the high rejection power against gamma rays and protons , which is the highest proton rejection power of @xmath23 among the existing cosmic - ray electron detectors , and to determine electron energies by using only the central part of the electro - magnetic shower .",
    "this leads for the emulsion chamber to have thin thickness , lower mass , and a wide field of view , compared to the other detectors .",
    "hence , the emulsion chambers , even the comparatively lightweight instruments , successfully observed electrons above several 100  gev in the late 1960s and electrons above 1  tev in the 1980s .",
    "further , these electron observations initiated discussions about the investigation of the propagation mechanisms in the galaxy and the identification of nearby cosmic - ray electron sources .",
    "being recognized for the significance of the electron observations , the high - energy electron observations opened up and have been recently carried out by atic , fermi - lat , h.e.s.s . ,",
    "pamela , and so on . in order to identify nearby cosmic - ray electron sources and",
    "search for dark matter signals , there are also some ongoing and new experiments for the high - energy electron observations such as ams-02 and calet on the international space station ( iss ) @xcite .",
    "ams-02 is ongoing to observe positrons and negative electrons up to 1  tev .",
    "calet is being developed to be installed on the iss , preserving the excellent imaging characteristics of the emulsion chamber .",
    "we sincerely thank the late prof .",
    "j.j.lord and the late prof .",
    "t.taira , who started up this experiment program , brought us to many successful balloon observations , and worked on the development of the experiments .",
    "we are also grateful to a number of collaborators who have carried out together the experiments since 1968 .",
    "we thank the crews of the sanriku balloon center ( sbc ) of isas / jaxa and the nasa columbia scientific balloon facility ( csbf ) for their excellent and successful balloon flights .",
    "we acknowledge the staffs of institute for cosmic ray research ( icrr ) , university of tokyo for their kind support to emulsion experiments .",
    "we also appreciate the excellent work and kind support of the staffs in research center for electron photon science of tohoku university and the h4 beam line of cern - sps .",
    "we are grateful to y. sato for his kind support at cern in the beam tests .",
    "the flux of cosmic - ray electrons is much smaller than that of cosmic - ray protons",
    ". the observed flux ratio of electrons against protons is around 1  % for 10  gev and 0.1  % for 1 tev .",
    "therefore , in order to observe high - energy electrons above 1  tev , the proton rejection power is required to be at least larger than @xmath105 .",
    "we estimate the proton rejection power with the emulsion chamber in the following .      while an electron produces the first @xmath106 pair within 2  r.l . with the probabilities of 99.9  % for 100  gev electrons and 99.5  % for 1  tev electrons with the threshold energy of 10  mev for pair production , a proton interfaces hadronically with a mean free path ( m.f.p . ) of about 30  r.l . in lead .",
    "hence , the probability for hadronic interactions of a proton within 2  r.l . in the emulsion chamber is @xmath107 , so that the proton rejection power for the difference between interaction lengths of electrons and protons is about @xmath108 .",
    "secondary neutral pions produced via hadronic interactions of a proton have in total about 30  % of the parent proton energy .",
    "therefore , giving the same shower energy with an electron , the energy of the parent proton should be three times larger than that of the electron . since the integral cosmic - ray proton spectrum has a power - law form of @xmath109 , the effective flux of protons",
    "is reduced to be @xmath110 .",
    "thus , the proton rejection power for the energy shift effect of the proton - induced shower is about 7 .",
    "electrons produce gamma rays via bremsstrahlung radiation , and then the gamma rays produce @xmath106 pairs . therefore , the almost electron - induced shower at the starting point in the emulsion chamber is composed of 3 tracks ( one electron + one @xmath106 pair ) or 5 tracks ( one electron + two @xmath106 pairs ) .",
    "the mean spreading distance @xmath111 of a parent electron and an @xmath106 pair by coulomb scattering is approximately given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a traversing thickness of the electron in the material , @xmath114 is a radiation length of the material , @xmath115 is a path length of the electron , @xmath61 is the electron energy , and @xmath116 is the scattering constant of @xmath117  mev . in the case of @xmath118",
    "( i.e. @xmath119  cm for lead ) and @xmath120  cm , the spreading distance @xmath111 is @xmath121  @xmath7 m for the primary electron energy of 100  gev and @xmath122  @xmath7 m for that of 1  tev , taking the electron energy @xmath61 to be a half of the incident electron energy because of the energy loss by bremsstrahlung radiation .    among hadronic interactions of high - energy protons with nuclei , possible candidates to be the mimic",
    "electron events of protons are the following events .",
    "the forward produced charged secondary particles are narrowly collimated without the heavily ionizing tracks , which are recorded by low - energy recoil protons and nuclei , and the number of the charged secondary particles is just 1 , 3 or 5 , accompanied with one neutral pion .",
    "in addition , they have no multi - structures in their cascade showers .",
    "in fact , there are such phenomena that the momentum transfer to the target nuclei is relatively low and hence the number of the secondary particles is relatively small , what is called diffraction dissociation .    in order to study diffractive coherent production in hadronic interactions of protons with nuclei , the experiments with nuclear emulsions have been performed for 400 gev and 800 gev of proton beams by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "they selected the events with the number of the secondary charged particles of 1 , 3 or 5 , with the relatively low momentum transfer to the target nuclei , and without the heavily ionizing tracks . according to their results , the fractions of these selected events to the total hadronic interaction events are 3  % for 400  gev protons and 2  % for 800  gev protons .",
    "given that the spreading angle of the forward produced secondary particles is @xmath56  rad , the radial distance between the secondary particles is @xmath81  @xmath7 m with a path length of 1  cm .",
    "since this distance is one order of magnitude larger than the typical distance between a parent electron and an electron - positron pair , the proton events with the spreading angle larger than @xmath56  rad are readily identifiable from the electron events . adding the condition of the spreading angles less than @xmath56  rad , the residual events are less than @xmath123  % of the measured diffraction dissociation events , that is , the fraction of the selected events to the total hadronic interaction events is less than 3  % @xmath264  % @xmath124  % for 400  gev protons and 2  % @xmath264  % @xmath125  % for 800  gev protons .    for the electron - like events of protons ,",
    "since there are also further conditions that the selected events should be accompanied with one neutral pion and have no multi - structures in the shower developments , the above fraction gives us just the upper limit .",
    "hence , the proton rejection power with the shower starting point is estimated to be larger than @xmath126% @xmath127 .      as described above",
    ", the proton rejection powers are @xmath108 for the difference between interaction lengths of electrons and protons , @xmath128 for the energy shift effect of the proton - induces shower , and @xmath129 for the shower starting point , respectively .",
    "combined these independent proton rejection powers , the total proton rejection power is estimated to be larger than @xmath130 .",
    "thus , for the electron observations with the emulsion chambers , the proton contamination in the tev region is estimated to be less than @xmath11  % .",
