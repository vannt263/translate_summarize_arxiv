    "the x - ray transient grs  1915 + 105 was discovered with the watch all sky x - ray monitor ( castro - tirado et al . 1992 ) and it has been exhibiting a wide variety of temporal variability in its x - ray emission .",
    "it has been identified with a superluminal radio source ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) and attempts have been made to connect the jet production with the hard x - ray emission from the accretion disk ( harmon et al .",
    "a simultaneous x - ray and infrared observation of the source established a close link between the non - thermal infrared emission ( presumably coming from a `` baby - jet '' analog of the superluminal ejection events ) and the x - ray emission from the accretion disk ( eikenberry et al .",
    "a diverse variability in the x - ray emission , episodes of superluminal jet emission and evidences of disk - jet symbiosis has made grs  1915 + 105 an ideal source to examine several concepts of accretion physics , black - hole environment , disk - jet connection etc .",
    "greiner et al . ( 1996 ) presented the x - ray variability characteristics of grs  1915 + 105 using the rossi xte data which included repeated patterns of brightness sputters , large amplitude oscillations , fast oscillations and several incidences of prolonged lulls .",
    "narrow quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) in the x - ray emission were discovered from the source using the indian x - ray astronomy experiment ( agrawal et al .",
    "1996 ) and the rxte ( morgan & remillard 1996 ) .",
    "chen , swank & taam ( 1997 ) found that the narrow qpo emission is a characteristic feature of the hard branch and it is absent in the soft branch which corresponds to the very high state similar to those of other black hole candidates .",
    "morgan , remillard , & greiner ( 1997 ) made a systematic study of the different qpos seen in grs  1915 + 105 which ranged from 3 mhz to 67 hz and based on the power spectra , light curves and energy spectra classified the x - ray emission into four different emission states , none of which appear identical to any of the canonical states of black hole binaries .",
    "paul et al . ( 1998b ) , however , found that the 0.5  10 hz qpo traces the change of state from a `` flaring state '' to a low - hard state quite smoothly along with other x - ray characteristics like the low frequency variability .",
    "trudolyubov , churazov , & gilfanov ( 1999 ) studied the 1996/1997 low luminosity",
    "state and state transitions using the rxte data and concluded that the qpo centroid frequency is correlated with the spectral and timing parameters and these properties are similar to other galactic black hole candidates in the intermediate state .",
    "muno , morgan , & remillard ( 1999 ) sampled the rxte data over a wide range of properties and found that the 0.5  10 hz qpo can be used as a tracer of the spectral state of the source and the source mainly stays in two states : the spectrally hard state when the qpo is present and the soft state when the qpo is absent .",
    "the x - ray intensity variations seen in grs  1915 + 105 were classified as lull , flare and splutter in greiner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and each of these states last for a few hundred seconds .",
    "similar x - ray light curves were analyzed in detail by belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a ; 1997b ) who classified them as `` outbursts '' ; they found that the source shows distinct and different spectral and temporal characteristics during the `` quiescence '' and outburst .",
    "taam , chen , and swank ( 1997 ) detected a wide range of transient activity including regular bursts with a recurrence time of about one minute and irregular bursts .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 1997b ) made a detailed spectral analysis during a sequence of `` bursts '' and discovered a strong correlation between the quiescent phase and burst duration .",
    "paul et al . ( 1998a ) detected several types of bursts using the ixae data and found evidence for matter disappearing into the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "yadav et al .",
    "( 1999 ) made a systematic analysis of these bursts and classified them based on the recurrence time .",
    "yadav et al . ( 1999 ) presented a comprehensive picture for the origin of these bursts in the light of the recent theories of advective accretion disk .",
    "it was suggested that the peculiar bursts are characteristic of the change of state of the source .",
    "the source can switch back and forth between the low - hard state and the high - soft state near critical accretion rates in a very short time scale , giving rise to the irregular and quasi - regular bursts .",
    "the fast time scale for the transition of the state is explained by invoking the appearance and disappearance of the advective disk in its viscous time scale .",
    "the periodicity of the regular bursts is explained by matching the viscous time scale with the cooling time scale of region beyond a shock front or a centrifugal barrier ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a study of the time variability and spectral characteristics of the source grs 1915 + 105 during the irregular bursts .",
    "we show that during these bursts the source makes distinct transitions between the two spectral states in a few seconds . in section 2",
    "we present results obtained from an analysis of the data obtained from the proportional counter array ( pca ) of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) . in section 3",

    "it can be seen from the figure that the source was in a stable low - hard state up to 1997 april 25 ( day number 1210 ) when the average asm count was 20 s@xmath3 .",
    "barring three episodes of dipping behaviors ( which could be absorption dips seen in other black hole candidate sources like 4u 1630 - 47 - see kuulkers et al .",
    "1998 ) , the source flux was stable with a rms deviation of 15% .",
    "it should be noted here that the asm data , with a dwell time of 90 s and about 20 dwells per day , is insensitive to short term variabilities .",
    "the spectral and temporal behavior during the low - hard state was stable characterized by a hard spectrum ( with the power - law index of @xmath02 , and the total flux in the power - law component being @xmath080% ) and 0.5  10 hz qpos ( trudolyubov et al . 1999 ; muno et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the fact that the canonical low - hard states of black hole candidate sources have a negligible thermal component ( chitnis et al .",
    "1998 ) prompted trudolyubov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to characterize this state as an `` intermediate state '' and they conclude that with the lowering of the accretion rate the source should go to the canonical hard state .",
    "since the source was in similar state on several occasions ( 1996 july - august ; 1997 october ; 1998 september - october ) , we treat this state as the `` low - hard state '' of grs-1915 + 105 .    after 1997",
    "april 25 the source started a steady increase in its x - ray emission with an average increase in the asm count rate of 0.65 s@xmath3 day@xmath3 and reaching a count rate of 76 s@xmath3 in the middle of july ( day number 1290 ) .",
    "the variability , as can be deduced from the asm count rates and measured as the fraction of rms to mean , steadily increased from 15% to 40% .",
    "it should be noted that during the low - hard state of 1996 july - august the source showed similar variability behavior : the rms variation was low ( 5 - 10% ) during the low - hard state and it was @xmath040% just before and after this state ( paul et al .",
    "1998b ) . the variability , however , decreased to @xmath415% around 1997 june ( day number 1260 ) . during this period",
    "the source showed evidences of continuous `` ringing '' flares ( vilhu and nevalainen 1998 ; yadav et al .",
    "1999 ) , with time scales of 30  60 s and these will not be evident in the asm data .",
    "the variability increased again from june end ( day number 1275 ) and the flaring state continued for about 20 more days with the asm variability being 30 - 40% .",
    "the source reached a steady state with low variability ( @xmath010% ) .",
    "the ringing flares started again in the beginning of 1997 august ( yadav et al .",
    "1999 ) and towards the end of this state the peculiar outbursts accompanied by infrared flares were observed on 1997 august 14 - 15 ( eikenberry et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the source was relatively quiet thereafter for about 10 days and then went into a flaring state . on september 9",
    "the peculiar `` outburst '' was seen again ( markwardt et al . 1999 ) .    for a given accreting system ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the long term changes in the x - ray emission is due to changes in the accretion rate .",
    "unlike cygnus x-1 where the source transition typically takes place in a few days , the state transition in grs  1915 + 105 took about three months .",
    "if we attribute the state transition as due to a change in the accretion rate near some critical accretion rate ( as has been done in chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ) , the slow state transition can be used to study the system in detail at this critical rate . in this scenario the variety of bursts and variability seen in grs  1915 + 105 can be attributed to phenomena near this critical state . here",
    "we address the question of the fast state transition that has occurred in 1997 june 18 . from figure 1",
    "we can see that the bursting properties systematically changed during the transition .",
    "in yadav et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( see their figure 2 ) it was shown that for about a month the source was in a burst mode with a slow transition from regular bursts to irregular bursts and then again to a regular burst of shorter duration .",
    "in yadav et al .",
    "( 1999 ) it was postulated that the irregular bursts are manifestations of rapid state changes . to quantify the properties of the spectral states we have taken two rxte observations each in the low - hard and high - soft states . in the low - hard state the observation carried out on 1997 march 26 ( towards the end of the low - hard state ) and another on 1997",
    "may 8 ( in the beginning of state transition ) were selected .",
    "in the high - soft state observations carried out on 1997 july 20 and 1997 august 19 were chosen . the 1997 may 8 and 1997 august 19 observations are the same that are used in yadav et al .",
    "the x - ray emission properties of the source in the spectral states as deduced from these observations are compared with that obtained during the irregular bursts observed on 1997 june 18 .",
    "some salient features of the selected observations are given in table 1 .",
    "we use the standard 2 mode data which gives 128 channel energy spectra every 16 s ( used for the spectral analysis ) and 2 channel binned data below 13 kev every 0.125 ms ( used for the timing analysis ) .",
    "the light curves of the selected low - hard and high - soft states of the source are shown in figure 2 , with a time resolution of 1 s. the data is for all the five proportional counter units ( pcus ) and the energy range is 2 @xmath2 13 kev .",
    "the average count rate during the low - hard state of march 26 is 3484 s@xmath3 and it increased to 5600 s@xmath3 for the may 8 data . during the high - soft states of july 20 and",
    "august 19 , the observed count rates were 18330 s@xmath3 and 21669 s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "several features of the state changes in black hole candidates are discernible from the light curve itself . on march 26 (",
    "when the count rate was low ) there was higher variability in the 1 @xmath2 10 s time scale but the source was stable at longer time scales .",
    "the situation was opposite in the high state of august 19 : there is large variability at longer time scale . on",
    "may 8 the count rate increased by about 50% , but the variability characteristics were essentially the same . on july 20 , though the count rate was similar to that of august 19 , the light curve appears similar to that seen during the low state , with several additional spikes at a few tens of seconds .",
    "the behavior of the source is similar to the galactic black hole candidate source cygnus x-1 ( see rao et al 1998 ) when the source showed essentially similar pattern of changes .",

    "though grs 1915 + 105 defies a neat classification between low - hard and high - soft state as seen in other galactic black hole candidate sources , it does exhibit extended low - hard states ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "outside such extended low - hard states the source can be further sub - divided into several states namely bright state ( high - soft state ) , chaotic state and flaring state ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown here that in at least one type of flaring state when the source was showing irregular bursts , the source traverses between low - hard state and the high - soft state .",
    "the pds presented here during the burst quiescence and the low - hard state are similar to that seen during the extended low - hard state of 1996 july - august ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pds is flat up to a few hz with evidence of qpo in the range of 0.5 to 5 hz .",
    "the average power in the range of 0.1 to 1 hz presented here is 0.01 ( rms / mean)@xmath20 hz@xmath3 which is consistent with the earlier observations .",
    "the pds during the burst and the high - soft state are similar to that seen during the bright state of 1996 april ( @xcite ) with the pds being very steep between 0.1 and 5 hz .",
    "we emphasize here that the high - soft and low - hard states of the galactic black hole candidate sources are generally identified only from the strength and shape of the spectra .",
    "since we see spectral changes in a very short time we can conclude that the canonical states too change in such time scales .",
    "the timing characteristics like the shape of pds , qpo , and rms variations give additional support to this .",
    "this reinforces the conclusion drawn earlier ( yadav et al .",
    "1999 ) that the source can make very rapid state transitions",
    ".    there have been attempts to explain the rapid variability seen in grs 1915 + 105 using disk instability models .",
    "taam et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have used scaling laws for viscosity and found that the instability time scales of the inner accretion disk can explain the time scales of the regular bursts seen in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 1997b ) have tried to explain the repeated patterns as due to the appearance and disappearance of inner accretion disk .",
    "nayakshin , rappaport , & melia ( 2000 ) have investigated the different accretion models and viscosity prescriptions and attempted to explain the temporal behavior of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "in particular , they have shown that the accretion instability in a slim disk , as invoked by taam et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , is not likely to adequately account for the behavior of grs 1915 + 105 ( because of the difficulty in maintaining the high state for long ) and the appearance of inner accretion disk , as postulated by belloni et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , will take a time scale comparable to the burst time scale . though nayakshin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) were able to reproduce many characteristics in the x - ray variability for grs  1915 + 105 , they were unable to explain the rise / fall times or the @xmath4 10 s oscillations .",
    "the results presented in this paper , namely , the occurrence of fast changes in the luminosity state , put additional constraints to any disk instability model .",
    "the fact that the spectral states are observed for long durations show that these states are stable solutions for an accretion disk rather than changes in any stability parameters . such stable solutions changing in a short time scale",
    "is difficult to explain in terms of the disappearance of slim disks .",
    "hence in yadav et al . ( 1999 ) it was postulated that these changes are due to appearance and disappearance of sub - keplerian disks above the slim disks .",
    "recently , chakrabarti ( 1999 ) have presented a possible solution to the state transition based on a two component accretion flow ( tcaf ) model given by chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 ) .",
    "they have invoked the initiation of mass outflow ( see also das & chakrabarti 1999 ) as the cause of the start of the state change and the catastrophic compton cooling of the material in a spherical volume causing the reverting back to the high state .",
    "this model essentially reinforces the suggestion of yadav et al .",
    "( 1999 ) but gives a physical basis for the start of the event . in a later work , chakrabarti & manickam ( 2000 ) have expanded this model further and derived a correlation between the burst time and the qpo frequency .",
    "it would be interesting to make a detailed time resolved x - ray spectroscopy during a regular burst to find the slow evolution of the optical depth of the compton cloud .",
    "since the canonical spectral states of black hole binaries remain for considerably long duration ( up to years ) in the same state with similar properties , it is usually assumed that they are some stable solutions for the accretion disk .",
    "it is normally believed that for a given source the total accretion rate is the governing parameter for the spectral changes .",
    "our finding that the source makes very fast repeated state transitions , implies that the two solutions for the accretion disk ( corresponding to the two spectral states ) must exist for roughly the same total mass accretion rate because the time scale of the state change ( @xmath010s ) observed during the irregular bursts is much smaller than the time scale for the readjustment of the accretion disk for any global mass accretion rate changes .",
    "the time scale for the latter must be of the order of thousand seconds because it is normally believed that far away from the compact object the accretion disk can be described as the classical thin disk which has a very large viscous time scale .",
    "hence two solutions for the accretion disk must exist for the same global accretion rate .",
    "such behavior of fast spectral changes must be occurring in other black hole binaries where a wide range of x - ray luminosities are observed , like gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "remillard et al . ( 1999 ) have pointed out the similarity between the temporal properties of grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 when each source teeters between relative stability and a state of intense oscillations .",
    "it will be very interesting to find long duration irregular bursts in gro j1655 - 40 because in this source the binary period and the mass of the black hole are known and hence it will prove an ideal ground to further refine the tcaf model .",
    "we have presented the x - ray spectral and time variability characteristics of grs 1915 + 105 when the source was exhibiting irregular bursts .",
    "the spectral characteristics strongly suggest the view that the source makes a state transition in a very fast time scale ( a few seconds ) . we have found that the temporal variabilities also support this conclusion .",
    "we conclude that the source can make spectral state transition only if the advective and standard thin disk co - exist , as suggested by @xcite ."
