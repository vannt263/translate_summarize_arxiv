    "free electron lasing at wavelengths shorter than ultraviolet can be achieved with a single - pass , high - gain fel amplifier . because a lack of powerful , coherent seeding sources short - wavelength fel amplifiers work in so called self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) mode when amplification process starts from shot noise in the electron beam @xcite .",

    "these devices should produce 100 fs x - ray pulses with over 10 to 100 gw of peak power .",
    "the main difference between projects is the linear accelerator , an existing room temperature linac for lcls at slac , and future superconducting linac for the european xfel .",

    "the amplification process starts from the shot noise in the electron beam .",
    "any random fluctuations in the beam current correspond to a modulation of the beam current at all frequencies simultaneously .",
    "when the electron beam enters the undulator , the presence of the beam modulation at frequencies close to the resonance frequency initiates the process of radiation .",
    "the fel collective instability in the electron beam produces an exponential growth ( along the undulator ) of the modulation of the electron density on the scale of undulator radiation wavelength .",
    "the fluctuations of current density in the electron beam are uncorrelated not only in time but in space , too .",
    "thus , a large number of transverse radiation modes are excited when the electron beam enters the undulator .",
    "these radiation modes have different gain . as",
    "undulator length progresses , the high gain modes start to predominate more and more . for enough long undulator",

    "an intensity gain in excess of @xmath3 is obtained in the saturation regime . at this level",
    ", the shot noise of the electron beam is amplified up to complete micro - bunching , and all electrons radiate almost in phase producing powerful , coherent radiation .",
    "understanding of coherence properties of the radiation from sase fel is of great practical importance .",
    "properties of the longitudinal coherence have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the coherence time increases first , reaches maximum value in the end of the linear high gain regime and then drops when amplification process enters nonlinear stage @xcite .",
    "the first analysis of the problem of transverse coherence has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the problem of start - up from the shot noise has been studied analytically and numerically for the linear stage of amplification .",
    "it has been found that the process of formation of transverse coherence is more complicated than that given by naive physical picture of transverse mode selection .",
    "namely , even after finishing the transverse mode selection process the degree of transverse coherence of the radiation from sase fel visibly differs from the unity .",
    "this is consequence of the interdependence of the longitudinal and transverse coherence .",
    "the sase fel has poor longitudinal coherence which develops slowly with the undulator length thus preventing a full transverse coherence .",
    "first studies of the evolution of transverse coherence in the nonlinear regime of sase fel operation have been performed in @xcite .",
    "it has been found that similarly to the coherence time , the degree of transverse coherence reaches maximum value in the end of the linear regime .",
    "further increase of the undulator length leads to its decrease . despite output power of",
    "the sase fel grows continuously in the nonlinear regime , maximum brilliance of the radiation is achieved in the very beginning of the nonlinear regime .",
    "due to a lack of computing power available at that time we limited our study with a specific numerical example just illustrating the general features of coherence properties of the radiation produced by the sase fel operating in the nonlinear regime .",
    "in this paper we present general analysis of the coherence properties ( longitudinal and transverse ) of the radiation from sase fel .",
    "the results have been obtained with time - dependent , three - dimensional fel simulation code fast @xcite performing simulation of the fel process with actual number of electrons in the beam . using similarity techniques we present universal dependencies for the main characteristics of the sase fel covering all practical range of x - ray fels",
    "design of the focusing system of xfel assumes nearly uniform focusing of the electron beam in the undulator , so we consider axisymmetric model of the electron beam .",
    "it is assumed that transverse distribution function of the electron beam is gaussian , so rms transverse size of matched beam is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is rms beam emittance and @xmath6 is focusing beta - function .",
    "an important feature of the parameter space of xfel is that the space charge field does not influence significantly on the fel process and calculation of the fel process can be performed by taking into account diffraction effects , the energy spread in the electron beam , and effects of betatron motion only . in the framework of the three - dimensional theory operation of the fel amplifier",
    "is described by the following parameters : the diffraction parameter @xmath7 , the energy spread parameter @xmath8 , and the betatron motion parameter @xmath9 @xcite :    @xmath10    where @xmath11^{1/2}$ ] is the gain parameter and @xmath12 is the efficiency parameter @xcite . ] . when describing shot noise in the electron beam , one more parameter appears , the number of electrons on the coherence length , @xmath13 .",
    "the following notations are used here : @xmath14 is the beam current , @xmath15 is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the rms undulator parameter , @xmath18 is relativistic factor , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the undulator wavenumber , @xmath21 17 ka is the alfven current , @xmath22 for helical undulator and @xmath23 for planar undulator .",
    "here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the bessel functions of the first kind . the energy spread is assumed to be gaussian with rms deviation @xmath26 .",
    "the amplification process in the fel amplifier passes two stages , linear and nonlinear .",
    "the linear stage lasts over significant fraction of the undulator length ( about 80% ) , and the main target for xfel optimization is the field gain length . in the linear high - gain limit",
    "the radiation emitted by the electron beam in the undulator can be represented as a set of modes :    @xmath27   \\times \\sum \\limits _ { n , m } a_{nm}(\\omega , z ) \\phi_{nm}(r,\\omega ) \\exp [ \\lambda _ { nm}(\\omega ) z + in\\phi ] \\ . \\label{eq : modes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when amplification takes place , the mode configuration in the transverse plane remains unchanged while the amplitude grows exponentially with the undulator length .",
    "each mode is characterized by the eigenvalue @xmath28 and the field distribution eigenfunction @xmath29 in terms of transverse coordinates . at sufficient undulator length",
    "fundamental tem@xmath30 mode begins to give main contribution to the total radiation power .",
    "thus , relevant value of interest for xfel optimization is the field gain length of the fundamental mode , @xmath31 , which gives good estimate for expected length of the undulator needed to reach saturation , @xmath32 .",
    "optimization of the field gain length is performed by means of numerical solution of the corresponding eigenvalue equations taking into account all the effects ( diffraction , energy spread and emittance ) @xcite .",
    "computational possibilities of modern computers allows to trace complete parameter space of xfel ( which in fact is 11-dimensional ) . from practical point of view",
    "it is important to find an absolute minimum of the gain length corresponding to optimum focusing beta function . for this practically important case",
    "the solution of the eigenvalue equation for the field gain length of the fundamental mode and optimum beta function are rather accurately approximated by @xcite :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 . accuracy of this fit is better than 5% in the range of parameter @xmath35 from 1 to 5 .    equation ( [ eq : lg ] ) demonstrates clear interdependence of physical parameters defining operation of the xfel .",
    "let us consider the case of negligibly small energy spread . under this condition diffraction parameter @xmath7 and parameter of betatron oscillations",
    ", @xmath36 are functions of the only parameter @xmath1 :    @xmath37    fel equations written down in the dimensionless form involve an additional parameter @xmath38 defining the initial conditions for the start - up from the shot noise .",
    "note that the dependence of output characteristics of the sase fel operating in saturation is slow , in fact logarithmic in terms of @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that with logarithmic accuracy in terms of @xmath38 , characteristics of the sase fel written down in a normalized form are functions of the only parameter @xmath39 .",
    "rigorous studies of the nonlinear stage of amplification is possible only with numerical simulation code .",
    "typically fel codes use an artificial ensemble of macroparticles for simulating the fel process when one macroparticle represents large number of real electrons .",
    "thus , a natural question arises if macroparticle phase space distributions are identical to those of actual electron beam at all stages of amplification .",
    "let us trace typical procedure for preparation of an artificial ensemble @xcite .",
    "the first step of particle loading consists in a quasi - uniform distribution of the macroparticles in the phase space . at this stage",
    "an ensemble of particles with random distribution is generated which occupies a fraction of the phase space .",
    "then this ensemble is copied on the other parts of the phase space to provide pseudo - uniform loading of the phase space .",
    "pseudo - uniformity means that initial microbunching at the fundamental harmonic ( or for several harmonics ) is equal to zero . also , phase positions of the mirrored particles are correlated such that microbunching does not appear due to betatron oscillations , or due to the energy spread .",
    "finally , artificial displacements of the macroparticles are applied to provide desired ( in our case gaussian ) statistics of microbunching at the undulator entrance .",
    "we note that it is not evident that such an artificial ensemble reflects actual physical situation for a short wavelength sase fel .",
    "let us consider an example of the sase fel operating at the radiation wavelength of 0.1  nm . with the peak current of 5  ka we find that the number of electrons per wavelength is about @xmath40 .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that properties of an artificial ensemble ( even at the first step of pseudo - uniform loading ) converge very slowly to the model of continuous media .",
    "in fact , even with the number of macroparticles per radiation wavelength @xmath41 the fel gain still visibly deviates from the target value . introducing of an artificial noise makes situation with the quality of an ensemble preparation even more problematic .",
    "the only way to test the quality of an artificial ensemble is to perform numerical simulations with actual number of electrons in the beam .",
    "we constructed such a version of three - dimensional , time - dependent fel simulation code fast @xcite .",
    "comparison of the results with direct simulations of the electron beam and with an artificial distributions has shown that artificial ensembles are not adequate to the problem .",
    "artificial effects are pronouncing especially when calculating such fine features as transverse correlation functions .",
    "thus , all the simulations presented in this paper have been performed with code fast using actual number of electrons in the beam .",
    "the result of each simulation run contains an array of complex amplitudes @xmath42 for electromagnetic fields on a three - dimensional mesh . at the next stage of the numerical experiment",
    "the data arrays are handled with postprocessor codes to calculate different characteristics of the radiation . however , as the first step it is worthwhile to obtain qualitative analysis of the object under study .",
