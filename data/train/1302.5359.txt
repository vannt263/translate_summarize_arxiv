    "cosmic rays ( crs ) interact with gas atoms during their propagation in the interstellar medium and can suffer significant energy losses , thus modifying their injection spectra and composition .",
    "in addition , the spectra of crs reaching the earth are affected by the solar wind and the by the solar magnetic field ( solar modulation effect ) . the solar modulation plays a relevant role on cr spectra in the low energy region , and its effect needs to be disentangled to allow a comprehensive picture to emerge . in fact , to understand the origin and propagation of crs , a knowledge of their energy spectra in the interstellar medium",
    "is required .",
    "precise measurements of cr spectra over a wide rigidity range , from a few hundred @xmath0 to tens of @xmath1 can be used to study the effect of solar modulation , including the convective and adiabatic cooling effect of the expanding solar wind and the diffusive and particle drift effects of the turbulent heliospheric magnetic field ( hmf ) .",
    "a full three - dimensional ( 3d ) model was developed to compute the differential intensity of cr protons from @xmath2 to @xmath3 at earth  @xcite , and was applied to give an interpretation of the pamela proton data sets collected from 2006 to 2009  @xcite .",
    "the model also includes a detailed treatment of the cr propagation in the solar magnetic field , that allows a precise description of the solar modulation effect .",
    "the implementation of this approach requires to provide the local interstellar proton spectrum ( lis ) as initial condition .",
    "the lis input spectrum is then `` modulated '' by the solar magnetic field , that affects the shape of the cr spectrum at earth .",
    "the choice of the lis has always been rather contentious ( see for instance @xcite ) , and its parametrization in terms of proton kinetic energy could be complex ( see for instance  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we assume some simple analytical lis models to fit the proton fluxes measured by the ams detector in june 1998  @xcite and by the pamela detector in different periods from 2006 to 2009 .",
    "the solar modulation effect is also described in a simple form , using the force - field approximation  @xcite .",
    "the simplest model describing cr acceleration is the first - order fermi mechanism , where particles gain energy by diffusing back and forth across a shock front while convecting downstream . in this framework ,",
    "the particle differential density per unit momentum @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "after injection into the interstellar medium with spectral index @xmath6 , characteristic of supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks , crs are transported in the astronomical environments with rigidity - dependent escape lengths , that soften their spectra by @xmath7 , leaving a steady - state cr particle momentum density @xmath8 , where @xmath9  @xcite .    ) . the top panel shows the fit results superimposed to the the data points .",

    "it is interesting to point out that both the ams and pamela data sets are well fitted by the momentum power law lis .",
    "moreover , the values of the lis parameters ( prefactor and spectral index ) obtained from the fit of the ams data are consistent with those obtained from the fits of the pamela data sets taken in 2006 , 2007 and 2008 , as one would expect since the lis is time independent . on the other hand , the fit of the data collected by pamela in 2009 yields values that differ significantly from those obtained from the other fits .",
    "because of the consistency between the ams and the first three pamela fits , we decided to combine these results into a unique lis , with a spectral index @xmath42 and a pre - factor of @xmath43 , evaluated from the weighted average of the individual fit results .",
    "using these parameters for the lis ( eq .  [ eqlis ] ) and leaving only the solar modulation potential free , the fits of the ams and of the pamela data do not change significantly with respect to the ones shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",

    "it is also worth to point out that , when this lis model is assumed , the solar modulation potential values are smaller with respect to those obtained assuming the simple momentum power law model .",
    "this feature is due to the shape of the lis given in eq .",

    "this constraint does not worsen the fit , and the the solar modulation potential values do not change significantly .    to reproduce the b / c ratio the injection spectrum of cr protons",
    "is often approximated with a power law in the rigidity space with a break at a few @xmath1(see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "a possible description of this feature can be given by choosing for the lis momentum density a broken power law function ( with a discontinuity in the first derivative at the break ) :    @xmath51    that result into a differential intensity given by :    @xmath52    with @xmath53 and @xmath14 .",

    "the simple power law model of the proton lis folded with the solar modulation in the force field approximation provides a good fit of the both ams and pamela proton data .",
    "this result needs to be investigated with further analyses , for instance by using data from helium and heavy nuclei on short time periods , that are not publicly available .    in general",
    ", it is worth to point out that a cr measurement at earth does not allow to easily reconstruct the lis , since the solar modulation effect can not be easily disentangled .",
