    "photonic crystals embedded in planar dielectric waveguides , also known as photonic crystal slabs , are intensively investigated as a promising route for the tailoring of photonic states.@xmath0 indeed , propagation of light can be controlled in these systems by the dielectric discontinuity of the slab waveguide in the vertical ( @xmath1 ) direction and by the photonic pattern in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "the geometry of a patterned waveguide gives considerable freedom in designing photonic structures ( periodic or containing defects ) that can be realized at near - infrared or optical wavelength by lithography and etching .",
    "most experimental investigations of photonic crystal slabs with a two - dimensional ( 2d ) or one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic lattice concern in - plane transmission@xcite or surface reflectance / transmittance measurements@xcite with the purpose of determining the photonic gaps and the band dispersion .",
    "structures containing defect states like linear waveguides in 2d lattices@xcite or microcavities in 1d systems@xcite are also being investigated . on the theoretical side , the study of photonic crystal slabs has been undertaken with plane - wave expansion,@xcite scattering - matrix methods,@xcite finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) calculations,@xcite modal methods,@xcite and perturbative approaches.@xcite recently , a finite - basis expansion method has been introduced.@xmath3 most of these papers concern 2d structures , either periodic or with linear defects . the theoretical study of 1d structures",
    "is restricted to a few papers and mostly focused onto the optical response in both in - plane@xcite and out - of - plane@xcite configurations .",
    "electromagnetic eigenmodes in photonic crystal ( pc ) slabs with a periodic pattern have notable differences as compared to the ideal reference systems ( i.e. , not waveguide - embedded ) , which are well known from the literature for the cases of both 1d@xcite and 2d@xcite periodicities .",
    "a most important issue is the _ light - line problem _ : only photonic modes which lie below the light line of the cladding material ( or materials , if the waveguide is asymmetric ) are truly guided and stationary , while those lying above the light line in the first brillouin zone are coupled to leaky waveguide modes and are subject to intrinsic radiative losses .",
    "these _ quasi - guided modes _",
    "are actually resonances in a region of continuous energy spectrum , and for this reason they are more difficult to calculate than truly guided modes below the light line .",
    "indeed , while the dispersion of guided modes can be obtained by a plane - wave expansion with a supercell in the vertical direction@xcite , the frequencies and especially the losses of quasi - guided modes are most commonly studied by fdtd calculations.@xcite another important feature of photonic crystal slabs is the blue shift of the eigenmodes due to vertical confinement in the planar waveguide .",
    "this effect , which is more pronounced for slabs with strong out - of - plane refractive index contrast , implies that the frequencies of photonic bands and gaps depend on all parameters of the planar waveguide ( layer thicknesses and refractive indices ) and can differ substantially from those of the reference 1d or 2d system .",
    "finally , the eigenmodes of photonic crystal slabs can be put in one - to - one correspondence with those of the reference system only when the frequency is sufficiently low for the waveguide to be monomode .",
    "the cut - off frequency of second- and higher - order modes also depends on slab parameters and on the photonic lattice .",

    "these are defined in two types of waveguides with strong refractive index contrast : the self - standing membrane or _ air bridge _ ( fig .",
    "[ structure]b ) and the asymmetric photonic crystal slab in which only the core layer is patterned ( fig .",
    "[ structure]c ) .",
    "the latter structure is typically realized with the silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) system but may also be realized with gaas on an oxide layer .",
    "we assume the following values of the dielectric constants : @xmath7 for the high - index core layer ( as appropriate to si or gaas below the band gap ) , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 ( as appropriate for sio@xmath12 or other oxides ) .",
    "the periodic patterning is taken along the @xmath13 direction and throughout this paper we assume @xmath14 .",
    "the gap maps are calculated as a function of air fraction in the core layer and for different values of the core thickness , thereby exploring a wide range of parameters of experimental interest .",
    "the dependence of the radiation losses on frequency , polarization , and air fraction is also calculated and discussed .",
    "the photonic bands and gap maps of a distributed bragg reflector are obviously well known and are exemplified in fig .",

    "[ ideal]a ( which refer to an air fraction @xmath10 ) as well as the gap map of fig .",
    "[ ideal]b are degenerate for transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarizations with respect to the plane of incidence : this degeneracy is lifted in a waveguide because the confinement - induced shift is polarization - dependent , as was already shown experimentally.@xcite one of the goals of the present paper is to establish whether a complete band gap for both polarizations can occur in a waveguide - embedded 1d photonic structure .",
    "related concepts have been studied in the context of dielectric waveguide gratings , also called resonant grating filters.@xmath15 these kinds of diffraction gratings may support guided and leaky modes .",
    "the latter are resonantly coupled to an external light beam and give rise to narrow resonances in reflection or transmission , which may be used for polarization - dependent filters@xcite or for enhanced nonlinear optical effects.@xcite most of the research concentrated on systems with a weak dielectric modulation , e.g. , surface relief gratings for filtering and distributed feedback,@xcite waveguides with a weak refractive index contrast within the core region@xcite and/or which are modeled by a single fourier component of the dielectric function.@xmath16 for an extensive list of previous literature along these lines and of the different kinds of theoretical methods used we refer to the book by loewen and popov.@xcite in all these cases , which can be treated at least qualitatively by coupled - mode theory , the dispersion of the waveguide mode is only weakly modified by the dielectric modulation and photonic bandgap effects are very small .",
    "specific waveguide grating structures with strong refractive index modulation in the plane leading to an appreciable photonic gap have been studied in refs .   for the case of te polarization , and in refs .   for both te and tm polarizations . in these strongly modulated cases",
    "a rigorous coupled - wave analysis ( also called the fourier modal method ) is necessary and has been used .",
    "we point out that the focus of the present work is quite different from all these papers , in particular for what concerns the systematic calculation of gap maps and losses as a function of frequency and of various structure parameters .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a short description of the theoretical method for calculating photonic bands and intrinsic losses in a waveguide . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss a few examples of photonic mode dispersion , both for symmetric and asymmetric 1d photonic crystal slabs .",
    "section iv contains detailed results for 1d gap maps in a membrane or in an asymmetric waveguide for different values of the core thickness . in sec .",
    "v we present results for intrinsic losses of quasi - guided modes . in sec .",
    "vi we give a few closing remarks .",
    "the approach adopted here , which was already introduced in refs .  , relies on a finite - basis expansion in order to transform the second - order equation for the magnetic field in a linear eigenvalue problem .",
    "the basis consists of the guided modes of an effective homogeneous waveguide , where the dielectric constant of each layer is defined by the spatial average of the dielectric constant @xmath17 over the photonic pattern .",
    "the in - plane bloch vector @xmath18 is obviously conserved modulo a reciprocal lattice vector @xmath19 .",
    "the off - diagonal components @xmath20 of the dielectric tensor give rise to band splittings and to a folding of the photonic modes in the first brillouin zone .",
    "some of the photonic modes may lie below the cladding light line and be truly guided , however most ( sometimes all ) of them fall above the light line in the first brillouin zone .",
    "coupling of these modes to leaky modes of the effective waveguide is taken into account by time - dependent perturbation theory , which leads to an expression for the imaginary part of the mode frequency in terms of the photonic density of states at fixed in - plane wavevector.@xcite this procedure is formally analogous to fermi s golden rule in quantum mechanics . when the waveguide is asymmetric ( like in the case of the soi structure )",
    ", care must be taken to express the leaky modes in terms of outgoing states and to relate them to the respective state densities.@xcite    the approximations made in the present approach are as follows ( for a fuller discussion see refs .  ) .",
    "the effective dielectric constant of the homogeneous waveguide , which defines the basis of guided modes for the expansion , is chosen to be @xmath21 for both te and tm polarizations .",
    "this choice is by no means unique , although it is the exact definition of the effective dielectric constant for te polarization and anyway when the electric field is perpendicular to the direction of periodicity.@xcite for tm - polarized modes , which have electric field components along @xmath13 and @xmath1 , the situation is more complex.@xcite it is known from the literature that the @xmath13 component of the electric field is subject to an effective dielectric constant that is obtained from the inverse averaging rule,@xcite therefore a different choice of @xmath22 in the patterned region could be suggested for tm modes .",
    "choices of @xmath22 differing from eq .",
    "( [ media ] ) do not lead to any appreciable change of the results above the mode cutoff , as we have verified .",
    "the frequency position of the cutoff does depend on the choice of @xmath22 , especially for large air fractions , however a comparison with exact scattering matrix calculations  @xcite shows that the average dielectric constant defined by eq .",
    "( [ media ] ) gives very good agreement with the frequencies and cutoff positions obtained from the exact calculations .",
    "it should also be noted that the electromagnetic field close to mode cutoff is mostly extended in the claddings , where the dielectric constants are homogeneous for the airbridge and soi structures studied in the present paper .",
    "the number of reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath19 is limited by a finite cut - off , like for usual plane - wave calculations,@xcite and in addition a restricted number of guided modes of the effective waveguide is kept in the expansion . for the calculations shown in this work ,",
    "a number of 31 plane waves is usually taken in the basis set and is sufficient for convergence with better than percent accuracy .",
    "the number of guided modes in the expansion is not found to be critical in the energy range considered and is usually taken to be @xmath23 .",
    "for the quasi - guided modes , neglect of the second - order shift due to coupling to leaky modes introduces an error of less than a few percent in the photonic frequencies .",
    "all these approximations are justified _ a posteriori _ by the close agreement of the calculated photonic frequencies with those obtained from reflectivity calculations@xcite made with the exact scattering - matrix method.@xcite finally , calculating the radiative losses of quasi - guided modes by first - order perturbation theory is justified by the fact that the imaginary part of the frequency is much smaller than the real part , as shown by the results below .",

    "the bands are plotted by using dimensionless frequency @xmath26 as a function of in - plane wave vector @xmath27 in the first brillouin zone .",

    "the dispersion for the average dielectric slab is presented in the reduced zone scheme , allowing for a direct comparison with the corresponding photonic bands of the patterned waveguide .",
    "we have classified the guided modes according to mirror symmetry with respect to the plane of incidence @xmath29 ( we use @xmath30 to denote this operation ) and with respect to the @xmath2 plane ( @xmath31 operation ) .",
    "the modes whose electric field component lies in the @xmath2 plane are referred to as te , and are odd with respect to specular reflection through the plane of incidence ( @xmath32 ) ; the modes whose magnetic field lies in the @xmath2 plane are labelled as tm and are even with respect to mirror plane @xmath33 ( @xmath34).@xcite these modes can be classified further as even ( @xmath35 ) or odd ( @xmath36 ) with respect to specular reflection through the @xmath2 plane , thus giving four different types of guided eigenfunctions for the electromagnetic field .",
    "we can separately compare fig .",
    "[ bandair]a to [ bandair]b and fig .",
    "[ bandair]c to [ bandair]d .",
    "it is clearly seen that for both te and tm modes the periodic patterning of the dielectric slab introduces band gaps around the degenerate points of the average slab dispersion curves ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , owing to the off - diagonal components of the inverse dielectric tensor .",
    "there is one - to - one correspondence between average slab and 1d pc slab modes .",
    "the first - order modes ( te even and tm odd ) have no cut - off frequency , as is well known for a symmetric waveguide .",

    "the first photonic band gap appears between 0.15 and 0.20 in the ideal 1d case , and between 0.22 and 0.28 for the lowest te mode in the pc slab , due to the confinement effect along the vertical ( @xmath1 ) direction .",
    "the gap between the first and the second band opens between 0.37 and 0.45 when considering tm modes : these values are strongly blue shifted with respect to both the multilayer and the te modes of the pc slab .",
    "thus the confinement effect manifests itself in the blue shift of the eigenfrequencies of the electromagnetic field with respect to the ideal multilayer , and moreover in the removal of degeneracy between te and tm modes : the latter effect is due to the stronger confinement of tm compared to te modes in the planar waveguide.@xcite we also notice that all the band gaps , except for the first one , lie in the region of guided resonances , and could be experimentally tested by external reflectance measurements .",
    "the first band gap , either te even or tm odd , is instead in the region of truly guided modes .",
    "a complete band gap common to both polarizations can also be seen around @xmath41 , where the second - order te gap overlaps the first - order tm gap .",

    "it is important to stress that the modes lying between the two claddings light lines ( oxide and air in this case ) are evanescent in air , but leaky in the substrate .",
    "these modes have finite radiative losses , as we will see in section  [ losses ] .",

    "the gap map is more complex for @xmath39 , due to the appearence of higher - order waveguide modes at low frequency .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath48 the slab is still monomode , and a large complete band gap opens in a wide range of air fractions ( fig .",

    "the band gap in tm modes is still present around @xmath51 , but no complete band gap exists because of the presence of second - order te modes .",
    "the conclusions from these results are the following : ( i ) the te gap map in a waveguide resembles the ideal 1d one only below the cut - off of second - order modes , ( ii ) the tm gap map is very sensitive to the structure parameters , and ( iii ) a complete gap for both polarizations is calculated to occur only for a core thickness around @xmath39 .      in fig .",

    "notice that the losses vary in a logarithmic scale and become extremely small either towards the homogeneous waveguide limit at low air fraction or close to the brillouin zone edge . while the filling fraction dependence of the losses is similar for all bands and polarizations , the wavevector dependence changes from band to band , as it appears from figs .",

    "it can be concluded that for the present waveguide - embedded 1d photonic structures , the spectral linewidth of quasi - guided photonic modes can vary by several orders of magnitude and it depends in a nontrivial way on the structure parameters as well as on the angle of incidence , mode index , and polarization .",
    "we have studied the photonic bands and the gap maps of one - dimensional photonic crystal slabs made of a high refractive index material sandwiched between low index claddings , thus providing strong confinement of electromagnetic waves along the vertical direction .",
    "the method adopted yields the frequencies of photonic modes both below and above the light line , and therefore allows treating guided and quasi - guided modes on the same footing .",
    "photonic modes in a 1d photonic crystal waveguide can be put in one - to - one correspondence with those of the ideal 1d reference system only when the waveguide is monomode . under this condition ,",
    "the te gap maps are qualitatively similar to the ideal 1d ones considering the blue shift in the waveguide .",
    "this confinement effect is considerably more pronounced for tm - polarized than for te - polarized modes , thereby leading to a polarization splitting which depends in a sensitive way on the structure parameters . as a consequence , a complete band gap common to te and",

    "the radiative losses of guided resonances due to out - of - plane diffraction depend in a sensitive way on waveguide parameters , mode index , and frequency . for some modes",
    "the imaginary part of the frequency vanishes at the brillouin zone center , thus even above the light line it is possible to find photonic modes with very low losses . in general , the losses are predicted to be higher for silicon - on - insulator structures as compared to photonic crystal membranes , due to the asymmetry of the planar waveguide .",
    "all these results are related to the presence of diffraction channels for radiative couplings .",

    "the perturbative treatment of the coupling to radiative modes is analogous to that introduced by ochiai and sakoda @xcite , however in the present method the dielectric modulation described by the tensor @xmath20 is treated exactly , thereby going beyond the nearly - free - photon approximation of ref .  .",
