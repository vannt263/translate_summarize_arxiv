    "it was shown that one - particle model mentioned above does not describe the total @xmath1 transition probability as well as the channel corresponding to absorption of the @xmath3-particle .    in a resent paper [ 10 ]",

    "( we would like to emphasize this fact . )",
    "the direct calculation by means of evolution operator gives the distribution ( 22 ) .",
    "the more physical explanation of the @xmath135-dependence is as follows . in the hamiltonian ( 2 ) corresponding to fig .",

    "the first vertex determines the time - dependence of the whole process at least for small @xmath17 .",
    "( see , however , text below ( 22 ) . )",
    "we also recall that even for proton decay the possibility of non - exponential behavior is realistic [ 19 - 22 ] .    in fig .",

    "the diagram 2c is described by the exponential decay law as well .    ratio ( 23 ) does not depend on @xmath23 , whereas @xmath142 contains two unknown parameters @xmath23 and @xmath59 and so the contribution of diagrams 1a and 2b can not be compared numerically . nevertheless , it is safe to argue that for sufficiently large times @xmath143 because @xmath144 , whereas @xmath145 .",

    "1a is quadratic in time : @xmath127 ( see , however , text below ( 22 ) ) .",
    "this is due to the zero momentum transfer in the @xmath0 transition vertex .",
    "the point @xmath55 is the peculiar point of the @xmath19-matrix amplitude .",
    "if the amplitude is singular , the surprises can be expected . from this standpoint",
    "a departure from the exponential decay law comes as no surprise to us .",
    "it seems natural that for non - singular and singular diagrams the functional structure of the results is different , including @xmath149-dependence .",
    "the opposite situation would be strange .    to summarize , the diagrams 1a and 2 are fundamentally different .",
    "the time - dependence of the corresponding processes is different as well .",
