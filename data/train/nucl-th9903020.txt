    "traditionally three - nucleon scattering calculations are carried out by solving faddeev equations in a partial wave truncated basis .",
    "a partial wave decomposition replaces the continuous angle variables by discrete orbital angular momentum quantum numbers , and thus reduces the number of continuous variables , which have to be discretized in a numerical treatment . for low projectile energies",
    "the procedure of considering orbital angular momentum components appears physically justified due to arguments related to the centrifugal barrier .",
    "however , the algebraic and algorithmic steps to be carried out in a partial wave decomposition can be quite involved when solving the faddeev equations .",
    "if one considers three - nucleon scattering at a few hundred mev projectile energy , the number of partial waves needed to achieve convergence proliferates , and limitations with respect to computational feasibility and accuracy are reached .",
    "the amplitudes acquire stronger angular dependence , which is already visible in the two - nucleon amplitudes , and their formation by an increasing number of partial waves not only becomes more tedious but also less informative .",
    "the method of partial wave decomposition looses its physical transparency , and the direct use of angular variables becomes more appealing .",
    "it appears therefore natural to avoid a partial wave representation completely and work directly with vector variables .",
    "this is common practice in bound state calculations of few - nucleon systems based on variational @xcite and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) methods @xcite , which are carried out in configuration space .",
    "our aim is to work directly with vector variables in the faddeev scheme in momentum space . in @xcite",
    "we demonstrated for malfliet - tjon type potentials that the two - body lippmann - schwinger equation can readily be solved in momentum space as function of vector momenta . at intermediate energies",
    "the strong forward peaking of the @xmath0-matrix was quite easily achieved through the angular variable but required relatively many partial wave contributions .",
    "the choice of momentum vectors as adequate variables is also suggested by the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force . here",
    "the dependence on momentum vectors can be rather simple , e.g. in the widely used one - boson - exchange force , whereas the partial wave representation of this force leads to rather complicated expressions @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the bound state faddeev equation has a rather transparent structure when formulated with vector variables compared to the coupled set of two - dimensional integral equations obtained in a partial wave decomposed form . based on malfliet - tjon type interactions",
    "it was demonstrated that the numerical solution of the bound state equation using vector variables is straightforward and numerically very accurate .    in this article",
    "we want to show that the solution of the three - body scattering equation can also be obtained in a straightforward manner when employing vector variables , i.e. magnitudes of momenta and angles between the momentum vectors . in this work we concentrate on scattering below the three - body breakup threshold .",
    "though we avoid the singularity of the free three - body propagator , we already encounter the two - body fragmentation cut related to the pole in the two - body @xmath0-matrix . as a further simplification we neglect spin and iso - spin degrees of freedom and treat three - boson scattering .",
    "the interactions employed are of yukawa type , and no separable approximations are involved .",
    "the faddeev equation for three identical bosons is solved exactly as function of momentum vectors . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first time such an approach is carried out .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes our choice of momentum and angle variables for the unknown amplitude in the faddeev equation and the integral kernel of that equation .",
    "the calculation of the only scattering observable , the differential cross section is also derived . in section iiia",
    "we discuss details of our algorithms and numerical procedures and present our results .",
    "in addition properties of the faddeev amplitude are displayed . in section",
    "iv we discuss an alternative choice of variables and demonstrate that this choice leads to the same result as the choice of section ii .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "we solve the faddeev equations for three identical particles in the form    @xmath1    where @xmath0 is the two - body @xmath0-matrix defined in the subsystem and the operator @xmath2 is the sum of a cyclic and a anticyclic permutation of three objects .",
