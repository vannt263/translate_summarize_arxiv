    "highly extended supergravity theories have long been seen as potential theories of quantum gravity although they were displaced by superstring theories @xcite as favored candidates for a `` final theory '' .",
    "the ( quantum ) m theory has 10 dimensional supergravities as low energy limits and might be thought of either as a ( non - perturbative ) quantum version of eleven dimensional supergravity ( including its extended solutions ) or as a non - perturbative completion of superstring theories .",
    "the spectacular perturbative ultra - violet finiteness of string theories indicates that strings provide a physical regulator of supergravities in 10 dimensions . in this paper",
    "we shall explore the ultra - violet behavior of @xmath13 supergravity and its dimensional descendants from a field theory viewpoint . in this",
    "we are attempting to `` work - up '' to the quantum theory of gravity rather than work down from string theory .",
    "of the extended supergravities two play a central role .",
    "firstly , there is the @xmath14 , @xmath1 maximally extended theory @xcite which reduces to @xmath15 in @xmath16 @xcite . in some ways",
    "this theory is the ultimate conventional point - particle field theory .",
    "the one - loop amplitude is potentially infinite for @xmath17 although in dimensional regularisation it is only infinite for @xmath2 ( in the dimensional regularisation prescription one - loop amplitudes in odd dimensions are finite and the @xmath0 infinity vanishes onshell ) .",
    "we shall work entirely within the dimensional reduction scheme this being the most appropriate to study an anomaly - free supersymmetric theory .    at two - loops infinities",
    "have been calculated in the amplitudes for @xmath18  @xcite ( including the @xmath14 case .",
    "the eleven dimensional counterterm was subsequently evaluated in ref .",
    "the expectation is that this theory will be perturbatively infinite in four dimensions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall examine features of the other interesting extended supergravity .",
    "this is the @xmath0 , @xmath1 theory and its dimensional reduction descendants which include the @xmath16 , @xmath19 supergravity theory ( with a specific matter content ) .",
    "this supergravity is the gravitational sector of the low energy limit of both type  i and heterotic string theories @xcite .",
    "for the one - loop amplitudes we may consider the @xmath13 supergravity together with arbitrary matter multiplets , although having less supersymmetry than the @xmath20 theory , it is not clear which is the most fundamental .",
    "a web of dualities relates the various string theories and if one introduces for instance the appropriate gauge group so(32 ) in the type i matter sector , this choice cancels the gravitational and gauge anomalies .",
    "when compactified to @xmath21 type i and type ii theories give rise to very special and similar symmetry groups .",
    "in fact it can be argued that these duality symmetries that have gained importance together with the realisation of the overwhelming necessity of non - perturbative effects are not that different between type i and type ii supergravities .",
    "the tantalizing @xmath22 is closely related to the hyperbolic kac - moody algebra obtained from the extrapolation of the chamseddine - sen sequence @xcite namely the hyperbolic extension of @xmath23 .",
    "in fact the symmetry groups of type i are fixed point sets under an involution of those of type ii for all dimensions ( at least three ) ; this was mentioned in @xcite and relies on kac s description of the automorphisms of simple lie algebras which can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "clearly , the extended supergravities can only be uv finite if they possess symmetries which we do not fully understand yet , the implications of which will be at the non - perturbative level , or at least will require novel renormalisation techniques . consequently ,",
    "if these symmetries are operative at all , they should be approximately as powerful for type i and ii theories .",
    "and one could infer from this that the structure of divergences should be somehow related in both theories which are two dual perturbative expansions .",
    "one should keep in mind though that the relation is nonperturbative .",
    "the explicit ( perturbative ) calculation we shall perform is four graviton scattering at one - loop for @xmath24 .",
    "this will enable us to evaluate @xmath25 counterterms .",
    "for the one - loop amplitudes we may consider the @xmath26 supergravity multiplet with arbitrary matter , we shall call it type i slightly abusively . although the theory will only be free from gravitational anomalies in @xmath0 for special gauge groups , for @xmath27 the gravitational anomalies only manifest themselves in the five or six graviton amplitude .",
    "furthermore the contribution is parity odd and finite whereas we shall consider divergences .    before calculating the counterterms",
    ", we shall calculate the entire amplitudes ( including their finite part ) and at first for a particular choice of external helicities - namely in the case where the external polarisation vectors are forced to be four dimensional . with this simplification it is possible to present the amplitude in a very elegant form as the sum over a few simple integral functions .",
    "from these amplitudes we can easily see the presence of ultra - violet infinities in @xmath27 .",
    "unlike the situation in four dimensions , there are onshell independent @xmath25 tensors in dimension @xmath28 , so in @xmath2 the counterterms are not determined by single coefficients and it requires a full computation of the amplitude to fix their form .",
    "we find a beautiful factorisation of the infinite counterterms in the amplitude into a product of left times right kinematic factors in a manner very reminiscent of the relationships between gravity and yang - mills presented in ref .",
    "the factorisation can be understood from a string theory viewpoint but remains more obscure for field theorists .",
    "offshell this factorisation is also not obvious at all from examining the field theory counterterms although the counterterms can be manipulated to reflect it .",
    "as a simple case , we first study amplitudes where the helicity of the external gravitons are restricted to lie in the four - dimensional space defined by the momenta .",
    "in this situation we can calculate the entire amplitude in a fairly simple form by breaking the amplitude into its helicity components .",
    "even with the external helicities specified there are different contributions depending upon which supermultiplet is circulating in the internal loop .",
    "one may label the possible loop contributions according to the circulating four dimensional supermultiplets .",
    "the three contributions we shall distinguish are that from a @xmath15 multiplet , that from a @xmath30 matter multiplet and finally that from a @xmath19 matter multiplet . in terms of these contributions the ( pure ) @xmath19 supergravity one - loop amplitude is @xmath31 also , of more interest to us is the `` @xmath32 '' one - loop amplitude for the dimensional reduction of @xmath33 supergravity to four dimensions which is @xmath34 it is often the case that nonmaximally supersymmetric theories do not remain irreducible upon dimensional reduction . if we consider the @xmath35 ( or type i ) supergravity coupled to @xmath19 super - yang - mills matter the corresponding amplitude is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the dimension of the gauge group .",
    "let us call @xmath38 the combination @xmath39 .",
    "we have chosen to organize our amplitudes conveniently as linear combinations of the three supermultiplet contributions .",
    "for @xmath0 the three independent supersymmetric contributions are for instance the @xmath15 and the @xmath32 contributions as well as the `` matter '' @xmath19 term .",
    "these have in turn reductions below 10 dimensions .",
    "if the external polarisations are forced to be four dimensional then the external gravitons have @xmath40 helicity .",
    "there are then only three independent `` helicity amplitudes '' , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "( we choose a convention where all particles are considered outgoing . ) in any supersymmetric theory , @xmath44 and the only non - zero independent amplitude is @xmath43 .",

    "as is explained in detail in appendix  c we may choose to express the counterterms in terms of the following set of tensors , @xmath143 for @xmath144 to @xmath145 the derivatives are contracted with each other and these @xmath146 s are related to derivatives acting upon the @xmath147 s of the previous sections .",
    "tensors @xmath148 and @xmath149 however have the derivatives contracted into the riemann tensors .",

    "in fact it is possible to express both tensors in the form @xmath153 where we have chosen to contract the derivatives into the @xmath154 tensor .",
    "the specific tensors are @xmath155 where possible one must antisymmetrise with respect to the pairs of indices @xmath156 etc and symmetrise with respect to pairs of couples of indices @xmath157 .",

    "the counterterms for @xmath26 supergravities are given by linear combinations of the various @xmath160 and in fact the infinities are given by @xmath161 since the various infinities factorise in this way .",
    "at the level of the counterterms , all type i supergravity divergences contain the factor @xmath69 .",
    "in this letter we have determined the one - loop ultra - violet behavior of the dimensional reductions of @xmath13 supergravity .",
    "we have examined this by calculations involving physical on - shell ( four - point ) amplitudes . we have found a variety of results ; some in complete agreement with expectations but some not so obvious from the field theory viewpoint . as expected , the amplitudes are one - loop finite for @xmath162 . for @xmath163 there is a richer structure . in @xmath2",
    "we find infinities which correspond to @xmath25 counterterms and we have completely determined the @xmath25 structure . in @xmath16",
    "the structure of @xmath25 terms is fairly simple ; there are only two independent tensors of which one is compatible with supersymmetry - the well known `` bel - robinson '' combination  @xcite . for @xmath28 , there are seven independent tensors . for the @xmath164 theory supersymmetry",
    "is less restrictive than for @xmath165 and this allows a further @xmath25 counterterm , in fact we do find infinities belonging to a new tensor structure .    within dimensional regularisation , @xmath0 counterterms",
    "to a four - point infinity are of the form @xmath130 .",
    "the vanishing of the @xmath0 , @xmath166 one - loop infinity is presumably due to the non - existence of a supersymmetric combination of @xmath130 counterterms ( which does not vanish onshell . ) for @xmath26 we do however find a @xmath130 counterterm which is non - zero .",
    "an interesting feature of the amplitudes ( so far checked up to 1-loop level ) is _",
    "factorisation_. for the @xmath2 counterterms one finds that the infinities in the amplitude factorise as @xmath167 where the @xmath168 are combinations of the external @xmath169 and @xmath52 .",

    "this factorisation is far from manifest when examining the counterterms however .",
    "regarding the amplitudes as arising from the low energy limit of string theory , this factorisation is the remnant of the string factorisation into left and right moving amplitudes .",
    "however , it should be noted that the string factorisation occurs _ within _ the loop momentum integral whereas the factorisation of infinity occurs in the amplitude .",
    "the factorisation is expected whenever the tree corrections generate the same invariants .",
    "however the factorisation of the amplitudes is unexpected from a field theory viewpoint and is hinting towards an alternate description of gravity theories as a product of two yang - mills theories - as suggested in @xcite .",
    "although such a formalism is natural in string theory it might well exist in a purely field theoretic context .",
    "the counterterm structures we find are related to terms appearing in various places in string theory .",
    "this is not surprising since string theory provides a physical regularisation of supergravity .",

    "however we wish to emphasize that the philosophy underlying our work is not to go from superstring theory `` downwards '' , that is to study supergravity as its effective low energy theory , but on the contrary to move from field theory `` upwards '' and to study its effective action within a qft framework , using dimensional reduction as a regularisation scheme , instead of string theory .",
    "from the field theory point of view the observed factorization is a highly non trivial result , consistent with the interpretation of the supergravities with @xmath337 and @xmath338 supercharges as low energy theories of type ii and heterotic superstring theories respectively .",
    "in particular the different forms of the counterterms in the maximal and non maximal cases may be related , in this perspective , to different supersymmetry constraints holding on the two sectors of the closed string theory .",
    "more specifically our results seem to suggest that in an open string sector the only possible invariants in four @xmath303 consistent with an @xmath1 supersymmetry have to be constructed by saturating the indices of the field strengths with a @xmath69 tensor .",
    "this condition would restrict the possible invariants ( non vanishing on  shell ) in four @xmath303 and at most two derivatives , to just one possibility , namely @xmath339 .",
    "indeed if we interpret the maximal supergravity as the low energy limit of type ii superstring , which has an @xmath1 supersymmetry on both the ( l ) and ( r ) sectors , according to the above positions the only on  shell non vanishing counterterm is the one found in @xmath2 ( with no derivatives ) , which is indeed proportional to @xmath340 .",
    "as far as the theory with @xmath338 supercharges is concerned , it may be interpreted as the low energy effective theory of the heterotic superstring , which has an @xmath1 supersymmetry on one sector ( l ) and an @xmath341 on the other ( r ) .",
    "again , consistently with our results and the above considerations , we can associate the @xmath90 factor of the corresponding counterterms in @xmath2 and @xmath0 with the sector ( l ) constrained by supersymmetry .",
