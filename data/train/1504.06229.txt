    "<S> the wake flow around a circular cylinder at @xmath0 performing rotatory oscillations has been thoroughly discussed in the literature , mostly focusing on the modifications to the natural bnard - von krmn vortex street that result from the forced shedding modes locked to the rotatory oscillation frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the usual experimental and theoretical frameworks at these reynolds numbers are quasi - two - dimensional , since the secondary instabilities bringing a three - dimensional structure to the cylinder wake flow occur only at higher reynolds numbers . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that a three - dimensional structure can appear below the usual three - dimensionalization threshold , when forcing with frequencies lower than the natural vortex shedding frequency , at high amplitudes , as a result of a previously unreported mechanism : a pulsed centrifugal instability of the oscillating stokes layer at the wall of the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> the present numerical investigation lets us in this way propose a physical explanation for the turbulence - like features reported in the recent experimental study of @xcite . </S>"
