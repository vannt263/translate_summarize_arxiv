    "the necessary improvement coefficient @xmath5 is now known also for the wilson gauge action with @xmath6 flavors of dynamical wilson fermions ( action `` w / sw '' ) @xcite and with the iwasaki gauge action with @xmath7 ( i / sw ) @xcite .",

    "we report on @xmath8 effects with dynamical fermions , for w / sw and i / sw actions and for comparison we consider also the original wilson ( w / w ) and kogut susskind ( w / ks ) actions .",

    "however for @xmath6 it is more than a factor two larger ( ) and , although not shown here , this roughly holds also for other such mass differences . considering several other differences , we convinced ourselves that the only perturbatively known value for @xmath26 is not the origin of the large cutoff effects seen for w / sw and @xmath6 .",
    "we then considered the iwasaki gauge action together with the values of @xmath5 used in @xcite .",
    "we found a _ much _ smaller @xmath24 , see .",
    "in lattice gauge theory computations , the dependence of @xmath0 on the mass(es ) of the dynamical quarks has been neglected so far . however , in contrast to the @xmath27 force at very short distance @xmath28 where only an effect of relative size @xmath29 is present , for the force at @xmath30 this dependence is not obviously that small .",

    "a mass independent renormalization scheme has to be chosen . in perturbation theory",
    "an example is provided by the lattice minimal subtraction scheme with renormalized coupling [ e_glat ] ^2 _ ( ) & = & z_g(,a ) ^2 + & = & \\{1 -2b_0 ( a ) ^2 +  } ^2 .",
    "the above equation shows that the lattice spacing is fixed by @xmath31 , independently of the quark mass .",
    "apart from a small @xmath4-correction in @xmath4-improved qcd , which is due to @xcite ^2 = ( 1+a)g_0 ^ 2,=(g_0 ^ 2 ) , the lattice spacing is determined by @xmath32 alone in a mass - independent renormalization scheme .",
    "we note in passing that it is also mandatory to choose such a scheme in a comparison of lattice qcd results with chiral perturbation theory predictions .    to define the mass - dependence , we first introduce a reference value @xmath33 of the quark mass via @xmath34 , which we later put to @xmath35 in our numerical evaluation .",
    "other choices are possible .",
    "the physical mass dependence of @xmath0 may then be described by the function @xmath36 where @xmath37 is finite since in the corresponding renormalized ratio the common @xmath38-factor ( defined in the massless scheme ) cancels . a precise definition of @xmath39 is provided by ( @xmath40 ) _",

    "in practice only @xmath32 could be kept constant in our evaluation of @xmath43 , assuming that the @xmath44 term is negligible ( @xmath45 for w / sw @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath43 is well represented by the taylor expansion r(x,1/_0 ( ) ) = 1 + s(1/_0 ( ) ) ( x-1 ) for the data considered @xcite , namely & & x , _ 0 ( ) + & & x , _ 0 ( ) 4.6 + & & x , _ 0 ( ) 4.8 + & & x , _ 0 ( ) our figure shows the available results for the slope @xmath46 .",
    "both the i / sw numbers and the w / ks ones point to a very small @xmath47 in the continuum limit with a rather strong @xmath3-dependence and unclear mutual consistency .",
    "the two other actions appear to show even larger cutoff effects at @xmath48 .    .",
    "our results are not easy to interpret , apart from the general observation that dynamical fermions may introduce significant cutoff effects at @xmath49 .",
    "we recall some other findings .",
    "the jlqcd collaboration found a phase transition with @xmath7 w / sw @xcite , preventing simulations unless @xmath3 is quite small .",
    "these hints lead us to the conjecture that for @xmath6 , w / sw , @xmath48 , one may be close to a phase transition and thus suffer from cutoff effects which are not necessarily described by the symanzik expansion . concerning the pcac masses ( see section 2 ) , i / sw is much better .",
    "however , we are lacking an understanding why this is so and our figure shows significant @xmath3-effects in the mass dependence of @xmath0 for i / sw .    at the present time we draw two * conclusions*. + 1 ) the issue of what is a good action for full lattice qcd deserves more attention and one should investigate scaling properties of actions which are used to compute physical observables .",
    "+ 2 ) the mass dependence of @xmath0 and in particular the lattice artifacts contained in this mass dependence has to be understood before drawing conclusions on the chiral behavior of quantities such as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
