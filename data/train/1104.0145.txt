    "the theory of copulas provides a relevant tool to build multivariate probability laws , from fixed margins and required degree of dependence . from sklar s theorem  @xcite ,",
    "the dependence properties of a continuous multivariate distribution @xmath0 can be entirely summarized , independently of its margins , by a copula , uniquely associated with @xmath0 .",
    "several families of copulas , such as archimedian copulas  @xcite or copulas with polynomial sections  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "more recently , we proposed to give up the polynomial form to work with a semiparametric family of copulas  @xcite .",
    "this permits to increase the dependence degree and to preserve the dependence properties of copulas with polynomial sections without significantly complexifying the model .",
    "furthermore , the family of copulas is generated as simply as archimedian copulas , that is by an univariate function .",
    "+ among the numerous papers dedicated to the construction of copulas , very few of them propose some associated inference procedures . besides , starting from data , it is very difficult to find `` which copula is the right one ? '' , see  @xcite for a review on this problem in the financial modeling context .",
    "the first attempt to estimate copulas is achieved in  @xcite with the introduction of nonparametric estimates based on empirical copulas . a recent contribution to the nonparametric estimation of copula for time",
    "series is presented in  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to choose a parametric family of copulas and to estimate the parameters by a maximum likelihood method  @xcite .",
    "both approaches suffer from their own drawbacks . in the first case ,",
    "a fully nonparametric estimate is likely to suffer from the so - called `` curse of dimensionality '' .",
    "it would have a high variance for large number of margins and moderate size of datasets .",
    "at the opposite , a parametric estimate can lead to a very high bias if the prior family of copulas is not appropriate . restricting to archimedian copulas ,",
    "genest & rivest  @xcite proposed a semiparametric estimate . in this family , estimating the copula reduces to estimating the generating function .",
    "it is therefore realistic to consider a nonparametric estimate of this univariate function . here ,",
    "we show that , similarly , the estimation of a copula in the semiparametric family  @xcite can be simply achieved by estimating nonparametrically the univariate generating function .",
    "this permits to overcome the curse of dimensionality .",
    "we deduce of this estimator some statistical procedures for estimating the associated dependence coefficients and high probability regions .",
    "+ in section  [ secdef ] , the expression of the considered semiparametric family of copulas is given and its basic properties are recalled .",
    "section  [ estiphi ] is dedicated to the estimation of the generating function and of the dependence coefficients . in section  [ estiregions ] , we address the problem of estimating high probability regions .",

    "throughout this paper , we note @xmath1 $ ] . a bivariate copula defined on the unit",
    "square @xmath2 is a bivariate cumulative distribution function with univariate uniform @xmath3 margins .",
    "equivalently , it must satisfy the following properties :    ( p1 ) : :    @xmath4 , @xmath5 , ( p2 ) : :    @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,    @xmath5 , ( p3 ) : :    @xmath8 ,    @xmath9 , such that    @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "we consider the semiparametric family of functions defined on @xmath2 by : @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a function on @xmath3 .",
    "this family was first introduced in  @xcite , chapter 3 , and is a particular case of farlie s family  @xcite .",
    "it is extensively studied in  @xcite . in particular , the following basic lemma is proved :    [ lemprinc ] @xmath18 generates a parametric family of copulas @xmath19\\}$ ] if and only if it satisfies the following conditions  :    ( i ) : :    @xmath20 , ( ii ) : :    @xmath21 for all    @xmath22 .    the function @xmath18 plays a role similar to the generating function in archimedian copulas  @xcite .",
    "each copula @xmath23 is entirely described by the univariate function @xmath18 and the parameter @xmath24 , which tunes the dependence between the margins .",
    "for instance , @xmath25 generates the farlie - gumbel - morgenstern ( fgm ) family of copulas  @xcite , which contains all copulas with both horizontal and vertical quadratic sections  @xcite .",
    "another example is @xmath26 which defines the parametric family of symmetric copulas with cubic sections proposed in  @xcite , equation  ( 4.4 ) . of course",
    ", it is also possible to choose @xmath18 so as to define new copulas , see section  [ simul ] for an example .",
    "let @xmath27 be a random pair from the cumulative distribution function @xmath28 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the cumulative distribution functions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the estimation of the copula reduces to estimating the generating function @xmath18 and the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "this estimation clearly suffers from an identifiability problem since , for instance , replacing @xmath18 by @xmath31 and @xmath24 by @xmath32 for any positive @xmath33 leads to the same copula . when @xmath34 , introducing @xmath35 and @xmath36 yields @xmath37 where @xmath38 satisfies the conditions of lemma  [ lemprinc ] and @xmath39 .",

    "this integral can be calculated analytically or numerically by simpson s rule , depending on the complexity of the basis of functions .",
    "it is also possible to estimate @xmath86 in a nonparametric way by rescaling the empirical version of  ( [ deftau ] ) introduced in  @xcite with the factor @xmath87 to obtain : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the indicator function .",

    "if no information is available on the distribution @xmath93 , one can use the nonparametric estimate @xmath140 now , restricting ourselves to the family @xmath113 allows to consider semiparametric estimates , which are much more accurate than the nonparametric one .",

    "the same parameters as in the simulation section are used .",

    "of course , since the true function @xmath183 is not known ( and perhaps does not exist ) , it is only possible to compare the estimations obtained with the nonparametric and semiparametric estimates @xmath144 and @xmath143 .",
    "the semiparametric estimation reveals two main groups of countries . in the first one , both men and women share a small life expectancy with weak differences between sexes . in the second one ,",
