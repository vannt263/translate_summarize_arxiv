    "<S> our main theorem is that the pullback of an associated noncommutative vector bundle induced by an equivariant map of quantum principal bundles is a noncommutative vector bundle associated via the same finite - dimensional representation of the structural quantum group . on the level of @xmath0-groups , we realize the induced map by the pullback of explicit matrix idempotents . we also show how to extend our result to the case when the quantum - group representation is infinite dimensional , and then apply it to the ehresmann - schauenburg quantum groupoid . </S>",
    "<S> finally , using noncommutative milnor s join construction , we define quantum quaternionic projective spaces together with noncommutative tautological quaternionic line bundles and their duals . as a key application of the main theorem , </S>",
    "<S> we show that these bundles are stably non - trivial as noncommutative complex vector bundles .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.75    our result is motivated by the search of @xmath1-invariants . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is to use equivariant homomorphisms to facilitate computations of such invariants by moving them from more complicated to simpler algebras . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy was recently successfully applied in @xcite to distinguish the @xmath1-classes of noncommutative line bundles over two different types of quantum complex projective spaces . </S>",
    "<S> herein we generalize from associated noncommutative line bundles to associated noncommutative _ vector _ bundles </S>",
    "<S> . then we apply our general theorem to noncommutative vector bundles associated with a finitely iterated equivariant noncommutative join @xcite of @xmath2 with itself .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that the @xmath3-times iterated join @xmath4 yields the odd sphere @xmath5 , and the diagonal @xmath6-action on the join defines a fibration producing the @xmath3-th quaternionic projective space : @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we denote the @xmath3-iterated equivariant noncommutative join of @xmath8 with itself by @xmath9 , and consider the fixed - point subalgebra @xmath10 as the defining c*-algebra @xmath11 of a _ quantum quaternionic projective space_. then we define the noncommutative tautological quaternionic line bundle and its dual as noncommutative complex vector bundles associated through the contragredient representation of the fundamental represention of  @xmath2 and the fundamental represention itself , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that , as in the classical case , they are isomorphic as noncommutative ( complex ) vector bundles .    </S>",
    "<S> a classical argument , proving the non - triviality of a vector bundle associated with a principal bundle by restricting the vector bundle to an appropriate subspace , uses the fact that the thus restricted vector bundle is associated with the restricted principal bundle . </S>",
    "<S> the latter restriction is encoded by an equivariant map of total spaces of principal bundles , which induces a natural transformation of chern characters of the vector bundles in question .    </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be compact hausdorff right @xmath14-spaces . </S>",
    "<S> assume that the on @xmath12 is free . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath15 is a continuous @xmath14-equivariant map , the on @xmath13 is automatically free as well , and therefore we have then a @xmath14-equivariant homeomorphism of compact principal bundles over @xmath16 : @xmath17 its inverse , given by means of the _ translation map _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 , @xmath19 , is as follows : @xmath20 here the fiber product over @xmath21 is given by the canonical quotient map @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and by the @xmath24-induced map @xmath25 , @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath14-equivariant continuous maps between total spaces of compact principal @xmath14-bundles are equivalent to continuous maps between their base spaces . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the isomorphism class of a compact principal @xmath14-bundle is uniquely determined by the homotopy class of a map from its base space to a compact approximation of the classifying space @xmath27 . as shown by milnor  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the quotient map @xmath28 is a principal @xmath14-bundle which is a compact approximation of a universal principal @xmath14-bundle @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> to decide whether a given compact principal @xmath14-bundle is nontrivial , it is sufficient to prove that at least one of its associated vector bundles is nontrivial . furthermore , every associated vector bundle is a pullback of a universal vector bundle , both corresponding to the same representation @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the compatibility of associating and pulling back @xmath31 which is afforded by the @xmath14-equivariant homeomorphism ( [ equiv ] ) .    in particular , for @xmath32 ( when @xmath33 ) , the restriction of the tautological quaternionic line bundle @xmath34 from @xmath35 to @xmath36 is the tautological quaternionic line bundle @xmath37 over @xmath36 , so that the chern character computation proving the nontriviality of @xmath37 proves also the nontriviality of @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> the present paper generalizes this reasoning to the noncommutative setting as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , we use the gelfand - naimark theorem to encode compact hausdorff spaces as commutative unital c*-algebras . </S>",
    "<S> next , we employ the peter - weyl theory to describe a compact group as a hopf algebra of representative functions . </S>",
    "<S> then , we take advantage of the peter - weyl theory extended from compact groups to compact principal bundles @xcite to express a compact principal bundle as a comodule algebra over the hopf algebra of representative functions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the serre - swan theorem to encode a vector bundle as a finitely generated projective module . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we describe an associated vector bundle as an associated finitely generated projective module @xcite using the milnor - moore cotensor product  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> having all these basic structures given in terms of commutative algebras , we generalize by dropping the assumption of commutativity .    in precise technical terms , </S>",
    "<S> we proceed as follows . for any finite - dimensional corepresentation @xmath38 of a coalgebra @xmath39 coacting principally on an algebra @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> , we can use the cotensor product @xmath41 to form an associated finitely generated projective module @xmath42 over the coaction - invariant subalgebra  @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the module @xmath42 is the section module of the associated noncommutative vector bundle . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath44 is an algebra with a principal coaction of  @xmath39 , and @xmath45 is its coaction - invariant subalgebra , then any equivariant ( colinear ) algebra homomorphism @xmath46 restricts and corestricts to an algebra homomorphism @xmath47 making @xmath48 a @xmath49-bimodule . </S>",
    "<S> the theorem of the paper is :    * theorem 0.1 . * </S>",
    "<S> _ the finitely generated left @xmath48-modules @xmath50 and @xmath51 are _ isomorphic_. in particular , for any equivariant * -homomorphism @xmath52 between unital c*-algebras equipped with a free action of a compact quantum group , the induced k - theory map @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the respective fixed - point subalgebras , satisfies @xmath56)=[a'\\box^{\\mathcal{c}}v]$ ] . _    we begin by stating our main result in the standard and easily accessible hopf - algebraic setting ( theorem  [ hopf ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we state and prove two slightly different coalgebraic generalizations of the result : theorem  [ faith ] based on faithful flatness and coflatness ( cosemisimple coalgebras but with corepresentations of any dimension ) , and theorem  [ main ] based on chern - galois theory  @xcite ( arbitrary coalgebras but with corepresentations of finite dimensions ) .    </S>",
    "<S> an advantage of the faithful - flatness - and - coflatness approach is a possibility to apply it in the case of infinite - dimensional vector fibers . in particular , we prove ( theorem  [ twofaith ] ) that the pullback of the ehresmann - schauenburg quantum groupoid of a quantum principal bundle is the ehresmann - schauenburg quantum groupoid of the pullback of the quantum principal bundle .    </S>",
    "<S> an advantage of the chern - galois approach is a possibility to compute explicitly a @xmath57-theoretic invariant whose non - vanishing for a given principal extension proves that the extension is not cleft  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aforementioned coalgebraic generality is necessary already in the case of celebrated non - standard podle spheres , which are fundamental examples of noncommutative geometry going beyond the reach of hopf - galois theory  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the peter - weyl functor to make the result applicable to free actions of compact quantum groups on unital c*-algebras  @xcite . in the c*-algebraic </S>",
    "<S> setting we consider our example and main application : the stable non - triviality of the noncommutative tautological quaternionic line bundles and their duals . </S>"
