    "in just the last year , center - of - mass energies reached in heavy ion collisions have increased by more than an order of magnitude over those previously attained at the ags .",
    "nevertheless , several outstanding issues remain in the ags energy regime .",
    "the characterization of the evolution of the initial - state nucleons can be studied through the spectra and rapidity distribution of protons .",
    "the mechanisms underlying the production of strange and anti - strange quarks may be investigated through the examination of the yields and spectral shapes of @xmath0 mesons , antilambdas , and antiprotons .",
    "e917 is the last in the e802/e859/e866 series of heavy ion experiments that were performed at the ags .",
    "the e917 apparatus consisted of a series of beam counters , a beam vertexing detector , a multiplicity array surrounding the target , a hodoscope , a zero - degree calorimeter , and a movable spectrometer composed of drift chambers , magnet , and time - of - flight wall .",
    "the calorimeter and multiplicity array were used to determine collision centrality , while the spectrometer was used for tracking and particle identification .",
    "detailed descriptions of the equipment can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the invariant yields of protons were determined from 6 , 8 , and 10.8 gev / nucleon au+au collisions as a function of transverse mass ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the data were fit with a boltzmann function over ten rapidity intervals .",
    "rapidity distributions ( @xmath11 ) were extracted for five centrality classes at each beam energy and are presented in figure  [ proton_dndy ] .",
    "two qualitative features emerge from the data .",
    "first , a smooth evolution in shape from concave for the most peripheral event class ( @xmath12 ) to convex for the most central ( @xmath13 ) is evident at all beam energies .",
    "second , the @xmath11 curves are not well - described by a singly - peaked function , but rather are consistent with a bimodal distribution , even for the most central events .",
    "the nature of this double - peak has been quantified by fitting the curves with a gaussian distribution reflected about mid - rapidity  @xcite . the persistence of bimodal shape for even the most central events suggests that complete stopping is not achieved at ags energies , and that the longitudinal rapidity distribution is a result of transparency .",
    "a measurement of the ratio of antilambdas ( @xmath14 ) to directly produced antiprotons ( @xmath15 ) allows us to indirectly compare the ratio of @xmath16 quarks to light anti - quarks ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "theoretical predictions for this quantity range from @xmath19 from thermal models  @xcite to @xmath20 in the rqmd cascade model  @xcite .",
    "invariant mass spectra for accepted @xmath21 pairs were constructed for bins in @xmath22 and @xmath23 for both central ( @xmath24 ) and peripheral ( @xmath25 ) collisions at a beam energy of @xmath26 gev / nucleon for events which contained at least one @xmath27 in the spectrometer .",
    "an event - mixed background was normalized to the mass region outside the @xmath14 peak , defined as lying more than 6 standard deviations away from the nominal @xmath14 mass .",
    "the yield was determined by subtracting the number of @xmath21 pairs which lie within 3 standard deviations of the peak from those in the background . since a significant number of the observed antiprotons",
    "are produced by @xmath14 decay , both @xmath22 spectra were simultaneously fit with boltzmann functions , as described in  @xcite .",
    "this fit procedure yields values for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the inverse slopes for each .",
    "we find that the @xmath14/@xmath27 ratio increases from @xmath30 in peripheral events to @xmath31 in central events .",
    "this is consistent with an earlier indirect estimate which combined different results for the @xmath27 yield from the e864 and e878 experiments , under the assumption that the difference was due to different acceptances for @xmath27 from @xmath14 feed - down  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is the lightest bound state of two strange quarks ( @xmath32 ) ; it is therefore a useful probe of the strangeness produced in the reaction .",
    "it s properties may also be sensitive to in - medium modifications of meson properties .     to @xmath33 yield as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "the circles are e917 data ; the square is p+p from ref . @xcite . ]     to @xmath33 yield as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "the circles are e917 data ; the square is p+p from ref . @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath0 mesons were reconstructed from @xmath35 pairs in the data in a similar fashion to that of the @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath22 spectra were fit with exponential functions , and the yields were extracted over the rapidity range @xmath36 for five different centrality classes .",
    "the absolute yields as a function of centrality have been previously reported  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ phinpp ] shows the @xmath0 yield divided by @xmath34 , the number of projectile participants , as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath37 ratio increases by a factor of @xmath38 from peripheral to central collisions , which demonstrates that @xmath0 mesons are produced through collective phenomena , and not just a simple superposition of individual nucleon - nucleon reactions . displayed in figure  [ phikplus ] is the @xmath39 ratio as a function of @xmath34 , where it is evident that the ratio is independent of centrality .",
    "e917 has studied the systematics of baryon stopping , and the production of @xmath0 mesons , antilambdas , and antiprotons in au+au collisions at 6 , 8 , and 10.8 gev / nucleon .",
    "these studies indicate that the colliding nuclei are not fully stopped , and that secondary interactions play a significant role in @xmath0 production .",
    "the large increase in the @xmath14/@xmath27 ratio from peripheral to central collisions remains unexplained by theory .",
