    "the prompt grb photon spectrum , @xmath0 , is usually given by a band function  @xcite which can be approximated by a broken power law , @xmath1 the spectrum is presumably produced by synchrotron radiation of electrons in the internal shock fronts of the jet , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there are two approaches to explain the break in the spectrum at a break energy of typically @xmath2  kev : the most common explanation is the steepening of the spectrum by a power of one due to cooling of electrons at high energies , see for example  @xcite as a review .",
    "the break can , however , also be explained by assuming an inverse compton scattering scenario , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein . throughout the paper ,",
    "all given energies are in the observer s frame at earth unless declared otherwise .",
    "the spectral indices are usually scattered around average values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "assuming hadronic acceleration in the jet , a prompt neutrino flux that is correlated to the photon spectrum results from photohadronic interactions in the source .",
    "the neutrino spectrum , @xmath5 , can be derived assuming that the proton spectrum follows the electron spectrum of the source .",
    "since the neutrino flux in turn follows the proton spectrum in first order approximation , it can thus be connected to the observed synchrotron spectrum of the sources and can be described as @xmath6 the photon spectral indices can be used to describe @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the second break at @xmath9 in the neutrino spectrum results from the fact that pions lose energy at very high energy due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "thus , less neutrinos result from pions at very high energies which leads to a steepening of the spectrum by a power of 2 .",
    "a detailed derivation of the neutrino spectrum as presented above is given in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is normalized to the @xmath10-ray fluence @xmath11 which is assumed to be proportional to the neutrino luminosity , @xmath12 all parameters occurring in following calculations are listed in table [ parameters ] .",
    "the factor @xmath13 is given by the product of the fraction of proton energy transfered to the pions , @xmath14 , a factor @xmath15 since half of the photohadronic interactions result in four neutrinos and a factor @xmath16 to account for the fraction of total energy in electrons compared to protons in the jet  @xcite .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath17 is therefore given as @xmath18 in the following , the normalization of a single burst will be modified to a quasi - diffuse normalization by multiplying @xmath17 with the number of bursts per year ( @xmath19 long duration bursts per year ) and dividing the result by @xmath20 sr , @xmath21    the first break energy in the spectrum , @xmath22 , is related to the break energy in the photon spectrum as @xmath23 it is determined through the minimal energy necessary to produce a @xmath24-resonance in the shock fronts of the bursts . using the numerical values given in  @xcite for the proton mass , @xmath25  gev , and the @xmath24 mass , @xmath26  gev , leads to @xmath27    the second break energy is connected to the synchrotron loss time .",
    "it depends on the neutrino flavor and for muon neutrinos , it is given as @xmath28    for electron and anti - muon neutrinos the break energy @xmath29 is about an order of magnitude lower , since these neutrinos result from the muon decay .",
    "the muon lifetime is about a factor of 100 higher than the pion lifetime , which reduces the threshold of synchrotron losses .",
    "the derivation of the second break energy can be found in  @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the fraction of the burst s internal energy going into the magnetic field respectively into electrons .",
    "the equipartition fractions have been set to @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "there is no good way of determining the equipartition fractions theoretically yet .",
    "however , afterglow observations indicate values of the order of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the remaining parameters in equ .",
    "( [ ens_1 ] ) are listed in table  [ parameters ] with the values as used in the following calculations .",
    "inserting all numerical values gives @xmath35    the boost factor @xmath36 is constrained to @xmath37 , since for boost factors less than @xmath38 , the medium would be optically thick to photons and for @xmath39 , since protons lose most of their energy to synchrotron radiation .",
    "the possibility of fluctuating @xmath36 using the photon break energy is given as demonstrated in @xcite , but there are several arguments for using a constant value : bursts can be misaligned which would lead to a misinterpretation of the boost factor .",
    "also , varying the break energy for each single burst might implicitly already include boost factor fluctuations .",
    "thus , a constant boost factor of @xmath40 is used in following calculations .",
    "in previous papers , e.g.  @xcite , a variation of the fraction of energy going into pions @xmath14 has been discussed .",
    "such a variation would further increase the width of the distribution of the neutrino spectrum normalization .",
    "@xmath14 varies with the burst luminosity , the boost factor , the photon break energy and the variability time as @xmath41 in the following , this fraction will be kept at a constant value of @xmath42 for the following reasons :    * @xmath14 strongly depends on the boost factor @xmath36 which will be used as a constant as discussed before .",
    "the dependence on the other three parameters is only linearly and thus not as striking as a variation of @xmath36 would be .",
    "* the main uncertainties in the current calculations result from the lack of knowledge of the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath30 as well as from uncertainties in the redshift relation which leads to uncertainties in @xmath43 .",
    "these three parameters are all important in the determination of the spectrum normalization and thus , a constant value is favorable .",
    "the variability time appears in equ .",
    "( [ ens_equ ] ) as well .",
    "apart from the arguments mentioned for the normalization of the spectrum already , the effect of varying @xmath44 here would not be very significant in the detection rates , because the dominant contribution seen in the detector comes from the energy region of the first break .",
    "the diffuse neutrino flux prediction derived from the model above is given in @xcite , where the authors use average parameters to determine the shape of the spectrum .",
    "cosmological evolution of the sources have been considered in that model by taking into account the redshift evolution of grbs .",
    "it is assumed that grbs follow star formation rate , since they appear to be connected to supernova - ic explosions .",
    "the final result of this work will be compared to this standard flux .",
    "to do this , the diffuse waxman - bahcall flux has to be weighted by a factor @xmath45 , since this work only deals with long duration bursts which make up approximately @xmath45 of the total burst population .",
    "a different approach to predicting the neutrino flux from grbs is to look at each burst individually and add up the individual spectra to make a prediction of the total flux from these sources .",
    "an approach of using individual spectra as discussed by guetta et al .",
    "@xcite will be used here to get an estimate of the flux that can be expected to be observed by coincident measurements of the amanda telescope .",
    "in addition , a diffuse prediction will be made , using the mean values of the parameter distributions that are given or can be derived from batse data .",
    "two different burst samples based on the determination of burst redshifts using the redshift estimators variability ( 568 bursts ) and lag ( 292 bursts ) will be examined in this paper .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the sample properties will be discussed in section  [ samples ] .",
    "due to the necessity of detailed optical afterglow observations for the determination of grb redshifts , there are only about 61 bursts ( by oct 2005 ) with observed redshifts today .",
    "a histogram of the 61 observed redshifts is presented in fig .",

    "all 61 redshifts observed until today are shown as the solid line , the dashed line represents the sample of grbs with redshift until june 2000 , the batse era . because of the low statistics of bursts with directly observed redshifts , different redshift estimators have been developed .",
    "note that these methods apply only to _ long duration bursts_. although first measurements of a short duration burst redshifts succeeded recently , see e.g.  @xcite , there is not enough statistics for short bursts yet .",
    "two burst samples will be used in the following using different estimator methods for the redshift determination .",
    "both burst sets are subsamples of the batse catalog :    a subsample of 568 bursts with redshifts determined using the variability of grbs to estimate redshifts is given by guetta et al .  @xcite . throughout the paper",
    ", it will be referred to the _ variability sample _ when this set of bursts is discussed .",

    "a work particularly dedicated to these about 100 of these bursts will be presented soon in the context of the analysis of a potential neutrino signal from these bursts  @xcite .",
    "not all of the 105 bursts can actually be used for an analysis due to the restricted availability of data on either amanda s or batse s side .",

    "this one event comes from the sources below average in the variability sample - the remaining 12.7 events result from the upper part of the spectrum .",
    "this shows that most of the contribution actually comes from bursts above average .",

    "the lag sample in contrast would only yield 3.6 events compared to 4.7 events in the wb - scenario . mean and total values for the different scenarios are given in table  [ average_rate_params ] .",
    "it is known since the detailed analysis of batse energy spectra that the parameters of the band fits are not universal , but can differ significantly with the individual bursts .",
    "this implies that also the neutrino spectra of single sources have very different appearances",
    ".    the challenging task in the future will be to get a more accurate description of the redshift estimators , since until today , the relations are still derived from a very small sample of bursts with measured redshifts .",
    "the first redshift measurements of swift give hope to a significant enlargement of the sample of measured redshifts in the near future which makes an improvement of the redshift estimators possible .",
    "since it is known that grbs follow star formation rate ( sfr ) , a strong redshift evolution is expected .",
    "therefore , the redshifts are an essential parameter in neutrino flux calculations and the currently available redshift estimators are the most accurate way of dealing with redshifts so far . other parameters like the spectral indices can be derived directly from the burst fits and therefore only include the errors due to uncertainties in the measurement of the photon spectrum .    in this paper , a prediction of the neutrino flux from individual grbs could be made using the model of prompt neutrino emission that has been developed by @xcite .",
    "we follow the ansatz of @xcite by using individual parameters for each burst instead of using average parameters as it has been done by @xcite .",
    "it could be shown that it is quite important to look at grb neutrino spectra individually to get an accurate description of a signal from these sources .",
    "this is of special interest for large volume neutrino telescopes as amanda , since an accurate description of the potential signal is necessary in order to optimize an analysis .",
