    "<S> we study non - fermi liquid states that arise at the quantum critical points associated with the spin density wave ( sdw ) and charge density wave ( cdw ) transitions in metals with twofold rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we use the dimensional regularization scheme , where a one - dimensional fermi surface is embedded in @xmath0 dimensional momentum space . in three dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> quasilocal marginal fermi liquids arise both at the sdw and cdw critical points : the speed of the collective mode along the ordering wavevector is logarithmically renormalized to zero compared to that of fermi velocity . below three dimensions , however , the sdw and cdw critical points exhibit drastically different behaviors . at the sdw critical point , a stable anisotropic non - fermi liquid state is realized for small @xmath1 , where not only time but also different spatial coordinates develop distinct anomalous dimensions </S>",
    "<S> . the non - fermi liquid exhibits an emergent algebraic nesting as the patches of fermi surface are deformed into a universal power - law shape near the hot spots . due to the anisotropic scaling , </S>",
    "<S> the energy of incoherent spin fluctuations disperse with different power laws in different momentum directions . at the cdw critical point , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the perturbative expansion breaks down immediately below three dimensions as the interaction renormalizes the speed of charge fluctuations to zero within a finite renormalization group scale through a two - loop effect . </S>",
    "<S> the difference originates from the fact that the vertex correction anti - screens the coupling at the sdw critical point whereas it screens at the cdw critical point . </S>",
