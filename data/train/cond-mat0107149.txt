    "recent advances in fabrication of ferromagnetic  semiconductor heterostructures@xcite and the observation of spin injection into semiconductors@xcite have lead to new interest in transport properties of spin polarized systems .",
    "there has been considerable work done in the field of metallic magnetic multilayers , which has been analyzed in terms of transport equations with spin dependent distribution functions@xcite .",
    "these works based their analysis on diffusion transport equations .",
    "the justification of using these equations was given by valet and fert@xcite , who derived a spin diffusion equation from the boltzmann equation in the limit where the spin scattering length is much longer than the momentum relaxation length .",
    "recently , the transport equation were utilized to analyze the feasibility of spin injection into semiconductors with the result that the crucial parameter is the conductivity mismatch between the semiconductor and the ferromagnet@xcite and to study theoretically spin - polarized transport in in inhomogeneous doped semiconductors@xcite .",
    "none of these approaches take the electron - electron ( e - e ) scattering into account .",
    "clearly the e - e interactions play a different role than in usual spin degenerate transport , where the e - e interaction does not provide a mechanism for momentum relaxation and hence has only indirect consequences for transport coefficients . in spin polarized transport",
    "the two spin species have different drift velocities and e - e interactions are instrumental in equilibrating this difference .",
    "this leads to a spin drag effect where the spins carrying the larger current will drag along the spins carrying the smaller current .",
    "this drag effect has been considered recently by damico and vignale@xcite in three dimensions using linear response theory .",
    "they found that the the spin drag resistivity was appreciable and can at elevated temperatures become fractions of the usual resistivity of the metal . in two dimensions the effect of e - e interactions on spin diffusion has been considered theoretically by takahashi et al.@xcite .",
    "using a quantum kinetic equation approach , previously utilized in @xmath1he-@xmath2he solutions@xcite , they studied the spin diffusion coefficients in two dimensional electron gases . in order to study this spin diffusion they used variational functions but did not include spin relaxation scattering .    in this paper",
    ", we use the boltzmann equation to study spin dependent transport and spin diffusion .",
    "we restrict our selves to the study of colinear magnetization and our goal is to derive a set of transport equation in the semiclassical limit . for this purpose",
    "the boltzmann equation is adequate . for the non - colinear case , where phenomena like damped transverse spin modes can not occur",
    ", one must go beyond the present approach , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "we include impurity scattering , both spin independent and spin flip scattering , as well as e - e scattering .",
    "we show that a shifted fermi ",
    "dirac distribution ( sfd ) , is a valid solution at low temperatures , @xmath3 and without spin flip scattering .",
    "this is also the case for weak e - e scattering , where the problem in absence of spin flip reduces to the ordinary coulomb drag situation@xcite .",
    "we then go on to discuss the general case at higher temperatures , general interaction strength and finite intrinsic spin flip scattering . using a sfd ansatz",
    ", we find for an isotropic system the following macroscopic transport equations    [ macrotrans ] @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the current carried by electrons with spin @xmath0 , @xmath6 is the local spin dependent electro chemical potential , @xmath7 is the conductivity of the spin @xmath0 electron gas , @xmath8 is a spin lifetime due to intrinsic spin flip processes , @xmath9 is a spin current conversion conductivity arising from the angle dependence of spin flip scattering , and @xmath10 is the relative spin density , see eqs .",

    "the first transport equation ( [ cont.eq ] ) is the continuity equation , which expresses the conservation of current in the presence of spin flip processes .",
    "the second equation  ( [ ohmslaw ] ) is a generalized ohm s law .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is the usual ohm s low , while the second term describes that a momentum imbalance between the two spin directions gives rise to an additional resistance if there is a mechanism for conversion of spin current .",
    "there are two such processes possible .",
    "this first one is the spin drag effect mentioned above , where e - e scattering makes transfer of momentum possible .",
    "the second one is due elastic spin flip scattering on for example magnetic impurities , which can convert a current with one spin polarization to a current of the opposite polarization , if the spin flip matrix element has an angular dependence .",
    "for example if the spin flip predominately scatters forward it means that a spin flip scattering is accompanied with a transfer of momentum .",
    "in contrast if the spin flip scattering is purely @xmath0-wave scattering the momentum transfer between the spin channels is on average equal to zero . this can be seen mathematically from the expression for @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ tausf ] ) .",
    "the derivation of the these two terms is the main result of the present paper .",
    "two consequences of the spin current relaxation terms can immediately be read off .",
    "firstly , they give rise to an increased resistivity in the case where the current is spin polarized .",
    "for example , taking @xmath18 the effective resistivity for electrons with spin @xmath19 becomes @xmath20 and hence an enhanced resistivity .",
    "secondly , from eqs .",
    "( [ macrotrans ] ) we get a diffusion equation for the electro chemical potential difference @xmath21 where@xmath22 \\sum_{s}\\left [ \\frac{1}{\\sigma _ { s}}+\\left ( \\frac{1}{\\sigma _ { { \\rm sf , s}}}+\\frac{1}{\\sigma _ { d}\\alpha _ { s}}\\right ) \\left ( 1+\\alpha _ { s}\\right ) \\right ] .\\qquad\\ ] ] this shows that the intrinsic spin relaxation length is decreased by the spin drag and angle dependent spin flip effects .",
    "similarly , we get that the following weighted sum of electro chemical potentials must vanish , @xmath23 where @xmath24    below we derive eqs .",
    "( [ cont.eq]),([ohmslaw ] ) and estimate the spin drag contributions .",
    "for the two - dimensional case , we have also performed the integration of eq .",
    "( [ rhod ] ) numerically .",
    "we base our analysis on the boltzmann equation for transport through a system with lifted spin degeneracy .",
    "we take the current to run in the @xmath25-direction and denote the non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath26 and the equilibrium fermi  dirac distribution function @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the chemical potential and @xmath30 as usual the inverse temperature .",

    "this set of integral equations can not be solved in general and one must either solve them numerically ( for example as in ref .",

    "one simplification is however possible from symmetry . because of the cylindrical symmetry the functions @xmath46",

    "in this section we study the boltzmann equation in the presence of e - e interaction , but in the absence of spin flip processes , i.e. @xmath52 furthermore , because a low temperature expansion allows for a solution of the boltzmann equation , we start by examining this limit and later we discuss the validity of this solution even at elevated temperatures .",
    "it turns out that the solution in the low temperature regime corresponds to a sfd distribution .    in the low temperature limit",

    "the same conclusion applies to the situation of arbitrary temperatures but weak e - e scattering , because this limit corresponds to the usual coulomb drag regime .",
    "this is however no longer necessarily true at arbitrary e - e scattering , when the temperature increases , or when spin flip processes are included .",
    "nevertheless , we shall assume in the following that the sfd distribution is a good approximation for the exact distribution function . the argument for doing this is as follows : the e - e interactions will drag the distribution functions towards shifted fermi ",
