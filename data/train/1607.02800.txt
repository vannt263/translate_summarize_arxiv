    "since the plants in the real world are always disturbed by all kinds of non - negligible noises , stability analysis for stochastic systems has now attracted more and more researchers attentions .",
    "this task has never been easy and becomes much more difficult when the systems are equipped with non - vanishing noise at the equilibrium . in this case",
    ", almost all classic stability analysis methods fails to be applied to these system , and , even worse , the systems barely admit lyapunov stability behavior in the stochastic form .    notwithstanding these difficulties , researchers have done a lot of work intended to deal with stochastic systems with persistent noise in the past few decades .",
    "following the idea of stochastic passivity @xcite , some efforts are done to weaken the global dissipation conditions in this theory so that it can be applied to the considered systems and some stability behavior is ensured . among them",
    "there re two major modifications .",
    "one is to consider the dissipation of lyapunov function only outside a neighborhood of the equilibrium ( @xcite or @xcite ) and another is to discuss noise - to - state stability @xcite .",
    "in fact , according to _ proposition 2.5 _ in @xcite , noise - to - state stability can be implied by the former one , thus these two modifications mentioned above are actually quite connected .",
    "both of these techniques have been successfully applied to all kinds of practical systems , such as port - hamiltonian systems @xcite and large scale systems @xcite .",
    "noise - to - state stability can be seen as a stochastic counterpart of input - to - state stability introduced in @xcite . for it ,",
    "the expectation of increment of lyapunov function consists of two terms , a dissipative one and an additional one decided by the covariance of noise . with this structure",
    ", it s shown that the state and @xmath0-th moment of noise - to - state stability system are bounded in probability , which demonstrate a particular sense of stability for the stochastic systems @xcite .",
    "this result provides a possible solution for the problem , however we are not fully satisfied with it , because the worry about extreme events ca nt be eliminated by this discussion . as a matter of fact ,",
    "boundedness in probability depicts the distribution of a great many trajectories with the same initial condition , but what we care more is the almost sure long time behavior of a single trial that is robust with the given parameters .",
    "therefore , instead of considering probability distribution , here comes a straightforward idea , discussing the distribution of state points _ in a single trajectory _ to be almost surely controlled .",
    "mathematically , it s to show that the inferior time average of each indicator function @xmath1 is almost surely bounded from below and goes to 1 as the bound , @xmath2 , going to infinity . in physical sense",
    ", it illustrates that the trajectory will fluctuate in a region around the origin with a large proportion of time , and , once going out of this region , the state will soon be back to it . in this paper",
    ", we will show such property holding true for exponential noise - to - state stability system by presenting time average analysis of the indicator function .",
    "as matter of fact , this analysis is quite easy to be achieved when the noise of the system is non - singular . in this case , the stochastic process admits feller and irreducible properties . therefore , together with the recurrence of noise - to - state stability systems , these facts implies ergodicity @xcite , which demonstrates the time average of the indicator function equals to the spacial ( probabilistic ) average .",
    "unfortunately , such non - singular condition is at loss for many stochastic systems , and therefore we have to apply another method to deal with our problem .",
    "borrowing the technique in @xcite , we construct loops for the process in _ definition [ def loops ] _ and , latter , time average analysis is done through detecting the average of time spent in each part of the loop .",
    "although non - singularity no longer presented , its position is taken over by the exponential dissipation condition which makes our analysis possible in this work .",
    "particularly , it should be noted that there s no any additional condition required in our main result , _ theorem [ thm main result ] _ , showing the lower boundedness of inferior time average of indicator functions for exponential noise - to - state stability systems .",
    "this paper demonstrates another sense of stability for noise - to - state stability systems distinct from boundedness in probability , and therefore can be seen as a supplement to noise - to - state stability theory .    in the sequel this paper",
    "is organized as follow . in _ section 2 _ , we briefly review the basic concept and results of noise - to - state stability and , in _ section 3 _ , some strong laws of large numbers are prepared for later time average analysis .",
    "the main results are presented in _",
    "section 4 _ which demonstrate the positive lower boundedness of inferior time average of each indicator function . in _ section 5 _ ,",
    "a numerical example is introduced to show the efficiency of our work . finally , _",

    "are some notations that the readers will find in the context .    [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "[ section nss ] in this section , we briefly review the concept of noise - to - state stability and figure out some of its essential results , including the most important one that there exists a probability bound on the system s state @xcite .    usually , a practical system can be modeled by a stochastic differential equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the state of the system and @xmath5 is a standard winier process . for it",
    ", @xmath6 is a positive definite bounded borel measurable covariance matrix , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are locally lipschitz so that there s a local solution for the equation .",
    "the concept of noise - to - state stability is proposed to analyse the systems with non - vanishing noise and unknown covariance , that is @xmath9 and @xmath10 being unknown .",
    "its specific definition is as    [ def nns ] for stochastic system ( [ eq .",

    "stochastic systems ] ) is said to be exponential noise - to - state stability .    for convenience ,",
    "we denote @xmath23 in the context .    following the technique in @xcite , literature",
    "@xcite notes that for a noise - to - state stability system there s another lyapunov function , @xmath24 , together with a quaternary @xmath13 function set @xmath25 rendering the system to be exponential noise - to - state stable .",
    "therefore , these two concepts , noise - to - state stability and exponential noise - to - state stability , are actually equivalent . in the sequel ,",
    "results are all presented in the framework of exponential noise - to - state stability , however they still hold true for the noise - to - state stability systems if the notations @xmath26 are substituted by @xmath27 .",
    "it s clear that for a noise - to - state stability system , @xmath20 is radially unbounded and @xmath28 is upper bounded by @xmath29 ( a constant ) . therefore , according to @xcite , there s a global solution for system ( [ eq .",
    "stochastic systems ] ) which ensure the results in the sequel of this paper not to be castles in the air .    as for exponential noise - to - state stability systems , thanks to its exponential dissipation condition , it s possible for us to construct an essential super - martingale like inequality , shown in the next lemma , which plays a fundamental role in all kinds of analysis . as a matter of fact",
    ", our analysis in section 4 is also heavily based on this inequality .",

    "this is the very reason why we call inequality ( [ eq .",

    "since @xmath47 presented in the definition , we can observe that the right hand side of inequality ( [ ineq boundedness in probability ] ) goes to 1 as @xmath2 going to infinity , which shows that the state of the system is bounded in probability .",
    "_ theorem [ thm boundedness in probability ] _ is a beautiful result , revealing the fact that there s a probability bound on the system s state for exponential noise - to - state stability .",
    "it illustrates that at a given time the state will stay in a safe region near the origin with a large probability ( cf . inequality ( [ ineq boundedness in probability ] ) ) , which can be seen as a certain sense of stability for the stochastic system .    however , we are not satisfied with it , because this result can not eliminate our worry about the unexpected extreme event . what we interest more is the almost surely long time behavior of the trajectory that is robust with given parameters . instead of considering the distribution in the probability sense ,",
    "we come up with an idea , discussing the distribution of state points measured in time horizon to be almost surely bounded by a particular function .",
    "mathematically , this distribution , denoted as @xmath48 , measures the proportion of time in which the state is bounded by @xmath2 , and , therefore , can be calculated by @xmath49 , termed as the time average of the indicator function @xmath50 .",
    "but such limitation sometimes may lose its meaning , so in order to overcome this problem we replace the limitation notation with the inferior limit one ,  @xmath51 \" .",
    "hence , our goal becomes showing the inferior time average of indicator function @xmath50 to be bounded from below and its value converging to 1 as the bound getting to infinity , that is detecting whether there s a lower bound function @xmath52 s.t .",
    "@xmath53 if such @xmath52 exists , then we denote @xmath54 as the k fractile of distribution @xmath52 which means @xmath55 . in the physical sense ,",
    "if above formulas hold true , then it can be deduced that the trajectory will fluctuate in a region near the origin ( e.g. @xmath56 ) with a large proportion of time ( more than @xmath57 ) , and , once going out , the state will soon be back to it , which demonstrate another sense of stability distinct from the one introduced before . in this paper , we will show that this time average analysis can be achieved for exponential noise - to - state stability system .",
    "before going to further analysis for noise - to - state stability systems , it s necessary for us to prepare some strong law of large numbers first .",
    "the most famous strong law of large numbers is stated that the sample average of a sequence of independent identical distributed random variables converges almost surely to the expected value so long as the expected value is finite .",
    "mathematically , it is presented as    [ thm basic slln ] consider a sequence of independent identical distributed random variables @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath59 , then @xmath60    for the proof of it , readers can refer to @xcite , which is the most elementary one according to our knowledge .",
    "in this section , we present some similar results , that the superior ( inferior ) limit of sample average is almost surely less ( greater ) than a particular constant if the distributions are uniformly controlled .",
    "it should be noted that , in these results , we no longer need the i.i.d condition as is presented in _ theorem [ thm basic slln]_.    first of all , we introduce some basic lemmas in the following . in",
    "_ lemma [ lem random variables to uniform random variables ] _ , we provides a method to map arbitrary random variables to the independent uniformly distributed ones .",
