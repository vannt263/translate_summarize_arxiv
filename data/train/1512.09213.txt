    "a standard strategy in the quantum chemistry of strongly correlated systems is to first compute an approximate zeroth - order wavefunction within an active space of frontier molecular orbitals .",
    "@xcite the description of the remaining correlation outside of the active space is then the purview of multi - reference dynamic correlation theories .",
    "@xcite in principle , it is possible to directly extend single - reference dynamic correlation theories to the multi - reference setting .",
    "however , several complications arise .",
    "first , the dimension of the space in which the perturbed first - order wavefunction resides is much larger in the multi - reference case : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dimension of the active hilbert space , and @xmath3 is the number of external orbitals . thus explicitly representing a general first - order wavefunction is costly .",
    "second , the starting zeroth - order wavefunction is no longer an eigenstate of a one - electron hamiltonian , but rather an interacting hamiltonian .",
    "this means that functions of the zeroth - order hamiltonian , such as the resolvent operator in perturbation theory , are not known in explicit computational form .",
    "third , the standard wick s theorem , which reduces expectation values of fermionic operator strings to products of single - particle density matrices , does not apply.@xcite this leads to the need to compute expensive high - order density matrices .",
    "it is common to circumvent these complications by introducing additional approximations which are not used in the single - reference setting .",
    "some of these are internally contracted wavefunctions,@xcite alternative zeroth - order hamiltonians,@xcite and approximations to high - order density matrices.@xcite while enormously useful , these approximations can lead to new problems of their own , such as intruder states associated with the choice of zeroth - order hamiltonian , or metric instabilities associated with internal contraction.@xcite    in this work , we show that using a time - dependent formulation ameliorates the complexity of the multi - reference dynamic correlation framework , without the need to introduce additional approximations . as an example , we derive and implement the time - dependent @xmath0-electron valence second - order perturbation theory ( t - nevpt2 ) . the resulting theory ,",
    "although equivalent to the fully _ uncontracted _ @xmath0-electron valence perturbation theory,@xcite exhibits a lower computational scaling than the common contracted approximations for large active spaces , and avoids the need to diagonalize metric matrices or compute four - particle density matrices . since the problem is time - independent , introducing time - dependence may also be viewed as a numerical trick equivalent to the well - known laplace transformation of perturbation theory.@xcite however , because the resolvent operator is not known explicitly for an interacting hamiltonian , while time - evolution with the same hamiltonian is a relatively simple operation , the advantages of the laplace transform are greater in the multi - reference as compared to single - reference setting .    in section [ sec : theory ] we review time - independent and time - dependent many - body perturbation theory , taking note of the relevant considerations for the multi - reference setting . in section",
    "[ sec : implementation ] we describe the efficient computational implementation of the time - dependent second - order @xmath0-electron valence perturbation theory . in sections [ sec : compdetails ] and [ sec : results ] we describe the computational details and investigate the performance of t - nevpt2for a number of multi - reference problems with significant dynamic correlation : ( i ) the bond dissociation in and ; ( ii ) the ground and excited states in ; and ( iii ) the potential energy curve of the chromium dimer .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions and future outlook for the formulation .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of time - independent perturbation theory for multi - reference problems .",
    "we define the electronic hamiltonian in second - quantized form as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the usual one- and antisymmetrized two - electron integrals : @xmath7 indices @xmath8 run over the entire spin - orbital basis @xmath9 .",
    "to formulate multi - reference dynamic correlation theories , we partition the spin - orbitals into three sets : ( i ) _ core _ ( doubly - occupied ) with indices @xmath10 ; ( ii ) _ active _ with indices @xmath11 ; and ( iii ) _ external _ ( unoccupied ) with indices @xmath12 ( [ fig : mo_diagram ] ) .",
    ".,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    the hamiltonian can be divided into two parts : @xmath13 where @xmath14 includes terms involving the core or external labels and @xmath15 contains only the active - space contributions : @xmath16 where an additional term is included to describe interaction between the core and active electrons .",
    "we now assume that we have determined a starting complete active - space ( cas ) wavefunction @xmath17 . to construct a multi - reference perturbation theory",
    ", we consider the wavefunction @xmath17 to be an eigenfunction of a zeroth - order hamiltonian @xmath18 . while the choice of @xmath18 is flexible , it is clear that it must be an interacting hamiltonian . a convenient choice , which does not lead to intruder - state problems , and the one we will assume in later development , is the dyall hamiltonian@xcite @xmath19 , defined as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the one - particle density matrix of @xmath17 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can work in the diagonal basis of the core and external generalized fock operators , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and henceforth we will assume that we do so .",
    "we can now consider a direct expansion with respect to the perturbation @xmath24 .",
    "for example , writing the ground - state energy of @xmath25 as @xmath26 , we define the @xmath0th - order perturbation to the energy as : @xmath27 starting from our choice of @xmath28 as the reference hamiltonian , the time - independent perturbation series corresponds to the fully uncontracted @xmath0-electron valence perturbation theory ( nevpt).@xcite denoting @xmath29 as the part of @xmath30 that contributes explicitly to the first - order wavefunction @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , the second - order energy can be written as : @xmath34    we can now observe the complications in the uncontracted multi - reference perturbation theory described above , which arise in evaluating the expression .",
    "the first - order wavefunction involves the resolvent @xmath35 , however , unlike in the single - reference setting , the inversion appears to formally require inverting in the many - particle space .",
    "in addition , @xmath31 lives in a space of determinants with @xmath36 or @xmath37 electrons in the core and active orbitals and @xmath38 or @xmath39 electrons in the external orbitals , respectively . except for very small basis sets ,",
    "the resulting number of determinants is even larger than in the @xmath40-electron complete active space used to determine @xmath17 .",
    "based on these concerns , the above uncontracted multi - reference perturbation theory formulation is almost never used . instead , most implementations use an _ internal contraction _ approximation , where @xmath31 is expanded in a set of contracted many - particle basis functions as @xmath41 where @xmath42 are operators which generate excitations .",
    "different choices of @xmath42 may be made , giving rise to , for example , the strongly - contracted ( sc- ) and partially - contracted ( pc- ) variants of @xmath0-electron valence perturbation theory.@xcite although the numerical error due to internal contraction is generally small,@xcite a significant drawback is that the basis states @xmath43 are no longer orthogonal .",
    "this introduces a many - particle metric into the theory , which can either be diagonalized at large cost ( e.g. @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of active orbitals ) or which leads to numerical instabilities .",
    "further , expectation values such as the energy in eq .   involve the excitation operators @xmath42 .",
    "these then require the evaluation of long strings of fermion operators and the computation of high - order density matrices .",
    "our thesis here is that , when considering larger active spaces , it can be more natural and computationally efficient to work with the original uncontracted formulation , which is a direct extension of the single - reference formalism , rather than with the more commonly implemented and approximate , contracted formulations .",
    "the key is to organize the uncontracted algorithm in an appropriate way . such an organization is conveniently provided by the time - dependent formulation of the perturbation theory .",
    "we now consider multi - reference perturbation expansion from a time - dependent perspective .",
    "the general time - dependent perturbation theory@xcite writes the ground - state wavefunction as : @xmath46\\ket{\\psi_0}}{\\langle \\psi_0 | \\mathcal{t } \\exp \\left[-i \\int_{-\\infty}^0 \\mathrm{d}t \\ ( \\hat{h}^{(0 ) } + \\lambda \\hat{v}(t))\\right]\\ket{\\psi_0 } } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the perturbation is switched on adiabatically at @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 , and the operator @xmath49 ensures time - ordering .    since the perturbation @xmath30 does not depend on time ( aside from the exponentially vanishing adiabatic factor )",
    ", the time - dependent perturbation expansion must be identical to the time - independent expansion discussed in sec .",
    "ii a. for example , the @xmath0th - order wavefunction @xmath50 is identical to the @xmath0th - order wavefunction evaluated from the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory .",
    "similarly , the @xmath0th - order energy given by    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denotes linked contributions , is identical to [ eq : e_n ] . restricting our attention to second - order perturbation theory , [ eq : e_tdpt ] can be written more simply as : @xmath54 where only the @xmath55 contributions are included , and we have made the standard deformation of the integral from the real to imaginary @xmath56 axis with the substitution @xmath57 ( wick rotation ) .",
    "eq .   is no other than the well - known laplace transform expression of the second - order energy , and is transparently equivalent to the time - independent result in [ eq : e_tipt2 ] .",
    "however , the presence of the reference hamiltonian in the exponent rather than in a denominator is a major advantage in the multi - reference setting . in particular , since the zeroth - order hamiltonian for a multi - reference problem must take the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath15 commute , then the exponent factorizes as @xmath60 and the time - evolution can be carried out completely separately in the active and core / external spaces .",
    "( note that this does not require using the dyall hamiltonian specifically ) .",
    "because of this decoupling we do not need to consider the large @xmath61 dimension of the first - order interacting space , and this removes the barrier to working with the uncontracted formulation of multi - reference perturbation theory",
    ". further , time - evolution with @xmath15 is an operation of similar complexity to determining @xmath17 itself , and thus does not lead to an increase in the computational scaling of the method .",
    "while it is possible , in principle , to use the structure of @xmath18 without referring to time - evolution , the time - dependent language provides a natural organization for efficient algorithms .",
    "let us now analyze the time - dependent formulation specializing to the choice of @xmath62 .",
    "we first analyze the structure of contributions to @xmath63 in [ eq : e_tdpt2 ] .",
    "it is convenient to divide @xmath55 into 8 different terms : @xmath64 }       + \\hat{v}^{[+1 ] }       + \\hat{v}^{[-1 ] }       + \\hat{v}^{[+2 ] }       + \\hat{v}^{[-2 ] } \\\\",

    ". in [ eq : e_-2_deriv ] , @xmath75 is a two - particle one - time green s function of the dyall hamiltonian in the active space . in general ,",
    "the time - ordered @xmath76-particle @xmath0-time green s function is defined in imaginary time as : @xmath77 the highest rank active - space green s function that appears in [ eq : e_tdpt2 ] arises from the @xmath55 contributions that involve 3 active - space labels , namely @xmath78}$ ] and @xmath79}$ ] .",
    "contractions of these operators yield three - particle one - time green s functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , as shown in the appendix .    the one- , two- , and three - particle , one - time , active - space green s functions are the central objects to compute in time - dependent second - order @xmath0-electron valence perturbation theory ( t - nevpt2 ) .",
    "the reduction of the energy to these compact quantities is an important strength of the time - dependent view .",
    "physically , this simplicity arises because electron correlation effects are implicitly described by the time - dependence of the green s functions .",
    "we stress that although the time - dependent second - order energy is expressed entirely in terms of reduced green s functions , reminiscent of the internal contraction approximation , there is no approximation being made  [ eq : e_tdpt2 ] yields the fully uncontracted theory .",
    "thus , there is no inversion of a metric tensor , which is a bottleneck for large active spaces and basis sets in internally - contracted theories , and the most complicated object to appear is the three - particle green s function , in contrast to the four - particle density matrix in time - independent internally - contracted nevpt2 .",
    "additional costs arise from the need to compute a time - evolution and time - integration in [ eq : e_tdpt2 ] , however , as we will demonstrate in sec .",
    "iii , these tasks are not computationally difficult and can be carried out very efficiently .",
    "we now briefly discuss the implementation of t - nevpt2for complete active - space self - consistent field ( casscf ) reference wavefunctions.@xcite the t - nevpt2algorithm is summarized below and can be easily implemented using any available full configuration interaction ( fci ) or casscf computer program .",

    "compute initial active - space wavefunctions at @xmath82 ( e.g. , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , etc ) .",
    "there are seven types of active - space states to be computed , namely @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ( see appendix for details ) .",

    "for example , for @xmath97 , the corresponding two - particle green s function is @xmath98 .",
    "3 .   compute correlation energy contributions at @xmath99 as the product of one- and two - electron integrals and the active - space green s functions : @xmath100 .",

    "the basic t - nevpt2algorithm outlined above has @xmath110 computational cost , where @xmath2 is the dimension of the active - space hilbert space , @xmath111 is the number of time steps , and @xmath45 is the number of active orbitals . the efficiency of the algorithm is greatly improved if we avoid the explicit computation and storage of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 states by contracting these wavefunctions with the corresponding two - electron integral tensors .",

    "this is significantly less than the cost of computing the four - particle density matrix in internally - contracted time - independent theories such as sc- and pc - nevpt2 ( @xmath118 ) , when using large active spaces .    for further efficiency improvements ,",
    "it is desirable to reduce the number of time steps @xmath111 while maintaining the accuracy of time - propagation and time - integration . in our implementation ,",
    "the time - propagation in [ eq : propagate ] is performed using the embedded runge - kutta ( erk ) ( 4,5 ) algorithm,@xcite which automatically determines the time step @xmath106 to use in a fourth - order runge - kutta propagation based on the error estimate of the fifth - order propagator approximation , as well as the specified convergence threshold @xmath119 .",
    "we begin time - propagation by setting @xmath106 to a small value ( @xmath120 ) . at each iteration ,",
    "the new time step is determined as @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the time step estimated using the erk method .",
    "the resulting algorithm typically requires 10 - 15 time - propagation steps to achieve 0.1 @xmath123accuracy in the correlation energy @xmath63 .",
    "[ fig : algorithm_errors ] demonstrates the errors in @xmath63 for the dissociation of the molecule , relative to the exact uncontracted nevpt2 correlation energy computed , for different values of @xmath119 .",
    "finally , we stress that each step of the t - nevpt2algorithm can be efficiently parallelized .",
    "in particular , computation , memory storage and time - propagation of the active - space states @xmath95 can be performed in an `` embarrassingly '' parallel fashion , with zero communication between processors . in our parallel implementation ,",
    "each processor is assigned to compute a subset of states @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) , where @xmath126 is the total number of processors ( step 1 of the algorithm above ) . at every time step @xmath99 ,",
    "the @xmath127th subset @xmath128 is propagated on the @xmath127th processor ( step 4 ) .",
    "the correlation energy contributions from each subset @xmath128 can be computed by evaluating the green s function matrix elements @xmath129 , where the states @xmath95 at @xmath82 are either recomputed or accessed from memory ( steps 2 and 3 ) .",
    "we do not exploit parallelism for the energy evaluation in our current implementation , since this is a relatively inexpensive step of the algorithm .",
