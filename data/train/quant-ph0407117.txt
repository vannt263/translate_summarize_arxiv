    "given parts of pure , multi - party , quantum states , where parts are reduced states in subsets of the parties , what does one know about the whole ?",
    "one might have expected that the parts leave something out : that most pure states contain higher - order correlations which are independent of the lower order ones .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "in fact , knowing the reduced states in appropriate subsets of the parties specifies the state completely @xcite , the only state , pure or mixed , consistent with these reduced states is the original state itself .",
    "thus all the information in most pure multi - party states resides in these reduced states .    in @xcite upper and lower bounds",
    "were found on the size of the subsets whose reduced states determine the full pure states .",
    "it was shown that reduced states in no more than two - thirds of the parties are sufficient ( generically ) .",
    "the upper bound was independent of the local dimension , but the lower bound in @xcite was dimension dependent , varying from about @xmath2 for qubits ( @xmath3 ) and increasing monotonically to half for large local dimension . a main result of this paper is to improve both bounds to close to half .",
    "specifically we show that , considering the @xmath4-party reduced states of an @xmath0-party pure state ( each party having equidimensional hilbert spaces ) , a small , interesting ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , set of reduced states in @xmath5 parties ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 indicate rounding up and down to the nearest integer ) almost always form a unique description of the state .",
    "we also prove the lower bound that the @xmath8-party reduced states of pure states do not uniquely distinguish them from other pure or mixed states .",
    "a question , closely related to the above , is , given a set of reduced states , under what circumstances are they compatible with _ any states ( not necessarily unique or pure ) of the full system .",
    "one can think of reduced states as jigsaw puzzle pieces and the question is whether there exist one , or more , jigsaw puzzles of which these are some of the pieces . in @xcite examples",
    "were given which show this can be a complicated issue and a number of authors @xcite have made partial progress . in section",
    "[ jig ] , by giving a particular characterization of quantum states , we describe how real algebraic geometry ( rag ) - the geometric study of real roots of polynomials @xcite - provides a unified mathematical description for these quantum jigsaw puzzles",
    ". methods from rag provide systematic algorithms for tasks like finding conditions which sets of reduced states must satisfy in order to be compatible with a quantum state of the full system . while future developments in algorithmic rag may well make it a useful tool for questions of this sort",
    ", these tasks appear to be hard in a technical sense . despite this ,",
    "given the simplicity of the equations involved , a sphere and cubic surface ( [ eta ] ) , there is hope that analytic progress can be made .",
    "_    section [ ia ] provides the proof of the upper bound that reduced states in @xmath9 parties generically uniquely characterize the state , section [ ib ] proves the lower bound .",
    "section [ jig ] reveals how real algebraic geometry provides a framework for understanding questions about parts of quantum states .",
    "we conclude with some open questions .",
    "we consider a pure quantum state of @xmath0 parties , each of which has a @xmath10-dimensional hilbert space . in the first instance we will consider the case that @xmath0 is even .",
    "we will show that almost every such quantum state is completely determined by its reduced states of @xmath11 parties : for almost every pure state of @xmath0 parties , the unique state , pure or mixed , consistent with these reduced states is the original state .",
    "there are @xmath12 reduced states of @xmath13 parties . in fact , we will show that knowledge of only @xmath1 of them is sufficient , generically , to uniquely specify an @xmath0-party pure state consistent with them .",
    "the set of @xmath1 reduced states may be described as follows : select @xmath1 parties ( for convenience and without loss of generality we take these to be parties @xmath14 ) , then form @xmath15-party reduced states by combining these @xmath1 parties with one further party .",
    "since there are @xmath1 choices for this last party we have a set of @xmath1 @xmath15-party reduced states - this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath16 .",
    "we will write the original pure state as : @xmath17 let us consider one of these reduced states obtained by tracing out parties @xmath18 and call it @xmath19 : @xmath20 the most general state of @xmath0 parties , for which this is a reduced state , will typically be mixed . to allow for this possibility , we consider an environment ` @xmath21 ' with which the system might be entangled in such a way that the whole system is in a pure state @xmath22 .",
    "the most general pure state of system plus environment , consistent with @xmath19 , is : @xmath23 where the states @xmath24 are states of parties @xmath25 up to @xmath1 , plus the environment .",
    "the @xmath26 vectors @xmath27 must satisfy @xmath28 to ensure that the state @xmath29 , when reduced to parties @xmath30 , yields @xmath19 .",
    "in fact we will not need to use equations ( [ ortho ] ) to prove our result that the @xmath15-party reduced states uniquely specify a pure quantum state of @xmath0 parties .",
    "it will be convenient to rewrite each state @xmath27 explicitly as an entangled state of system plus environment : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are states of the environment which need not be normalized or orthogonal , but must only be such that ( [ ortho ] ) holds .",
    "the upper index on the vectors @xmath33 denotes the fact that these are the states of the environment arising from purifications of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath29 , the most general pure state of system and environment consistent with @xmath19 , is then : @xmath34 if @xmath35 is the reduced state of parties @xmath36 arising from the original state @xmath37 then @xmath38 , the most general state of system plus environment consistent with @xmath35 , is : @xmath39 @xmath19 and @xmath35 are both @xmath15-party reduced states of the original pure state @xmath37 . @xmath19 and @xmath35 have parties @xmath40 in common : @xmath19 is a state of party @xmath41 and parties @xmath42 and @xmath35 , party @xmath43 and parties @xmath42 .",
    "there are analogous states @xmath44 arising from the reduced states @xmath45 .",
    "for there to exist one or more pure states which have @xmath46 as their reduced states , these states @xmath47 must be equal .",
    "we will show below that this requirement leads to : @xmath48 all environment states are multiples of a fixed state @xmath49 so that @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath29 is a product state of the original pure state with a state of the environment .",
    "hence , the unique state of the system consistent with the reduced states is @xmath37 , the original state .",
    "we now prove this result .",
    "we first deduce conditions on the states of the environment imposed by requiring @xmath51 . from ( [ psi1],[psi2 ] ) and comparing terms : @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",

    "let us treat @xmath69 and @xmath67 $ ] for all @xmath70 as the variables in a set of @xmath59 homogeneous equations indexed by @xmath58 .",
    "there are @xmath71 of these variables ( recall that @xmath72 are fixed ) .",
    "since we know that all of the coefficients of the variables are distinct , and generically there is no relationship between them , we can pick a subset of @xmath71 equations from the @xmath59 and solve to show @xmath73 for all @xmath74 , @xmath75 for all @xmath76 and @xmath77 for all @xmath78 . by repeating the above procedure for different @xmath79 and @xmath80 values we find @xmath81 .",
    "having considered @xmath51 we now study @xmath82 for all @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and find similarly @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 . combining these results we obtain ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "a similar analysis can be repeated for @xmath0 odd . here",
    "a set of @xmath88 reduced states in @xmath89 parties , generically , uniquely determines the quantum state .",
    "we now derive a lower bound : the reduced states of this fraction of the parties are not sufficient ( generically ) to allow one to reconstruct a unique state of the full system .",
    "again one starts with a pure state @xmath37 of @xmath0 parties .",
    "we calculate all @xmath4-party reduced states .",
    "we then ask whether these @xmath90 @xmath4-party reduced states are consistent with a unique starting state ( i.e. @xmath91 ) or whether there are other ( typically mixed ) states of @xmath0-parties consistent with these @xmath90 @xmath4-party reduced states .",
    "we show that reduced states of @xmath92 parties do not contain enough information to reconstruct a unique state .",
    "consider a starting @xmath0-party pure state @xmath37 .",
    "let us calculate from it the reduced state @xmath93 of the first @xmath4 parties ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this will typically have rank @xmath95 , and we may expand it as @xmath96 where @xmath97 are non - normalised eigenvectors of @xmath93 .",
    "the most general state of @xmath0 parties consistent with this reduced state will be mixed and of rank @xmath98 .",
    "it will be convenient to purify this mixed state of @xmath0 parties to a state @xmath99 of @xmath0 parties plus an environment of dimension @xmath98 .",
    "so , @xmath100    the @xmath101 states @xmath102 of the environment must satisfy : @xmath103 for @xmath99 to reduce to @xmath93 , the original reduced state of the first @xmath4-parties . in the following we will group indices , writing @xmath104 , @xmath105 . given a particular purification of a mixed @xmath4-party state one can form others by a unitary transformation on the environment alone .",
    "let us fix this freedom by rotating the states @xmath106 so that they are expressed in the following way with respect to a fixed orthonormal basis , @xmath107 , of the environment : @xmath108    we may use the unitary freedom on the environment to arrange for the @xmath109 to be real ; the remaining coefficients @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) will be complex .",
    "the total number of real parameters in the states @xmath112 is @xmath113 .",
    "consider a different set of @xmath4 parties . again",
    "calculate the reduced states of @xmath37 for these parties and purify it to a pure state @xmath114 of the system plus environment using the environment spanned by @xmath107 .",
    "this will lead to a different set of @xmath98 states of the environment , @xmath115 .",
    "we will shortly be requiring that @xmath116 and therefore the states @xmath115 lie in the span of the fixed basis of @xmath107 .",
    "the number of real parameters describing the @xmath98 vectors @xmath115 is @xmath117 . proceeding in this way for each possible set of @xmath4 parties , we find that the total number of parameters describing the @xmath118 ( for @xmath119 ) is : @xmath120d^{2n}=d^{2n}\\bigg [ 2\\begin{pmatrix }     n \\\\     m \\\\",
    "\\end{pmatrix } -1\\bigg]\\ ] ]      there are two types of constraint on the @xmath121 .",
    "firstly each set of @xmath121 , for fixed @xmath122 , must satisfy equations like ( [ tapas ] ) which ensure that the purifications associated with these @xmath121 reduce to the correct @xmath4-party reduced state .    the number of constraint equations for each @xmath122 is @xmath123 , so that the total number of equations of this type is @xmath124 ( this is an overestimate since many of these equations will be dependent ) .",
    "the second set of constraints are that the purifications arising from each set of @xmath4 parties are equal .",
    "the fact that @xmath125 leads to @xmath117 equations .",
    "thus the total number of equations of this type ( equating @xmath99 to each of the other purifications ) is @xmath126 .",
    "it may be that not all the constraints described are independent .",
    "an upper bound on the number of independent constraints is thus : @xmath127+\\begin{pmatrix }     n \\\\     m \\\\",
    "\\end{pmatrix}d^{2m}.\\ ] ]      from above : @xmath128 thus for @xmath94 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "the number of constraints is insufficient to uniquely specify the parameters and so , for @xmath0 even , the reduced states in @xmath1 parties do not uniquely determine the state ; for @xmath0 odd , reduced states in @xmath88 parties do not uniquely define the state .",
    "the considerations in previous sections lead us to address the following general ( and related ) questions .",
    "first , _ given some partial information about a putative quantum state ( for example a set of reduced states ) how does one check that this partial information is indeed consistent with one ( or more ) pure or mixed states .",
    "for example , for a state of three parties @xmath131 one might be given three particular two - party density matrices @xmath132 .",
    "one would like to be able to determine whether these three states are possible reduced states of any three party quantum state @xmath133 . _    a second , more general , question is to determine conditions under which partial information about a putative quantum state is in fact legitimate . referring to the example in the previous paragraph , rather than aiming to produce an algorithm which determines whether the _",
    "given @xmath132 are reduced states of any @xmath133 , one would like to have a set of conditions satisfied by the two - party reduced states of @xmath133 ( pure or mixed ) .",
    "despite the similarity of these two questions it should be clear that algorithms for solving them may be rather different .",
    "_    these questions are two version of the task of , given a set of parts of quantum states , testing if there exists any state with these parts . in the same spirit",
    ", one might take a jumble of puzzle pieces and check to see if there exists a jigsaw puzzle of which these are the parts .",
    "one could test if a set of pieces make a whole puzzle by either trying to make that puzzle ( testing a given set of parts ) or checking the pieces against a system of rules ( finding general compatibility conditions ) .    in this section",
    "we aim to show that both questions fall within the area of real algebraic geometry .",
    "the physical questions associated with compatibility of partial information about quantum states may be encoded in two polynomials in real variables ; one polynomial is quadratic ( defining a sphere ) and the other cubic .",
    "computational real algebraic geometry is an active field of current research with considerable effort being devoted to finding algorithms for precisely the problems important here .",
    "we believe that it is intrinsically interesting to identify the part of mathematics within which questions of compatibility of partial information about quantum states lie . one would also like to have methods for solving instances of the problems .",
    "in fact our problems , perhaps not surprisingly , are hard in a strict algorithmic sense .",
    "unfortunately the best algorithms that we are aware of are not sufficiently powerful at present to be useful for interesting cases on modest computers .",
    "nonetheless we anticipate that , with increased algorithmic and computational power , this will change . in any case , we argue that techniques , analytic or algorithmic , from real algebraic geometry are required to solve problems concerning parts of quantum states .",
    "we start by showing that necessary and sufficient conditions for an hermitian matrix , @xmath134 , to be the density matrix of a pure state ( i.e. to be a positive , hermitian matrix with trace one and exactly one non - zero eigenvalue ) are that , @xmath135 ( note that @xmath136 are not sufficient conditions since they are satisfied by the non - positive matrix @xmath137 ) .",
    "it is obvious that the density matrix of a pure state satisfies ( [ eta ] ) . to see that ( [ eta ] ) are sufficient for @xmath134 to be a density matrix , consider a basis for @xmath134 in which it is diagonal with diagonal elements @xmath138 .",
    "then @xmath139 implies that each @xmath140 satisfies @xmath141 .",
    "then : @xmath142 with equality only when each @xmath143 or @xmath144 .",
    "but our conditions ( [ eta ] ) require equality in ( [ lambda_cubed_less_than_lambda_squared ] ) and hence to be compatible with @xmath139 , exactly one @xmath140 must be equal to @xmath144 .    in the first instance , we will illustrate the general issues concerning partial data for quantum states by considering the case of states of three qubits . in this setting",
    "it is helpful to write the state in terms of the bloch decomposition .",
    "any hermitian , trace one , @xmath145 matrix may be written as : @xmath146 where the @xmath147 s are the pauli matrices ( which are hermitian and traceless ) and ` @xmath41 ' is the @xmath148 identity matrix . @xmath149",
    "form a basis for all @xmath148 matrices .",
    "note that @xmath150 etc .",
    "using this parametrization of @xmath133 , ( [ eta ] ) becomes @xmath151=1.\\label{s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that equation ( [ r ] ) defines a sphere .",
    "if @xmath152 satisfies these conditions it is a pure quantum state .      at the beginning of the last section we described two types of questions concerning parts of quantum states .",
    "the first was : given a particular set of partial information about a putative state , can one determine whether this information is legitimate .",
    "in the case of three qubits we might be given , for example , three two - party density matrices @xmath132 .",
    "there are some simple compatibility relations which are easily checked , namely we must have that the one - party states derived from these two - party states are consistent i.e. @xmath153 if these conditions are satisfied , specifying @xmath132 is equivalent to specifying @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 for all @xmath160 . substituting these values into ( [ r],[s ] )",
    "leads to two polynomials in the @xmath161 variables @xmath162 ( in fact they are both quadratics in this case ) . @xmath163 and @xmath164 are legitimate reduced states of some three qubit pure state when there is a set of @xmath162 fulfilling both conditions : i.e. testing compatibility of particular parts of quantum states is equivalent to finding real roots of polynomials .",
    "thus far we have considered the set @xmath132 and asked whether they are parts of a three qubit pure state , but it should be noted that the structure of the problem is essentially the same ( albeit involving more variables ) for much more general situations .",
    "more general partial data could be supplied .",
    "for example , one might be given only @xmath165 and @xmath166 or perhaps only @xmath157 and @xmath154 .",
    "we might also have asked whether @xmath132 are consistent with any mixed state of @xmath167 ( not just a three qubit pure state ) .",
    "one can always purify a mixed state of three qubits by introducing three further qubits @xmath168 .",
    "( the most general state of six qubits may be expressed in a form analogous to ( [ star ] ) but now with terms up to one of the form @xmath169 ) .",
    "thus the question of the existence of a mixed state compatible with @xmath132 is again that of asking if there is a real solution to a pair of polynomial equations ( i.e. the equations expressing the purity of @xmath170 ) given some of the variables .",
    "it should be clear that very general questions concerning compatibility of some particular partial information about a multi - qubit state can be phrased as whether there are solutions to a pair of polynomial equations , one quadratic and one at most cubic in the variables .",
    "finally in this context we note that for any dimension of local hilbert space there are bases consisting of the identity , together with traceless hermitian matrices , thus our description is not restricted to qubits .    while it is useful to understand the general framework within which questions of compatibility of reduced states lie , unfortunately , equations ( [ r],[s ] ) are hard to solve in practice .",
    "finding the real roots of systems of equations in large number of variables is a frontier area of computational research @xcite .",
    "our pair of polynomials , the quadratic @xmath171 and the cubic @xmath172 , can be expressed as a single order @xmath173 polynomial : @xmath174 .",
    "one of the best algorithmic bounds for the number of arithmetic steps to find a real root is exponential in the number of unknowns @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and so doubly exponential in the number of parties .      in the introductory remarks to this section we described a slightly different question which we would like to answer .",
    "what conditions must a set of parts of quantum states satisfy such that there exists a compatible quantum state ?    in the case of three qubits , rather than solving for @xmath162 for particular @xmath175 values ( as in section [ given ] ) , one would rather find the range of @xmath175 values such there always exist real @xmath162 satisfying ( [ r],[s ] ) .",
    "here one solves ( [ r],[s ] ) for general @xmath175 , eliminating @xmath162 , with the constraint that the variables are reals .",
    "finding rules that parts of quantum states must satisfy such there exists a whole is equivalent to solving a system of equations , in real variables , for a subset of those variables .",
    "both analytically and algorithmically this is a hard task .",
    "the first implementable algorithm for eliminating real variables from systems of equations was collins s @xcite ` cylindrical algebraic decomposition ' . in terms of",
    "the number of arithmetical steps required , this has a worst - case running time doubly exponential in the number of variables ( here the number of variables is the number of real coefficients in our decomposition , @xmath176 for @xmath0 @xmath10-dimensional subsystems ) .",
    "subsequent authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have produced theoretical algorithms that are singly exponential in the number of variables .",
    "it should be noted that this approach generalizes to @xmath0 parties , in higher dimensions and for different sets of parts of interest .    using a more advanced version of collins s algorithm @xcite we made a proof of principle in the simplest case .",
    "the conditions for two one - party reduced states @xmath177 and @xmath178 to be compatible with a two - party pure state are known : the eigenvalues of @xmath177 and @xmath178 must be the same .",
    "this is equivalent to the conditions @xmath179 .",
    "the algorithm showed that these are sufficient conditions by elimination of @xmath157 from simplified two party versions of ( [ r],[s ] ) @xcite ( showing necessity was not tractable during the time allocated ) . despite the unfavorable complexity of finding compatibility conditions algorithmically ,",
    "there is hope that , with optimized programs , advances can be made .",
    "known necessary conditions @xcite could be shown to be sufficient for small numbers of parties .    given these algorithmic challenges , it is natural to apply ad hoc techniques to solve specific sub - problems . a restricted form of the above question is whether a set of parts have a compatible _ pure state .",
    "there are two conditions which are necessary but , in general , not sufficient for a set of reduced states to be parts of a pure quantum states .",
    "( 1 ) as noted above , if the states have parties in common , their reduced states in these common parties alone must be the same .",
    "e.g. for @xmath180 and @xmath181 , @xmath182 .",
    "( 2 ) by the schmidt decomposition , pairs of reduced states which are a bipartite division of pure states must have the same eigenvalues . satisfying property ( 1 ) alone",
    "is insufficient for there to exist a compatible pure state : the set @xmath183 have consistent one party reduced states but there is no pure three party state with these reduced states  @xcite .",
    "both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are still not sufficient for a set of states to be compatible with a pure state .",

    "diosi @xcite notes that , by the schmidt decomposition , given any pair of overlapping reduced states of a pure state @xmath188 ( e.g. @xmath189 where systems @xmath131 might not be equidimensional ) the original state is almost always the only _ pure state compatible with them @xcite .",
    "we note that it is fairly straightforward to convert this result into a set of compatibility conditions which are necessary and sufficient for reduced states @xmath189 to be the reduced states of a pure state . _",
    "we have provided tight bounds on the size of the parts that are a sufficient description of almost all pure states and we have placed these questions in the framework of real algebraic geometry which is suitable for all such tasks involving parts of quantum states .",
    "the first part of this paper tells us that almost all pure quantum states contain no higher order correlations which are not determined by correlations within parts slightly bigger than half the whole state .",
    "exceptional states which do not have this property are of interest .",

    "<S> it is shown that generic @xmath0-party pure quantum states ( with equidimensional subsystems ) are uniquely determined by their reduced states of just over half the parties ; in other words , all the information in almost all @xmath0-party pure states is in the set of reduced states of just over half the parties . for @xmath0 even , the reduced states in fewer than @xmath1 parties are shown to be an insufficient description of almost all states ( similar results hold when @xmath0 is odd ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that real algebraic geometry is a natural framework for any analysis of parts of quantum states : two simple polynomials , a quadratic and a cubic , contain all of their structure . </S>",
    "<S> algorithmic techniques are described which can provide conditions for sets of reduced states to belong to pure or mixed states . </S>"
