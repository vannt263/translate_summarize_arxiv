    "in addition to triggering starbursts and active galactic nuclei , mergers of dusty , gas rich disk galaxies frequently lead to the formation of tidal tails that can stretch many disk diameters from the site of the collision ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these structures tend to be hi rich with blue optical colors , reflecting both their origin in the outer spiral disk and on - going star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that dwarf galaxies might form out of self - gravitating clumps within tidal tails , and indeed , concentrations of gas and star forming regions are commonly found there , ranging in size from super star clusters ( sscs , 10@xmath7m@xmath3 ) to tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs , @xmath8m@xmath3 ) .    tidal star forming knots ( tsfks ) and",
    "the formation of gravitationally bound tdgs , formed either via tidal interactions between the parent galaxies or from ram - sweeping of debris material , may play an important role in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "@xcite , hereafter hhm06 , found tidal bridges and tails associated with tdgs and tsfks in ngc 5291 , indicating further tidal interaction amongst the star forming knots .",
    "tdgs may be useful as local analogs of the multiple mergers of small dwarf - like galaxies at high redshift .",
    "more importantly , dwarf galaxies are the most common galaxy type in the current epoch , and tdgs may contribute significantly to this population in some environments , for example , in compact groups @xcite .",
    "here we present some new results from our spitzer study of star formation and the interstellar medium in nearby tidal streams ( saints ) .",
    "we have selected 12 pre - merger binary pairs with prominent optical tails and/or bridges ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is complemented by our study of two more complex systems : ngc  5291 where ram - sweeping is occurring in addition to a tidal interaction , and tsfks in stephan s quintet . using the spitzer 8 @xmath6 m images we have identified 62 tsfks .",
    "we discuss the infrared spectrometer ( irs , @xcite ) observations of seven bright tdg candidates along with the infrared array camera ( irac , @xcite ) and multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips , @xcite ) images of the full sample and address some key questions concerning the nature of tdgs and star formation in tidal streams .",
    "figure 1 shows the irs short - low ( irs - sl ) observations of ngc 5291  n and ngc 5291  s ( from hhm06 ) , sq - a & sq - b in stephan s quintet and ambartzumian s knot in arp 105 @xcite , and arp 242-n3 , and arp 87-n1 , the bridge star forming region in arp 87 .",
    "the tdgs / tsfks are rich in atomic and molecular emission features from the ism , including fine structure lines , e.g. , [ ne.2emii ] 12.81 @xmath6 m , [ ne.2emiii ] 15.56 @xmath6 m , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) and warm h@xmath4 .",
    "the mid - infrared spectra of dwarf galaxies are known to differ substantially from those of spirals , with weaker pah emission features and higher [ ne.2em iii]/[ne.2emii ] ratios @xcite .",
    "however , it is unknown whether the mid - infrared spectra of most tsfks more closely resemble those of spirals or dwarfs , since only a handful have been studied in detail with spitzer irs spectra to date ( e.g. , hhm06 ; @xcite ) . for the tdgs in ngc 5291",
    ", the spectra more closely resemble those of star forming dwarfs than spirals .",
    "the data was analyzed using smart @xcite and the strengths of the pah features were measured using pahfit @xcite . in the proceeding sections",
    "the results are used to address five questions .",
    "@xcite model the ratio of the 6.2 to 7.7 @xmath6 m features , which are both from c - c stretching modes , to derive the pah ion@xmath16grain size .",
    "the number of carbon atoms decreases as the ratio increases .",
    "the 11.3 @xmath6 m feature is from a c - h out of plane bending mode and the ratio of the 11.3 to 7.7 @xmath6 m band strength gives a measure of the pah ion fraction .",
    "the ratio of neutral to ionized pahs increases as the ratio increases .",
    "the pahs in the tsfks tend to have a strong c - h out - of - plane bending mode resulting in a mainly neutral population of pah grains .",
    "pah@xmath17 @xmath1 80 - 90 % in ambartzumian s knot , arp 242-n3 , sq - b and arp 87-n1 and around pah@xmath17 @xmath160 % in the remainder of the sample .",
    "arp 242-n3 and ambartzumian s knot in arp  105 have small pahs , n@xmath18 @xmath1 50 .",
    "the rest of the sample have larger pahs , n@xmath18 @xmath1100 ( the model fit to sq - a is not well constrained ) .",
    "the tsfks in sq - a and sq - b have [ s.2emiv]@xmath16[s.2em iii ]   and [ ne.2emiii]@xmath16[ne.2emii ] line ratios indicating moderate excitation consistent with our earlier results for ngc 5291 n and ngc 5291 s ( hhm06 ) and with the overlap region in the antennae @xcite .",
    "the isrf in tsfks is harder than typical starburst galaxies , being similar to that found in dwarfs , but softer than the isrfs found in the extreme low metallicity blue compact dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the neon line ratios in the tsfks are consistent with the starburst99 models in @xcite for a recent episode of star formation @xmath0 5 million years ago , i.e. , on - going star formation .",
    "we detect emission from @xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 of warm h@xmath4 in sq - a and arp  87-n1 and @xmath1 10@xmath5 m@xmath3 in sq - b .",
    "these results are similar to those derived by hhm06 for ngc 5291 n and ngc 5291 s ( hhm06 ) the warm h@xmath19 masses of @xmath20m@xmath3 are about 100 - 1000 times smaller than the average warm molecular mass of 2 @xmath21 @xmath22 m@xmath3 measured in a sample of 59 ulirgs @xcite , but the results for both galaxy types are consistent with an origin in photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "figure 2 shows three examples of the 3.6 @xmath6 m and 8 @xmath6 m images for arp 105 , arp 242 ( the mice ) and stephan s quintet .",
    "the locations of the tsfks are indicated with white circles on the figures .",
    "95% of the sources in the 14 systems have a `` notched '' irac sed characteristic of star forming regions .",
    "79% have 24 @xmath6 m detections or meaningful upper limits .",
    "these are classified into four groups depending on the 8 - 24 @xmath6 m slope .",
    "there are 18 rising ( f@xmath23 ) , 12 declining sed ( f@xmath24 ) , 9 flat / slowly rising ( f@xmath25 and f@xmath26 ) , and 8 flat / slowly declining ( f@xmath27 and f@xmath28 ) .",
    "the rising sed is typical of spiral and starburst galaxies with a dominant 40 @xmath15 60 k dust component and the declining sed probably indicates a dominant hot dust component .",
    "far - infrared observations are needed to confirm this interpretation .",
    "figure 3 shows that tsfks form two distinct clumps on an irac 2-color diagram .",

    "this population overlaps with the majority of the kiss dwarfs and the spiral galaxies from pahre s sample .",
    "the redder @xmath10 $ ] - @xmath11 $ ] population tends to have the sources with a rising 8 - 24 @xmath6 m sed while the blue population tends to contain the sources with a descending sed .",
    "preliminary stellar masses are estimated using the 4.5 @xmath6 m data ( e.g. , @xcite ) and assuming minimal non - stellar emission in the band .",
    "we find a median m@xmath29 = 10@xmath9 m@xmath3 , with a wide range : 4.0 @xmath21 10@xmath2 to 1.3 @xmath21 10@xmath30 m@xmath3 .",
    "the 18 rising sources have a median stellar mass of 1.0 @xmath21 10@xmath9 m@xmath3 .",
    "the 12 declining sources have a higher median stellar mass of 4.0 @xmath21 10@xmath9 m@xmath3 .",
    "half of the declining sources are in arp 242 , which probably biases the median stellar mass to be greater than the average for the whole sample .",
    "the sources with flat or slowly rising / declining seds have stellar masses similar to that of the rising sources .",
    "the stellar mass , with some scatter , tends to scale with the 8 @xmath6 m luminosity . for a given 8 @xmath6 m luminosity",
    "the kiss dwarfs have a more massive stellar component .",
    "the median stellar mass for the kiss dwarfs is 1.0 @xmath21 10@xmath30 m@xmath3 , which is a factor of ten larger than the median value for the tsfks .",
    "6/8 tsfks in arp 242 have declining seds .",
    "four of these tsfks overlap with 3 of the dwarfs from the kiss sample .",
    "studies of tdgs and smaller knots of star formation in tidal features help us better understand the dwarf galaxy population as a whole .",

    "the study of these systems is still in its infancy as few have been studied in detail .",
    "the next generation of telescopes , for example herschel , jwst and alma offer the promise of studying both fainter objects and larger samples .",
    "in particular , such studies will provide information about what fraction are truly primordial building blocks of massive galaxies left over from an early epoch of galaxy formation , and what fraction may have been born in tidal interactions . in time we will perform a more comprehensive census of star formation and the interstellar medium in tidal streams and be able to refine models of both intergalactic enrichment and star formation triggering and regulation ."
