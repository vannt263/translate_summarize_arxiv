    "the star formation process in our galaxy , including how both low- and high - mass stars are formed , is important to study as it determines how we view galaxies and how stars and planets are created .",
    "decade long efforts have made significant progress , although the full details are yet to be realised .",
    "in particular , the formation of high - mass stars is difficult to study as they form in complex cluster environments that are rare . although the formation of low - mass stars either in clusters or in isolation is more accessible , it is still difficult to define a self - consistent detailed model that accounts for the wide variety of observational phenomena associated with the formation of stars of all masses @xcite .",
    "+ in essence , our difficulties in understanding the star formation process are largely associated with our limited ability to study catalogued examples , each of which can only tell us about how star formation looks at one specific location . with a large ensemble of star formation examples to study ,",
    "there is the promise that all the examples can be put together to form a coherent picture .",
    "however , the cataloguing process necessarily introduces biases into any ensemble , which must be taken into account .",
    "therefore , we need to study the full population of star forming sites throughout the galaxy , in order to form a full picture of the star formation process .",
    "such a grand catalogue is difficult to realise and so in recent years an alternate approach has been explored .",
    "this approach is to conduct untargetted surveys of the galaxy , using many different galactic plane surveys , each of which focus on a particular aspect relevant to star formation and then complement the data with theoretical models to help us astrophysically interpret the data .",
    "the untargetted approach allows the observer to find the full population of objects within their survey , rather than picking out selected targets from another survey , with its own biases .",
    "many different galactic plane surveys are required in this approach because each untargetted survey may only observe a select aspect of the star formation process .",
    "a classic example of this is the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) point source catalog @xcite , which proved extremely useful in identifying all the bright and red far - infrared sources within the galaxy @xcite which are typically associated with high - mass star formation .",
    "however , early stages of high - mass star formation take place in infrared - dark clouds ( irdcs  @xcite ) and so were not detected by iras .",
    "thus , iras could only be used to identify star formation sites that were reasonably well evolved , but still embedded in their natal molecular clouds .",
    "+ currently , there are many untargetted galactic plane surveys that are relevant to star formation .",
    "there are continuum surveys from short to long wavelengths including : the near - infrared ( eg . 2mass  @xcite , ukidss ",
    "@xcite ) , mid - infrared ( eg . msx ",
    "@xcite , glimpse ",
    "@xcite , mipsgal ",
    "@xcite ) , far - infrared and sub - millimetre ( iras  @xcite , hi - gal  @xcite , atlasgal ",
    "@xcite ) , millimetre ( eg . bgps ",
    "@xcite ) and centimetre ( eg . cornish ",
    "@xcite , vgps ",
    "@xcite , sgps ",
    "@xcite , cgps ",
    "these continuum surveys allow a wide range of physical conditions to be probed , from ionised gas to hot gas and dust to cold dust .",
    "in addition to the continuum surveys , there are also spectral line surveys , which can be used as diagnostics of particular aspects of the star formation process : co ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , cs ( malt-45  @xcite ) , nh@xmath1 ( hops  @xcite ) , oh ( eg . splash ",
    "@xcite ) and hi ( eg . sgps ",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned spectral line surveys are spectral line surveys of strong masers : class i methanol masers ( eg .",
    "malt-45 @xcite ) , water masers ( eg . hops ",
    "@xcite ) , class ii methanol masers ( eg . mmb",
    " @xcite ) and oh masers ( eg .",
    "all these surveys can help build a detailed picture of the star formation process whilst minimising inherent biasses in sample selection .",
    "+      oh masers are commonly found in the later stages of stellar evolution , particularly during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase and shortly thereafter .",
    "the agb phase occurs for stars with masses 1 - 8m@xmath2 where the main supply of nuclear fuel ( hydrogen ) in the core is exhausted .",
    "the outer atmosphere is expelled from the surface of the star in a dense stellar wind that expands isotropically at typical velocities of 5 - 30kms@xmath3 , forming an envelope .",
    "the expanding circumstellar envelope can harbour masers from sio , h@xmath4o and oh , with sio masers found closest to the star and oh masers found furthest away , which is probably due to the differing excitation temperatures of the masing transitions @xcite .",
    "+ oh masers that occur in the circumstellar envelopes are typified by a double - horned profile , where the outer edges , showing the strongest maser emission , are indicative of red - shifted and blue - shifted gas moving behind and in front of the central star , respectively .",
    "thus , the oh maser profile may be used to characterise the kinematics of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "this distinctive profile also allows the easy identification of oh masers associated with evolved stars .",
    "+ eventually , the star evolves from the agb stage into a planetary nebula ( pn ) , through a very short - lived ( @xmath5 years ; @xcite ) post - agb phase . during this evolution ,",
    "the masers that originate in the circumstellar envelope are extinguished .",
    "the sio masers turn off first , followed by h@xmath4o masers , leaving the oh masers to disappear last .",
    "most pne are observed to be highly asymmetric .",
    "it is not entirely understood how the symmetric agb star and attendant envelope evolve into an asymmetric pn .",
    "a possible method is that high velocity bipolar jets are formed during the post - agb phase that impinge on the nearly - symmetric circumstellar envelope , where small density variations create the asymmetric pn @xcite .",
    "both h@xmath4o and oh masers are seen to trace such jets in the post - agb phase ( eg .",
    "these high velocity jets are exceedingly rare , due to their extremely short lifetimes .",
    "+ another exceedingly rare class of objects associated with evolved stars are ohpne @xcite .",
    "these objects show radio continuum emission associated with a pn , but also show oh maser emission .",
    "it is likely that this phase occurs when the pn phase has just started , with the inner part of the circumstellar envelope already ionised , but the outer parts harbouring oh masers . + it is therefore important that we increase the numbers of known examples of these rare , short - lived phases through maser surveys so that we can study these important phases of stellar evolution",
    ". +        in the literature , some confusion exists over terminology used to describe various aspects of maser emission .",
    "in particular , the term `` maser spot '' has multiple definitions .",
    "for example , @xcite give a definition in terms of methanol masers as : `` a methanol maser spectrum typically consists of many peaks .",
    "each peak corresponds to a well - defined position in the sky , referred to as a maser spot .",
    "maser spots are usually seen to cluster on a scale of less than 1 arcsec .",
    "these clusters are referred to as maser sites . ''",
    "however , an alternate definition is provided by @xcite , who in turn cite @xcite as : `` a maser spot is a single velocity component of the maser emission .",
    "a maser feature is a group of the maser spots with similar positions ( within several hundred microarcseconds ) and with successive velocities ( with spacings 0.33kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "spots thus reflect somewhat instrumental factors , especially the velocity spacing of each channel . ''",
    "+ the important difference between these definitions is that a maser spot in the first definition is essentially the same as a maser feature in the second definition .",
    "but there is no equivalent to the maser spot used by @xcite . whilst different definitions may be common in fields of research",
    ", it appears that both definitions of maser spot are in common usage within the maser community . furthermore",
    ", much work is published where maser spot and maser feature are used interchangably .",
    "thus there is a strong need to consolidate terminology amongst researchers to avoid future confusion .",
    "+ the term `` maser hot spot '' was introduced by @xcite in response to high spatial resolution observations by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite , for example , observed oh masers in w3 and found `` knots of radiation '' , corresponding to single peaks in the spectrum , where the `` ratio of separation to size is typically 100 to 1 . ''",
    "the sizes of the maser hot spots in these observations were around @xmath8 cm ( @xmath9au ) , whereas typical separations were around @xmath10 cm .",
    "the terminology `` maser hot spot '' by @xcite was introduced to highlight that the masers originated in small regions of the sky where it was thought a single parcel of gas was responsible for the exceedingly high brightness temperatures that were measured .",
    "this terminology was quickly contracted by subsequent authors to `` maser spot '' and became common usage .",
    "+ the observations by @xcite identified that a maser spot ( using the definition of @xcite ) may break up into substructures that are found to have slightly ( but significant ) different positions for each channel in the data that was analysed .",
    "thus , the terminology was changed to highlight that a maser feature corresponds to a physical entity that typically corresponds to a single peak in a spectrum and a maser spot became the name assigned to the substructure evident between single channels of a spectrum and within a single maser feature .",
    "however , this new terminology means that a maser spot is governed by instrumental effects ( ie .",
    "the channel resolution ) , rather than corresponding to a single parcel of gas at a well defined position that gives rise to a single peak in the spectrum .",
    "thus , the term maser spot loses its meaning in the context of a hot spot .",
    "+ in this work , we use the term maser spot in keeping with its original definition as a contraction of maser hot spot which constitutes a single peak in the spectrum .",
    "such maser spots are expected to have sizes around @xmath8 cm and are occasionally grouped into regions with sizes around @xmath10 cm , which we call maser sites .",
    "however we note that , given our spatial resolution and typical distances to masers , maser spots will be unresolved in our work",
    ". indeed , most maser sites will also remain unresolved in this work .",
    "we remind the reader that our definition of `` maser spot '' is in common usage as either `` maser feature '' or `` maser component '' in other work . +",
    "we mapped a @xmath11 field around w43 ( @xmath12 = 29.2@xmath1331.5@xmath0 , @xmath14 ) during the 2012a semester with the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) in new mexico in c - configuration ( project 12a-161 ) . the phase centre of the observations was @xmath15 .",
    "the primary beam at 1667mhz has a fwhm of 27 .",
    "a total of 59 pointings were used to cover the 4 square degree mosaic . with a broad frequency coverage between 1 and 2ghz ,",
    "the primary beam sampling is a compromise between sampling density and area coverage . for the pilot region",
    "detailed in this work , we used a mosaicing scheme consisting of a hexagonal grid with 17.9  spacing .",
    "this results in excellent data quality with very little variation in sensitivity in the inner survey region .",
    "however , for the full survey , we improved the sampling to 15  spacing , using a square grid so that the data are nyquist sampled at the hi  line frequency ( 1.42ghz ) .",
    "+ each pointing was observed @xmath16 minutes , resulting in an overall observation time of 10 hours .",
    "the observations were conducted in two blocks each with 5 hours observing time in april 2012 .",
    "we chose the quasar 3c286 as a flux and bandpass calibrator and the quasar j1822 - 0938 as a complex gain calibrator , which was observed every 13 minutes . observing at l - band and using the new widar correlator",
    ", we were able to simultaneously observe the hi line , the 4 oh lines ( 1612 , 1665 , 1667 and 1720mhz ) and 12 h@xmath17 radio recombination lines .",
    "the continuum , detected in eight spectral windows between 1 and 2ghz , was observed in full polarisation .",
    "the spectral lines were only observed in ll and rr polarisations .",
    "however , we only present stokes i information on the oh lines in this work . for the oh lines , we used a bandwidth of 1mhz with a channel width of 3.906 khz .",
    "this results in a velocity range of about 180kms@xmath3 and a channel spacing of 0.73kms@xmath3 at 1612mhz .",
    "+ we use a synthesised beam of @xmath18 . with this beam , we estimate the absolute positional accuracy is @xmath19 @xcite where @xmath20 is the beam size ( 20 ) and snr is the signal to noise ratio . under typical observing conditions",
    ", we conservatively expect the absolute positional accuracy to be no better than 10 per cent of the beam ( ie .",
    "2 ) . with a typical rms noise level of 19mjy / beam per 0.73kms@xmath3  channel ( see section 3.1 for further details ) , this means that for any point source stronger than @xmath21 , the absolute accuracy will be 2 . for weaker point sources , the accuracy will be lower and will follow @xmath22 .",
    "we also note that the noise level increases where there is a nearby strong maser source in the same channel .",
    "this is because the data have a limited dynamic range of about 900 in the presence of strong sources .",
    "+      to edit and calibrate the data , we used casa ( version 4.1.0 ) with a modified vla pipeline 1 ( version 1.2.0 ) .",
    "the pipeline does automatic flagging for eg .",
    "zeros or shadowing of antennas .",
    "additional flagging for radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and bad antennas was done manually .",
    "the pipeline also applies the bandpass , flux and complex gain calibrations to the data .",
    "we do not use hanning smoothing and do not recalculate the data weights at the end of the pipeline .",
    "we subsequently perform further flagging and editing by hand . more details on the calibration of the pilot study",
    "are also given in @xcite .",
    "a full description of our quality check method will be presented in our forthcoming overview paper ( beuther et al .",
    ", _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "maser sites were identified in a similar fashion as the methods described in @xcite .",
    "we initially used the duchamp software @xcite package to identify maser candidates .",
    "the data cubes contain pixels ( 5 ) that are approximately four times smaller than the fwhm size of the restoring beam ( 20 ) and the channel width is 0.73kms@xmath3 .",
    "based on these specifications for the data cubes , we used duchamp to search for emission at twice the rms noise level , which is typically 19mjy / beam , in the full cubes , with the following minimum thresholds for detection : no less than 12 pixels in a single channel , no less than 25 voxels and no less than 2 consecutive channels over which the emission was above the 2@xmath23 level .",
    "this effectively constrains a detection to occur at above the 2@xmath23 level in each of as many pixels would fill half a beam for each of two consecutive channels in the cube . by varying these input parameters and comparing the results , we found this to be the best compromise to maximise the number of real detections made , whilst simultaneously limiting the number of false detections .",
    "we also found that , within reasonable limits , the number of real and false detections did not change greatly when varying the input parameters slightly .",
    "this gives us confidence that our input parameters are reasonably robust .",
    "+ during our initial duchamp searches , it became clear that such automated source finding was limited by the changing noise levels in the data .",
    "in particular , the edges of the survey area had higher noise levels in all channels , but also , the limited dynamic range ( approximately up to 900 ) close to very strong masers significantly increases the noise , in the images containing strong emission .",
    "the effect on duchamp results was that many more false detections would be made . in order to mitigate the effects of changing noise levels ,",
    "a noise map was created for each data cube , based on averaging data over a velocity range where no masers were expected ( -110 to -70kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "this full data cube was divided by the noise map , effectively creating a signal - to - noise cube , which was then searched for sources in duchamp .",
    "+ figure [ 1612noise ] shows a peak flux density map for the 1612mhz data cube ( top ) and a signal - no - noise peak flux density map ( bottom ) .",
    "the top map shows increased noise levels at the edges , as well as sidelobe patterns from the strongest masers , with the strongest located at g31.102 - 0.219 .",
    "the signal - to - noise map shows improvement , particularly along the edges of the survey area .",
    "however , the sidelobes from strong masers remain .",
    "these maser sidelobes occur in only one or two channels of the data cube .",
    "we find that within a primary beam ( about 0.25@xmath0 ) of a strong maser , any other potential masers are hidden within the sidelobes .",
    "however , this is only the case for one or two channels that are strongly affected . at other channels , we are able to search for potential masers that are close ( in the plane of the sky ) to a strong maser , but at a different velocity . +        in order to confirm detections by duchamp as real masers , we visually inspected each duchamp detection .",
    "nearly all false detections can be identified as sidelobes from nearby strong masers .",
    "in addition to identifying masers through confirmation of duchamp detections , we also visually inspected the data cubes and moment maps , using the hopsfind method of which more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "this method was particularly successful for the 1612mhz data cube as 1612mhz masers , when associated with evolved stars , often display a characteristic double - horned profile in their spectra ( signifying an expanding shell containing the masing gas ) , which is easy to identify by eye , even at low signal - to - noise levels .",
    "+ for each identified maser spot , we use the miriad task `` imfit '' to fit the emission and derive positions and relative uncertainties , as well as peak flux densities .",
    "we derive the velocity minima and maxima for maser spots by visually inspecting the data cubes and determining over which channels emission is seen .",
    "+      the completeness limit of the vla observations will vary depending on the noise level . in a region of the data that overlaps in velocity with a bright maser and",
    "is spatially close to the maser , the sidelobe noise level will be high and the completeness will have a correspondingly low value .",
    "given that oh masers associated with star formation are likely to be clustered within the same star formation site , it is also likely that the number of masers will be slightly underestimated because these high noise regions surrounding bright masers will contain a higher density of masers .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to accurately compute a single completeness level , but it makes more sense to compute completeness levels as a function of changing noise levels .",
    "+ the noise levels at which 10 , 50 , 90 and 95 per cent of the data are below this level are 11 , 19 , 22 and 27mjy / beam per 0.73kms@xmath3 channel , respectively .",
    "we use these noise levels as representative of the data and apply these noise levels to a monte carlo simulation . in the simulation ,",
    "we take representative data with noise at each of these levels and artificially inject point sources into the noisy data .",
    "the point sources have a line width typical of masers : 2kms@xmath3 .",
    "we then use our same source - finding methods described above and count the number of recovered point sources . we can then plot four distributions of the completeness levels , as shown in figure [ complete ] .",
    "+        the completeness distributions show that nearly all data is complete at around the level of 0.25jy / beam , but that 50 per cent of the data is complete at around the level of 0.17jy / beam .",
    "the detected masers are detailed in table [ maintable ] and their positions and spectra are shown in figure [ images ] .",
    "we find a total of 276 maser spots ( 128 at 1612mhz , 72 at 1665mhz , 72 at 1667mhz , and 4 at 1720mhz ) .",
    "the brightest maser spot has a peak flux density of 124.7jy and the weakest 19mjy .",

    "of the 12 diffuse oh sites , all but three ( g30.533 + 0.021 , g30.854 + 0.151 and g31.388 - 0.382 ) show main - line absorption and well - detected satellite line features that are approximate mirror images of each other .",
    "the remaining sites also show main - line absorption , but with weak or absent detections in one or both of the satellites .",
    "+ we note that the intensity ratios of the main - lines vary somewhat , with many showing departures from the 5:9 ratio ( 1665:1667 ) expected from an optically thin gas in lte .",
    "this behaviour is expected to arise either from optical depth effects or from a pattern of excitation temperatures that strongly departs from thermal , with the actual line strengths also set by the difference between these excitation temperatures and the continuum background ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "+ we also note that some of the spectral features in figure [ diffuseoh ] are likely due to the blending of strong maser emission with diffuse oh features .",
    "for example , there are narrow emission features in both the 1665 and 1667mhz spectra of g30.815 - 0.053 that do not have any corresponding features in the satellite lines , suggesting that they are the result of high - gain maser action from a localised parcel ( or parcels ) of gas with strong velocity coherence , and not from the wider diffuse medium . +",
    "as shown in table [ diffuseohtab ] , all but one of the diffuse oh detections are co - spatial with sites of star formation , which may host the molecular gas that gives rise to the diffuse oh , and may also provide the bright continuum background against which the features may be clearly seen .",
    "indeed , most of the diffuse oh is associated with the well known star forming region w43 main and only the features of g31.388 - 0.382 are not associated with an established star formation site .",
    "+ figure [ absfig ] shows the morphology of the 1667mhz oh absorption in the w43 main region , in which extended oh absorption is seen against the continuum emission from w43 main .",
    "the figure shows the maximum optical depth measured at each position .",
    "this is calculated from a data cube that contains both the 1667mhz transition , as well as continuum emission ( ie .",
    "not continuum subtracted ) .",
    "maximum optical depth is calculated from the velocity channel that shows the maximum difference between the continuum level ( measured at a velocity where there is no oh emission or absorption ) and the level at the deepest absorption feature in the spectrum .",
    "+ we note that the morphology of the optical depth does not match that of the continuum emission .",
    "this is expected behaviour because the continuum emission represents the morphology of w43 main , but the oh that absorbs the continuum originates in a cloud that does not necessarily have the same morphology as the continuum emission .",
    "it is not clear if this cloud is an unrelated foreground object , or related to the front envelope of w43 main . given that the velocity of the absorption is close to that expected of w43 main , we consider it more likely that this is part of a foreground envelope . +",
    "most of the region with significant oh absorption shows optical depths around 0.2 , indicating that the oh is generally optically thin gas .",
    "there are , however , small areas where the optical depth is significantly higher . from this",
    "we assume that the oh gas is likely to be optically thin in all but the densest regions , closely linked to star formation centres , like w43 main .",
    "+ the extended absorption towards w43 main appears to be the only place in the thor pilot region where we detect significantly extended oh absorption ; the other detections in table [ diffuseohtab ] and figure [ diffuseoh ] are all either spatially unresolved or partially resolved regions .",
    "it is expected to see only extended oh absorption towards w43 main because this is the only region within the field of view which shows strong , extended continuum emission and such continuum emission is required in order to see the oh absorption .",
    "the optical depth in these unresolved regions again appears to be about 0.2 , indicating that optically thin oh is typical .",
    "in the thor pilot region , we have conducted a search for oh emission and absorption . we have adapted a previous simple search method to identify sites of strong emission and successfully applied it to identify maser sites .",
    "we found strong maser emission is common throughout the field , with 1612mhz masers being the most common and 1720mhz masers being the rarest . in all",
    ", we found 103 sites of strong maser emission within the pilot survey region .",
    "+ by comparing our results with previous oh maser observations , we find that main - line oh masers occasionally show mild variability up to a factor of a few over a period of years .",
    "oh masers in the 1612mhz satellite line also show occasional variability on similar timescales , but we also identify a small number of these maser that show strong variability with order of magnitude changes in intensity over a period of a few years .",

    "we find that the maser emission from g31.128 - 1.015 is detected over the entirety of a very large velocity range of 145.3kms@xmath3 .",
    "+ we also detect diffuse oh emission and absorption against locations of bright background continuum . extended oh absorption is seen towards the well known star - forming region w43 main , while unresolved or partially resolved detections are seen elsewhere .",
    "the oh gas generally appears to be optically thin .",
