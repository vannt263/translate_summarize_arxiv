    "supernovae and supernova remnants ( snr ) are a significant by - product of the intense star - formation found in starburst galaxies . as such",
    ", they play an important role in galaxy evolution and the feedback of material into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and collectively via energy deposition into the ism can drive massive superwinds as can be found in nearby galaxies such as m82 @xcite .",
    "individual snr are interesting in their own right and have been the subject of intense study for decades ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , a population of snr within a galaxy can provide information on the statistical properties of snr evolution within the interstellar medium , as well as provide insight into the star - formation history of the galaxy via independent tracers of the supernova and star - formation rates .",
    "detailed investigations of snr within the galaxy are hindered both by the difficulty in determining accurate distances , and by the fact that all known galactic snr are over 150 years old @xcite .",
    "the use of radio interferometry allows high resolution observations of a starburst region and reveals sources that are otherwise obscured by the high levels of gas and dust associated with the star formation .",
    "in addition , such studies are free from selection effects as all of the snr are at essentially the same distance and are observed with the same angular resolution and brightness sensitivity .    for these reasons ,",
    "a number of starburst galaxies have been well - studied using radio interferometric techniques , for example the southern hemisphere starburst galaxy , ngc253 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the more distant intense starburst of arp220 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , as one of closest starburst galaxies , m82 ( @xmath03.2mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) presents a unique opportunity for a more detailed investigation of a young population of snr .",
    "the first detailed radio observations of m82 , began in the 1970s @xcite with the discovery of several compact sources within the central kpc .",
    "subsequent observations ( @xcite ; kronberg , biermann & schwab 1985 ; @xcite ) have shown these to be part of a population of supernova remnants and regions now approaching 100 identified sources .",
    "merlin observations of m82 have revealed the parsec - scale , shell - like structures of a large portion of these sources @xcite at 5ghz , though detailed observations at lower frequencies have been limited by the achievable resolutions and brightness temperature sensitivities of available interferometers .",
    "high angular resolution observations using the european vlbi network ( evn ) , at a frequency of 1.7ghz began in 1997 utilising previous 1.4ghz observations from 1986 , in order to observe and monitor the five most compact sources within m82 .",
    "this began a now established global vlbi monitoring programme of these compact sources .",
    "the fifth epoch of this programme are presented here , extending the timeline of these observations to 19-yrs .",
    "however , these purely vlbi observations lack the surface brightness sensitivity to image all but the most compact objects . to remedy this in this work we present results from the first combined , simultaneous merlin and global vlbi observations of m82 , which have enabled high surface brightness imaging at mas resolutions of the wider population of snr and regions .",
    "we present the results of these combined observations in this paper .",
    "the detected population of sources is discussed in section [ pop ] .",
    "the most compact sources are discussed individually as observed in the global vlbi only observations along with a detailed investigation of the possible deceleration of 43.31 + 59.2 in section [ expsec ] .",
    "section [ ism ] discusses the supernova remnant environment in m82 and a summary is provided in section [ sum ] .",
    "this paper includes observations of m82 at 1.7ghz using both merlin and global vlbi as well as archival global vlbi and evn observations from 1986 , 1997 , 1998 and 2001 .",
    "observations of m82 were performed with seven telescopes , of the merlin array on the 3rd mar .",
    "2005 , at a frequency of 1.7ghz .",
    "global vlbi observations were made simultaneously at the same frequency and included use of the ten telescopes of the vlba ( very long baseline array ) in the usa as well as westerbork , medecina , noto and effelsberg antennas from the european vlbi network ( evn ) .",
    "the global vlbi data also incorporated information from two merlin telescopes ; the 76-m lovell and 32-m cambridge telescopes .",
    "the observations were made over a period of 18 hours with both the merlin and global vlbi arrays switching between m82 and the same phase calibration source j0958 + 65 ; this facilitates the combination of the two separate datasets .",
    "the global vlbi data covers a range in frequency of 1.6595 - 1.6755ghz , split over 128 channels , each 250khz in width .",
    "the data were correlated at jive ( joint institute for vlbi in europe ) centred on the position of the most compact radio source 41.95 + 57.5 . all subsequent data reduction and imaging",
    "was performed using the nrao s software .",
    "amplitude calibration was performed using the system temperature and gain information provided for each telescope .",
    "the final delays , fringe rates and antenna gains were found for the calibration sources j0958 + 65 and j0927 + 39 and then applied to the target source , m82 .    .observing information for the 1.7ghz observations made on mar .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ num ]    in addition to the known thermal regions , extensive regions of molecular and ionised gas have been identified within the central kpc of m82 from the 92ghz continuum studies by @xcite , where the emission is dominated by free - free emission , as well as via radio recombination line ( rrl ) observations ( ( e.g .",
    "the 1.7 and 5ghz rrls in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as those presented by @xcite ) .",
    "low frequency observations of m82 @xcite , have shown the presence of significant free - free absorption by ionised gas .",
    "the most striking example of this is the large ` hole ' observed at 408mhz and 327mhz , roughly centred on the source 41.95 + 57.5 and approximately 100pc in diameter .",
    "@xcite attribute this to free - free absorption from a large region ionised by a cluster of early - type stars .",
    "analysis of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) have been performed for a number of the sources within m82 such as those by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these are used to distinguish the flat spectrum regions from the steep spectrum snr .",
    "such studies also include modelling of the free - free absorption seen for individual sources providing an estimate of the amount of ionised gas along the line of sight via the emission measure .",
    "the spectrum of a number of sources show low - frequency turnovers , in the case of snr suggesting free - free absorption , indicating that some of the snr are located either within or even behind the ionised gas .",
    "a total of nine of the known snr within m82 show a turnover in their spectrum at frequencies greater than 1.7ghz , eight of which have been detected in these observations and have reduced flux densities consistent with this picture .",
    "whilst not detected in these observations , the snr 43.81 + 62.8 has been detected at a number of frequencies and was suggested to have a turnover frequency of @xmath02 - 3ghz by @xcite via a spectral analysis incorporating observations from 0.408 , 5 and 8.3ghz @xcite .",
    "however , later observations reported in @xcite at similar frequencies suggest the flux density of this source to have increased . in addition ,",
    "merlin observations at 1.4ghz in 1995 @xcite give a flux density of 2.1@xmath10.8mjy , compared to an upper limit of 0.2mjy@xmath2 in these observations .",
    "it is therefore difficult to attribute the lack of detection of this snr to free - free absorption alone , as it may well be a result of its apparent variability .",
    "there are twenty previously identified regions in m82 , all but two of which have been shown to be or become optically thick above 1.7ghz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , only two of the regions expected to be in the optically thick regime have been detected in the combined 1.7ghz observations , the remainder having predicted flux densities below the image noise level .",
    "the regions 45.63 + 66.9 and 43.21 + 61.3 identified by @xcite , have a spectral index of @xmath0 - 0.04 between 8.3 and 43ghz .",
    "the lack of detection here would suggest that these sources also become optically thick at a frequency greater than 1.7ghz .",
    "the low - resolution image produced from the merlin - only data has a 1@xmath3 brightness temperature sensitivity limit of @xmath01500k .",
    "there is emission at the 2 - 3@xmath3 level in this merlin - only image for two of the regions expected to be optically thick , though they are undetected in the merlin+global vlbi images .",
    "this would suggest that the low brightness temperature sensitivity of the combined data may also be a contributing factor to the lack of detection of some of the regions .",
    "it is possible to use these observations to make an independent estimate of the supernova and star formation rates in m82 , enabling a comparative measurement to those performed elsewhere , both from radio and other wavelength observations .",
    "the simplest method of calculating the supernova rate using snr in m82 is by comparison to the galactic remnant cassiopeia a , which has a known age of @xmath0325 years ( age in 2004 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . assuming that the observed snr in m82 which are more luminous than cassiopeia a are therefore younger , the supernova rate can be calculated as the number of snr divided by the age of cassiopeia a. taking a flux density for cassiopeia a of 1894jy ( extrapolated from the 1ghz value using a spectral index of @xmath4 , from ( observation date 1999 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , this provides 12 m82 snr and a resulting supernova rate of @xmath5 . this is lower than that measured from merlin 5ghz observations ( @xmath00.07@xmath6 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though this is likely to be a result of free - free absorption causing low - frequency turnovers in the snr spectrum ( see section [ ion ] ) .",
    "the supernova rate can also be determined from the cumulative size distribution of the supernova remnants , shown in fig .",
    "[ cum18 cm ] .",
    "as discussed in section [ dec ] , the evolution of the diameter of a snr with time can be modelled by @xmath7 , where m is the deceleration parameter and k is a constant .",
    "if it is assumed that this applies to all of the snr in our sample , the cumulative distribution ( n(@xmath8d)-d relation ) will follow @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the supernova rate .",
    "if the snr are following free expansion , the cumulative distribution can be modelled using a value of @xmath11 .",
    "this , for the 1.7ghz cumulative distribution can be fitted to diameters with d@xmath82.5pc and provides an estimate of @xmath12 for the supernova rate , where @xmath13 is the expansion velocity .",
    "assuming an expansion velocity of @xmath05000 , gives a supernova rate of @xmath14 , in good agreement with those calculated at other radio wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as those predicted by models of the starburst such as @xcite .",
    "2.5pc.,width=302 ]    assuming a miller - scalo @xcite initial - mass function ( represented by a power - law with a constant slope given by @xmath15 ) , these supernova rates can be used to estimate the star - formation rate for m82 , giving sfr(@xmath16 ) @xmath0 1.25 - 2.25 @xmath17 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the @xmath18@xmath17 measurements at other radio wavelengths as well as using fir , uv and h@xmath19 ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the interstellar medium within m82 is believed to be more extreme than in the milky way , with pressures of @xmath20 observed within the central star - forming region @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of m82 , such as those of @xcite assume such ism pressures , along with densities of @xmath21 to predict expansion velocities for the observed snr of @xmath0500 , which is in stark contrast to those observed , in particular for the snr 43.31 + 58.2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* this paper ) .",
    "if the snr are assumed to be situated within the ionised gas with temperatures of @xmath22k , ambient gas densities of @xmath21 are required to provide the level of pressure observed .",
    "@xcite alternatively assume that the majority of snr are evolving into the interclump medium of molecular clouds , citing the association of strong co emission with the observed radio emission as a good indication of this .",
    "however , @xcite conclude that most of the co emission from the central regions of m82 arises from a warm , low density interclump medium with kinetic temperatures of @xmath0150k and densities @xmath21 in agreement with previous studies such as @xcite .",
    "more recent investigations using formaldehyde line transitions to independently constrain the properties of the dense molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find kinetic gas temperatures of @xmath0200k and densities of @xmath23 in strong agreement with the co studies .",
    "such temperatures and gas densities imply pressures of @xmath24 , between one and two orders of magnitude lower than those assumed by @xcite .    following the free expansion phase ,",
    "a supernova remnant is expected to enter the sedov phase of its evolution when the mass of swept - up material becomes equivalent to the mass of the ejecta . for an snr ,",
    "this is expected to occur whilst interacting with a constant density ism , at a radius @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the ejecta mass in units of 10 and @xmath27 is the ism density in @xmath28 . in the case of 43.31 + 59.2",
    ", this stage of evolution has not yet been reached ( as shown in section [ expsec ] ) , hence an upper limit to the surrounding density can be set of @xmath29 , for an ejecta mass of 5 .",
    "this would suggest that for the required pressures , 43.31 + 59.2 is not likely to be situated within the ionised gas , a conclusion supported by the lack of low frequency turnover observed in its spectra @xcite .",
    "it has previously been suggested that the low density environment that 43.31 + 59.2 appears to be experiencing , may be a result of a wind - blown bubble from the mass - loss of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "the snr in m82 are expected to be the result of core - collapse supernova events of massive progenitors ( typically @xmath30 8) .",
    "most stars with masses @xmath30 11will become red supergiants ( rsg ) in their final stages of evolution and are believed to be the progenitors of the majority of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "such stars ( typically ob stars ) , undergo mass - loss during their main - sequence phase with expected terminal velocities of @xmath31 3000and rates of @xmath32 ( ( e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "the subsequent mass - loss during the red - supergiant phase is expected to be slower and more dense , with typical mass - loss rates of @xmath33@xmath17 and wind velocities of @xmath8100(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence prior to the eventual supernova explosion , there will be a complex circumstellar environment consisting of stellar - wind material from various evolutionary stages as well as potentially a collapsed region .",
    "modelling of the pre - supernova circumstellar environment for red - supergiants indicates that there will be a region of rsg wind close to the progenitor with a density profile given by @xmath34 , reaching distances of a few parsecs @xcite .",
    "this will be followed by a lower , roughly constant density region , created by the fast main - sequence wind driving a shocked shell into the surrounding medium .",
    "this is the wind - blown bubble and reaches distances of a few tens of parsecs from the progenitor star ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ".    given the sizes of the respective regions and the measured radius of @xmath8 1pc for 43.31 + 59.2 , this would imply that this source would still be expanding into the remaining rsg wind .",
    "however the density gradient would produce a variable flux density , which is not observed .",
    "@xcite showed the flux density of 43.31 + 59.2 and 23 other snr to be stable over a 10 year period .",
    "the majority of these models assume an interstellar environment more typical of the galaxy than for a starburst such as m82 and it is therefore possible that the increased pressures found in m82 will have a stronger effect on the development of any wind - blown bubble surrounding the progenitor star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". the most likely outcome of which would be a reduced propagation of the various stages of mass - loss into any surrounding region and the ism . hence it is possible that for the case of 43.31 + 59.2 , the expanding remnant has already entered the lower - density environment of a wind - blown bubble , from which it is yet to emerge .",
    "the interstellar medium within m82 is clearly very complex and whilst this possibility may be argued for a number of other snr , it may well be a scenario that will not fit all .",
    "for example , 44.01 + 59.6 is comparable in size to 43.31 + 59.2 , though has a measured expansion velocity significantly lower , at @xmath02700@xcite , suggesting it s experiencing a higher density environment .",
    "a similar point can be made for 41.95 + 57.5 , if it is assumed that it does in fact represent a comparable snr scenario .",
    "conversely , sources such as 43.18 + 58.2 have been shown to be expanding at @xmath010500 .",
    "this is close to that of the newly discovered radio supernova sn2008iz , which has an average expansion over the first year of @xmath011000(assuming a distance to m82 of 3.6mpc ) @xcite .",
    "this implies 43.18 + 58.2 may still be in free - expansion at a size of @xmath02pc , even though its spectra shows a low - frequency turnover , suggesting it could be situated within or behind the dense ionised gas .",
    "the relatively young snr in m82 , such as 43.31 + 59.2 , are believed to have ages measured in decades , situating them between the young radio supernovae such as sn1979c , and the more evolved snr within our own galaxy ( e.g. cass a ) which are a few hundred years old .",
    "hence , detailed studies of the snr in m82 are vital to our understanding of the evolution of snr in general and in particular , to their early stages of development .",
    "the latest global vlbi observations of m82 presented here , have been used to monitor the expansion of the young snr 43.31 + 59.2 over a 19 year timeline and show the detailed structure of the sources 44.01 + 59.6 and 45.17 + 61.2 and 41.95 + 57.5 .    1 .",
    "the expansion velocity of the snr 43.31 + 59.2 , has been measured between 2001 and 2005 is 7600@xmath11800 .",
    "this confirms the high expansion velocity of this snr measured using previous epochs by @xcite 2 .",
    "size measurements at each epoch , have been used to study the possible deceleration of 43.31 + 59.2 . including the 1972 observation of @xcite , a lower limit to the deceleration parameter of 0.53@xmath10.06",
    "can be fitted to these measurements .",
    "the snr 44.01 + 59.6 has been imaged at each of the global vlbi epochs at 15mas resolution .",
    "the latest epoch shows a very similar structure to that originally observed by @xcite in 1997 .",
    "the structure of the source 45.17 + 61.2 has been revealed using the global vlbi 2005 observations confirming its elongated structure .    in addition",
    "the first combined 1.7ghz global vlbi and merlin observations of m82 have provided detailed images of the individual sources within m82 at this frequency .",
    "this has shown many of the snr to have clear shell or partial shell structures .    1 .",
    "a total of 32 snr have been detected in these observations with sizes ranging from 0.4 to 4.0pc , with a mean diameter of 2.1pc as well as two of the known regions .",
    "a possible previously unknown snr ( 45.88 + 69.7 ) has been detected , with a potential ring - like structure and diameter @xmath05pc .",
    "the supernova rate has been estimated from these combined observations using several methods which result in measurements of @xmath35 .",
    "use of these supernova rates to calculate the sfr for m82 gives values of sfr@xmath36@xmath37@xmath17 in agreement with measurements from other wavelengths .",
