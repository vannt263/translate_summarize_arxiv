    "as already noticed by bubenik and scott in @xcite , the definition of homological critical value given by cohen - steiner , edelsbrunner and harer in @xcite is problematic . to provide some justification for their own version of the definition , bubenik and scott (",
    "* footnote of definition 4.3 ) present a counterexample to the critical value lemma of @xcite under the original definition of @xcite .",
    "their counterexample , however , is a discontinuous function .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the definition is problematic also in the continuous ( or even smooth ) setting .",
    "we first show that under the definition of homological critical value in @xcite , the critical value lemma of @xcite in fact fails : in the second section , we present some simple counterexamples with increasingly nice properties .",
    "next , we show that there is a compact smooth manifold for which the critical value lemma fails .",
    "this requires some proving , thus we have devoted the whole third section to this example . in the fourth section we present a version of the critical value lemma that holds even under the problematic definition .",
    "we need to carefully distinguish between two definitions of homological critical value .",
    "this requires us to establish some new terminology .",
    "we first describe the currently accepted terminology , and then suggest the changes in terminology we believe are necessary .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors define homological critical value as follows :    let @xmath0 be a topological space and @xmath1 a real function on @xmath0 .",
    "a _ homological critical value _ of @xmath1 is a real number @xmath2 for which there exists an integer @xmath3 such that for all sufficiently small @xmath4 the map @xmath5)\\to h_k(f^{-1}(-\\infty , a+\\epsilon])$ ] induced by inclusion is not an isomorphism .",
    "here @xmath6 denotes the @xmath3-th singular homology ( possibly with coefficients in a field , as is usually assumed in the context of persistence ) .",
    "the main purpose of this definition is to establish the critical value lemma , which says the following :    suppose the function @xmath7 has no homological critical values on the closed interval @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "then the inclusion @xmath9\\hookrightarrow f^{-1}(-\\infty , y]$ ] induces isomorphisms on all homology groups .    as mentioned , under the above definition , the critical value lemma is in fact false .",
    "this problem is solved easily by replacing the above definition with the following one , suggested by bubenik and scott ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote of definition 4.3 ) , which we state in a slightly less general form as follows :    let @xmath0 be a topological space and @xmath1 a real function on @xmath0 .",
    "a real number @xmath2 is a _",
    "homological regular value _ of the function @xmath1 if there exists an @xmath4 such that for each pair of real numbers @xmath10 on the interval @xmath11 , the inclusion @xmath9\\hookrightarrow f^{-1}(-\\infty , y]$ ] induces isomorphisms on all homological groups .",
    "a real number @xmath2 that is not a homological regular value of @xmath1 is called a _ homological critical value _ of @xmath1 .    for this definition , the critical value lemma does indeed hold , as bubenik and scott show ( in a more general form ) in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.4 ) .",
    "this leaves us with two non - equivalent definitions of homological critical value . to distinguish between the two , we adopt the following    homological critical values from the first ( problematic ) definition @xcite",
    "will be called _ symmetric homological critical values _ of @xmath1 .",
    "homological critical values from the second definition will simply be called _ homological critical values _ , i.e. we accept the second definition as the preferred one . a real number that is not a symmetric homological critical value of @xmath1",
    "will be called a _",
    "symmetric homological regular value_.",
    "we will now show that under the symmetric definition of homological critical value , the critical value lemma fails .",
    "the following counterexample is inspired by the discontinuous counterexample given by bubenik and scott in @xcite .",
    "define a topological space @xmath12 ( equipped with the subspace topology ) as follows : @xmath13\\cup(0,1)\\times(0,1]\\cup\\{1\\}\\times[0,1]\\ ] ]    ( throughout this paper , we adopt the convention that @xmath14 binds more strongly than @xmath15 . ) define a function @xmath7 on this space by the formula @xmath16 , i.e. the height function .",
    "the various sublevel sets @xmath17 $ ] look as follows .",
    "( note that @xmath0 looks exactly like the sublevel set pictured for @xmath18 , but with a square instead of rectangle . )",
    "we claim that @xmath7 has no symmetric homological critical values in the interval @xmath19 . to see this , first notice that @xmath17 $ ] is contractible for all @xmath20\\setminus\\{0\\}$ ] .",
    "this implies that every @xmath21 has a neighborhood @xmath22 such that for @xmath23 the induced homomorphisms on the @xmath3-th homology groups are trivial for all @xmath24 .",
    "since the corresponding homology groups are also trivial , they are isomorphisms . furthermore , the induced homomorphisms on zeroth homology groups are isomorphisms as well , because the underlying spaces are path - connected .",
    "for @xmath25 the situation is similar : taking any @xmath26 , the spaces @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] are contractible and thus the inclusion @xmath27\\hookrightarrow f^{-1}(-\\infty,\\epsilon]$ ] induces isomorphisms on all homology groups .",
    "this shows that there are indeed no symmetric homological critical values in @xmath19 .",
    "therefore there are no symmetric homological critical values in @xmath29 $ ] either . despite this",
    ", @xmath30 $ ] has one path component , while @xmath31 $ ] has two , implying that their zeroth homology groups can not be isomorphic .",
    "this contradicts the critical value lemma as presented in @xcite .",
    "note that we can make the critical value lemma fail on higher homology groups just as easily .",
    "for example , it fails ( by an analogous argument ) on @xmath32 if we define @xmath33 ( using , of course , the natural identification of @xmath34 with @xmath35 ) by @xmath36\\cup s^1\\times[0,1]\\cup d^2\\times(0,1]\\ ] ] where @xmath37 denote the unit circle and the closed unit disk , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath7 for which the critical value lemma fails is again a height function , this time defined by @xmath38 .",
    "a natural question that arises after seeing the counterexample just presented is : can we make the underlying topological space compact ?",
    "the answer is : indeed , we can . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath39\\right\\}\\cup\\{0\\}\\times[-1,1]\\subseteq\\mathbb r^2\\ ] ] be the usual topologist s sine curve .",
    "now , for @xmath40 $ ] , define @xmath41\\times[-1,1]\\ ] ] and let @xmath42\\cup\\bigcup_{r\\in[0,1 ] } k_r\\times\\{r\\}\\subseteq\\mathbb r^3.\\ ] ] ( via the canonical identification @xmath43 . ) as in the previous example , let @xmath7 be the height function defined by @xmath38 .",
    "now , examine the sublevel set @xmath17 $ ] . for negative @xmath2 ,",
    "this is just the interval @xmath44 $ ] , which is clearly contractible . for positive @xmath2",
    ", we get @xmath45\\cup\\bigcup_{r\\in[0,a ] } k_r\\times\\{r\\}\\ ] ] which has an obvious deformation retraction to the `` top level '' @xmath46 , which is again contractible and thus , so is the sublevel set . for @xmath25 , on the other hand , we get @xmath45\\cup k\\times\\{0\\}\\ ] ] which again deformation retracts to the top level , but this time the top level is a topologist s sine curve , which has two path components . as in the previous example",
    ", all this ( combined with the fact that there are no symmetric homological critical values , which follows immediately from what we have just seen ) means that @xmath0 is a counterexample to the critical value lemma .",
    "( there are again many easy ways to modify this so that the critical value lemma fails for higher homology groups : for example , rotating the topologist s sine curve around its endpoint ( or end interval ) and doing an analogous construction makes the critical value lemma fail for @xmath32 . )",
    "the sublevel sets of @xmath1 are a bit hard to draw , so instead we provide some pictures of level sets ( which are precisely the horizontal slices of @xmath0 ) as seen from the top .",
    "the level sets for negative @xmath2 are singletons .",
    "note that the level sets increase ( in the sense of inclusion as subsets of the plane , i.e. if we forget the third coordinate ) as @xmath2 increases .",
    "@xmath0 consists of these level sets stacked on top of each other .",
    "( which gives us an easy way of visualizing it . )",
    "note that we could also have taken @xmath47 and the same construction would work , basically for the same reasons .",
    "( one of the key features of such @xmath48 is that it is a contractible set for @xmath49 ; for the proof of this , follow the same idea as for the contractibility of sublevel sets in the next example . )",
    "next , we present a topological manifold for which the critical value lemma fails under the symmetric definition .",
    "take the topologist s sine curve @xmath50 from the previous example and add a square to it : @xmath51\\times[-1,1]$ ] .",
    "now define the signed distance function ( see @xcite ) @xmath52 as follows @xmath53    the set @xmath54 looks as follows :    this is also the sublevel set for @xmath25 .",
    "the sublevel sets for @xmath55 are smaller squares inside @xmath56\\times[-1,1]$ ] and the sublevel sets for @xmath18 are thickened versions of @xmath54 .",
    "the function @xmath1 is clearly continuous .",
    "sublevel sets @xmath17 $ ] are contractible for negative and positive @xmath2 .",
    "( for the positive ones , we will prove this in a moment . ) for @xmath25 , the sublevel set is @xmath54 , which has two connected components . by once again the same argument as before",
    ", this means we have found another counterexample .",
    "if we want the function to be a height function , we instead examine the graph of @xmath1 , i.e. the set @xmath57 and the function @xmath58 given by @xmath59 .    note",
    "that @xmath60 is a homeomorphism from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , which shows that @xmath62 is a topological manifold .",
    "furthermore , this homeomorphism takes the sublevel sets of @xmath1 to sublevel sets of @xmath63 , which is why this remains a counterexample .",
    "now , the justification we promised . to prove that @xmath17 $ ] is contractible for @xmath18 , we need a lemma .",
    "[ kontraktibilnost ] let @xmath64 be contractible .",
    "let @xmath65 , where for each @xmath66 , @xmath67 is a non - empty ( but possibly degenerate ) interval .",
    "suppose there exists a continuous function @xmath68 such that the graph @xmath69 is a subset of @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath70 is contractible .",
    "since the `` vertical slices '' @xmath71 of @xmath70 are intervals , the formula @xmath72 defines a map @xmath73 .",
    "this map is a deformation retraction of @xmath70 to @xmath74 .",
    "the latter is homeomorphic to @xmath0 , and thus contractible .",
    "this lemma will also be useful to us in the next section .",
    "both times , we use it for the case where @xmath0 is an interval .",
    "the lemma tells us that to show that the sublevel sets for @xmath18 are contractible , we only need to show that their vertical slices are intervals and exhibit an appropriate continuous function @xmath75 . before doing this",
    ", we establish another lemma .",
    "[ intervali ] suppose @xmath76 are continuous functions , such that @xmath77 and @xmath0 is a connected topological space",
    ". then @xmath78\\ ] ] is an interval .",
    "clearly , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath81 are continuous functions and @xmath0 is connected , these are intervals .",
    "now let @xmath82 be arbitrary .",
    "then @xmath83\\subseteq j$ ] and @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this implies that @xmath86 thus , indeed , @xmath87 is an interval .",

    "first , we show that for any @xmath89 , the set @xmath90 is an interval .",
    "( possibly empty or degenerate . ) to see this , note that @xmath91 ( where by @xmath92 we denote the closed ball of radius @xmath93 centered at @xmath66 and @xmath94 is the corresponding open ball ) if and only if @xmath95 as an elementary calculation shows .",

    ", the intersection @xmath90 is non - empty .",
    "we can therefore define the following continuous function @xmath104\\to\\mathbb r$ ] : @xmath105\\\\ \\sin\\frac{\\pi}a;&x\\leq a. \\end{cases}\\ ] ] and the graph @xmath74 is a subset of @xmath106 .",
    "the proof is complete by lemma [ kontraktibilnost ] .",
    "we might further want to compactify our example to show that the critical value lemma may fail for compact topological manifolds , but as the next section shows an even stronger result , we omit this .",
    "in this section , we construct a compact smooth manifold embedded in @xmath107 which , together with its height function , provides us with yet another counterexample to the critical value lemma .",
    "first , we examine the function @xmath52 defined by @xmath108 this is a smooth function ( for the proof , see appendix ) .",
    "it is of interest to us because of its sublevel sets : @xmath31 $ ] is a connected set with three path components .",
    "( it is just a slightly modified version of the topologist s sine curve . ) in fact , the level sets of @xmath1 can all be expressed explicitly .",
    "we leave this as an easy exercise for the reader and only state the results here :    * for @xmath18 we have @xmath109 * for @xmath25 @xmath110 * and for @xmath55 the level set is empty .    we should mention that here and throughout this paper , we consider an equation of the form @xmath111 to be false for points @xmath66 where @xmath112 is undefined . in the present case ,",
    "this only affects the point @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is undefined ( and is the reason for treating the case @xmath115 separately ) .",
    "this also gives us the sublevel sets :    * for @xmath18 we have @xmath116 which might be written more compactly as @xmath117 * for @xmath25 @xmath118 * and for @xmath55 the sublevel set is empty .",
    "this is very close to what we are looking for : for @xmath18 the sublevel sets are contractible and the sublevel set for @xmath25 is not contractible .",
    "the only things missing are contractible sublevel sets for @xmath55 and compactness of sublevel sets .",
    "( which will later help us make our example compact . ) we need to modify @xmath1 a bit .",
    "the following function @xmath119 is helpful in doing this : @xmath120 it is a standard result that this is a smooth function ( see for example @xcite ; for the basic idea also see appendix , where we prove that @xmath121 is smooth ) .",
    "we now modify @xmath1 as follows : define @xmath122 by @xmath123 here , the first correction term gives us the contractible sublevel sets for @xmath55 we wanted ( without destroying nice properties we already have ) and the second correction term ( which conveniently grows to infinity as @xmath124 ) takes us one step closer to compactness , since the sublevel sets now become bounded in one direction .",
    "we will show that this is so in a moment .",
    "when we are done showing this , we will introduce a third ( and last ) correction term , which will cause the sublevel sets to become bounded in the other direction .",
    "( and thus compact by heine - borel , since the sublevel sets of a continuous function are closed . )",
    "all of what we just said follows from the fact that the sublevel sets can again be written explicitly .",
    "the calculation is basically the same as for @xmath1 , so we again leave it to the reader .",
    "the results are :    * for @xmath125 we have @xmath126 * and for @xmath25 @xmath127    the results are a bit more complicated than for @xmath1 , so we have to say a few words about them . to understand what these equations tell us , we have to understand where the appropriate expressions are defined .",
    "in particular , the square root is only defined for non - negative arguments .",
    "( note also that the problem with @xmath113 we mentioned when studying the sublevel sets of @xmath1 remains the same . )",
    "this tells us that the equations above only make sense for @xmath128    first , we consider the case @xmath129 . in this case , the inequality clearly holds for @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "( as @xmath131 is zero there . ) for @xmath132 $ ] the inequality is equivalent to @xmath133 .",
    "this inequality is satisfied if and only if @xmath134 $ ] , where @xmath135 .",
    "note that the function @xmath136 is strictly increasing and @xmath137 . to sum up : the level sets for @xmath18 are defined ( by the above equations ) for @xmath134\\setminus\\{0\\}$ ] and the level set for @xmath115 is defined ( by the above equations ) for @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "the remaining case is @xmath55 . in this case",
    ", the inequality is clearly false for @xmath138 .",
    "for @xmath139 it is equivalent to @xmath140 .",
    "as it turns out ( an easy exercise which we leave to the reader ) , for @xmath141 , this inequality is equivalent to @xmath142 $ ] , where @xmath143 , which is defined if and only if @xmath144 .    for the sake of completeness , we note that for @xmath145 , the inequality implies @xmath146 which is equivalent to @xmath147 .",
    "this clearly has no solutions in @xmath148 .",
    "this means that for @xmath145 , the level ( and sublevel ) sets are empty .",
    "the sublevel sets of @xmath81 are therefore given by :    * if @xmath129 @xmath149 * if @xmath150 @xmath151 * empty for @xmath145",
    ".    in other words , the sublevel sets are the areas bounded by the corresponding level sets .",
    "the main point of all this is of course that the sublevel sets retain all the properties we need ( namely , they are contractible for all @xmath152 , except for @xmath25 ) .",
    "a picture is worth a thousand words , so we present some mathematica plots of the sublevel sets of @xmath81 .    * for @xmath153 : +    * for @xmath154 : +    * for @xmath25 ; this one looks like a curve . that s a bit misleading though , since it actually contains a tiny bulge ( a topological disk ) in the area @xmath155",
    "this disk is invisible to the naked eye , though .",
    "( actually , the previous two examples also contain invisible bulges , but in that case , these do nt affect the topology .",
    "so , even though a picture is worth a thousand words , some of those words might be lies . )",
    "the bulges mentioned are invisible because @xmath156 has very small values and thus causes only a tiny perturbation on the appropriate sublevel set of @xmath1 ( which is indeed a curve for @xmath139 ) : +    * for @xmath55 ; this one should be completely invisible to the naked eye .",
    "the following plot is a sublevel set for @xmath55 where instead of the correction term @xmath156 we subtracted @xmath157 .",
    "this is nt a sublevel set of @xmath81 , but we hope it should convey to the reader the same general idea about how the correction term works : +     now we introduce the final correction term .",
    "we define the function @xmath158 by the formula @xmath159 because of this last term , the function now `` diverges to infinity as @xmath160 approaches infinity '' .",
    "this means that the sublevel sets are now bounded and thus compact by heine - borel .",
    "we only need to show now that they retain all the nice properties they had before .",
    "this time , we wo nt be able to describe all the sublevel sets explicitly .",
    "note , however , that the sublevel ( and level ) sets for @xmath55 remain unchanged , as the new correction term has support in @xmath161 , which these sublevel sets do nt intersect .",

    ", we again provide some pictures .",
    "the parameters are the same as for @xmath81 , so that the reader may compare the differences .",
    "( note that we left out the sublevel sets for non - positive values of @xmath2 , since these would tell us nothing new . )    * for @xmath153 : +    * for @xmath154 : +     we establish contractibility of @xmath168 $ ] in two propositions .",
    "suppose @xmath18 .",
    "then the vertical slices @xmath170 $ ] are of the form @xmath71 , where @xmath67 is a ( possibly empty or degenerate ) interval .",

    "now , note that @xmath191 holds by the properties of @xmath177 we described above .",

    "to provide some contrast to all the counterexamples above , we devote this section to proving a positive result about symmetric homological critical values . as",

    "our result is the following .",

    "note that this result holds for spaces that may be immensely more pathological than the spaces the usual critical value lemma is used to handle . in particular , the result holds for the counterexamples we have presented .",
    "we thus expect it to be useful in studying such pathological spaces .",
    "we prove our result in four steps . throughout the rest of this section ,",
    "let @xmath3 be a fixed integer",

    "for the first part of the claim , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.33 ) .",
    "if the sets @xmath295 are open , they form an open cover for @xmath0 ( and its compact subsets ) . thus in that case",
    "each compact set is contained in some @xmath295 .    for the second part of the claim we notice that for every @xmath268 there is an isomorphism @xmath299 , either induced by inclusion or an inverse of such .",
    "the group @xmath297 together with these isomorphisms satisfies the universal property of the direct limit and is thus canonically isomorphic to it .",
    "therefore there is a unique map @xmath298 that makes the appropriate diagram commute and by the first part of the claim it is an isomorphism .",
    "since the map @xmath298 induced by inclusion makes the mentioned diagram commute , it must be the same map and thus also an isomorphism .",
    "we proceed to the next step .",
    "suppose an interval @xmath242 contains no symmetric homological critical values of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath260 .",

    "note also that the increasing union @xmath306 ( where we additionally define @xmath307 , to avoid having to write the space @xmath308 separately ) has the required property that every compact set @xmath309 is contained in some @xmath310 .",
    "( this an easy consequence of the fact that the sets @xmath311 form an open cover of @xmath312 . )",

    "the last step , of course , is the lemma itself :    suppose an interval @xmath242 contains no symmetric homological critical values of @xmath1 .",

    "this means that @xmath321 is an isomorphism .",
    "the proof is complete .",

    "@xmath330 $ ] also induces isomorphisms .",

    "we have shown that the definition of homological critical value as stated in @xcite is problematic .",
    "we have presented several counterexamples to the critical value lemma under that definition .",
    "nevertheless , we have also seen that a positive result remains valid for open sublevel sets .",
    "this suggests that the open sublevel sets have a very nice behaviour when it comes to homology . noting that every symmetric homological critical value is a homological critical value , but not vice versa , this positive result might open ( pun not intended ) up new possibilities of studying somewhat more pathological examples of topological spaces .",
    "namely , a function may possess many homological critical values ( making it impossible to apply the critical value lemma ) , but it may happen that none of these homological critical values are symmetric .",
    "in such a case , we may still apply the symmetric version of the critical value lemma to yield something possibly useful .    as a particular example , note that the symmetric critical value lemma holds for each of the counterexamples we have presented , even though the original critical value lemma can not be used directly .",
