    "the defining prediction of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of cosmological structure formation is that dark matter haloes contain an abundance of lower mass substructure haloes ( hereafter subhalos ; e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* klypin et al . 1999 ,",
    "moore et al . 1999 ) ) .",
    "alternatives to the cdm model , such as warm dark matter ( wdm ) , suppress the abundance of low - mass dark matter halos , and consequently the abundance of subhalos , but distinguishing between these alternatives and cdm in this way in a robust fashion is challenging ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* power 2013 ) ) .",
    "this is because the mass scale at which differences between plausible dark matter models is most likely to be evident  at or below the scale of the satellites of the milky way ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schneider et al . 2014 ) )  is also the mass scale at or below which galaxy formation is inefficient and apparently stochastic ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2011 ) ) .",
    "however , deep observations of the milky way and external galaxies reveal that they are embedded in a diffuse , extended stellar component ( esc ) of shells , streams , and halos ( e.g. ) , which are the relics of the tidal disruption of satellite galaxies ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* bullock & johnston 2005 , cooper et al . 2010 ) ) .",
    "because these satellites are embedded within low - mass dark matter subhalos , it is plausible that the underlying dark matter model could leave an imprint on the structure of the esc  models in which the abundance of low - mass subhalos , and consequently satellite galaxies , is suppressed could result in less massive , less luminous , and more centrally concentrated escs compared to cdm .",
    "this is because subhalos follow similar orbits in cdm and wdm models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( e.g. knebe et al . 2008 ) ) , and because low - mass subhalos and satellites follow preferentially radial orbits and require many pericentric passages before their orbits decay , their tidally stripped stars can be spread over large galacto - centric distances .",
    "the physics that governs galaxy formation should not depend on the underlying dark matter model , and so differences in esc properties should reflect differences in satellite abundance , which depends on the subhalo abundance .",
    "these differences could be accessible to current ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. van dokkum et al . 2014 ) ) and future surveys ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. lsst science collaboration 2009 ) ) that target the diffuse , low surface brightness environs of galaxies , and so represents a potentially robust observational test of dark matter .",
    "we have tested the feasibility of this idea in @xcite using a set of cosmological zoom galaxy formation simulations of 6 milky way mass galaxies ( mw01 to mw06 ) forming in a cdm model , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath3=0 .",
    "these were run with a version of the gadget @xmath4-body / sph code of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* springel ( 2005 ) ) that includes prescriptions for cooling , star formation , and supernova feedback .    in the case of one of the galaxies , mw02 , we ran 3 additional versions , assuming wdm models with particle masses of @xmath5=0.5 , 1 , and 2 kev/@xmath6 ; this was done by modifying the initial cdm power spectrum following the approach of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bode et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) .",
    "although models with @xmath7 are not favoured by current observational limits , we wanted to establish whether or not dark matter models that alter the abundance of substructure can leave an imprint on observable properties of galaxies .",
    "these simulations reveal that it is in the spatial structure of the esc that the imprint of the underlying dark matter model is most readily apparent . in the left hand panel of figure  [ fig : density_profile_z0 ] , we show spherically averaged mass density profiles at @xmath3=0 for stars , gas , and dark matter for the the cdm and wdm @xmath5=2 , 1 , and 0.5 kev/@xmath6 kev versions of mw02 ( dotted - dashed , dotted , dashed , solid curves ) , while in the right hand panel we show only stellar profiles for the cdm versions of the 6 galaxies , mw01 to mw06 .",
    "this figure confirms our expectation that properties of the esc varies with the underlying dark matter model  outside of the region within which the galaxy disc reside , between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we find that the spherically averaged stellar density is approximately an order of magnitude smaller in the wdm @xmath5=1 and 0.5 kev@xmath10 runs than in the cdm and wdm 2 kev@xmath10 runs . this difference is imprinted early in the history of the galaxy at least back to @xmath11  and persists to @xmath3=0 .",
    "* here we show spherically averaged mass density profiles of different components of the simulated galaxies . on the _ left _",
    "we compare stars , dark matter , and gas inthe fiducial cdm run ( dotted - dashed curves ) and wdm @xmath5=2 , 1 , and 0.5 @xmath12 profiles ( dotted , dashed , and solid curves ) . on the _ right _ we compare only stellar profiles for the 6 galaxies that form in the cdm model , all selected to form in low - density regions and all with @xmath13 at @xmath3=0.,title=\"fig : \" ] = 0 . * here we show spherically averaged mass density profiles of different components of the simulated galaxies . on the _ left _",

    "this variation , which reflect differences in assembly history , highlights the difficulty of using the esc as a test of dark matter  but suggests that the esc can be used to extend the concept of galactic archaeology to systems beyond the milky way and andromeda , as is being done in nearby galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "combining metallicity , kinematics , and spatial structure , it should be possible to trace the assembly history of galaxies .",
    "the focus of this work has been on the utility of the unresolved esc  the spatial distribution and kinematics of stellar material in galaxy outskirts that will be accessible to deep imaging surveys , possibly by stacking large numbers of galaxies by central galaxy stellar mass or halo mass bins  as a testbed for dark matter , to carry out a statistical detection .",
    "our results suggest that this will be challenging .",
    "however , the resolved esc might also be used , by combining spatial , kinematic and metallicity substructure information to test dark matter ; this will require the kind of statistical sample of local volume galaxies that will be accessible with lsst .",
    "even if this remains a challenging test of dark matter , there is good reason to expect that we can use properties of the esc to explore the mass assembly histories of galaxies , tracing merger and accretion events using material in the outer halo , and placing limits of the growth of galaxies in the context of their larger scale environment .",
