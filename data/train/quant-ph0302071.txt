    "the casimir force @xcite has recently been measured with a good experimental precision which allows for an accurate comparison between measured values and theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "this comparison plays an important role in the searches of new weak forces with nanometric to millimetric ranges motivated by theoretical unification models @xcite .",
    "these forces would appear as experiment / theory differences in precise measurements of the casimir force .",
    "as far as an accurate theory - experiment comparison is aimed at , the accuracy of theory is as crucial as the precision of experiments .",
    "if the target is a given accuracy , say at the @xmath0 level , the theoretical prediction has to be mastered at this level as well as the experimental measurement .",
    "clearly , this requires to take into account the real conditions of the experiments which differ from the ideal situation often assumed in the theory of the casimir effect .",
    "casimir initially studied the case of a pair of perfectly smooth , flat and parallel plates in the limit of zero temperature and perfect reflection .",
    "he found a force which depends only on geometrical properties , the distance @xmath1 between the plates and their area @xmath2 supposed to be much larger than @xmath3 , and two fundamental constants , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this remarkable fact is related to the assumption of perfect reflection while the most precise experiments @xcite are performed with metallic mirrors which are nearly perfect reflectors only at frequencies smaller than a characteristic plasma frequency @xmath6 so that the force is affected by imperfect reflection at distances smaller than or of the order of the plasma wavelength @xmath7 .",
    "the same experiments are performed at room temperature , which implies that the force also depends on the scattering of blackbody radiation , in a geometry different from the ideal geometry considered by casimir : the force is measured between a plane and a spherical reflectors which show some surface roughness .    the aim of the present letter is to raise questions about the validity of the current evaluation of the effect of surface roughness . for the sake of comparison with forthcoming discussions , we first recall the principles of this evaluation which is based on the proximity force approximation @xcite , denoted pfa hereafter .",
    "we then introduce an improved method where the sensitivity to roughness depends on the wavevector associated with surface deformations .",
    "we get information on this sensitivity by considering metallic plates in the two limits of long or short distances , where the roughness sensitivity can be deduced from earlier calculations devoted respectively to perfect reflectors @xcite and to mirrors described by the surface plasmon approach @xcite . in the present letter ,",
    "we focus our attention on questions of interest for the comparison of theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of the casimir force in the plane - sphere geometry .",
    "we disregard the temperature effect which is significant at large distances whereas roughness corrections are more important at the smallest distances explored in the experiments .",
    "we give only the main results of our calculations and refer the reader interested by more detailed developments to forthcoming publications .",
    "when using the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) , the force @xmath8 in the plane - sphere geometry is obtained as the sum of the contributions corresponding to an effective inter - plate distance @xmath9 which varies from the distance of closest approach @xmath1 to infinity .",
    "as the area element @xmath10 corresponding to an interval @xmath11 is proportional to this interval and to the radius @xmath12 of the sphere , @xmath8 is given by geometric arguments and by the casimir energy @xmath13 calculated between two planes @xmath14 we emphasize that the pfa amounts to the addition of contributions corresponding to different distances @xmath9 , assuming these contributions to be independent . but the casimir force is not additive , so that the pfa can not be exact , although it is often improperly called a theorem .",
    "the results available for the plane - sphere geometry @xcite show that the pfa leads to correct results when the radius @xmath12 of the sphere is much larger than the distance @xmath1 of closest approach .",
    "the roughness correction is also often evaluated by using the pfa .",
    "we suppose that the two mirrors @xmath15 have roughness profile functions @xmath16 where @xmath17 collects the two transverse coordinates @xmath18 orthogonal to the direction @xmath9 of the cavity . both deformations @xmath19 and @xmath20 are counted as positive when they correspond to length increases above the mean . using calligraphic letters for the energy between rough plates and normal letters for the energy between smooth plates , we obtain with the pfa @xmath21 the symbol @xmath22 denotes an average over the transverse coordinates . we have assumed that the profiles have a null average value @xmath23 and restricted the evaluation at the second order in the deformations .",
    "hence , the roughness correction depends on the second order derivative @xmath24 of the energy and on the variance of the length deformation @xmath25 .",
    "this expression is equivalent to the procedure used for analyzing the effect of roughness in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "it can be simplified one step further when the area @xmath2 of the plates contains a large number of correlation areas .",
    "we denote @xmath26 the correlation length of the roughness profiles and suppose @xmath27 .",
    "we also suppose that the profiles of the two plates have no special relation to each other so that the integration over the surface is equivalent to a statistical averaging over a number of different realisations of these profiles .",
    "it follows that the cross correlation @xmath28 between the two profiles can be ignored , which leads to the expression @xmath29 note that the last simplification would not be applicable to the case of corrugated plates @xcite which is not considered in the present letter .",
    "the preceding equation can be translated into expressions of the casimir forces between rough plates , denoted with similar conventions . in the plane - plane geometry , the force @xmath30 between rough plates",
    "would be obtained by differentiating ( [ epppfa ] ) with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "here we consider the plane - sphere geometry with the radius of the sphere large enough so that the pfa ( [ fpssmooth ] ) is valid in the absence of roughness . in the presence of roughness",
    ", we define @xmath12 as the radius of the sphere realizing the best fit of the real surface of the curved mirror .",
    "we then define the roughness profile as the deviation of the real surface from the best - fit sphere and suppose the statistical properties of this profile to be uncorrelated with the mean spherical geometry .",
    "we also assume that the number of correlation areas @xmath31 contributing significantly to the whole force is very large , so that the integration over the surface is still equivalent to a statistical averaging over a number of different realisations of these profiles .",
    "this assumption is consistent when the condition @xmath32 holds ( see a similar discussion in @xcite ) and it allows us to ignore the cross correlation between the profiles of the two mirrors .",
    "when these conditions are met , the force @xmath33 is given by an expression which generalizes ( [ fpssmooth ] ) to the case of rough plates @xmath34",
    "clearly , the pfa can only be valid for long - wavelength deformations .",
    "in particular , it gives a correct evaluation of the effect of curvature of the spherical mirror when @xmath35 .",
    "as far as roughness is concerned , the pfa holds for small enough values of the transverse wavevector @xmath36 but not in the general case of an arbitrary wavevector .    in order to deal quantitatively with this problem",
    ", we introduce the spectral densities @xmath37 which describe the correlation properties of the profiles @xmath38 @xmath39    = \\int \\mathrm{d}^{2}\\mathbf{r } \\",

    ", the functions @xmath41 depend on the transverse wavevector @xmath43 and thus measure the spectral sensitivity to roughness of the casimir effect .",
    "as previously , we disregard the crossed correlation terms @xmath37 with @xmath44 which tend to be averaged to zero in the integration over the surface . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we also suppose that the two mirrors are made with the same metal so that the roughness sensitivity is described by a single function @xmath45   ~\\sigma\\left [   \\mathbf{k}\\right ]   \\quad,\\quad\\sigma\\left [ \\mathbf{k}\\right ]   = \\sigma_{11}\\left [   \\mathbf{k}\\right ]   + \\sigma_{22}\\left [ \\mathbf{k}\\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ &   g\\left [   \\mathbf{k}\\right ]   = g_{11}\\left [   \\mathbf{k}\\right ] = g_{22}\\left [   \\mathbf{k}\\right ]   = \\frac{e_{\\mathrm{pp}}^{\\prime\\prime}\\left ( l\\right )   } { 2}\\rho\\left [   \\mathbf{k}\\right ]   \\label{epp}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have introduced a reduced sensitivity @xmath46 which goes to unity in the pfa sector .",
    "due to the cylindrical symmetry with respect to rotations in the transverse plane , @xmath47 and @xmath46 are functions of @xmath48 only .",
    "the derivation of equation ( [ fpsexp ] ) presented above remains valid outside the pfa sector .",
    "hence , the roughness correction to the casimir force in the plane - sphere geometry is read @xmath49 \\ \\sigma\\left [   \\mathbf{k}\\right ]   \\label{fps}%\\ ] ] incidentally , we notice that the casimir force @xmath30 in the plane - plane geometry could be obtained by differentiating @xmath50 with respect to @xmath1 , taking into account that @xmath46 depends on the distance @xmath1 . for the sake of illustrating the significance of these results",
    ", we can consider the example of a gaussian roughness spectrum @xmath51=a^{2}\\pi\\ell_{c}^{2}\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{\\mathbf{k}^{2}\\ell_{c}^{2}}{4}\\right )    \\label{gaussian}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 measures the roughness amplitude and @xmath26 the roughness correlation length .",
    "this example allows one to specify the definition of the correlation length @xmath26 but it can not be used as a general description of roughness profiles . in order to discuss the experimental situations ,",
    "the roughness spectra must be deduced from images of the real plates .",
    "when the inter - plate distance @xmath1 is much larger than the plasma length @xmath53 , metallic mirrors behave as perfect reflectors .",
    "it follows that the roughness sensitivity can be obtained as a by - product of recent computations by emig _",
