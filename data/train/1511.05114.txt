    "sufficiently large spatially extended predator - prey systems with efficient predation are similarly characterized by large initial erratic population oscillations .",
    "ultimately , a quasi - stationary state ( in the limit of large particle numbers ) is reached , where both population densities remain non - zero @xcite@xcite .",
    "the exceedingly long transients towards this asymptotic predator - prey coexistence state are characterized by strong spatio - temporal correlations associated with the spontaneous formation of spreading activity fronts , depicted in fig .",

    "we impose locally limited carrying capacities for each species through implementing lattice site occupation restrictions : the number of particles per lattice site can only be either @xmath1 or @xmath2 ; i.e. , each lattice site can either be empty , occupied by a ` predator ' @xmath3 , or occupied by a ` prey ' @xmath4 particle .",

    "the predator density autocorrelation function @xmath133 is obtained in a straightforward manner by monitoring the occupations of the lattice sites with @xmath3 particles following the previously discussed predation probability quench scenario to its critical value @xmath86 after the system had first reached a quasi - stationary state .",
    "if time translation invariance applies , the ensuing curves of @xmath133 plotted against @xmath134 should overlap for different values of the waiting time @xmath130 .",
    "indeed , this is clearly seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) for the expected exponentially fast relaxation of the predator density autocorrelation function following a sudden quench from @xmath72 to @xmath145 , whence the system remains within the two - species coexistence phase . in stark contrast , as becomes apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , time translation invariance is manifestly broken at the critical point .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , we plot our data for the critical density autocorrelations , now averaged over @xmath146 simulation runs , in the form of @xmath147 versus the time ratio @xmath148 , for a set of waiting times @xmath149 mcs @xmath150 mcs , in order to test for the simple aging dynamical scaling scenario .",
    "the aging exponent @xmath138 is determined by attempting to collapse the data for the three large waiting times @xmath151  mcs onto a single master curve . with the choice @xmath152",
    ", the predator density autocorrelation function displays simple aging scaling for @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath93 mcs .",
    "however , for small @xmath155  mcs , the curves can not be properly rescaled and collapsed . depending on how many data points in the @xmath148 plot",
    "are used , one obtains slightly different values for @xmath138 ; their standard deviation gives our estimated errors . within these error bars ,",
    "the directed percolation scaling relation @xmath156 is just marginally fulfilled .",
    "we also remark that since our estimate for the location of the critical point @xmath86 is inevitably measured only with limited accuracy , and we can not meaningfully extend our finite - system simulation runs for arbitrarily long time periods , we also do not observe aging scaling anymore for @xmath157 mcs ; to extend the aging analysis to larger waiting times would require both a more accurate measurement of @xmath86 and larger simulation domains .",
    "finally , the exponent ratio @xmath158 may be estimated from the slope of the master curve in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) resulting from the data collapse at large waiting times ; see also the inset that shows the associated effective exponent .",
    "we find @xmath159 , which within the estimated error bars is in fair agreement with the value @xmath160 measured for the contact process in @xmath161 dimensions @xcite , and in accord with the scaling relation . to ascertain that the critical aging exponents do not depend on the initial configurations",
    ", we have repeated the above procedures for monte carlo simulations initiated with randomly distributed particles at the critical predation probability @xmath86 rather than starting with the spatially correlated initial configurations prepared in quasi - steady states .",
    "we have confirmed that we thereby obtain identical values for @xmath138 and @xmath158 , as listed in the first column of table  [ table ] . within our error",
    "bars these are in accord with the two - dimensional values obtained for the contact process @xcite and in experiments on turbulent liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig6](b ) demonstrates that convincing critical aging scaling collapse is achieved for @xmath162 , or @xmath163 mcs even for the longest waiting time @xmath164 mcs under consideration here .",
    "note that aging scaling thus appears by about a factor of @xmath165 earlier in the system s temporal evolution than the critical power laws describing the quasi - stationary predator density decay and the divergence of the characteristic relaxation time .",
    "just as critical slowing - down , the emergence of physical aging and certainly the associated dynamical scaling is an unambiguous indicator of the ecosystem s proximity to population extinction .",
    "critical aging scaling hence provides a complementary warning signal for impending collapse , yet becomes manifestly visible markedly earlier in the system s time evolution .",
    "we end our discussion of non - equilibrium relaxation processes in spatially extended stochastic lotka ",
    "volterra models by briefly addressing the sole remaining quench scenario , which takes the system from the active two - species coexistence state to the absorbing phase wherein the predator population goes extinct .",
    "outside the critical parameter region , the characteristic relaxation time @xmath110 is finite ; i.e. , the mean predator density will decay to zero exponentially fast , as local predator clusters become increasingly dilute , while the prey gradually fill the entire system . in the absorbing state ,",
    "population density fluctuations eventually cease , whence no interesting dynamical features remain .",
    "to conclude , we have investigated non - equilibrium relaxation features in a stochastic lotka  volterra model on a two - dimensional lattice via detailed monte carlo simulations .",
    "if the prey carrying capacity is limited , i.e. , in the presence of site restrictions ( and for sufficiently large system size ) , there appears a predator extinction threshold that separates an inactive phase wherein the prey proliferate and the predators die out , from an active phase where both species coexist and compete . in a first set of numerical experiments , we observe the system s relaxation either from a random initial configuration or between two quasi - stationary states within the active coexistence phase via suddenly changing the predation rate .",
    "as expected , we find that the initial state generically only influences the subsequent oscillatory dynamics for the duration of about one characteristic relaxation time , implying that the system exponentially quickly loses any memory of the initial configuration .    our main focus has thus been the analysis of critical quenches and the ensuing dynamical scaling behavior .",
    "following a quench of the predation rate to its critical value for the predator species extinction threshold , we have measured the dynamic scaling exponents for the diverging relaxation time and the algebraic decay of the predator density . within our systematic and statistical errors , we obtained the expected values for the directed percolation universality class that generically characterizes active - to - absorbing phase transitions .",
    "in addition , we have studied the critical aging properties of this system : reflecting critical slowing - down , the characteristic relaxation time diverges at the extinction threshold ; as a consequence , time translation invariance is broken , and physical aging governed by universal scaling features emerges .",
    "our measured aging scaling exponents are close to those found previously for the contact process , which is perhaps the simplest lattice realization of the directed percolation universality class .",
    "we remark that at least to our knowledge , this present study constitutes only the second investigation of aging scaling at an active - to - absorbing phase transition , and hence provides a crucial test of universality for non - equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "we also emphasize that universal aging scaling sets in considerably earlier during the system s time evolution than asymptotic quasi - stationary power laws emerge , and in addition often yields more accurate exponent estimates @xcite . in comparison with detecting critical slowing - down , this critical aging effect might thus serve as a preferable and more reliable early warning signal for impending population collapse ."
