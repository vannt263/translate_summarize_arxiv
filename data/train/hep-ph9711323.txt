    "deep inelastic scattering from polarized targets continues to excite interest among both theorists and experimentalists .",
    "when an electron scatters off a spin - one target , such as a deuteron , new information not present in case of a spin - half target can be obtained @xcite .",
    "a new , leading twist tensor - polarized structure function , @xmath0 , can be determined by measuring the cross section from a target aligned along the beam , and subtracting the cross section for an unpolarized target .",
    "the function @xmath0 vanishes if the spin - one target is made up of spin - half nucleons at rest or in a relative @xmath3-wave . in the parton model it measures the difference in the quark momentum distributions of a helicity @xmath4 and @xmath5 target , @xmath6",
    "where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the probability to find a quark with momentum fraction @xmath2 and spin up ( down ) along the @xmath9-axis , in a hadron ( nucleus ) with helicity @xmath10 , moving with infinite momentum along @xmath9-axis .",
    "@xmath0 has not yet been measured experimentally .",
    "two recent papers have studied the effect of multiple scattering on @xmath11 and found large contributions at small-@xmath2 .",
    "our aim is to explore these issues in the context of vector meson dominance ( vmd ) , where some of the uncertainties evident in refs .",
    "@xcite are more explicit . within the range of these uncertainties we find that multiple scattering does produce a large contribution to @xmath0 at small @xmath2 .",
    "our estimates are smaller than those of refs .",
    "@xcite by factors of @xmath12 ",
    "@xmath13 , differences which are not unexpected given the conceptual differences between their approaches and ours .",
    "nikolaev and shfer@xcite use the pomeron structure function in proton to extract the diffractive shadowing contribution .",
    "their results have been presented for @xmath14 .",
    "edelmann _ et al._@xcite estimate @xmath11 by expressing it in terms of @xmath15 .",
    "our analysis does not support such a simple scaling relation between @xmath11 and the shadowing of @xmath16 , although the two originate in the same double scattering mechanism .",
    "furthermore , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite do not specify the scale at which their results should apply .",
    "given these differences of approach , we view our results as qualitative confirmation of the work of refs .",
    "@xcite in a specific , rather well defined , model .",
    "deep inelastic scattering from nuclear targets is usually discussed in the context of the `` convolution model'',@xcite where it is assumed that the constituents of the nucleus scatter incoherently .",
    "an essential assumption of the convolution model is that a quark residing inside the nucleon absorbs the virtual photon ( in a typical dis process ) while the fragments of nucleus and the constituents propagate into the final state without interaction or interference . in the convolution model @xmath11",
    "vanishes if the @xmath17-state admixture in the deuteron is ignored @xcite .",
    "the contribution to @xmath11 from the deuteron @xmath17-state was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with the contribution from double scattering from the two nucleons , which amounts to a coherent contribution to the amplitude . in ref .",
    "@xcite the double scattering process was studied at the parton level .    in the present work",
    ", we investigate the behavior of @xmath0 in a vector meson dominance ( vmd ) @xcite model .",
    "of course deep inelastic scattering at large-@xmath1 should be discussed in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "if taken literally at large @xmath1 , vmd has the wrong @xmath1 dependence .",
    "vmd can be used , however , to provide `` boundary value data ''  _ i.e. _ starting values for parton distribution functions  at low-@xmath1 where the assumptions of vmd are well - founded .",
    "we choose vmd because it lends itself to the treatment of multiple scattering effects that violate the convolution model and may give rise to a significant contribution to @xmath11 .",
    "also , because vector meson production data are available , cross sections necessary for our analysis can be found in the literature .",
    "the cost of this increased certainty is the need to identify a scale @xmath18 to be assigned to the output of the model .",
    "double scattering ( which we will refer to as `` shadowing '' ) and the @xmath17-state admixture in the deuteron play a crucial role in our vmd treatment as they do in refs .",
    "@xcite . according to vmd",
    ", the virtual photon can fluctuate between a bare photon state and a superposition of hadronic states with same quantum numbers as the photon ( @xmath19 ) . in the simplest form of vmd this state",
    "is taken to be a superposition of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the photon vector meson coupling , @xmath25 is the hadronic component of the photon , and @xmath1 is the virtuality of the spacelike virtual photon . as usual in vmd , we assume that the vector meson interacts diffractively with the nucleon and that the @xmath26-dependence of the vmd amplitudes can be taken from vector meson photoproduction .    the vmd contribution to @xmath11 is constrained at both large and small @xmath2 by simple physical effects . for multiple scattering effects to be significant , the time ( or distance ) over which the virtual vector meson can propagate through the target nucleus ( known as the `` coherence length''@xmath27 ) must be long enough for the meson to undergo more than one interaction with the target .",
    "we shall see that the coherence length is determined kinematically by the uncertainty principle . at large bjorken-@xmath2",
    "( @xmath28 ) @xmath29 is smaller than a single nucleon , so double scattering contributions to @xmath11 are suppressed . at small @xmath2 ,",
    "double scattering can be important . in order to contribute to @xmath11",
    "it must distinguish between the helicity @xmath30 and helicity @xmath5 states of the deuteron .",
    "if the amplitude for @xmath31 fell quickly with ( transverse ) momentum transfer , corresponding to long range in impact parameter space , then shadowing could not distinguish the orientation of the nucleons in the deuteron and @xmath11 would be small at small @xmath2 . at the opposite extreme , if @xmath32 were flat in momentum transfer , corresponding to a @xmath33 function in impact parameter , then shadowing would occur only when one nucleon was directly `` in front of '' the other .",
    "the quadrupole admixture in the deuteron wavefunction produces just such a deformation of the wavefunction in one helicity state relative to the other .",
    "the deuteron is a relatively large bound state , and the range of vector meson electroproduction is limited , so the actual situation most closely resembles the second scenario and leads to a significant enhancement in @xmath11 at small @xmath2 .",
    "the paper has been organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the theoretical formulation of the model , reviewing vmd and the double scattering analysis .",
    "section iii contains calculations and results . throughout the paper",
    ", we have attempted to keep the analysis simple and self - explanatory .",
    "@xmath11 measures a tensor ( spin - two ) correlation of the momentum distribution of quarks with the spin of the target in dis .",
    "such a correlation must vanish in a spin-@xmath34 target on account of the wigner - eckart theorem . in principle , any spin - one target can have a non - vanishing @xmath11 .",
    "two nucleons bound in an @xmath3-wave can not give @xmath35 .",
    "what is not so obvious , perhaps , is that a @xmath17-state admixture in a @xmath36 bound state of two nucleons will generically give @xmath37 [ 1,5 ] .",
    "it is well known that the ground state of deutron is not spherically symmetric : it is ( primarily ) an admixture of the states @xmath38 ( @xmath39,@xmath40 ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath42,@xmath40 )",
    ". this admixture produces ( and was first detected through ) the observation of an electromagnetic quadrupole moment of the deuteron .",
    "the observation of a non - zero @xmath11 through the asymmetry @xmath43 probes the same aspects of the nucleon - nucleon force as does the deuteron s quadrupole moment .    to expose the physical significance of various structure functions , it is useful to describe compton scattering in terms of helicity amplitudes .",
    "the lepton scattering cross section from a hadron target involves the hadron tensor @xmath44|p , h_1\\right > \\label{hadtens}\\ ] ] which is the imaginary part of the forward current - hadron scattering amplitude . here",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 are components of the target spin along a quantization axis and @xmath47 is the electromagnetic current .",
    "@xmath48 can be decomposed into a set of four linearly independent structure functions for a spin - half target using parity and time reversal invariance , while for a spin - one target , the number of linearly independent structure function is eight @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath0 can be related to the helicity amplitudes @xmath49 for the process @xmath50 , where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) labels the helicity of the photon ( target ) , and @xmath53 @xmath54 is the polarization vector of photon of helicity @xmath55 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath56 the structure functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 in unpolarized dis of an electron from proton target can be described in terms of the photoabsorption cross section @xmath59 and @xmath60 for transverse ( helicity @xmath61 ) and longitudinal ( helicity @xmath5 ) photons respectively as @xmath62 @xmath63 is the incident virtual photon flux , @xmath64 is its energy in laboratory frame .",
    "taking suitable combinations of helicities we can separate out @xmath11 .",
    "we separate the contributions to @xmath11 into single and double scattering terms .",
    "the single scattering terms are given by the convolution formalism and reflect the @xmath17-state admixture in the deuteron ground state.@xcite .",
    "we put these aside and focus on the double scattering contributions , which are given by ,    @xmath65    where @xmath66 signifies the double scattering shadowing correction contribution to the deuteron cross section , @xmath67 in all cases @xmath68 refers to the cross section for transverse photons  the subscript @xmath69 has been dropped for simplicity .",
    "glauber multiple scattering theory @xcite is usually used to describe the interaction of high energy particles with nuclei .",
    "the basic assumption of the glauber treatment is that the amplitude for a high energy hadron to interact with a nucleus can be built from the scattering amplitude off individual nucleons .",
    "here we shall employ another analysis @xcite that uses a feynman diagram technique , which reduces to the optical model results of glauber theory in the limit of large a with a general one particle nuclear density . the double scattering contribution to photon - nucleus scattering",
    "can be represented diagramatically as shown in fig .",
    "the following assumptions are made in this analysis :   spin and any other internal degrees of freedom are neglected ( except where necessary to isolate @xmath11 ) , all the nucleons are assumed to be equivalent , the momentum transfer from the incident hadron ( here the vector meson ) to target nucleus is small , the nucleus and nucleons are nonrelativistic .",
    "the vector mesons act as the intermediate states during the double scattering .",
    "therefore the double scattering picture looks as in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , and the singularities of the amplitude @xmath70 as a function of momenta of the intermediate vector mesons @xmath71 are isolated .",
    "they correctly correspond to the propagation of the vector meson between nucleons .",
    "we fix the momentum of the virtual photon to be in @xmath9 direction @xmath72 and define @xmath73 .",
    "the momentum @xmath74 of the vector meson can be seen to be @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 are the four - momenta of initial and final nucleon states , @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively , and @xmath80 is the momentum transfer squared . finally , the expression for the double scattering takes the form @xmath81 here n , v represent the nucleon and intermediate vector meson respectively , @xmath82 is the production amplitude for vector mesons ( @xmath83 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , m is nucleon s mass and @xmath84 is the mass of vector meson .",
    "the amplitude @xmath85 depends on the momentum transfer in @xmath26- channel  the subprocess @xmath86 is not limited to the _ forward _ direction . for small @xmath26 , @xmath87 ,",
    "so the @xmath26-dependence determines the range of shadowing in impact parameter space .",
    "even if the nucleons are misaligned in @xmath88 space by a distance of the order of the range of @xmath89 , the vector meson can still undergo a second interaction with the other nucleon .",
    "if the range of the production amplitude in @xmath88 were smaller than the deuteron wavefunction , then we could approximate @xmath85 by its value at @xmath90 . since this is not the case we shall have to integrate over @xmath26 .",
    "the vector meson is not on - shell  hence the @xmath91 .",
    "the energy of the meson state is given by @xmath92 ( for @xmath93 ) , @xmath94 .",
    "the energy difference that defines the virtuality of the vector meson is therefore given by @xmath95 , which for large values of photon energy can be written as @xmath96 .",
    "therefore the vector mesons can exist for a time @xmath97 , and can propagate a distance @xmath29 , called its coherence length , @xmath98 , @xmath99 for significant shadowing or double scattering to occur , the coherence length of the intermediate vector meson should be of order the typical internucleon separation in the nucleus , @xmath100 fm .",
    "thus , these effects increase as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "multiple scattering is most prominant at small @xmath2 and for low - mass vector mesons .",
    "one can thus justify the use of only lowest mass vector mesons in the present case .",
    "our model resembles partonic approaches to low-@xmath1 shadowing ( see for example @xcite ) , where the virtual photon converts to a @xmath101 pair at a distance before the target proportional to @xmath102 in the laboratory frame .",
    "shadowing is then explained in terms of @xmath103nucleon scattering amplitude .",
    "the symmetric @xmath104 pairs at not too large @xmath1 , with a transverse separation @xmath105 can be viewed as a meson , the strong color interaction between quark and antiquark increasing with increasing separation .",
    "now we return to eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) .",
    "the optical theorem relates the total cross section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude as @xmath106 , with @xmath107 the total center of mass energy of the @xmath108-@xmath109 system , @xmath110 , @xmath111 . to simplify eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) , we carry out the @xmath112 integration . given the sign of the exponential , only the singularity in upper half @xmath113 plane contributes .",
    "since the vector meson interacts diffractively with the nucleon , the double scattering diagram looks as shown in fig .",
    "the optical theorem relates the resulting on - shell amplitude to the differential cross section for vector meson photoprodution , @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "we estimate the @xmath26-dependence from photoproduction data where @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 vector - mesons respectively .",
    "next , we consider the deuteron form factor terms in eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) .",
    "we can write the deuteron wavefunction as mixture of @xmath3-and @xmath17-states ( @xmath119 ) @xmath120 where @xmath121 s are the spherical harmonics and @xmath122 s are the spin wave functions .",

    "( [ looks ] ) . with similar arguments",
    ", the shadowing contribution to the unpolarized structure function can be shown to be @xmath133 since the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons takes place via pomeron exchange , the differential cross section for forward scattering is of the form @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the soft pomeron intercept .",
    "thus it can be seen that the scaling violations in @xmath136 are of the order of @xmath137 , and the contribution vanishes at large @xmath1 . in these models",
    ", structure function vanishes at large @xmath1 and scaling can be restored within the context of the model only if one takes into account the continuum of heavier mesons ( gvmd ) .",
    "rather , we take the point of view that vmd should not describe the @xmath1 dependence because it is intrinsically a low-@xmath1 effective theory .",
    "vmd provides an estimate of certain ( in this case multiple scattering ) contributions to the structure function at a low scale , which are then mapped into the large-@xmath1 domain by standard qcd evolution .",
    "the resulting behavior of @xmath136 using eq .",

    "that @xmath11 vanishes at @xmath153 is clear from eq .",
    "( [ looks ] ) .",
    "it vanishes at large @xmath1 because the vector meson propagators and the vector meson electroproduction cross section both fall with @xmath1 .",
