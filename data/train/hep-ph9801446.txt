    "the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the subsequent gauge hierarchy problem @xcite are two large mysteries of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite provides a promising solution to these problems , by both stabilising the weak scale against radiative corrections@xcite , and by naturally breaking the electroweak symmetry through the quantum corrections of the superpartner of the top quark to the higgs boson mass @xcite .",
    "it is known , however , that generic weak scale values for the masses of the first two generation scalars give rates for many flavour violating processes that are in disagreement with the experimental observation .",
    "the measured value of @xmath0 and detection limits for @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , for example , require that the first two generation scalars be degenerate to within a few tenths of a percent if their masses are at the weak scale @xcite .",
    "constraints from @xmath7 violation are generally even more severe .",
    "understanding the origin of this degeneracy is the supersymmetric flavour problem .",
    "attempts to resolve this puzzle without introducing any fine tuning include : using approximate non - abelian or abelian symmetries@xcite ; communicating supersymmetry breaking to the visible sector by gauge interactions that do not distinguish between flavours @xcite ; squark - quark mass matrix alignment @xcite ; and raising the soft masses of the first two generation scalars to the tens of tev range @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological viability and naturalness of this last scenario is the subject of this paper . to suppress flavour changing processes",
    ", the heavy scalars must have masses between a few tev and a hundred tev .",
    "the actual value depends on the degree of degeneracy and mixing between the masses of the first two generation scalars . as discussed in reference",
    "@xcite , the masses of the heavy scalars can not be made arbitrarily large without breaking colour and charge .",
    "this is because the heavy scalar masses contribute to the two - loop renormalisation group equation ( rge ) for the soft masses of the light scalars , such that the stop soft mass squared become more negative in rg scaling to smaller energy scales .",
    "this negative contribution is large if the scale at which supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the visible sector is close to the grand unification scale@xcite . with the first two generation soft scalar masses @xmath8 10 tev ,",
    "the initial value of the soft masses for the light stops must be @xmath9 tev@xmath10 to cancel this negative contribution @xcite to obtain the correct vaccum .",
    "this requires , however , an unnatural amount of fine tuning to correctly break the electroweak symmetry@xcite .    in this paper we analyse these issues and include two new items not previously discussed within this context : the effect of the large top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath11 , in the rg evolution , that drives the stop soft mass squared more negative ; and qcd radiative corrections in the @xmath0 constraint @xcite .",
    "this modifies the bound on the heavy scalar masses which is consistent with the measured value of @xmath0 .",
    "this , in turn , affects the minimum value of the initial scalar masses that is required to keep the scalar masses positive at the weak scale .",
    "we note that the severe constraint obtained for the initial stop masses assumes that supersymmetry breaking occurs at a high scale .",
    "this leaves open the possibility that requiring positivity of the scalar masses is not a strong constraint if the scale of supersymmetry breaking is not much larger than the mass scale of the heavy scalars . in this paper",
    "we investigate this possibility by computing the finite parts of the same two - loop diagrams responsible for the negative contribution to the light scalar rg equation , and use these results as an _ estimate _ of the two - loop contribution in an actual model of low - energy supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we find that in certain classes of models , requiring positivity of the soft masses may place strong necessary conditions that such models must satisfy in order to be phenomenologically viable .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 an overview of the ingredients of our analysis",
    "is presented .",
    "some philosophy and notation is discussed .",
    "section 2.1 discusses the constraints on the masses and mixings of the first two generation scalars obtained from @xmath0 after including qcd corrections .",
    "it is found , in particular , that cabibbo - like mixing among both the first two generation left - handed squarks and right - handed squarks requires them to be heavier than 40 tev .",
    "section 2.2 discusses the logic of our rg analysis , and some formulas are presented .",
    "this analysis is independent of the @xmath0 analysis .",
    "sections 3 and 4 apply this machinery to the cases of low - energy and high - energy supersymmetry breaking , respectively .",
    "section 3 deals with the case in which the scale at which susy breaking is communicated to the sm sparticles is close to the mass of the heavy scalars .",
    "we use the finite parts of the two - loop diagrams to estimate the negative contribution of the heavy scalars .",
    "we find that cabibbo - like mixing among the left - handed and right - handed first two generation squarks implies that the boundary value of the stop masses has to greater than @xmath3 tev to keep the stop mass squareds positive at the weak scale .",
    "this results in a fine tuning of naively @xmath12 in electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the cases where there is @xmath13 mixing among only the right or left squarks of the first two generations , and find that requiring positivity of the slepton mass squareds implies a constraint on the stop masses of @xmath14 tev if gauge - mediated boundary conditions are used to relate the two masses .",
    "this is comparable to the direct constraint on the initial stop masses . in section 4 , we consider the case where the susy breaking masses for the sm sparticles are generated at a high scale ( @xmath15 gev ) . in this case , the negative contribution of the heavy scalars is enhanced by a large logarithm .",
    "we consider various boundary conditions for the stop and higgs masses and find that with @xmath16 degeneracy between the first two generation squarks , the boundary value of the stop mass needs to be larger than @xmath2 tev .",
    "this gives a fine tuning of naively @xmath17@xcite . for @xmath13",
    "mixing between the left ( right ) squarks only , the minimum initial value of the stop is @xmath18 tev . in section 5",
    "the scale of supersymmetry breaking is varied between 50 tev and @xmath19 gev .",
    "uppers bounds on the amount of degneracy required between the first two generation scalars , that is consistent with positivity of the light scalar masses , naturalness in electroweak symmetry breaking , and the measured value of @xmath0 , are obtained .",
    "these results are summarized in figures [ m2ftd1 ] and [ m2ftd2 ] .",
    "we conclude in section 6 . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss the computation of the two - loop diagrams which give the negative contribution of the heavy scalars to the light scalar mass squareds .",
    "the chiral particle content of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains 3 generations of @xmath20+@xmath21 representations of @xmath22 .",
    "the supersymmetry must be softly broken to not be excluded by experiment .",
    "thus the theory must also be supplemented by some ` bare ' soft supersymmetry breaking parameters , as well as a physical cutoff , @xmath23 .",
    "the ` bare ' soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are then the coefficients appearing in the lagrangian , defined with a cutoff @xmath23 .",
    "it will be assumed for simplicity that the bare soft masses , @xmath24 , the bare gaugino masses @xmath25 , and a bare trilinear term for the stops , @xmath26 , are all generated close to this scale .",
    "the mssm is then a good effective theory at energies below the scale @xmath23 , but above the mass of the heaviest superpartner .",
    "the physical observables at low - energies will depend on these parameters .",
    "if an unnatural degree of cancellation is required between the bare parameters of the theory to produce a measured observable , the theory may be considered to be fine tuned .",
    "of course , it is possible that a more fundamental theory may resolve in a natural manner the apparent fine tuning .",
    "the gauge - hierarchy problem is a well - known example of this .",
    "the higgs boson mass of the sm is fine tuned if the sm is valid at energies above a few tev .",
    "this fine tuning is removed if at energies close to the weak scale the sm is replaced by a more fundamental theory that is supersymmetric@xcite .",
    "one quantification of the fine tuning of an observable @xmath27 with respect to a bare parameter @xmath28 is given by barbieri - giudice @xcite to be @xmath29 it is argued that this only measures the sensitivity of @xmath27 to @xmath28 , and care should be taken when interpreting whether a large value of @xmath30 necessarily implies that @xmath27 is fine tuned @xcite .",
    "it is not the intent of this paper to quantify fine tuning ; rather , an estimate of the fine tuning is sufficient and equation [ ft ] will be used . in this paper the value of @xmath27",
    "is considered extremely unnatural if @xmath31 .",
    "the theoretical prediction for @xmath0 ( within the mssm ) and its measured value are an example of such a fine tuning : why should the masses of the first two generation scalars be degenerate to within 1 gev , when their masses are @xmath32 ?",
    "phrased differently , the first two generation scalars must be extremely degenerate for the mssm to not be excluded by the measured value of @xmath0 . an important direction in supersymmetry model building",
    "is aimed at attempting to explain the origin of this degeneracy .",
    "one proposed solution to avoid this fine tuning is to decouple the first two generation scalars since their masses are the most stringently constrained by the flavour violating processes @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "some of the first two generation scalars have masses @xmath33 . to introduce some notation",
    ", @xmath34 @xmath35 will denote the number of @xmath20 @xmath36 scalars of the mssm particle content that are very heavy .",
    "multiplets to avoid a large fayet - illiopoulus @xmath37 term at the one - loop level@xcite . ]",
    "thus at energy scales @xmath38 the particle content is that of the mssm , minus the @xmath34 @xmath20 and @xmath39 * 10 * scalars . in the literature",
    "this is often referred to as ` the more minimal supersymmetric standard model'@xcite .",
    "there are , however , other possible and _ equally valid _ sources of fine tunings .",
    "the measured value of the @xmath4 mass is such an example @xcite .",
    "the minimum of the renormalized higgs potential determines the value of the @xmath4 mass which is already known from experiment . the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field is , in turn , a function of the bare parameters of the theory .",
    "the relation used here , valid at the tree - level , is @xmath40 it is clear from this equation that requiring correct electroweak symmetry breaking relates the value of the soft higgs masses at the weak scale , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , to the supersymmetric higgs mass @xmath43 .",
    "a numerical computation determines the dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath41 on the bare parameters @xmath25 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the mssm , the cancellation required between the bare parameters of the theory for it not to be excluded by the @xmath4 mass increases as the scale of supersymmetry breaking",
    "is increased .",
    "typically , the bare mass of the gluino , stops , and the first two generation squarks must be less than a few tev and ten tev , respectively , for successful electroweak symmetry breaking not to be fine tuned at more than the one per cent level @xcite .    these two potential fine tuning problems- the supersymmetric flavour problem and that of electroweak symmetry breaking- are not completely independent , for they both relate to the size of supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "thus the consistency of any theoretical framework that attempts to resolve one fine tuning issue can be tested by requiring that it not reintroduce any comparable fine tunings in other sectors of the theory .",
    "this is the situation for the case under consideration here .",
    "raising the masses of the first two generation scalars can resolve the supersymmetric flavour problem .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this results in a fine tuning of @xmath46 through the two - loop dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath45 .",
    "there is , however , another source of fine tuning of @xmath47 due to the heavy scalars : these large masses require that the bare masses of the stops , in particular , be typically larger than a few tev to keep the soft masses squared positive at the weak scale @xcite .",
    "this large value for the bare stop mass prefers a large value for the vev of the higgs field , thus introducing a fine tuning in the electroweak sector .",
    "further , this fine tuning is typically not less than the original fine tuning in the flavour sector .",
    "this is the central issue of this paper .      at the one - loop level",
    "the exchange of gluinos and squarks generates a @xmath48 operator . in the limit @xmath49 that we are interested in , the @xmath48 effective lagrangian at the scale @xmath45 obtained by integrating out the squarks",

    "we have computed the other anomalous dimensions and our result agrees with that of @xcite ( see this reference for a more general analysis of qcd corrections to the susy contributions to @xmath73 mixing ) .",

    "so while these finite parts should be viewed as semi - quantitative , they should suffice for a discussion of the fine tuning that results from the limit on the bare stop mass . for the case of high scale susy breaking ,",
    "the rg logarithm is large and so the finite parts are not that important .    our numerical analysis for either low - energy or high - energy supersymmetry breaking is described as follows .",

    "we note that since the two - loop information included in our rg analysis is the leading @xmath169 effect , it is sufficient to only use tree - level matching at the scale @xmath166 .",

    "the physical mass of a scalar is equal to the sum of the soft scalar mass , the electro - weak @xmath37term , the supersymmetric contribution , and some finite one - loop and two - loop contributions . as mentioned in the previous paragraph , in the effective theory below @xmath45 the finite two - loop part from the heavy scalars",
    "is included in value of the soft scalar mass of the light sparticles at the boundary , defined at @xmath173 .",
    "the finite one - loop contributions are proportional to the gaugino and other light scalar masses , and are smaller than the corresponding logarithm that is summed in @xmath174 .",

    "the supersymmetric contribution is negligible . in what follows then",
    ", we will require that @xmath175 for scalars other than the stops .",
    "the discussion with the stops is complicated by both the large supersymmetric contribution , @xmath176 , to the physical mass and by the @xmath177 mixing between the gauge eigenstates .",
    "this mixing results in a state with mass squared less than @xmath178 , so it is a conservative assumption to require that for both gauge eigenstates the value of @xmath179 is larger than the experimental limit .",

    "it will be shown that the limit on the initial squark masses is @xmath116 1 tev , so this approximation is consistent .",
    "we then combine the above two analyses as follows .",
    "the @xmath0 constraints of section [ mk ] determine a minimum value for @xmath45 once some theoretical preference for the @xmath187 s is given .",
    "either a natural value for the @xmath187 s is predicted by some model , or the @xmath187 s are arbitrary and chosen solely by naturalness considerations .",
    "namely , in the latter case the fine tuning to suppress @xmath0 is roughly @xmath188 .",
    "further , a model may also predict the ratio @xmath189 .",
    "otherwise , equations [ ft ] and [ muew ] may be used as a rough guide to determine an upper value for @xmath190 , based upon naturalness considerations of the @xmath4 mass . without such a limitation ,",
    "the positivity requirements are completely irrelevant if the bare gluino mass is suffuciently large ; but then the @xmath4 mass is fine tuned . using these values of @xmath190 and @xmath45 , the rge analysis gives a minimum value for the initial stop masses which is consistent with @xmath0 and positivity of the soft masses .",
    "this translates into some fine tuning of the @xmath4 mass , which is then roughly quantified by equations [ ft ] and [ muew ] .",
    "finally , we remark that our analysis may also be extended to include models that contain a fayet - illiopoulos hypercharge @xmath37term , @xmath191 , at the tree - level .",
    "the effect of the @xmath37term is to shift the soft scalar masses , @xmath192 . in this case",
    ", the positivity analysis applies to @xmath24 , rather than @xmath193 .",
    "in this section we investigate the positivity requirement within a framework that satisifes both of the following : ( i ) supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the visible sector at low energies ; and ( ii ) multi - tev scale soft masses , @xmath45 , are generated for some of the first two generation scalars .",
    "this differs from the usual low - energy supersymmetry breaking scenario in that we assume @xmath194 . in the absence of a specific model , however , it is difficult to obtain from the positivity criterion robust constraints on the scalar spectra for the following reasons . at the scale @xmath23",
    "it is expected that , in addition to the heavy scalars of the mssm , there are particles that may have sm quantum numbers and supersymmetry breaking mass parameters .",
    "all these extra states contribute to the soft scalar masses of the light particles .",
    "the sign of this contribution depends on , among other things , whether the soft mass squared for these additional particles is positive or negative - clearly very model - dependent .",
    "the total two - loop contribution to the light scalar masses is thus a sum of a model - dependent part and a model independent part .",
    "by considering only the model - independent contribution we have only isolated one particular contribution to the total value of the soft scalar masses near the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "we will , however , use these results to _ estimate _ the typical size of the finite parts in an actual model .",

    "the @xmath119-scalars receive , at one - loop , a divergent contribution to their mass , proportional to the supertrace of the mass matrix of the matter fields . neglecting the fermion masses , this contribution is @xmath531 in our notation @xmath532 .",
    "poppitz and trivedi choose the counterterm to cancel this divergence in the @xmath533 scheme , _",
    "i.e. _ , the counterterm consists only of the divergent part , proportional to @xmath534 .",
    "when this counterterm is inserted in a one - loop @xmath119-scalar graph with sm fields ( scalars ) as the external lines , one obtains a divergent contribution to the sm scalar soft masses ( the @xmath534 of the counterterm is cancelled after summing over the @xmath119 adjoint scalars running in the loop ) .",
    "poppitz and trivedi use a cut - off , @xmath535 , to regulate this graph , giving a contribution from this graph that is : @xmath536 with no finite part .",

    "i.e. _ , proportional to @xmath537 ( where @xmath538 is the euler constant ) and use dimensional reduction to regulate the graph with the insertion of the counterterm .",
    "this gives a contribution @xmath539 in the first line the first factor of @xmath540 is from the counter - term insertion , the second factor is the result of the loop integral , and the over - all factor of @xmath119 counts the number of @xmath119-scalars running in the loop . in the @xmath152 scheme , _",
    "i.e. _ , after subtracting @xmath537 , we are left with a finite part scheme , regulated with @xmath541 . ] proportional to @xmath542 .",
    "the remaining diagrams together give a finite result and we agree with poppitz and trivedi on this computation .",
    "our result for the finite part of the two - loop diagrams ( neglecting the fermion masses ) is @xmath543 whereas the poppitz - trivedi result does not have the @xmath544 in the above result .",
    "the computation of the two - loop hypercharge @xmath135-term , which gives contribution to the soft scalar mass squareds proportional to @xmath545 and @xmath546 ( _ i.e. _ , the \" mixed  two - loop contributon ) is discussed below in detail .",
    "we compute the two - loop diagrams of figure [ mixedtwoloopdiag ] in the feynman gauge and set all fermion and gaugino masses to zero .",
    "it is convienent to calculate in this gauge because both the scalar self - energy and the @xmath547-term vertex corrections are finite at one - loop and thus require no counter - terms .",
    "we have also computed the two - loop diagrams in the landau gauge and have found that it agrees with the calculation in the feynman gauge .",
    "the calculation in the landau gauge requires counter - terms , is more involved , and hence the discussion is not included . finally , in the calculation a global @xmath22 symmetry is assumed so that a hypercharge @xmath135-term is not generated at one - loop @xcite .",
    "the sum of the four feynman diagrams in figure [ mixedtwoloopdiag ] is given in the feynman gauge by @xmath548 where the trace is over the gauge and flavour states of the particles in the loops .",
    "if the particles in the loop form complete @xmath549 and @xmath483 representations with a common mass @xmath45 , the sum simplifies to @xmath550                        we may now combine @xmath551 , @xmath552 and @xmath553 to obtain @xmath564 writing @xmath532 and expanding in @xmath119 gives @xmath565 in the @xmath152 scheme the combination @xmath566 is subtracted out . the finite piece that remains is @xmath567 thus in the @xmath152 scheme @xmath568"
