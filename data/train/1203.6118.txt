    "in a spin system with isotropic exchange the absorption spectrum of ac magnetic field is a @xmath4-peak at @xmath5 , where @xmath1 is the zeeman splitting , independently of the exchange interaction strength@xcite .",
    "similarly to the kohn theorem for cyclotron resonance@xcite , this fact is the consequence of coupling of spatially homogeneous exciting field to the center of mass of the system .",
    "therefore , any deviation of the absorption spectrum from the @xmath4-shape implies a violation of the spin - rotation symmetry which is either due to anisotropic terms in the hamiltonian or due to development of spontaneous ordering below critical temperature .",

    "in these cases the above statement becomes exact .",
    "note also that the symmetry alone , namely the oddness of the spin - orbit interaction in eq . under the spatial inversion , dictates that the spin - orbit interaction of spinons has the same functional form .",
    "the last term in eq . represents zeeman coupling of electron s spin to the external magnetic field , @xmath36 , which does not involve charge degrees of freedom at all , and thus preserves its form for spinons as well .",

    "for the sake of argument we do not consider these processes here : for example  orbital \" coupling is absent in geometry where magnetic field is parallel to the two - dimensional layer .",

    "this feature of the slave - rotor theory makes it clear that , as long as the spin - orbit and zeeman interactions are small perturbations to electron s hamiltonian ( which , practically speaking , is always the case ) , the spinon sector of the hubbard model must be described by eq .",
    ", so that the spatial structure of the spinon spin - orbit coupling , @xmath40 , inherits that of the electron spin - orbit term in eq . .",
    "here it means that spin - orbit part of eq .",
    "is given in the momentum space by eq .",
    "when electron operators @xmath41 are replaced by spinon @xmath42 ones .    finally , the spin - liquid phase we are interested in is just a disordered ( mott ) phase of @xmath32 , in which the expectation value of the rotor field is zero , @xmath43 , and the charge degrees of freedom are gapped .",
    "( the phase with a condensate of charge rotor field @xmath44 describes the usual metallic phase of eq . and is not of interest here . )",
    "importantly , spin excitations of this phase are neutral spinons , @xmath25 , forming the fermi - liquid state and described by the hamiltonian eq . with parameters which are renormalized by the gapped charge fluctuations ( the notion that spinons can be treated as neutral fermions @xcite has an important caveat that they interact strongly with emerging gauge field @xcite ) .",
    "we thus see that , under the assumptions described above , the hamiltonian of strongly interacting fermi system eq . in the spin - liquid phase maps onto that of non - interacting spinon fermi gas with spin - orbit interaction of rashba type .",
    "hence , the basic features of the esr response in an exotic spin liquid state can be captured within a much simpler model of two - dimensional electron gas subject to spin - orbit interaction .",

    "when only the lowest transverse subband is populated , the esr lineshape will be reduced to two delta - function like features at the lower and upper boundaries of the esr continuum .",
    "this is exactly the response found previously@xcite within a different , purely one - dimensional treatment of an insulating heisenberg spin chain with uniform dm interaction .",
    ". finds a very similar response of a conducting quantum wire with spin - orbit interaction to ac electric field .",
    "the correspondence between the two above mentioned one - dimensional studies illustrates nicely the central point of our work that esr is an effective probe of the fermi surfaces irrespective of their origin . both conventional fermi surface@xcite and spinon fermi surface@xcite",
    "give rise to the same esr response .",
    "one - dimensional geometry also allows one to address effects of electron - electron interactions omitted in the present work .",
    "although relatively marginal even in one - dimensional geometry @xcite , these are difficult to account for at finite frequencies as recent detailed investigation shows @xcite . extending this approach to two - dimensional systems , along the lines of renormalization group calculations in @xcite , represents an interesting outstanding problem .    throughout the paper we neglected the disorder .",
    "in realistic sample , with finite disorder , the absorption peak calculated above will always reside on the background of the drude peak coming from the intraband scattering .",
    "the condition that disorder does not smear the interband absorption peak reads : @xmath282 , where @xmath283 is the scattering time . under this condition , the peak which we calculated is distinguishable , since the background is relatively flat .",
    "however , in order for interband peak to dominate over the intraband contribution , a more stringent condition must be met .",
    "namely , the products @xmath284 must exceed @xmath285 .    it is worth noting that ideas outlined here have been recently successfully tested experimentally @xcite in quasi - one - dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnet cs@xmath21cucl@xmath286 where uniform dm interaction on chain bonds was found to split the esr signal into two peaks already in the finite - temperature spin - liquid phase , just as we describe above .",
    "many higher - dimensional candidate spin - liquid materials , such as two - dimensional @xmath287-(bedt - ttf)@xmath21cu@xmath21(cn)@xmath22 @xcite and three - dimensional na@xmath286ir@xmath22o@xmath288 @xcite , have been argued to possess spin - liquid ground states with spinon fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "dm and other kinds of spin - orbit interactions are most certain to be present in these materials  this is certainly the case for na@xmath286ir@xmath22o@xmath288 and highly likely for the organic material as well ( its close relative , @xmath287-(bedt - ttf)@xmath21cu[n(cn)@xmath21]cl , does have substantial dm interaction @xcite ) .",
    "our work shows that spin - orbit interaction can turn esr absorption experiment into a insightful probe of the unusual spinon fermi surfaces in these and related materials .",
