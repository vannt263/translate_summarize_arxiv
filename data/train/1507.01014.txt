    "we sketch some of the most closely related variational principles and provide a short summary on gradient flows .",
    "the body of literature , both classic and recent , on these two topics is too large to be reviewed comprehensively here .",
    "onsager , in his celebrated papers  @xcite generalized the transport laws , such as those by fourier , ohm or fick , to account for a possible coupling between different physical processes .",
    "he proposed a general linear kinematic constitutive relation between fluxes @xmath4 and forces @xmath5 , that is , @xmath6 .",
    "the conductivity matrix @xmath7 may depend on the state variables ( temperature , pressure , chemical potential , etc . ) , but not on their gradient  @xcite , and is symmetric as a result of the time reversal of the underlying atomistic equations of motion , @xmath8 .",
    "these two properties of the constitutive relations  linearity and symmetry of the conductivity tensor  can be equivalently expressed by means of the _ principle of least dissipation of energy _",
    "@xcite ( following rayleigh s nomenclature  @xcite ) .",
    "namely , let @xmath9 be the entropy production and @xmath10 denote a local dissipation potential , with the resistivity tensor @xmath11 being positive definite , then the variational principle reads @xmath12.\\ ] ] in onsager s words  @xcite , ` the rate of increase of the entropy plays the role of a potential ' .",
    "several generalizations of this extremum principle have since emerged in different fields encompassing climate @xcite , soft matter physics  @xcite , plasticity @xcite , biology @xcite and quantum mechanics @xcite among others , and appear under the names of _ maximum entropy production principles_(mepps ) @xcite and _ steepest entropy ascent _ ( sea ) @xcite .",
    "this latter framework provides a geometric interpretation of the resistivity tensor @xmath13 and generalizes @xmath14 to arbitrary ( but a priori unknown ) metric spaces .",
    "another approach to nonequilibrium thermodynamics , which combines reversible and irreversible dynamics , is the general equation for nonequilibrium reversible - irreversible coupling ( generic )  @xcite .",
    "the structure of this formalism can be derived using contact forms in the setting of the gibbs - legendre manifold  @xcite ; it can be cast variationally ; and it allows for a systematic multiscale approach  @xcite as well as a treatment of fluctuations  @xcite .    [ t ]      from a mathematical perspective , purely dissipative evolution equations can often be described as _ gradient flow structures _",
    "this means that the vectorial variable @xmath1 of interest ( components are , for example , energy , density or interface position ) evolves according to the steepest ascent of a functional @xmath2 ( or descent for @xmath15 ) in a geometry given by a metric associated with a positive semi - definite operator @xmath3 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 if the inverse is defined , and @xmath18 is a force .",
    "note that   is precisely the irreversible component of generic .",
    "then @xmath2 is a lyapunov functional , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the dual parity between elements of the tangent and the cotangent space .",
    "two common examples of are the @xmath21 flow and wasserstein flow  @xcite , written for scalar - valued @xmath22 as @xmath23 respectively , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 positive semi - definite .",
    "the latter equation is symbolically expressed as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    "further details on the weak formulations of both flows and the norms involved are given in the appendix .",
    "it is noteworthy that the same equation can have different gradient flow representations .",
    "for example , the diffusion equation @xmath28 can be interpreted both as @xmath29 flow ( with mobility @xmath30 and dirichlet integral @xmath31 ) and wasserstein flow ( with mobility @xmath32 and boltzmann entropy @xmath33 ) .",
    "the wasserstein formulation is a natural choice since it involves the physical entropy .",
    "this flow and its associated metric will be automatically singled out by the variational principle proposed here , as we show next .",
    "in this section , we present a new variational principle for purely dissipative evolution equations based on the _ ansatz _ that systems evolve in the direction of maximum entropy production ( see eq .   below )  , so as to reach the equilibrium configuration as fast as possible .",
    "the philosophy is therefore similar to sea and mepps , yet different in its detailed formulation . in particular",
    ", the proposed principle will provide a direct relation between the operator @xmath3 and physical constraints in the system , thus shedding some light on the geometry of dissipative equations . for simplicity ,",
    "we first consider closed systems defined by a scalar variable and later generalize the obtained results to open systems and the vectorial setting .",
    "illustrative examples are then chosen to demonstrate the applicability of the principle for both conserved and non - conserved fields , with explicit consideration of the boundary conditions .",
    "we note that non - conserved quantities do not have a flux associated to them , and therefore lie outside of the direct scope of onsager s",
    "principle  .    for a closed system out of equilibrium characterized by a scalar state variable @xmath22 ,",
    "the maximum entropy production ansatz is mathematically equivalent to the search of the velocity @xmath34 maximizing @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the entropy density and @xmath2 the total entropy of the system .",
    "the maximization is pointwise in the tangent space for fixed @xmath22 , c.f .",
    "[ fig : constrainedmaximization ] .",
    "however , this problem is not well - posed unless the length of the vector @xmath34 is prescribed , in which case the problem is reduced to the search of the optimal direction .",
    "this constraint is easily incorporated with a lagrange multiplier , yielding a variational principle with lagrangian @xmath37 = \\langle ds(z),\\dot{z } \\rangle -   \\langle \\dot{z},\\eta(z ) \\dot{z}\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the precise value of the length , which may depend on @xmath22 , has been obviated since it does not participate in variations for fixed @xmath22 .",
    "the evolution is then obtained by variations of   with respect to @xmath38 , giving @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , since entropy would decrease otherwise .",
    "this shows that the @xmath21 gradient flow with functional @xmath2 naturally results from the maximum entropy production principle in the absence of any physical constraint .    however , the evolution of @xmath22 is often subjected to conservation constraints of the form @xmath41 which naturally occurs when @xmath22 represents mass or energy . in this situation ,",
    "the maximal dissipation occurs within the manifold of conserved @xmath22 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 on the boundary @xmath44 for a closed system . with an additional lagrange multiplier @xmath45 , the variational principle at each point",
    "@xmath22 can then be written as @xmath46 = \\langle ds,\\dot{z } \\rangle - \\langle \\lambda(z ) , \\dot{z}+ \\nabla \\cdot { \\mathbf{j}}\\rangle - \\langle { \\mathbf{j } } , \\mathbf{h}(z ) { \\mathbf{j}}\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the length constraint ( measured with metric tensor @xmath47 ) has now been placed on the unknown variable @xmath4 .",
    "we note that constraining the length of @xmath34 as in would leave @xmath4 partially undetermined , and so would be the constitutive relations , such as fourier s law for the case of heat conduction .",
    "variation with respect to @xmath4 in delivers @xmath48 which , after integration by parts , yields @xmath49 .",
    "variations with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath45 give @xmath50 altogether , this leads to a wasserstein gradient flow with functional @xmath2 and weight @xmath51 positive semi - definite , @xmath52 .",
    "the wasserstein gradient flow can be thus be understood as an @xmath53 gradient flow restricted to the manifold of conserved quantities .    in general ,",
    "systems are characterized by a set of state variables @xmath1 , some of which are conserved , @xmath54 , ( e.g. , energy , concentration ) , and some of which are not , @xmath55 , ( e.g. , interface position ) , i.e. , @xmath56^t$ ] . in this case",
    "the variational principle can be written as @xmath57 = \\langle ds,\\dot{{\\mathbf{z } } } \\rangle - \\langle \\lambda({\\mathbf{z } } ) , \\dot{{\\mathbf{z}}}_c+ \\nabla \\cdot { \\mathbf{j}}\\rangle   - \\langle { \\mathbf{j } } , \\mathbf{h}_c({\\mathbf{z } } ) { \\mathbf{j}}\\rangle   \\\\ - \\langle \\dot{{\\mathbf{z}}}_u,\\mathbf{h}_u({\\mathbf{z } } ) \\dot{{\\mathbf{z}}}_u\\rangle,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where now @xmath58 is a vectorial lagrange multiplier , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are second - order tensors .",
    "similar derivations as above yield the evolution equations @xmath61 which have an analogous structure to those previously obtained .",
    "however , for anisotropic materials , coupling between variables of different tensorial quantities is possible , and in this case , the lagrangian shall be written as @xmath62 = \\langle ds,\\dot{{\\mathbf{z } } } \\rangle - \\langle \\lambda({\\mathbf{z } } ) , \\dot{{\\mathbf{z}}}_c+ \\nabla \\cdot { \\mathbf{j}}\\rangle \\\\   - \\langle [ \\dot{\\mathbf{z}}_u,\\mathbf{j}]^t , \\mathbf{h}(\\mathbf{z } ) [ \\dot{\\mathbf{z}}_u,\\mathbf{j}]^t \\rangle.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] variations of this functional with respect to @xmath63 and @xmath58 give @xmath64 with @xmath65 . then , the evolution equations read @xmath66 where the symbol @xmath67 indicates how the operator is applied to the vector @xmath68 .",

    "the lagrangian of the maximum entropy production principle is constructed by subtracting the entropy flow entering the boundary of the domain from the total entropy rate .",
    "then the entropy increase considered exclusively originates from the internal production , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "assuming that the system is completely characterized by the internal energy , and taking also the conservation of energy into account , the lagrangian reads @xmath71= \\int_{\\omega } \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial e}\\dot{e } \\",

    "therefore , variations with respect to @xmath76 , @xmath45 and @xmath73 , assuming boundary conditions in @xmath77 ( boundary conditions in @xmath78 would imply @xmath79 on @xmath44 , and lead to the same evolution equation ) yield @xmath80 \\ , dx = 0 \\qquad   \\forall \\delta { \\mathbf{q}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which combined give the equation of heat transfer , with @xmath81 , @xmath82    we remark that the analogous derivation via onsager s principle of least dissipation , i.e. , @xmath83 = { \\mathbf{q}}\\cdot { \\mathbf{x}}- \\frac{1}{2 } { \\mathbf{x}}\\mathbf{l } { \\mathbf{x}},\\quad    \\text{with   } { \\mathbf{x}}= - \\nabla    \\left(\\frac{1}{t } \\right)\\ ] ] leads to fourier s law @xmath84 , which , complemented with the first law of thermodynamics , yields   with @xmath85 .",

    "we note that the derivation of this evolution in the onsager formalism is nontrivial as @xmath86 does not have a flux and a corresponding thermodynamic force .",
    "in this section , we show that the proposed variational formulation for purely dissipative equations based on physical considerations is further supported by a large deviation principle ( ldp ) associated to stochastically perturbed gradient flows .",

    "<S> here descent has to be measured in a metric , which is neither provided by the aforementioned variational approaches , nor it is always intuitive ( e.g. , wasserstein metric for diffusion processes ) . in this article , we establish a variational framework based on the _ ansatz _ of maximal entropy production which sheds light on the geometry of purely dissipative evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> this new approach ( 1 ) delivers a construction of the gradient flow metric from conservation constraints in the variational formulation ; ( 2 ) extends onsager s principle to simultaneously account for conserved and non - conserved quantities in open systems ; and ( 3 ) encloses an infinite - dimensional fluctuation - dissipation statement , as shown from a large deviation argument for stochastically perturbed gradient flows . </S>",
