    "@xcite to the relativistic limit , we have studied systematically the structure of the singularities formed in a relativistically large amplitude plasma wave close to the wavebreaking in a thermal plasma .",
    "we have shown that typically the electron density distribution in the breaking wave has a  peakon \" form with a discontinuous coordinate dependence of its first derivative , similar to the profiles of nonlinear water waves @xcite and that in the above breaking limit the derivative becomes infinite .",
    "this results in a finite reflectivity of an electromagnetic wave interacting with nonlinear plasma waves .",

    "it is the singularity in the electron density distribution that allows for a high efficiency in the reflection of a portion of the counterpropagating electromagnetic pulse .",

    "the singularity in the electron density , moving along with the wake wave excited by a high intensity ultra - short pulse laser , can act as a flying relativistic mirror for counterpropagating electromagnetic radiation , leading to coherent reflection accompanied by the upshift of the radiation frequency .",
