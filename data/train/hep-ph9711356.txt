    "unraveling the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) remains so far a piece of theoretical challenge , and justifies a wealth of experimental endeavor .",
    "even though ( in a `` theory - of - everything '' state of mind ) one assumes that it is ultimately the dynamics at tremendously high energy scales ( gut or planck or even higher ) that should account for the fact that the electroweak vacuum is not ( gauge ) symmetric , a central question remains : + how would this dynamics effectively translate , over tens of orders of magnitude , down to the electroweak scale ?",
    "phenomenological models of supersymmetry offer plausible scenarios for ewsb @xcite triggered by supersymmetry breaking , the latter being presumably connected with dynamics at much higher scales @xcite , @xcite . as is well - known , this _ radiative _ ewsb @xcite is made possible thanks to the heaviness of the top quark whose experimental discovery around @xmath2 revived the interest in such models .",
    "nonetheless , the breaking of the electroweak symmetry is not a matter of fact in these scenarios , in that one has still to enforce _ phenomenologically _ a bounded from below potential and the absence of charge or color breaking minima @xcite .",
    "this is clear indication that the scheme is not yet dynamically complete , and one might ask whether a mechanism can be found which would naturally `` lock '' the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electroweak sector of the theory , at the relevant energy scale . the answer to this is obviously related to the general question asked above , and is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "it will constitute , however , a general motivation for our study .",
    "indeed , an important prerequisite to all this is to improve our understanding of the structure of the effective potential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and with it the sufficiency and necessity of the phenomenological conditions for radiative ewsb .",
    "one would like to assess as much as possible the implications of the softly broken supersymmetry on the structure of the minima , before bringing in more model - dependent information .",
    "for instance , as we will show later on , some constraints involving @xmath1 and usually quoted in a model - dependent context , do have fully model - independent counterparts in the mssm , which are even more stringent !",
    "getting fairly reasonable approximations of the effective potential is not always an easy task , for many reasons .",
    "many papers have been devoted to these aspects in the mssm ( see for instance @xcite ) , however often with the main concern of reproducing a more or less quantitative pattern of the mass spectrum , at the expense of making some rough assumptions about what the radiative ewsb conditions actually are , and about the scale at which they are realized .",
    "this is of course fully justified , but only as a first approximation , as recognized by some authors @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is _ not _ to provide yet another tentative mass spectrum in the context of some approximations , but rather to fit into a more theoretical study of the validity of some of the underlying assumptions .",
    "let us first list , for further reference , the features that should be kept in mind in this context :    _ i ) _ the true effective potential @xmath3 should be renormalization scale invariant .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) improved effective potential @xmath4 can miss large logarithms when there are more than one ( mass ) scale in the theory , as is the case in the mssm . if not properly treated , the scale at which leading logs are actually resummed becomes fuzzy and with it the approximate scale invariance of @xmath4 .",
    "_ ii ) _ the only gauge parameter independent and physically relevant values of @xmath3 are those at stationary points .",
    "_ iii ) _ the `` effective potential '' computed from the 1pi green s functions at vanishing external momenta , can suffer from unwanted concavities ( the true effective potential being always convex ) , precisely in the region where spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs . _",
    "iv ) _ a local minimum is characterized by both @xmath5 _ and _ @xmath6 order derivatives with respect to _ all _ scalar fields in the theory .",
    "_ v ) _ non logarithmic contributions to @xmath3 at a given loop order can alter the qualitative picture of the `` tree - level improved '' effective potential . +",
    "another [ perhaps less stressed ] feature in connection with _",
    "iv ) _ , is that what is usually called `` the condition of electroweak symmetry breaking '' and used as such in the literature , has to do , strictly speaking , only with the requirement of a stationary point of the effective potential in the higgs directions .",
    "this obviously calls for an immediate explanation . in this paper",
    "we will show , in connection with _",
    "iv ) _ and _ v ) _ , that while the stationarity condition is sufficient , as far as the tree - level and `` tree - level improved '' effective potential are concerned , due to a non - trivial connection between @xmath5 and @xmath6 order derivatives , it is no more the case when finite ( non - logarithmic ) one - loop effects are taken into account .",
    "naively , one would argue that such effects can not change much of the qualitative pattern of the tree - level minima .",
    "the fact is that , even if the one - loop effective potential is expected to differ , point - to - point , only perturbatively from its tree - level value , it is still possible that its shape be _ locally _ modified in such a way that new local minima ( or at least stationary points ) appear .",
    "this fact will bring in new supplementary conditions to the usual ewsb ones , determined analytically in a general context .",
    "these conditions will lead in turn to model - independent and calculable exclusion domains of @xmath1 , to compare with some existing model - dependent ones .",
    "furthermore , one will have to assess the necessity and sufficiency for the new conditions .",
    "for this we will have to revisit briefly the question of charge breaking in the higgs sector . +",
    "another relevant aspect which we will consider , has to do with the gauge - fixing dependence of the derived conditions . we will give a simple argument in favour of the gauge - fixing independence , in the sense that the corresponding equations ( and inequalities ) remain satisfied even if there is some gauge - fixing dependence on either side of these equations , that is they are gauge - fixing `` covariant '' .",
    "+ the rest of the paper will be organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the main features of the effective potential in the mssm and present some of the assumptions we make throughout the paper and conventions we use .",
    "section 3 describes what we call the `` tree - level logic '' for the ewsb conditions . in section 4",
    "we give an expression for @xmath0 in the higgs sector , derive the new ewsb conditions at one - loop order in a fully analytic form , and show why the `` tree - level logic '' does not generally hold .",
    "we then derive the model - independent theoretical bounds on @xmath1 .",
    "the contents of this section represent the main results of the paper . in section 5",
    "we discuss the meaning of our constraints and how they compare to the existing ones .",
    "the question of necessity and sufficiency of our conditions is addressed in section 6 .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the question of gauge - fixing dependence .",
    "a first numerical illustration is given in section 8 , in the context of sugra - gut scenarios .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 9 , and some technical material and proofs relegated to the appendix . for a quick summary of the issues presented in this paper the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "this is part of a thorough analytic study of the complete one - loop effective potential in the mssm , where symbolic computation is heavily used @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the word `` stationarity '' will refer to the vanishing of the @xmath5 order derivatives of the effective potential , and the word `` stability '' to the requirement that the eigenvalues of the @xmath6 order derivatives should be positive .",
    "our starting point will be the full fledged mssm with _ a priori _ no model dependent assumptions whatsoever .",
    "the aim of the study is to assess the power of the only assumption of minimal supersymmetry in constraining the various free parameters , once electroweak symmetry breaking is required .",
    "it is nonetheless unavoidable , for practical purposes , to take up a definite point of view , as far as some approximations , usually made in a model - dependent context , are concerned .",
    "for instance , regarding point _",
    "i ) _ of the previous section , it has been emphasized in the literature that the mere replacement of the free parameters by their runnings in the tree - level effective potential , is actually a poor approximation @xcite",
    ". a prominent drawback of this approximation is the rather high sensitivity of the `` improved '' effective potential to the renormalization scale .",
    "it was then observed that the same procedure applied to the one - loop effective potential leads to a better approximation , in the sense that the results are numerically much more stable against the change of renormalization scale . @xcite .",
    "one should , nevertheless , keep in mind that these approximations can not be put in a neat context of leading- ( sub - leading- , etc ... ) log approximations anyway , as long as the case of many different mass and field scales is not properly handled @xcite . for instance , there are still regions where the vev s still suffer a pronounced scale dependence , even to one - loop order @xcite . in a sense",
    ", this should not come as a surprise since not all the logs can be properly resummed this way . for this reason , and since our aim is to study the effects of the non - logarithmic one - loop contributions , we will be contented throughout with the tree - level improved effective potential approximation .    the 1-loop effective potential has the well - known form @xcite @xmath7 \\label{ep}\\ ] ]    in the @xmath8 scheme .",
    "here @xmath9 denotes the renormalization scale , @xmath10 the field dependent squared mass matrix of the scalar fields , and @xmath11 \\equiv \\sum_{spin } ( -1)^{2 s } ( 2 s + 1 ) ( ... ) _ s $ ] , where the sum runs over gauge boson , fermion and scalar contributions .",
    "@xmath12 is the tree - level mssm potential @xcite . as stated above",
    ", we will assume that the logarithms in eq.([ep ] ) are reabsorbed in the running of all the parameters in @xmath13 ) .",
    "this amounts to the rough assumption of neglecting altogether all field and mass scale differences in the logs .",

    "in this section we will show , starting from the potential , eq.([vtree ] ) , that    the requirement of _ boundedness from below _ of the potential , implies that any gauge non - invariant _ stationary _ point in the higgs directions is _ necessarily a local minimum _ , and that the existence of such a point guarantees the instability of the gauge symmetric `` vacuum '' .",
    "this interesting property is common knowledge , but , as far as we know , is seldom stated clearly , let alone shown explicitly .",
    "we do this here for several reasons : first , to stress the fact that this property is not self - evident , but rather a consequence of the special form of eq.([vtree ] ) , _ i.e. _ of ( softly - broken ) supersymmetry ; secondly , because it underlies the reason for which the usual ewsb conditions    @xmath49    used in the literature as _ minimization _ conditions , but which are strictly speaking only stationarity conditions , happen to be safe , _",
    "i.e. _ necessary and sufficient , as far as the effective potential has the form of eq.([vtree ] ) .",

    "since we are mainly interested here in whether a stationary point in the electroweak direction is a local minimum or not , one could argue that it is enough to choose from the start the ( electrically ) neutral directions    @xmath50    as the relevant dynamical variables .",
    "however , this needs further justification .",
    "the doublets @xmath51 , @xmath52 depend each on four real - valued fields so that , as stated in the introduction ( point _ iv ) _ ) , one should determine @xmath5 and @xmath6 order derivatives of @xmath12 with respect to the eight real fields , and then take @xmath53 . gauge freedom to take away three of the eight fields , but the question remains essentially the same . ] nonetheless , it turns out that all @xmath5 order derivatives other than those with respect to the two neutral real components , vanish trivially at @xmath53 .",
    "the two usual stationarity conditions are then indeed the only ones to consider and can be readily obtained from eq.([vtree ] ) as    @xmath54    on the contrary , the @xmath6 order derivatives of the potential yield _  priori _ non trivial information in the eight field directions .",
    "the stability conditions are obtained using the invariants method ( see appendix b ) . substituting for @xmath55 and @xmath56 using eqs .",
    "( [ dtree1 ] , [ dtree2 ] ) one finds five stability conditions ,    @xmath57    plus three zeros corresponding to the three goldstone degrees of freedom . eqs.([dtree1 ] - [ inv4 ] ) are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a _ local _ minimum in the electroweak sector .",
    "we will show now that eqs.([dtree1 ] , [ dtree2 ] ) imply automatically eqs.([inv1 ] - [ inv4 ] ) .",
    "let us first solve for @xmath58 in eqs.([dtree1 ] , [ dtree2 ] ) .",
    "one easily finds ,    @xmath59    it is worthwhile noting at this level that the existence of real solutions in eq.([soltbeta ] ) is guaranteed by the requirement of boundedness from below of @xmath12 .",
    "the conditions of boundedness from below involve necessarily the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and reside entirely in the would - be `` flat directions '' of the potential .",
    "the obvious reason for this is that in exact supersymmetry the potential is positive semi - definite so that only explicit soft breaking terms can make it unbounded from below .",
    "furthermore , the directions along which the potential can turn down negative first , when the soft terms are switched on , are those for which the supersymmetric potential is the closest to zero at arbitrarily large fields .",
    "this happens generically for d - flat or f - flat ( or both ) directions . in the case of eq.([vtree ] ) , the flat directions are d - flat and correspond to @xmath60 a representative direction is , ( modulo a gauge transformation ) , @xmath61 where h denotes any complex valued field .",
    "@xmath12 is quadratic in h along such directions , and the boundedness from below conditions ( bfb ) read ,    @xmath62    with the above conditions , @xmath1 in eq.([soltbeta ] ) is real valued .",
    "more importantly , further inspection of eq.([soltbeta ] ) , in conjunction with eq.([ufbtree ] ) , tells us that @xmath1 and @xmath63 have opposite signs , that is @xmath64 a quick look at the stability conditions eqs.([inv1 ] - [ inv4 ] ) shows then that they are all _ automatically satisfied_.    on the other hand , substituting for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , one gets from eqs([dtree1],[dtree2 ] ) ,    @xmath65    so that eq([oldcond ] ) implies readily @xmath66 _",
    "i.e. , the potential is automatically unstable at zero vevs_.    up to this level , we have used only partially the conditions assuring the existence of a stationary point away from the origin . in particular , the existence of @xmath1 solutions , eq.([soltbeta ] ) , does not guarantee the reality of the vev s , i.e. @xmath67 . to see this ,",
    "let us extract from eqs .",
    "( [ dtree1],[dtree2 ] ) the equation complementary to eq.([soltbeta ] ) , namely ,    @xmath68    where @xmath69 .",
    "it is clear from the above equation that requiring @xmath70 and @xmath71 to have the same sign , i.e. @xmath67 , will lead to extra relations among the @xmath72 s .",
    "the discussion can be carried out in terms of the sign of @xmath73 ( assuming throughout @xmath74 , as is generically the case in susy - gut scenarios ) . if @xmath75 , which is often the case at the electroweak scale is only sufficient to ensure an unstable gauge - invariant vacuum , the necessary ( and sufficient ) condition being eq.([ssb1 ] ) ] , then one has from eq.([solv1v2 ] ) and @xmath76 that @xmath77 is _ excluded _ , and otherwise no extra conditions on the @xmath72 s .",
    "if however @xmath78 , then one can show , given eqs.([soltbeta ] , [ solv1v2 ] ) and the bfb eq.([ufbtree ] ) , that the sufficient and necessary conditions for @xmath79 are simply @xmath80    the first of these two conditions is , however , already a consequence of eq.([soltbeta ] ) as we have shown above .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown in this section that the requirement of boundedness from below eq.([ufbtree ] ) and the conditions of existence of a stationary point at non - vanishing field values eqs([dtree1 ] , [ dtree2 ] ) , imply by themselves that this point is a local minimum eqs.([inv1 ] - [ inv4 ] ) , and that the gauge symmetric point , @xmath81 is energetically unstable eq.([ssb ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the discussion following eq.([solv1v2 ] ) is to remind us that even at tree - level , the model - independent ewsb conditions imply some constraints on the allowed values of @xmath1 , depending on the relative magnitude and/or signs of @xmath82 .",
    "of course , if one implements the information coming from say a sugra - gut scenario together with universality assumptions then the above constraints become stricter as @xmath82 run down from their initial values in a well - defined way . in particular , theoretical upper bounds are known to appear ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main point of the next section is to show that similar constraints obtain when one considers the one - loop ewsb constraints , _ irrespective _ of model - dependent assumptions .",
    "finally a couple of remarks are in order .    * first , the fact that the second order derivatives are automatically positive when the first order ones are vanishing can of course be also seen from the tree - level mssm relations among the higgs masses . indeed",
    "the well - known relations + @xmath83 + @xmath84 + are such that all squared higgs masses are automatically positive once @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , since + @xmath86 , the positivity of @xmath87 is itself a consequence of eq.([oldcond ] ) , which in turn is implied by the vanishing of the first order derivatives .",
    "it thus follows that the positivity of all the squared higgs masses is at tree - level a consequence of just the stationarity conditions .",
    "* _ sign of @xmath1 _ : for later discussion , let us also recall the reason why @xmath1 can always be chosen positive at tree - level .",
    "as already stated , eq.([soltbeta ] ) implies by itself that the two @xmath1 solutions have the same sign , opposite to that of @xmath63 .",
    "the latter can always be chosen negative in eq.([vtree ] ) by properly choosing the relative phase of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "one can thus replace from the start @xmath63 by @xmath88 in eq.([vtree ] ) and choose all the way long @xmath89 . [",
    "the choice of positive @xmath1 will still be possible beyond tree - level , however in a more tricky way .",
    "indeed , as we will see in the next section , the signs of @xmath1 and the one - loop corrected @xmath63 are no more directly connected through the stationarity conditions ] .",
    "* _ the case @xmath90 _ : whatever the theoretical @xmath1 exclusion domains turn out to be , we would like to stress that the value @xmath90 should be excluded . as can be easily seen from eqs.([dtree1 ] , [ dtree2 ] ) ,",
    "when @xmath91 ( and @xmath92 ) one has necessarily @xmath93 .",
    "this implies that the tree - level potential eq.([vtree ] ) is vanishing everywhere in the neutral direction eq.([neutrdir ] ) so that there is no dynamically preferred electroweak minimum . as we will see in the next section ,",
    "although the degeneracy is lifted by the one - loop corrections , flatness remains in the @xmath91 direction in such a way that the stationary point at @xmath90 is not a minimum .",
    "the natural question to ask , given the results of the previous section , is whether the non - trivial connection between stationarity and local stability just demonstrated , can hold beyond the tree - level .",
    "for one thing , it is obvious that it does in the tree - level - rge improved approximation , where the potential retains its tree - level field dependence , provided that multi - scale subtleties be momentarily evaded by assuming roughly one energy scale , and making the substitutions @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "[ the running of the higgs fields being quite small is usually disregarded . in any case the implicit @xmath96 dependence on the fields is ignored within the approximation , so that one can keep theses fields fixed for the purpose of minimization . ]",
    "potentially new information would come from the study of the non - logarithmic one - loop correction to the effective potential , which we turn to now . here",
    "we stick as before to the @xmath97 directions , and keep as much as possible the discussion at a model - independent level .",

    "@xmath136 + -starting from the analytic solutions for eq.([eqtbeta]),one can exhibit cases , compatible with boundedness from below eq.([ufbloop ] ) , where @xmath1 and @xmath140 _ do _ have the same sign , contrary to what was going on at tree - level . + * @xmath141 and @xmath142 bounds*. as far as eq.([newcond1 ] ) is concerned , the way out resides in eq.([eqv1v2 ] ) together with the requirement that @xmath71 and @xmath70 should have the same sign ; we will show that eq.([eqv1v2 ] ) encodes enough information to imply new lower and upper _ model - independent _ bounds on @xmath1 . [ the automatic validity of eq.([newcond1 ] ) will persist only when @xmath143 .",
    "let us give first a heuristic argument to illustrate how the interplay between eqs.([eqv1v2 ] ) , ( [ newcond1 ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) forbids @xmath144 to be arbitrarily large or small .",

    "one can , however , show analytically that there is no obstruction for @xmath167 to lie within the interval @xmath168 $ ] .",
    "this means that the tree - level connection between stationarity and stability is generally lost , even though it is partially preserved for eq.([newcond1 ] ) , as was stated at the end of the previous paragraph .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath173 .",
    "the proof of this is straightforward , and we will simply exemplify it in fig .",

    "+ the regime @xmath190 is somewhat more tricky .",
    "when @xmath191 one has simultaneously    @xmath192    as can be easily seen from eqs.([ewsbnew ] ) , and the one - loop effective potential comes very close to flat in the @xmath193 region .",

    "we will come back to this point again in the numerical discussion of section 9 . + let us now state some further properties which allow to determine the relative magnitudes of @xmath166 as compared to those of @xmath165 and to @xmath125 .",

    "this means that this solution is a saddle - point rather than a minimum and should thus be excluded .",
    "in this section we comment on the relation between the bounds we derived and some of the features in the existing literature . to start with , it should be clear that the @xmath1 bounds * a ) * and * b ) * reflect but partially the constraints coming from eqs.([ewsbnew ] ) .",
    "this is why @xmath244 and @xmath140 are considered as three free parameters at this level .",
    "this means that the @xmath1 bounds delimit the regions for which a stationary point is an actual ( local ) minimum with non - vanishing vev s . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath1 bounds contain the full information coming from the @xmath6 order derivatives at the one - loop level eqs.([newinv3 ] , [ newcond1 ] ) , ( keeping in mind that we absorbed the logarithmic terms in the tree - level part ) .",
    "they thus imply that the one - loop corrected higgs mass - sum - rules , which have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite , are such that the requirement of positivity of the squared higgs masses leads in general to non trivial constraints . from this point of view",
    ", it is to be noted that if the one - loop minimum remains sufficiently close to its tree - level counterpart , then it is likely that these positivity conditions be automatic as is precisely the case at the tree - level .",
    "this was for instance the case in @xcite where the d - terms in the stop mass matrix where neglected and the renormalization scale chosen such that the stationarity condition be fulfilled at the tree - level .",
    "the leading top - stop effect in the one - loop correction to the lightest cp - even higgs squared mass turned out then to be always positive .",
    "more generally however , keeping those d - terms ( which lead to the @xmath124 contributions ) one should rely on the one - loop stationarity condition , and as can be seen for instance from ref.@xcite the positivity is no more automatic .",
    "conditions * a ) * and * b ) * are the analytic constraints ( within our approximation ) which ensure this positivity .",
    "+ let us now compare briefly some of the well - known constraints , namely @xmath245 , and our condition * a)*. we recall first that @xmath245 is a model - dependent result in the context of sugra - gut @xcite obtained through the running of @xmath246 and @xmath73 as dictated by the theory , in eq.([solv1v2 ] ) .",
    "actually one can easily see from eq.(3.17 ) and what precedes it , that in order to exclude @xmath223 one needs either @xmath247 or @xmath248 .",
    "the first of these inequalities is a sufficient but not necessary condition for electroweak symmetry breaking to take place , so that one also needs to consider the condition @xmath248 in order to exclude @xmath223 in all cases .",
    "this is where , besides the running of @xmath246 and @xmath73 , enters the universality assumption @xmath249 leading to @xmath248 at the electroweak scale . in our case we assume none of the above model - dependent features .",
    "yet , though fully model - independent , our condition @xmath250 appears to be stricter than the previous one since it excludes a calculable domain around @xmath90 .",
    "there is of course no contradiction here ; it only means that using the tree - level ( actually tree - level - rge - improved ) minimization conditions together with some model - dependent assumptions is weaker than just using the model - independent one - loop minimization conditions .",
    "of course , one can still make the same model - dependent assumptions on top of the one - loop minimization conditions we derived and get even stronger bounds .",
    "also our bounds should be contrasted with the more qualitative ones , derived in the literature from the requirement of perturbativity of the higgs - top or higgs - bottom yukawa couplings , @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the requirement of perturbativity is more of practical than physical relevance , while our constraints are directly related to the physical requirement of symmetry breaking .",
    "the constraints and bounds we established in section 4 are necessary for the existence of local minima which break @xmath251 to @xmath252 .",
    "if there exists more than one such minimum , the true minimum will be of course the lowest , or at least a sufficiently metastable one .",
    "however , when it comes to assess the sufficiency of our conditions several other questions should be asked . first , does the symmetric vacuum become unstable as a consequence of the existence of an electroweak vacuum as was the case at tree - level ( see eqs.(3.14 , 3.15 ) ) ?",
    "at vanishing @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the invariants of the matrix of second order derivatives of the one - loop effective potential with respect to the eight components of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , are all equal to @xmath253 which is a direct generalization of the tree - level case , see eqs.(3.14 , 3.15 ) . substituting for @xmath254 and @xmath255 through eq.([ewsbnew ] )",
    "one finds    @xmath256 ( x -   \\frac{x_{m_3}^2}{v_1 v_2})\\ ] ]    upon use of eqs.([newinv3 ] , [ newcond1 ] ) one then shows easily that    @xmath257    thus the one - loop conditions for the existence of ewsb local minima are _ sufficient _ to make the gauge symmetric vacuum unstable .",
    "it should be clear that this is not a self - evident statement",
    ". there would be nothing wrong with a local minimum at the gauge symmetric point , but then one would have had to impose extra constraints for this minimum not to be the global minimum .",
    "up to now all the discussion was lead in the electrically neutral @xmath97 directions defined by eq.([neutrdir ] ) .",
    "charge breaking directions like @xmath258    are usually assumed to be devoid of minima .",
    "indeed , such minima do not occur at tree - level or `` tree - level improved '' approximation in the mssm .",
    "they do however occur in a general two - higgs - doublet model , and imply in this case some constraints on the tree - level higgs couplings @xcite .",
    "furthermore , knowing of no general proof guaranteeing the absence of such minima at higher loop orders even in the mssm , we have to study the one - loop case explicitly .",
    "it is instructive to show briefly what the typical pattern of first and second order derivatives looks like and how it changes when one goes from tree - level to one - loop order .",
    "we will take for illustration the direction defined in eq.([chargdir ] ) , and assume furthermore @xmath259 for simplicity .",
    "we denote the vev s @xmath260 and @xmath261 respectively by @xmath262 and @xmath263 . demanding that @xmath262 and @xmath263 be simultaneously non - vanishing requires @xmath264 and leads to the following stationarity conditions    @xmath265    the above equations are also valid at tree - level , the replacement of @xmath266 by their tree - level counterparts being understood . since @xmath267 is always _ perturbatively _ positive valued , summing eqs.([dcharge1 ] , [ dcharge2 ] ) and taking into account the fact that @xmath268 and @xmath269 are positive , implies readily that @xmath270 .",
    "the last inequality together with @xmath264 violates eq.([ufbloop ] ) and leads to an unbounded from below effective potential .",
    "if one takes the unboundedness from below of the mssm as a disaster then it should be concluded that charge breaking minimum in the higgs sector can not occur in realistic situations .",
    "indeed in sections 3 and 4 we assumed boundedness from below all the way . from this point of view , combining eq.([unstabioneloop ] ) and the absence of charge breaking just illustrated one concludes that _ the necessary ewsb conditions _ derived in those sections _",
    "are also sufficient , at least in the higgs fields directions_. + from a more general point of view , though , one should keep open the possibility that the full theory can still be well behaved even in the case where the mssm has an unbounded from below potential .",
    "after all , the mssm is only a low - energy effective theory while the behaviour of the effective potential at very large field values becomes sensitive to the heavy ( @xmath271 ) degrees of freedom whose interactions might cure the apparent unboundedness from below . in this case",
    "one should study further the second order derivatives to question the occurrence of charge breaking minima .",
    "an important difference shows up between the tree - level and one - loop cases , of which we give here just a glimpse . in both cases",
    "one finds only three independent invariants of the second order derivative matrix . at tree - level ,",
    "two of these invariants have the following form : @xmath272 and are thus always of opposite signs irrespectively of the question of unboundedness from below .",
    "thus at tree - level there is no way of having a ( even local ) charge breaking minimum .",
    "[ note also that @xmath273 would lead through eqs.([dcharge1 ] , [ dcharge2 ] ) to zero charge breaking vev s . ]",
    "+ the situation is more dangerous at one - loop order .",
    "the three invariants read in this case    @xmath274    where @xmath275    and give back , of course , the tree - level results when @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "however one can find now a region , in the perturbative regime , where @xmath278 , @xmath279 , @xmath280 are simultaneously verified and consistent with @xmath281 which is required by eqs.([dcharge1 ] , [ dcharge2 ] ) .",
    "this happens if @xmath282 .",
    "the point is that the perturbative realization of these last inequalities depends on the relative magnitudes of @xmath283 and @xmath284 .",
    "for instance they are not satisfied at the unification scale where one has typically @xmath285 , but they are satisfied at the electroweak scale where @xmath286 .",
    "if anything , this means that , provided the apparent unboundedness from below is tolerated ( see also the related comment at the end of section 8) , local charge breaking minima can occur in the higgs directions of the mssm at the one - loop level ! one would then have to require such minima to remain higher than the electroweak one and to be sufficiently short lived .",
    "we do not dwell further on these aspects here .",
    "+ before closing this section we should note that one has in principle to study the stationarity and stability of the electroweak minimum in all squark / slepton directions as well .",
    "these aspects will be considered elsewhere .",
    "we will be contented here just with the remark that at tree - level the curvature of the effective potential is , on one hand , proportional to the squared squark ( or slepton ) masses in the respective squark ( or slepton ) directions at the zero fields point , and on the other , that this curvature remains positive in these directions also at the electroweak point , for realistic values of @xmath287 and squark / slepton masses .",
    "this does not mean , though , that no charge or color breaking minima can occur , since one can still be driven around a hump into a minimum in a charged or colored direction .",
    "in this section , we make a short digression and discuss briefly the issue of gauge - fixing dependence of the constraints established so far .",
    "it is well - known that the effective potential @xmath3 is generally a gauge - fixing dependent object , even though it is formed of gauge invariant operators .",
    "however , the values of @xmath3 at _ stationary _ points , corresponding to average energy densities of `` vacuum '' states , are themselves gauge - fixing independent at least for a given class of gauges @xcite .",
    "[ this result holds perturbatively in the loop - wise expansion ] .",
    "it follows that the condition @xmath288 selects physical stationary points , even though @xmath289 as well as the field values at which it vanishes ( including the vev s ) , are generically gauge - fixing dependent .",
    "+ we want to point out hereafter that , under fairly general assumptions about @xmath3 , a ( local ) minimum or maximum , remains so for any value of the gauge - fixing parameter , even if the magnitude of @xmath290 is itself gauge - fixing dependent .",
    "+ let us assume that @xmath291 is a smooth continuous function of @xmath292 , where @xmath292 is a generic gauge parameter , and that @xmath3 is bounded from below .",
    "as far as boundedness from below is concerned , one can think of this condition as requiring something like eq.([ufbloop ] ) simultaneously for any value of the @xmath292 parameter .",
    "we can now show that a ( local ) minimum for a given value @xmath293 of the gauge parameter , can not transform into a ( local ) maximum or a saddle - point for another value @xmath294 .",
    "indeed , since @xmath3 is @xmath292-independent at every stationary point @xcite , the only way of changing a ( local ) minimum at a point m , when @xmath293 goes to @xmath294 , is to create a new stationary point m which corresponds to a _ lower _ value of @xmath3 , and which lies between m and the next nearby stationary point . however , this new stationary point ( which exists for @xmath294 and not for @xmath293 ) must be degenerate with one of the already pre - existing stationary points at the value @xmath293 , otherwise it would contradict the @xmath292-independence of @xmath3 at stationary points .",
    "but even if such a degeneracy occurs , @xmath3 being a smooth continuous function of @xmath292 there will always be a value of @xmath292 between @xmath293 and @xmath294 for which a new stationary point appears and is not ( yet ) degenerate with any of the previously existing ones , thus contradicting the aforementioned @xmath292-independence .",
    "this completes the `` proof '' that if @xmath295 at stationary points for a given value of @xmath292 , then it is fulfilled for any value of @xmath292 .",
    "a similar reasoning applies when there are more than one scalar field , and also in the case of ( local ) maxima or saddle - points .",
    "we illustrate in fig.2 a typical behaviour of the effective potential under a gauge - fixing change .",
    "the above discussion shows that the perturbative determination of the conditions for the occurrence of ( local ) minima is physically meaningful , despite the @xmath292-dependence of the quantities we compute ( _ i.e. _ first and second order derivatives ) .",
    "nonetheless , the fact that the vev s are @xmath296 requires some precaution when relating them to the ( physical ) electroweak scale .",
    "for instance , when @xmath297 is equated to @xmath298 to obtain eqs.([ewsbcond ] ) as the condition of symmetry breaking at the correct electroweak scale , one should keep in mind that this is but a gauge - fixing dependent approximation .",
    "the physical mass @xmath299 is the mass pole which is not given ( beyond the tree - level ) by the quantity @xmath300 , the latter being @xmath292-dependent , @xcite .",
    "the one - loop ewsb equations and constraints established in section 4 should be very helpful in the implementation of any radiative symmetry breaking study in the mssm .",
    "they are fully model independent , and must be adapted in each model which triggers electroweak symmetry breaking . in this section",
    "we give a very first illustrative example in a sugra - gut context .",
    "since the aim is just to compare the tree - level and one - loop non - logarithmic contributions , we will take up here , as discussed in section 2 , the simple ( and somewhat old fashioned ) approximation of the renormalization group improved tree - level , without taking into account supersymmetric threshold effects which would not however modify the qualitative picture .",
    "+ we show how the various bounds and constraints presented in section 4 conspire to give , as in the the tree - level case , only one local minimum of the potential .",
    "this should not come as a surprise . at the tree - level ,",
    "the equation for @xmath301 is quadratic and gives at most two real solutions .",
    "actually , we fall in the situation depicted in section 3 , where one solution gives @xmath302 . together with @xmath303 , this solution",
    "is thus rejected for @xmath304 becomes negative .",
    "this situation is common in sugra - gut motivated analyses .",
    "universality for the soft scalar mass terms combined with the relative rapid decrease with the scale of @xmath305 in comparison with @xmath306 ( due to the contribution of @xmath103 in its renormalization group equation ) drives @xmath305 negative while @xmath306 remains positive . by tuning initial values at gut scale , we can arrange to have @xmath307 near electroweak scale .",
    "this is the signal that the gauge - invariant vacuum is unstable , leading to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( we discard here the possibility of ccb minima outside the higgs direction ) . now adding to the tree - level potential one - loop non - logarithmic contributions , the equation for @xmath1 eq .",
    "( 4.13 ) becomes quartic .",
    "so we can potentially have up to four different and real solutions in this case .",

    "although the vev s vary rapidly near the `` critical scale '' ( where @xmath325 stops to exist ) , they still remain finite . below this scale the vev s",
    "become complex valued , and disappear in fig.5 .",
    "+ regarding the mild behaviour of the vev in comparison with the tree - level one , we can say that adding non - logarithmic terms to the tree - level potential , even before including logarithmic ones , already contributes to stabilize the vev of the higgs fields .",
    "* remarks on unboundedness from below * one might inquire whether it is physically relevant to consider , as we did in the previous paragraph , the regions of the parameter space where the effective potential is unbounded from below . considering the mssm as a low - energy approximation of a more fundamental theory which would set in at high energy ( presumably @xmath349 )",
    ", one should keep in mind that our effective potential is also `` effective '' in the sense that only light degrees of freedom are taken into account .",
    "the fact that we consider regions where equation ( [ ufbloop ] ) is violated means that we implicitly assume the heavy degrees of freedom of the full theory to play an important role in lifting the effective potential at very large values ( @xmath350)of the scalar fields and restore a bounded from below potential . in this case",
    ", the relevant question one can ask from a model - independent point of view is whether local minima exist even when @xmath3 is a decreasing , and negative valued function at large field values , and whether any of these minima can be lower than the value of @xmath3 for fields just below the scale where the full theory should set in .",
    "we have demonstrated in this paper , the existence of fully _ model - independent _ constraints involving @xmath1 and the other free parameters of the mssm .",
    "these constraints are derived from a careful study of the ewsb conditions , including the finite ( non - logarithmic ) one - loop corrections to the effective potential .",
    "we have shown with this respect that stationarity and stability conditions ( which are necessary and sufficient to ensure the existence of a local minimum ) are not automatically related beyond the tree - level approximation .",
    "we then determined the exact analytic forms of both and deduced new bounds on @xmath1 .",
    "these bounds are , generally speaking , resemblant to the existing ones , but they turn out to be more restrictive even though fully model - independent ! they also distinguish quite naturally the `` large '' and `` low '' @xmath144 regimes , restricting further the allowed range within each of these regimes .",
    "+ as a first step , we resorted in this paper to the approximation where the logarithmic contributions are taken into account through the rg - improved tree - level potential .",
    "this , we believe , contains already many of the qualitative features of the problem at hand .",
    "the inclusion of the logarithmic effects beyond the present approximation will be presented elsewhere .",
    "finally , it is clear that the existence of model - independent constraints is interesting both theoretically and phenomenologically .",
    "for instance we noted that the connection between stability and stationarity , which is lost beyond the tree - level , can be partially preserved if @xmath351 .",
    "if this connection is a desirable theoretical criterion then the model - independent study helps select the model assumptions likely to satisfy it .",
    "more down to earth , given the variety of theoretical models and the fact that recent data seem to favour some of the mssm parameter values that are not consistent with the conventional model assumptions @xcite , the model - independent constraints would help narrow down the domains that should be common features to all models",
    ". in particular our constraints to one - loop order are readily applicable in the context of r - parity violation , and can be generalized to the next to minimal mssm .",
    "we would like to thank nikolai krasnikov for asking the question which lead to section 7 .",
    "we also acknowledge useful discussions with michel capdequi - peryranere , abdelhak djouadi and jean - loc kneur .    [ [ section ] ]",
    "starting from eq . ( [ eqv1v2 ] ) , @xmath352 with @xmath121 , @xmath353 and @xmath354 and assuming boundedness from below eq ( [ ufbloop ] ) , we note first that the two zeros of @xmath355 , i.e.    @xmath356    have the same sign , _ opposite to that of @xmath140 _",
    ". furthermore one has @xmath357 the degenerate value @xmath207 being attained when the inequality eq.([ufbloop ] ) is saturated . on the other hand , we note that @xmath358 as easily seen from eqs.([alpha ] ) and ( 4.9 ) and from the usual relations @xmath359 .",
    "we keep here absolute values on purpose ( and somewhat puristically ) , since we would like to establish clearly the freedom in choosing the sign of @xmath1 , which is rather tricky in the present context .    in the following",
    "we will address the question of whether the necessary stability condition @xmath141 ( eq.([newcond1 ] ) ) is automatically fulfilled , and will establish in the process some model - independent analytic bounds on the allowed values of @xmath1 .",
    "the properties of @xmath165 presented above , and the sign of @xmath124 will be crucial for the subsequent discussion .    regarding eq.([signalpha ] )",

    "both regions are actually not excluded by the stationarity condition eq.([eqv1v2p ] ) alone , and one has to make explicit reference to the stability condition eq.([newcond1 ] ) . strictly speaking",
    ", one should still ask whether the remaining stability condition eq.([eqtbeta ] ) can guarantee @xmath141 .",
    "we have actually exhibited numerical examples where it does not .",
    "thus in this case , the `` tree - level logic '' _ does not go over to the one - loop level_.    now if we compare the two cases of eqs.([sup1 ] ) and eqs.([inf1 ] ) , we see that no information is lost if one fixes the sign of @xmath140 from the start ( by redefining , when needed , the phase of one of the two higgs fields in eq.([vloop ] ) ) .",
    "we still insist however , that this choice is tricky , since , in any case , eq.([eqtbeta ] ) is likely to give @xmath1 solutions with opposite signs ( in contrast with the tree - level case where the two solutions had the same sign , see eq.([soltbeta ] ) ) .",
    "it would then be erroneous to choose invariably the positive @xmath1 solutions .",
    "rather , one should keep a handle on the actual sign of @xmath140 ( corresponding to a given set of values of the mssm parameters ) and choose the @xmath1 solution which satisfies eq.([newcond1 ] ) .",
    "once the right solution is determined , one is at liberty to redefine its sign and accordingly that of @xmath140 . in practice ,",
