    "it is well known how to generalize the definition of the @xmath0-state potts model to @xmath0 real by turning to a loop / cluster formulation , and the related six - vertex model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the square lattice , the ferromagnetic potts model thus defined exhibits reasonably well understood critical properties . in many respects ,",
    "it can be considered as the `` lattice equivalent '' of the dotsenko - fateev twisted bosonic theory , and thus , has served as a benchmark for our understanding of numerous issues in conformal field theory and integrable systems .",
    "the antiferromagnetic case is much less understood .",
    "this is not too surprising , as antiferromagnetic models often exhibit frustration , and thus more complex phase diagrams .",
    "while the physical interest of this model per se is probably limited to a few special values of @xmath0 , it turns out that the difficulties encountered in its study are very similar to those encountered in the study of models with supergroup symmetries .",
    "these models are believed to play a crucial role in the description of critical points in non - interacting disordered systems .",
    "strong similarities with the @xmath12 spin chain relevant to the spin quantum hall effect @xcite in particular motivated us to tackle the long overdue continuation of a first work on the topic by one of us in 1991 @xcite . in this paper , we are finally able to present a conjecture , supported by a long list of arguments and partial calculations , for the conformal field theory describing the critical antiferromagnetic potts model on the square lattice for @xmath13 $ ] . in a nutshell , this theory involves two bosons : a compact boson not unlike the one appearing in the description of the ferromagnetic critical point , _ plus _ a non - compact boson . to our knowledge , this is the second time only that a non - compact boson is encountered in a statistical mechanics model with a finite number of degrees of freedom per site , the first time being the super goldstone phases of @xcite .",
    "the appearance of such bosons is generic in the study of conformal field theories based on supergroups .",
    "another major peculiarity of the antiferromagnetic transition  and of the neighboring `` berker - kadanoff '' phase  is the profound role played by the quantum group symmmetry , and the related differences between the potts model and the vertex model for @xmath0 generic , as well as the difference between the case @xmath0 generic and @xmath0 a beraha number [ i.e. , @xmath3 with @xmath4 integer ] for the potts model .",
    "finally , the last peculiarity of the antiferromagnetic transition is that it is , for @xmath0 generic , a first - order critical point , that is a point where correlations are algebraic but at the same time the derivatives of the free energy are discontinuous .",
    "this feature was initially observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the particular case of the @xmath14 limit .",
    "obviously this quick summmary of our conclusions requires much elaboration , and careful distinction between incarnations of the model which are usually considered `` equivalent '' . for easy reference",
    ", we review in section 2 key aspects of the various representations of the potts model",
    ". we also comment on the importance of boundary conditions and on the definition of the transfer matrices in the various representations .",
    "further background material is given in the main text , and details can also be found in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we shall start in section 3 by the simplest problem , which is the properties of the ( mostly untwisted ) vertex model associated with the potts model on the antiferromagnetic critical line .    in section 4 ,",
    "we proceed to discuss the properties of the twisted vertex model , as well as those of the loop model and thus the @xmath0-state potts model for @xmath0 generic .    in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss the related incarnation of rsos models for @xmath0 a beraha number .",
    "we show how their continuum limit is given by a @xmath15 parafermion theory , and use this in particular to complete the identification of the continuum limit of the antiferromagnetic potts model in section 6 .",
    "another subtlety in this problem is the parity of the number of sites ( potts spins ) in the transfer matrix .",
    "while most of the paper discusses the case @xmath16 even , interesting things also happen at @xmath16 odd , making the picture richer ( the non - compact boson acquires a twist ) .",
    "this is discussed in section 7 .",
    "section 8 goes back to physics , with the discussion of the magnetic exponent and the extremely delicate case of the thermal exponent .",
    "we discuss there also the issue of the first - order critical point , and the flow from parafermionic to minimal theories  la fateev - zamolodchikov .",
    "section 9 contains conclusions as well as prospects for ( much ) future work .",
    "the appendix meanwhile discusses the limit @xmath17 further , in particular how the @xmath18 matrix for blocks of four vertices in the staggered vertex model case reduces to the @xmath19 @xmath18 matrix in this limit .",
    "the @xmath0-state potts model is defined initially in terms of integer - valued spins @xmath20 living at the lattice vertices @xmath21 , and interacting through nearest neighbour coupling , with the partition function z = _",
    "ij e^k ( _ i,_j ) .",
    "[ zspin ] here @xmath22 is the coupling constant and @xmath23 denotes the lattice edges",
    ". we shall refer to this as the _ potts spin representation_.    the low - temperature expansion of eq .",
    "( [ zspin ] ) gives the _ cluster representation _",
    "@xcite for which z = _ e ij q^c(e ) ( e^k-1)^|e| , [ zcluster ] where @xmath24 is the number of clusters ( connected components ) in the edge subset @xmath25 .",
    "the equivalence between the potts spin representation and the cluster representation holds true with any boundary conditions . note that now one can decide to give the variable @xmath0 any arbitrary real value , hence extending the definition of the potts model to @xmath0 non - integer .    instead of the clusters ,",
    "one may count the number of loops @xmath26 of the cluster boundaries which live on the medial , or surrounding , lattice ( here another square lattice oriented diagonally with respect to the initial one ) . using the euler relation",
    "one obtains the _ loop representation _ @xcite z = q^s/2 _ e ij q^l(e)/2+(e ) ( ) ^|e| [ zloop ] where @xmath27 is the number of lattice vertices .",
    "the function @xmath28 , except on a torus if there is a cluster in @xmath25 that wraps around _ both _ periodic directions @xcite ; in the latter case @xmath29 . with this slight topological subtlety ,",
    "one obtains a loop representation of the potts model for @xmath0 arbitrary , totally equivalent to the cluster representation . formulas ( [ zcluster ] ) and ( [ zloop ] ) _ define _ the model we want to study , and for which we want to determine the phase boundaries , and critical properties .",
    "a key feature of the @xmath0-state potts model for @xmath0 arbitrary is that it has a non - local definition . while this is not a problem for applications ( e.g. , the study of percolation , trees , forests , etc . ) , it makes the analytical and numerical studies , or the construction of associated conformal field theories , particularly tricky .",
    "let us see this more explicitly",
    ". we will be mostly interested in the case of the square lattice , which we will often consider as being built up by a _ transfer matrix _ acting along the `` time '' ( @xmath9 ) direction ( of length @xmath30 lattice spacings ) , the perpendicular direction being referred to as the `` space '' ( @xmath31 ) direction ( of width @xmath16 lattice spacings ) .",
    "we then have @xmath32 .",
    "we consider for definiteness the case in which the transfer matrix propagates along propagates diagonally with respect to the spin lattice ( i.e. , axially with respect to the medial lattice ) .",
    "[ fntm1 ] ] the spin lattice ( i.e. , diagonally with respect to the medial lattice ) , and we let the width of the @xmath31-direction be @xmath16 potts spins , central charges @xmath33 , and physical scaling dimensions @xmath34 are labelled by the width @xmath16 in terms of potts spins . when the transfer direction is diagonal with respect to the spin lattice , we use the label @xmath35 , meaning that the projected width is @xmath36 lattice spacings in terms of the spin lattice .",
    "[ fntm2 ] ] .",
    "the basis states for the transfer matrix in the potts spin representation , valid for @xmath0 integer , are of course @xmath16 variables @xmath20 , whence @xmath37 . in the cluster representation , basis states are set partitions of @xmath16 elements respecting planarity , whence @xmath38 with @xmath39 being catalan numbers . for @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 .",
    "excited sectors are constructed by restricting to set partitions with @xmath42 components , of which exactly @xmath43 are marked . by definition , the marked components can not join among themselves under the action by @xmath44 .    in the loop representation ,",
    "basis states are complete pairings of @xmath45 points respecting planarity , with again @xmath38 .",
    "excited sectors are constructed by replacing @xmath43 of the pairings with exactly @xmath46 marked loop segments that can not close among themselves .",
    "the crucial point is now that the partition functions ( [ zcluster ] ) or ( [ zloop ] ) can not be written as traces of the transfer matrix raised to the power @xmath30 because of the non - locality .",
    "this is of course expected , the cluster or loop transfer matrices having different dimension ( and thus different sets of eigenvalues ) than the potts spin transfer matrix for @xmath0 integer .",
    "instead , the partition functions are written via more complicated `` functionals '' of the cluster or loop transfer matrices , alllowing in particular for the disappearance of many eigenvalues ( corresponding to `` non - local '' information ) for @xmath0 integer .",
    "for instance , with boundary conditions which are free in the @xmath31-direction and periodic in the @xmath9-direction , the loop / cluster partition function is given by @xmath47 for suitably initial and final vectors ( and in fact with a modified transfer matrix defined in terms of connectivities among _ two _ time - slices ) @xcite .",
    "the end result is that z_m=_n_0=0^n ( 2n_0 + 1)_q _ k ( ^(n_0)_k)^m[zexample ] , where @xmath48 is the set of eigenvalues of the foregoing transfer matrix , corresponding to the sector with @xmath43 marked components defined above .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath49 are @xmath50-deformed numbers and are derived from quantum group considerations @xcite , while we have set @xmath51 .",
    "the essential point is that the amplitudes in ( [ zexample ] ) can vanish when @xmath0 is integer .",
    "in fact , setting @xmath52 , they can vanish whenever @xmath9 is rational .",
    "a remarkable feature of the potts model around the antiferromagnetic transition is that the disappearing eigenvalues can be the leading ones , giving rise to strong singularities in the thermodynamic properties .",
    "in contrast , in the ferromagnetic region , the disappearing eigenvalues correspond only to excited states , and lead merely to the disappearance of some non - local observables from the spectrum of excitations .    to summarize",
    ", the lesson so far is that _ for @xmath50 a root of unity , not all eigenvalues of the cluster or loop transfer matrix do contribute to the potts partition function_. the same would of course be true in the doubly free , or doubly periodic case .",
    "it would now seem crucial to remove the non - local aspect of the weights in the loop / cluster representation . to this end",
    ", we again consider the case of free boundary conditions in the @xmath31-direction and periodic in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "for all loops which are homotopic to a point , assigning independently an orientation to each loop and giving a weight @xmath53 to a loop that turns through an angle @xmath54 to the left then reproduces @xcite the full loop weight of @xmath55 upon setting @xmath56 . as for the non - contractible loops , they would acquire instead a weight @xmath57 in this formulation , but this can be corrected by assigning the weight @xmath50 ( resp .",
    "@xmath58 ) to any oriented loop that passes through the periodic boundary condition .",
    "summing over the oriented loop splittings of vertices which are compatible with given edge orientations finally gives a representation in terms of the six - vertex model @xcite .",
    "this model again lives on the medial lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of the corresponding ( xxz ) spin chain can be extracted by taking the anisotropic limit , and is useful for studying the model with the bethe ansatz technique .",
    "note that the vertex model is in general staggered , as the weight assigned to a given vertex depends on whether this vertex stands on a direct or a dual edge of the original spin lattice .",
    "also , in the case of boundary conditions which are free in the @xmath31-direction and periodic in the @xmath9-direction , the vertex model has special weights for the vertices at the surface , corresponding to boundary fields in the xxz formulation",
    ". we shall refer to it as a `` twisted '' vertex model . an untwisted version",
    "would be obtained by setting the boundary fields to zero .",
    "unlike for the cluster or loop transfer matrix , the transfer matrix of the vertex model is a local object .",
    "basis states are orientations of @xmath45 arrows , with an equal number of ups and downs , whence @xmath59 .",
    "excited sectors are constructed by having instead @xmath60 ups and @xmath61 downs .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath31-direction are imposed by giving a special weight ( twist ) to the first arrow in each row . but",
    "again , the correspondence with the potts model implies that the object of interest is not the trace of the transfer matrix raised to the power @xmath30 , but some functional of it . in the simplest case of free boundary conditions in the @xmath31-direction and periodic in the @xmath9-direction , adjusting",
    "the weight of non - contractible loops leads to the expression @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the conserved spin ( arrow flux ) along the transfer direction .",
    "the commutation of the vertex transfer matrix with the quantum group @xmath64 leads to a more compact expression of @xmath65 in terms of @xmath50-dimensions , with the same features of disappearing eigenvalues when @xmath50 is a root of unity .",
    "so we get the same lesson that for @xmath50 a root of unity , not all eigenvalues of the twisted vertex model transfer matrix do contribute to the potts partition function .",
    "the same would of course be true in the doubly free , or doubly periodic case .",
    "obviously the phenomenon of disappearing eigenvalues requires great care in handling the results from transfer matrix analysis .    to complete this introduction",
    "we must now discuss briefly the doubly periodic case .",
    "the correspondence between the models is then more complicated .",
    "consider for instance the loop representation and its vertex model reformulation .",
    "the weight @xmath55 for non - contractible loops can only be reproduced , after orientation , by giving a special weight that depends on the winding of the loop in both periodic directions ; this weight , in turn , transforms into a complex combination of weighed sectors for the vertex model obtained after summing over loop splittings ! on top of this , the sector with no non - contractible loops must also be singled out because of the extra @xmath66 factor in ( [ zloop ] ) !",
    "this is discussed in details in the literature @xcite , and will be addressed below . for",
    "now , we need to consider only what happens in the vertex model when the non - contractible loops wind in only one direction . we have already seen what to do when they wind in the @xmath9-direction : their weight must be adjusted from @xmath57 to @xmath55 by introducing a modified trace term . similarly , when they wind in the @xmath31-direction",
    ", one must introduce a twist term assigning the weight @xmath50 ( resp .",
    "@xmath58 ) to any oriented loop passing through the @xmath31-periodic boundary condition . this leads , in the xxz limit , to a modified coupling between the first and the last @xmath64 spins , and defines what we call the _ twisted vertex model or spin chain transfer matrix_. this is mostly an intermediate object for us : while we consider the potts partition function or the untwisted vertex model partition function in this paper , we do not enter the discussion of what would be the proper definition of the twisted vertex model partition function .",
    "going beyond the simple case of loops which are non - contractible in the @xmath31-direction is a very technical topic @xcite ( best handled in the framework of temperley - lieb and periodic temperley - lieb algebras ) which we will address when necessary in the following . suffice it to say that _ for generic @xmath50 , the eigenvalues of the cluster or loop transfer matrix are a subset of the eigenvalues of the vertex model transfer matrix for various twist sectors_.",
    "the antiferromagnetic critical line for the square - lattice potts model ( defined , for @xmath0 generic , using the loop / cluster formulation ) was identified by baxter @xcite as @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the usual horizontal and vertical couplings .",
    "it is as always convenient to introduce the variables @xmath69 and set @xmath70 where @xmath71 , with @xmath72 $ ] , and @xmath73 is a spectral parameter .",
    "the antiferromagnetic line then corresponds to @xmath74 the potts model on the line ( [ antiferro ] ) is never selfdual .",
    "selfduality would correspond instead to @xmath75 , that is @xmath76 .",
    "the potts model is generally related to a six - vertex model with quantum group symmetry obtained from the loop formulation by putting arrows on the medial lattice ( see section 2 , and ref .",
    "@xcite for further review ) , and using the spectral parameters @xmath77 to define the vertex @xmath18 matrix on the two sublattices . in general , this vertex model is not solvable .",
    "the peculiarity of the antiferromagnetic line is that the vertex model  and hence the potts model , at least in principle  becomes solvable because , when @xmath78 , it can be considered as a particular case of models exhibiting `` @xmath79 invariance '' @xcite . in general ,",
    "such models are obtained by associating a spectral parameter @xmath80 with every horizontal line ( with label @xmath21 ) , a spectral parameter @xmath81 with every vertical line , such that the @xmath18 matrix at the vertex @xmath82 is @xmath83 . on the antiferromagnetic line ,",
    "the @xmath81 are alternatingly @xmath84 , while the @xmath80 are alternatingly @xmath85 .",
    "thanks to the special shift @xmath86 , and the fact that @xmath73 can be identified with @xmath87 , there are indeed only two types of vertices for the resulting vertex model , with interactions given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively ( see the appendix for more details ) .",
    "the isotropic case ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) would correspond to @xmath92 .",
    "while vertex models with imaginary heterogeneities of the spectral parameter have been studied in some detail @xcite , the situation of a real heterogeneity does not seem to have attracted much attention .",
    "we will now see how the vertex model exhibits truly remarkable properties .",
    "we consider a transfer matrix propagating in the vertical direction .",
    "the basic equations can be obtained using standard techniques ",
    "they appeared intially in the pioneering paper by baxter @xcite . instead of @xmath93 on the right - hand side , as confirmed by the analysis of the analytic bethe ansatz , eq .",
    "( 5.4 ) of that same paper . ]",
    "we will use modern quantum inverse scattering notations , following @xcite .",
    "we introduce the kernel @xmath94 together with the source terms @xmath95 and @xmath96 recall that the parameter @xmath97 is related to @xmath0 by @xmath71 , with @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "the bethe equations read then symbolically , for a system of @xmath45 vertical lines ( this corresponds to @xmath16 potts spins ) , @xmath99 here , we have introduced an adjustable phase @xmath100 corresponding to twisted boundary conditions .",
    "the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix has a complicated expression , but in the limit of @xmath16 large to which we will restrict , it reduces to @xmath101 rather than the vertex model transfer matrix , we will consider the hamiltonian , obtained in the strongly anisotropic limit @xmath102 .",
    "its eigenvalues read @xmath103    \\label{energi}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a ( positive ) constant to be chosen below .",
    "a remarkable property of these bethe equations is that they , like the energy , are invariant under a global shift of the roots @xmath104 .",
    "this is due to the peculiar form of the heterogeneities ; in general , the invariance is only under @xmath105 .",
    "equivalently , one can think of this as invariance under @xmath106 .",
    "states for which the root configuration is invariant under @xmath107 will correspond to non - degenerate eigenvalues , while states which are not correspond to eigenvalues degenerate twice .",
    "writing the contribution of the roots to the energy more explicitly as @xmath108 we can conjecture that the ground state is obtained ( at least when the phase @xmath109 ) by filling the lines @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the source terms are of a new type then , which we will denote @xmath112 .",
    "the fourier transform ( with conventions @xmath113 ) is @xmath114 the other kernels to consider are @xmath115 and @xmath116 , with fourier transforms @xmath117 the minus sign in the source term leads to a ground state where rapidities are a decreasing function of the bethe integers , and we get , in the continuum version @xmath118&=&-(\\dot{q_{1}}+\\dot{q}_{-1})-\\dot{\\phi}_{11 }    \\star\\rho_{1}-    \\dot{\\phi}_{1,-1}\\star\\rho_{-1}\\nonumber\\\\    2\\pi[\\rho_{-1}+\\rho_{-1}^{h}]&=&-\\dot{q_{1}}+\\dot{q}_{-1})-\\dot{\\phi}_{-1,1 }    \\star\\rho_{1}-    \\dot{\\phi}_{-1,-1}\\star\\rho_{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solving these equations gives the densities in the ground state .",
    "it is most useful to go one step further and write `` physical equations '' where on the right - hand side appear holes in the ground state distributions , that is densities of excitations over the physical vacuum : @xmath119 the kernels here are defined by their fourier transforms @xmath120 the function @xmath121 , @xmath122 . from this",
    "the ground state densities first follow , @xmath123 .",
    "the ground state energy per vertex is then @xmath124 it is interesting to compare this result with baxter s expressions for the free energy @xcite .",
    "using analyticity techniques , he finds that the free energy per site can be written as @xmath125 where the function @xmath126 ( denoted by @xmath127 in his work ) is given in eqs .",
    "( 30a)(30d ) of @xcite . to compare with our hamiltonian we need to let @xmath73 approach @xmath128 from below , and take a derivative , so we must consider the expression @xmath129&= &    \\frac{d}{du}\\left[-\\int dk{\\sinh^{2}(\\gamma k)\\sinh ( 2uk)\\over k         \\sinh(\\pi k)\\sinh(\\pi-2\\gamma)k}+      \\int dk{\\sinh(\\gamma k)\\sinh(\\pi-\\gamma)k\\sinh ( 2uk)\\over k\\sinh(\\pi ki )        \\sinh(\\pi-2\\gamma)k}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\    & = &    2\\int dk { \\sinh ( \\gamma k)\\over \\sinh(\\pi       k/2)\\cosh(\\pi-2\\gamma)k/2}\\label{ffirstdomain}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this agrees with our ground state energy , given in ( [ energgs ] ) , and constitutes an interesting check of our equations .",
    "the `` physical '' bethe equations immediately show that there are two branches of massless excitations ( at least ) obtained by making holes in the ground state at @xmath130 on the lines @xmath131 and @xmath111 .",
    "this is _ twice _ the usual result for the xxz chain , and leads one to expect that the central charge will be equal to two , a result we will confirm below .",
    "the rapidity of the excitations ( such that @xmath132 ) is @xmath133 .",
    "as for the energy , one has @xmath134\\ ] ] so relativistic invariance requires @xmath135 .",
    "the kernels @xmath136 describe a complex scattering theory , which we do not yet entirely understand .",
    "a crucial fact is that these kernels diverge at small @xmath137 , a very unusual feature , that is also encountered in the studies of models based on super algebras @xcite .",
    "we will argue below that it implies the existence of a continuum component of the spectrum .",
    "one can however observe some drastic simplifications for `` symmmetric excitations '' , i.e. , excitations which are identical for the two lines @xmath138 and @xmath111 .",
    "for these , the `` effective kernel '' is obtained as @xmath139 , @xmath140 this is the soliton - soliton kernel for the sine - gordon model regime with @xmath141 .",
    "this observation has a simple origin .",
    "consider again the bethe equations : it is clear that there is a particular type of solutions obtained when the real parts of the roots on @xmath110 and @xmath142 coincide .",
    "the equations for these real parts are then of the form @xmath143 while the energy reads @xmath144 comparing with the results for the xxz chain ( with relativistically invariant normalization ) @xmath145 \\label{xxz}\\ ] ] we see from standard works on this topic @xcite that this spectrum will lead to _ twice _ the central charge and critical exponents of the xxz chain ( [ xxz ] ) with parameter @xmath146 . on the other hand",
    "it is known that the conformal field theory limit of this xxz chain is a free boson with coupling constant @xmath147 ( in agreement with the value @xmath141 obtained before for the scattering matrix ) .",
    "notice in particular that the limit @xmath148 corresponds to @xmath149 , i.e. , the xxx chain .",
    "in other words , there has to be a whole class of excitations in our system for which the gaps will be the same as the gaps of this xxz chain ( [ xxz ] ) , _ up to a factor two _ ( this should hold with or without twist angle @xmath100 ) .",
    "we call this ` the xxz subset ' of our spectrum .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that it corresponds exactly to the configurations of roots which are invariant under the extra @xmath150 symmetry @xmath151 .",
    "of course , there has to be many more excitations , since doubling the spectrum of the xxz chain creates many gaps in the conformal towers .",
    "these excitations should appear with an extra degeneracy of two , since they corresponds to configurations of roots which are not symmetric .",
    "we can make further progress on this question by analyzing in more details the finite - size spectrum from the bethe ansatz .",
    "for this , we go back to the physical bethe equations involving holes in the distributions of strings and antistrings .",
    "it is interesting to determine the dressed charges of the excitations .",
    "normally , this is an easy task .",
    "write the bare equations as @xmath152 .",
    "it follows that @xmath153 , where @xmath154 .",
    "standard formulae then exist to express the gaps in terms of the matrix @xmath155 @xcite : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the two - column vector @xmath158 , and @xmath159 the change of solutions of the @xmath160 type .",
    "similarly , @xmath161 is the two - column vector @xmath162 , and @xmath163 the number of solutions of the @xmath160 type backscattered from the left to the right of the fermi sea . in ( [ hbarh ] ) , @xmath9 denotes transposition .",
    "here however we encounter a major snag : the matrix @xmath155 has all its elements infinite , as the kernels diverge when @xmath164 .",
    "we have taken the most naive approach possible , and assumed that the standard formulas still made sense in this case , after maybe some regularization .",
    "it turns out that such regularization is easy : just keep @xmath137 small but non - zero in the matrix elements .",
    "one can then calculate the inverse of @xmath155 , and let @xmath164 in the end .",
    "one finds @xmath165 and thus @xmath166 we recover here the xxz subset ( see later ) for @xmath167 . on top of this",
    "however , we have a continuum of soft modes corresponding to @xmath168 .",
    "this is similar to observations in @xcite and @xcite where the soft modes were interpreted as arising from a non - compact boson .",
    "we therefore believe that the continuum limit of the untwisted vertex model is described by a compact boson ( called @xmath169 in what follows ) with @xmath170 _ plus _ a non - compact boson ( called @xmath171 ) giving a continuum of soft modes on top of the gaps for the first boson .    while the action of the twist angle @xmath100 on @xmath169 ( that is , the xxz subset of the spectrum ) is well understood , the action on @xmath171 seems to be more subtle , and",
    "can not be captured by our simple analysis .",
    "we shall see that even the parity of @xmath16 affects @xmath171 in a non - trivial way .",
    "the bethe equations expressed in terms of roots at @xmath172 look like equations for a rank two algebra , and suggest the existence of two @xmath173 conserved quantities , that is , an extra quantity on top of the spin @xmath174 .",

    "it is important to notice that this free boson is in fact exactly the same as the one describing the xxz subset on the antiferromagnetic critical line .",
    "the first step in going from the vertex model to the loop / cluster representation of the potts model is to introduce a twist in the vertex model .",
    "we have explained that this twist has a convenient geometrical interpretation if one decomposes the vertex configurations in loops : without it , loops which are non - contractible around the cylinder get a weight @xmath57 , instead of the required @xmath224 for the loop representation of the potts model .",

    "we will use the name diagonal and axial in reference to the medial lattice ( see also footnotes  [ fntm1][fntm2 ] ) .",
    "notice that for @xmath9 an integer ( and only then ) , the eigenvalue associated with @xmath234 is also thrown away because it is a descendent from the sector with no twist and spin @xmath239 , as illlustrated in fig .",
    "this is the mechanism that , in the periodic case , produces the singularities of the bk phase at the beraha numbers @xmath240 , with @xmath9 integer .",
    "it is the equivalent of the slightly simpler mechanism studied in @xcite in the case of open boundary conditions .",

    "hence what one calls an exponent of the loop / vertex model has to be defined with great care",

    "hence one should have expected the level corresponding to ( [ twiscen ] ) to be truncated when going from the vertex to the loop / cluster formulation , and the central charge of the potts model to be given by another value .",
    "what happens is the following .",
    "observe that the xxz subset of the spectrum ( in the scaling limit ) on the antiferromagnetic critical line coincides with the spectrum ( in the scaling limit ) in the bk phase , with or without twist angle ( and up to an additional contribution of one to the central charge ) .",
    "since , because of the doubling effect discussed previously , the vertex model on the antiferromagnetic critical line has _ more _ scaling gaps than in the bk phase , it means that some of the levels which were at finite distance from the ground state in the bk phase have to cross and become scaling levels on the antiferromagnetic critical line .",

    "since the latter eigenvalue is also observed ( as a `` descendent eigenvalue '' ) in the vertex model in the sector with @xmath208 and twist angle @xmath248 ( giving to non - contractible loops the weight @xmath224 ) , it follows that the latter sector has a ground state degenerate at least _",

    "of course , the correspondence between the partition function of the rsos model , the partition function of the potts model , and the spectrum of the loop / cluster transfer matrix or twisted vertex model transfer matrix is rich and intricate .",

    "where , in the abf phase diagram , these models stand is an interesting question .",
    "for @xmath73 in regimes @xmath284 or @xmath285 , the abf model is at the transition point between its regime @xmath286 and regime @xmath287 ( capital letters refer to the regimes originally defined in @xcite ) , while for @xmath73 in regimes @xmath283 , the abf model stands at the transition point between its regime @xmath288 and regime @xmath289 . based on this observation , we see that we ought to expect that the antiferromagnetic potts model , for a given value of @xmath0 , can be in two different universality classes , depending on the anisotropy .",
    "the isotropic case is what we are interested in here : @xmath90 corresponds to the sdp ( self - dual potts ) models in regimes @xmath283 and thus the abf models at the transition between regime @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",

    "it is therefore tempting to conjecture that _ the rsos version of the antiferromagnetic critical line for @xmath295 an integer is in the universality class of the abf models at the transition between regime i and regime ii , and thus , following @xcite is a theory of @xmath15 parafermions .",

    "this in turn can be interpreted within the coulomb gas by assuming that one of the two bosons sees antiperiodic boundary conditions in the space direction .",
    "the determination of the watermelon exponents ( see below ) gives the values @xmath356 showing that the contribution from the boson @xmath169 is as in the @xmath16 even case , and thus it must be the non - compact boson @xmath171 that is twisted , i.e. , sees antiperiodic boundary conditions .    notice that if the field @xmath171 is twisted in the @xmath16 odd sector , the continuous part of the spectrum must disappear , as the twisted sector of a compact and non - compact bosons are identical .",

    "the effective central charge is found numerically ( see fig .  [ num17 ] ) to be given by a field of dimension @xmath357 to interpret the presence of the weight ( [ observ ] ) in general , we observe that it can be written @xmath358 as argued earlier , the @xmath359 contribution comes from an antiperiodic sector for the non - compact boson @xmath171 .",

    "we expect this feature to extend to @xmath9 generic , and this is indeed well verified by the numerics for the first excitations in the odd-@xmath16 sector , both for the loop model and for the twisted vertex model .",

    "is left for future work : it seems clear in any case that the variable @xmath22 is not very natural to study the perturbations of the untwisted theory .",
    "a last observation we can make is that , since the parafermionic theories for @xmath9 integer flow to minimal theories in the bk phase , and since the latter are derived from a coulomb gas with coupling @xmath405 , it is most likely that excitations for @xmath0 generic around the `` false ground state''i.e .",
    ", the state that crosses from the higk @xmath22 phase , and that would still be the ground state of the potts model for @xmath0 a beraha number  are described by this coulomb gas , at least in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic transition .",
    "excitations around the true ground state meanwhile are described by a coulomb gas with @xmath223 , so both manifolds are in fact present within the bk phase !",
    "the least one can say is that the properties of the antiferromagnetic potts model are extremely complex , even for the simple case of the square lattice .",
    "there are definitely loose ends in our study , the most important one being probably our lack of understanding of the emergence of a non - compact bosonic degree of freedom",
    ". one might understand it at a very qualitative level by considering the block interactions as in fig .",
    "[ block ] . summing the arrows on either of the pairs of incoming or outgoing legs defines dual height variables which are described by the boson @xmath169 .",
    "the states for which the two arrows have opposite directions do not change the height @xmath169 , and draw loops on the lattice , which can intersect at vertices .",
    "these loops bear _ some _ resemblance to the loops of the goldstone phases in @xmath406 models , for which it is known that the continuum limit is essentially a collection of non - compact bosons and symplectic fermions .",
    "it is thus not so far fetched to expect that the loops in the antiferromagnetic potts model are described by a non - compact boson , which would mean roughly that they are brownian at large scales .",
    "it would of course be most interesting to elaborate this picture further .    a more straightforward direction of study would be to consider , when @xmath9 is rational , the rsos versions on the antiferromagnetic critical line .",
    "since when @xmath320 is an integer , they are in the universality class of @xmath15 parafermions , identical with the @xmath407 coset model , it is tempting to speculate that they might be related to @xmath408 with a rational level .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the appearance of a line of first - order critical points is intriguing .",
    "such points are not entirely unheard of . in early works , they were exhibited for instance in the one - dimensional @xmath50-state classical clock model with a topological term @xcite .",
    "another case which is related is the point @xmath409 in the high - temperature loop version of the low - tempeature ising model ( i.e. , the @xmath410 dense loop model @xcite ) .",
    "recall indeed that the low - temperature ising model is a massive theory as far as the local spin degrees of freedom are concerned , but nevertheless presents interesting conformal properties when one reformulates it as a high - temperature loop expansion .",
    "these properties are the same as the ones of the dense @xmath410 loop model , and are described by a conformal field theory with vanishing central charge , and , more importantly , a field of vanishing dimension  the spin operator .",
    "turning on a magnetic field leads to a first - order singularity of the free energy , that is , the model is also at a first - order transition point where the two manifolds of possible spontaneous magnetization @xmath411 intersect . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear how to see the difference between positive and negative magnetic fields within the loop formulation , since the field is conjugate to the number of loop end points , and that number is necessarily even .",
    "therefore , it is not clear how to actually observe for instance the first - order singularity of the free energy .",
    "interestingly , first - order critical points have also been independently proposed in a series of papers by pruisken and collaborators revisiting the quantum hall effect transition .",
    "these authors have argued for instance @xcite that in the large-@xmath16 @xmath412 model , there are bulk massless degrees of freedom at the first - order phase transition point . if true , these massless degrees of freedom could maybe be understood in the @xmath0-state potts model incarnation as geometrical degrees of freedom , probably non - local in terms of the original potts spins .",
    "finally , the reader might wonder whether the antiferromagnetic transition discussed here is particular to the square lattice .",
    "we believe on the contrary that it is common to any two - dimensional lattice .",
    "indeed , it is well established that the properties along the ferromagnetic transition line are universal , for example by invoking the standard one - boson coulomb gas construction .",
    "the existence of another line of transitions for which the thermal operator is irrelevant ( which we have called , for the square lattice , the non - physical selfdual line ) follows by analytic continuation in the coulomb gas coupling constant , and leads immediately to the existence of a berker - kadanoff phase , in the region where @xmath413 . to isolate this phase from the trivial fixed points at zero and infinite temperature , we need ( at least ) on either side a further line of repulsive fixed points .",
    "these lines must necessarily be the loci of level crossings , and it is thus not far fetched to expect that the rest of the physics of the first - order critical points ( at generic @xmath0 ) will follow .",
    "moreover , the singularities at the beraha numbers follow from the fact that the vertex model transfer matrix can be built in terms of temperley - lieb generators and that this commutes with the generators of the quantum group , two very universal ingredients .    to test this heuristic argument ,",
    "let us consider the case of the triangular lattice .",
    "setting @xmath414 , the potts model is integrable when @xmath415 @xcite .",

    "<S> we solve in this paper the problem of the antiferromagnetic transition for the @xmath0-state potts model ( defined geometrically for @xmath0 generic using the loop / cluster expansion ) on the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this solution is based on the detailed analysis of the bethe ansatz equations ( which involve staggered source terms of the type `` real '' and `` anti - string '' ) and on extensive numerical diagonalization of transfer matrices . </S>",
    "<S> it involves subtle distinctions between the loop / cluster version of the model , and the associated rsos and ( twisted ) vertex models . </S>",
    "<S> the essential result is that the twisted vertex model on the transition line has a continuum limit described by two bosons , one which is compact and twisted , and the other which is not , with a total central charge @xmath1 , for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - compact boson contributes a continuum component to the spectrum of critical exponents . for @xmath0 generic </S>",
    "<S> , these properties are shared by the potts model . for @xmath0 a beraha number , i.e. , @xmath3 with @xmath4 integer , and in particular @xmath0 integer </S>",
    "<S> , the continuum limit is given by a `` truncation '' of the two boson theory , and coincides essentially with the critical point of parafermions @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the vertex model , and , for @xmath0 generic , the potts model , exhibit a first - order critical point on the transition line  that is , the antiferromagnetic critical point is not only a point where correlations decay algebraically , but is also the locus of level crossings where the derivatives of the free energy are discontinuous . in that sense , </S>",
    "<S> the thermal exponent of the potts model is generically equal to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> things are however profoundly different for @xmath0 a beraha number . in this case , the antiferromagnetic transition is second order , with the thermal exponent determined by the dimension of the @xmath7 parafermion , @xmath8 . as one enters the adjacant `` berker - kadanoff '' phase , the model flows , for @xmath9 odd , to a minimal model of cft with central charge @xmath10 , while for @xmath9 even it becomes massive . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a physical realization of a flow conjectured long ago by fateev and zamolodchikov in the context of @xmath11 integrable perturbations .    finally , though the bulk of the paper concentrates on the square - lattice model , we present arguments and numerical evidence that the antiferromagnetic transition occurs as well on other two - dimensional lattices .    # </S>",
