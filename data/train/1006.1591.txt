    "understanding the formation history and chemical evolution of the galactic globular clusters has always been a formidable , but fundamental , task .",
    "however , this task has become even more challenging with the recent discovery of complex stellar populations within individual globular clusters .",
    "the most well - known example is @xmath0  cen ( anderson 1997 ; bedin et al .",
    "2004 ; ferraro et al .",
    "2004 ) , but the same phenomenon has also been discovered in other massive globular clusters , including ngc  2808 ( dantona et al .  2005 ; piotto et al .",
    "2007 ) , ngc  1851 ( milone et al .  2008 ; han et al .  2009 ) , ngc  6715 ( m54 ; layden & sarajedini 2000 ; siegel et al .  2007 ) , and ngc  104 ( 47  tuc ; anderson et al .",
    "2009 ) . in @xmath0  cen ,",
    "accurate photometry demonstrates that its main sequence ( ms ) population is split into multiple sequences , with the bluest ms stars being more metal rich , implying that the corresponding sub - population is perhaps enhanced in helium ( @xmath1 ; piotto et al .",
    "such helium - rich stars may have formed in a second stellar generation from the helium - rich ejecta of the initial stellar generation that formed the cluster ( e.g. , see renzini 2008 ) .",
    "possible candidates for producing these ejecta include asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) stars , massive ms stars , type ii supernovae , and even stars external to the cluster ( bekki & norris 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "these clusters thus refute the long - standing premise that globular clusters are simple stellar populations .",
    "the discovery of complex populations in globular clusters has understandably generated much excitement , especially in regard to the morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) . because the ms turnoff ( msto ) mass decreases strongly with increasing helium at a fixed cluster age , a high helium abundance will lead to a bluer hb morphology for a given range in the red - giant branch ( rgb ) mass loss , and this , in turn , might account for the long blue hb tails found in some clusters ( dantona et al .",
    "2002 ; busso et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the extreme hb ( ehb ) stars , located at the hot end of the hb at temperatures @xmath2 and surface gravities log  @xmath3 , would be the progeny of the most helium - rich ms stars .",
    "the hottest ehb stars have extremely thin envelope masses ( @xmath4 ) , due to extensive mass loss on the rgb .",
    "the analogs of the ehb stars in the field are the subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars .",
    "both unresolved spectroscopy and resolved imaging have demonstrated that ehb stars are the dominant contributors to the `` uv upturn '' in the otherwise cool spectra of elliptical galaxies ( brown et al .",
    "1997 ; brown et al .",
    "2000 ; brown et al .",
    "2008 ) .    uv observations of globular clusters have revealed yet another puzzling result , namely , that two of the massive clusters with evidence for a helium - rich ms population ( @xmath0 cen and ngc  2808 ) also contain an unexpected population of subluminous ehb stars that can not be explained by canonical stellar evolution theory .",
    "these subluminous stars were first discovered in @xmath0  cen ( dcruz et al .  1996 , 2000 ) , where they form a `` blue hook '' ( bh ) feature at the hot end of the canonical ehb .",
    "dcruz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) proposed that such stars may have undergone a delayed helium - core flash after peeling away from the rgb due to high mass loss .",
    "we now know that stars can follow a variety of evolutionary paths to the hb , depending on when the helium - core flash occurs ( see figure 1 ) . for normal rates of mass loss",
    ", the helium - core flash will occur at the tip of the rgb ( rgb tip flasher , figure 1a ) .",
    "however , for sufficiently high rates of mass loss , the helium - core flash can occur either during the crossing of the hr diagram ( early hot flasher , figure 1b ) or on the white dwarf ( wd ) cooling curve ( late hot flasher , figure 1c ) , as first shown by castellani & castellani ( 1993 ) .",
    "brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter paper i ) demonstrated that a delayed helium - core flash on the wd cooling curve would result in a stellar atmosphere extremely enhanced in helium ( @xmath596% by mass ) and carbon ( @xmath54% by mass ) , due to the mixing of the stellar envelope into the hot helium - burning core .",
    "this `` flash mixing '' decreases the opacity below the lyman limit , thereby lowering the flux at longer wavelengths , and increases the effective temperature in the ehb stars . in paper",
    "i , we found that both of these effects together might explain the bh feature in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of ngc  2808 .",
    "evidence for bh populations in other clusters soon followed , including ngc  6715 ( rosenberg et al .  2004 ) , ngc  6388 ( busso et al .",
    "2007 ) , ngc  2419 ( ripepi et al .  2007 ) , and ngc  6273 ( noted by rosenberg et al .",
    "2004 , but originally appearing in piotto et al .",
    "ngc  6441 may host bh stars , although the case has been unclear ( busso et al .  2007 ; dieball et al .",
    "2009 ) .    to extend the investigations enabled by uv observations of @xmath0 cen and ngc  2808",
    ", we have obtained far - uv and near - uv images of those additional clusters with the strongest evidence for bh populations : ngc  2419 , ngc  6273 ( m19 ) , ngc  6715 ( m54 ) , ngc  6388 , and ngc  6441 .",
    "a characterization of bh populations in globular clusters can only be performed definitively with an ultraviolet cmd , where , due to the small bolometric correction , the photometric effects of enhanced helium and carbon abundances can be distinguished from changes in temperature .",
    "these clusters span a wide range of metallicity ( @xmath6  [ fe / h ]  @xmath7 ) , which enables an exploration of how the bh population is distributed in temperature , luminosity , and size , relative to the canonical ehb population , as a function of cluster environment and metallicity .    to avoid confusion , it is worth clarifying our terminology .",
    "bh stars were first defined observationally as being hotter and fainter than the hot end of the canonical ehb .",
    "however , we will show in this paper that some clusters host stars fainter than the canonical ehb , but with somewhat redder colors .",
    "these red colors may imply temperatures down to @xmath515,000k .",
    "the stars appear distinct from the still redder blue straggler sequence ( bss ) , and they appear to be associated with the bluer bh stars .",
    "we will also consider these to be bh stars , without necessarily implying that they have the same physical origin .    in this paper",
    ", we compare our uv cmds of five massive globular clusters , together with the previous uv cmd of ngc  2808 , to the expectations from canonical evolution theory and flash - mixing . in each case",
    ", we explore the expectations for stars born at standard cluster abundances and for stars born with enhanced helium abundances .",
    "to ensure a consistent exploration of these scenarios , our evolutionary models are tailored to the appropriate abundance profiles , as are the model atmospheres and synthetic spectra employed to transform from the theoretical plane to the observable plane .",
    "the six clusters discussed herein have all been imaged in the far - uv and near - uv using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. due to variations in the instrumentation available for each observation , the bandpasses were not identical for each cluster ( see figure 2 ) , but the effective wavelengths in each wavelength region ( far - uv or near - uv ) are similar , easing comparison of cmds constructed from these bandpasses . in table 1 , we summarize the observations for each cluster .",
    "we also include ngc  2808 , the subject of paper i , observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) ; each stis uv channel has pixels of @xmath8 arcsec and a field of view of @xmath9 arcsec .    lcccc cluster & & + & bandpass & exposure ( s ) & bandpass & exposure ( s ) + ngc2419 & acs / sbc / f150lp & 5180 & acs / hrc / f250w & 5080 + ngc6273 & acs / sbc / f150lp & 1980 & wfpc2/wf3/f255w & 11000 + ngc6715 & acs / sbc / f150lp & 1980 & wfpc2/wf3/f255w & 11000 + ngc2808 & stis / fuv / f25qtz & 8916 & stis / nuv / f25cn270 & 8906 + ngc6388 & acs / sbc / f150lp & 1980 & wfpc2/wf3/f255w & 11000 + ngc6441 & acs / sbc / f150lp & 4680 & wfpc2/wf3/f255w & 11000 +    as originally proposed , the observations in the current program intended to use the solar blind channel ( sbc ) and high resolution channel ( hrc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on _ hst _ , with the sbc f150lp filter providing the far - uv bandpass and the hrc f250w filter providing the near - uv bandpass .",
    "the acs / sbc has pixels of @xmath10 arcsec and a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath11 arcsec , while the acs / hrc has pixels of @xmath12 arcsec and a fov of @xmath13 arcsec .",
    "due to its larger distance and smaller angular size , the observations of ngc  2419 were planned with a single tile imaged with the sbc and hrc , while the remaining four clusters were planned with a @xmath14 mosaic of tiles in each bandpass . due to guide star problems and instrument failures ,",
    "the program did not proceed according to plan .    in december 2006 , the first observations of ngc  2419 were attempted .",
    "the hrc exposures were obtained in two consecutive orbits , with no problems .",
    "the sbc exposures were obtained in the subsequent two orbits , but with serious problems .",
    "the guide star re - acquisition failed in the first sbc orbit , setting the take data flag down and resulting in two blank images . in the final orbit ,",
    "the re - acquisition of guide stars was successful , but due to a flight software bug , the telescope did not complete the maneuvers needed to point at the correct field . as a consequence ,",
    "the next two exposures were not blank but offset by nearly an arcmin from the successful hrc images .",
    "this flight software bug , which was apparently unique to the _ hst _ two - gyro mode in the situation where successful guide star acquisitions followed guide star failures in the same visit , has since been fixed .",
    "the sbc exposures for ngc  2419 were eventually obtained a year later . in short , ngc  2419",
    "was observed with the intended acs / sbc / f150lp and acs / hrc / f250w bandpasses , after some difficulties .    due to a failure of an acs power supply in january 2007",
    ", the hrc channel stopped working . at that time , only the near - uv ( hrc ) images of ngc  2419 had been taken , so the near - uv images of the remaining four clusters were obtained with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , using the f255w filter and the wf3 chip .",
    "the wf3 chip has @xmath15 arcsec pixels and a fov of @xmath16 arcsec .",
    "the near - uv channel on wfpc2 is not as sensitive as that on the acs / hrc , but the larger field of view allowed imaging of the intended area in a single pointing instead of the @xmath14 mosaic of hrc images .",
    "thus , ngc  6273 , ngc  6388 , ngc  6441 , and ngc  6715 were observed with the acs / sbc / f150lp and wfpc2/f255w bandpasses .",
    "due to these distinctions , the observations of ngc  2419 and the remaining four clusters were processed somewhat differently .",
    "for ngc  2419 , the images in each channel were registered and drizzled to a common scale of 0.@xmath17025 , while for the other four clusters , the scale was 0.@xmath170455 .",
    "the acs / sbc images were combined using the drizzle package ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) , but required no cosmic - ray rejection because the sbc is a photon - counting multianode microchannel array ( mama ) .",
    "the wfpc2 and acs / hrc detectors are ccds , so images from these detectors were combined with masking of cosmic rays .",
    "because globular clusters are much sparser in the uv than in the optical , we did not perform photometry using fitting of the point spread function . instead , we performed aperture photometry in each channel with an aperture correction to an infinite aperture , using the standard aperture corrections for these instruments ( heyer et al .  2004 ; maybhate et al .  2010 ; sirianni et al .",
    "for the four clusters observed with the acs / sbc and wfpc2 , the apertures were 2.5 pixels and 5 pixels , respectively ; for the cluster observed with the acs / sbc and acs / hrc ( ngc  2419 ) , the apertures were 2.5 pixels and 1.5 pixels , respectively . because it is a mama , the sbc requires no correction for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , but the near - uv photometry was corrected for cti using the corrections of dolphin ( 2000 ) and chiaberge et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , for the wfpc2 and acs / hrc , respectively .",
    "the cmd for each cluster is shown in figure 3 . in figure 4 , we highlight one of these clusters ( ngc  6715 ) to provide a guide to the various classes of stars discussed in this paper : blue hb ( bhb ) stars , ehb stars , bh stars , bss , and the agb - manqu@xmath18 ( agbm ) progeny of the ehb stars . note that we chose ngc  6715 not because it is particularly representative of massive clusters but because each class of star is well - populated in this cmd .",
    "each cluster exhibits a distinct hook feature at the blue end of its hb locus .",
    "as discussed extensively in paper i , this hook feature can not be due to photometric scatter , differential reddening , or instrumental effects , because these mechanisms could not affect the photometry of the ehb without also affecting the photometry of the neighboring bhb stars , which are only slightly redder ; the ehb and bhb stars have similar far - uv luminosity and photometric errors . despite the similar photometric errors in the ehb and bhb stars , the ehb locus spans a luminosity range that is several times larger than that on the hot end of the bhb .    .",
    "the stellar evolutionary models used in the present study were computed with a procedure similar to the one described in paper i. for each cluster , we constructed grids of evolutionary sequences that followed the evolution of appropriate low - mass stars continuously from the zero - age ms through the end of the hb phase for two values of the initial helium abundance : a helium - normal abundance @xmath19 of 0.23 , representing the helium abundance in stars born during the first stellar generation with standard cluster abundances , and a helium - rich abundance @xmath19 of 0.40 , representing a reasonable upper limit on the helium enhancement in the second stellar generation born after a process of cluster self - enrichment .",
    "the hotter hb sequences in these grids were also evolved through the post - hb phases .",
    "the heavy element abundance @xmath20 for these sequences was determined from the observed [ fe / h ] value for each cluster , assuming an @xmath21-element enhancement of [ @xmath21/fe ]  =  0.3 , as appropriate for metal - poor globular cluster stars ( carney 1996 ) . using the prescription given by salaris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for converting an @xmath21-enhanced abundance into an equivalent scaled - solar abundance , we obtained scaled - solar heavy element abundances @xmath20 of 0.00023 , 0.00064 , 0.00081 , 0.0015 , 0.0077 , and 0.0090 , respectively , for the six clusters ngc  2419 , ngc  6273 , ngc  6715 , ngc  2808 , ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "we used the same @xmath20 value to compute both the helium - normal and helium - rich sequences for each cluster .",
    "the initial main sequence mass for each composition ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) was calculated for an age of 13 gyr at the tip of the rgb , although ages a few gyr younger would have little qualitative effect on the subsequent evolutionary behavior .",
    "the sequences for each composition ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) differ from each other only in the amount of mass loss along the rgb , which we parameterize with the reimers ( 1975 , 1977 ) mass - loss formulation :    @xmath22  ( @xmath23 yr@xmath24 ) ,    where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the stellar luminosity , gravity , and radius , respectively , in solar units , and @xmath28 is the well - known reimers mass - loss parameter . because our calculations follow the evolution through the helium - core flash , we are able to determine how the evolutionary path from the ms to the zahb depends on the assumed mass - loss rate ( see figure 1 ) . the red end of the zahb is set by the sequence with @xmath28 = 0.0 ( no mass loss ) . up to a given value of @xmath28 ( @xmath50.7 for intermediate [ fe / h ] values ) ,",
    "the models remain tightly bound to the rgb until the helium - core flash ( figure 1a ) .",
    "however , for higher values of @xmath28 , the models leave the rgb and evolve to high effective temperatures before igniting helium ( castellani & castellani 1993 ) , either during the crossing of the cmd ( figure 1b ) or while descending the wd cooling curve ( figure 1c ) .",
    "dcruz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that such `` hot flashers '' might provide another channel for populating the ehb .",
    "although the masses of the late hot flashers for each composition ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) fall within a narrow range , they are produced over a rather wide range in the mass loss rate ( @xmath29  @xmath50.1 ) .",
    "extremely fine tuning of the mass - loss rate is thus not required to produce a late hot flasher ( see paper i ) . for sufficiently high values of @xmath28",
    ", the models simply cross the hr diagram and descend the wd cooling curve without igniting helium , thus dying as helium wds ( see figure 1d ) .    the rgb tip flashers and early hot flashers ignite helium at a time when the models are very luminous .",
    "the strong hydrogen - burning shell in these models forms a high entropy barrier that prevents the flash convection from penetrating into the envelope , and hence no mixing then occurs between the envelope and the core .",
    "thus any star that undergoes the helium - core flash before reaching the wd cooling curve will arrive on the zahb via canonical evolution ( i.e. , with a normal atmospheric composition ) . in contrast , stars that ignite helium on the wd cooling curve have much weaker hydrogen - burning shells and thus much lower entropy barriers ( sweigart 1997 ; paper i ) . under these conditions ,",
    "penetration of the flash convection into the envelope becomes inevitable .",
    "this flash mixing will mix hydrogen - rich material from the envelope into the core and helium- and carbon - rich material from the core into the envelope , thereby greatly enhancing the surface helium and carbon abundances .",
    "a similar process may produce other extremely hydrogen - poor stars ( also known as `` born again '' stars ) during a very late helium-_shell _ flash ( renzini 1990 ) .    due to the numerical difficulties associated with this mixing process ( paper i )",
    ", we terminated our sequences as soon as they encountered flash mixing .",
    "nevertheless , we can still predict the surface composition that these flash - mixed models should have when they arrive on the zahb .",
    "the available calculations clearly indicate that flash mixing will consume most , if not all , of the envelope hydrogen .",
    "thus we expect the surface composition of the flash - mixed models to be strongly depleted in hydrogen and enriched in helium",
    ". the surface carbon abundance should also be close to its value in the flash convection zone , namely , 4% by mass .",
    "for these reasons the flash - mixed models given in this paper will assume that the surface carbon abundance has been increased to 4% by mass and that all of the remaining surface hydrogen has been burned to helium .",
    "it is worth noting that cassisi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and miller bertolami et al .",
    "( 2008 ) were able to follow the flash mixing process in detail , and their values for the flash - mixed surface composition are in good agreement with the composition adopted here . note also that some of the carbon may be burned to nitrogen during the flash mixing , depending on the details of the nucleosynthesis ; such an outcome would not have a significant effect on the stellar evolution models .      in order to produce theoretical spectra for the evolutionary tracks",

    "the physical motivation for this assumption comes from the fact that the bolometric luminosities of all hb stars in the range @xmath40  k are increased by nearly the same amount when @xmath19 is enhanced , and that the effect on the uv - to - optical color in the emergent spectrum is minimal .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , our choice of extinction is equivalent to aligning canonical bhb models of intermediate @xmath19 ( @xmath50.3 ) to the observed bhb locus .    in figure 3 , we show the cmd of each cluster compared to the expected locus for stars in the core helium - burning stage , assuming standard cluster metallicity and helium abundance .",

    "thus the cluster parameters we derived in fitting the bhbs of these clusters to the canonical @xmath33 locus should also apply to the red hb stars . in the case of the two metal - rich clusters ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , it is well known that the hb slopes upward ( rich et al .  1997 ; busso et al .",
    "2007 ) , with the @xmath45-band luminosity of the bhb being @xmath50.5  mag brighter than that of the red hb clump .",

    "thus our parameters for these two clusters should also apply to their red hb clumps . if the bhb should be dominated by stars with @xmath34 and the red hb by stars with @xmath33 , one would therefore predict a luminosity difference between the bhb and red hb clump that is much larger than observed in any of our six clusters . to avoid this contradiction",
    ", one might argue alternatively that the red hb stars are themselves helium - rich , but this would imply a much brighter red hb luminosity and hence a much younger ( and untenable ) cluster age from the observed luminosity difference between the red hb and the msto ( e.g. , see mart@xmath61n - franch et al .",
    "as one example , catelan et al .  ( 2006 ) have compared the cmds of ngc  6388 and 47  tuc and concluded that both of these clusters have similarly old ages .    in short , while the @xmath34 locus exhibits a sharp drop in luminosity between the bhb and ehb , these models can not by themselves explain the bh phenomenon .",
    "given the lack of helium enhancement on the red hb and the relative luminosities of the bhb and red hb , we can not align models of arbitrarily high @xmath19 to the bhb without violating other observational constraints . if we assume the bhb has a standard helium abundance ( @xmath33 , in the case of the four metal - poor clusters ) or an intermediate helium abundance ( @xmath60 , in the case of the two metal - rich clusters ) , then even a wide range of helium abundance ( @xmath62 ) on the ehb would not explain either the faint luminosities or the wide color range observed in the bh stars .",
    "we next consider models which undergo flash mixing due to high mass loss on the rgb . in figure 7 , we plot these flash - mixed models in our uv cmds , assuming the same reddening and distance values obtained in section 4.1 .",
    "those values align a canonical @xmath33 locus to the bhb in the four metal - poor clusters , but place this @xmath33 locus 0.5  mag fainter ( in @xmath37 ) than the bhb in the two metal - rich clusters . for each cluster in figure 7",
    "we show the hb evolutionary tracks for three representative flash - mixed models ; two of these tracks fall at the extremes of the range in the mass loss rate leading to flash mixing , as measured by the value of @xmath28 , while one falls halfway between these extremes .",
    "we plot these triplets of flash - mixed tracks for both @xmath33 and @xmath34 in order to bracket the range of behavior expected from any sub - population in the cluster that undergoes enough mass loss for flash mixing .",
    "all of the flash - mixed tracks for each cluster fall within a narrow temperature range .",
    "the offset in luminosity among these tracks is due to small differences in the helium - core mass .    as can be seen in figure 7",
    ", flash - mixed models can reproduce the faint luminosities observed in the bh population , particularly the flash - mixed models originating in a subpopulation with enhanced helium .",
    "flash mixing thus offers a way of reproducing the faint luminosities observed in the bh stars without causing problems at the bhb or red hb clump , as discussed in the last section .",
    "furthermore , the flash - mixed models , when combined with the canonical hb locus , are better able to reproduce the large luminosity width observed at the hot end of the ehb .",
    "there is one obvious problem , however , which was also seen in the previous sections ; like canonical models , flash - mixed models ( whether originating in a population with enhanced or standard @xmath19 ) can not reproduce the red colors in the bh population .",
    "paper i explored various ways of producing such red bh stars , including enhanced line blanketing in the atmosphere , due to an increase in the atmospheric fe abundance via radiative diffusion . in the case of ngc  2808 , an increase in the [ fe / h ] from @xmath63 to @xmath64",
    "could shift the bh stars @xmath50.3  mag to the red .",
    "however , this color shift is not enough to explain the full color range of the bh population .",
    "furthermore , the effect would be even smaller for the metal - rich clusters , which are the very clusters exhibiting the reddest bh stars . because the metal - rich clusters already incur significant line blanketing , increasing the [ fe / h ] via diffusion does not help much ; for example , increasing the [ fe / h ] in ngc  6388 from @xmath65 to @xmath66 only shifts the bh color redward by 0.26  mag . thus",
    ", at this time , the mechanism for producing subluminous hb stars with such red colors remains a puzzle , and it suggests that the formation mechanism for these stars is not yet fully understood .",
    "in this paper , we have compared the uv cmds of six massive globular clusters with the expectations from stellar evolution theory .",
    "we find that in each of these clusters , the hottest hb stars are subluminous with respect to canonical models , whether or not those models assume a standard helium abundance ( @xmath33 ) or an enhanced helium abundance ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation is that all of these clusters host bh stars .",
    "however , in the two metal - rich clusters , the subluminous stars either extend to relatively red colors ( ngc  6388 ) or are restricted to these red colors ( ngc  6441 ) , which might imply that an additional or distinct phenomenon is at work at high metallicity .",
    "indeed , the existence of bh stars in ngc  6441 has been questioned ( e.g. , dieball et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the bh population of ngc  6388 may be the link between the bh populations in the metal - poor clusters and that in ngc  6441 , because it spans the full color range observed in these clusters .",
    "the bluest stars in the ngc  6388 bh population appear to be analogs of the bh stars in the metal - poor clusters , while the reddest stars in the ngc  6388 bh population appear to be analogs of the bh stars in the ngc  6441 population .",
    "moreover , the entire bh population in ngc  6388 appears to be contiguous .    in some massive clusters ,",
    "all of the ehb stars may have originated in a sub - population with enhanced helium .",
    "for example , in ngc  2808 , nearly all of the ehb stars falling within the @xmath33 canonical locus ( figure 6 ; _ pink shaded region _ ) also fall within the @xmath34 canonical locus ( figure 6 ; _ green shaded region _ ) ; such stars are normal in the sense that they are not flash - mixed .",
    "however , there is a dearth of stars falling in the brighter part of the @xmath33 ehb locus , which may indicate that the dominant @xmath33 population in this cluster only produced bhb and red hb stars . in ngc  2419 ,",
    "the situation is even more extreme .",
    "few ehb stars fall in either the @xmath33 or @xmath34 canonical loci , and thus all of the ehb stars in this cluster may have been produced via flash - mixing ( see figure 7 ) . as with ngc  2808 , the dominant @xmath33 population in ngc  2419",
    "may only have produced bhb and red hb stars .",
    "the faint luminosities observed in the bh stars can be reproduced by models that undergo flash mixing during a late helium - core flash on the wd cooling curve .",
    "helium enhancements may also play an important role in the formation of bh stars , primarily because a higher helium abundance lowers the msto mass at a given age so that less mass loss is required on the rgb to populate the hot hb .",
    "helium enhancements also depress the luminosity somewhat in canonical ehb models , but not by the @xmath51  mag of the faintest bh stars .",
    "several recent studies have argued against flash mixing as the origin of the bh stars .",
    "for example , lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) attribute the bh stars to the evolution of a population with a high initial helium abundance ( @xmath34 ) . however , as we demonstrate in  4.2 , an enhancement in @xmath19 can not by itself explain the bh phenomenon .",
    "while an enhanced @xmath19 decreases the ehb luminosity and increases the bhb luminosity ( thus providing a hook at the hot end of the hb ) , one can not arbitrarily adjust the cluster reddening and distance to match the theoretical hb locus to an observed cmd without regard to the relation between the bhb , the red hb , and the msto .",
    "furthermore , the models of lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) do not predict any carbon enhancement in the bh stars , while optical spectra of bh stars in @xmath0 cen and ngc  2808 do suggest such an enhancement may be present ( moehler et al .",

    "dantona et al .  (",
    "2010 ) go further , postulating that ms stars born at @xmath67 could undergo deep mixing on the rgb that elevates their helium abundance to @xmath68 before arrival on the ehb . the mechanism that drives this deep mixing is unclear , unlike the mechanism for flash mixing that follows from the basic stellar structure equations and which is the inevitable outcome of a helium - core flash on the wd cooling curve .",
    "however , the effect of the dantona et al .",
    "( 2010 ) `` rgb mixing '' is to generate ehb stars with very high helium abundances that are hotter than the canonical hb , and in this way their models are similar to those produced by flash mixing .",
    "an important distinction , however , is that their rgb mixing precedes the helium - core flash , and thus does not produce an enhancement in the carbon abundance .",
    "castellani et al .  (",
    "2006 ) have argued that canonical hb models can reach the high @xmath31 observed for bh stars , but their ehb stars reach a maximum @xmath31 of @xmath532,000  k. this is much less than that found by moehler et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2007 ) for the bh stars ( @xmath6935,000  k ) , and much less than the temperatures reached by either flash mixing or rgb mixing models .",

    "2004 , 2007 ) .    in paper ii",
    ", we found that a delayed helium - core flash could sometimes lead to a more shallow form of flash mixing , where the envelope hydrogen is only mixed into the outer layers of the core .",
    "when this happens , flash - mixed stars can retain some residual envelope hydrogen , and consequently would be distributed closer to the canonical ehb .",
    "our models imply that shallow mixing may be a relatively rare occurrence , especially at low metallicities .",
    "our cmds do not show any systematic variation in the number of bh stars falling close to the canonical locus , suggesting that shallow mixing is not important in the metallicity range covered by our clusters .",
    "it may be , however , that we simply do not have enough bh stars to detect such a trend . with the current sample",
    ", it appears that the bh stars in each cluster fall up to @xmath51  mag below the canonical hb , regardless of metallicity .",
    "the sdb and sdo stars of the galactic field are the analogs of the ehb and post - ehb stars found in clusters .",
    "one would expect some of these stars to also show evidence of flash mixing .",
    "this expectation motivated far - uv spectroscopy of helium - rich sdb stars in the galactic field using the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ , to see if these stars exhibit the helium and carbon abundance enhancements expected from flash mixing .",
    "those observations do in fact lend support to the flash mixing scenario .",
    "the spectrum of pg1544 + 488 ( archetype of the he - sdb class ) shows incredibly strong carbon lines , indicating a surface that is @xmath70% carbon by mass ( paper ii ) .",
    "further insight into the nature of the bh stars may come from upcoming far - uv spectroscopy of ngc  2808 . in the current observing cycle , we will use the space telescope imaging spectrograph on _ hst _ to obtain spectra of bh stars , normal ehb stars , and bhb stars selected from the ngc  2808 cmd ( figure 5 ) . with these spectra , we will be able to search for the atmospheric signatures of flash mixing ( e.g. , enhanced carbon , diminished h ) and perhaps shed light on the origin of the wide color range exhibited in bh stars .",
    "our understanding of the bh phenomenon is far from complete .",
    "none of the models discussed in this paper ( canonical at standard @xmath19 , canonical at enhanced @xmath19 , or flash - mixed ) are able to explain the red colors found in some or all of the subluminous stars in each cluster .",

    "furthermore , the near - total lack of normal ehb stars in half of our clusters is puzzling .",

    "the dearth of such stars may imply a gap in one or more cluster parameters , but the mechanism for such a gap is unclear .",
    "a remarkable feature of all clusters either known or suspected to host bh stars is that they are among the most massive clusters in the galaxy .",
    "dieball et al .  (",

    "this is a difficult test , given the small number of clusters in their comparison .",

    "( 2009 ) with a mass of 0.32@xmath7110@xmath72  @xmath23 . for ngc  6752 ( landsman et al .",
    "1996 ) and ngc  2808 ( paper i ) , there exist cmds that include a far - uv bandpass . in the case of ngc  6752",
    ", the cmd is sampling a less massive cluster outside of the core , while in the case of ngc  2808 , the cmd is sampling a more massive cluster within the core . despite these distinctions , the samples of ehb stars and their descendents are comparable in size . in each cmd , there are @xmath580 hb stars hotter than 16000  k , along with four post - ehb stars ",
    "i.e. , the shorter - lived agbm stars . however , for the case of ngc  2808 , 46 of the ehb stars are bh stars ( lying well below the canonical ehb ) , while in ngc  6752 , none of them are .",
    "given that the size of the ehb samples are approximately the same , the number of bh stars in the two clusters are discrepant at a high statistical significance .",
    "this argument is not restricted to ngc  6752 ; other low - mass clusters , such as m13 and m80 ( ferraro et al .",
    "1998 ) host dozens of ehb stars but apparently few if any bh stars ( m13 may host 2 bh stars ; sandquist et al .  2010 ) .",
    "the large numbers of ehb stars in both the low - mass cluster sample and the high - mass cluster sample provide strong support for the notion that the fraction of ehb stars that are subluminous ( i.e. , bh stars ) is nearly zero in low - mass clusters and @xmath550100% in high - mass clusters .",
    "there are several possible reasons why bh stars may only appear in massive globular clusters .",
    "one possibility is that only massive clusters can retain the helium - rich ejecta from their first generation of stars .",
    "besides this helium enrichment , such self - pollution might account for many of the abundance variations in o , na , mg and al observed in ms and rgb stars ( see gratton et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that massive clusters have many close binaries , which produce the high mass loss needed for flash mixing . of the massive clusters known to host bh stars ,",
    "none are core - collapsed , and all are of intermediate central concentration ( harris 1996 ) , so that one might expect a significant fraction of surviving binaries ( ivanova et al .",
    "however , the lack of a radial gradient in the ngc  2808 bh population argues against a binary origin ( bedin et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "support for proposal 10815 is provided by nasa through a grant from stsci , which is operated by aura , inc .",

    "<S> blue hook stars are a class of hot ( approximately 35,000  k ) subluminous horizontal branch stars that occupy a region of the hr diagram that is unexplained by canonical stellar evolution theory . by coupling new stellar evolution models to appropriate non - lte synthetic spectra , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate various theoretical explanations for these stars . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we compare our photometry to canonical models at standard cluster abundances , canonical models with enhanced helium ( consistent with cluster self - enrichment at early times ) , and flash - mixed models formed via a late helium - core flash on the white dwarf cooling curve . </S>",
    "<S> we find that flash - mixed models are required to explain the faint luminosity of the blue hook stars , although neither the canonical models nor the flash - mixed models can explain the range of color observed in such stars , especially those in the most metal - rich clusters . aside from the variation in the color range , </S>",
