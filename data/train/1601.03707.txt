    "weyl semimetal is a name given to specific materials that host weyl fermions in three dimensions in which time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath0 ) or inversion symmetry ( @xmath1 ) is explicitly broken @xcite .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian near the isolated band touching points ( weyl points ) is reminiscent of the weyl equation or massless dirac equation from high energy physics @xcite , given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the triplet pauli matrices and @xmath4 is a 3-component brillouin zone momentum and @xmath5 denote the chirality .",
    "in contrast to two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems @xcite , the weyl point is robust to any external perturbations as the three components of the momentum are required to vanish at the point of degeneracy .",
    "the breaking of @xmath0 or @xmath1 separates the weyl nodes in momentum space and they become topologically stable@xcite .",
    "the topological properties of weyl points are manifested as monopoles of berry flux in the the brillouin zone ( bz ) with point - like fermi arcs surface states @xcite .",
    "however , when the fermi arcs are not point - like but tilted , there is another possibility of weyl semimetals dubbed type - ii weyl semimetals@xcite . in recent years",
    ", there have been many proposals of systems that host weyl semimetal phases .",
    "the pyrochlore iridates@xcite are well - known as one of the materials in which a weyl semimetal phase can be observed .",
    "a very simple model using the surface states of a strong 3d ti heterostructure has been proposed@xcite .",
    "weyl semimetal phase has been proposed in the magnetically doped topological band insulators@xcite .",
    "there is also a toy tight binding model proposal that captures the existence of weyl semimetal phase @xcite .",
    "recently , weyl semimetal has been discovered experimentally in photonic crystals@xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of weyl semimetal in taas has also been reported using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we demonstrate that weyl semimetal can be realized in an alternating ordinary insulator and thin film of topological insulator ( ti ) multilayer .",
    "this heterostructure has some similarities to the model studied by burkov and balents @xcite .",
    "however , the ultrathin film of ti possesses a different hamiltonian @xcite . besides",
    ", they can be easily grown in the laboratory and have been realized in most experiments in ultrathin bi@xmath6se@xmath7 and bi@xmath6te@xmath7 films @xcite . in experiments",
    ", it is indeed possible to grow quintuple layers ( ql ) of an ultrathin film of ti , in which two bi and three se or te layers are stacked together .    in particular , we show that in the absence of a magnetic field and structure inversion asymmetry the thin film of ti multilayer captures a phase with two dirac nodes , which annihilate each other at the phase transition point and opens a gap to a 3d qsh phase . in the presence of an external magnetic field , however , the system breaks @xmath0 but preserves @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the magnetic field introduces a 3d qah phase .",
    "we also find a phase with two weyl points separated in momentum space ( weyl semimetal ) and an ordinary insulator .",
    "adding a structure inversion asymmetry term introduces a potential difference between the top and bottom surfaces of each layer and breaks @xmath1 but preserves @xmath0 , while the magnetic field breaks @xmath0 but preserves @xmath1 , and the whole system then breaks both symmetries . in this case",
    ", the system still produces a weyl semimetal phase and the nodes still occur at zero energy .",
    "we also analyze the effects of an orbital magnetic field and obtain the landau level spectra of the system .",
    "the zero landau levels capture the appearance of weyl semimetal phase in the vicinity of the bulk gap .",
    "finally , we show that in the absence of the magnetic field and the structure inversion asymmetry , the continuum limit of the ultrathin film ti multilayer is the same as the continuum limit of the toy tight binding hamiltonian of weyl semimetal@xcite .",
    "following burkov and balents @xcite , we study a simple hamiltonian of an ultrathin film of topological insulator heterostructure ( fig .  [ hetero ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is governed by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 here , @xmath3 are the pauli matrices on the real spin space and @xmath10 are the _ which surface _ pseudo spins . @xmath11 is a 2d momentum vector in the bz .",

    "describe the low - energy hamiltonian of a single 2d ultrathin film of ti layer @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the hybridization potentials that couple the top and bottom surfaces of the same thin film layer for small @xmath16 and large @xmath16 respectively .",

    "in fact , the first three terms in eq .   have recently been studied@xcite .",
    "the electrostatic potential introduces a potential difference of @xmath18 between the top and bottom surfaces .",
    "the zeeman splitting is @xmath19 and can be induced by depositing a ferromagnetic material on the thin film ( magnetic doping ) or directly applying a magnetic field . here",
    "@xmath20 is the land @xmath20-factor of the thin film , @xmath21 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath22 is the magnetic field .",
    "the new parameter we introduce in eq .",

    "this is the hybridization potential that couples the top and bottom surfaces of neighbouring thin film layers along the growth @xmath24-direction .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and @xmath23 depend on the thickness of the thin film .",
    "the first three parameters have been determined both numerically @xcite and experimentally@xcite .",
    "the new parameter @xmath23 can also be determined by growing the multilayer in fig .  .",

    "let us first consider a very simple case @xmath28 in eq .  . to study the topological properties of this system it is expedient to fourier transform into momentum space along the growth @xmath24-direction",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath44 are @xmath45 , where ( k_z , k_)= - t_k_^2 + ( k_zd).the corresponding eigenspinors are @xmath46",

    "the two dirac nodes are not protected by symmetry and they are required to annihilate at the phase transition point @xmath62 giving rise to fully gapped phase ( qsh phase ) for @xmath63.,width=268 ]    we see that the @xmath0-invariant ultrathin film ti multilayer captures a phase with two dirac nodes along the @xmath64-axis for @xmath65 . however , since having only @xmath66 and @xmath67 symmetries can not produce stable dirac points with non - trivial topological invariant number @xcite , additional symmetry ( e.g. crystal rotational symmetry ) is required to stabilize the dirac points as in the case of 3d dirac semimetal proposed in cd@xmath7as@xmath6 and na@xmath7bi @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present model the dirac points must annihilate each other ( see fig .",
