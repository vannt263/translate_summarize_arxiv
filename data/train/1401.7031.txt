    "current cosmological observations indicate that the universe is currently in an accelerating stage , which suggests that the present universe is dominated by an enigmatic component called dark energy .",
    "although current cosmological observations are so precise that we can have some information on its properties such as its current energy density , the equation of state and so on , we still do not know what the dark energy is . since the identification of dark energy is one of the most important problems in contemporary science , many researches have been performed to pursue this issue and a lot of models for dark energy have been proposed ( for early works , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    among various dark energy models , quintessence , a scalar field model with the canonical kinetic term ,",
    "may be the simplest dynamical dark energy model @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a scalar field might be well motivated by theories of particle physics such as supergravity and/or superstring , which include scalar fields with a variety of types of the potential .",
    "however , the form of potential is strongly constrained to realize the current accelerating expansion and the proposed quintessence potentials can be roughly divided into two types @xcite , depending on how a quintessence field evolves : freezing ( tracker ) and thawing types . for the freezing ( tracker ) type ,",
    "a quintessence field moves fast in the early universe , then `` freezes '' at some later time to realize its equation of state @xmath12 close to @xmath2 .",
    "a typical example of potentials in this category is the inverse power law potential @xcite .",
    "for such a potential , it is well known that the quintessence field exhibits a tracking behavior where it traces the equation of state of the dominant background fluid ( e.g. , radiation and matter ) .",
    "this is the reason why the freezing type is sometimes called `` tracker model '' . on the other hand , in the thawing model",
    ", a quintessence field almost stays somewhere on the potential in the early times , during which it behaves like a cosmological constant . at later times , the quintessence field starts to `` thaw '' or move , that is , starts to roll down the potential @xcite .",
    "the situation is quite similar to that of the inflationary dynamics . as in the case of inflation ,",
    "typical potentials of this type are ( positive ) power law and hilltop type @xcite potentials as in chaotic and new inflation models , respectively .",
    "the difference of these potentials is characterized by the sign of the effective mass squared .    in light of this consideration ,",
    "if we limit ourselves to a quintessence model as dark energy , the first thing we have to do is to differentiate these two types , i.e. , _ freezing _ or _ thawing _",
    ", by using cosmological observations",
    ". unfortunately , current observational constraints are not precise enough to discriminate these types . however , future experiments may well probe the differences and distinguish these models , which is one of the issues that we are going to address in this paper . for this purpose ,",
    "we investigate constraints expected from future surveys of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , galaxy clustering and galaxy lensing shear by using their auto- and cross - correlations .",
    "we also make use of future observations of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) .    in this paper",
    "we adopt typical potentials as the fiducial models of the two types of quintessence .",
    "specifically , we consider a power - law potential for the freezing type while the quadratic and the cosine - type potentials for the thawing type models to generate mock data for future surveys .",
    "then , the generated mock data are fitted to some phenomenological dark energy models with its equation of state @xmath12 being parameterized in a simple form , which have been adopted in many works .",
    "our primary goal is , therefore , to investigate how the confidence regions look like on the plane of dark energy parameters , and to clarify whether one can differentiate the two types from future cosmological surveys .    if one can pin down the type of quintessence , i.e. , freezing or thawing type , the next task is to extract the information of the potential in more detail . in particular , for the thawing type , we have two different , but representative examples of the potential such as quadratic and cosine - type potentials .",
    "one of the differences between the two is characterized by the sign of the effective mass squared .",
    "this difference is important from both theoretical and observational reasons .",
    "from the model building point of view , it is challenging to construct a quadratic potential because it must be flat beyond the planck scale in order to dominate the energy density at late times .",
    "however , once such a potential is realized , the field can easily take a suitable value during inflation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the hilltop ( cosine ) type potential @xcite naturally appears as an axion potential from particle physics models . for this type of potential ,",
    "the field value is not necessarily required to exceed the planck scale thanks to the offset of the potential , although it suffers from a severe initial value problem because there is no natural reason to keep sitting on the top of the potential .",
    "thus , it is quite important to distinguish the sign of the effective mass squared of the potentials from this viewpoint .",
    "in fact , the sign of the effective mass squared appears in the evolution equation of perturbations so that it may leave significant imprints on the large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "thus , we also investigate how accurately we can determine the effective mass squared of the potentials from the future observational data . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a new parameterization for dark energy equation of state , in which the sign of the effective mass squared is incorporated as a free parameter .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we briefly summarize the quintessence potential for fiducial models adopted in our analyses in sec .",
    "[ sec : quin ] , and some phenomenological parameterizations for the dark energy equation of state are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : deparam ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbation ] , we summarize the procedure of our analyses . the results of the analyses are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : forecast ] .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion and summary of this paper .",
    "the equation of motion for a scalar field @xmath13 in a flat universe is given by @xmath14 where primes denote the derivative with respect to the conformal time , @xmath15 is the conformal hubble parameter , @xmath16 is a potential of scalar field and @xmath17 .",
    "the energy density and pressure of a scalar field are given by @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the ratio of the two , @xmath19 , is an equation of state for a scalar field .",
    "since we use cosmological data including the information of density fluctuations such as cmb , one also has to consider fluctuations in a quintessence field . working in the synchronous gauge , the evolution equation for fluctuations of the quintessence field",
    "is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is metric perturbation in the synchronous gauge @xcite and @xmath22 .",
    "fluctuations of density , pressure and velocity divergence of quintessence are , respectively , given by @xmath23    as mentioned in the introduction , quintessence models can be divided into two types , i.e. , thawing and freezing ( tracker ) ones .",
    "although there are still some variations of the potential form for each type , as fiducial models in this paper , we adopt the following representative potentials discussed in the literature .    for the thawing quintessence model , only two types of potentials have been considered in most cases .",
    "one is a simple quadratic potential , whose explicit form is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass for the quintessence . since @xmath13 begins to roll down the potential at very late epoch to realize the accelerating expansion today , the mass is roughly of the order of the present hubble parameter @xmath26 . in addition , in order to dominate the energy density at late time , the field value @xmath13 needs to be close to the planck value .",
    "the other type is the cosine one of the form @xcite : @xmath27 this pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson type of potential can well be motivated from some particle physics models and has been discussed in many papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "concerning the freezing ( tracker ) type , although many forms of potential have been argued , most of them include inverse power law or exponential parts in the potential , which allow an attractor solution .",
    "here we consider a typical inverse power law type of the form : @xmath28 as mentioned above , there have been many models ( potentials ) discussed so far .",
    "for other freezing ( tracker ) types , see e.g. , @xcite . in this paper , we take these potentials as the fiducial models for each type .",
    "since we have not yet understood the nature of the dark energy , it is common to treat dark energy as an ideal fluid with a negative equation of state .",
    "here we follow this procedure and investigate how dark energy parameters , in particular , its equation of state defined below are constrained from future surveys .",
    "although various parameterizations for @xmath12 can be found in the literature , we assume three parameterizations as described below",
    ".      one of the aims of this paper is to discriminate the freezing and the thawing models , whose equation of states decreases and increases with time , respectively .",
    "this feature can be captured by the following parameterization @xcite , whose form is given by @xmath29 it is expected that @xmath30 for the freezing model while @xmath31 for the thawing model .",
    "we call this parameterization `` parameterization i '' in the following . with this equation of state @xmath12",
    ", one can write its energy density as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy density of dark energy at present time . in the above parameterization",
    ", @xmath12 has a simple linear dependence on the scale factor @xmath34 , but another parameterization of this type is also possible such as @xmath35 , where a linear dependence on a redshift @xmath36 is assumed @xcite with a cutoff at some redshift to avoid large @xmath12 at earlier time .",
    "but in the following , we consider the parameterization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eos1 ] ) as a representative one of this category .",
    "the equations of states for the freezing and the thawing models are also characterized by the fact that @xmath12 is larger ( smaller ) in the past for the freezing ( thawing ) model .",
    "this feature can be directly probed by the following parameterization @xcite , @xmath37 where the equation of state changes from @xmath38 to @xmath39 at the transition redshift @xmath40 with its width characterized by @xmath41 .",
    "it is expected that @xmath42 for the freezing model while @xmath43 for the thawing model .",
    "we call this form of @xmath12 `` parameterization ii '' in this paper",
    ". the energy density of dark energy with this parameterization can be analytically given by @xmath44      the above two parameterizations are suitable for discriminating the thawing and the freezing models .",
    "once the thawing models would be favored from future observations , the next task is to differentiate two typical thawing models , in which the signs of the effective mass squared are opposite , that is , positive and negative .",
    "such a difference in the sign of the effective mass squared is expected to affect the evolution of the perturbations .",
    "thus , in this subsection , we discuss what kind of parameterization is suitable for probing the sign of the effective mass squared of a quintessence field through its perturbations .    for this purpose ,",
    "let us first remind ourselves how fluctuations in dark energy fluid evolve with a given equation of state @xmath12 . working in the synchronous gauge @xcite ,",

    "one can consider non - vanishing @xmath48 for a general dark energy fluid @xcite , but we can safely set @xmath49 for a quintessence field .",
    "furthermore , the effective sound speed @xmath50 , which is the sound speed defined in the dark energy rest frame , is defined through @xcite @xmath51 for a scalar field with the canonical kinetic term , the effective sound speed is @xmath52 .",
    "the adiabatic speed of sound @xmath53 for a fluid is given by @xmath54    by analogy with the case of inflation , let us try to parameterize the equation of state by using its potential , which is characterized by the slow - roll parameters @xcite .",

    "hence name the ( late - time ) integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite .",
    "since the cross - correlation between cmb and lss such as galaxy clustering and week lensing field arises due to the isw effect , the presence of non - vanishing cross - correlation between cmb and lss on large scales can be a signature of dark energy .",
