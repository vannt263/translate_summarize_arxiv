    "the main goal of large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to confirm the higgs mechanism and to find particle contents and the physics law above the electroweak scale .",
    "so far many new physics models beyond the standard model have been proposed . among them , technicolor ( tc )  @xcite is one of the most attractive candidates  @xcite as it does not require elementary scalar particles which cause , so - called , the fine - tuning problem .",
    "this model is basically a qcd - like , strongly interacting vector - like gauge theory .",
    "therefore , lattice gauge theory provides the best way to study this class of model@xcite , and the predictions can be as precise as those for qcd , in principle .",
    "the simple , qcd - like tc model , _",
    "i.e. _ an su(3 ) gauge theory with two or three flavors of techniquarks , has been already ruled out by , for instance , the s - parameter@xcite and the fcnc constraints .",
    "however , it has been argued that , if the gauge coupling runs very slowly ( `` walks '' ) in a wide range of energy scale before spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs , at least , the fcnc problem may disappear@xcite .",
    "such tc models are called walking technicolor ( wtc ) and several explicit candidates are discussed in semi - quantitative manner in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the dynamics in wtc might be completely different from that in qcd and hence the use of the naive scaling in @xmath0 or @xmath1 to estimate various quantities may not work , the @xmath2-parameter must be evaluated from the first principles  @xcite .",
    "although really important quantity is the anomalous dimension of @xmath3 operator , looking for theories showing the walking behavior is a good starting point .",
    "recently many groups started quantitative studies using lattice technique to answer the question what gauge theory shows walking behavior . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the running couplings of 8- and 12-flavor qcd are studied on the lattice using the schrdinger functional  ( sf ) scheme@xcite .",
    "their conclusion is that while 8-flavor qcd does not show walking behavior 12-flavor qcd reaches an infrared fixed point ( irfp ) at @xmath4 . in spite of the scheme - dependence of running and its value of irfp , the speculation inferred from schwinger - dyson equation",
    "@xcite suggests that @xmath4 is not large enough to trigger spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "although 12-flavor qcd is still an attractive candidate and is open to debate  @xcite , we explore other @xmath1 . in the following ,",
    "we report the preliminary results on the running coupling in 10-flavor qcd .",
    "since the conference , statistics and analysis method are changed .",
    "the following analysis is based on the increased statistics and a slightly different analysis method .",
    "before going into the simulation details , let us discuss some results from perturbative analysis . in this work",
    ", we adopt the @xmath5 function defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes a length scale .",
    "the first two coefficients are scheme - independent , and given by @xmath8 , & \\ \\ \\ &       b_2   = \\frac{2}{(4\\pi)^4 } \\left[\\ , 102 - \\frac{38}{3}n_f\\,\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : b1-b2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] other higher order coefficients are scheme - dependent and are known only in the limited schemes and orders . in this section ,",
    "we analyze the perturbative running in the four different schemes / approximations : i ) two - loop ( universal ) , ii ) three - loop in the @xmath9 scheme , iii ) four - loop in the @xmath9 scheme , iv ) three - loop in the schrdinger functional  scheme .",
    "the perturbative coefficients relevant to the following analysis are @xmath10 , \\label{eq : beta-3ms}\\\\       b_4^{{\\overline { \\rm ms } } }   & = & \\frac{2}{(4\\pi)^8 }       \\left[\\ , 29243.0              - 6946.30\\,n_f              + 405.089\\,n_f^2\\ ,              + 1.49931\\,n_f^3\\       \\right],\\\\       b_3^{\\rm sf }   & = & b_3^{{\\overline { \\rm ms } } } + \\frac{b_2\\,c_2^{\\theta }         } { 2\\pi }                    - \\frac{b_1\\,(c_3^{\\theta}-{c_2^{\\theta}}^2)}{8\\pi^2 } , \\label{eq : b3sf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 depend on the spatial boundary condition of the sf used in calculations ,",
    "_ i.e _ @xmath13 .",
    "those for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 are known as @xmath17 but @xmath18 is not .",
    "therefore , the case iv ) is studied with @xmath13=@xmath19 .",
    "notice that in our numerical simulation @xmath13=0 and thus , rigorously speaking , the example iv ) is not applied to our numerical result .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as usual @xmath5 function , large negative value of @xmath20 means rapid increase with length scale of the coupling , and @xmath20 flipping the sign indicate the existence of irfp . as seen from the figure , in either pairs of @xmath21 the discrete beta function approaches to zero from below when @xmath22 decreases from 0.8 to 0.2 , and this happens independently of the choice of @xmath23 .",
    "this means that at around @xmath24=1.25 the running starts to slow down , _",
    "i.e. _ `` walk '' . in order to confirm that this behavior persists even in the continuum limit , simulations on a larger lattice",
    "is necessary .",
    "the running coupling constant of 10-flavor qcd is studied .",
    "the perturbative analysis suggests that this theory is extremely interesting .",
