    "the idea of the future electronics based on the spin degree of freedom instead of charge has emerged during last years .",
    "the term of `` spintronics '' is one of the most frequently used in the modern solid state physics @xcite in various aspects .",
    "manipulation of the spin by electric field is an important problem met on the way to achieve a reasonable alternative to traditional charge - based semi - conductor electronics .",
    "the early work of datta and das suggested the electrical control of the spin utilizing the rashba spin - orbit interaction @xcite , which has recently been realized experimentally @xcite in a semi - conductor heterostructure .",
    "spin transport and gate control has also been realized in carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "recently half - metallicity has been induced by external electric field applied to the graphene nanoribbon @xcite .    in the present work we focus on small semiconductor quantum dots ( qd ) which offer better scalability and are compatible with present semiconductor technology . when operated by the gate voltage in the coulomb blockade regime ,",
    "such a qd acts as a single - electron transistor ( set ) @xcite .",
    "we will show that in the presence of ferromagnetic leads set can invert the spin of the incoming current due to coulomb interactions inside the set .    to date",
    ", many theoretical studies of the interacting dots with ferromagnetic leads have have been reported @xcite .",
    "these ideas have been realized experimentally very recently @xcite .",
    "we show that in the vicinity of degeneracy points at hubbard resonances , where the spin - up and spin - down dot occupancies are equal , the interacting qd in the coulomb blockade regime can serve as an effective spin polarizer .",
    "we predict two experimentally promising conditions for spin switching : i ) the effect is enhanced if the dot is asymmetrically coupled to the leads , experimentally advantageous condition giving a possibility of different switching fields of the leads @xcite , ii ) the current flowing into the dot should not be fully polarized because the mechanism of the control of spin polarization is due to the coulomb interactions between electrons with opposite spins .",
    "thus , within the presented proposal , we take advantage of the inevitably encountered experimental situation , that the resultant current flowing from spin - polarized electrode into the dot is not 100 percent polarized .    the tunnelling junction between a ferromagnetic metal and 2d electron gas inside the semiconductor heterostructure @xcite , which the quantum dot is formed of , can be approximated by a ferromagnetic - normal metal interface ( f / n ) @xcite .",
    "for such a junction the degree of polarization of the injected current is dependent on the contact resistance and the characteristic resistances of f and n components , given by the ratio of spin diffusion length and effective bulk conductivity of the corresponding component .",
    "apart from the partial loss of the spin polarization of the injected current at the junction , there are several mechanisms of spin relaxation present on the semiconductor side of the junction @xcite . for confined structures they originate mainly from the spin - orbit coupling in the absence of inversion symmetry of the structure and from the hyperfine interaction between magnetic moments of electrons and nuclei . in the following",
    "we will consider the situation where the current injected into the dot partially loses its initial polarization and is not fully polarized even if the source electrode were .",
    "thus , the polarization of the lead , described below in terms of @xmath0 widths of the dot level , should be understood as the effective lead polarization `` seen '' by the dot localized state after all spin polarization - loss processes took place .",
    "the device is described by anderson hamiltonian @xcite , where the dot takes the role of magnetic impurity and the ( polarized ) leads are analogues of host metal : @xmath1\\\\+ \\sum_{k,\\sigma,\\alpha = l , r}\\epsilon_{k\\alpha,\\sigma}c_{k\\alpha,\\sigma}^{+}c_{k\\alpha,\\sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first two terms describe the dot with the presence of coulomb interactions @xmath2 .",
    "the bare dot level is shifted by the gate voltage acting on the dot capacitatively : @xmath3 , and its initial position is assumed to coincide with fermi level @xmath4 .",
    "the third term describes the tunnelling between the dot and the leads , represented by the last term in eq .",
    "( [ for1 ] ) .",
    "the electron energy in the leads is spin - dependent , @xmath5 , because the leads are assumed to be spin polarized .",
    "we neglect the spin dependence of the tunnelling matrix elements @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) which are rather dependent on the potential barrier between the dot and a given lead .",
    "thus , the spin dependence of the qd level width @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is caused by the coupling to the leads with different spectral densities @xmath10 , which are assumed to be featureless and constant .",
    "let us define the polarization of the quantity @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "for the lead @xmath13 it is : @xmath14 , which can be expressed by the spin - dependent qd widths : @xmath15 .    the retarded dot green function @xmath16 is obtained by solving the set of equations of motion of the green functions in the hubbard approximation @xcite . within this approximation the two - particle green functions describing spin - flip processes ( generating kondo effect ) on the localized level are neglected .",
    "the green functions that describe the normal scattering of band electrons on an impurity are approximated by decoupling of band electrons from impurity electrons .",
    "the hubbard approximation is valid for large @xmath17 ratio , when the hubbard subbands are well separated in energy scale .",
    "it is the simplest scheme which describes correlated electrons , placed on the approximation scale between hartree - fock approximation for interacting but uncorrelated electrons , and the schemes for strongly correlated electrons , leading to kondo physics .",
    "thus , it is most suitable for the description of a spin - degenerate qd level in the coulomb blockade regime of the lead - dot coupling .",
    "the fourier - transformed expression for qd green function with the spin @xmath5 has the form : @xmath18^{-1}\\\\\\simeq \\frac{1-\\langle n_{\\bar{\\sigma}}\\rangle}{\\omega-\\epsilon_{d}+\\frac{i\\gamma_{\\sigma}}{2}}+\\frac{\\langle n_{\\bar{\\sigma}}\\rangle}{\\omega-\\epsilon_{d}-u+\\frac{i\\gamma_{\\sigma}}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ g1gen ] ) has been written as the sum of two hubbard resonances , whose spectral weights are controlled by the dot level occupancy with the opposite spin @xmath19 .",
    "this feature , caused by coulomb interactions between electrons with opposite spins , is crucial for the spin switching effect .",
    "the occupancies of spin @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be very different for the given gate voltage in spite of degeneracy @xmath22 , because of the different widths of @xmath23 and @xmath24 levels introduced by polarized electrodes .",
    "occupancies have been calculated selfconsistently from the set of coupled equations : @xmath25 the `` lesser '' dot green function @xmath26 can be expressed by the spectral density of the dot @xcite , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath29/(\\gamma_{l\\sigma}+\\gamma_{r\\sigma})$ ] has a two - step profile defined by the chemical potential in the leads : @xmath30 and collapses into equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath31 in the limit of zero bias between the leads , @xmath32 .",

    "when the leads are unpolarized , @xmath35 , the occupancy curves for @xmath36 and @xmath37 coincide and the usual plateau of the width @xmath38 appears when the first @xmath39 and second @xmath40 hubbard levels are filled with electrons when gate voltage changes ( see solid curve in fig .",
    "( [ fig1]a ) ) .",
    "an introduction of the spin - polarized leads changes the situation .",
    "the non - monotonicity of the dot spin - up and spin - down occupations appears with the increase of the left electrode polarization ( we focus on the case when right lead polarization @xmath41 and asymmetric qd - leads coupling @xmath42 is assumed in present discussion , unless stated differently @xcite ) .",

    "the present model is formally equivalent to the model of spinless electron double - dot system with coulomb interaction between the dots @xcite for the case of dots levels degeneracy and anisotropy of the levels coupling to the leads . within this model non - monotonicity in the occupancy",
    "has also been encountered .",
    "there are three degeneracy points where @xmath46 shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1]a ) .",
    "two of them are for the gate voltages when the levels @xmath39 ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath40 ( @xmath48 ) respectively coincide with fermi energy .",
    "they are the most advantageous for the spin control .",
    "the third point , when @xmath49 appears when the fermi level is placed between the hubbard levels . for unpolarized electrodes",
    "it corresponds to the symmetric anderson model when @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) @xcite .    for the remaining gate voltages @xmath52 . in the limiting case of @xmath53",
    "the occupancy curves do not change much , the spin down electrons are still supplied to the dot from the right , unpolarized lead to modify the spectral density @xmath44 ( see eq .",
    "( [ g1gen ] ) ) and @xmath54 occupancy as a result of coulomb interactions .    the panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) shows the change of the dot occupancy polarization @xmath55 with decrease of the asymmetry of the coupling to the leads .",
    "the efficiency of the switching of the initial polarization decreases for more symmetric dot - leads coupling , but the device is still operational even for symmetric coupling .",
    "the panel ( c ) shows @xmath55 for various right lead polarizations @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath55 is robust in the range of @xmath57 where coulomb interaction inside the dot plays the role in the spin switching until the right lead has an opposite polarization with respect to the left one .",
    "in such a case the effect is strongly diminished @xcite .",
    "zero bias conductance polarization , @xmath58 , is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig2]a ) for various @xmath59 values .",
    "there are three gate voltage ranges for which the polarization of the initial current flowing from the source can be reverted .",
    "the most favorable for operation are the values @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which correspond to high values of conductance at the coulomb peaks ( see panel ( b ) ) .",
    "the third point at @xmath51 is less favorable because it is placed in - between coulomb blockade peaks , where the conductance is very small . in this point ,",
    "regardless of the initial @xmath59 , @xmath58 reaches the value of -1 and then switches to the value of + 1 .",
    "this feature can be understood when analyzing the expression for zero - bias conductance . at @xmath60 ,",
    "its @xmath61-component has the form : @xmath62 it reaches zero value when the denominator @xmath63 , which for unpolarized leads gives symmetric case : @xmath50 and @xmath64 . for polarized leads",
    "the position of @xmath39 giving @xmath65 is different for each conductance spin component because @xmath66 . in our case , for @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "( [ fig1]a ) ) in - between cb peaks and @xmath69 for smaller value of @xmath57 than @xmath70 , which implies @xmath71 for such gate voltage ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig2]c ) ) . when the gate voltage increases further , @xmath72 in turn reaches zero value and the conductance polarization jumps to the value of + 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath37 and @xmath36 in the region between cb peaks are weakly dependent on the initial @xmath59 polarization and the difference between them is small .",
    "it causes the same weak dependence on @xmath59 of the of zero - bias conductance polarization in this region .",
    "panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) shows the conductance with its spin - dependent contributions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the total conductance does not reach unitary limit because of the asymmetry of the coupling of the dot to the leads .",
    "the conductance peaks are very asymmetric due to the peculiar behavior of the occupancies and coupling asymmetry .",
    "the effect of conductance polarization switching is more pronounced when the dot is asymmetrically coupled to the leads , promoting better control of the leads polarizations by different switching fields @xcite .",
    "moreover , the asymmetric coupling is naturally accessible experimentally , contrary to the fully symmetric coupling which needs some tuning of the quantum point contacts between the leads and the dot .",
    "the current polarization change at the resonances for @xmath47 and for @xmath48 offers a new electron correlations - based mechanism for the change of the sign of tunnelling magnetoresistance by the gate voltage , which has recently been observed @xcite .    the polarization @xmath58 dependence vs. gate voltage",
    "does not exactly match the quantum dot polarization , especially in the gate voltage range where the dot is occupied by one electron .",
    "this is due to the fact that the conductance polarization is not directly related to the dot polarization but rather to the value of the spin - dependent qd spectral densities at the fermi level .    in the limiting case of @xmath53",
    "the conductance polarization is always @xmath76 ( contrary to the dot occupancy polarization discussed above ) because @xmath77 and the spin - down contribution to the conductance is switched off .",
    "the effectiveness of current polarization switching by the coulomb blockaded set is operative in realistic situations , when the electrons incoming to the dot are not 100 percent polarized .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) for the source lead polarization @xmath81 .",
    "for the temperature @xmath82 ( @xmath83 for @xmath84 @xcite ) , which is a typical range for the set operation in the coulomb blockade @xcite , @xmath85 at @xmath47 shown in the panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) . for @xmath86",
    "the switching is less efficient , but still present .",
    "the effect is limited rather by the temperature value for which the coulomb blockade becomes visible @xmath87 .",
    "contrary , the @xmath58 is sensitive to the temperature change in the region close to @xmath88 , panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the increase of thermal broadening of the conductance peaks causes the decrease of the difference between spin up and spin down components in this region , which is reflected in rapid decrease of polarization .",
    "the dependence of the differential conductance polarization @xmath89 on the applied bias voltage calculated at @xmath47 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) along with conductance spin - dependent components for the temperature @xmath82 and @xmath81 . at @xmath47",
    "the dot @xmath39 level matches the effective chemical potential in the leads for zero bias .",
    "the switching effect decreases for finite bias and approaches @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "there are additional @xmath89 polarization anomalies , which appear for larger values of applied bias , @xmath92 .",
    "namely , for @xmath93 the chemical potential in the left lead comes into resonance with the @xmath40 level , which is reflected by the maxima shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) of spin components of conductance for such a bias .",
    "similarly , for @xmath94 the chemical potential of the right lead is in resonance with @xmath40 level .",
    "the large bias spin transport has indeed been observed very recently @xcite .",
    "the anomalies at large bias are sensitive to the leads polarization arrangement and asymmetry of the dot - leads coupling @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the spin polarization of the current can be inverted electrically by the gate voltage acting on the set in coulomb blockade regime .",
    "the effect is purely due to coulomb interactions present inside the qd .",
    "current polarization switching is robust to the temperature change and favored by inevitably encountered experimental conditions : asymmetry of the dot - lead coupling and partial lose of the initial current polarization at the dot - lead interface .",
    "the model sheds also new light on layered spin - polarized heterostructures @xcite operated by external electric field , where the bound states can be formed inside the interface due to the spatial confinement and energy structure mismatch of heterostructure components .",
