    "the internal structure of the hadron has continually been a very important and interesting subject in the research field of high - energy physics . from the perspective of the experiment , in terms of the measurements of decay rate or cross section",
    ", one can realize the internal structure ; on the other hand , from the viewpoint of theory , the internal structure is displayed from the distribution amplitude or the form factor .",
    "no matter whether decay or collision happens in the hadron , the strong interaction plays an important role . until now",
    ", the most successful theory for describing the strong interaction is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "however , it is still difficult to carry out accurate calculations based on qcd ; the main key lies in the strong coupling constant , especially in the low - energy region , close to unity .",
    "such large value makes the perturbative calculation an arduous process .",
    "there were several nonperturbative approaches inspired by qcd which could obtain some properties of the hadron and recently , based on the correspondence of string theory in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space and conformal field theory ( cft ) in physical space - time @xcite , a semiclassical approximation to qcd , light - front holography ( lfh ) , was successfully developed for describing the phenomenology of hadronic properties @xcite .",
    "lfh provides mapping of the string modes in ads fifth dimension @xmath4 to the light - front wave function in the impact variable @xmath5 , which measures the separation of the constituents inside a hadron .",
    "the mapping is proceeded by matching certain matrix elements presented within the string theory in ads space and the light - front theory in minkowski space .",
    "this approach , known as bottom - up , allows to built models that have been successful in various qcd applications , such as hadronic scattering processes @xcite , hadronic spectrum @xcite , hadronic couplings and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , and quark potentials @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the main feature of qcd as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction lies in its nonperturbative behavior .",
    "the picture of nonperturbative qcd leads to quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , which are believed to be the two essential mechanisms for forming hadron formation from qcd . undoubtedly , the complicated and nontrivial vacuum is not only the most important object to be understood for the nonperturbative aspect of qcd , but also a starting point for the construction of hadronic wave functions .",
    "furthermore , in the light- front ( lf ) coordinates , the nontrivial vacuum is connected to the particles with zero - longitudinal momentum ( the so - called zero - mode particles ) and the infrared divergences from the small longitudinal momentum @xcite .",
    "in fact , the lf infrared divergences are to be expected as the sources of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite . however , the understanding and application of the true qcd vacuum are still very limited in the lf framework .",
    "thus , here we study the relevant subjects in the lf framework with a trivial vacuum .",
    "an alternate approach which can reveal the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking was proposed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , who chose the field content of the five - dimensional theory to holographically reproduce the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "while this holographic model depends on only three free parameters , it agrees surprisingly well with the seven observables of the light meson .    for compatibility with qcd",
    ", the conformal invariance must be broken and the confinement in the infrared region must be introduced .",
    "there are two types of the modified ads geometry which can achieve this results , as in the literature .",
    "one is the  hard - wall \" ( hw ) model @xcite where partons are free inside the hadron and a hard cutoff is applied as the boundary . unlike the standard bag model @xcite , these boundary conditions are imposed on the impact variable @xmath5 , not on the bag of the radius .",
    "the other is the  soft - wall \" ( sw ) model @xcite which has no sharp boundaries and employs a background dilaton field in the ads space as a smooth cutoff .",
    "a problem with the hw model is that the dependence of hadron masses on the higher orbital angular momenta is linear , which is different from the quadratic behavior or the so - called  regge trajectory \" .",
    "conversely , the sw model was initiated for solving the problem of the hadronic mass spectrum .",
    "each of these two models has certain advantages which are explained the above references .    in this work ,",
    "we study the wave functions of light and heavy mesons and make the comparisons of the asymptotic behaviors of the electromagnetic ( em ) form factor , the distribution amplitudes , and the @xmath3-moments in both the hw and sw holographic models .",
    "the case of the massless constituents is first considered , and a generalization regarding the behavior of the massive quarks @xcite follows .",
    "there are two points worth mentioning : first , for the hw model , we use the parameter @xmath6 instead of @xmath7 to represent the size of the meson in both cases of the massless and massive constituents .",
    "second , for the sw model , although both dilaton field profiles @xmath8 have been used in the literature @xcite to reproduce the behavior of regge trajectories for higher spin states , and the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite related these solutions by a canonical transformation , the main motivation for using the dilaton field profiles @xmath9 is its seemingly better confinement properties @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , on one hand , the dilaton exponential @xmath10 leads to the existence of a spurious massless scalar mode in the model ; on the other hand , the desired confinement properties can be realized in the model with the dilaton exponential @xmath11 .",
    "thus , here we apply the latter one to both the hadronic field and the bulk - to - boundary propagator .",
    "the remained of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the extraction of wave functions by the holographic mapping of the light - front formulism to ads string mode . in sec .",
