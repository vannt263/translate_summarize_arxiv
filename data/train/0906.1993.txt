    "the sts work suggests that for heavily underdoped bi:2212 samples with @xmath22 values of 20 and 45 @xmath20 there are fermi arcs ( strictly speaking in the superconducting state these are bogoliubov arcs ) whose length in * k*-space is still @xmath94 of that of the large hole - like fermi surface seen in overdoped samples where there is no pseudogap . as the mott insulating state is approached both techniques show a loss in density of states or spectral weight near @xmath95 . but our results suggest that @xmath83 is reduced by a factor of 25 when @xmath22 = 40 @xmath20 while at first sight the sts work only gives a factor of 3 reduction . our data can be reconciled with sts if this loss of states also occurs in the region of the arcs , but over an energy range smaller than @xmath96 , so that the bogoliubov quasi - particle peaks are still visible in sts .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the model in ref .",
    "in which the pg is usually smaller than the superconducting gap .",
    "however we note that a microscopic theory of this effect also needs to consider what happens when a supercurrent is produced by uniformly displacing the fermi surface in * k*-space . assuming that the pg is not displaced , then this continuity requirement seems to imply that only regions with a finite density of states at , and close to , @xmath95 will contribute to the supercurrent .",
    "we report direct evidence that at low @xmath16 the superfluid density of bi:2212 falls rapidly for @xmath9 , which supports scenario b for the pseudogap in this widely - studied @xcite compound . for both samples @xmath80 is extremely small in the heavily under - doped region , down by a factor @xmath97 while @xmath23 remains relatively high ( @xmath98 40 @xmath20 ) . in conjunction with recent",
    "sts work @xcite this could be a useful constraint for theoretical models . for many values of @xmath8 there is evidence for a linear @xmath16-dependence of the superfluid density over an unusually wide range of @xmath16 and preliminary evidence for `` super - linear '' behavior below @xmath99 @xmath20 in over - doped samples of pure bi:2212 .",
