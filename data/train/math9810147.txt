    "in @xcite , ohtsuki extracted a series of rational topological invariants denoted by @xmath3 of oriented homology 3spheres from the @xmath4 quantum invariants of reshetikhin and turaev @xcite .",
    "physically , they correspond to the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of witten s chern ",
    "simons path integral at the trivial connection as shown by rozansky @xcite .",
    "this construction stimulated a series of works on finite type invariants of homology 3spheres .",
    "the purpose of this article is to present the following theorem about a congruence relation between the first and second ohtsuki invariants :    for every oriented homology 3sphere @xmath5 , we have @xmath6    * remark*it is known that @xmath7 is equal to the casson invariant of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "here the casson invariant @xmath8 is normalized such that @xmath9 for the poincar homology 3sphere @xmath10 ( @xmath11surgery on the right trefoil knot ) .",
    "it is also known @xcite that @xmath12 for every @xmath5 ( a simpler proof will be given here in section 5 ) .",
    "so the congruence ( [ cong ] ) could also be expressed as @xmath13    the proof of the congruence ( [ cong ] ) goes roughly as follows : in @xcite , we introduced the notion of fermat functions and fermat limit . by an explicit calculation of the fermat limit of a certain @xmath0fermat function involving weighted gauss sums",
    ", we get a surgery formula for @xmath1 .",
    "the congruence ( 1 ) is then first proved using the surgery formula in the case when @xmath5 is obtained from dehn surgery on a knot in @xmath14 .",
    "explicit surgery formulae for @xmath15 were also given in @xcite .",
    "these formulae were used to prove that @xmath15 is a finite type invariant of order @xmath16 in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then use the general machinery of finite type invariants of homology 3spheres to argue that the congruence ( 1 ) for homology 3sphere obtained from dehn surgery on knots implies that it holds for all homology 3spheres .",
    "we originally expressed our congruence in the form ( 2 ) .",
    "when rob kirby saw it , he suggested that we put it in the form ( 1 ) because of the significance of 24 in the study of 3manifolds .",
    "he also asked whether there are general congruence relations among @xmath17 similar to ( 1 ) .",
    "we are unable to have any hint about his question even for @xmath18 because the formulae are rather involved .",
    "it is possible that the congruence ( 1 ) is related with the connection between modular forms and quantum invariants of 3manifolds suggested in @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : we will outline some calculation in @xcite leading to a surgery formula of @xmath15 in sections 2 , 3 , 4 . the reader will notice that formula ( 3 ) is better expressed here than in @xcite , and formula ( 6 ) ( the surgery formula for @xmath18 ) is new here . in section 5 we will prove theorem 1.1 using surgery formulae for @xmath19 and the theory of finite type invariant of homology 3spheres .",

    "if @xmath37 is a fermat function , we will call the rational number @xmath44 the _ residue _ of @xmath37 and denote it by @xmath45 .",
    "the residue of a fermat function is unique .    if there is another rational number @xmath46 such that @xmath47 mod @xmath24 for all sufficiently large primes @xmath24 , then the numerator of the rational number @xmath48 will be divisible by all sufficiently large primes @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 , ie @xmath50 .",
    "a typical fermat function comes from fermat s little theorem ( and hence the name ) . for any rational @xmath51 ,",

    "there are many other fermat functions .",

    "see @xcite for a discussion of the residue of @xmath59 , which turns out to depend on @xmath24 in a quite complicated way .",
    "the set of all fermat functions is a ring over the rationals @xmath60 .",

    "thus , in particular , every polynomial function of @xmath24 with rational coefficients is a fermat function whose residue is its constant term . and every rational function of @xmath24 with rational coefficients is a fermat function if the constant term of the denominator is not zero .",
    "its residue is the value of the function at @xmath71 .",

    "let @xmath104 the following theorem ( see @xcite lemmas 6.1 and 6.2 ) is very important for our study of the @xmath4 quantum invariants of 3manifolds .",

    "note the negative sign on the right hand side of the skein relation .",
    "its effect is to change the usual conway polynomial by a normalization factor @xmath120 .",
    "so for a knot @xmath121 , @xmath122 is the same as the usual conway polynomial of @xmath121 .",
    "in particular @xmath123 the jones polynomial @xmath124 $ ] is defined by @xmath125 note that our normalization differs from the usual definition of the jones polynomial .",
    "actually it is obtained from the usual jones polynomial by changing @xmath84 to @xmath126 and multiplying by @xmath120 .",
    "we put @xmath127 then @xmath128 we also put @xmath129 where the sum runs over all sublinks of @xmath112 including the empty link and @xmath112 itself .",
    "we have @xmath130 and define @xmath131 .",
    "further , we put @xmath132 so that @xmath133 finally for each @xmath134 , we set @xmath135 the invariants @xmath136 are the basic link invariants we use to express @xmath137 .",
    "a link is called an _ algebraically split link _ ( asl ) if the linking number between every pair of components is 0 . in particular ,",
    "a knot is always an asl .",
    "a framed asl is said to be _",
    "unit framed _ if the framing of each component is @xmath138 .",

    "this implies that the following formal power series is well - defined for every asl : @xmath156 another key ingredient is the existence of the fermat limit of the following function : @xmath157_q\\sum_{j=0}^{\\frac{k-1}{2 } } ( -1)^{j }   \\binom{k - j-1}{j}\\binom{k-2j-1}{i } [ 2]_q^{k-2j-1 } \\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath158 is the gauss sum and @xmath159 is the legendre symbol .",

    "the existence of the fermat limit of @xmath161 is established by ohtsuki @xcite , and our computation of this limit is the key to the explicit formulae of ohtsuki invariants .",
    "our computation relies on theorem 3.2 .",
