    "since it began to operate in november 2003 until the time of writing ( about 18 months ) , the ibis / isgri instrument onboard the integral satellite ( winkler et  al .",
    "@xcite ) has discovered up to 40 unidentified x - ray/@xmath0-ray sources in the energy range from 20 to 100  kev ( a regularly updated list is kept in http://isdc.unige.ch/@xmath2rodrigue/html/ + /igrsources.html ) .",
    "these sources can be high or low mass x - ray binaries ( not detected previously due to the absence of hard x - ray surveys ) , isolated pulsars , clusters of galaxies or agns , among other objects .",
    "new observations along the electromagnetic spectrum are necessary to discern their nature .    in this work ,",
    "we present a multiwavelength study of the fields containing the unidentified integral sources igr  j18027@xmath11455 and igr  j21247 + 5058 ( walter et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , as earlier done in combi et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) and in rib et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) but using here the new positions and information reported in bird et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) . based on the properties of the sources found at other frequencies inside the error circles in position of the igr sources , we suggest possible origins for both high - energy sources .",
    "the source igr  j18027@xmath11455 was detected with a significance of 8.9@xmath3 in the energy range from 20 to 100  kev during 769  ksec of observations conducted within the integral / ibis survey of the galactic plane ( bird et  al .",
    "the obtained fluxes compared to the crab are @xmath4=2.6@xmath50.2  mcrab and @xmath6=3.0@xmath50.4  mcrab . within its 2 arcmin - radius position error circle ( at 90% confidence or 1.6@xmath3 uncertainty ) , centered at @xmath7 , we have found two weak point - like radio sources in the 1.4 ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , condon et  al .",
    "@xcite ) maps ( see fig .  [ 1802a ] ) . the first one , the source nvss  j180239@xmath1145453 , has an estimated position of @xmath8 ( 1@xmath3 uncertainties ) , has a flux density of 6.9@xmath50.6  mjy and has no near infrared ( nir ) counterpart in the 2mass catalog ( cutri et  al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the second one , nvss  j180247@xmath1145451 , has an estimated position of @xmath9 , a flux density of 10.5@xmath50.6  mjy , and lies inside and near the edge of the 2@xmath3 position error circle of the faint rosat x - ray source 1rxs  j180245.5@xmath1145432 ( voges et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , which is well within the ibis / isgri error circle . inside the 2@xmath3 position error ellipse of this radio source",
    ", it is located an extended nir source , 2masxi  j1802473@xmath1145454 ( see fig .  [ 1802b ] ) , which has coordinates @xmath10 and magnitudes @xmath11=13.18@xmath50.07 , @xmath12=12.02@xmath50.09 , @xmath13=10.94@xmath50.04 .",
    "the optical counterpart of this nir source has average magnitudes @xmath14=19.3@xmath51.0 , @xmath15=14.9@xmath50.8 and @xmath16=13.8@xmath50.5 in the usno - b1.0 catalog ( monet et  al .",
    "the photometry of the nir / optical counterpart is not consistent with a stellar spectrum .",
    "optical and x - ray observations are planned to confirm the extragalactic nature of the source and to study its spectrum at softer x - rays .",
    "this source was detected with a significance of 6.5@xmath3 in the energy range from 20 to 100  kev during only 70  ksec of observations conducted within the same integral / ibis survey of the galactic plane ( bird et  al .",
    "the obtained fluxes compared to the crab are @xmath4=5.4@xmath50.7  mcrab and @xmath6=9.3@xmath51.4  mcrab . inside its 2 arcmin - radius position error circle",
    "( at 90% confidence or 1.6@xmath3 uncertainty ) , centered at @xmath17 is located the core of the bright radio source 4c  50.55 ( see fig .  [ 2124a ] ) , also known as gpsr  93.3194 + 0.394 , kr2 , nrao  659 or bg  2122 + 50 , among other names .",
    "the core has a flat radio spectrum with a peak flux density of 237  mjy  beam@xmath18 at 1.4  ghz .",
    "it is at the center of an elongated structure of 10@xmath193 arcmin ( see fig .  [ 2124a ] ) that ends in two large radio lobes having peak flux densities of 288  mjy  beam@xmath18 ( nw ) and 92  mjy  beam@xmath18 ( se ) , and spectral indices @xmath200.6 ( where @xmath21 ) , compatible with optically thin synchrotron radiation ( mantovani et  al .",
    "the morphology of 4c  50.55 is typical of a radio galaxy , and the comparison among published radio data shows no significant changes in flux and morphology during the last 30 years ( see , e.g. fanti et  al .",
    "these properties are consistent with an extragalactic source , although , to our knowledge , no conclusive optical counterpart of a galaxy host has ever been reported , probably due to its location close to the galactic plane ( @xmath22=+93.32@xmath23 , @xmath24=+0.39@xmath23 ) .    the estimated position of the radio core from the nvss map and data in the literature is @xmath25 + @xmath26 ( 68% or 1@xmath3 uncertainty ) .",
    "coincident with this position there is the nir source 2mass  j21243932 + 5058259 ( see fig .",
    "[ 2124b ] ) , with coordinates @xmath27 ( 68% or 1@xmath3 ) , and magnitudes @xmath11=13.27@xmath50.04 , @xmath12=12.38@xmath50.06 , @xmath13=11.37@xmath50.04 .",
    "the optical counterpart of this nir source has average magnitudes @xmath14=16.9@xmath50.2 and @xmath15=15.1@xmath50.2 in the usno - b1.0 catalog ( monet et  al .",
    "the photometry of the nir / optical counterpart is not consistent with a stellar spectrum .",
    "there is no catalogued rosat or egret source coincident with igr  j21247 + 5058 .",
    "optical and x - ray observations are planned to confirm the extragalactic nature of the source and to study its spectrum at softer x - rays .",
    "we have presented a multiwavelength study of the emission towards the direction of two recently discovered integral sources , namely igr  j18027@xmath11455 and igr  j21247 + 5058 . inside the position error box of the first one , we have found the radio source nvss  j180247@xmath1145451 , compatible with the soft x - ray source 1rxs  j180245.5@xmath1145432 , and having the extended source 2masxi  j1802473@xmath1145454 as nir counterpart .",
    "we suggest that all these sources are likely associated with the counterpart of the hard x - ray source .",
    "the photometry of the nir / optical source does not agree with a stellar spectrum , hence this object seems to be of extragalactic nature .",
    "this is supported by the extended appearance of the nir counterpart . in the second case",
    ", we have found that the core of an extended radio source , which ends in two large radio lobes , lies well within the position error circle of the integral source .",
    "the morphology of this extended source is typical of a radio galaxy .",
    "coincident with the position of the radio core is a 2mass source , with an optical counterpart not compatible with a stellar spectrum .",
    "if the x - ray emission of igr  j21247 + 5058 comes indeed from a radio galaxy , then it should originate in the core and/or in the first secction of the jet , where synchrotron or inverse compton emission processes dominate ( harris & krawczynski @xcite ) .",
    "this source could be a similar case to 3c  273 ( marshall et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , where the detected x - rays fade along the jet . evidence supporting this possibility was also presented by harris et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) for the radio galaxy m84 . in this object",
    ", these authors found an excess of x - ray emission , or knots , aligned with one of the radio jets .",
    "these knots lie at @xmath2 300 pc from the core and they are coincident with enhanced radio emission ( see their fig .  1 ) , suggesting that the x - rays are produced by a synchrotron mechanism .    recently , bassani et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , have presented a study of extragalactic sources detected by integral during its first year of operation . among them , 10 are active galaxies and one is a cluster of galaxies .",
    "if the extragalactic nature of the sources studied here is confirmed , then many of the unidentified integral sources detected till now could increase considerably the number of extragalactic objects shining in the hard x - ray domain .    finally , it is interesting to note that there is no catalogued egret source coincident with these sources .",
    "multiwavelength observations are currently in progress to unveil the nature of these high - energy sources .",
