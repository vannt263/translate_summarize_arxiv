    "from the @xmath3-wave symmetry of the order parameter of cuprate superconductors , one expects an enhanced sensitivity of @xmath0-axis transport in the superconducting state to disorder , due to the enhancement of the quasiparticle density of states along the gap node directions , and due to impurity assisted hopping @xcite .",
    "both mechanisms lead to as yet unobserved @xmath4-dependences of the @xmath0-axis superfluid density @xmath5 at low @xmath6 , with coefficients that strongly depend on the scattering rate @xmath7 . on the other hand , underdoped cuprates are sufficiently disordered for ( quantum ) fluctuations of the order parameter phase to play a prominent role @xcite , leading to a @xmath6-linear behavior of @xmath8 . here",
    ", we report on the effect of controlled point disorder on interlayer tunneling of cooper pairs in underdoped bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "single - crystalline rods of underdoped bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 were grown using the travelling solvent floating zone technique under 25 mbar oxygen partial pressure @xcite .",
    "the samples used for the study , with @xmath9 k , were cleaved from the same crystalline piece .",
    "the crystals were then irradiated with 2.5 mev electrons using the van der graaf accelerator of the laboratoire des solides irradis .",
    "the irradiation produces homogeneously distributed frenkel pairs , which have previously been identified as strong scattering centers @xcite .",
    "the josephson plasma resonance ( jpr ) frequency @xmath10 of the crystals was then measured using the cavity perturbation technique , exploiting @xmath11 harmonic modes to access different frequencies @xcite , and the bolometric technique using a waveguide in the @xmath12 travelling wave mode @xcite .",
    "the latter technique allows for swept - frequency measurements , necessary to elucidate the weak @xmath13 dependence at low @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath14 is proportional to the @xmath0-axis critical current @xmath15 and to the @xmath0-axis superfluid density : @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the low - frequency dielectric constant and @xmath18 is the @xmath0-axis penetration depth .",
    "sharp jpr resonant peaks were measured for all samples under study .",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath20 decrease with irradiation dose .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath10 to even weak additional disorder contradicts the model of coherent interlayer cooper pair tunneling @xcite . within the framework of a @xmath3-wave bcs model",
    ", the measured proportionality between @xmath14 and @xmath19 can be understood as resulting either from ( i ) the dependence of the interlayer josephson current @xmath21 on the gap magnitude @xmath22 and the quasiparticle conductivity @xmath23 @xcite , or ( ii ) from the decrease of the _ in - plane superfluid density due to strong phase fluctuations .",

    "this contradicts the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath25 should follow different powers of @xmath6 depending on the ratio of @xmath6 , @xmath22 , and @xmath7 . however , it agrees with a dominant role of quantum phase fluctuations .",

    "the temperature- and disorder dependence of the @xmath0-axis cooper pair tunnel current in underdoped bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 is well described assuming a strong effect of quantum phase fluctuations . a @xmath3-wave model without fluctuations",
