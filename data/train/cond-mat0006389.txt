    "in the last decade , the problem of the image restoration ( ir ) has been successfully investigated by means of techniques borrowed from the field of statistical mechanics . among them , it is certainly worthy mentioning the _ maximum posterior marginal _ ( mpm ) and _ maximum a posteriori _ ( map ) estimations . from the statistical mechanical point of view , each recovered image within the mpm estimation can be regarded as the equilibrium state of ferromagnetic spin systems in the presence of random fields at finite temperature . in simple words , the reconstruction of a corrupted image",
    "is achieved by balancing the strength of a linear field , which carries the information of the degraded picture , and a ferromagnetic term which builds relatively large `` one - color '' clusters ( below the transition temperature ) , thus suppressing the isolated pixels thought to be noise . from this point of view",
    ", the map estimation consists in the minimization of the same hamiltonian at zero temperature ( search for the ground state ) , with an appropriate scaling of the random field .",
    "the advantage of the mpm estimation over the map one has been pointed out by marroquin et al @xcite and its performance has been investigated by several authors@xcite . in this direction ,",
    "nishimori and wong@xcite , by unifying ir problem and error - correcting code theory under a single framework , found that the optimal recovering of an image is obtained at a finite temperature ( known as _ nishimori temperature _ in the field of statistical mechanics ) .",
    "their results , however , were restricted to the usual binary spin models ( ising ) , _ i.e. _ black or white images in ir jargon , and many questions about the properties of the gray - scale image restoration ( gsir ) processes still remain open . a first attempt to generalize @xcite to gray - level pictures has been carried out by the authors @xcite by mapping the set of the pixels onto q - state ( chiral ) potts spins in the presence of the random fields . in that case , the symmetry of the potts hamiltonian ( _ hyper - tetrahedron _ ) reduces the problem to a 2-state-_like _ system , where only one bit turns out to be right , and all the others are equivalently wrong without any regard of the whole gray - level scale . whereas this turns out to be an efficient method in the presence of white noise ( each spin is flipped to any of the q values with equal probability )",
    ", things may be different from a transmission channel affected by gaussian noise ( the spin - flip probability distribution is a gaussian ) .",
    "we thus investigate the performance ( both static and dynamic ) of the gray - scaled image restoration using the q - ising model @xcite , whose _ ladder _ symmetry takes in account the distance between the spin values and will allow us to say , for instance , that @xmath0 is better than @xmath1 if the right pixel corresponds to @xmath2 .",
    "the analytical expressions are obtained in so - called mean field limit , where each spin interacts with all the others .",
    "the efficiency of our model is checked by monte carlo simulations and iterative algorithm by using mean - field approximation .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the infinite range q - ising model and in sec .",
    "[ statics ] we give an analytical expression of the hamming distance in the mean field limit . in sec .",

    "9 ( `` chair '' ) .",
    "the original images are degraded by the gaussian noise with a standard deviation @xmath194 .",
    "this standard deviation gives the hamming distance between the original image and degraded one @xmath195 .",
    "obviously , the picture `` chair '' contains much more edges than the picture `` girl '' .",
    "therefore , one of the our aims of this demonstration is to check to what extent our model can detect the edge parts in the real - world picture . in fig .",
    "10 , we plot the hamming distance @xmath188 [ ( a ) ] and @xmath196 [ ( b ) ] .",
    "we choose the degraded image as an initial set of the pixels and investigated the @xmath53-dependence of the hamming distance .",
    "we see that the performance of the algorithm for the `` girl '' picture is much better than that of the `` chair '' picture .",
    "this is because the smoothness term in the effective hamiltonian [ eq .",
    "( [ effham0 ] ) ] is quadratic and it is hard to detect the edges in the `` chair '' picture . for both pictures ,",
    "the optimal performance is achieved around the parameter @xmath197 .",
    "this value is not so different from the parameter which was obtained in monte carlo simulations [ see fig . 6 ( a ) ] .",
    "of course , from a practical point of view , it is possible to stop the monte carlo simulation and not to wait the convergence to the equilibrium state precisely .",
    "then , we may regard the snap - shot as the restored image if the performance is not so bad .",
    "however , in the mean - field approximation we constructed here , the convergence of the iteration is guaranteed .",
    "in this paper we investigated the efficiency of the q - ising model for image restoration problem , when the original image is affected by gaussian noise . by introducing the infinite range model",
    ", we gave an analytical expression for the hamming distance , which is shown to reach its minimum at some finite temperature .",
    "we found that the optimal temperature for the gsir using the q - ising model coincides with the source temperature in contrast to the chiral potts case @xcite .",
    "we also found that as in the ising and potts spin cases , the presence of a parity - check-_like _ term greatly increasing the performance of the gsir process .",
    "although for practical restorations of images , one would nt like to smooth out two points far away , the mean field results provide a remarkable eye - guide for a short - range version of the effective hamiltonian as confirmed by monte carlo simulation on two dimensional pictures . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", we also obtained the time evolution of the hamming distance analytically and found the critical initial hamming distance beyond which the flow does not converges to its optimal value .",
    "we show the dynamical equation we obtained is exactly same as the tdgl equation .",
    "therefore , the destination of the dynamics is one of the local minima of the free energy , and if we fail to select the initial condition , the dynamics converges to the local minimum which does not give the minimum of the hamming distance .",
    "recently , skantzos and coolen @xcite , reported the synchronous dynamics of 1-d and infinite range version of the random field ising model .",
    "they found that the dynamics has much more rich behavior than the sequential ( glauber ) dynamics .",
    "therefore , for our present model system , there is a possibility that if we consider the synchronous dynamics instead of the sequential one , the behavior of the dynamics may be different from the results we obtained here . using the mean - field approximation",
    ", we also constructed the iterative algorithm which converges faster than the monte carlo simulation .",
    "we derived it from a variational principle of the free energy and demonstrate it for two types of the real - world pictures . from those results",
    ", we concluded that we need some extra term which detect the edges if the picture has a lot of edges .",
    "we suppose that the glassy term we introduced in the infinite range model may play this role .",
