    "josephson junction resonators are important elements in superconducting quantum computing circuits . for example , a phase qubit is a josephson junction ( jj ) resonator in which the two lowest energy levels of the resonator describe the qubit states@xcite .",
    "in addition , resonators are useful in measuring qubits in dispersive @xcite and latching @xcite readouts .",
    "we have developed a josephson junction resonator that exhibits a bifurcation of states similar to that in reference @xcite , but has notable differences .",
    "the design of the resonator looks similar to a phase qubit in that the josephson junction is in a superconducting loop .",
    "this allows flux bias into the loop to significantly vary the resonance frequency .",
    "as we discuss below , this has important implications for a qubit readout .",
    "in addition , our resonator is weakly coupled to the environment , which allows us to probe the quality of a single josephson junction when on average there is less than one photon in the resonator .",
    "phase qubit measurements indicate that the quality of a josephson junction for quantum computing is hindered by two level systems within@xcite@xcite .",
    "the nonlinear resonator circuit that we discuss in this paper is shown within the dashed box in figure 1 .",
    "the jj with capacitance @xmath1 and inductance @xmath2 is in series with an inductance @xmath3 .",
    "parallel to this is an inductance @xmath4 and a capacitor @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath4 allows us to apply a dc bias current across the jj with an applied flux @xmath6 and @xmath5 is used to limit the resonance frequency .",
    "this resonator is coupled to transmission lines through the capacitors @xmath7 ( outside the dashed box ) . without coupling ,",
    "the resonator has a quality factor @xmath8 , which is linear with the effective parasitic rf resistance @xmath9 . with coupling",
    ", the resonator is loaded to the measured quality factor @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the external quality factor , which depends on @xmath7 .",
    "one transmission line carries an incoming voltage wave of rms amplitude @xmath12 with input power @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , the other transmission line carries the output ( transmitted ) voltage wave of rms amplitude @xmath14 , with an output power @xmath15 .",
    "the ac voltage @xmath16 from the supercurrent @xmath17 is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "the supercurrent through the junction @xmath20 can be written in terms of dc and ac components .",
    "for small currents @xmath17 , where @xmath21 , we can write @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . assuming that the ac current through the device is @xmath24 and including only the first harmonic in @xmath25 , a power expansion yields @xmath26 , where the constant nonlinear inductance is @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the input voltage wave with the coupling capacitor creates an ac current bias across the resonator circuit , and with the inductance @xmath29 , we calculate the voltage in the resonator and the voltage transmitted though the resonator . like a particle with a nonlinear restoring force , near resonance the system exhibits two stable oscillation states for the same drive amplitude .",
    "we have found agreement between this analysis and a fourth - order runge - kutta simulation , which includes the full shape of the potential .",
    "connect to the resonator through the coupling capacitors @xmath30 .",
    "the resonator contains a parasitic effective internal resistance @xmath31.,width=307 ]",
    "we fabricated the device using conventional photolithography , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "between the two coupling capacitors @xmath32 the resonator contains several lumped elements .",
    "two large interdigital capacitors were used to form @xmath33 .",
    "al wires were used to form @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which have nominal values of 400 ph and 120 ph , respectively .",
    "two small holes in a @xmath36 wiring insulator define two parallel jjs with a total area of 11 @xmath37 , which we refer to as a single junction in the rest of this paper . on the same wiring layer is a via , connecting the other end of the jj to the remainder of @xmath38 .",
    "the devices were measured at @xmath39 45 mk by use of a hemt amplifier at @xmath40 k to amplify the power out of the device .",
    "the loss of the components of the resonator was designed to be low , so that we will be sensitive to any residual losses from within the jj producing a @xmath8 of @xmath41 .",
    "the loss tangent of the interdigital capacitors is negligible , since it was fabricated on a sapphire substrate with a loss tangent of @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath36 , with a moderately good loss tangent of @xmath43 , near the jj produces a comparatively small capacitance ( @xmath030 ff ) which contributes negligible loss . finally , in devices with and without a jj we measured samples with a medium to high external quality factor @xmath44 to accurately extract @xmath8 .",
    "in figure 3 we show the resonance frequency as a function of flux bias @xmath45 , taken from a transmission measurement of the resonator . as expected , we observed periodic behavior of the resonant frequency with the flux quantum . at zero flux bias",
    "the inductance of the junction @xmath46 , was a minimum , which in turn creates a maximum in the resonance frequency at f=8.2423 ghz . moving away from zero flux bias",
    "we observed a decrease in resonance frequency which continues below 7.1 ghz , giving us an observed change in resonance frequency of over @xmath47 .",
    "note that this device exhibits a large slope @xmath48 away from zero flux bias .        in figure 4",
    "we show the frequency sweeps for different input powers at zero flux bias . at the lowest input power shown we have less than one photon in the cavity and the output amplitude is proportional to the input power . as we increase the power the peak becomes asymmetric . at the highest power shown , two stable oscillation states",
    "are reproducibly observed as the frequency is swept in two opposite directions .",
    "thus the resonator has two stable oscillation states even though it resides in a single potential well . because the resonant frequency changes with flux bias , the switching frequency between the two stable oscillation states is also sensitive to the flux bias . as a result",
    "this device can be used as a low - loss flux detector , such as a qubit readout .",
    "the fit parameters for figures 3 and 4 have been simultaneously compared to theory curves in order to find the unknown parameters of the circuit . in the fit presented here",
    ", we fixed @xmath49 and @xmath35 to the nominal values ( above ) and we set @xmath50 pf .",
    "we have also fit the data with the value @xmath51 pf , in which case the quality of the fit is also good . from qubit data",
    ", we estimate that @xmath52 pf , which is larger than the best fit values , but still small compared to the main capacitor @xmath33 .",
    "a fit to the spectroscopy in figure 3 ( not shown ) was used to find @xmath53 @xmath54a ( @xmath55 ph ) and @xmath56=1.68 pf .",
    "a lorentzian fit ( not shown ) to the lowest power frequency sweep in figure 4 , where the response is linear , was used to find @xmath57 ff and @xmath58 @xmath59 , which gives @xmath60 = 7,100 . for reference , we measured a device that was the same except that it did not have a jj or inductor @xmath38 ( and also had a different @xmath61 ) .",
    "this reference device had a @xmath62 , which is much larger than the device without a jj , indicating that additional loss may be caused by the junction .",
    "the values of @xmath60 in these devices also show that this technique is appropriate for studying the loss in a josephson junction . below",
    "we show that the jj resonator described above is also measured below the single - photon level .",
    "the circles in figure 5 show the data for a power sweep taken at the fixed frequency corresponding to the low power resonance frequency for zero flux bias ( f = 8.2423 ghz ) . at low voltages ,",
    "@xmath63 is constant in @xmath64 , indicating linear response .",
    "linear response continues to @xmath65 @xmath66 , where the supercurrent amplitude is @xmath67 = 0.0861 @xmath68 . at larger @xmath14 , @xmath69 is linear in @xmath64 ,",
    "reflecting the expected nonlinearity in @xmath46 with ac drive amplitude .    in figure 5 ,",
    "the fit parameters for low power data in figures 3 and 4 were used to generate the theoretical curve for the power sweep .",
    "these fit parameters and our model describe the entire range of powers shown in figure 5 .",
    "the agreement between data and the theoretical curve indicates that our fit values and model are reasonably accurate .    in order to analyze the quality of josephson junctions for use in a future qubit",
    ", one would like to perform the analysis at ( on average ) less than one photon in the resonator . on resonance the cavity stores an energy @xmath70 for an average number of @xmath71 photons @xmath72 .",
    "in our symmetric resonator photons exit via the output cable at a rate @xmath73 , yielding a power @xmath74 . for our device ,",
    "@xmath75 indicating that we have less than one photon on average in the cavity when @xmath76 dbm and @xmath77 @xmath66 .",
    "since we analyze the quality of the single jj resonant circuit below this power , where the response is linear , we are in the appropriate power regime for investigating jjs used in qubits .",
    "versus @xmath64 at @xmath78 and the low power resonance frequency for zero flux bias ( f=8.2423ghz ) .",
    "the circles show the experimental data , and the line shows the expected theoretical result for parameters determined by fits to figure 3 and figure 4.,width=307 ]",
    "we have designed and measured a high - q josephson junction resonator with a tunable resonance frequency .",
    "we are able to describe the flux bias and nonlinear ac data in terms of a simple lumped element model with a nonlinear inductance for the junction . at low powers , with less than one photon in the resonator cavity , we observe a quality factor of @xmath79 .",
    "this high quality factor below the single photon limit and the performance relative to a reference device , shows that the resonator is appropriate for studying loss in a jj for qubits . at high powers",
    "we observe two stable oscillation states with reproducible switching points , and therefore this device may be useful as a future qubit readout .",
