    "the analysis of dark matter ( dm ) and gas density distributions in galaxies and clusters is presently based on a variety of phenomenological models . following @xcite relaxed dm",
    "halo density profiles are well fitted by empirical power laws @xcite and from n - body simulations by @xmath0 ( nfw ) , where @xmath1 constitutes a scaling radius , chosen to join the asymptotic @xmath2-dependence @xcite .",
    "subsequently a number of modifications were proposed @xcite along with criticism of the universality of the nfw - profile @xcite . comparing the density profiles of dm haloes in cold dark matter ( cdm ) n - body simulations the functional dependence @xmath3 @xcite",
    "was found to provide good fits to all haloes , from dwarf galaxies to clusters at any redshift @xcite , where @xmath4 is related to the spectral index of the initial power spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "recently a universal density profile for dark and luminous matter was suggested @xcite .",
    "physically , we regard the dm halo as a self - gravitating collisionless system of weakly interacting particles in dynamical equilibrium , scale invariant from galactic to cluster scales @xcite .    on the other hand , the phenomenological @xmath5model @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath7 is the core radius , or the double @xmath8-model , a convolution of two @xmath8-models with the aim of resolving the @xmath5discrepancy @xcite , provide reasonable representations of the hot gas density distribution in galaxies and clusters @xcite .",
    "physically , @xmath8 corresponds to the ratio of kinetic dm and thermal gas energy , assuming values @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "since any astrophysical system is subject to long - range gravitational or electromagnetic interactions , the present situation motivates to introduce nonextensive statistics as theoretical basis for both , dm and hot plasma density profiles , utilized successfully to understand observed core - halo structures in astrophysical plasmas @xcite .",
    "in this situation a single parameter @xmath11 characterizes the degree of nonextensivity or coupling within the system .",
    "the corresponding derived power - law distributions constitute a particular thermodynamic equilibrium state @xcite , commonly applied in astrophysical plasma modeling @xcite .",
    "the concept of the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon ( bgs ) thermo - statistics constitutes a powerful tool whenever the physical system is extensive , i.e. the entropy is additive .",
    "this situation holds when microscopic interactions and memory are short ranged and the environment is an euclidean space - time , a continuous and differentiable manifold .",
    "however , astrophysical systems are generally subject to spatial or temporal long - range interactions making their behavior nonextensive .",
    "a generalization of the bgs entropy for statistical equilibrium was introduced from first principles by @xcite and @xcite , suitably extending the standard additivity to nonextensivity .",
    "the main theorems of the classical maxwell - boltzmann statistics admit profound generalizations within nonextensive statistics leading to a variety of physical consequences , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "those include a reformulation of the classical n - body problem @xcite or the development of nonextensive distributions @xcite where the duality of nonextensive statistics , we will focus on , was recognized @xcite .",
    "astrophysical applications @xcite , provided further manifestation of nonextensivity in nature . for a reformulation in the context of special relativity",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the generalized entropy @xmath12 characterizing systems subject to long - range interactions and couplings in nonextensive statistics reads @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the probability of the @xmath15 microstate , @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant and the entropic index @xmath11 denotes a coupling parameter quantifying the degree of nonextensivity , or equivalently statistical correlations , within the system .",
    "a crucial property of this entropy is the pseudo - additivity for given subsystems in the sense of factorizability of the microstate probabilities .",
    "the transformation @xmath17 links the @xmath11-formalism to the tsallis q - statistics @xcite . here",
    "@xmath11 is defined in the interval @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the extensive limit of statistical independence and recovers the classical bgs entropy as @xmath20 .",
    "considering two subsystems @xmath21 and @xmath22 the nonextensive characteristics can be illuminated in view of the entropy mixing by @xmath23 , a relation consistent with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) where the last term accounts for the couplings .",
    "@xmath24 leads to an entropy decrease providing a state of higher order , whereas for @xmath25 the entropy increases and the system evolves into disorder .",
    "hence , @xmath11 can be interpreted as a bifurcation parameter measuring the two statistical realizations of ordering or disordering through correlations . a generalization for multiple subsystems",
    "is discussed by @xcite .",
    "since entropy and probability distributions reside physically on the same level the corresponding generalized energy distributions follow as @xmath26 ^{-\\kappa}$ ] @xcite .",
    "the superscripts @xmath27 correspond to positive or negative values of @xmath11 , @xmath28 are proper normalization constants , and @xmath29 denotes the velocity dispersion or mean energy of the distribution characterising their width ( variance ) .",
    "negative values of @xmath11 are conveniently introduced by changing the sign at appearance , which generates a cutoff at @xmath30 , see @xcite for details .",
    "the innermost and outermost curves correspond to the @xmath31 and @xmath32 solutions , respectively . for increasing @xmath33 both sets of curves converge to the central isothermal sphere solution ( @xmath19 ) indicated by dots , @xmath31 from inside and @xmath32 from outside .",

    "commonly , the relative particles energy @xmath38 is introduced where @xmath39 is the relative potential @xmath40 , chosen to vanish at the systems boundary and satisfying poisson s equation as @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 resembles the exponential mass distribution function defining the structure of an isothermal self - gravitating sphere of gas , in this case identical to the phase - space density distribution of a collisionless system of particles ,    @xmath43    then the corresponding density distribution @xmath44 is found after integrating over all velocities .",
    "combining with poisson s equation ( [ 2 ] ) the solution governs the structure of the isothermal self - gravitating sphere @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium distribution eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) can be obtained by extremizing the standard bgs entropy with regard to conservation of mass and energy .    since eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) applies exclusively to a system of independent particles we introduce now long - range interactions by the generalized entropy functional ( [ 1 ] ) . extremizing eq .",

    "[ fig2],width=283 ]    the duality of equilibria in nonextensive statistics is manifest in two families , the nonextensive thermodynamic equilibria and the equilibria of kinetic equations , where both are related by @xmath66 @xcite . since @xmath67 @xcite",
    "we find for the entropic index @xmath68 relating the two families of equilibria , where with regard to eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) @xmath25 corresponds to the stationary states of thermodynamics and @xmath24 to kinetic stationary states .",
    "the limiting bgs state for @xmath19 is therefore characterized by self - duality .",
    "the nonextensive parameter @xmath11 finds also a physical interpretation in terms of the heat capacity of a medium @xcite .",
    "a system with @xmath25 represents an environment with finite positive heat capacity and vice versa , for @xmath24 the heat capacity is negative .",
    "negative heat capacity is a typical property of self - gravitating systems , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "moreover , contrary to thermodynamic systems where the tendency to dis - organization is accompanied by increasing entropy , self - gravitation tends to result in higher organized structures of decreased entropy .",
    "consequently , the nonextensive bifurcation of the singular isothermal sphere solution into two distributions @xmath48 or @xmath69 , respectively , requires to identify the density profile ( [ 5 ] ) for positive definite @xmath11 as the proper distribution of the thermodynamic state of the gas , whereas the negative definite counterpart is associated to the self - gravitating dm distribution . for @xmath55 both solutions",

    "n corresponds to the polytropic index @xmath73 of stellar dynamical systems where @xmath74 is the adiabatic index .",
