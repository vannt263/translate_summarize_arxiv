    "in the standard flare scenario , the magnetic energy stored in the solar corona is released accelerating particles . however , despite decades of effort , the exact mechanisms remain elusive .",
    "it is still unclear how and where exactly the particles are energized .",
    "hard x - ray ( hxr ) imaging spacecrafts such as yohkoh / hxt @xcite and rhessi @xcite are particularly useful for the spatial and spectral diagnostics of energetic particles .",
    "@xcite have reported observations of a non - thermal hxr source above the top of an x - ray loop , suggesting coronal energy release via magnetic reconnection .    along with magnetic reconnection ,",
    "another important element of the standard flare model is magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence as it is believed to play a key role in a number of processes , from triggering fast reconnection to particle acceleration and transport .",
    "a considerable number of particle acceleration theories have been developed that require the presence of magnetic fluctuations in the flaring loop . assuming a high level of mhd waves , it has been shown that stochastic acceleration can effectively accelerate a large number of both electrons and ions .",
    "these particle acceleration models include both resonant and non - resonant interaction between the particles and various plasma waves .",
    "waves and turbulence can be associated either with current sheets during magnetic reconnection or with reconnection outflows @xcite . as the magnetic field in the solar corona is weak compared to the photosphere",
    ", direct measurement of even the mean field in the corona is problematic .",
    "therefore , the fluctuating components of the coronal magnetic fields and their relation to energetic particles remain unknown . in addition , the location and physics of turbulent acceleration within the general picture of magnetic energy release is still awaiting an observational basis .    in this paper , using rhessi x - ray observations and the visibility analysis technique , we show , for the first time , the presence of energy dependent cross - field transport of energetic electrons in a flaring loop .",
    "we estimate the relative magnitude and energy density of magnetic fluctuations which is required to explain these observations . we show that these hxr observations provide a quantitative basis for the turbulence measurements and its governing role in the evolution of energetic electrons and are suggestive of turbulent electron acceleration in this loop .",
    "we select a goes m@xmath3 class flare , well - observed by rhessi , which was previously analyzed by .",
    "@xcite reported the existence of an x - ray source moving above the x - ray loop and concluded that the observations were consistent with the picture of the formation and development of a current sheet between the loop - top and coronal source .",
    "this april 14 , 2002 @xmath4  ut flare ( figures [ fig : ltc]-[fig : images ] ) shows a simple loop structure over the whole duration of the flare and , importantly , the magnetic loop is filled with dense plasma @xmath5@xmath6 @xcite . unlike the majority of solar flares , which typically produce the soft x - ray ( sxr ) emission in the coronal part of the loop and bright hxr emission in the dense chromospheric footpoints , the source of hxrs is coronal for this flare . because of the high plasma density in the loop ( table [ table:1 ] ) , energetic electrons of @xmath7 kev are collisionally stopped in the coronal part of the loop and produce thick - target emission @xcite . at the same time , for such a dense loop , @xmath8 kev particles have collisional lifetime @xmath9s , so electrons need to be continuously accelerated in order to explain the observed hxr emission .",
    "we analyse this flare in three time intervals corresponding to the rise , peak and decay phases ( see fig [ fig : ltc ] ) . from the x - ray spectra ( fig [ fig : spectr ] ) , we determine the electron acceleration rate @xmath10 and the inverse power - law spectral index @xmath11 of non - thermal electrons , assuming a collisional thick - target model @xcite",
    ". we also obtain from an isothermal component in the spectral fit @xcite : the electron temperature @xmath12 and the emission measure of thermal plasma , i.e. @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the plasma density and @xmath15 is the volume occupied by the thermal plasma .         during the initial phase of the flare , acceleration of electrons up to @xmath16  kev",
    "is observed along with rapid heating of the plasma up to a temperature of @xmath8  mk ( fig [ fig : spectr ] ) .",
    "as the flare progresses , the thermal plasma emission measure grows while the temperature slightly increases reaching @xmath17  mk .",
    "the acceleration rate @xmath10 is found to be around @xmath18  electrons  s@xmath19 . in the decay phase of the flare , the thermal plasma starts to cool , the spectrum of energetic electrons steepens and the number of non - thermal electrons drops .",
    "the main flare parameters are summarized in table [ table:1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     x - ray images reconstructed using the clean algorithm @xcite for the three time intervals are presented in figure [ fig : images ] . a clear loop structure is observed up to @xmath20 kev . since rhessi measures the spatial distribution of x - rays only indirectly , via rotating modulating collimators @xcite , x - ray images can suffer from their reconstruction artifacts and should not be used to determine the spatial size of the source .",
    "instead , a more direct and hence reliable approach is to ` stack ' the rotationally - modulated lightcurves over a number of spacecraft spin periods to produce x - ray visibilities @xcite .",
    "the latter are instrument - independent 2-dimensional fourier components of the hxr source @xcite . for a simple source geometry , as displayed in this flare",
    ", the position and sizes can be determined unambiguously at various energies .",
    "an additional advantage of the x - ray visibility fitting approach is that the statistical errors can easily be propagated to find the uncertainties associated with the inferred parameters of the loop .",
    "have successfully proved the robustness and sub - arcsecond precision of this method for hxr footpoints .",
    "x - ray visibilities are fitted using a curved elliptical gaussian model of the flare @xcite .",
    "this is done for a number of energy ranges between @xmath21-@xmath8  kev and for the three time intervals ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) .",
    "the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) source sizes , specifically the length @xmath22 , and width @xmath23 and their corresponding statistical uncertainties , are obtained and presented in figure [ fig : sizes ] . using @xmath24 and @xmath25 at energy @xmath26  kev , we find the volume @xmath27 occupied by the thermal plasma . assuming a volume filling factor of unity , the plasma density is calculated : @xmath28 ( table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "it is found to be similar to the previous density estimates .    as anticipated from the thick - target scenario in a weakly changing plasma density ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , the source length , @xmath22 , in the direction parallel to the guiding magnetic field , is a growing function of energy .",
    "the reason is that higher energy electrons can propagate further away from the region were they are accelerated , hence making the hxr source larger along the guiding field . in other words , in a dense coronal source , electrons travel a distance determined by their collisional losses .",
    "the stopping distance of an electron emitting x - rays of energy @xmath29 while moving along the guiding field of the loop is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the electron charge , @xmath33 is coulomb logarithm @xcite . for an energy independent length @xmath34 of the acceleration region ,",
    "the fwhm length of the source is given by @xcite : @xmath35 by fitting equation ( @xmath36 ) to the measured @xmath22 , it is possible to determine @xmath37 and @xmath38 [ arcsec kev@xmath39 .",
    "figure [ fig : sizes ] shows that the length of the acceleration region @xmath37 is around @xmath1  cm at the peak of the flare .",
    "moreover , since @xmath40 , @xmath38 can be used as an independent measure to determine the plasma density .",
    "this approach gives plasma densities of @xmath41@xmath6 , @xmath42 @xmath6 , @xmath43@xmath6 for the three time intervals analyzed in this paper .",
    "these densities are within a factor of two from the ones which were inferred above by using the thermal emission of the flare ( see table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "larger densities at the peak and decay phases of the flare can be attributed to the presence of a colder plasma invisible in soft x - rays ( sxr ) with rhessi , as suggested in previous studies of thermal sources .",
    "the clean images ( figs . [ fig : images ] ) show that the loop width ( size perpendicular to the guiding field ) is like the length , growing with energy .",
    "this is seen quantitatively with the visibility forward fitted as a function of energy in figure [ fig : sizes ] .",
    "a growing width @xmath23 with energy is clearly present in the first and second time intervals ( figure [ fig : sizes ] ) but could be absent in the third .",
    "this is particularly surprising as the guiding magnetic field is strong enough to ensure pure field - aligned transport of energetic electrons . indeed , for a mean magnetic field of @xmath44 gauss as measured in this loop using radio data ,",
    "the larmor radius of tens of kev electrons is @xmath45  cm and , therefore , the trajectories of their guiding centers coincide with the magnetic field lines .",
    "collisions are unimportant in producing perpendicular transport for the parameters of the plasma , only resulting in a radial excursion ( classical collisional diffusion ) of the order of the electron gyroradius in a collisional time .     and @xmath46 for the lengths and widths respectively .",
    "the full @xmath47 quoted are calculated using the statistical uncertainties from x - ray visibility fits .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are measured in units of [ arcsec kev@xmath19 ] and [ arcsec kev@xmath39 respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]   and @xmath46 for the lengths and widths respectively .",
    "the full @xmath47 quoted are calculated using the statistical uncertainties from x - ray visibility fits .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are measured in units of [ arcsec kev@xmath19 ] and [ arcsec kev@xmath39 respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    however , it is well - known that particle transport across a mean magnetic field can be dramatically enhanced , well above the collisional value , in the presence of turbulence .",
    "the reason is the braiding of the field lines themselves due to perpendicular magnetic fluctuations . in the presence of magnetic fluctuations",
    "@xmath51 perpendicular to the mean field @xmath52 , perpendicular transport of field lines occurs which is governed by the following equation : @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "field lines braiding is believed to be a dominant process governing the transport of particles in the solar wind @xcite , in laboratory plasmas @xcite , and in thermal coronal loops @xcite .",
    "it is safe to neglect the contribution of perpendicular electric fluctuations and subsequent @xmath54 drift to cross - field transport . for mhd fluctuations ,",
    "the electric field is @xmath55 such that the magnetic drift @xmath56 dominates over the electric drift @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the speed of light and @xmath59 is the alfven velocity ) .",
    "since @xmath60 , the contribution of the @xmath54 drift to perpendicular transport is negligible for non - thermal electrons with energies above @xmath61  kev ( @xmath62  cm  s@xmath19 ) , i.e. @xmath63 , with @xmath64  cm  s@xmath19 in the magnetic loop .",
    "the magnetic field line diffusion coefficient is given by the taylor formula : @xmath65 .",
    "here , @xmath66 is the two - points correlation function and @xmath67 denotes an ensemble average . in the quasi - linear approximation , the perpendicular transport of field lines is characterized by a diffusion coefficient @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the parallel correlation length of the perturbations @xmath51 @xcite . an electron moves a distance @xmath70 along the mean field in a collisional life - time .",
    "therefore , this electron also makes a radial excursion given by @xmath71 , as a consequence of the radial transport of field lines .",
    "this means that the fwhm width of the source @xmath23 should also grow with energy .",
    "it is the sum of the acceleration region width @xmath72 and the diffusion part due to perpendicular transport : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is measured in arcsec kev@xmath19 .",
    "the unique feature of this expression is that it depends on the level of magnetic fluctuations via the magnetic field line diffusion coefficient @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , by measuring the energy dependent width of the flaring magnetic loop ( figure 4 ) , we find automatically the diffusion coefficient for the magnetic field lines , i.e. @xmath76 ( table 1 ) . as anticipated , @xmath23 can be well fitted with a linear fit ( figure [ fig : sizes ] ) to find @xmath48 and the magnitude of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the magnetic diffusion coefficient @xmath77 is changing with time and is strongest when the acceleration rate @xmath10 of non - thermal electrons is at the maximum and the spectral index of the accelerated electrons is smaller ( hardest hxr spectrum ) .",
    "the magnitude of fluctuations at the decay phase is weaker , so the data can not provide a reliable estimate , but only an upper limit .",
    "the energy density of magnetic fluctuations in the loop is @xmath78 .",
    "taking the length of the acceleration region @xmath79  cm as the upper limit for correlation length @xmath80 , the energy density of magnetic fluctuations is @xmath81  erg  @xmath6 and the relative level of fluctuations @xmath82 . for @xmath83  cm ,",
    "the magnetic perturbations follow to be strong @xmath84 , and the energy density of turbulence @xmath85  erg  @xmath6 .",
    "this value is close to the energy density of the flaring plasma @xmath86  erg  @xmath6 and much larger than the energy density of the non - thermal electrons @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the cross - sectional area of the loop , @xmath89 is the thick - target acceleration rate differential in energy [ electrons s@xmath19 kev @xmath19 ] , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the electron energy and mass respectively . using the values from thick - target fit and loop width measurements , the energy density of non - thermal electrons , @xmath92 is about @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95  erg  @xmath6 for the three time intervals respectively .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the energy density of the magnetic turbulence is sufficient to energize at least non - thermal electrons and possibly the whole flare .",
    "x - ray visibility based analysis has allowed us to infer the energy dependent source size for a well observed flaring loop .",
    "both the length and the width of the loop are found to be larger at higher energies .",
    "this is in clear contrast with hxr footpoints , which show the opposite trend ; higher energy sources appear smaller than lower energy sources .",
    "an energy dependent growth of the loop length is expected from the collisional precipitation of energetic electrons along field lines @xcite .",
    "the high density of the loop implies that the electrons are accelerated inside the loop region with the characteristic size @xmath79  cm . at the same time",
    ", the size of the loop perpendicular to the strong magnetic field is an increasing function of energy .",
    "the increase of the loop width implies strong cross - field transport of non - thermal electrons and is found to be consistent with the diffusion of magnetic field lines .",
    "this allows us to determine the level and locations of magnetic fluctuations in the flaring loop . for comparison",
    ", we note that the magnetic diffusion coefficient @xmath96 measured _ in situ _ in the solar wind , where @xmath97 and @xmath98  cm @xcite is about four orders of magnitude larger than our values presented in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "we note that although the length and width of the flare are likely to be governed by parallel transport and diffusion of the magnetic field lines , equations ( [ eq : l],[eq : w ] ) for the width and the length are approximations .",
    "the simultaneous treatment of acceleration , energy losses and cross - field transport is needed to assess the particle dynamics more accurately .",
    "this might lead to super or sub - diffusive cross - field transport of electrons and can not be ruled out by the current data , so the radial excursions can scale as @xmath99 , with @xmath100 close to one .",
    "nevertheless , the width - energy measurements provide a powerful and unique tool to measure magnetic fluctuations in a flaring plasma .",
    "importantly , the energy density of magnetic fluctuations appears to be energetically significant and is found to be larger than the energy density of non - thermal particles .",
    "the temporal and spatial analysis by @xcite of the weaker source above the dense loop analyzed here suggests a picture consistent with formation of a reconnecting current sheet between the loop top and the coronal source . assuming this reconnection scenario",
    ", our observations suggest the presence of mhd turbulence in the loop under the reconnection site . during the event",
    ", the length of acceleration site increases only by @xmath101% , while the width of the bright hxr loop @xmath72 grows with time more than a factor of @xmath102 , which could be attributed to continuous piling up of newly reconnected lines .",
    "the plasma mode responsible for the perturbations remain unknown , but these observations indicate the presence of noticeable magnetic fluctuations during the solar flare inside the loop , where the acceleration of electrons is happening .",
    "it is possible to speculate that the magnetic field fluctuations are produced by magnetic reconnection above the loop and accelerate electrons inside the flaring loop .",
    "this work is partially supported by a stfc rolling grant .",
    "financial support by the leverhulme trust ( epk ) , and by the european commission through the solaire ( mtrn - ct-2006 - 035484 ) and hespe ( fp7-space-2010 - 263086 ) networks is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the overall effort has greatly benefited from support by a grant from the international space science institute ( issi ) in bern , switzerland ."
