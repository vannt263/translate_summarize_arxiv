    "the sample of 16 satellite galaxies of m106 found in this study might contain non members .",
    "most of the misidentifications are expected to be connected with faint background galaxies . the probability to include background galaxies as the satellite galaxies of m106 can be higher in applying the criterion ( 3 ) in  3.1 because the background galaxies ( but still within a few mpc from m106 ) with large peculiar motion could possibly be identified as the satellite galaxies of m106 . in table 3",
    ", there are 9 galaxies with known radial velocities . considering the radial velocity of m106 ( @xmath48kms@xmath49 ) , s3 that shows the largest radial velocity difference ( @xmath50km@xmath49 ) still seems to be within the expected dynamical boundary of m106 ( @xmath51 @xmath52kms@xmath49 ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the probability including misidentification in 9 satellite galaxies with radial velocity information is negligible .    for the remaining 7 galaxies without radial velocity information , we are not able to discriminate the genuine satellites from the misidentified ones . we need to measusre their radial velocities by spectroscopic observations or to derive their distances by high resolution photometry .",
    "observations with higher spatial resolution using space telescope and/or ground - based observations equipped with adapted optics at near - infrared wavelengths are crucial to confirm these galaxies as the satellite galaxies of m106 , by detecting a significant number of red giant branch stars in the satellite galaxies .",
    "one of the possible contaminations in the current list of satellite galaxies of m106 is the inclusion of background galaxies especially for the outer region of m106 .",
    "the number of satellite galaxies at @xmath47 arcmin is four .",
    "two ( s2 and s10 ) of these 4 galaxies have the radial velocity of @xmath53 km / sec , somewhat larger than the radial velocity of m106 but still smaller than or similar to the radial velocity of s3 and s8 . for the remaining two galaxies ( s1 and s16 ) without radial velocity information we are not able to decide if they are dynamically bound to m106 .    to examine the misidentification of background galaxies as the satellite galaxies of m106 , we show the central surface brightness versus total magnitude of both candidate satellite galaxies ( open circles ) and probable satellite galaxies ( star symbols ) in fig . 6",
    "two candidate satellite galaxies ( s4 and s16 ) are located somewhat outside of the @xmath45 boundary , but still within @xmath54 boundary . for the probable satellite galaxies , we find that only p1 is located well inside the boundary . the fitting error for the best - fit linear relation using all the data ( 16 + 5 galaxies ) is @xmath55% larger than that for the best - fit linear relation using 16 candidate satellite galaxies",
    ". s16 shows some resolved stars with an extended halo , which satisfies the most strong selection criterion .",
    "s4 ( ngc4248 ) also shows some resolved stars , and the radial velocity ( @xmath56 km s@xmath49 ) is very similar to that of m106 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that both s4 and s16 are candidate satellite galaxies of m106 .",
    "in addition to the misidentification of the satellite galaxies of m106 , there might be a number of galaxies not included in the current list of satellite galaxies of m106 because of incomplete photometry .",
    "we estimate the expected number of missing satellite galaxies due to the gaps in the present cfht mosaic observations ( see  2 for the description of gaps ) . the width of the each gap is @xmath57 arcmin , resulting in @xmath58 arcmin@xmath59 in the entire observed field .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath60 of the whole observational field of view . since the gap is rather narrow the probability of missing a large ( size @xmath61 arcmin )",
    "satellite galaxy is considerably small .",
    "we estimate the expected number of missing small satellite galaxies ( @xmath62 arcmin ) located in these gaps as follows : first we assume a uniform distribution of the satellite galaxies .",
    "we then assume that if a half of a galaxy is located in this gap we fail to find this galaxy as the satellite galaxy of m106 .",
    "the expected number of missing satellite galaxies due to the gaps of mosaic observation is @xmath63 .",
    "because the distribution of the satellite galaxies of m106 is concentrated toward the centre of m106 and the distribution of the gaps is roughly uniform , the number might be smaller than 0.7 .",
    "we compared the catalogue of dwarf galaxies around m106 of karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with our list of satellite galaxies .",
    "we found that all dwarf satellite galaxies of karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2007 ) near m106 are common in our list except for the dwarf galaxy , d1217 + 4703 that is found to be located in one of the gaps .",
    "this is consistent with the expected number of missing satellite galaxies due to the gaps between ccds in the present study .",
    "we do not include this satellite galaxy , d1217 + 4703 for the subsequent analysis because we do not have its morphology and photometric properties .",
    "it is more difficult to estimate the number of missing satellite galaxies not located in these gaps .",
    "one of the causes that make it difficult to identify the faint satellite galaxies of m106 is the observational limits ; poor spatial resolution and shallow photometric depth .",
    "identification of satellite galaxies of m106 based on the present observations is mainly dependent on surface brightness rather than the total magnitude .",
    "two satellite galaxies ( s11 and s14 ) have low central surface brightness ( @xmath64 mag arcsec@xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that satellite galaxies with extremely faint surface brightness may be missing in the present list of satellite galaxies of m106 .",
    "this is more severe for the galaxies located in f3 because the measured sky brightness of f3 is much brighter than f1 and f2 .",
    "we discuss qualitatively the limit of our detection method by comparing our results th those of @xcite because their observations were also performed using cfht megacam .",
    "@xcite found 22 new dwarf galaxies in the m81 group using a larger field ( @xmath65 square degree ) megacam survey of the m81 group , resulting in a total of 44 galaxies in the m81 group including m81 . to find the satellite galaxies they chose two different methods ; visual inspection by two of three authors , and a 2-point correlation auto - detection routine .",
    "they detected 17 out of 22 new candidates of the m81 group by visual inspection of the megacam images .",
    "to find the satellite galaxies missed in the visual inspection they applied a 2-point correlation auto - detection routine for the photometric catalogue of point sources .",
    "the auto - detection method calculates the 2-point correlation function for the point sources with @xmath66 on scales of @xmath67 kpc , then a spatial region with a higher correlation values might be a candidate satellite galaxy .",
    "@xcite applied this method for their photometric catalogue of the m81 group because they were able to detect a large number of trgb stars in the dwarf galaxies of the m81 group . assuming @xmath68 and typical colours of trgb of @xmath69 , and @xmath70 @xcite , @xmath71 is detected at @xmath72 , corresponding to @xmath73 at the distance of m81 .",
    "they argued that since their observational limit ( @xmath74 ) is slightly fainter than the trgb brightness they detected a significant amount of trgb stars in the satellite galaxies of the m81 group .",
    "auto detection method adds 5 more satellite galaxies to the catalogue of satellite galaxies of the m81 group , mostly galaxies with faint surface brightness .    to investigate the limit of our detection method we compare the observational parameters of both megacam observations .",
    "our megacam observations of m106 is rather deeper ( exposure times in @xmath10-band is @xmath75 times longer than @xmath76-band observations of the m81 group ) .",
    "the atmospheric seeings of the both observations are similar to @xmath77 arcsec , and both observations were carried out at dark nights .",
    "therefore , the photometric limiting magnitude of the present observation is expected to be @xmath77 mag fainter than the megacam observations of the m81 group . however , because the distance to m106 is @xmath75 times farther than the distance to m81 ( @xmath78mpc ) , trgb is expected to be detected at @xmath79 for our megacam survey , similar to or fainter than the magnitude limit of the present megacam observation of m106 . therefore , we expect to detect no or an extremely small number of trgb stars in satellite galaxies of m106 . since 2-point correlation auto - detection method needs a catalogue of points sources in the satellite galaxies we are not able to apply this method for our megacam observations .",
    "our catalogue of satellite galaxies of m106 does not include the galaxies with extremely faint central surface brightness , which were detected in the m81 group ( 4 out of 22 galaxies with @xmath80 ) .",
    "we might miss those extremely faint galaxies in the present catalogue of satellite galaxies of m106 .",
    "mw and m31 in lg have a large number of satellites whose properties are well known .",
    "the m81 group is known to have 43 satellite galaxies of which about half are new findings @xcite .",
    "we compare the properties of the satellite galaxies of m106 with those of mw , m31 , and the the m81 group . because the brightness of 16 satellite galaxies of m106 is much brighter than those of the extremely faint galaxies of mw",
    ", we only consider the brighter ( @xmath81 ) satellite galaxies of mw ( samples in mateo 1998 ; van den bergh 2000 ; metz et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we show the cumulative luminosity function ( lf ) of satellite galaxies of m106 compared to those of the satellite galaxies in lg and the m81 group in fig .",
    "7 . for m106 and the m81 group",
    "we show the @xmath10-band and @xmath76-band cumulative lfs while we display @xmath82-band cumulative lf for lg galaxies .",
    "we exclude the error bars of data points in fig .",
    "7 for the clear comparison",
    ". then we fit the observed cumulative lfs to cumulative schechter lfs ( solid lines ) . to compare the lfs of satellite galaxies we do not include the host galaxies of each system ( mw , m31 , m81 , and m106 ) . for the m81 group , we also exclude the faintest sample from the fit to the schechter lf , which is significantly fainter than the majority of satellite galaxies of the m81 group . the faint end slopes of schechter lfs for m106 , lg , and the m81 group are @xmath3 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the faint end slope of the m81 group is basically identical to that of @xcite .",
    "the faint end slope of schechter lf of m106 is slightly steeper than that of lg but flatter by @xmath85 compared to the m81 group .",
    "the cumulative lf of the m81 group rises suddenly at @xmath86 due to the inclusion of a large number of satellite galaxies found in megacam survey @xcite . a significantly larger number of satellite galaxies of the m81 group compared to m106 might be due to inclusion of some artifacts and/or background galaxies as pointed out by @xcite ( see the comments of their table 1 ) .",
    "they performed spectroscopic confirmation of only 3 bcd candidates among 22 new satellite candidates , which turned out to be the members of the m81 group .",
    "the cumulative lfs of lg and m106 satellite galaxies are represented well by the cumulative schechter function , while the cumulative schechter lf does not represent well the observed cumulative lf of the m81 group as shown in fig",
    ". the faint end slope of cumulative lf of m106 is much flatter than the expected faint end slope by @xmath87cdm model of @xmath88 ( trentham & tully , 2002 ) .    in fig .",
    "8 , we display @xmath89 colour - magnitude diagram of 16 satellite galaxies in m106 ( open circles with error bars ) .",
    "we transform sdss @xmath13 and @xmath10 magnitudes to johnson @xmath23 and @xmath82 magnitudes using the transformation relation by @xcite .",
    "since @xcite have observed the m81 group using only @xmath76-band , we show only the colour - magnitude distribution of m106 and lg satellites .",
    "the distribution in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for lg dwarf galaxies associated with neither mw nor m31 are shown as a comparison .",
    "the solid line is a boundary based on observations to divide the dwarf galaxies into early type galaxies of dsph or ellipticals ( redder of the solid line ) and late type galaxies of spirals or irregulars ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "the locations of dwarf satellite galaxies of m106 in the cmd coincide roughly with early type galaxies of m31 and mw .",
    "however the cmd distribution of lg dwarf galaxies not related with large spiral galaxies is quite different from that of m106 satellites .",
    "the mean colour of dwarf satellite galaxies of m106 is estimated to be @xmath90 , consistent with that of the dwarf satellite galaxies of mw and m31 .",
    "interestingly two brightest satellite galaxies of m106 ( s3 and s15 ) have much redder @xmath27 colour than the dwarf galaxies of mw with similar luminosity .",
    "this difference is related with the morphological difference between them .",
    "the brightest satellite galaxy of m106 is an early type spiral galaxy , while that of mw is a late type spiral .",
    "@xcite reported that it is quite rare to find star forming late type spiral galaxies as a satellite galaxy of a giant spiral galaxy like mw .",
    "however , there is a high probability of morphology conformity between host and satellite galaxies @xcite and similar conformity is present between a target galaxy and its companion , especially when the companion is close enough to be located inside the virial radius of the target galaxy @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the satellite galaxies in m106 shows two distinct features ; ( 1 ) galacto - centric concentration toward m106 and ( 2 ) preferred concentration toward the major axis of m106 .",
    "we compare the spatial distribution of the satellites of m106 to those of the dwarf satellite galaxies in lg and the m81 group and display the results in fig 9 .",
    "the galacto - centric cartesian coordinates of the satellite galaxies of milky way and m31 are from metz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and koch & grebel ( 2006 ) , respectively . to mimic the sky - projected two dimensional distribution of m106 ,",
    "we transform their cartesian coordinates by rotating along the semi - minor axis of the disk .",
    "we determine the inclination angle of m106 using the known major and minor - axis radii assuming zero - thickness of the disk of m106 following ma et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , obtaining @xmath91 .",
    "due to the limited survey area of the present study , the distribution of the satellite galaxies of m106 is truncated at @xmath92kpc , corresponding to @xmath93 .",
    "the surface number density profiles against the sky - projected galacto - centric distance ( fig .",
    "9(a ) ) are very similar to one another among four satellite systems with an indication of slightly higher number density of the satellite galaxies of the m81 group compared to mw , m31 , and m106 .",
    "the surface number density of the m81 group is higher by a factor of @xmath94 than that of lg satellite galaxies for for the radial ranges of @xmath95kpc .",
    "we fit the radial surface number density profiles of the satellites of mw , m31 , and the m81 group with the power - law , obtaining the power indices of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , respectively . for the brighter sample of the m81 group with @xmath99",
    ", we obtain the power index of @xmath100 . the radial surface number density profiles of the satellites of mw , m31 , and",
    "the m81 group decrease gradually roughly following the power - law with varying power indices . on the contrary , the radial distribution of satellites of m106 shows some hint of flat distribution for the outer region ( @xmath101kpc ) .",
    "m106 is expected to be located in rather denser environment than mw , m31 , and m81 , this might affect the distribution of satellite galaxies of m106 compared to those of mw , m31 . and the m81 group .",
    "however , since the number density profile of m106 satellites is only available for the radial ranges of @xmath102kpc , we are not able to conclude that if the outer distribution of m106 satellites follows the uniform distribution . to reconcile this issue ,",
    "it is need to extend the survey area to cover the whole dynamical boundary of m106 .",
    "we show the surface number density of the satellite galaxies of m106 , mw , m31 , and the m81 group with increasing projected distance from the semi - major axis of each galaxy in fig .",
    "the distributions of the satellite galaxies of these galaxies are similar within the uncertainties .",
    "we also compute the number of satellite galaxies of m106 by assuming that the flat distribution in fig .",
    "5(a ) ( @xmath103 arcmin ) is mainly due to background galaxies .",
    "we find that the number of satellite galaxies located between @xmath104 arcmin from m106 is @xmath105 by assuming flat background distribution",
    ". this number might be the lower limit of the actual satellite galaxies of m106 , corresponding to some half of candidate satellite galaxies found in this study .    to estimate the number of satellite galaxies of m106 located outside of the surveyed region ( @xmath106kpc ) of m106 , we count the number of satellite galaxies outward of this distance of mw , m31 , and the m81 group by assuming that the virial mass of each system is similar to each other .",
    "we find the numbers 4(@xmath107 ) , 8(@xmath108 ) , and 18(@xmath109 ) for mw , m31 , and the m81 group , respectively , with an average of 40% of total satellite galaxies in these galaxies .",
    "this simply implies that there might be @xmath110 satellite galaxies with @xmath111 in the outer region of m106 .",
    "this estimation might be an upper limit because the virial mass of m106 might be somewhat smaller than mw , m31 , and the m81 group and the catalogue of the satellite galaxies of the m81 group includes some very faint galaxies down to @xmath112 .",
    "we compute the expected number of satellite galaxies of m106 located beyond the surveyed region of m106 ( @xmath106kpc ) by extrapolating the measured power - law slope of @xmath41 , resulting in n(@xmath113kpc ) @xmath114 .",
    "this number is quite similar to that of m31 , but significantly lower than those of mw ( @xmath115 ) , and the m81 group(@xmath116 ) . thus , to find the expected number of satellite galaxies in m106 we need to increase the survey area by a factor of @xmath117 .",
    "we show the distribution of dwarf galaxies of m106 in @xmath118 versus disk scale length ( @xmath12 ) diagram in fig .",
    "10 ( open circles ) . for comparison the distribution of lg dwarf galaxies are shown with different symbols .",
    "we do not include the data for the m81 group because @xcite presented only the effective radii of the satellite galaxies .",
    "the scale length data for lg galaxies including spirals , dirr , and dsph are from @xcite .",
    "most of dwarf galaxies of m106 are scattered in the domain of the distribution of dsph of lg .",
    "s11 classified as dsph in this study has relatively large disk scale length than the other dsph galaxies with similar luminosity .",
    "late - type spiral satellite galaxies of m106 ( s2 , s3 and s4 ) are seen to lie well above the relation for dsph galaxies .",
    "overall the distribution of dwarf galaxies in m106 is very similar to that of dirr and dsph of lg in this diagram .",
    "we present the result of a wide - area survey for satellite galaxies around m106 .",
    "our survey is based on the large field deep @xmath13 and @xmath10 images obtained using the cfht megacam so that we could perform a systematic searching for satellite galaxies of m106 .",
    "we summarize the main conclusions of the present study as follows .",
    "\\1 . based on @xmath0 deep observations of m106",
    ", we found 16 candidate satellite galaxies of m106 , located as far as @xmath92kpc from the centre of m106 .",
    "four of them are new findings . due to the limited exposure times and the large atmospheric seeing we are able to detect only a small number of trgb stars in the satellite galaxies of m106",
    ". our survey area might be significantly smaller than the physical boundary of m106 dark halo .",
    "therefore we might miss several satellite galaxies outside of @xmath119kpc from m106 .",
    "a satellite system of m106 shows a clear signature of central concentration toward m106 and is more concentrated toward the semi - major axis of m106 .",
    "we fit the inner region of the radial surface number density profiles with a power - law , resulting a power index of @xmath2 , similar to that of the isothermal distribution .",
    "the surface brightnesses of 15 satellites galaxies are found to fit well with an exponential profile while the remaining brightest satellite galaxy of m106 ( s15 ) shows a radial profile of the typical early type galaxy .",
    "the luminosity of 16 satellite galaxies spans a large range ( @xmath120 mag ) , but @xmath27 colours have a mean value of 0.73 with a small dispersion .",
    "the luminosity function of the satellite galaxies of m106 is well represented by the schechter function with a faint end slope of @xmath121 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the satellite galaxies of m106 , milky way , m31 , and the m81 group is found to be similar to one another .",

    "<S> we present a wide field survey of satellite galaxies in m106 ( ngc 4258 ) covering a @xmath0 field around m106 using canada - france - hawaii telescope / megacam . </S>",
    "<S> we find 16 satellite galaxy candidates of m106 . </S>",
    "<S> eight of these galaxies are found to be dwarf galaxies that are much smaller and fainter than the remaining galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> four of these galaxies are new findings . </S>",
    "<S> surface brightness profiles of 15 out of 16 satellite galaxies can be represented well by an exponential disk profile with varying scale length . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the surface number density distribution of these satellite galaxies . the central number density profile ( d @xmath1 kpc ) </S>",
    "<S> is well fitted by a power - law with a power index of @xmath2 , similar to the expected power index of isothermal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity function of these satellites is represented well by the schechter function with a faint end slope of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> integrated photometric properties ( total luminosity , total colour , and disk scale length ) and the spatial distribution of these satellite galaxies are found to be roughly similar to those of the milky way and m31 .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath18 categories for surface brightness profiles and central surface brightness as described in  3.2 .      </S>",
    "<S> we display the radial surface brightness profiles of all the satellite galaxies of m106 in fig . 3 , and list the results of surface photometry including @xmath19 colour gradient in table 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial profiles of surface magnitude in @xmath13 and @xmath10 bands are displayed in open circles and open squares , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we marked the position of the effective radius ( @xmath20 ) within which half of the total galaxy luminosity is emitted by thin arrows , together with the positions of two characteristic radii , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , by the vertical solid lines and the vertical dotted lines . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined as the radii where the @xmath23-band surface brightness becomes @xmath24 mag arcsec@xmath5 and @xmath25 mag arcsec@xmath5 , respectively .    most of the satellite galaxies of m106 show surface brightness profiles typical of a disk galaxy , while the surface brightness profiles of s15 resemble those of an elliptical galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> surface brightnesses of three satellite galaxies s6 , s11 , and s14 are extremely low so that we could not determine the two characteristic radii , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 for these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these low surface brightness galaxies are expected to be an analogy of sextans and sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group . </S>",
    "<S> radial surface brightness profiles of the satellite galaxies , s7 , s9 , and s16 show a strong signature of the presence of the central nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the radial surface brightness profile of s7 near the galaxy centre is found to be very close to that of the point source profile , implying the presence of the central nucleus . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the central structures of s9 and s16 are slightly extended compared with the typical point source profile .    </S>",
    "<S> we fit the derived radial surface brightness profiles with a single exponential law ( thin solid lines over data points ) except for s15 , for which we use the de vaucouleures law . </S>",
    "<S> the physical properties of the satellite galaxies of m106 derived by fitting the radial surface brightness profiles are listed in table 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial surface brightness profiles of the outer regions of the satellite galaxies of m106 are fitted well by an exponential profile . however , near the galaxy centre there are seen a variety of structures . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the satellite galaxies of m106 with exponential disk into 4 categories based on their central surface brightness profiles : ( 1 ) galaxies with surface brightness profiles represented well by a single exponential law ( s8 and s12 ) , ( 2 ) galaxies expected to host a clear / marginal central nucleus ( s7 , s9 , and s16 ) , ( 3 ) satellite galaxies showing brighter central surface brightness than the exponential law but more extended than the psf ( s3 , s4 , s5 , s11 , and s13 ) , and ( 4 ) galaxies with fainter central brightness than the exponential disk profiles ( s1 , s2 , s6 , s10 and s14 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the central structures of the satellite galaxies in category 3 might be explained by the presence of the central bulge in these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the appearances of these galaxies are , however , quite different from one another . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , two galaxies , s5 and s10 , showing typical shapes of disk edge have quite different central structure .    </S>",
    "<S> we present the derived radial @xmath19 colour profiles of the satellite galaxies of m106 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . for clear appearance </S>",
    "<S> we apply the box car smoothing kernel to the data ( solid lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 surface colour of the satellite galaxies ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 mag arcsec@xmath5 , corresponding to 0.2 and 1.2 mag arcsec@xmath5 in @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the expected foreground reddening toward m106 is negligible ( @xmath28 , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the radial colour profiles of 16 satellite galaxies using the same scale in y - axis for clear comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the colour gradient of @xmath19 colour profiles of these galaxies and summarized the results in table 4 . for the linear fit of the surface colour profile </S>",
    "<S> we only include the data in the intermediate radial range as summarized in table 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the surface colour profiles of s3 and s15 get bluer with increasing radius , while those of s5 and s13 get redder as radius increases . </S>",
    "<S> the radial surface colour profiles of remaining 12 galaxies do not show any clear signature of colour gradient . despite the similar trend in the radial surface brightness profiles , the colour profiles of s3 and s5 differ clearly : slow increase in @xmath19 colour with increasing radius near the central region followed by a slower decrease ( getting bluer ) for s3 , but the trend is quite opposite for s5 . </S>",
    "<S> the marginally visible resolved stars in s5 might indicate the presence of young ms stars and/or agb stars , which are brighter than the tip of the red giant branch stars . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the recent star formation in s5 . for three galaxies ( s6 , s11 , and s14 ) with extremely low surface brightness </S>",
    "<S> , we found no trend in the colour profiles due to the large photometric errors .      </S>",
    "<S> the two dimensional distribution of the 16 satellite galaxies of m106 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) shows ( 1 ) the central concentration of the satellite galaxies toward m106 and ( 2 ) the higher probability to find satellite galaxies along the major axis of m106 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate these features in more detail using quantitative analysis as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we show one dimensional spatial distributions of the 16 satellite galaxies in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . fig . 5 ( a ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) present the surface number density profiles as a function of the projected distance from the centre of m106 and from the major axis of m106 . </S>",
    "<S> both profiles show clear signatures of concentration toward the centre of m106 and toward the major axis of m106 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the radial number density profile of the satellite galaxies using a power - law for the radial range of @xmath29 arcmin , finding a power index of @xmath30 . a power index of a power - law profile for fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(c ) is @xmath31 much flatter compared to the power index for galacto - centric radial distribution ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the derived power - law index for the galacto - centric surface number density profile is very similar to the expected value for isothermal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that 12 of 16 candidate satellite galaxies with @xmath32 arcmin ( @xmath33 kpc ) found in this study are probably genuine satellite galaxies of m106 .    </S>",
    "<S> because we are dealing with small number statistics ( @xmath34 ) , the derived power index of power - law for the number density profiles might be affected significantly by the binning method . </S>",
    "<S> to examine the effect of binning for the number density profiles we derive the number density profiles using four different binning methods ; ( 1 ) an equal number of data points in each bin , ( 2 ) binning the data points in an equal linear interval , ( 3 ) binning the data points in an equal logarithmic interval , and ( 4 ) binning the data points in an equal @xmath35 interval . </S>",
    "<S> we applied four different binning methods to obtain the radial number density profiles of 16 satellite galaxies of m106 . </S>",
    "<S> we then , fit the data with @xmath36 arcmin to the power - law for the each density profile , obtaining power indices of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> all of the power indices agree well within the errors , and the derived power - index ( @xmath41 ) is close to the weighted mean of the values .    </S>",
    "<S> the satellite galaxies in the outer region ( @xmath42 kpc ) show more or less like a flat distribution rather than the power - law . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the radial number density profile of the satellites including the galaxies in the outer region of m106 ( @xmath43 kpc ) , obtaining a power index of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this is somewhat shallower than the power index for the radial number density profile of 12 satellite galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however due to the large uncertainty it is quite uncertain whether the satellite distribution of the outer region of m106 is flat or not . </S>",
    "<S> one of the causes for the flat distribution of m106 satellite located at the outer region may be the inclusion of the background galaxies in the list of the m106 satellite galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . 5 ( b ) and ( d ) </S>",
    "<S> show the cumulative number distribution of satellite galaxies against the projected distance from the centre of m106 , and that of the projected distance from the major axis of m106 , respectively ( solid lines ) . for comparison we display the expected cumulative number distribution of 16 artificial sources assuming spatially uniform distribution with shaded regions . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the shaded regions represents @xmath45 boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the concentrated distribution of the satellite galaxies toward the centre of m106 is also shown clearly with a high statistical confidence ( @xmath46 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the outer region ( @xmath47 arcmin ) the observed distribution of the satellite galaxies is very similar to that of the uniform distribution ( this is also observed in fig . 5 ( a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the central concentration toward the centre of m106 , they are located preferentially along the major axis of m106 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a large portion of the satellite galaxies of m106 were formed around m106 and are captured by m106 moving along the merging filaments , which are spatially aligned with the major axis of m106 . </S>"
