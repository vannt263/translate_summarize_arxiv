    "correlation and interference distinguish quantum from classical physics .",
    "the former is manifest in the measurement of many - body coincidences predicted by a quantum joint probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "some observable correlations can not be realized classically @xcite .",
    "quantum interference is most familiar as a one - body pdf for an outcome that can be achieved in at least two indistinguishable ways .",
    "however , it can also be generated by superposing many - body states in indistinguishable ways @xcite .",
    "a many - body interferometer is more difficult to treat since it is possible to measure correlations in the probability of finding each particle at different positions _ and _ times .",
    "it differs from a one - body interferometer primarily in its beamsplitting mechanism . here ,",
    "correlation and interference are combined in asynchronous correlation interferometry of a bipartite system , using measurement of one substate as the beamsplitter for the other .",
    "experimental confirmation of quantum correlation has involved photons @xcite , atoms @xcite , and josephson phase qubits @xcite .",
    "however , there is little experimental evidence of correlated interference between massive particles .    analysis of correlated systems usually begins with an expression for the many - body state after it has been prepared by an interaction .",
    "for bipartite systems this is routinely done with photon pairs from parametric downconversion .",
    "the extremes of either a few or a large number of particles are most often treated . in the former case",
    "the analysis typically involves a simultaneous correlation between the positions @xcite or angular momenta of two particles @xcite .",
    "the formalism often deals only with identical particles . here",
    "a mechanism is describe which generates interferometric correlations between distinguishable particles , which can be of disparate masses .",
    "the issue of non - simultaneous correlations is explored here in the context of perhaps the simplest quantum correlation possible : a particle reflecting elastically from a mirror , both of which are distinguishable .",
    "the mirror and particle have non - zero rest mass and motion is in free space along one dimension , with all states unbound .",
    "measurements of particle reflection , but not associated with correlated interference , have involved mirrors that reflect atoms @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite , atoms reflecting from a solid surface @xcite , neutrons @xcite and atoms @xcite reflecting from vibrating mirrors , and atoms reflecting from a switchable mirror @xcite .",
    "consider first the particle and mirror in uncorrelated eigenstates of energy before reflection , referred to as the ` incident harmonic state ' .",
    "the energy eigenstate after reflection , referred to as the ` reflected harmonic state ' , results in correlation between the particle and mirror via conservation of energy and momentum : an energy or momentum measurement of the reflected particle yields a correlated energy or momentum measurement of the mirror when given the incident harmonic state .",
    "superposing such states yields the incident and reflected particle - mirror wavegroups .",
    "these differ from the harmonic states in that a measurement of the energy ( or position ) of the particle does not uniquely constrain the energy ( or position ) of the mirror since the reflected particle - mirror wavegroup is not in an eigenstate of the energy ( or position ) operator .",
    "such incident and reflected wavegroup particle - mirror states interfere when they overlap .",
    "this is similar to the transient one - body interference of an electromagnetic wavegroup reflecting from a stationary mirror @xcite .",
    "however , classically the mirror experiences only a continuous force due to radiation pressure .",
    "quantum mechanically , interference occurs since the incident and reflected states are indistinguishable for a measurement of position ( but not for a momentum measurement ) .",
    "interference is expected between the incident and reflected particle substates _ along with _ interference of the mirror substates which have and have not reflected the particle .",
    "their correlation is perhaps not expected , being a consequence of the solution to the schrdinger equation from which a joint pdf is constructed .",
    "the correlations in the two - body interference are manifest as coincidence rates , e.g. a correlation in the _ simultaneous _ measurement of particle and mirror positions .",
    "this two - body wavefunction is then modified to incorporate predictions for measurement of the particle first and then later that of the mirror , using the copenhagen interpretation of measurement in quantum mechanics .",
    "the resulting pdf is a function both of the different particle positions and different times at which each is measured .",
    "an assumption used is that between the times of the two measurements , there is neither interaction between the particle and mirror nor with the environment .",
    "the focus of the discussion is on asynchronous correlated interference . in this case , a measurement of only the particle in the correlated interference region splits the mirror substate into ones which have and have not reflected the particle .",
    "later measurement of the mirror reveals this interference .",
    "[ fig : overview ] is a schematic representation of this state splitting process .",
    "actual two - body pdfs are shown in later sections .",
    "the particle pdf before interaction is the gaussian at @xmath0 , moving to the right at speed @xmath1 , while the mirror is represented as the black rectangle , moving to the right at speed @xmath2 . at @xmath3 interference between the incident and reflected particle substates is shown as oscillations in its pdf while interference between the mirror substates which have and have not reflected the particle is represented by the rectangular checkerboard pattern rather than the solid rectangle .",
    "this then is a region of correlated interference , although in this schematic the correlation can not be illustrated . for simplicity ,",
    "speeds are not shown in this and the next snapshot .",
    "measurement of the particle but not the mirror is represented by the ` photon ' coming from below , interacting with the particle , and then being measured by the detector above at time @xmath4 .",
    "more details on this aspect of the process are given in section [ sec : measurementtheory ] .",
    "the lower two schematics illustrate the states with and without this measurement , using the lower and upper halves of each schematic , respectively . without measurement ,",
    "the particle wavegroup reflects from the mirror and continues to move to the right with reduced speed while the speed of the mirror increases . without measurement ,",
    "the correlated interference disappears when the wavegroups no longer overlap as illustrated when @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , only the mirror state which reflects the particle survives ( as is illustrated in the upper half of the @xmath5 schematic ) . this is a consequence of the complete particle wavegroup having reflected .    a noise - free and non - destructive measurement of only the particle , however , collapses the particle substate as shown in the lower portion of the @xmath6 schematic , with @xmath7 .",
    "yet the mirror remains in a superposition state . at time @xmath5",
    "the two mirror states have separated a distance greater than the wavegroup size due to their different speeds and are then represented by solid rectangles .",
    "although there is then no interference , the mirror remains in a superposition of having both reflected and not reflected the particle for all later times .",
    "this splitting is similar to a beamsplitter producing photon states which traverse spatially separate and therefore distinguishable paths .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the particle state after measurement spreads , as shown in the lower portion of the @xmath5 schematic . it is assumed that this spreading wavegroup does not interact with the split mirror states for times @xmath8 .        to determine the consequences of such measurements , a two - body solution of the schrdinger equation for simultaneous measurement",
    "is first obtained for the particle - mirror system by applying standard techniques to derive the energy eigenstates .",
    "this is used to construct the asynchronous two - body wavefunction .",
    "wavegroups are formed from a superposition of these solutions .",
    "particular emphasis is given to correlated interference or the overlap region of the incident and reflected particle - mirror wavegroups .",
    "a marginal pdf is illustrated , using an example of interference for the particle when the mirror is not measured , which yields an analog of the doppler effect for the interference of light in retro - reflection from a moving mirror .",
    "the remainder of the paper deals predominately with issues which illustrate the unique properties of asynchronous correlation interferometry , which are most easily understood using the example of a microscopic particle reflecting from a mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror .",
    "this example is not intended as a practical experimental proposal .",
    "rather , observation of asynchronous correlations will more likely first occur with a microscopic particle reflecting from a `` microscopic '' mirror .",
    "the particle - mirror interaction is modeled as a moving delta function potential where reflection is assumed to occur at the center of mass of the mirror with the schrdinger equation given by @xmath9+i\\partial_{t})\\psi=0 , \\label{eq : schreqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where square brackets are used to indicate the argument of a function and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the particle and mirror positions along the x - axis .",
    "the mirror reflectivity , related to @xmath12 , goes to infinity for a lossless mirror .    the standard separable solution to this equation results from a center of mass ( cm ) and relative ( rel ) transformation of the particle - mirror system ( not to be confused with the cm of the particle or mirror ) .",
    "this does not change the total energy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the wavevectors for the particle and mirror with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , masses @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and initial velocities @xmath1 and @xmath20 , respectively . the transformed schrdinger equation becomes @xmath21 \\notag + i\\partial_{t})\\psi[x_{cm},x_{rel},t]=0 \\label{eq : scheqncm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",

    "an example of this procedure is found in the solution to the hydrogen atom where the schrdinger equation is first transformed from the laboratory to the cm - relative coordinates yielding _ uncorrelated _ substates .",

    "coefficients of these time parameters in the phase are then the energies of the particle and mirror , respectively .",

    "[ eq : schreqn ] to transform it into the cm and rel system . since that transformation yielded a simultaneous pdf",
    "there was no need for the two - time notation . to modify it for asynchronous predictions ,",
    "relative and cm times are introduced in subsection [ sec : non - simultaneous ] , which then both account for different temporal measurements of the cm and relative positions and isolate the cm and rel energy terms .",
    "however , transformation to the cm - rel system is simply a mathematical technique to facilitate a solution to the schrdinger equation .",
    "for example , there exists no observable particle with a reduced mass as described in the cm - rel system .",
    "once a solution , which satisfies the initial conditions and boundary values , is obtained in the cm - rel system the inverse transformation is applied to describe the system that can be measured .",
    "these time parameters provide labels for the particle and mirror energies in the wavefunction s phase and also label the different times at which the particle and mirror are measured .",
    "they assist in isolating the energy of the particle from that of the mirror , just as @xmath10 and @xmath11 isolate the effect of the particle and mirror wavevectors in the phase of the wavefunction .",
    "this then allows all particle parameters to be fixed in the two - body wavefunction when the particle is measured .",
    "such labeling , while simple in a separable system , is not trivial in the correlated particle - mirror system .",
    "the different time labels do not indicate evolution of the subsystems via different hamiltonians as do the different time variables used by mcguire @xcite nor are they used to generate a manifestly lorentz invariant theory as done by petrat @xcite .",
    "they neither tick at different rates nor are they out of phase , but rather act as only a label , just as @xmath10 and @xmath11 label the particle and mirror spatial coordinates along the @xmath33 axis .",

    "measurement is irrelevant to the subsequent time evolution of the mirror since they are no longer correlated and no longer interact .",
    "the mirror state is determined by fixing all the particle coordinates in the two - body wavefunction at the time of the measurement of the particle .",
    "the two time formalism facilitates this procedure by fixing the particle parameters while allowing only those of the mirror to time evolve .",

    "for example , the phase of the mirror substate evolves in time only with the mirror s energy times the time @xmath31 .",
    "the particle s energy times the time @xmath4 term in the phase should not influence the time evolution of the mirror substate after the particle has been measured .",

    "not shown ) , all of which still partially overlap spatially with this middle snapshot , the envelope of the pdf waveform moves through the @xmath104 plane , yet the maxima and minima of the fringes for these different snapshots remains in the same location .",
    "the doppler shift for the particle - mirror system , analogous to a classical wave reflecting from a moving mirror , involves only measuring the particle flux at a fixed position with no measurement of the mirror .",
    "not measuring the mirror involves averaging the two - body pdf ( trace ) over the mirror coordinates .",
    "the mirror coherence length determines if this averaging `` washes - out '' the interference .",
    "an example , for the synchronous case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spreadvelocity ] ( a ) .",
    "however , a smaller mirror coherence length results in a pdf which , when averaged over @xmath11 , maintains the interference along @xmath10 , as is illustrated in fig . [ fig : spreadvelocity ] ( c ) .",
    "the pdf for simultaneous correlation , with a coherence length associated with that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spreadvelocity ] ( c ) , then generates only static interference and not the expected time dependent interference effect associated with the doppler shift",
    ".    however , as shown in subsections [ subsec : beat ] and [ subsec : trace ] , the two - time formalism predicts a doppler interference effect similar to that classically when measuring only the particle , but only as a special case ( for certain coherence lengths ) of a more general result .",
    "this is a consequence of using the two - time formalism to parse the total energy and therefore the frequency of the wavefunction into terms associated with the particle and mirror rather than only using the expression for the total energy .",
    "interference in a typical one - body interferometer ` washes - out ' as the fringe spacing becomes imperceptible with increasing mass .",
    "another mechanism that eliminates interference is a measurement to determine along which path the object traveled through the interferometer .",
    "the former issue is mitigated using two - body reflection of a microscopic particle from a mesoscopic / macroscopic object , as described above , while the latter is the first topic of this section .",
    "a method to determine path information and therefore destroy interference utilizes a ` heisenberg microscope , ' where an additional particle scatters from the object traversing the interferometer .",
    "if the wavelength of this particle , @xmath175 , is smaller than the spatial separation along the two paths , @xmath169 , then path information can be obtained in principle from the state of this scattered probe particle and interference is destroyed .",
    "this was verified using a three grating mach - zehnder interferometer traversed by an atom and using a photon as the probe to determine path information @xcite .",
    "the contrast of the interference , as a function of @xmath169 , was shown to drop dramatically for @xmath176 .",
    "generating such decoherence for particle - mirror interference involves using a probe particle to determine the position of the mirror during interference ( after measurement of the particle ) .",
    "there are two distances that the mirror could have moved : that associated with and that without reflection . if the probe particle can resolve the difference in these distances then the ` path ' associated with reflection is distinguishable from that without reflection .    for a synchronous measurement of a near stationary mirror with @xmath82 and @xmath177 ,",
    "the mean difference in these mirror distances is @xmath178 , which when equal to the wavelength of a probe particle of mass @xmath179 then requires that the probe have velocity @xmath180 . for asynchronous measurement @xmath181 requiring a probe velocity @xmath182 , where @xmath183 .",
    "this calculation can also be used to approximate the effect of such decoherence on the mirror from the collisions with gas atoms forming the thermal bath which surrounds the mirror if these gas atoms are considered to be the probe which determines path information and they scatter from only one of the superposed mirror states .",
    "the interference in reflection described above is then maintained if there is a small probability of these atoms having the velocity @xmath184 .",
    "for a mesoscopic mirror , @xmath185 kg , and both microscopic particle and probe atoms of mass @xmath186 kg , @xmath187 m / s .",
    "atoms with such thermal speeds are not likely to be found in a low temperature gas .",
    "this decoherence mechanism can also be applied to the emission of three examples are used by the mirror during interference . if the photon s wavelength is small enough to allow for the location of the slab associated with one of these positions , interference is destroyed since it",
    "can then be determined at which position the reflection occurred @xcite . for an ultra cold atom reflecting from a mirror of mass @xmath188 kg , @xmath181 , requiring a wavelength of @xmath189 m for @xmath190 s.",
    "the probability of such a thermal photon emission is small .",
    "however , for such a probe to destroy mirror interference it must interact with only one of the mirror states ( how this could be accomplished with closely spaced mirror states is not obvious ) . if not , then the probe ( with a coherence length longer than the separation of the mirror states ) itself is placed into a superposition state of having interacted with both mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror states .",
    "this results in probe interference , which can be used as a method to determine that the mirror is in a superposition state , as discussed in section [ sec : measuring ] ,    these calculations indicate that decoherence associated with obtaining path information can be mitigated with a judicious choice of parameters .",
    "this is due in part to the displacements associated with the interfering mirror substates being proportional to @xmath191 . to measure such small displacements",
    "requires probe particles with proportionally smaller wavelengths which are typically not found in the environment .",
    "another decoherence mechanism is through coupling with the many degrees of freedom of the surrounding environment .",
    "zurek @xcite predicted exponential decay of the off - diagonal density matrix element terms for a mesoscopic / macroscopic object in a superposition state , @xmath192 $ ] , with time constant @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the thermal relaxation time , @xmath169 is the difference in distance between these two states , and @xmath195 is the thermal de broglie wavelength of the mesoscopic / macroscopic object . the decay is into a mixed rather than a pure state .    applying this decoherence model to the mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror states after measurement of the particle , as described above , yields @xmath196 .",
    "reflection of an atom from a mirror of mass @xmath197 kg at @xmath153 k yields @xmath198 for @xmath190 s. however , @xmath194 can vary dramatically depending on environmental and material properties along with the dimensional values of the mirror .",
    "macroscopic yet small masses can have short thermal relaxation times .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that environmental decoherence of the mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror states generated from asynchronous measurement can be made either negligible or non - negligible in this model of decoherence .",
    "this decoherence time was derived to show that mesoscopic / macroscopic bodies in superposition states quickly decohere .",
    "therefore , any interference due to such superposition should not be observed . on the other hand ,",
    "asynchronous measurement generates a superposition of macroscopic mirror states which mitigate this environmental decoherence , due to their small spatial separation .",
    "it has been shown that correlated interference for a microscopic particle reflecting from a mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror , does not disappear with increasing mirror mass , is difficult to eliminate via a path measurement , and can be made insensitive to environmental decoherence .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the robust character of interference for objects with many degrees of freedom is reinforced by measurements which demonstrate that even if the size of the object is larger than both the coherence length and debroglie wavelength , interference can still be observed @xcite .",
    "a third particle , reflecting from the mirror after asynchronous measurement , can act as a probe to confirm that the mirror is in a superposition state .",
    "such reflection is again described by a two - body wavefunction , if the measurement of the initial particle has eliminated this particle from interacting with both the split mirror states and the probe .",
    "the result is then a sum of two - body solutions to the schrdinger equation , one for the probe reflecting from each mirror state .",
    "wavegroups are then formed from these harmonic states as described above .",
    "the interference in reflection of these two - body wavegroups is robust since overlap is maintained as they both travel in the same direction . measuring the probe , without any measurement of the mirror ,",
    "does not destroy the probe interference for sufficiently small mirror coherence lengths , as described in subsection [ sec : asynchdoppler ] .",
    "therefore , the more difficult correlation measurement of both the probe and mirror need not be performed .    the coherence length of the probe need only be larger than the very small displacement of the mirror states for this probe interference to be exhibited , while the phase difference between these probe states is determined by the mass of the probe . with such interference",
    ", the probe can not distinguish between the mirror states as discussed in section [ sec : path ] .",
    "verification of interference from only the reflected probe is then a method to measure the mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror in a superposition state , without any ` direct ' measurement of the mirror .",
    "details of such a calculation are beyond the scope of this foundational work .",
    "asynchronous measurement in quantum mechanics has been treated for a particle reflecting from a mirror .",
    "the results presented assume measurement of the particle first , collapse of the particle substate , and a later measurement of the mirror while no particle - mirror interaction occurs between the times of these measurements .",
    "the two - body schrdinger equation , solved with standard techniques , is parsed to completely separate the variables associated with the particle from those of the mirror , so that when the particle is measured only its parameters are fixed while those of the mirror can continue to evolve in time until the mirror is measured .",
    "the subsequent interference of the mirror states which have and have not reflected the particle is in many ways familiar from examples in quantum mechanics in which an outcome can be achieved in indistinguishable ways . yet this process of splitting differs by using measurement as its mechanism .",
    "this is not possible in a one - body system . in addition , the example used here of a microscopic particle reflecting from a mesoscopic or macroscopic mirror illustrates why these interference effects do not vanish with increasing mirror mass .    _ without _ such measurement , the two - body wavegroup time evolves into one in which the wavegroup has completely reflected and then no longer overlaps with the incident wavegroup .",
    "correlated interference then disappears since there is then no uncertainty about the particle and mirror belonging to the incident or reflected states .",
    "correlated interference in reflection is an example of one of the simplest interferometers , utilizing neither division of amplitude nor division of wavefront methods to generate interference .",
    "in addition , path lengths need not be carefully matched for interference to be manifest .",
    "the complexity of _ asynchronous _ correlated interferometry is revealed as the coherence lengths of the particle and mirror substates are varied .",
    "examples are : ( 1 ) when both are small then essentially classical reflection results .",
    "measurement of the particle either occurs after _ or _ before reflection , resulting in a later measurement of the mirror either having recoiled _ or _ not recoiled .",
    "( 2 ) when both are large , compared with the particle s wavelength , then measurement of the particle in the correlated interference region acts as a beamsplitter generating mirror states which have _ and _ have not reflected the particle .",
    "( 3 ) measurement of the particle only , for short mirror and long particle coherence lengths , yields the expected interference due to the doppler effect but only as a special case of a more general result .",
    "other issues of asynchronous measurements presented include : transfer of coherence between the particle and mirror , the effects of substate coherence on asynchronous interference , distortion of the two - body wavegroups due to reflection , interference effects on mesoscopic / macroscopic mirrors , and the prolonging of interference of the mirror substate when the particle is measured first in the region of correlated interference .",
    "finally , the superposition of mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror states was shown to be insensitive to environmental decoherence .",
    "some consequences of asynchronous measurements not presented include : multiple sequential particle measurements before a measurement of the mirror ( two - body quantum zeno effect ) , treatment of asynchronous measurement in other interpretations of quantum mechanics , two - body effects for spatially varying potentials , reflection of a massless particle , dealing with an inelastic collision , and both synchronous and asynchronous two - body treatment of quantum tunneling .",
    "perhaps the one modification which would result in a more familiar interferometer is to incorporate a partially transmitting , rather than totally reflecting , mirror .",
    "one example is of a thin aluminum slab whose two surfaces partially retro - reflect a neutron .",
    "this then leads to a two - body interferometer analogous to the one - body thin - film interference of light .",
    "finally , the more likely domain in which these prediction will be tested is in the reflection of a microscopic particle from a microscopic `` mirror , '' the details of which have also not been discussed .",
    "there is little experimental support for asynchronous correlation interferometry .",
    "yet , it involves perhaps the most elementary of only a few exact solutions to the two - body schrdinger equation .",
    "it is surprising that such theoretical simplicity is not reflected experimentally .",
    "measurement in quantum mechanics plays a role different from that in any other physical theory and its interpretation remains controversial .",
    "it is shown here that measurement can act as a beamsplitter , which , under the appropriate conditions , can prolong the transient interference associated with reflection in a two - body quantum system .",
    "although far from being comprehensive , these results also indicate a direction , heretofore unexplored , for further research in understanding asynchronous quantum correlation , probing decoherence , and extending quantum measurements to larger masses .",
    "the authors would like to thank professors c. durfee and j. scales for useful comments , along with referee guidance .",
    "without collapse the two - body wavefunction , expressed in terms of the two times , evolves and conserves probability .",
    "the probability of measuring the particle at @xmath56 and the mirror at @xmath57 is given by @xmath199 dx_{1 } dx_{2}$ ] with the joint pdf determined by the solution of equation [ eq : schreqn ] as @xmath200 but expressed in terms of the two time variables in the particle - mirror system .",
    "using this equation , conservation of probability can then be expressed locally as , @xmath201 + \\partial_{t_{2 } } pdf[x_{1},t_{1},x_{2},t_{2 } ] + \\notag \\\\ \\partial_{x_{1 } } j_{1}[x_{1},t_{1},x_{2},t_{2 } ] + \\partial_{x_{2 } } j_{2}[x_{1},t_{1},x_{2},t_{2}]=0 , \\label{eq : consprob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath202=\\hbar ( \\psi^ { * } \\partial_{x_{1 } } \\psi-\\psi \\partial_{x_{1 } } \\psi^{*})/(2 i m)$ ] and @xmath203=\\hbar ( \\psi^ { * } \\partial_{x_{2 } } \\psi-\\psi \\partial_{x_{2 } } \\psi^{*})/(2 i m)$ ] . while the expressions for these current densities appear similar to that for one particle systems there are subtle but important differences for a two body system @xcite .",
    "multiplying equation [ eq : consprob ] by @xmath204 , integrating over the segment from @xmath205 to @xmath206 along the x - axis ( @xmath207 and @xmath208 ) , and then rearranging terms yields a solution to equation [ eq : consprob ] if @xmath209 dx_{1 } + \\notag \\\\",
    "j_{1}[b , t_{1},x_{2},t_{2}]-j_{1}[a , t_{1},x_{2},t_{2}]=0 \\notag \\label{eq : consprob2a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath210 dx_{2 } + \\notag \\\\",
    "j_{2}[x_{1},t_{1},b , t_{2}]-j_{2}[x_{1},t_{1},a , t_{2}]=0   \\notag .",
    "\\label{eq : consprob2b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations indicate that the time rate of change of probability within the @xmath211 segment on the x - axis is determined separately by a net change in particle and mirror probability fluxes in that region , which is similar to conservation of probability in a one - body system . now",
    ", however , probability of the two - body system is conserved for the mirror even when @xmath10 and @xmath4 are fixed .",
    "the asynchronous procedure described here therefore maintains conservation of probability for the mirror after the particle has been measured .",
