    "is a borel measure @xmath1 on a metric space @xmath0 fully determined by its values on balls ? in the context of general measure theory , such a question appears to be of extremely basic nature .",
    "the answer ( when it is known ) strongly depends upon the interplay between the measure and the metric space . a clear overview on the subject is given in @xcite .",
    "let us mention some known facts about this issue .",
    "when @xmath5 equipped with a norm , the answer to the above question is in the affirmative .",
    "the reason is the following : if two radon measures @xmath1 and @xmath6 coincide on every ball @xmath7 , then in particular they are mutually absolutely continuous , therefore by the radon - nikodym - lebesgue differentiation theorem one has @xmath8 for any borel set @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath6 ( defined for @xmath6-almost all @xmath11 ) . more generally , the same fact can be shown for any pair of borel measures on a finite - dimensional banach space @xmath3 . unfortunately , the differentiation theorem is valid on a banach space @xmath3 if and only if @xmath3 is finite - dimensional . of course , this does not prevent in general the possibility that borel measures are uniquely determined by their values on balls .",
    "indeed , preiss and ti@xmath12 proved in @xcite that in separable banach spaces , two finite borel measures coinciding on all balls also coincide on all borel sets .",
    "nevertheless , if this coincidence turns out to be satisfied only on balls of radius , say , less than @xmath13 , then the question still stands . in the case of",
    "separable metric spaces , federer introduced in @xcite a geometrical condition on the distance ( see definition [ def : federer ] ) implying a besicovitch - type covering lemma that can be used to show the property above , i.e. , that any finite borel measure is uniquely identified by its values on closed balls .",
    "when this condition on the distance is dropped , some examples of metric spaces and of pairs of distinct borel measures coinciding on balls of upper - bounded diameter are known ( see @xcite ) .",
    "here we consider the case of a separable metric space @xmath0 where besicovitch covering lemma ( or at least some generalized version of it ) holds , and we ask the following questions :    [ question_1]_how can we reconstruct a borel measure from its values on balls , and especially , what about the case of signed measures ? _    a classical approach to construct a measure from a given _ premeasure _ @xmath14 defined on a family @xmath15 of subsets of @xmath3 ( here the premeasure @xmath14 is defined on closed balls ) is to apply carathodory constructions ( method i and method ii , see @xcite ) to obtain an outer measure .",
    "we recall that a premeasure @xmath14 is a nonnegative function , defined on a given family @xmath15 of subsets of @xmath3 , such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 . by method",
    "i , an outer measure @xmath18 is defined starting from @xmath14 as @xmath19 for any @xmath20 .",
    "but , as it is explained in @xcite ( section @xmath21 ) , method i does not take into account that @xmath3 is a metric space , thus the resulting outer measure can be incompatible with the metric on @xmath3 , in the sense that open sets are not necessarily @xmath18-measurable . on the other hand , method ii is used to define hausdorff measures ( see theorem  [ thm_caratheodory_construction ] ) and it always produces a metric outer measure @xmath22 , for which borel sets are @xmath18-measurable .",
    "as for a signed measure @xmath23 , the main problem is that , given a closed ball @xmath24 , it is impossible to directly reconstruct @xmath25 and @xmath26 from @xmath27 .",
    "the idea is , then , to apply carathodory s construction to the premeasure @xmath28 ( here @xmath29 denotes the positive part of @xmath30 ) and check that the resulting outer measure is actually @xmath31 .",
    "then , by a similar argument we recover @xmath32 .",
    "now we consider the problem of reconstructing a measure @xmath1 from approximate values on balls .",
    "we thus assume that a premeasure @xmath2 , defined on closed balls , is given and satisfies the following two properties : for some @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 holds for all @xmath37 and all @xmath38 .",
    "[ question_2 ] _ given a positive borel measure @xmath1 and a premeasure @xmath2 defined on balls and satisfying the two conditions in , is it possible to reconstruct an approximation up to constants of @xmath1 from @xmath2 ?",
    "what about the case when @xmath1 is a signed measure ?",
    "_    first notice that under the assumptions the best one can obtain is a reconstruction @xmath39 of @xmath1 such that @xmath40 for some constant @xmath41 .",
    "we stress that , in the case @xmath42 in ( i ) , this can be easily obtained via carathodory method ii ( with @xmath43 ) while in the case @xmath44 carathodory construction does not provide in general such a measure @xmath39 . loosely speaking",
    ", a loss of mass can happen in the recovery process , as the example presented in section [ section:2.1 ] shows .    in order to recover @xmath1 , or at least some measure equivalent or comparable to @xmath1 ,",
    "the choice of the centers of the balls in the collection , which are used to cover the support of @xmath1 , is crucial .",
    "indeed they must be placed in some nearly - optimal positions , such that even the concentric balls with smaller radius have a significant overlapping with the support of @xmath1 . this led us to consider a packing - type construction .",
    "the packing construction is mainly used to define the packing @xmath45-dimensional measure and its associated notion of packing dimension .",
    "it is in some sense dual to the construction leading to hausdorff measure and dimension , and was introduced by c. tricot in @xcite .",
    "then tricot and taylor in @xcite extended it to the case of a general premeasure . in our setting",
    "we show that this packing construction can be formulated in a simpler and more manageable way ( see section [ sect : packtype ] ) .    since the lower bound on @xmath46",
    "is given in terms of @xmath47 , in the case @xmath44 and under some additional assumptions on the metric space @xmath0 we prove a suitable version of besicovitch covering lemma ( see proposition [ prop_diffusion_in_x ] and corollary [ bescivoic_with_doubling_balls ] ) , which represents a key ingredient in our construction and seems also of independent interest .",
    "some further explanations about the assumption on @xmath46 are in order .",
    "an example of @xmath46 satisfying is @xmath48 more generally one could consider @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a non - increasing probability density function .",
    "notice that in @xmath51 this last expression corresponds to the convolution of @xmath1 with @xmath52 , while for a general metric space it may be understood as an extension of the convolution operation .",
    "we also remark that the starting motivation of our study is related to the problem of rectifiability of a @xmath53varifold @xmath54 in @xmath51 obtained as the limit of `` discrete varifolds '' ( see @xcite ) .",
