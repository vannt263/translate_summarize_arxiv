    "metastability and hysteresis are exhibited by numerous natural and artificial systems that are driven away from thermodynamic equilibrium by an external  field . \" in the absence of such a field , and below some critical temperature or analogous control parameter , a large class of such systems possess two equivalent , symmetry - broken ordered phases .",
    "the external field selects one of these ordered phases as the global , stable minimum in the multidimensional free - energy landscape .",
    "the other ordered phase becomes metastable , separated from the basin of attraction of the stable phase by a free - energy barrier .",
    "if the system is initially prepared in the metastable phase and thermal fluctuations are present , the system eventually ( possibly after an extremely long time ) escapes from the metastable free - energy well and approaches stable equilibrium . in the present paper",
    "we consider the response of a _ spatially extended _ , bistable system driven by an external field which is periodic in time .",
    "in particular , we focus on the _ finite - size effects _ of the periodic system response .    ferromagnets are perhaps the most commonly known systems that exhibit metastability and hysteresis . in this paper",
    "we therefore use magnetic language , in which the order parameter is the system magnetization @xmath0 , and its conjugate field is the external magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "analogous interpretations , e.g. , using the terms  polarization \" and  electric field \" for ferroelectric systems , `` coverage '' and `` electrochemical potential '' for adsorbate systems , etc . , are straightforward @xcite",
    ".    the dynamic response under an oscillating external field can be viewed as a competition between two time scales : the half - period @xmath2 of the external field ( proportional to the inverse driving frequency ) and the average metastable lifetime @xmath3 of the system ( the mean time spent in the metastable well ) after a sudden field reversal . for low driving frequencies ,",
    "the time - dependent magnetization oscillates about zero in synchrony with the external field ( symmetric dynamic phase ) . for high frequencies , however , the magnetization does not have time to switch sign during one half - period , and it oscillates about one or the other of its degenerate zero - field values ( asymmetric dynamic phase ) . this symmetry breaking and",
    "the corresponding dynamic phase transition ( dpt ) between the symmetric and the asymmetric limit cycles of the system magnetization have attracted considerable attention over the last decade .",
    "it was first observed during numerical integration of the mean - field equation of motion for the magnetization of a ferromagnet in an oscillating field @xcite .",
    "since then it has been the focus of investigation in numerous monte carlo simulations of kinetic ising systems , further mean - field studies @xcite , and most recently in analytic studies of a bistable time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) model @xcite . the dpt may also have been experimentally observed in co on cu(001 ) ultrathin magnetic films @xcite and recently in numerical studies of fully frustrated josephson - junction arrays @xcite and anisotropic heisenberg models @xcite .",
    "the results of these studies agree that there exists a genuine continuous phase transition between the symmetric and asymmetric dynamic phases , at least in some region of the parameter space spanned by temperature , field , and half - period .",
    "finite - size scaling studies of data from dynamic monte carlo simulations @xcite , as well as analytic arguments @xcite have demonstrated that this far - from - equilibrium phase transition belongs to the same universality class as the equilibrium ising model in zero field .",
    "this result is consistent with previous symmetry @xcite and renormalization group @xcite arguments @xcite .    in their original paper on the dpt in a mean - field model @xcite , tom and de  oliveira reported that the continuous ( second - order ) phase transition observed at high temperatures appeared to change at a tricritical point ( tcp ) to a discontinuous ( first - order ) transition for low temperatures .",
    "such a tcp was also reported in later mean - field work @xcite . however",
    ", an analytical and numerical mean - field study by zimmer @xcite makes a strong case that the claims for a tcp in the mean - field case is based on a misinterpretation of effects of critical slowing - down at the dpt .",
    "similar claims , that in some region of the dynamic phase diagram _ spatially extended _ kinetic ising models exhibit a first - order transition and consequently have a tcp separating lines of second - order and first - order dynamic phase transitions , have also been made on the basis of dynamic monte carlo studies @xcite .",
    "for recent reviews on the dpt , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to clear up the remaining confusion about the interpretation of simulation results for the dpt in spatially extended kinetic ising models , in particular in the low - temperature regime where a first - order transition and a tcp have been claimed to exist @xcite . those conclusions were essentially based on data for a single system size , and we here demonstrate how proper consideration of rather subtle finite - size effects leads to a different picture .",
    "the implication of our theoretical arguments and monte carlo simulations presented in this paper is that in an _ infinitely large _",
    "system a continuous dpt should persist down to arbitrarily low temperatures .",
    "however , in any _ finite _ system for sufficiently low frequencies , the dpt gives way to a transient regime of _ stochastic resonance _",
