    "the quest for higgs bosons is of utmost importance at high energy colliders @xcite .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) predicts one neutral higgs boson ( @xmath5 ) for which a lower limit on its mass @xmath6 gev has been obtained by direct searches at lep2 in the production channel @xmath7 @xcite . for the lightest cp  even higgs boson ( @xmath0 ) of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "the analogous mechanism @xmath8 has a mixing angle suppression of @xmath9 relative to the cross ",
    "section for @xmath5 . however , this factor is close to 1 in most of the allowed supersymmetric ( susy ) parameter space , and even if @xmath9 is suppressed , the complementary channel @xmath10 can be used .",
    "combining these two search mechanisms enabled lep to obtain the bound @xmath11 gev in the mssm @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , much weaker numerical bounds apply to the lightest neutral cp  even higgs boson @xmath0 in a general ( non  supersymmetric ) two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite . here",
    "the factor @xmath9 is a free parameter and merely taking @xmath12 reduces the direct search bound to @xmath13 gev @xcite . hence a very light @xmath0 ( @xmath14 gev ) is not excluded by direct searches and is also entirely consistent with electroweak precision fits @xcite . in the mssm case",
    "the above bound @xmath15 gev can be weakened in specific regions of parameter space if explicit cp violating phases are present in some susy parameters . in this scenario",
    "the cp  even and cp  odd scalar fields mix resulting in three mass eigenstates @xmath16 which are now not definite eigenstates of cp @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath17 can be very suppressed , thus debilitating the lep searches in the channel @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , the complementary search channel @xmath19 can be rendered ineffective due to the dominance of the experimentally challenging decay @xmath20 .",
    "if the cp violating phases are large ( @xmath21 ) , and other susy parameters are chosen to enhance the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing ( called the `` cpx scenario '' in @xcite ) , there remains a region @xmath22 gev , @xmath23 and @xmath24 gev which was not covered by lep and will remain elusive in all standard search channels at both the tevatron run ii and lhc @xcite .",
    "a high energy @xmath25 linear collider operating at @xmath26 gev would provide much improved coverage of this region via @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .    in the meantime",
    ", it is of interest to seek alternative production mechanisms for a very light @xmath0 ( of the 2hdm ) and @xmath27 ( of the mssm ) at existing colliders such as the tevatron run ii . which has zero tree ",

    "this mechanism might offer a favourable signal / background ratio , but requires suitable proton tagging detectors to be installed . in this paper",
    "we suggest an additional production process , @xmath31 , which is unsuppressed in the above elusive parameter space .",
    "this mechanism was first proposed in @xcite in the context of light fermiophobic higgs bosons ( @xmath32 ) with enhanced @xmath33 decays , and in this paper we consider its application to the above scenarios of a light @xmath0 and @xmath27 .",
    "we will show that @xmath34 ) can be comparable in size to the diffractive production mechanism , and that the branching ratio ( br ) for @xmath35 can be large in the parameter space of interest , which would lead to the non ",

    "this view is justified in the mssm _ without _ explicit cp violating phases in the susy parameters .",
    "a small @xmath48 is ensured since the coupling @xmath41 @xmath49 is suppressed in the mssm parameter space for @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , the phase space suppression is substantial at tevatron energies due to the current lower bounds of @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 gev .",
    "however , @xmath48 is much larger if the following conditions are fulfilled @xcite :    * there is little or no mixing angle suppression in the coupling @xmath41 * @xmath0 is very light    both these conditions are satisfied in the mssm elusive parameter space of a light @xmath27 with suppressed coupling @xmath53 . in a 2hdm the condition for a light , undetected @xmath0 is merely that the coupling @xmath54 is small .",
    "this corresponds to taking small values of @xmath9 which maximizes the coupling @xmath41 @xmath55 . in both these scenarios the processes @xmath38 and @xmath56",
    "are not so suppressed , and thus this mechanism may offer a chance of probing the problematic parameter space .    in @xcite this mechanism was applied to a special case of the 2hdm with a light fermiophobic higgs , @xmath32 , which has a large br@xmath57 ) and thus a relatively high experimental detection efficiency .",

    "interestingly , we will show that br(@xmath3 ) can be large , which would give rise to the non ",

    "a caveat here is that this bound can be weakened to the current direct search limits ( @xmath74 gev ) if cp violating phases are added in the 2hdm @xcite , or in a model with more than 2 higgs doublets @xcite,@xcite . given these possibilities , in our analysis for the 2hdm we will consider @xmath40 as light as 90 gev . in the mssm it is known that @xmath71 constraints depend strongly on the flavour sector and @xmath75 gev @xmath76 gev ( corresponding to the elusive region ) is permissible parameter space .",
    "we will show results for @xmath68 ) for a light @xmath0 in the 2hdm .",

    "we calculate the coupling @xmath82 in this region by using the public code cph.f @xcite ( which was used in @xcite ) and find @xmath83 , which is consistent with our choice of 0.97 used above .",

    "we note that a further enhancement of @xmath68 ) comes from the the qcd correction factor of 1.3 @xcite which we have not included in fig.1 .",
