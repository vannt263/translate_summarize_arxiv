    "the bh approximation assumes that the interaction energy between two particles in the same optical well is negligible with respect to the energy difference between the two lowest bloch states of the full periodic hamiltonian .",
    "it also considers that the ground state of the system can be described by a superposition of functions localized entirely within each of those wells .",
    "obviously , this implies that not all systems of neutral atoms on optical lattices could be described accurately by a bose hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , that description is expected to break down for shallow potential depths ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) , in which both approximations fail @xcite . on top of that , in the bh model the real interparticle interactions of the full hamiltonian are further approximated by short - range pseudopotentials that depend only on the scattering length and the mass of the atom .    in this work , we will solve the full schrdinger equation derived from the continuous hamiltonian of eq .",

    "our goal will be to study the onset of the superfluid - mott insulator transition in different asymmetric lattices .",
    "when the number of particles is not the same at each lattice minimum , the particles can jump to less populated wells , creating a superfluid phase .",
    "we have also a superfluid when the number of neutral atoms is an integer multiple of the number of the lattice minima , but the depth of the optical lattice potential is low enough to permit tunneling between lattice sites .",
    "however , there is a critical value of those depths for which tunneling becomes impossible .",
    "the phase in which the atoms are pinned to their respective positions is termed a mott insulator ( m.i . ) . in this work we will be dealing with mott insulators",
    "for which the number of particles at each minimum is equal to one ( @xmath30 = 1 ) , even though phases with two or more particles per well are possible .",
    "the appearance of the mott insulator can be monitored then in two ways .",
    "first , for @xmath30 = 1 , one can track the disappearance of the superfluid when the optical lattice potential increases .",
    "this is the way chosen in ref . for 3d systems .",
    "second , we can check if the chemical potential of the system has a gap around @xmath30 = 1 .",
    "this is the approach used in simulations with the bh model @xcite and in refs . .",
    "ref . tested that the superfluid and chemical potential criteria were equivalent for quasi one - dimensional systems of hard spheres .",
    "the asymmetrical lattices were constructed by making @xmath31 , @xmath32 being a parameter that we varied in the range 0.01 - 100 . in that way , we can model the results of some experiments in which the magnitude of the potential well in one direction is different than in the other two ( see for instance refs . ) . in the case",
    "@xmath32= 1 , we have a standard three dimensional symmetric lattice",
    ". however , when @xmath33 0 , the atoms are trapped within quasi - two dimensional layers parallel to the @xmath34 plane with no possibility of hopping in the @xmath35 direction unless @xmath6 is small enough . in the opposite limit , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are both very large with respect to @xmath6 , allowing the movement of the confined species only in the @xmath35 direction . for each @xmath32 , there is a minimum value of the @xmath6 parameter ( for @xmath39 ) or @xmath37 , ( for @xmath40 ) from which we start to observe a discontinuity in the chemical potential when there is exactly one atom at each potential well .",
    "that critical value marks the onset of the superfluid - mott insulator transition . for each simulation",
    ", we fixed the value of @xmath6 and changed @xmath32 to produce different values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "however , we checked that proceeding the other way around , i.e. , keeping constant @xmath37 and @xmath38 and making @xmath41 , gave us the same values of the critical parameters .",
    "to solve the schdinger equation we used a standard diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) technique @xcite .",
    "this stochastic method provides an exact solution for the ground state of any system of bosons , within the uncertainties derived from the introduction of an initial approximation to that ground state , the so - called _ trial _ function . the one chosen in this work was : @xmath42 where the @xmath43 s stand for the positions of the @xmath18 neutral atoms loaded in the optical lattice , and the @xmath17 s correspond to the distance between the pair of particles labeled @xmath15 and @xmath16 . here",

    "the primary output of a dmc calculation is the energy of the ground state .",
    "as we are working at @xmath53 , that means that the chemical potential can be obtained straightforwardly from dmc results as the the derivative of the total energy of the system with respect to the number of particles .",
    "in order to evaluate the stability of the results obtained when we vary the size of the simulation cell used in our monte carlo calculations , we have computed the energy per particle of a system of @xmath18 bosons in a symmetric three dimensional simulation cell with @xmath18 optical lattice wells , with different values of @xmath18 and different geometries of the simulation cell .",

    "[ fig : e_vs_n ] is that the finite size effects that could affect the energy are greatly reduced when one goes from an homogeneous gas to a gas loaded in an optical lattice .",

    "moreover , we verified that for @xmath32 = 1 , the critical value of @xmath6 obtained from calculations with @xmath55 , @xmath65 and @xmath56 simulation cells was the same .",

    "we can see also a smooth decay in the critical parameter from @xmath32 = 1 to the smallest @xmath32 considered ( @xmath100 0.01 ) , a behavior similar to the already discussed for the quasi - one dimensional part of the diagram .",
