    "a signed graph is an ordinary graph whose each edge is endowed with either a positive sign or a negative sign .",
    "the system was formally introduced by harary  @xcite who characterized balanced signed graphs up to switching , and was much developed by zaslavsky  @xcite who successfully extended most important notions of ordinary graphs to signed graphs , such as circuit , bond , orientation , incidence matrix , laplacian , and associated matroids , etc .",
    "based on zaslavsky s work , chen and wang  @xcite introduced flow and tension lattices of signed graphs and obtained fundamental properties on flows and tensions , including a few characterizations of cuts and bonds .",
    "now it is natural to ask , inside the flow and tension lattices , how integral flows and tensions are build up from more basic integral flows and tensions . more specifically ,",
    "what does an integral flow or tension look like if it _ can not _ be decomposed at integer scale but can be possibly decomposed further at fractional scale ?",
    "the answer is not only interesting but fundamental in nature because if one considers circuit flows to be at atomic level then indecomposable flows are at molecular level .    for ordinary graphs",
    "it is easy to see that indecomposable flows are simply the graph circuit flows at integer scale . for signed graphs , however , we shall see that indecomposable flows are much richer than that of unsigned graphs because in addition to circuit flows , the fixed spin ( signs on edges ) produces a new class of characteristic vectors of so - called _ directed eulerian cycle - trees _ , which are not decomposable at integer scale while decomposable ( into signed graph circuit flows ) at half - integer scale .",
