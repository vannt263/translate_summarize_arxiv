    "in the core accretion model , jupiter s atmosphere is largely derived from solar nebula gas that was gravitationally captured by a @xmath110 earth mass solid core , with additional contribution from planetesimals that were accreted during the planets formation @xcite . as the nebular gas would have had roughly a solar composition , any deviations in the composition of the planet s atmosphere from that of the sun is thought to reflect the contribution of the late accreted planetesimals .",
    "the _ galileo _ probe , during its decent , found that the the ratios ar / h , kr / h , xe / h , c / h , n / h , and s / h were 2 - 4 times greater than a gas of solar composition gas @xcite .",
    "the high abundances of these volatile elements , particularly the noble gases , is puzzling as they do not react with solids and do not freeze out as pure species , and thus are not expected in planetesimals until very low temperatures ( @xmath210 k ) are reached .",
    "two mechanisms that attribute the enhanced abundances of these elements to accretion of cold , icy planetesimals have been proposed .",
    "the first was that these elements were trapped in amorphous water ice at very low temperatures ( @xmath330 k ) @xcite .",
    "at these low temperatures , experiments have shown that gaseous molecules and atoms that are adsorbed on a solid surface become trapped as water freezes out on that solid @xcite .",
    "as very low temperatures are required to produce amorphous ice and to allow for efficient trapping , this mechanism requires that jupiter formed from or accreted planetesimals from much further away from the sun than its current location , or that temperatures in the jupiter - formation zone were much lower than predicted by current models for the solar nebula .",
    "the second mechanism involves forming clathrate hydrates , crystalline ice with guest molecules trapped inside @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the abundances of volatiles that would be trapped as clathrates formed in a cooling solar nebula and found that the predicted abundances of noble gases , c , and n would match the abundances inferred from the _ galileo _ probe measurements .",
    "however , they found that s would be present at a greater abundance than was observed .",
    "to explain the discrepancy in the predicted and observed s abundances , @xcite suggested that h@xmath0s , the primary gaseous carrier of s in the planet formation region was depleted due to the formation of troilite via the reaction : @xmath4 .",
    "troilite is commonly found in meteoritic materials , and the reaction occurs on timescales that are short compared to the lifetime of the solar nebula @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that only @xmath135% of h@xmath0s would need to be removed via this reaction to match the _ galileo _ probe measurements , and suggested that as fes formed in the terrestrial planet region of the solar nebula , h@xmath0s depleted gas diffused out to the jupiter formation region , allowing for lower amounts of s to be locked up in clathrates than would otherwise occur .",
    "while some use such a depletion for a starting point in giant planet formation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite challenged this idea , calling the removal of this much h@xmath0s `` quantitatively unsupportable . ''",
    "@xcite offered an alternative explanation for the volatile abundance . citing the low oxygen abundance measured by the probe , @xcite suggested jupiter formed inside the snow line .",
    "all volatiles were then accreted directly from the solar nebula gas , with additional c and n delivered in the form of organics . in this model sulfur could trace the contribution of solids and gas accreted by the planet : if s was distributed purely in the gas , then its relative abundance should be the same as all other gaseous species ; if s was present as a solid ( fes ) then its abundance would reflect the amount of solids accreted by jupiter as it formed .",
    "@xcite noted that the s - to - noble gas ratio was solar , and assumed that it was delivered as fes , and thus concluded that jupiter formed from a solar mix of solids and nebular gas .",
    "the behavior and speciation of s in the solar nebula and its distribution between the gas and solids is thus critical to understanding how volatiles were delivered to a young jupiter .",
    "@xcite explored this issue by modeling the evolving concentration of h@xmath0s within a turbulent , diffusive protoplanetary disk .",
    "h@xmath0s was assumed to be removed from the gas due to fes formation where temperatures fell in the range of 500 - 690 k. the upper bound of 690 k was chosen as this was where fes became stable in the nebula , while the lower bound of 500 k was set because reaction kinetics were too slow to produce much fes .",
    "any h@xmath0s that diffused into the region of the nebula that fell in this temperature range was assumed to immediately react with fe and the sulfur permanently locked up there as fes . as a result ,",
    "the h@xmath0s abundance decreased throughout the nebula over time , reaching @xmath365% of its initial value inside @xmath16 au in 10@xmath5 years , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "while providing important insights into the h@xmath0s evolution in the solar nebula , the treatment of fes formation was somewhat simplified in @xcite .",
    "for example , chemical kinetics were calculated assuming the pressure and temperature conditions at the disk midplane and a solar abundance of h@xmath0s . due to diffusion ,",
    "grains would have been mixed throughout the vertical extent of the disk , where temperatures and pressures were much lower , and reaction timescales longer @xcite .",
    "further , the lower abundances of h@xmath0s as the disk evolved implies longer reaction times as the rate of fes formation is directly proportional to the partial pressure of h@xmath0s . finally , particles would have migrated in and out of the fes formation region on timescales less than or comparable to the chemical timescales , suggesting that complete reaction between h@xmath0s and fe would not necessarily occur .    here",
    "a new model that tracks the motions of dust grains in a dynamically evolving protoplanetary disk is used to expand the study of @xcite and quantify in detail the extent to which fe and s would react prior to jupiter s formation , with the focus on the level to which h@xmath0s becomes depleted as a result of troilite formation and the implications for the s abundance where clathrates could form .",
    "the modeling methods are described in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "the results for two examples of protoplanetary disk evolutionary histories are presented .",
    "these results and the implications for the determining factors for planetary compositions in our solar system are discussed at the conclusion of the paper .",
    "particle tracking methods @xcite are employed to determine the exact physical environments the fe / fes grains were exposed to within the evolving solar nebula .",
    "the evolution of the protoplanetary disk is modeled using the classical @xmath6-viscosity formalism , where stresses within the differentially rotating gas drive mass and angular momentum transport @xcite , which allows us to consider the evolution of the disk over @xmath110@xmath7 years of evolution .",
    "the viscosity in the disk is given by @xmath8=@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the local speed of sound , @xmath11 is the local disk scale - height , and @xmath6 is a parameter describing the strength of the viscosity .",
    "the motions of the grains in the disk were calculated accounting for vertical settling by gravity , gas drag migration , advective flows associated with disk evolution , and diffusion , where the diffusivity was taken to equal to the disk viscosity ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "a similar model was used by @xcite , though only diffusive redistribution of the gas was considered ; the disk structure was not allowed to evolve during the time of interest .",
    "iron particles of a given radius , @xmath13 , were suspended across the disk at constant fe / h@xmath0 mass ratio of @xmath14=1.67@xmath1510@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the mass of the particles was set at @xmath17=@xmath18 where @xmath19=7.874 g/@xmath20 . as tracking the dynamics of each iron grain in the solar nebula",
    "is computationally prohibitive ( a @xmath21=0.1@xmath22 disk would contain @xmath11.67@xmath1510@xmath23 @xmath22 of fe , which would amount to @xmath110@xmath24 fe grains 1 @xmath25 m grains ) , each model grain is treated as a _ super - grain _ with its evolution representing the evolution of a number of other grains equal to @xmath26/@xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of super - grains considered in the simulation .",
    "the super - grains were distributed radially within the disk to ensure a solar - ratio of fe / h@xmath0 throughout .",
    "grains were initially placed at the disk midplane , however vertical mixing leads to grains becoming well mixed vertically on short timescales @xcite , making the choice of initial @xmath29 unimportant for our results .",
    "iron grains sulfidize through reaction with h@xmath0s to produce troilite , while troilite decomposes following the reverse reaction : @xmath30 . because of the low pressures expected in protoplanetary disks , one of the primary controls on the rate of gas - grain reactions is the collision rate of reacting gas molecules with the grains @xcite .",
    "the collision rate of a gaseous species , @xmath31 , with a grain is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the pressure of the species in bars , @xmath34 is the molecular weight of the gaseous molecule , @xmath35 is the temperature of the gas and solid , and @xmath13 is the radius of the grain .",
    "the fraction of such collisions that would result in the reaction proceeding would be determined by the activation energy of the reaction , @xmath36 , and given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the gas constant .",
    "experiments found that the activation energy for troilite formation ( the forward reaction here ) falls in the range of 42 - 50 kj / mol @xcite .",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath39=50 kj / mol , but have found lower values in this range do not change the results significantly .",
    "the reverse reaction , where the s in fes combines with h@xmath0 to form h@xmath0s gas leaving fe behind , can be determined using the equilibrium constant for the reaction as in @xcite , giving @xmath40=115 kj / mol .",
    "the rate at which iron is converted into fes is given by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of fe atoms in a grain and @xmath43 is the fraction of iron in the grain remaining in metallic form , while @xmath44 represented the fraction of iron taken up as fes .",
    "only small , micron - sized grains are considered so that the diffusion of s in the grain is not a rate - limiting step , and thus can be ignored @xcite .",
    "two illustrative cases are considered , each with a 0.1 m@xmath45 disk with an initial surface density profile given by @xmath46=@xmath47 extending from @xmath48=0.05 au to @xmath49 , with @xmath49=10 and 50 au at the beginning of the simulations . in each case @xmath6=10@xmath16 .",
    "grain movement is calculated using the particle tracking methods in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in carrying out the calculations",
    ", the disk evolves for a time step , @xmath50=@xmath51 yr , after which time the surface density and temperature are updated everywhere . the movement of the grains",
    "are then determined using the local disk properties .",
    "the chemical evolution of these grains is calculated using the conditions at the new location . in calculating the chemical evolution of each grain",
    ", it is assumed that the solids remain in contact with the same gas throughout the course of a calculation .",
    "that is , as troilite forms in a grain , that grain continues to react with the h@xmath0s - depleted gas .",
    "grains that migrate within @xmath48=0.5 au of the sun are assumed to be lost from the disk , carrying whatever s they contain with them . in all cases ,",
    "@xmath28=2x10@xmath5 super - particles are considered in the model , with each grain representing @xmath15@xmath1510@xmath52 actual iron grains .",
    "the vertical structure of the disk is calculated assuming a purely viscous model as the focus is on the early evolution of the disk when mass and angular momentum transport are rapid and thus internal heating would dominate .",
    "high temperatures are expected during this early epoch @xcite . at later times , mass transport",
    "may be limited to the surface layers of the disk and irradiative heating would control the thermal structure leading to temperatures throughout the disk would be so low to prevent significant reaction between h@xmath0s and fe or decomposition of fes .",
    "this meaning that iron sulfidization was limited to the very early stages of solar nebula evolution .",
    "note that the changes in h@xmath0 abundance due to chemical reactions are minimal and do not impact the overall surface density of the disk anywhere .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of the two cases described above , with the h@xmath0s distribution in the gas , normalized to its solar value , shown throughout the inner 10 au of the disk at times of 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 and 1 myr .",
    "the distribution is found counting the particles at each time in a series of radial bins and calculating the amount of h@xmath0s remaining in for each particle , then dividing by the area to get the surface density of the gas .",
    "this is then normalized to the abundance of h@xmath0s that would be expected for a solar s / h ratio , given the local surface density .",
    "valleys in the h@xmath0s distribution are readily apparent , centered in the 0.5 - 1.5 au range in each case .",
    "these valleys correspond to where fes was readily produced through reaction of fe with h@xmath0s , as midplane temperatures ranged here from @xmath1400 - 700 k. viscous disks begin in a very hot state due to the high rates of dissipation ( heat production ) and high optical depths ( heat retention ) , but cool with time as they lose mass to their central stars and expand due to angular momentum conservation , thinning the disk and allowing radiation to escape more readily .",
    "thus the region of fes production migrates closer to the star with time .",
    "inside of these valleys temperatures were higher leading to decomposition of fes and the return of h@xmath0s to the gas , while in the outer disk temperatures were too low for much fes to form and any fes found there , or h@xmath0s removed , is a result of reactions in the inner disk and outward transport through the disk .",
    "the gradual decrease in h@xmath0s near the inner edge of the disk is an artifact of the calculations and arises due to the removal of particles from the simulation inside of 0.5 au to represent loss by accretion onto the star .    while similarities exist between the results presented here and those of @xcite , in that h@xmath0s abundances can decrease in the disk over time , key differences are apparent .",
    "most important among these is that the concentration of h@xmath0s does not decrease indefinitely here as it did in @xcite . instead ,",
    "the amount of h@xmath0s outside the fes - formation valley remain relatively constant for the @xmath49=50 au case .",
    "while outward diffusion carries h@xmath0s depleted outward in the disk , the net motions of material due to viscous evolution in the disk are inward in this region .",
    "thus the h@xmath0s - depleted gas can only diffuse outward so far before being pushed inwards by the advective motions associated with disk evolution .",
    "however , the initially more compact disk ( @xmath49=10 au ) experiences very rapid outward expansion in this region of the disk , meaning that h@xmath0s - depleted gas not only diffuses outwards , but is also carried outward by the net motions of the disk .",
    "this leads to a significant overall depletion of 2 - 10 au region shown here .",
    "efficient depletion occurs only very early in the history of the disk however , as once the disk expands the net motions of the 2 - 10 au region become directed inward .",
    "this allows materials which originated at greater distances , and thus did not become depleted in h@xmath0s , to be carried inwards . as a result ,",
    "the h@xmath0s abundance increases with time .",
    "depletion of gaseous h@xmath0s in the solar nebula as a result of troilite formation was possible in the solar nebula .",
    "the greatest depletion would have occurred in the inner nebula , where physical conditions allowed the reaction to occur on short timescales .",
    "depletion levels of 65% or greater in the outer solar nebula as needed in the clathration model of @xcite , require that the disk begin in a massive , compact configuration .",
    "this compact structure would have allowed fes to form in the inner disk with h@xmath0s - depleted gas being carried outward during the radial expansion of the disk that occurred during its early viscous evolution .",
    "such a depletion is more difficult to achieve in disks which begin with a more extended structure , as the net flow for the inner disk is directed towards the star .",
    "an initially compact disk would result in significant outward radial transport of materials beyond just fe and fes grains or h@xmath0s gas . @xcite and @xcite argued that a similar configuration would aid in the outward transport and preservation of calcium , aluminum - rich inclusions ( cais ) found in meteorites .",
    "indeed , this dynamical evolution could lead to significant mixing of inner solar nebula materials into the outer solar nebula as postulated by @xcite and be consistent with the high abundance of refractory materials found in the stardust samples from comet wild 2 @xcite .",
    "thus this evolution may be consistent with other evidence for radial mixing and transport in the disk .    in the calculations presented here ,",
    "h@xmath0s was depleted only through reaction with fe to produce fes , however other reactions may occur , incorporating s into solids . for example , h@xmath0s may react with nh@xmath53 gas at lower temperatures to form nh@xmath54sh solids .",
    "the importance of this reaction depends on the extent to which n is present as nh@xmath53 : equilibrium chemical models predict that nh@xmath53 should be the dominant form , but sluggish kinetics may keep much of n in the form of n@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the exact level of conversion will depend on the p - t conditions that gas was exposed to during solar nebula evolution .",
    "this issue will be the focus of future work , using the methods outlined here .    while h@xmath0s can be depleted in the outer solar nebula ,",
    "this region is not predicted to be depleted in total s. fes grains would be carried outward by the same dynamical evolution which carried h@xmath0s - depleted gas to this region .",
    "@xcite criticized the model of @xcite on the grounds that removal of the needed sulfur in the gas phase would lead to too much fes in the inner solar nebula , which can not be reconciled with the observed compositions of the terrestrial planets . here",
    ", we find that fes would not remain in the inner solar nebula , but would be mixed and made available to outer solar system bodies . as a result",
    ", the s content of planetesimals would be higher than predicted by clathrate models alone : while a lower abundance of h@xmath0s allows the proper s / h ratio to be achieved in the ices described by @xcite , additional s would be found in the rocky component of the dust that these planetesimals formed from .",
    "this suggests that h@xmath0s must have been depleted to an even greater degree if clathrate - bearing plantesimals are to properly account for the compositions of jupiter s atmosphere .",
    "it is unlikely all s is locked up in rocky materials , as @xcite found that h@xmath0s emissions from comet hale - bopp were consistent with the molecule being present in comet itself , and not the product of photochemistry in the coma .",
    "additional measurements of s abundances and its speciation in comets will provide important insights into how this element was distributed and the extent to which it may have been locked up as a rocky mineral during the early , hot phase of solar nebula evolution .",
