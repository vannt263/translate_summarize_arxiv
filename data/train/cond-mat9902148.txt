    "[ fig_flux ] .",
    "thus the existence of a common tangent @xmath203 hinges on the weakness of the temperature dependent factor @xmath208 which in turn depends somewhat on the details of the system .",
    "however , since the temperature dependence of @xmath183 is dramatic just above the kt transition , the common tangent should to good approximation exist at least in a limited region above the kt transition .",
    "below the kt transition there are no free vortices and the response is given by the vortex pairs eqs .",

    "[ fig_all](b ) an indication that the curves develop a plateau as the kt transition is approached from above ( compare the curve for @xmath212 ) .",

    "[ fig_all](a ) for @xmath182|$ ] and has also been found for the @xmath160 model with the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) dynamics .",
    "in the present paper we have explored the fact that the typical experimental setup for measuring the magnetic flux noise for a superconductor , or jja , corresponds to the case when the distance @xmath0 to the pick - up coil is much larger than the relevant microscopic lengths . in this limit",

    "@xcite in this paper we have studied this connection in some more detail .    we have also demonstrated that both the shape and the characteristic frequency of the spectrum depend on the distance @xmath0 to the pick - up coil .",
    "this means that no detailed conclusions can be drawn from simulations which presumes @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , there is a qualitative difference between the _ vorticity_-noise spectrum , which corresponds to discrete events over a sharp boundary , and the _ magnetic - flux_-noise spectrum which corresponds to spread - out objects over a boundary . the experimental situation corresponds to a _",

    "@xcite nevertheless the _ vorticity_-noise spectrum for @xmath61 has a @xmath168 tail for higher frequencies which seems to match the experimental results ,  @xcite whereas the _ magnetic - flux_-noise spectra for @xmath61 does not have such a tail . in accordance with the present simulations , we suggest that the resolution of this dichotomy is that in the large-@xmath0 limit the magnetic - flux - noise spectrum does have an _ intermediate _ region with a @xmath213 behavior and that it is this intermediate region which is seen in the experiments .",
    "the proportionality between the magnetic - flux - noise spectrum and the real part of the conductivity implies that the noise spectra for a sequence of temperatures just above the kt transition should in a log - log plot have a common tangent with the slope @xmath191 .",
    "the existence of such a common tangent has also be verified in experiments ,  @xcite as well as in the present simulations .",
    "we also explicitly demonstrated through our simulations that for small @xmath0 there is no such common tangent .",
    "the existence of a common tangent is by itself not necessarily conclusive .",
    "for example , the experimental data for the jja s in ref .",
    "correspond to the large-@xmath0 case and the data have indeed a common tangent with slope @xmath191 .",
    "however , the spectra at a fixed temperature seem to have a @xmath203 behavior over a very large region , which differ markedly from the spectra obtained in our simulations for the rsj model .",
    "the present simulations also suggest that immediately above the kt transition there should be a very small temperature region where the noise spectrum has an intermediate interval with a @xmath203 behavior .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that the data in ref .   might perhaps be related to this temperature region closest to the transition .",
    "@xcite however , at the moment there seem to be no accepted explanation for the @xmath203-behavior found in ref .  .",
    "@xcite    finally , we showed that the amplitude of the flux - noise spectrum drops dramatically as the temperature is decreased below the kt transition , and that at the same time the characteristic frequency increases .",
