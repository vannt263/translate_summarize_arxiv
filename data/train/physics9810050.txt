    "the most crucial step in a solution  phase chemical reaction is almost always a thermal activation ; improbable as it may be , the solvent must find some avenue for concentrating enough of its kinetic energy within the vibrations of the reactants to allow the reaction to proceed .",
    "@xcite a similar challenge can be posed later on in the process ; the ability of the resulting products to return any excess vibrational energy back to the solvent is often critical to the outcome of the reaction .",
    "@xcite beyond these issues however , there is a conceptual importance to understanding such vibrational energy transfers that goes to the heart of how one thinks about the dynamical role of a solvent . if the entire solvent - solute system is regarded as a `` super molecule '' ( as might be appropriate for solid - state vibrational relaxation ) , then the question is how a v  v relaxation occurs  that is , which vibrations of the system as a whole ( which phonons ) can serve as repositories for the solute s vibrational energy .",
    "@xcite if , on the other hand , we consider the solute to be buffeted by occasional collisions with individual solvent molecules , a very natural perspective for the gas phase , what we need to understand is a v  t process .",
    "@xcite so how is it that we should think about vibrational energy relaxation in liquids ?",
    "@xcite    a formal answer to this question arises quite simply from a fermi s golden rule evaluation of the relaxation rate .",
    "@xcite within the apparently quite broad reach of low  order time ",
    "dependent perturbation theory , the rate at which vibrational energy relaxes from a given solute mode , @xmath2 , is proportional to the fourier component of the autocorrelation function of the force on that mode at the mode s own frequency , @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite for a diatomic molecule of reduced mass @xmath4 , for example , the classical vibrational energy relaxation rate is predicted to obey the landau ",
    "teller formula ,  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 here @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath8 is the temperature , and by @xmath9 , the fluctuating force on the mode , we mean the hypothetical classical time evolution of the solvent that would occur were the mode itself held motionless .    leaving aside such issues as whether a purely classical treatment of the solvent can adequately represent the influence on what is frequently a rather quantum mechanical vibration ,  @xcite it seems clear that this approach can usually be counted on to give a numerically accurate rendition of classical vibrational energy relaxation .",
    "@xcite more than that , though , it provides a conceptually suggestive rendition because it fits so nicely into the broader context of relaxation in liquids . within a generalized langevin representation of the problem",
    ", the function @xmath10 can be interpreted as an approximation to the solvent - induced friction felt by a vibrating coordinate  and since the exact friction can sometimes be determined by simulation , it has been possible both to check and to understand the formalism s accuracy .",
    "@xcite    still , the fact that numerical success does not necessarily translate into conceptual insight becomes clear once we try to get at the central v  v vs. v  t dichotomy .",
    "it has long been appreciated that any frequency ",
    "domain friction @xmath11 can be regarded as having its origin in the dynamics of a dense set of harmonic oscillators , oscillators whose frequencies span the frequency range of the friction and which are coupled linearly to the coordinate of interest .",
    "@xcite the fact that liquid frictions interpreted in this fashion typically have a spectrum spanning a few hundred @xmath0 could thus be taken as evidence that there is indeed something resembling a phonon band of this width in liquids .",
    "it is then but a short step to suggest that any vibrational relaxation of modes with frequencies lying within this band ought to be considered as occuring via a resonant v  v transfer .",
    "this argument is actually rather weak as it stands .",
    "these harmonic oscillators could , in fact , be little more than mathematical constructs lacking any microscopic , molecular foundation .",
    "what gives the argument a bit more substance is that recent work has shown that it is possible to associate these oscillators with the instantaneous normal modes of the solutions , oscillators which really are specific , well  defined molecular motions .",
    "@xcite indeed , perhaps it is fair to say that the basic success of such instantaneous  normal  mode ( inm ) approaches in predicting most of the essential behavior of the vibrational friction lends a certain amount of credibility to what would otherwise be fanciful attempts to take liquid phonon pictures literally in theories of vibrational relaxation .",
    "@xcite    there is , however , a major problem and it is this problem that forms the topic of this paper .",
    "once the vibration to be relaxed lies outside the putative band of the liquid , any theory with nothing but linear forces and harmonic oscillators will predict that energy relaxation is completely forbidden .",
    "@xcite yet , what we might call the high frequency modes of solutes ( those with frequencies higher than the debye frequency in the solid  state parlance ) really do relax , albeit very slowly .",
    "@xcite it is worth noting that the landau ",
    "teller formula itself has no difficulty with this phenomenon ; it simply ascribes the relaxation to the presence of small but finite high  frequency fourier components of the force autocorrelation function .",
    "@xcite the conceptual difficulty is that we have independent evidence about the intrinsic bandwidth of intermolecular vibrations in a liquid , both from theoretical predictions , such as instantaneous ",
    "normal  mode analysis  @xcite and fourier representations of simulated velocity autocorrelation functions  @xcite and from experimental results , such as those from far infrared , rayleigh and optical kerr effect spectra .",
    "@xcite none of these estimates give any evidence that the band for simple liquids extends significantly beyond a few hundred @xmath0 . a much more likely scenario than one that would require every simple liquid to have the kinds of 5002000 @xmath0 intermolecular vibrations necessary for simple v ",
    "v processes is that high frequency vibrational energy relaxation is a strongly anharmonic event  and it is this anharmonicity we need to understand .    having made this point , though , there is an interesting distinction we can make .",
    "the relaxation of impurity molecules in crystals can often be modeled as a multiphonon process , one in which the essential harmonicity of the vibrations ( and hence the very idea of phonons ) is respected , but in which the nonlinearity of the coupling forces allows for v - v transfer to overtones of the crystal s intrinsic frequencies .",
    "@xcite in systems as inherently anharmonic as liquids",
    ", however , we could easily imagine that the basic idea of independent harmonic excitations could be the first casualty .",
    "@xcite thus , without further work , it is far from clear which of these two kinds of anharmonicity  the nonlinearity of the forces being driven by the liquid s dynamics or that of the actual dynamics itself  ought to be more critical to high  frequency relaxation in liquids .",
    "in particular , we are still left with the question of whether the v  v paradigm for resonant energy transfer is going to be any better than a v ",
    "t based perspective would be .    complicating this issue",
    "is the fact that there is some evidence on the side of molecular translation being the primary sink for vibrational energy . that is , there is some support for a collisional model for vibrational relaxation .",
    "while it is admittedly far from intuitive how discrete , uncorrelated collisions could ever occur in a dense a medium as a liquid , the so  called isolated  binary collision ( ibc )",
    "model  @xcite has been remarkably successful in rationalizing the thermodynamic state dependence of vibrational population relaxation rates based on just such a picture .",
    "@xcite the notion behind this model is that these rates should factor into a purely few ",
    "body scattering piece specifying the rate of energy transfer per collision , and a liquid  state piece quantifying the rate at which the solvent collides with the solute .",
    "the fact that the concept ( and thus the rate ) of collisions is ill  defined in liquids is certainly vexing ,  @xcite but it is hardly out of the question that some other , more sophisticated analysis of the collision concept might find that the v ",
    "t motif is still a dominant mechanism for relaxation .",
    "the approach we shall take in this paper to getting at these issues is to begin with the standard perturbative ( landau  teller ) expression in terms of the force autocorrelation function , eqs .",
    "( [ l - t - form])([define - fcorr ] ) , but then ask from precisely where we should expect the major high frequency components of the correlation function to arise . for any instantaneous configuration of the liquid , this analysis will immediately lead us to look at the short  time scattering dynamics of the solute and a single crucial solvent partner .",
    "previous work on vibrational relaxation has shown that whenever there is a solvent molecule that is nearer to the solute than any other solvent molecule is to either member of the solute ",
    "solvent pair  that is , whenever there is a mutual  nearest  neighbor solute ",
    "solvent pair  then the high - frequency solvent effects are dominated by the pair , at least within the liquid s band .",
    "@xcite we will show how this observation can be exploited more generally , transcending the limitations to dynamics within the band . not surprisingly , our theoretical prediction for the relaxation rate will then separate into a straightforward few  body dynamical calculation and a residual many ",
    "body problem , just as with ibc theory .",
    "however , unlike the ibc approach , the liquid  state portion of our theory will turn out to rest on a simple , well  defined , purely equilibrium question .",
    "moreover , our development will make it clear how we can make connections between this v ",
    "t theory and the harmonic instantaneous dynamics of instantaneous  normal ",
    "modes , and thereby connect with the v  v energy transfer ideas which seem to work so well within the solvent band .    the remainder of the paper will be organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] will present our basic theory , an expression for the full force autocorrelation function of the system in terms of a correlation function for single degree of freedom , one whose equations of motion we proceed to derive .",
    "section iii then explores the connection to the instantaneous  normal  mode perspective , showing how we can view the new theory as a natural generalization of inm ideas .",
    "section iv provides some numerical examples of how and how well the various approaches work , and we conclude in sec .",
    "v with some general comments on what we are now in a position to say about the questions posed in this introduction .",
    "while the central quantity of interest in vibrational relaxation is the force autocorrelation function of eq .",
    "( [ define - fcorr ] ) , it is convenient to look instead at a mathematically equivalent function , the `` force  velocity '' autocorrelation function ,  @xcite @xmath12 which lets us write the frequency - domain vibrational friction we need in terms of the cosine transform of the new function  @xcite @xmath13 the main reason we bother with this conversion is that this alternative version will suggest a natural division within our problem .",
    "as one might have expected , there will always be contributions from the relative solute ",
    "solvent velocities  the intrinsic dynamics of the problem  but there will be also be separate features dependent directly on the solute  solvent distances  and it is these that will be most pertinent to the solute  solvent coupling .",
    "@xcite indeed , one of the key aspects of our subsequent development will be the realization that these two kinds of information actually play substantially different roles in determining the high  frequency behavior .",
    "we can begin to see how this division occurs by looking at the problem of evaluating a general correlation function of the form of eq .",
    "( [ g - def ] ) when @xmath14 is any specifically solute - centered quantity .",
    "that is , suppose we look at a correlation function of the form of eq .",

    "@xcite    if we substitute eq .",
    "( [ f - dot - def ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ g - def ] ) , we find that the velocity form of the correlation function consists of two kinds of terms , @xmath20\\ w^\\prime[r_{0j}(0)]\\ { \\dot r}_{0j}(t)\\ { \\dot r}_{0j}(0 ) \\right > \\cr\\cr & + & \\left < \\sum_{j , k\\ ( j \\neq k ) } w^\\prime[r_{0j}(t)]\\ w^\\prime[r_{0k}(0)]\\ { \\dot r}_{0j}(t)\\ { \\dot r}_{0k}(0)\\right>\\ , \\label{g - f - explicit } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a binary piece , the first term , which considers only the dynamics caused by the motion of a single solvent at a time , and a ternary piece , the second term , which involves the simultaneous motion of two different solvents .",
    "these two parts will not contribute equally , for reasons we shall come to presently , but the essential ingredients of the correlation function are already visible .",
    "when we evaluate any of the terms at time @xmath21 , @xmath22\\ w^\\prime[r_{0k}(0)]\\ { \\dot r}_{0j}(0)\\ { \\dot r}_{0k}(0 ) \\right > & = & \\left < w^\\prime[r_{0j}(0)]\\ w^\\prime[r_{0k}(0)]\\right>\\ \\left < { \\dot r}_{0j}(0)\\ { \\dot r}_{0k}(0 ) \\right > \\cr\\cr & = & \\delta_{jk } \\left < w^\\prime[r_{0j}(0)]\\ w^\\prime[r_{0j}(0)]\\right>\\ \\left < { \\dot r}_{0j}(0)\\ { \\dot r}_{0j}(0 ) \\right>\\ , \\label{g - at - time0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we notice that the contribution factors rigorously into a static part involving the coupling , @xmath23 , and a dynamical part involving the velocity , @xmath24",
    ". this separation suggests , though , that this same conceptual distinction between coupling and dynamics ought to continue to operate at short times  and therefore at high frequencies  despite the fact that the expression no longer factors .",
    "but , once we make such a distinction , we can simplify our expressions dramatically .",
    "for one thing , at the highest frequencies we should expect coupling to be far more influential than dynamics in determining the correlation function . with typical intermolecular potentials and forces , the sharply varying repulsive parts allow for tremendous variation in the coupling ( and therefore enormous values of @xmath25 just from small changes in internuclear distances .",
    "the velocities , by contrast , never become all that large in magnitude , guided as they are by the equilibrium boltzmann distribution .",
    "we can make this same point a bit more quantitatively .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath26 factorization holds , at least roughly , then each term in @xmath27 can be written    @xmath28\\ w^\\prime[r_{0k}(0)]\\ { \\dot r}_{0j}(t)\\ { \\dot r}_{0k}(0 ) \\right>\\ \\cr\\cr & \\approx&\\ \\left <",

    "this argument can be taken still further .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] what we suggest here is that this latter idea is virtually exact ; that the high - frequency dynamics of a solute - centered correlation function stems almost entirely from the binary dynamics of a single solute - solvent pair  and all we need do is compute the nonlinear , anharmonic dynamics of this pair for each instantaneous liquid configuration .",
    "there are actually a number of kinds of evidence supporting our analysis .",
    "an immediate consequence of our argument is that the binary terms in eq .",
    "( [ g - f - explicit ] ) ought to be significantly larger than the ternary terms at short times . indeed",
    ", exact molecular dynamics simulations have established the overwhelming predominance of the binary contributions to the @xmath27 vibrational relaxation correlation functions .",
    "@xcite interestingly , one finds the predicted strong preferences for the ( presumably ) less collective binary part even when the relaxation takes place in dipolar solvents , liquids whose intermolecular forces are sufficiently long  ranged that the friction @xmath10 itself ends up with major contributions from ternary terms .",
    "@xcite the reasons for this difference between binary and ternary are clear from a short  time perspective . at equilibrium",
    "( @xmath26 ) , the force ",
    "velocity version of the vibrational friction is rigorously binary , because , as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ g - at - time0 ] ) , the velocities of different solvent molecules are rigorously independent . the actual equilibrium friction , by contrast , does not even start out as binary at @xmath26 ; the equilibrium structure of the liquid builds in correlations that have nothing to do with the subsequent dynamical evolution .",
    "but even away from @xmath26 , the wide range of values possible for the couplings serves to explain the observation .",
    "the sheer unlikelihood of having two different solvents so similar in their distance from the solute that they end up making comparable contributions will also prevent much of a ternary presence in the answer .",
    "we can see somewhat more direct evidence of the two - particle character of the essential dynamics by looking in the frequency domain with the aid of inm theory .",
    "inm theories can not addresss any of the truly high - frequency dynamics , but if we confine ourselves to the highest frequencies inside the inm band , we invariably find that the vibrational friction spectrum ( @xmath39 ) is given quantitatively by the portion arising from the motion of the solute and the single largest contributing solvent .",
    "@xcite moreover , as with the molecular dynamics studies , these findings seems to be completely independent of how otherwise collective the solvent motion is .",
    "the question we are left with , therefore , is whether the nature of the relaxation really does change qualitatively as we cross the band edge .",
    "it does not seem all that far fetched for this same two  particle scenario that works so well just inside the band to apply at higher frequencies as well .",
    "to make our subsequent development more concrete , suppose we specialize to the familiar case of a diatomic solute dissolved in an atomic liquid .",
    "taking the atoms of the diatomic to be labeled as 1 and 2 ( with masses @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , and indexing the atoms of the solvent by @xmath42 , we find that if the potential energy of interaction between the solute and the solvent can be written in terms of site - site pair potentials @xmath43 \\ , \\label{v - diatomic } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "let us now consider what the highest frequency parts of the force  velocity correlation function , eq . ( [ g - def ] ) , would look like for such a force .",
    "generalizing our arguments in the previous section , we would expect that the dominant contribution would come ( at most ) from the two solvent atoms , call them @xmath48 and @xmath49 , nearest the two solute sites 1 and 2 ( respectively ) .",
    "@xcite furthermore , given the rapid variation of the site - site potentials @xmath50 in the region of interest , we might also expect the terms involving the second derivative @xmath51 to be far more important than those involving the first derivative @xmath52 .",
    "hence we should be able to express the correlation function as just    @xmath53    with @xmath54 .",
    "we could , in fact , make use of eq .",
    "( [ almost - there ] ) as it stands ; since it requires that we know no more than the dynamics of 4 degrees of freedom , it already represents a major simplification over the full many  body problem .",
    "we can make one last simplification , however .",
    "the variation of the @xmath55 angular factors is also guaranteed to be far smaller than that of the @xmath51 factors at short times , if only because of the small dynamic range of the cosine function ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "for the purposes of evaluating high  frequency behavior it therefore suffices to approximate the cosine by its @xmath26 value .",
    "our final high  frequency expression for the vibrational relaxation correlation function thus reduces to a remarkably simple form @xmath57 relying only on the one  dimensional , purely radial dynamics of two solvent molecules moving with respect to the two solute sites .      of course ,",
    "since we are in a liquid , the exact dynamics of even this small a number of degrees of freedom is still intimately connected with the dynamics of the remainder .",
    "were we unable to achieve any reduction of this dynamics comparable to the simplification we found for the correlation function , there would thus be little practical advantage to our formalism .",
    "fortunately , the same kinds of analysis we have been pursuing also reveal a wonderful dynamical separability : the important solvents end up being dynamically decoupled from the rest of the solvent as well .",
    "this basic notion of dynamical separability is illustrated by looking at the time evolution of a mutual  nearest  neighbor pair of atoms in an atomic liquid .",
    "@xcite the equations of motion for any two atoms @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with masses @xmath58 and @xmath59 , are @xmath60 provided all the atoms interact by pair potentials @xmath61 .",
    "but , if these two particular atoms form a mutual  nearest  neighbor pair , then @xmath62 will be significantly larger than any of the other forces affecting the pair .",
    "hence , to within a high level of accuracy , the relative acceleration will be given by @xmath63 meaning that the scalar displacement @xmath64 will satisfy the differential equation @xmath65 with @xmath66 the reduced mass of the pair .",
    "here the angular velocity factor @xmath67 and we have used the vector identity @xmath68    equation ( [ pair - with - cent ] ) is intriguing , but it is not as simple as it may appear ; the evolution of the centrifugal acceleration term @xmath69 is controlled by other forces besides @xmath62 ( and thus by the motion of other atoms besides @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "however it is fairly easy to see that this term too is almost always going to be negligible compared to the intra ",
    "pair force .",
    "we can estimate its size by using the equipartion theorem to get the mean  square angular velocity  @xcite @xmath70 .",
    "if we take the pair potential to be of the lennard ",
    "jones form , @xmath71 $ ] , and we then make the ( very ) conservative estimate that a typical intra  pair distance @xmath72 , we find that a typical value of the centrifugal force is @xmath73 , whereas a typical intermolecular force is @xmath74 . hence under any liquid ",
    "state conditions , indeed at anything other than the most extreme supercritical conditions , we can safely neglect such centrifugal contributions .",
    "@xcite the dynamics of a mutual  nearest  neighbor pair of atoms is therefore well described by a simple , purely radial , equation of motion : @xmath75 even in a dense liquid .",
    "this same argument can easily be adapted to the vibrational relaxation example we considered in the last section .",
    "if only one atom ( say number 1 ) of our diatomic solute forms a mutual nearest neighbor pair with a solvent atom ( solvent @xmath48 ) , then the equations of motion for the critical solvent atom and for @xmath76 , the position of the diatomic s center of mass , are given accurately by  @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath58 is the mass of the solvent atom , and @xmath78 is the total mass of the solute . for a rigid diatomic ,",
    "though , @xmath79 so that the analogue of eq .",

    "the second , solute ",
    "solvent centrifugal , term in eq .",
    "( [ pair - dyn - with - rots ] ) can be discarded for precisely the same reasons we just went through ; on the average this term is far smaller than the radial force @xmath82 .",
    "the third term seems to present a new case , inasmuch as it arises directly from the rotational motion of the diatomic solute . yet",
    ", we can argue that it too should be small .",
    "barring pathological situations , the interatomic separation and the reduced mass for the diatomic should be comparable to those of a solute  atom / solvent  atom mutual  near  neighbor pair .",
    "we should therefore expect similar results for the centrifugal terms @xmath83 both of which are equal to angular velocity factors on the average @xmath84 and should therefore be small . by the same token , the average rotational term @xmath85 .",
    "but by schwarz s inequality @xmath86 hence , the radial force should dominate both non  radial terms , leaving us with the strikingly simple , one  dimensional equation of motion : @xmath87    in the event that both atoms of the solute are members of mutual  nearest ",

    "we might also predict that , except for very rare liquid configurations , one of the two tagged solvent atoms will be far more important than the other in determining the force along the bond .",

    "this observation is central because it means that we only need to ascertain the dynamics of the solute and the special solvent .",

    "induced situations are precisely the critical ones dominating the high  frequency relaxation dynamics . for the kinds of intermolecular distances and",

    "basic to all of this discussion is our assumption that the critical portion of the time evolution takes place at short times . in part , this assumption is valid because of our concern about high frequencies ,  @xcite but equally , it stems from the short ( few hundred fs ) decay times characteristic of the force  autocorrelation function which serves to determine the vibrational friction . of course , this time scale , as well , has its origin in the same fundamental ideas that we have been discussing .",
    "the harsh repulsive forces lead to a rapid decorrelation of the molecular trajectories and the average over the structural disorder of the liquid washes out any longer  time correlations that might remain .",

    "the fact that the dynamics has a scattering flavor is certainly more reminiscent of the gas phase than the solid state , but what we discovered was that for times this short , the distinctions simply evaporate .",
    "there is no discernable difference between the high  frequency vibrational friction evaluated as a scattering problem and the friction evaluated with instantaneous ",
    "harmonic  vibration  like  bound  state motion .",
    "as long as the coupling is sufficiently nonlinear , harmonics of the fundamental vibration can evidently play the precise role occupied by more impulsive kinematics .",
    "the short answer to our basic question is therefore that we can _ always _ think of solute as resonantly transfering energy to vibrational motions of the solvent ; to the instantaneous normal modes for solute energies within the band of the liquid and to overtones of those modes for higher energies .",
    "this last interpretation is obviously not unique , but it has the conceptual advantage of allowing us to think of the progression from lower to higher vibrational energies as a gradual evolution in the kinds of dynamics the liquid has to bring to bear on the relaxation",
    ".    this continued success of harmonic perspectives on liquid dynamics actually sends yet another message by highlighting one of the issues we raised in the introduction .",
    "it is hardly disputable that understanding anharmonicity is vital to understanding liquid dynamics , but the distinctions between the different flavors of anharmoncity have significant consequences .",
    "if we needed to be able to model the detailed breakdown of the harmonic  mode picture of the underlying dynamics in order to treat vibrational relaxation , we would have had a daunting task in front of us .",
    "indeed , before we launched this work , this worrisome prospect was a legitimate concern ; over the long times that it actually takes a molecule to rid itself of its vibrational energy , individual instantaneous normal modes completely lose any semblance of their original identities .",
    "@xcite what we have discovered , though , is that the primary issue in high - frequency behavior is the nonlinearity of the coupling being driven by the liquid dynamics , not the nonlinearity of the dynamics per se  and that this much more limited variety of anharmonicity is not all that difficult to understand .",
    "this same kind of distinction is actually a rather familiar one to spectroscopists . early on in the history of infrared and raman spectra",
    ", distinctions were drawn between `` mechanical '' and `` electrical '' anharmonicities in the vibrational spectra of individual molecules .",
    "@xcite more recently , however , the issue has been the focus of considerable attention in the context of trying to understanding fifth  order nonresonant raman spectra of liquids as a whole .",
    "@xcite purely harmonic systems would give rigorously zero signal in these experiments , so the very existence of a measurable signal is evidence of anharmonicity . but as okumura and tanimura were quick to point out ,  @xcite the same signals could arise equally well from fundamental liquid  dynamical anharmonicities or from nonlinearities in the polarizability dependence on normal modes ( violations of the placzek approximation ) .",
    "@xcite just as we found here , the contribution of derivatives beyond the first for a spectroscopic probe potential ( whether it be a force on a bond or a many  body polarizability ) can be quite effective in extending the ways a liquid can respond to a probe .",
    "in fact , in perfect analogy to what we saw here , the polarizability nonlinearities can apparently be a much larger determinant of the spectra than the underlying liquid anharmonicities .",
    "@xcite    curiously , the results of this paper seem as if they can also be taken as supporting the independent  binary  collision model of vibrational relaxation .",
    "the centrality of solute  solvent pairs in the process was , if anything , put on firmer microscopic ground by our results . however , there are some key distinctions between ibc theory and what we have presented here .",
    "the most important of these is where the equilibrium considerations stop and where the dynamical concerns take over . within ibc theory",
    "the existence , the precise definition , and , _ a fortiori _ , the rate of collisions all rely heavily on the liquid  state setting . only the collision  induced vibrational relaxation itself is thought to be independent of the medium .",
    "@xcite with our instantaneous  pair model , though , the sole role of the many  body environment is to prescribe the _ equilibrium _ distribution of special ( mutual  nearest  neighbor ) solute  solvent pairs .",
    "these pair distances form the initial configurations for the dynamical calculation , but all of this subsequent dynamics , including the distribution of initial pair velocities , are purely few  body in character .",
    "we should emphasize that these distinctions are not merely technical .",
    "the arbitrariness of ibc theory results from the difficult task it has of solving enough of the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of the solution to extract a cleanly separable pair motion from the remaining background . lacking a definitive solution ,",
    "ibc applications are compelled to adopt ad hoc definitions of collisions , postulating such criteria as minimum collision radii .",
    "@xcite by contrast , the crisp separation with instantaneous pair ideas between many  body equilibrium information and few ",
    "body dynamics , not only removes any need for guesswork , it might even allow for future quantum mechanical treatments of vibrational relaxation based on the relative ease with which we can do two  body quantum scattering calculations .  @xcite    there are some other directions the instantaneous pair theory should be extended in as well .",
    "all of the numerical examples explored here were based on the rather limited possibilities presented by a diatomic solute dissolved in an atomic solvent .",
    "the easiest generalization of this work to polyatomic solutes and solvents would probably have us focus on mutual nearest neighbor pairs between individual solute sites and solvent sites .",
    "however the success of such an approach is far from assured ; sites within a molecule are always going to be strongly correlated .",
    "thus in spite of the strongly binary character already seen in inm vibrational friction spectra with molecular solvents ,  @xcite a fully general version of instantaneous ",
    "pair theory remains to be demonstrated . the potential applicability to understanding how solvents mediate the vibrational energy relaxation of complex multi  mode polyatomics , in particular , presents a natural extension we find especially intriguing .",
