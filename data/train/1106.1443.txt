    "deep x - ray surveys have provided a penetrating probe of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) out to @xmath0  5 ( e.g. ,  brandt & hasinger 2005 ; silverman et  al .",
    "2008 ; brusa et  al . 2009 ; brandt & alexander 2010 ) , identifying obscured and unobscured agn activity in a modest fraction of the field - galaxy population ( @xmath10  510% ; e.g.,lehmer 2005 , 2008 ; xue 2010 ) .",
    "however , there is overwhelming evidence that a large fraction of the heavily obscured agn population ( ) remains undetected in even the deepest x - ray surveys ( e.g. ,  worsley 2005 ; hickox & markevitch 2006 ; tozzi 2006 ; treister 2006 ; see  1 of alexander 2008 ) .",
    "distant heavily obscured agns are predicted by many theoretical models and simulations to represent an important phase in the evolution of distant dust - enshrouded galaxies , where the rapidly growing central supermassive black hole ( bh ) is hidden from view ( e.g. ,  fabian 1999 ; granato 2006 ; hopkins 2006 ) .",
    "therefore the identification of the most heavily obscured agns could be more than just a book - keeping exercise  without having observations sensitive to their identification we may miss a crucial bh growth phase .",
    "weak ( faint or undetected ) x - ray emission from luminous agns is likely to be due to the presence of large amounts of dust / gas , sometimes exceeding @xmath7  @xmath6 ( i.e. ,  compton thick ; e.g. ,  matt 2000 ; comastri 2004 ; della ceca et  al .",
    "2008 ; murphy & yaqoob 2009 ) . strong support for this statement comes from the tight correlation between the optical and x - ray emission of unobscured quasars ( e.g. ,  vignali , brandt , & schneider 2003 ; steffen et  al .",
    "2006 ; gibson 2008 ) , which suggests that all luminous agns are _ intrinsically _ bright at energies .",
    "although weak at x - ray energies , these heavily obscured agns should still be detected in deep mid - to - far infrared ( ir ; rest - frame wavelength @xmath11  @xmath12 m ) observations due to the presence of dust heated by the hidden agn .",
    "indeed , a number of studies have revealed large populations of x - ray undetected ir - bright galaxies at @xmath0  2 , which may host heavily obscured , potentially compton thick , agn activity ( e.g. ,  daddi 2007a ; fiore 2008 , 2009 ; georgantopoulos 2008 , 2011 ; treister 2009 ; georgakakis et  al . 2010 ) .",
    "many of these studies have employed x - ray stacking analyses of x - ray undetected ir galaxies to identify hidden agn populations statistically , where the detection of a hard x - ray spectral slope ( @xmath4 ) in the stacked data provides compelling evidence for the presence of heavily obscured agn activity in at least a fraction of the stacked sources .  1 ( e.g. ,  kim 1992 ; ptak 1999 ; berghea 2008 ; iwasawa 2009 ) . ] under the assumption that all of these x - ray undetected ir galaxies host compton - thick agn activity , the implied space density of these hidden agns would exceed those of the compton - thin agn population by a factor of @xmath10  2 , implying that a much larger fraction of distant luminous agns are compton thick than found locally ( @xmath13  2550% of local agns appear to be compton thick ; see table  2 in burlon et  al .",
    "2010 ; risaliti et  al .",
    "1999 ; guainazzi et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "these discoveries provide some support for the hypothesis that the majority of distant bh growth was more heavily obscured than that found locally ( e.g. ,  la franca 2005 ; treister & urry 2006 ; hasinger 2008 ) .",
    "however , results from x - ray stacking analyses need to be treated with caution since they only provide an average signal , leaving significant uncertainties about the overall distribution of source properties",
    ". therefore , before strong conclusions can be derived from these studies , at least two key questions need to be addressed : ( 1 ) what fraction of the stacked signal is `` contaminated '' by star - forming galaxies , which are found to comprise at least a fraction of the candidate heavily obscured agn population ( e.g.,donley et  al .",
    "2008 ; murphy et  al . 2009",
    "; fadda et  al .",
    "( 2 ) what fraction of the heavily obscured agns are absorbed by compton thick ( as opposed to compton thin ) material ?",
    "the most direct way to address these questions is with deeper x - ray data , which will ( 1 ) reveal the x - ray properties of individual ir - bright galaxies that were previously contributing to the stacked signal , ( 2 ) allow for more detailed x - ray spectral investigations of the x - ray detected ir - bright galaxies to search for the signatures of heavily obscured and compton - thick absorption ( e.g. ,  the identification of a strong reflection component at rest - frame @xmath14  kev ; the detection of a high equivalent width fe  k emission line ; e.g. ,  matt 1996 , 2000 ; tozzi et  al . 2006 ; georgantopoulos 2009 ; comastri 2011 ; feruglio 2011 ; see murphy & yaqoob 2009 ) ,  @xmath15  @xmath6 and compton - thick agns with @xmath7  @xmath6 ( e.g.,murphy & yaqoob 2009 ; yaqoob 2010 ) .",
    "therefore our adopted definition of an compton - thick agn is not comprehensive but it is conventional ; see the mytorus manual at www.mytorus.com for a detailed review . ] and ( 3 ) improve stacking constraints of x - ray undetected populations .",
    "the presence of large amounts of absorption can also be indirectly inferred from the identification of luminous agn emission lines and an ir - emitting hot - dust agn continuum in x - ray weak systems ( e.g. ,  bassani 1999 ; krabbe 2001 ; lutz 2004 ; alexander 2005b , 2008 ; heckman 2005 ; gandhi 2009 ; bauer 2010 ; donley 2010 ; gilli 2010 ; vignali 2010 ; goulding 2011 ) .",
    "greater reliability in the identification of heavily obscured and compton - thick agns is made when considering multiple diagnostics that cross - check each other , particularly those that probe different agn regions .",
    "in this paper we use the deepest x - ray observations available ( the 4  ms _ chandra _ exposure of the _ chandra _ deep field - south ; cdf - s ; xue 2011 ) to extend the analyses of daddi ( 2007a ) , which employed x - ray stacking techniques to study x - ray undetected ir - bright @xmath0  2 galaxies in the shallower 1  ms cdf - s observations .",
    "daddi ( 2007b ) utilized the @xmath2 photometric - selection technique ( daddi 2004 ) to identify @xmath1 galaxies at @xmath0  1.42.6 and classified objects based on the ratio of mid - ir ( 24  @xmath12 m ) to extinction - corrected ultra - violet ( uv ; rest - frame 1500   ) star - formation rates ( sfrs ) .",

    "the flat x - ray spectral slope found for the ir - excess galaxies indicates that a fraction of the x - ray undetected ir - excess galaxy population host heavily obscured agn activity , some of which may be compton thick ; by comparison , the stacked x - ray emission from the x - ray undetected ir - normal galaxies is consistent with that expected from star formation . under the assumption that all of the ir - excess galaxies are compton - thick agns , daddi ( 2007a )",

    "2010 ) as part of the catalog construction in xue ( 2011 ) ; see  3.2 of xue ( 2011 ) for more details .    due to the limited counting statistics for the majority of the heavily obscured agns ( @xmath13  80 counts in the band ; see table  2 ) , which are the primary focus of this paper , the x - ray spectral analyses were predominantly performed using the @xmath41-statistic ( cash 1979 ) .",

    "we analysed the x - ray variability of the x - ray detected _ bzk _ galaxies to look for nuclear activity .",

    "we apply a @xmath43 test to determine if a source is variable by comparing the variability observed between observations to that expected from poisson statistics .",

    "the test statistic is smaller than expected and does not follow the @xmath43 distribution .",
    "we construct a monte carlo simulation to determine what distribution the test statistic should follow for each source , following the procedure of paolillo et al .",
    "the observed test statistic is compared to the simulated distribution to determine the probability ( @xmath44 ) that the observed variability is due to poisson noise .",

    "a source is considered variable if it has @xmath45 counts in the 0.58  kev band and @xmath44 @xmath46 5% .",
    "the normalized excess variance ( @xmath47 ; nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) measures how strongly each source varies in excess of measurement error .",
    "since it is more likely that a variable galaxy harbors an agn if the observed variability exceeds that expected from a population of x - ray binaries , we estimate the amount of variability expected from high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "hmxb variability can be estimated from a galaxy s star formation rate ( see fig .  8 of gilfanov et al .",
    "2004 ) . to use this relation",

    "this value is the maximum variability expected for a hmxb population .",
    "variability strength will increase with the length of the timescale over which it is measured ( e.g. ,  nandra 1997 ) , so adopting the maximum hmxb variability is appropriate for cdf - s sources at @xmath0  2 , where rest - frame timescales are @xmath3  3  years .",
    "the sfr of the _ bzk _ galaxies was estimated from their uv and ir luminosities ( xue et al . 2010 ) . applying the @xmath48-sfr relations ( gilfanov et al .",
    "2004 ) , we calculate an upper limit to the hmxb contribution to the variability , reported as @xmath49 in table  2 . a source is considered to be an x - ray variable agn if it is found to be variable , as prescribed above , and also has excess variability over that expected from hmxbs .",
    "on the basis of these criteria , 13 of the 27 sources with @xmath45 counts in the 0.58  kev band are found to be variable agn .",
    "we used x - ray stacking analyses to constrain the average x - ray properties of the x - ray undetected @xmath2 galaxy populations . in our x - ray stacking analyses we adopted the procedure of lehmer ( 2008 ) , which takes a different approach from the worsley ( 2005 ) method used by daddi ( 2007a ) .",
    "both procedures stack the x - ray data of the selected sources but lehmer ( 2008 ) determine the background counts using large source - free apertures local to each source while worsley ( 2005 ) determine the background counts from a large number of randomly placed apertures around the source ( i.e.,a monte - carlo approach ) .",
    "we tested both procedures on our datasets and achieved statistically consistent results .",
    "the major advantage of the lehmer ( 2008 ) approach over that of worsley ( 2005 ) is computational speed . in the stacking analyses , we used a fixed aperture of @xmath32 radius and",

    "we applied aperture corrections to the net stacked count rates following  4.2 in lehmer ( 2008 ) .",
