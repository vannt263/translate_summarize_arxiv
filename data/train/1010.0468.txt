    "the transversity of hadrons has been one of the most important issues well over decades ( see a recent review  @xcite ) , since it allows one to get access to their spin structures .",
    "it is pertinent to the tensor current of hadrons and is very difficult to be measured experimentally , because there is no direct probe to measure it . only very recently",
    ", it was suggested that the transverse spin asymmetry @xmath1 in drell - yan processes in @xmath2 reactions @xcite as well as the azimuthal single spin asymmetry in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) @xcite can be used to obtain information on the transversity of the nucleon .",
    "though it is even more difficult to measure the transversity of the pion experimentally , it is still of great significance to understand it , since it provides the internal spin structure due to quarks , i.e. it accommodates a novel concept called _ a hadron tomography_. the first result of the pion transversity on lattice has been reported by the qcdsf / ukqcd collaborations  @xcite .",
    "they also presented the probability density of the polarized quarks inside the pion , combining the electromagnetic form factor of the pion  @xcite with its tensor form factor .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that when the quarks are transversely polarized , their spatial distribution is strongly distorted .",
    "this first result in the lattice qcd has triggered several subsequent theoretical works  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the tensor form factors of the pion have been studied within the local and nonlocal nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , a direct comparison with the lattice results being emphasized . in doing so , they employed a larger value of the pion mass , i.e. @xmath3 mev such that the results can be confronted with the lattice data .",
    "they also considered the case of the chiral limit .    in the present work ,",
    "we first want to investigate the pion tensor form factor in the space - like momentum transfer region ( @xmath4 gev ) , based on the low - energy effective chiral action ( e@xmath5a ) from the instanton vacuum  @xcite . combining the result of the tensor form factor with the electromagnetic one of the pion which was already studied in ref .",
    "@xcite within the same framework , we then derive the probability density of transversely polarized quarks inside the pion .",
    "since the instanton vacuum realizes the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath5sb ) naturally via quark zero modes , it may provide a good framework to study properties of the pion such as the electromagnetic and tensor form factors .",
    "moreover , an important merit of this approach lies in the fact that there are only two parameters , that is , the average ( anti)instanton size @xmath6 fm and average inter - instanton distance @xmath7 fm .",
    "the normalization point is given by the average size of instantons and is approximately equal to @xmath8 gev .",
    "the values of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 were estimated many years ago phenomenologically in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as theoretically in ref .",
    "the instanton framework has been proved to be reliable in reproducing experimental data especially for the meson sector , such as the meson distribution amplitudes  @xcite , semileptonic decays  @xcite , and etc .",
    "furthermore , this approach was supported by various lattice simulations of the qcd vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the quark propagator from the instanton vacuum  @xcite is in a remarkable agreement with lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "finally the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum has a practical virtue , since it does not have any adjustable parameter once the above - mentioned two parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are determined .",
    "we organize the present work as follows : in section ii , we briefly explain the definitions of the probability densities of the transversely polarized quarks , which are expressed in terms of generalized form factors of the pion . in section iii , we show how to calculate the tensor form factors within the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum . in section",
    "iv , the numerical results are discussed and compared with those in lattice qcd .",
    "the final section is devoted to summarize the present work , to draw conclusions , and to give outlook .",
    "in this section , we define the probability density of transversely polarized quarks inside the pion . for definiteness , we choose the positively charged pion @xmath11 from now on .",
    "the probability density of transversely polarized quarks for the @xmath12 th moment of the probability density is given as @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denote the impact parameter that measures the distance from the center of momentum of the pion to the quark in the transverse plane to its motion .",
    "the @xmath15 stands for the fixed transverse spin of the quark . for simplicity , we choose the @xmath16 direction for the quark longitudinal momentum .",
    "the @xmath17 indicates the momentum fraction possessed by the quark inside the pion .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are called the generalized form factors ( gffs ) .",
    "in fact , the gffs are just the moments of the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) for the unpolarized and transversely polarized pions , respectively : @xmath20 for the first moment , the gffs @xmath21 and @xmath22 are identified with the electromagnetic and tensor form factors of the pion , respectively .",
    "previously , we have studied @xmath23 in the momentum space within the nonlocal chiral quark model ( nl@xmath5qm ) from the instanton vacuum  @xcite , resulting in a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "hence , we can readily calculate @xmath24 , using the results of ref .",
    "thus , we will concentrate on calculating the tensor form factors @xmath25 within the same framework , and they can be written in a general form as follows : @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for the initial and final on - shell momenta of the pion , respectively .",

    "we also introduce a notation @xmath42 , where @xmath43 indicates the su(@xmath44 ) covariant derivative .",
    "since we are interested in the spatial distribution of the transversely polarized quark inside the pion , we need to consider the fourier transform of the form factors : @xmath45 where @xmath46 designates the generic pion form factor .",
    "the magnitudes of the transverse momentum and impact parameter are expressed as @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , the fourier transform of the derivative of the gff with respect to @xmath49 can be evaluated as : @xmath50 the @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eqs.([eq : ft],[eq : dft ] ) denote the bessel functions of order @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . according to the definitions for the relevant vectors @xmath55 and @xmath14 , the probability density in eq .",

    "we are able to average the fermionic determinant over collective coordinates of instantons with fermionic quasi - particles , i.e. the constituent quarks introduced .",
