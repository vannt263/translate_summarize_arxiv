    "<S> we present the recent investigation on the effect of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the spin structure of the octet baryons .    </S>",
    "<S> -3.5 in 3.3 in    the spin structure of the nucleon has been a hot issue since the measurement of the first moment of the proton spin structure function @xmath0  @xcite by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the emc result indicates that the strange quark is polarized in the opposite direction to other light quarks . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the spin of the nucleon is not carried by quarks only . while it is now known that a large fraction of the nucleon spin is provided by gluons and their orbital angular momenta , it is still very important to understand the mechanism of how the quarks carry the nucleon spin . </S>",
    "<S> the information on the nucleon spin carried by quarks comes from two different sources : the first moment of the spin structure function @xmath1 of the proton and the experimental data of hyperon semileptonic decay ( hsd ) . with su(3 ) </S>",
    "<S> symmetry assumed , one obtains two reduced matrix elements @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> taking for @xmath4 and for @xmath5 , one gets for the proton : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which implies @xmath9 , quite a small number as compared with the naive expectation from the quark model : @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the spin content of the @xmath11 hyperon has drawn attention to us . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the nucleon , the nonrelativistic quark model predicts that the spin of the @xmath11 comes solely from the strange quark , since the up and down quarks constitute the spin singlet . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the @xmath12 is deeply related to the fragmentation funtion which can be measured experimentally  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    however , note that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are _ not directly measured_. the standard way to extract @xmath15 is to assume the su(3 ) symmetry for hsd . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it is enough to take _ any _ two decays and data of deep inelastic scattering as input . </S>",
    "<S> with su(3 ) symmetry assumed , one can pick out two different values of the constants of hsd among the existing data . </S>",
    "<S> one normally uses neutron and @xmath16 @xmath17 decays as an input . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the su(3 ) symmetry breaking were not important , any pair out of the six known hsd constants would give roughly the same number for @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this is , however , _ not _ the case . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the effect of su(3 ) symmetry breaking in hsd is not at all small . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the uncertainty of the hsd constant for @xmath18 is noticeably larger than those for the other processes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is still of great significance to understand the effect of su(3 ) symmetry breaking on the quark - spin content of the nucleon .    in order to analyze the symmetry breaking in weak decays , it is inevitable to resort to some specific model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the chiral quark - soliton model(@xmath19qsm ) : see ref.@xcite and references therein ) to incorporate the su(3 ) symmetry breaking into the semileptonic decays . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19qsm satisfactorily describes the axial - vector properties of hyperons ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein . ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the symmetry breaking pattern of the @xmath19qsm is identical to the one derived in large @xmath20 qcd @xcite , our analysis is in fact much more general than the model itself . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we employ the experimental data for hsd in order to fix the dynamical variables in the model , so that we can minimize the model - dependence of the present study .    however , since @xmath21b@xmath22 does not correspond to the su(3 ) octet axial - vector current , a further assumption is required to connect it to the octet axial - vector constants . the @xmath19qsm ( as most of the hedgehog models ) has a remarkable virtue of connecting the @xmath21b@xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the semileptonic decay constants in a direct manner . </S>",
    "<S> this connection introduces a model dependence into our analysis . however , there is no significant numerical difference between the results obtained with and without this model dependent ingredient  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we would like to report in brief the recent investigation on the effect of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking , based on refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , to which we refer for details .    figure 1 shows the dependence of the integrated quark densities @xmath25 of the nucleon on the strange quark mass @xmath26 , of which definitions can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite :        while the up and down quark densities have smaller errors as @xmath27 increases , the uncertainty of the @xmath28 becomes much larger . with @xmath29 mev </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that @xmath28 is in practice undetermined . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the error of the semileptonic decay constant for the process @xmath31 propagates strongly in the @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 plots the flavor decomposition of the quark - spin content of the @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> as in the case of the nucleon , the error of the @xmath32 is noticeable with @xmath27 increased .        </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 depicts the splitting of the @xmath33s due to the strange quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> the result is according to the following equation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the third component of the spin operator . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27 stands for the strange quark mass which plays a role of breaking su(3 ) symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 is the matrix element of the su(3 ) wigner function . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath37 denote the dynamical variables from the model which are fixed by the hsd data . </S>",
    "<S> they appear also in the octet axial - vector constants , which makes it possible to link the octet axial - vector constants to the octet one .        actually , the simplest version of the sykrme model without vector mesons gives @xmath38 . in the case of the @xmath19qsm provides nonzero @xmath39 . in the limit of the large soliton </S>",
    "<S> , the ratio of @xmath40 goes to zero , which is in agreement with ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the size of the soliton becomes closer to zero , which corresponds to the limit of the nonrelativistic quark model , @xmath41 turns out be one , as it should be . </S>",
    "<S> the removal of the degeneracy in @xmath42s comes from the second term in eq.([ga0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the @xmath43 and @xmath14 show relatively mild dependence on @xmath27 , the @xmath44 and @xmath45 depend quite strongly on @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> large error bars with @xmath27 is due to the propagation of the uncertainty in @xmath46 decay to the variables @xmath37 . from figure 3 </S>",
    "<S> , we find a very interesting thing . </S>",
    "<S> with the effect of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking , @xmath14 and @xmath44 get larger and finally quite closer to one . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that the spins of @xmath11 and @xmath46 are almost carried by quarks . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath11 and @xmath46 behave more `` nonrelativistically '' . </S>",
    "<S> hence , extracting the @xmath47 from the experimental data as precisely as possible and comparing it with that of the nucleon , one would see the effect of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking , explicitly .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented in this talk a recent investigation on the effect of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking within the framework of the chiral quark - soliton model , incorporating the experimental data of hyperon semileptonic decay . because of the large uncertainty in the data for the @xmath46 decay , one is not able to determine the @xmath48 , which means that one can not tell for sure about how much the strange quark carries the nucleon spin .    </S>",
    "<S> the su(3 ) symmetry breaking removes the degeneracy of the @xmath49s . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , knowing the difference between the @xmath43 and @xmath47 will bring out the effect of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 and @xmath46 behave more `` nonrelativistically '' than the nucleon .    in order to determine the spin content of the su(3 ) baryons carried by quarks </S>",
    "<S> , it is highly required to reduce the experimental data of @xmath46 semileptonic decay . </S>"
