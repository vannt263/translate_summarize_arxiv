    "the study of large random matrices and their eigenvalues is one of the primary themes of current research in probability .",
    "it finds applications in such diverse fields as number theory , random partitions , free probability and operator algebras , high - dimensional statistical analysis , nuclear physics , signal processing , wireless communication , quantum percolation , and the operation of search engines .",
    "some recent book length expositions are @xcite .",
    "the objects of interest in this field are usually random real symmetric or complex hermitian matrices .",
    "for example , one of the most popular models is the _ gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) _ , where the matrices are hermitian , the entries above the diagonal are independent , identically distributed , standard complex gaussian random variables , and the entries on the diagonal are independent , identically distributed , standard real gaussian random variables .",
    "much is now known about the asymptotic behavior of objects such as the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues and the behavior of the maximal eigenvalue .    here",
    "we investigate random matrices with substantially greater structure and complexity than the gue , namely the adjacency matrices of random graphs , although our methods are also applicable to the closely related laplacian matrices .",
    "the recent availability of large amounts of data has led to an explosion in the number of models used to model real - world networks , and dynamically grown models such as various preferential attachment schemes have attracted significant interest from the computer science and mathematical physics community .",
    "it is known ( see , for example , the monographs @xcite ) that a surprising diversity of features of a graph are determined , at least in part , by the behavior of the eigenvalues of its adjacency and laplacian matrices .",
    "we concentrate on the adjacency matrices of various ensembles of random trees .",
    "random trees arise in numerous contexts , ranging from the analysis of database and search algorithms in computer science to models of phylogenies ( that is , evolutionary family trees ) in biology . moreover , many of the preferential attachment schemes for networks are also largely random models of growing trees ( see , for example , @xcite for a survey of some of the more popular schemes ) .",
    "we note that , although trees are rather simple graphs , the analysis of their eigenvalues is still rather challenging , and even in the case of highly symmetric deterministic trees explicit formulae for spectra have only been found recently @xcite .",
    "we introduce a general technique based on the concept of _ probability fringe convergence _ for showing that the _ spectral distributions _ ( that is , empirical distributions of the eigenvalues ) of the adjacency matrices of an ensemble of random trees converge in the topology of weak convergence of probability measures on the line to a deterministic limit as the number of vertices goes to infinity , and we show how this technique applies in several natural examples .    the notion of probability fringe convergence is a type of _ local weak convergence _ for random graphs that involves the convergence in distribution of suitably defined neighborhoods of a vertex picked uniformly from a random graph as the size of the graph goes to infinity .",
    "surveys of this general methodology are @xcite .",
    "such convergence results for random trees where the limit is described in terms of a continuous - time branching processes go back to @xcite .",
    "the first ( to our knowledge ) use of such techniques in various general models of preferential attachment is @xcite .",
    "such notions are further explored in @xcite",
    ".    the key algebraic element of our proof of convergence of the spectral distributions is the set of interlacing inequalities between the eigenvalues of a hermitian matrix and the eigenvalues of one of its principal sub - matrices .",
    "the interlacing inequalities allow us to break a large tree up into a forest of smaller trees by deleting a small proportion of edges and conclude that the spectral distribution of the tree is close to that of the forest which , in turn , is a convex combination of the spectral distributions of its component sub - trees .",
    "if the decomposition into a forest is done appropriately , then the resulting sub - trees are `` locally defined '' in a sense that allows probability fringe convergence to be brought to bear to show that the spectral distribution of the forest converges .",
    "we note that interlacing has found other applications in algebraic graph theory @xcite .",
    "another interesting technical aspect of our work is that the _ method of moments _ , one of the most commonly used tools in random matrix theory , fails for some natural ensembles because , as we observe in subsection  [ subsec : conv_spec_dist ] , expected values of moments of the spectral distribution go to infinity .",
    "while our method for showing that the spectral distribution converges is quite general , it does not provide any sort of characterization of the limiting distribution . in section  [ s : comb_example ]",
    "we look at an extremely simple random tree that is obtained by taking the tree consisting of a path of @xmath4 points and independently connecting an edge to each point with equal probability , so that the resulting tree resembles a comb with some of its teeth missing .",
    "our probability fringe convergence methodology does not apply immediately to this ensemble of random trees , but a straightforward modification of it does .",
    "we compute the asymptotic moments of the spectral distribution for this ensemble and show that even in this simple case the answer is rather intricate , indicating that we should perhaps not expect simple characterizations of the limit for more complex models .",
    "quite closely related to our results for the spectral distribution is the recent work @xcite , where similar local weak convergence techniques are combined with stieltjes transform methods to prove various limiting results for families of random graphs .",
    "we extend our results on the convergence of the spectral distribution in two different directions .",
    "first , we show for any @xmath5 that the proportion of eigenvalues that have the value @xmath6 converges to a constant under the assumption of probability fringe convergence .",
    "moreover , we give a simple sufficient condition for the limit to be positive and apply this condition to show for several models that the limiting spectral distribution has a set of atoms that is dense in @xmath7 .",
    "we pay particular attention to the proportion of zero eigenvalues , a quantity of importance in areas such as quantum percolation @xcite .",
    "it is possible to obtain much more exact information on the limiting proportion because of the connection between the number of zero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of a tree and the cardinality of a maximal matching . in particular",
    ", we use a simplified version of the karp - sipser algorithm @xcite to construct maximal matchings .",
    "we also use our methods to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the total weight of a maximal weighted matching when the edge weights are given by independent , identically distributed , non - negative random variables .",
    "second , we obtain results on the joint convergence in distribution of the suitably normalized @xmath1 largest eigenvalues for the preferential attachment tree .",
    "these results extend and sharpen those in @xcite , where it was shown that the @xmath1 largest eigenvalues are asymptotically equivalent to the square roots of the @xmath1 largest out - degrees .",
    "the weak convergence of the suitably rescaled maximum out - degree was obtained in @xcite using martingale methods .",
    "however it is not clear how to extend this technique to describe the asymptotics for the @xmath1 largest out - degrees for @xmath8 .",
    "we prove our more general results using an approach that is essentially completely different .",
    "an enormous number of random tree models have been developed by computer scientists working on the analysis of algorithms and the mathematical modeling of real world networks : see @xcite for a description of some of the more popular models . although our methods apply quite generally , it will be useful to have the following models in mind when it comes to checking how the hypotheses of our results may be verified in particular instances .",

    "the key to understanding the asymptotic properties of the spectra of random trees such as those introduced in section  [ sec : tree - models ] is that they converge `` locally '' to appropriate locally finite infinite trees .",
    "we define the relevant notion of local convergence in this section , and then show how it applies to the models of section  [ sec : tree - models ] .",
    "we first need to be precise about what we mean by the term _ finite rooted tree_. so far , we have talked about trees as particular types of graphs .",
    "that is , we have thought of a tree as being described by a finite set of vertices and a finite set of edges that are unordered pairs of vertices .",
    "a rooted tree has then been defined as such an object with a particular distinguished vertex that we call the root .",
    "this point of view is useful for describing constructions of random trees .",
    "however , we will often wish to consider two trees as being the same if they are _ isomorphic _ in the usual graph - theoretic sense : that is , if they have the same _ shape _ and only differ by a labeling of the vertices .",
    "a tree in this latter sense is thus an isomorphism class of trees thought of as graphs .",
    "when we wish to distinguish these two notions we will use standard terminology and speak of _ labeled _ and _ unlabeled _ trees , respectively . continuing in this vein , we take two rooted trees ( thought of as graphs ) to be the same if there is a graph - theoretic isomorphism from one to the other that preserves the root , and we call the corresponding equivalence classes _ unlabeled rooted trees_. even more generally , we may consider unlabeled trees with several distinguished vertices .",
