    "magnetic fields of interstellar molecular clouds are widely believed to have significant effect on star formation . for an oblate cloud or cloud core of mass @xmath14 contracted along field lines to some extent",
    ", there is a critical value for its magnetic flux @xmath15 given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant and @xmath18 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "a cloud ( core ) with @xmath19 can not be kept in hydrostatic equilibrium by the magnetic force alone ( this state is widely called magnetically supercritical ) , and one with @xmath20 ( magnetically subcritical ) can be in equilibrium if its expansion is suppressed by external magnetic fields . applying the virial theorem to such clouds ,",
    "strittmatter ( 1966 ) found @xmath18 between 4.9 and 9.4 depending on the flatness of the cloud . from some numerical cloud models",
    "mouschovias & spitzer ( 1976 ) obtained @xmath21 , and tomisaka , ikeuchi , & nakamura ( 1988 ) got @xmath22 .",
    "li & shu ( 1996 ) found @xmath23 for self - similar , singular , isothermal clouds .",
    "we can define the critical magnetic field strength of the cloud ( core ) by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radius of the cloud ( core ) perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction and @xmath26 is the mean column density of the cloud ( core ) along field lines .",
    "of course @xmath27 is equivalent to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the mean field strength in the cloud ( core ) .",
    "nakano & nakamura ( 1978 ) found that isothermal disks penetrated by uniform magnetic fields @xmath30 perpendicular to the disk layers are gravitationally unstable only when @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is given by equation ( [ bcr ] ) with @xmath23 .",
    "the critical wavelength , below which the disk is unstable , decreases as @xmath33 decreases ( @xcite ) .",
    "these mean that with perturbations at least the disk as a whole can contract perpendicular to field lines when @xmath31 .",
    "while magnetic fluxes of clouds estimated by observations are not much smaller than their critical values , or @xmath34 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , magnetic stars with mean surface fields of 1 kg to 30 kg have ratios @xmath35 ( @xcite ) . for ordinary stars like the sun with mean surface fields of @xmath36 g , @xmath37 is as small as @xmath38 .",
    "this suggests that cloud cores must lose most of their initial magnetic fluxes at some stages of star formation . at what stages and by what mechanisms ?",
    "this is called the magnetic flux problem in star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ohmic dissipation is too slow to dissipate magnetic fields in molecular clouds of ordinary densities .",
    "for example , for the ionization fraction @xmath38 at density @xmath39 ( figure 1 ) and the length scale of magnetic fields , @xmath40pc , about the jeans length at this density and temperature @xmath41k , we obtain the ohmic dissipation time @xmath42yr , larger than the age of the universe by orders of magnitude .",
    "mestel & spitzer ( 1956 ) found another process of decreasing magnetic flux , which is now widely called ambipolar diffusion ( sometimes called plasma drift ; see appendix  [ termin ] for the terminology ) and is much more efficient than ohmic dissipation in molecular clouds of ordinary densities . in this",
    "process ions ( and electrons ) , which are well frozen to magnetic fields , drift in the sea of neutral molecules together with magnetic fields at a terminal velocity with which the magnetic force balances with the frictional force exerted by the neutrals .",
    "because some dust grains in clouds are electrically charged and interact with magnetic fields , they contribute to controlling the drift of magnetic fields as well as ions .",
    "however , because grains are not so strongly coupled with magnetic fields as ions due to their large masses , complete freezing is not a good approximation in most situations .",
    "more accurate treatment is required for their motion ( @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the size and the mass of grains are distributed in wide ranges ( e.g. , mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 , referred to as mrn hereafter ) , and the degree of freezing depends sensitively on their masses .",
    "more accurate treatment is also necessary for ions because even ions are not well frozen at high densities .",
    "nakano ( 1984 ) and nakano & umebayashi ( 1986 , referred to as @xcite hereafter ) formulated a method of describing the drift of magnetic fields in clouds containing any kinds of charged particles which are coupled with magnetic fields at arbitrary strengths .    using this formalism we investigated the time scale of magnetic flux loss , @xmath2 , from a major part of a cloud ( core ) as a function of the mean density of the cloud ( core ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; nishi , nakano , & umebayashi 1991 , referred to as @xcite hereafter ) .",
    "we have found that there is a critical value @xmath43 hydrogen nuclei per @xmath44 for the density of the cloud , @xmath9 , at which @xmath2 is equal to the free - fall time @xmath45 of the cloud ( core ) ; @xmath46 holds only at @xmath47 , and @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "we have called this the decoupling density because extensive flux loss occurs only at @xmath50 .",
    "our previous results show that at @xmath51 , @xmath2 is 10 to @xmath52 times @xmath45 for @xmath53 and a relation @xmath54 approximately holds at least for @xmath55 .",
    "the relation @xmath54 is characteristic to ambipolar diffusion which occurs when the dominant charged particles are well frozen to magnetic fields ( see  [ limitingcase ] for details ) .",
    "as the density increases at @xmath56 , @xmath2 becomes more and more insensitive to @xmath4 , and finally at @xmath13 , @xmath2 becomes almost independent of @xmath4 , reminiscent of ohmic dissipation .",
    "recently desch & mouschovias ( 2001 ) wrote that ambipolar diffusion was the dominant process even at densities several orders of magnitude higher than @xmath57 .",
    "these results may cause confusion . besides",
    ", the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath9 and @xmath4 described above is rather complicated .",
    "it would be necessary to clarify what is going on especially at high densities .",
    "furthermore , although it was pointed out that grains play an important role in the process of magnetic flux loss , it does not seem to be widely recognized how important they are .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify detailed mechanisms operating in the loss of magnetic flux in molecular clouds especially at high densities and to show how the grains behave . in ",
    "2 we summarize some of the formulae obtained by nakano ( 1984 ) and @xcite , which will be used in this paper . in ",
    "3 we show numerical results and analyze in detail the processes going on especially at high densities .",
    "discussion is made in  4 , and summary is given in  5 . in appendix  [ anotherform ]",
    "we show another method of the formulation than that of nakano ( 1984 ) and @xcite .",
    "we summarize some of the formulae obtained by nakano ( 1984 ) and @xcite , which will be used in this paper .",
    "we consider a cloud which is composed mainly of neutral molecules and atoms but contains a slight amount of charged particles such as various atomic and molecular ions , electrons , and grains of various sizes and charges .    because each kind of charged particles are scarce , we can neglect in its equation of motion the pressure force , the gravity , and the inertia term compared with the lorentz force and the frictional force exerted by the neutrals . with this approximation",
    "we obtain the drift velocity ( velocity of the guiding center ) @xmath58 of an arbitrary particle @xmath59 of mass @xmath60 and electric charge @xmath61 relative to the neutrals .",
    "we adopt the local cartesian coordinate system with the @xmath62-axis parallel to the local magnetic field vector @xmath30 and the @xmath63-axis along the magnetic force @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the electric current density and @xmath66 is the light velocity .",
    "the components of the drift velocity @xmath58 are given by @xmath67 @xmath68 here , @xmath69 is the viscous damping time of the motion of particle @xmath59 in the sea of the neutrals , whose expressions are given , e.g. , by nakano ( 1984 ) for various particles , @xmath70 is the gyrofrequency ( defined to be negative for negatively charged particles ) , @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the mass and number densities , respectively , of particle @xmath75 , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are pedersen and hall conductivities , respectively ( see appendix  [ anotherform ] ) .",
    "summation in equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) is for all kinds of charged particles ; particles having different values of @xmath78 or @xmath79 are different kinds .",
    "the component @xmath80 is not necessary because the drift along field lines has no effect on the magnetic flux loss .",
    "the drift velocity of magnetic fields , @xmath81 , is defined as the velocity relative to the neutrals of each point on an arbitrary closed contour in the cloud with which the magnetic flux through the contour is conserved .",
    "this requires @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the component of the electric field @xmath84 perpendicular to @xmath30 in the frame moving with the neutrals . using the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath84 , or the equation of motion",
    ", we obtain @xmath85 @xmath86 the rate of magnetic flux loss is determined by @xmath87 alone ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is self - evident for axisymmetric clouds because the local @xmath88-axis is in the azimuthal direction .",
    "therefore , the subscript @xmath63 of @xmath87 and @xmath89 may be omitted in the following .",
    "using equations ( [ vlx ] ) and ( [ vly ] ) we can calculate the electric current density in the ( @xmath90 ) plane , @xmath91 . with the electrical neutrality relation @xmath92",
    ", we can easily show that @xmath93 , which is consistent with the definition of the @xmath63-axis , and that @xmath94 is equal to the component perpendicular to @xmath30 of @xmath95 which appears in equations ( [ vlx ] ) and ( [ vly ] ) .",
    "thus the formulation has been consistently done .",
    "consistency of equations ( [ vbx ] ) and ( [ vby ] ) with equations ( [ vlx ] ) and ( [ vly ] ) can be confirmed by considering the motion of a test particle which is completely frozen to magnetic fields and drifts with magnetic fields .",
    "taking a limit @xmath96 reduces equations ( [ vlx ] ) and ( [ vly ] ) to equations ( [ vbx ] ) and ( [ vby ] ) , respectively , because @xmath97 and @xmath98 are not affected by the test particle .    in this formalism",
    "we have neglected the effect of charge fluctuation of grains caused by sticking of ions and electrons on their motion because nakano & umebayashi ( 1980 ) and @xcite had a rough estimation that this effect is small .",
    "more elaborate discussion on this effect will be given in  [ cfluct ] .",
    "we have also neglected the collision between charged particles , whose effect is negligibly small compared with the effect of their collision with the neutrals as shown in appendix  [ collision ] .    with the approximation made on the motion of charged particles ,",
    "the magnetic force on charged particles must balance with the frictional force exerted on them by the neutrals , or by components @xmath99 @xmath100 it is easy to confirm that @xmath58 given by equations ( [ vlx ] ) and ( [ vly ] ) satisfies these equations .    one may simply think that the quantity @xmath101 would characterize the degree of freezing of particle @xmath59 to magnetic fields . however , we have from equations ( [ vlx ] ) and ( [ vbx ] ) @xmath102 when @xmath103 , the degree of freezing , or the relative drift velocity , is certainly determined by @xmath104 alone as @xmath105 $ ] because @xmath106 is at most several at least in the ranges of density and field strength covered by this paper .",
    "however , when @xmath107 is not much larger than 1 , the relative drift velocity may be greatly affected by the second term in the parentheses of equation ( [ vlvb ] ) , or by other charged particles .",
    "we shall show some examples of this effect in   [ bdependence ] and [ contgrain ] .    making use of equations ( [ elecfield ] ) , ( [ vbx ] ) , and ( [ vby ] )",
    ", @xcite showed that the electric field @xmath108 in the frame wherein the neutrals move with a velocity @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the electric conductivity parallel to magnetic field lines , and @xmath112 @xmath113 the work @xmath114 gives the dissipation rate of magnetic energy per unit volume .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ e0 ] ) causes amplification of magnetic fields by fluid motion .",
    "the second term leads to ohmic dissipation .",
    "the third term yields no work .",
    "the last term gives rise to the dissipation in excess of ohmic dissipation ; ambipolar diffusion in excess of ohmic dissipation is given by this term when the dominant charged particles are well frozen to magnetic fields .",
    "thus the ratio of the last term to the second term in equation ( [ e0 ] ) @xmath115 gives the excess dissipation relative to ohmic dissipation ( @xcite ) .",
    "in appendix  [ anotherform ] we show another method of obtaining these formulae than that adopted by nakano ( 1984 ) and @xcite .",
    "because the drift velocity @xmath87 is expressed in terms of the complicated quantities @xmath97 and @xmath98 , it would be worthwhile to show how magnetic fields drift in some limiting cases .    when the dominant charged particles are well frozen to magnetic fields , or @xmath116 , equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) give @xmath117 , and thus these particles drift at almost the same velocity irrespective of their charges as seen from equation ( [ vlx ] ) .",
    "these relations also reduce equation ( [ vbx ] ) to @xmath118 this can also be obtained by replacing @xmath89 with @xmath87 in equation ( [ frictionx ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ vbambi ] ) means that the charged particles drift together with magnetic fields with the terminal velocity at which the magnetic force balances with the frictional force exerted by the neutrals .",
    "this is the generalization of ambipolar diffusion investigated first by mestel & spitzer ( 1956 ) , who considered only ions as the transmitter of the magnetic force to the neutrals . because the magnetic force balances with the gravitational force perpendicular to field lines when @xmath53 , the mean magnetic force in an oblate cloud with @xmath119 can be given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the mean density and the mean column density along field lines , respectively , of the cloud . from equations ( [ vbambi ] ) and ( [ magforce ] ) we have @xmath123 , and",
    "then the magnetic flux loss time from the major part of the cloud , defined as the time required to drift a length scale @xmath124 of magnetic fields , @xmath125 .",
    "this is characteristic to ambipolar diffusion in magnetically supercritical clouds .    when ions are the major contributors to the left - hand side of equation ( [ vbambi ] ) , whose mass @xmath126 is much larger than that of an h@xmath127 molecule and whose viscous damping time is given by @xmath128 with the collision rate coefficient @xmath129 ( @xcite ) , we have @xmath130 for nearly spherical clouds with @xmath131 insofar as @xmath119",
    "this is a well - known expression of the ambipolar diffusion time for magnetically supercritical clouds , which is proportional to the ionization fraction @xmath132 .    if there exists a magnetically subcritical cloud core ( @xmath133 ) in equilibrium owing to external magnetic fields which suppress its expansion , the magnetic force therein almost balances with the gravity , or @xmath134 though this must be significantly smaller than @xmath135 , where @xmath25 is the core radius . substituting this relation into equation ( [ vbambi ] ) , we find that @xmath87 and @xmath2 are independent of @xmath4 and equal to those at @xmath53 as shown by nakano ( 1998 ) .",
    "another limiting case is where the dominant charged particles are not at all frozen to magnetic fields , or @xmath136 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath137 @xmath138 electrical neutrality derives the last expression of equation ( [ a2nf ] ) .",
    "again we find @xmath139 .",
    "taking @xmath140 , we obtain the drift time of magnetic fields @xmath141 this is the well - known ohmic dissipation time , which does not depend on the field strength .",
    "thus our formalism contains ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation as limiting cases .",
    "we adopt the cloud model almost the same as @xcite . because magnetized clouds can contract along field lines rather easily",
    ", the force balance may approximately hold between gravity and gas pressure along field lines even when they are contracting dynamically perpendicular to field lines ( e.g. , @xcite ; nakamura , hanawa , & nakano 1995 ) . in such clouds",
    "the mean density @xmath121 and the mean column density @xmath122 along field lines have a relation @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the mean temperature of the cloud , @xmath144 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath145 is the mean molecular weight of the gas , and @xmath146 is the mass of a hydrogen atom . equation ( [ sigma ] ) gives the column density of an isothermal disk in equilibrium if @xmath121 is half the density at the midplane .",
    "if magnetic fields are weak and the isothermal ( spherical ) cloud is on the verge of collapse ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the mean column density is @xmath147 times that of equation ( [ sigma ] ) . the half - thickness of the cloud is given by @xmath148 , or @xmath149 both @xmath122 and @xmath150 are independent of the cloud mass .      as the reaction scheme of determining densities of various charged particles ,",
    "we adopt the same model as umebayashi & nakano ( 1990 ) and @xcite though we have revised some of the rate coefficients according to le teuff , millar , & markwick ( 2000 ) ; the greatest change is for dissociative recombination of h@xmath151 . in dense clouds sufficiently opaque to interstellar ultraviolet radiation , ions and free electrons are formed mainly by ionization of h@xmath127 molecules and he atoms by cosmic rays . after some reactions in the gas phase and at grain surface they finally recombine each other .",
    "we determine the densities of various charged particles assuming steady state for all the reactions .    as cosmic rays",
    "go deep into a cloud , their intensity decreases by interaction with matter , and the ionization rate decreases exponentially as @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the ionization rate of an h@xmath127 molecule at the cloud surface , @xmath154 is the depth in column density from the cloud surface , and @xmath155 is the attenuation length of the ionization rate ( @xcite ) . we take @xmath156 because we are interested in the mean densities of various particles in the cloud .",
    "we also take into account the ionization by radioactive elements contained in the cloud at a rate @xmath157 ( @xcite ) , which is important only at @xmath158 .    as charged particles we consider electrons e@xmath159 , atomic ions h@xmath160 ,",

    "we separate h@xmath151 from m@xmath160 because the large difference in their masses causes considerable differences in @xmath69 and @xmath163 .",
    "we adopt the mrn size distribution of grains given by @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the grain radius and @xmath166 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we take @xmath167 nm and @xmath168 nm . as for the charge states of grains we consider neutral , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the elementary electric charge .",
    "we divide the grain radius into 40 bins of equal logarithmic width @xmath173 .",
    "this must be accurate enough for our purpose because we have found little difference in numerical results compared with the case of 20 bins adopted by @xcite , though we have found some difference from the case of 5 bins adopted by desch & mouschovias ( 2001 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows abundances of various particles as functions of the cloud density @xmath9 for the _ standard _ case @xmath174 ( @xcite ) .",
    "ions and electrons are dominant charged particles at @xmath175 , ions and g@xmath159 ( grains of charge @xmath176 ) are dominant at @xmath9 between @xmath177 and @xmath178 , and g@xmath159 and g@xmath160 are major at @xmath179 . to keep electrical neutrality at very high densities @xmath179 where ions and electrons are no longer dominant charged particles because of their efficient recombination , @xmath180 must hold .",
    "nakano ( 1984 ) showed that to assure this relation the number flux of thermal electrons must be @xmath181 times that of thermal ions , or @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath184 are sticking probabilities of ions and electrons , respectively , when they collide neutral grains .",
    "although nakano ( 1984 ) ignored electric polarization of grains induced by approaching charged particles , which has an effect of enhancing the collision rate ( @xcite ) , this effect cancels out in the derivation of equation ( [ neni ] ) . as seen in figure 1 ,",

    "in the existence of an electric field @xmath84 a particle of electric charge @xmath304 gyrating around magnetic field lines are smaller than @xmath2 and @xmath45 by orders of magnitude .",

    "if there is a force field @xmath307 , which is independent of the particle charge , instead of the electric field , the particle drifts with a velocity @xmath308 dependent on its charge . in the frame moving with the neutrals in a molecular cloud , there is an electric field satisfying equation ( [ elecfield ] ) , which causes a charge - independent drift motion ( call this drift 1 ) .",
    "neutral molecules exert a frictional force on this drift motion , which is anti - parallel to the drift velocity independent of the electric charge .",
    "therefore , this force causes another drift motion ( drift 2 ) whose direction depends on the particle charge .",
    "thus the drift velocity has both components dependent on and independent of the particle charge .",
    "because drift 2 has opposite directions for particles of opposite charges , the frictional force on this motion yields the third drift motion whose direction is charge - independent , etc .",
    "all these can be taken into account in the equation for the steady motion ( [ meanmotion ] ) in appendix  [ anotherform ] .",
    "the direct solution of this equation is given by equations ( [ vlambdapara ] ) and ( [ vlambdaperp ] ) , whose components perpendicular to @xmath30 are found to agree with equations ( [ vlx ] ) and ( [ vly ] ) .",
    "when @xmath305 , the frictional force can be comparable to or stronger than the electric force , and therefore the charge - dependent part of the drift velocity can be comparable to or greater than the charge - independent one .",
    "because grains of opposite charges drift in opposite directions at high densities where grains are the major charged particles , one may anticipate that charge separation occurs in the @xmath261- , or @xmath63-direction . however , this is not the case .",
    "all charged particles should be taken into account . as confirmed in ",
    "[ formulae ] , equation ( [ vlx ] ) guarantees that the @xmath63-component of the electric current density vanishes .    although the frictional force is contributed mostly by grains at high densities , their drift velocities are very small . for example , at the decoupling density @xmath309 for @xmath53 with @xmath174 even the smallest grains of @xmath275 nm with electric charge @xmath176 have a drift velocity as small as @xmath310 as seen from figure 5 . because extensive magnetic flux loss occurs only at @xmath50 and decrease of @xmath33 by the flux loss makes @xmath245 even smaller ( figure 5 ) , grains are hardly lost from the cloud core even if the magnetic flux decreases by orders of magnitude as far as the cloud core is magnetically supercritical . although ciolek & mouschovias ( 1994 ) write that the grain abundance decreases almost in proportion to the reduction factor of the magnetic flux in highly magnetically subcritical cloud cores , cloud cores can hardly be magnetically subcritical as discussed by nakano ( 1998 ) .",
    "although the drift velocity of ions is not very small compared with that of magnetic fields even at @xmath13 for @xmath254 ( figure 4 ) , ions are quite minor constituents among the heavy elements even in the gas phase ( figure 1 ) . thus magnetic flux loss in cloud cores has little effect on the abundance of heavy elements in stars born therein .",
    "electric charges of grains change stochastically because ions and electrons sometimes stick to them .",
    "this change has some effect on their motion in electromagnetic fields .",
    "nakano ( 1984 ) and @xcite neglected this effect because they had a rough estimation that it was small ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "kamaya & nishi ( 2000 ) investigated this effect more elaborately for grains of charge @xmath176 .",
    "the probability of having some charge is proportional to the time span during which the grain has this charge .",
    "therefore , as seen from figure 2 , the grains of charge @xmath176 change their charge mostly by going to the neutral state at most radii @xmath165 and at most densities @xmath9 .",
    "the charge change between the @xmath176 and neutral states effectively decreases the viscous damping time @xmath311 of grains of charge @xmath176 by some factor @xmath312 .",
    "this effect can be taken into account by replacing @xmath311 with @xmath313 in our formalism summarized in  [ drift ] .",
    "kamaya & nishi found that if h@xmath151 is the dominant ion , @xmath314 for grains of @xmath248 nm is 1.3 at @xmath315 and approaches @xmath316 as @xmath9 increases , and that larger grains have @xmath314 closer to @xmath316 .",
    "because metallic ions and molecular ions other than h@xmath151 are the dominant ions as shown in figure 1 , deviations of @xmath314 from @xmath316 are about 3 times smaller than those obtained for h@xmath151 by kamaya & nishi ( 2000 ) at all densities and at all grain radii ; the deviation @xmath317 is proportional to @xmath318 , where @xmath126 is the mass of the dominant ions",
    ". therefore , charge fluctuation of grains can hardly affect @xmath2 because @xmath314 can be as large as 1.1 only for smallest grains only at low densities @xmath319 , where grains are minor contributors to the frictional force .",
    "thus , our formalism can be applied to any situation with little error though ciolek & mouschovias ( 1993 ) pointed out our ignorance of this effect .",
    "we compare our results with several previous works on @xmath2 , @xmath57 , and the dissipation in excess of ohmic dissipation given by @xmath207 in equation ( [ excess ] ) .",
    "the decoupling densities @xmath57 obtained in  [ losstime ] are about 4 times larger than that of @xcite for the same grain model .",
    "the main cause for this difference is in @xmath32 ; our @xmath32 is @xmath320 times larger than theirs . at relatively low densities where major charged particles are well frozen to magnetic fields , difference in the coefficient of @xmath32 has little effect on @xmath2 for a given @xmath33 because these particles drift almost with magnetic fields and the drift velocity @xmath87 is determined by the balance of the frictional force on them with @xmath321 times the gravity as seen from equations ( [ vbambi ] ) and ( [ magforce ] ) . at high densities , @xmath2 , and then @xmath57 , depend on the coefficient of @xmath32 because the delay in the drift of major charged particles , which are not well frozen , depends on the field strength as discussed in  [ bdependence ] .",
    "however , the general feature of @xmath2 ( rough dependences on @xmath9 and @xmath322 , existence of @xmath57 , etc . ) is hardly affected by this coefficient .",

    "another difference is in the electric conductivity @xmath281 . for the collision of electrons with the neutrals",

    "desch & mouschovias ( 2001 ) used an equation equivalent to ours ( [ e0 ] ) or ( [ e0a ] ) though neglecting the dominant terms of @xmath76 and @xmath77 as pointed out in  [ contgrain ] .",
    "in  [ drift ] and appendix  [ anotherform ] we have neglected frictional forces on charged particles except those exerted by the neutrals . except for electrons in some limited situations ,",
    "this is a good approximation .",
    "we discuss the effect of collision between electrons and other charged particles on the collision time @xmath375 of electrons , which appears in the electric conductivity @xmath329 in equation ( [ sigmapara ] ) .",
    "the @xmath376 deflection time of an electron of velocity @xmath377 by collision with ions of electric charge @xmath378 is given by @xmath379 where @xmath380 is a quantity determined by the cut - off of the impact parameter for the collision ( @xcite ) .",

    "thus , the electric conductivity @xmath281 is significantly affected by collision of electrons with ions only when @xmath386 , or at @xmath387 as seen from figure 1 . although charged grains also scatter electrons , their contribution does not affect this conclusion much because @xmath388 at @xmath387 , @xmath389/ n_{\\rm h } \\lesssim 1 \\times 10^{-10}$ ] at @xmath390 , and @xmath380 for electron - grain collision is not much different from that for electron - ion collision .",
    "similarly ions are scattered by charged grains .",
    "this effect is important compared with their collision with the neutrals only when @xmath389/ n_{\\rm h } \\gtrsim 2 \\times 10^{-9}$ ] , which is not realized as seen from figure 1 .",
    "collision of ions with electrons has negligible effect on the motion of ions unless @xmath391 .",
    "collision of charged grains with ions is also much less effective than their collision with the neutrals .",
    "although @xmath281 is greatly affected by the scattering of electrons by ions at @xmath392 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are hardly affected as can be confirmed in the following way .",
    "even if the effect of collision with ions is taken into account on @xmath375 at @xmath387 , we find @xmath393 as far as @xmath394 , which is satisfied at least in the density range covered by this paper .",
    "therefore , contribution of electrons to @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( or @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) is still much smaller than that of ions as can be confirmed from equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "our results are therefore not affected by the correction on @xmath375 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have used @xmath281 with the corrected @xmath375 in the estimation of the ohmic dissipation time @xmath395 at @xmath396 in  1 ; without this correction , @xmath203 at this density will be @xmath52 times larger .",
    "ambipolar diffusion is a term originally used in plasma physics . at length scales larger than the debye shielding length in plasmas ,",
    "electrical neutrality is well established . therefore ,",
    "if there is a gradient in the electron density , they are transported with a flux proportional to their density gradient , and ions follow them because of electric forces , and vice versa .",
    "thus , particles of both electric charges diffuse as one unit .",
    "this process is called ambipolar diffusion ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whose literal meaning fits the process .    in the drift of magnetic fields in molecular clouds investigated first by mestel & spitzer ( 1956 ) ,",
    "ions and electrons , which are well frozen to magnetic fields , drift with the same velocity as if they were one unit . because of this seeming similarity this process got the name ",
    "ambipolar diffusion `` .",
    "however , the drift is driven by the magnetic force , not by the density gradient .",
    "thus , this process is quite different from what the physical term ' ' diffusion \" means .    in the original ambipolar diffusion",
    "the diffusion coefficient perpendicular to magnetic field lines is inversely proportional to both @xmath198 and the collision time of electrons with neutrals , @xmath375 , when @xmath351 ( @xcite ) , and thus the diffusion time is proportional to @xmath397 . on the other hand ,",
    "the drift time of magnetic fields given by equation ( [ tbambi ] ) in the same situation @xmath351 , @xmath398 , has the opposite dependences .",
    "this difference also shows that these processes are quite different from each other .",
    "in this paper we have found that grains , the main contributors to the frictional force , of opposite charges drift in opposite directions except at relatively low densities .",
    "this is even contrary to the literal meaning of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "some appropriate term is desired ; plasma drift is much better than ambipolar diffusion .",
