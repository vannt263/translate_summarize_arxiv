    "the most important advances in superconductivity research over the past two decades have been the discoveries and studies of superconductors in which strong electronic correlations play crucial roles in both the normal and superconducting ( sc ) states .",
    "thus , the so - called  unconventional \" superconductivity , realized in high-@xmath1 cuprates , organics , heavy - fermion intermetallic compounds , ruthenate,@xcite etc . , has become one of the most actively studied topics of modern - day condensed matter physics . since the anisotropic structure of the sc gap",
    "is directly connected with the sc order parameter and is closely related to the anisotropy of the pairing interaction , experimental determination of the gap structure is essential for the identification of the mechanism of superconductivity , especially among the unconventional superconductors .",
    "the field - orientation dependent specific heat , which is a direct measure of the quasiparticle density of states , is a powerful probe of the sc gap structure.@xcite    such an experiment requires : ( 1 ) reaching a very low temperature compared with the sc transition temperature @xmath1 , ( 2 ) high angular resolution of exact field alignment with respect to crystallographic axes , and ( 3 ) high - resolution calorimetry in magnetic fields . to satisfy condition ( 1 ) , we utilized a commercial dilution refrigerator .",
    "unconventional superconductors often have low - dimensional electronic structures and exhibit strong anisotropy in the upper critical field @xmath2  ( ref .  ) .",
    "thus the angular resolution of better than @xmath3 is often required for the measurements . to control the field direction ,",
    "the rotation of a sample with a geared goniometer has been widely used .",
    "a single - axis goniometer,@xcite a low friction single - axis goniometer,@xcite and a double - axis goniometer@xcite have been used . as a single - axis goniometer with a very compact and simple structure ,",
    "a piezoelectrically driven goniometer is also in use.@xcite for rotation in liquid - helium mixtures , a miniature rotatable vacuum cell has been developed.@xcite however , many of the geared goniometers can not avoid the heat generated by mechanical friction and suffer from poor angular reproducibility caused by the backlash of the gears . to achieve the condition",
    "( 2 ) and solve these problems , we developed a new system in which we electrically rotate the magnetic field with a  vector magnet \" and mechanically rotate this sc magnet with a one - circle goniometer against a fixed dilution refrigerator .",

    "the goniometer can rotate the two sc magnets and the dewar with the magnetic field applied either in a persistent - current mode or in a current feeding mode .",
