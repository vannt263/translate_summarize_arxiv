    "the viscoelasticity of solids has been the object of intense debate at least since the time of maxwell .",
    "continuum mechanics and relaxation models have flourished through all the last century , with many extensions proposed to capture different behaviours observed in metallurgy  @xcite . for crystals with line defects , andrade creep ( whereby the relaxation shear modulus presents the power - law scaling @xmath1 ) has been convincingly explained by nabarro , mott and others in terms of dislocation dynamics  @xcite .",
    "internal friction , which represents the imaginary part of the viscoelastic response also known as the loss modulus @xmath2 , has been interpreted in earlier models , in terms of diffusive motion of atoms associated with defect mobility .    in glasses",
    "the situation is more complicated , because dislocations are difficult to identify , and the origin of internal friction and complex relaxation behaviour observed typically ( power - law or stretched - exponential ) has remained unexplained .",
    "a recent work  @xcite has applied elegant field - theoretic methods within coherent - potential approximation , starting from the assumption of spatially heterogeneous static shear modulus , to successfully recover the @xmath3-wing asymmetry in the resonance peak of @xmath2 in oscillatory rheology observed in experiments . however , the theory is on the continuum level , and does not clarify which microscopic ( atomic - level ) features ultimately control the viscoelastic response .",
    "recent simulation work  @xcite motivated by this problem in the context of metallic glasses , has shown that internal friction in glasses may have its origin in quasi - localized correlated motions that have an avalanche - like character .",
    "furthermore , these excitations were found to be suppressed in regions of high icosahedral symmetry .",
    "power - law creep @xmath4 was recovered in previous work using mean field theory  @xcite and average stress fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the same result was found in a related field of athermal jammed solids , where simulations and scaling arguments  @xcite based on kelvin - voigt viscoelasticity have been combined with asymptotics of the vibrational density of states ( dos ) near the jamming transition ( at which a jammed solid loses rigidity ) with average contact number @xmath5 , although the strongly non - affine motion of the particles , which is crucial for disordered and jammed solids  @xcite , was not explicitly taken into account in the scaling analysis  @xcite .",
    "we improve on these methods by taking into account the exact microstructure of the system as well as the non - affine motions of all particles , providing a direct link between the microscopic landscape and the frequency and time dependent shear modulus .",
    "here we re - examine this problem by considering three very different model systems of amorphous solids in 3d , of which 2d slices are given in fig.1 .",
    "we will work with a specific model of disordered harmonic spring networks formed from the low-@xmath6 equilibration of dense lennard - jones fluids .",
    "this is a good model for atomic disordered solids ( defective crystals , metallic glasses ) but different from other types of disordered networks where the preparation protocol may change the critical exponents and the critical coordination numbers  @xcite .",
    "+ the first lattice is a random network of harmonic springs generated according to the protocol in ref .",
    "@xcite : a lennard - jones glass is formed and equilibrated in a metastable minimum , after which all nearest - neighbour interactions are replaced by harmonic springs , all with the same spring constant @xmath7 and with a relatively narrow distribution of spring length @xmath8 . upon randomly cutting the harmonic bonds in the sample , lattices with variable coordination number @xmath9 can be formed . in the present work",
    "this depletion process is performed in such a way that we get a very narrow distribution of coordination numbers to avoid effects stemming from fluctuating connectivity in the system .",
    "+ the two fcc lattices ( the bond - depleted , fig.1b , and with vacancies , fig.1c ) are instead generated starting from a perfect fcc lattice with @xmath10 and same spring constant @xmath7 and lattice constant @xmath8 as the random lattice .",
    "the microstructure , and in particular the local symmetry , of the three lattices is , however , very different .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the standard bond - orientational order parameter @xmath11 , which measures the spread in the orientations of bonds on the lattice  @xcite , is practically equal to @xmath12 for the bond - depleted fcc ( for any @xmath9 value ) , whereas it is much lower ( @xmath13 ) for the random lattice .",
    "+ for these models we develop an analytical theory of viscoelastic response based on the non - affine deformation formalism , which is a fully microscopic approach .",
    "our analysis shows that , surprisingly , the oscillatory moduli of these systems fall onto a master curve after normalizing by an order parameter which describes the average degree of local inversion - symmetry on any atom .",
    "the same order parameter controls the non - affine particle rearrangements that have a cooperative quasi - localized character , which explains the findings of simulations  @xcite .",
    "further , the power - law creep @xmath4 found near the isostatic transition of all the three lattices is shown to be the consequence of both the excess of soft modes in the dos , and crucially , also of the underlying non - affine dynamics .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the microscopic equation of motion for a particle in a disordered lattice , which was derived for the case of a phenomenological damping motion with constant damping coefficient @xmath14 , in ref .",
    "@xcite and was shown , also in  @xcite , to reduce to a simple harmonic - oscillator type equation for the deviation variable @xmath15 which measures the particle displacement from the original position : @xmath16 we used the hessian of the system @xmath17 and the non - affine force @xmath18 . here , @xmath19 denotes the cauchy strain tensor for a generic deformation field . for a shear deformation , @xmath20 .",
    "the non - affine force @xmath21 represents the net force that acts on a particle that is en route towards its affine position .",
    "if the particle s original position in the undeformed lattice is @xmath22 , the affine position is defined as @xmath23 . in a perfectly centrosymmetric lattice ,",
    "the particle en route towards this affine position receives forces from its nearest - neighbours which cancel each other out by symmetry , leaving the particle at equilibrium in the affine position . in a disordered lattice , due to local breaking of inversion - symmetry on the given particle , these forces",
    "do not cancel , and their vector sum is a net force that brings the particle to a final ( non - affine ) position which differs from @xmath24 . for a generic harmonic lattice with no pre - stress ,",
    "the non - affine force vector is defined as @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath7 being the rest distance and force constant between the particles .",
    "the sum is performed over the nearest neighbours and includes the unit bond vector @xmath27 pointing from atom @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "normal - mode decomposition of the terms in eq.(1 ) onto the eigenvectors @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 ) of the hessian , and taking the fourier transform of the equation of motion as in ref.@xcite , lead to the complex viscoelastic shear modulus for oscillatory shear deformation ( with imposed frequency @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 here we introduced the frequency correlator of the non - affine forces , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . also , @xmath36 is the atomic density , or number of atoms ( or nodes ) on the lattice per unit volume .",
    "@xmath37 is the affine shear modulus ( also known as the born - huang modulus ) , which is independent of the applied frequency @xmath32 , and coincides with the elastic response in the limit @xmath38 . here",
    ", @xmath39 denotes the eigenmode frequency of internal vibrations of the lattice , and @xmath40 denotes the debye frequency , i.e. the highest frequency of the vibrational spectrum .",
    "the latter spectrum , i.e. the normalized distribution of vibrational eigenmodes is represented by the dos , denoted here as @xmath41 .",
    "the mass of the particles @xmath42 is set to @xmath12 for the reminder of the paper , since it s of no concern in the present work .",
    "+ the above sum - rule allows the calculation of the complex shear modulus for any harmonic lattice for which both the dos and the correlator function @xmath43 can be easily evaluated numerically . for the dos we follow the same procedure as in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas for @xmath43 we follow the procedure of ref .",
    "this is a straightforward exercise for the three model lattices shown in fig.1 .",
    "we have calculated @xmath44 for the three lattices with two different average coordination numbers @xmath45 : @xmath46 , where all lattices are mechanically well stable ; @xmath47 ( for the fcc with vacancies ) and @xmath48 ( for the two bond - depleted systems ) , i.e. very close to the point of marginal stability .",
    "first we calculated the vibrational density of states @xmath41 and the correlator function @xmath43 , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dosgamma ] . since these quantities appear as the @xmath49 product in eq.(2 ) , it is convenient to study this product as a single function of @xmath39 .",
    "remarkably , we notice from fig .",
    "[ fig : dosgamma ] that , although @xmath41 and @xmath43 behave differently for each of the three systems and have a rather complicated form , their product , when normalized by the quantity @xmath50 , shows a strikingly _ universal _ behaviour over the full frequency range , and can be fitted by a simple cubic function of @xmath39 , of the form @xmath51 here , the quantity @xmath52 is evaluated by taking the square of the absolute value of each vector @xmath53 , constructed for each atom @xmath28 , and averaging over all atoms in the system . this same quantity has been used to form a suitably normalized order parameter in  @xcite .",
    "( a , b ) and correlator function @xmath43 ( c , d ) for the three different model systems and two different coordination numbers ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively ) .",
    "they are normalized by @xmath50 , proportional to the average absolute square of the non - affine force field to obtain a master curve .",
    "( e , f ) show the product @xmath56 which appears in the formula for @xmath44 . remarkably , the product of the two functions can be conveniently fitted by a simple cubic function @xmath57 , represented as a solid line.,width=321,height=298 ]    since @xmath41 approaches a low-@xmath39 plateau in the limit of marginal stability ( @xmath58 ) , as is known from many studies in the past  @xcite ) , the low frequency behaviour of @xmath56 is dominated by the correlator function @xmath59 , a result that was derived in ref .",
    "it is interesting to note dirac - delta spikes in @xmath43 , which happen at frequencies that correspond to strongly - localized modes : at @xmath5 a spike is visible near the top of the spectrum , where modes tend to be anderson - localized . at @xmath55 , instead ,",
    "a spike is visible at a frequency close to the ioffe - regel crossover  @xcite ( and to the boson peak frequency ) where modes are also strongly localized  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the viscoelastic response of the three models systems .",
    "we use the convention of splitting the complex shear modulus into its real and imaginary part @xmath60 .",
    "both moduli can be calculated according to @xmath61 and are plotted in fig.3 . in the numerical calculation we implemented the convenient cubic form of the product @xmath49 that was shown above to be an excellent fitting to the numerical evaluation of these functions .",
    "various scalings have been reported in the plots , which can be extracted from the asymptotic analysis of eq.(4)-(5 ) .",
    "most notable of which are the low frequency scalings scalings of @xmath62 , which agree very well with emt results from ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 ) .",
    "deviations from their numerical results ( @xmath67 ) might be caused by finite temperature effects in their simulations ( whereas our calculation is carried out at @xmath68 ) . in our work",
    "we have used different values of the damping coefficient @xmath14 to study its influence on the results . we found that it has no influence on the qualitative behaviour of @xmath69 and @xmath2 , besides when it approaches very small values , where we get divergent results . aside from that @xmath14 only shifts the values to smaller @xmath32 and expands the range of the @xmath70 scaling in @xmath2 .",
    "we therefore chose a quite large value @xmath71 to demonstrate this behaviour clearly and to focus on the physically important case of overdamped dynamics typical of amorphous solids ( metallic glasses , organic glasses , foams etc ) .",
    "next we consider the time - dependent shear modulus @xmath72 , which can be calculated by taking the inverse fourier transform of @xmath44 , @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the quasistatic ( infinite - time or zero - frequency ) shear modulus ( which has a strong nonaffine character ) , @xmath75 denotes the cardinal sine function .",
    "numerical evaluation of eq.(6 ) for the three lattices at the two representative values of @xmath9 are reported in fig.4 .",
    "again we took advantage of the simple cubic fitting eq.(3 ) for the product @xmath49 , which allows one to avoid the problem of a numerical gap between zero frequency and the first eigenfrequency ( this gap is not negligible for systems with @xmath76 and our simulated lattices have @xmath77 ) . for small times",
    "we observe a plateau that corresponds to the high - frequency affine response , after which a power - law decay is observed with an exponent comprised in the range between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this power - law can be understood mechanistically as follows .",
    "we focus on the limit overdamped systems , which is both important and turns to be amenable to analytic simplifications . for large @xmath14 and large times we can simplify the expression in eq.(6 ) .",
    "first we take @xmath80 , where we use @xmath81 .",
    "we insert this into eq.(6 ) and use the definition of @xmath82 to get @xmath83 in the last step we have used @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this corresponds to a system of maxwell elements with relaxation times @xmath86 .",
    "we now recall the standard relationship between the dos and the eigenvalue spectrum @xmath87 of the hessian matrix , @xmath88 , with @xmath89 . at the isostatic point of disordered solids ,",
    "@xmath5 the dos develops a plateau of soft modes , which is visible in our fig.2(a ) .",
    "this limit corresponds to the scaling @xmath90 in the eigenvalue distribution , which arises from the dominance of random - matrix behaviour in the spectrum , and this scaling can be derived e.g. from the famous marcenko - pastur distribution of random - matrix theory , as discussed recently in  @xcite . in our dos , a scaling @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a constant , is more appropriate",
    "since we are in fact slightly above @xmath5 , and this will explain the power - law exponents in @xmath72 larger than @xmath93 in our calculations . however , we will stick to the simple @xmath94 for the asymptotic analysis .",
    "recall now that @xmath95 , from the analytical theory of non - affine deformations  @xcite , which implies @xmath96 . inserting these results in the last line of eq.(7 )",
    "we obtain the following laplace transform which can be easily evaluated to : @xmath97    this scaling for the power - law creep modulus was shown in simulations of creep in athermal jammed systems in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a system of kelvin - voigt elements ( whereas we use a standard - linear - solid or zener material ) .",
    "the theoretical argument that was proposed to explain the scaling @xmath98 was not fully microscopic , because the correlator between eigenmodes and shear field was taken to be independent of the eigenfrequency , hence constant on average for a given frequency interval .",
    "this is not a physically justified approximation , because the correlator @xmath43 in our data ( and also in ref.@xcite ) displays a strong ( and non - random ) dependence on the eigenfrequency as one can see in fig . 2 ( c , d ) .",
    "our model improves substantially on this aspect , by including the eigenfrequency dependence of the non - affine correlator into the theoretical analysis of the scaling . in this way",
    ", our framework provides a direct link between the microscopic nonaffine dynamics and the viscoelastic moduli .",
    "using the non - affine response formalism , we studied three model harmonic lattices with disorder , which have very different microstructure ( as reflected in e.g. different values of bond - orientational order parameter as shown in previous work  @xcite ) . yet",
    ", the three different lattices have qualitatively the same ( universal ) viscoelastic response , i.e. @xmath69 and @xmath2 collapse onto master curves as a function of frequency , once the moduli are normalized by a factor @xmath50 , where @xmath99 is the atomic density . here",
    "@xmath100 is crucially related to the symmetry that controls this universality : the local degree of inversion - symmetry .",
    "this is evident from the definition of the non - affine force vector for harmonic lattices : @xmath101 .",
    "the norm of this vector is clearly identically zero for all atoms in a perfectly centrosymmetric lattice with no defects , whereas its value is larger for lattices where the inversion - symmetry is lowered .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath102 crucially is proportional to the overall ( spatially - averaged ) degree to which local inversion symmetry is broken in a disordered lattice .",
    "these results thus identify the atomic - scale origin of internal friction and viscoelastic response in amorphous solids ( e.g. glasses ) with the local inversion - symmetry breaking , which is the same effect that causes a softer elastic response  @xcite and is associated with quasi - localized avalanche - like non - affine motions  @xcite .",
    "our framework provides a clear theoretical explanation to recent simulations results  @xcite where internal friction was shown to correlate with cooperative non - affine motions and regions of lower local symmetry",
    ". this framework will play an important role for the rational design of new materials with tailored viscoelastic response and energy absorption properties in many materials science and engineering applications ."
