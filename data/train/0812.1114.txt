    "the standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak interactions is the present paradigm of particle physics .",
    "its validity has been tested to a level better than one per mille at particle accelerators  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are arguments against the sm being the fundamental model of particle interactions  @xcite , giving rise to the investigation of competing alternative or extended models , which can be tested at high - energy colliders , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc )  , or a @xmath0 , @xmath1 international linear collider ( ilc )  .",
    "one of the most promising possibilities for physics beyond the sm is the incorporation of supersymmetry ( susy ) , which leads to a renormalizable field theory with precisely calculable predictions to be tested in present and future experiments .",
    "the simplest supersymmetric extension of the sm is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  . among the most important phenomenological consequences of susy models ,",
    "is the prediction of new particles .",
    "there is much excitement for the possibility of discovering these new particles at the recently built lhc  @xcite , and their properties will need to be precisely measured to confirm ( or refute ) that they belong to a susy model .",
    "this last effort might be better suited for the ilc  , currently being projected .",
    "this job needs the performance of precision measurements , but also of precision computations which are well suited for experimental comparisons . in the present work",
    "we will focus on the properties of the susy partners of the sm quarks  the squarks .",
    "once produced , squarks will decay in a way dependent on the model parameters ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "if gluinos ( the fermionic susy partners of gluons ) are light enough , squarks will mainly decay into gluinos and quarks ( @xmath2 )  @xcite , which proceeds trough a coupling constant of strong strength .",
    "if the mass difference among different squarks is large enough , some squarks can decay via a bosonic channel into an electroweak gauge boson and another squark ( @xmath3 ) , and if higgs bosons are light enough , also the scalar decay channels are available ( @xmath4 )  @xcite , which can be dominant for third generation squarks due to the large yukawa couplings .",
    "otherwise , the main decay channels of squarks are their partial decays into charginos / neutralinos ( the fermionic susy partners of the electroweak gauge and higgs bosons ) and quarks ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "some of those channels are expected to be always open , given the large mass difference between quarks and squarks , and that the charginos / neutralinos are expected to be lighter than most of squarks in the majority of susy - breaking models .",
    "in the few cases in which these channels are closed , the squarks will decay through flavour changing neutral channels  @xcite , or through three- or four - body decay channels involving a non - resonant susy particle  @xcite .    here",
    "we will concentrate on the squark decay channels involving charginos and neutralinos .",
    "their partial decay widths were computed some time ago , including the radiative corrections due to the strong ( qcd )  @xcite , and the electroweak ( ew)@xcite sectors of the theory .",
    "these radiative corrections are large in certain regions of the parameter space@xcite , and their complicated expressions are not suitable for their introduction in the monte - carlo programs used for experimental analyses . in this work we present approximations for the partial decay widths of squarks into charginos and neutralinos , including the qcd corrections , and compare these approximations against the fixed - order one - loop corrected partial widths .    in section  [ sec :",
    "notation ] we introduce our notation and conventions for particles and couplings , and set up the numerical values that we will use in our analysis , section  [ sec : qcd - corrections ] presents the qcd one - loop computation of the partial decay widths and shows some numerical examples , in section  [ sec : rge ] we perform a renormalization group analysis of the partial decay widths , in section  [ sec : numerical ] we perform a numerical comparison of the one - loop and renormalization group computations , and finally section  [ sec : conclusions ] shows our conclusions .",
    "to describe the computation of the partial decay widths , we will follow the conventions of ref .  @xcite . throughout this work",
    "we will use a third - generation notation to describe quarks and squarks , but the analytic results and conclusions are completely general , and can be used for quarks - squarks of any generation .",
    "we will show numerical results only for third generation quarks / squarks ( top @xmath6/stop @xmath7/bottom @xmath8/sbottom @xmath9 ) , since their decay widths are the ones that present the most interesting properties .",
    "we will study the partial decay widths of sfermions into fermions and charginos / neutralinos , @xmath10    we denote the two sfermion - mass eigenvalues by @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "the sfermion - mixing angle @xmath13 is defined by the transformation relating the weak - interaction ( @xmath14 ) and the mass eigenstate ( @xmath15 ) sfermion bases : @xmath16 by this basis transformation , the sfermion mass matrix , @xmath17 becomes diagonal : @xmath18 .",

    "the mixing parameters in the non - diagonal entries read @xmath28 @xmath29 are the trilinear soft - susy - breaking couplings , @xmath30 is the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath31 is the ratio between the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets @xmath32 .",
    "the input parameters in the sfermion sector are then : @xmath33 for each sfermion doublet . from them",
    ", we can derive the masses and mixing angles : @xmath34 for the trilinear couplings , we require the approximate ( necessary ) condition @xmath35 where @xmath36 is of the order of the average squark masses for @xmath37 , to avoid colour - breaking minima in the mssm higgs potential .",
    "although the tree - level chargino ( @xmath38)-neutralino ( @xmath39 ) sector is well known , we give here a short description , in order to set our conventions .",
    "we start by constructing the following set of weyl spinors : @xmath40 the mass lagrangian in this basis reads @xmath41 where we have defined @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 the @xmath20 and @xmath45 soft - susy - breaking gaugino masses .",
    "the four - component mass - eigenstate fields are related to the ones in  ( [ eq : inosweak ] ) by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are in general complex matrices that diagonalize the mass - matrices  ( [ eq : massacplusneut ] ) : @xmath50    using this notation , the tree - level interaction lagrangian between fermion - sfermion-(chargino or neutralino ) reads  @xcite @xmath51 here we have adopted a compact notation , where @xmath52 is either @xmath53 or its @xmath20 partner for @xmath54 being a neutralino or a chargino , respectively .",
    "roman characters @xmath55 are reserved for sfermion indices and @xmath56 for chargino indices ; greek indices @xmath57 denote neutralinos ; roman indices @xmath58 indicate either a chargino or a neutralino .",
    "for example , the top - squark interactions with charginos are obtained by replacing @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the coupling matrices that encode the dynamics are given by @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 the weak hypercharges of the left - handed @xmath20 doublet and right - handed singlet fermion , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the yukawa couplings normalized to the @xmath20 gauge coupling constant @xmath68 .",
    "note the following , each coupling is formed by two parts : the gaugino part , formed exclusively by gauge couplings , and the higgsino part , which contains factors of the quark masses , each of these parts will receive different kinds of corrections ( see below ) .    using these definitions ,",

    "we will use fixed values for the susy parameters , and make plots by changing one parameter at a time .",
    "for the central values of the parameters we take : @xmath71 where we have introduced a parameter @xmath72 as a shortcut for all the susy mass parameters which are not explicitly given .",
    "we use the gut relation @xmath73 for the bino mass parameter . for the sm parameters we use @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath23 is taken to be the physical mass of the decaying squark .",
    "the value of the trilinear couplings @xmath29 is given by the algebraic expression , the given numerical value corresponds to the default values of the other parameters , this numerical value will change in the plots , the chosen expression allows to show plots with a significant parameter variation avoiding colour - breaking - vacuum conditions  ( [ eq : necessary ] ) . with these input parameters , the central values for the physical susy",
    "particle masses are : @xmath80 it is illustrative to identify the largest ew - basis component in each physical state .",
    "of course , we have performed our computation using the full numerical mixing among the ew - basis and the physical - basis components , but this identification will help us to analyze the numerical results . the lightest squarks ( @xmath81 ) are predominantly left - handed , the lightest chargino and neutralinos ( @xmath82 ) are predominantly gaugino - like , whereas the heaviest ones ( @xmath83 ) are predominantly higgsino - like . of course ,",
    "the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : susyparams ] ) are just and example for illustrative purposes , we have checked that our conclusions hold for a wide range of the parameter space .",
    "following this setup , we have computed the full one - loop qcd corrections to the squark partial decay widths into charginos and neutralinos  ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) .",
    "the renormalization prescriptions follow that of ref.@xcite .",
    "the qcd corrections include contributions from gluon loops , gluino loops , and gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the full one - loop corrections have been performed using the feynarts / formcalc / looptools packages  .",
    "we have used dimensional reduction for the regularization of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences , and a small gluon mass to regularize the infrared ( ir ) divergences .",
    "the three - body phase - space integration of the real gluon emission is performed analytically over the full energy range , and the dependence on the gluon mass is seen to cancel between the virtual and the real corrections .",
    "we have found full agreement with previous works  , and will not repeat the full lengthy formulae here .",
    "the corrections are seen to be numerically large , specially in certain regions of the parameter space  @xcite , specially those involving processes with a bottom - squark in the initial state , and in a regime of large @xmath31 values .",
    "we follow the hints from higgs - boson physics  @xcite , and define effective yukawa couplings which should encode the leading part of the corrections@xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the running quark mass and @xmath86 is the finite threshold correction .",
    "the susy - qcd contributions to @xmath86 are : @xmath87 where the function @xmath88 is the scalar three - point function at zero momentum transfer , and reads : @xmath89 the effective description of squark decays consists in replacing the tree - level quark masses in the couplings  ( [ v1apm ] ) by the effective yukawa couplings of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) , and use this lagrangian to compute the partial decay width , schematically : @xmath90 this expression contains the large one - loop corrections from the finite threshold corrections  ( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) , but it also contains higher order corrections . at this point",
    "we can make the following : make a computation that combines the higher order effects ( which ignore the effects of external momenta ) and the fixed one - loop ( which ignore the higher order effects ) . at the same time , this will allow us to quantify the degree of accuracy obtained by the effective description .",
    "we define a _",
    "yukawa - improved decay width computation _ : @xmath91 where @xmath92 here @xmath93 is the one - loop fixed order prediction for the partial decay width , @xmath94 is the one - loop expansion of the prediction using effective couplings , and therefore , the _ remainder _ contribution ( @xmath95 ) is the part of the one - loop contribution that can not be described by the yukawa effective couplings , it quantifies the approximation done by the effective description .",

    "finally , we define a _",
    "yukawa - improved _ correction factor in the following way : @xmath101    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     finally fig .",
    "[ fig : msq ] shows the evolution of the corrections to the partial decay widths as a function of the @xmath20 squark mass parameter @xmath102 .",
    "the abrupt change which is seen at the middle of the plots corresponds with the situation in which @xmath103 , and the physical states suffer an abrupt change between left and right chirality .",
    "this explains the difference in value and behaviour of the corrections in the regions of @xmath102 below and above that point .",
    "this is also the situation , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stopdeccormsq1 ] , where the partial decay widths can become zero , and the one - loop corrections can become non - perturbative . in all situations",
    "the description including the log - terms provides a better description of the radiative corrections with a @xmath104  ( [ eq : defremainder ] ) much smaller than with the effective yukawa couplings  ( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) alone , and a much softer variation , meaning that the description of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logterms ] ) is accurate for all values of the squark mass .",
    "let us remember , that by changing the susy parameter @xmath102 , the physical squark masses also change , and that since the renormalization scale is taken to be the decaying squark mass , the log - terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logterms ] ) effectively run also with @xmath102 as @xmath105 ( for mostly - left - handed squarks )  a contribution that can not be described with the effective yukawa couplings  ( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) .",
    "we have proposed and analyzed an effective description of squark interactions with charginos and neutralinos in the mssm .",
    "we have applied it to the partial decay widths of squarks into charginos and neutralinos .",
    "we have compared it with the full one - loop corrections , and have proposed a way to combine the effective description ( which includes higher order terms ) with the complete one - loop description ( which includes all kinetic and mass - effects factors ) , providing an _ improved _ computation , @xmath106 ( [ improved ] ) . the difference between the effective description and the _",
    "improved _ computation is encoded in the _ remainder _ contribution , @xmath104 eq .  ( [ eq : defremainder ] ) , which gives a measure of the precision of the effective description .",
    "the effective description includes the effective yukawa couplings  ( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) , which take into account the resummation effects  @xcite .",
    "note that the computation of the threshold corrections  ( [ eq : deltamq ] ) includes only the ( @xmath31 , @xmath107 ) proportional terms , since the terms that would be proportional to the trilinear couplings ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) are actually subleading  @xcite .",
    "this description produces large _ remainder _ @xmath95 corrections , and does not reproduce the behaviour of the one - loop corrections as a function of several parameters  notably it is missing a @xmath110 term .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it does not reproduce satisfactorily the one - loop corrections , and it is not a good approximation .    we have computed the missing @xmath110 terms with the help of the renormalization group  eq .",
    "( [ eq : logterms ] )  , and found agreement between the renormalization group analysis and the large mass expansion of the one - loop result ( [ eq : logterm1loop ] ) . after including also the @xmath110-terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logterms ] ) , the effective description produces a reasonable approximation to the radiative - corrected partial decay widths of squarks into charginos and neutralinos , as shown by a small absolute value of the _ remainder _ contributions @xmath104 , and by a nearly - flat behaviour of the corrections as a function of different parameters .",
    "the origin of the logarithmic terms can be explained in different ( complementary ) ways , depending on the kind of approximation that we take .",
    "first of all , from the fundamental point of view , they are _ non - decoupling _ terms that appear due to the supersymmetry - breaking .",
    "since we are testing susy relations ( equality of the gauge / yukawa couplings to the gaugino / higgsino couplings ) , and susy is broken ( by the term @xmath111 among others ) , we have to find some effect that tells us about the breaking of susy at that scale ",
    "e.g. a @xmath110-term .",
    "second , from a fixed - order one - loop description point of view , the susy relation appears because the uv - divergences of the loops containing gluinos cancel with the uv - divergences of the loops containing gluons , and the log - terms that accompany those loops combine between them  producing a @xmath110-term . and",
    "third , from a renormalization group ( and effective theory ) point of view , the gaugino / higgsino couplings run different than the gauge / yukawa couplings in the region where susy is broken , that is , for scales below @xmath111 .",
    "the running of the gaugino / higgsino couplings from the scale @xmath111 to the chosen renormalization scale produces @xmath112-terms .",
    "since the yukawa couplings already include some qcd running , whereas the ew - gauge couplings do not , the relation between the gauge / gaugino and yukawa / higgsino couplings has some differences  ( [ eq : logterms ] ) .",
    "the presence of the non - decoupling @xmath110-terms implies a deviation of the equality between the higgsino / gaugino and higgs / gauge couplings predicted by exact susy .",
    "this deviation is important , and has to be taken into account in the experimental measurement of susy relations . at the same time",
    ", it gives us access to information about heavy particles that can not be directly produced at the lhc / ilc . for these reasons it is important to include these effects in the computation for the predictions of squark observables at the lhc and the ilc .",
    "the effective description of squark / chargino / neutralino couplings given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) , ( [ eq : deltamq ] ) , ( [ eq : logterms ] ) , is simple to write , and to introduce in computer codes , it costs little computational power , and provides a reasonable description for squark decays into charginos and neutralinos , so it can be used in monte - carlo generators and other computer programs that provide predictions for the lhc and the ilc to improve their accuracy at a minimum cost .",
