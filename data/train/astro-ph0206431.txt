    "one of the most important astrophysical phenomena still lacking an explanation is the origin of the celestial gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "these are powerful flashes of gamma - rays lasting from less than one second to tens of seconds , with isotropic distribution in the sky .",
    "they are observed above the terrestrial atmosphere with x gamma  ray detectors aboard satellites @xcite .",
    "thanks to the bepposax satellite @xcite , afterglow emission at lower wavelengths has been discovered @xcite and we now know that at least long ( @xmath17s ) grb s are at cosmological distances , with measured red shifts up to 4.5 ( see , e.g. , review by djorgovski @xcite and references therein ) . among the possible explanations of these events , which involve huge energy releases ( up to @xmath18 erg , assuming isotropic emission ) , the most likely candidates are the collapse of a very massive star ( hypernova ) and the coalescence of one compact binary system ( see , e.g. , reviews by piran @xcite and mszros @xcite and references therein ) . in both cases emission of gravitational waves ( gw ) is expected to be associated with them ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . according to several models , the duration of a gw burst is predicted to be of the order of a few milliseconds for a variety of sources , including the coalescing and merging black holes and/or neutron star binaries .",
    "therefore gw bursts can be detected by the present resonant detectors , designed to detect gw through the excitation of the quadrupole modes of massive cylinders , resonating at frequencies near 1 khz .    at the distances of the grb sources ( @xmath19 gpc ) ,",
    "the gw burst associated with a total conversion of 1 - 2 solar masses should have amplitude of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "the present sensitivity for 1 ms gw pulses of the best gw antennas with signal to noise ratio ( snr ) equal to unity is @xmath21 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which requires a total conversion of one million solar masses at 1 gpc . however , although detection of a gravitational signal associated with a single grb appears hopeless , detection of a signal associated with the sum of many events could be more realistic .",
    "thus we launched a program devoted to studying the presence of correlations between grb events detected with bepposax and the output signals from gravitational antennas nautilus and explorer .",
    "searching for correlation between grb and gw signals means dealing with the difference between the emission times for the two types of phenomena .",
    "furthermore , there is also the fact to consider that the time difference can vary from burst to burst . in the present analysis we use an algorithm based on cross - correlating the outputs of two gw detectors ( see @xcite ) , thus coping with the problem of the unknown possible time difference between grb and gw bursts , and also of the unmodelled noise .",
    "the rome group operates two resonant bar detectors : explorer @xcite , since 1990 , at the cern laboratories , and nautilus @xcite , since 1995 , at the infn laboratories in frascati .    0.1 in    .",
    "main characteristics of the two detectors .",

    "having presented the experimental method and the model for the averaged correlation at zero delay time @xmath24 , we can infer the values of gw amplitude @xmath25 consistent with the observation .",
    "we note that , using eqs .",
    "[ uppere ] and [ snrc1 ] , energy @xmath26 is related to the measured cross - correlation @xmath24 by e_0=t_eff ( ) ^1/4 ( ) ^1/2 [ eq : relazione ] hence , the data are summarized by an observed average squared energy @xmath27 , at @xmath28 standard deviation from the expected value in the case of noise alone , as calculated with the aid of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmar_e ] ) where we put @xmath29 .",
    "the standard deviation , expressed in terms of squared energy , is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmar_e ] ) , in the case @xmath30 , which gives @xmath31 .",
    "according to the model discussed above , in the case of gw signals of energy @xmath32 , we expect @xmath33 to be a random number , modeled with a gaussian probability density function around @xmath34 with a standard deviation @xmath35 : f(e_0 ^ 2|e^2 ) , where @xmath32 is the unknown quantity we wish to infer from the observed value of @xmath26 , given in eq .",
    "[ eq : relazione ] .",
    "this probability inversion is obtained using bayes theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a physics oriented introduction ) : f(e^2|e_0 ^ 2 ) f(e_0 ^ 2|e^2 ) f_(e^2 ) [ eq : bayes ] where @xmath36 is the prior probability density function of observing gw signals of squared energy @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , we are eventually interested in inferring the gw s amplitude @xmath25 , related to the energy @xmath32 by eq .",
    "( [ upperh ] ) .",

    "[ eq : bayesh ] , i.e. @xmath39 is a step function @xmath40 .",

    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . , but rather the probability per decade of @xmath25 , i.e. researchers may feel equally uncertain about the orders of magnitudes of @xmath25 .",

    "[ eq : bayesh ] , a direct consequence of the infinite orders of magnitudes which are equally believed . to get a finite result we need to put a cut - off at a given value of @xmath25 .",

    "[ finaleh ] .",
    "the highest beliefs are for very small values , while values above @xmath42 are practically ruled out . from fig .",
    "[ finaleh ] we obtain an expected value and standard deviation for @xmath25 of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , which fully account for what is perceived as a null result .    in these circumstances , we can provide an upper limit , defined as value @xmath45 , such that there is a given probability for the amplitude of gw s to be below it , i.e. _ 0^h(ul)f(h",
    "|e_0 ^ 2)h = p_l , with @xmath46 the chosen probability level .",
    "results are plotted in fig.[fighh ] .",
    "for example , we can exclude the presence of signals of amplitudes @xmath47 with 95% probability .",
    "probabilistic results depend necessarily on the choice of prior probability density function of @xmath25 .",
    "for example , those firmly convinced that gw burst intensities should be in the @xmath48 region would never allow a 5% chance to @xmath25 above @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , in frontier research particular care has to be used , before stating probabilistic results .",
    "the bayesian approach , thanks to the factorization between likelihood and prior , offers natural ways to a present prior - independent result",
    ". the simple idea would be just to provide the likelihood for each hypothesis under investigation , in our case @xmath50 .",
    "more conveniently , it has been proposed ( @xcite-@xcite ) to publish the likelihood rescaled to the asymptotic limit , where experimental sensitivity is lost completely ; @xmath51 , in our case .",
    "indicating with @xmath52 this rescaled likelihood , we have ( h ) = .",
    "[ eq : rbur_def ] in statistics jargon , this function gives the bayes factor of all @xmath25 hypotheses with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "in intuitive terms , it can be interpreted as a `` relative belief updating ratio '' or a `` probability density function shape distortion function '' , since from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bayesh ] ) we have = .",
    "[ eq : bayesf ] in the present case we get , numerically ( h ) = a h 0 , where @xmath54 is the rescaling factor , @xmath55 and @xmath56 the result is given in fig .",
    "[ loglinrh ] ,    where the choice of the log scale for @xmath25 is to remember that there are infinite orders of magnitudes where the value could be located ( and hence the problem discussed in footnote [ foot:1 ] ) .",
    "interpretation of fig .",
    "[ loglinrh ] , in the light of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rbur_def])-([eq : bayesf ] ) , is straightforward : up to a fraction of @xmath57 the experimental evidence does not produce any change in our belief , while values much larger than @xmath57 are completely ruled out .",
    "the region of transition from @xmath52 from 1 to zero identifies a _ sensitivity bound _ for the experiment .",
    "the exact value of this bound is a matter of convention , and could be , for example , at @xmath58 , or @xmath59 .",
    "we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "note that these bounds have no probabilistic meaning . in any case",
    ", the full result should be considered to be the @xmath52 function , which , being proportional to the likelihood , can easily be used to combine results ( for independent datasets the global likelihood is the product of the likelihoods , and proportional constants can be included in the normalization factor ) .",
    "note that the result given in terms of scaled likelihood and sensitivity bound can not be misleading .",
    "in fact , these results are not probabilistic statements about @xmath25 and no one would imagine they were . on the other hand , ",
    "confidence limits , which are not probabilistic statements on the quantity of interest , tend to be perceived as such ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "using for the first time a cross - correlation method applied to the data of two gw detectors , explorer and nautilus , new experimental upper limits have been determined for the burst intensity causing correlations of gw s with grb s . analyzing the data over 47 grbs , we exclude the presence of signals of amplitude @xmath62 , with 95% probability , with a time window of @xmath63 . with the time window of @xmath64",
    "s , we improve the previous gw upper limit to about @xmath65 .    the result is also given in terms of scaled likelihood and sensitivity bound , which we consider the most complete and unbiased way of providing the experimental information .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we had given more stringent upper limits , but this was under the hypothesis that the gw signals always occur at the same time with respect to the grb arrival time .",
    "here , instead , we only require that the time gap between the grb and the gw burst be within a given time window .",
    "similar comparison can be made with the auriga / batse result @xcite , where an upper limit `` @xmath66 with c.l .",
    "95% '' is estimated under the assumption that gw s arrive at the grb time within a time window of @xmath3 s.    finally , we remark that this method can be applied for any expected delay between grb and gw , with appropriate time shifting of the integration window with respect to the gbr arrival time , according to the prediction of the chosen model .",
