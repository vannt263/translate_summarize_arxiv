    "quantum entanglement , a feature of quantum theory named by schrdinger  @xcite and employed by bell  @xcite in the rejection of local realism , has come to be seen as a resource for quantum information processing tasks including measurement - based quantum computation , teleportation , and some forms of quantum cryptography . driven by applications to computation and communication , entanglement of composite systems of @xmath0 quantum bits , or _ qubits _",
    ", is of particular interest .",
    "the problem of entanglement is to understand nonlocal properties of states and to answer operational questions such as when two given states can be interconverted by local operations on individual subsystems .",
    "this inspires the mathematical problem of classifying orbits of the local unitary group action on the space of states .",
    "the goal of this article is to address these questions for the werner states , which are defined to be those states invariant under the action of any particular single qubit unitary operator acting on all @xmath0 qubits .",
    "werner states have found a multitude of uses in quantum information science . originally introduced in 1989 for two particles  @xcite to distinguish between classical correlation and bell inequality satisfaction , werner states have found use in the description of noisy quantum channels  @xcite , as examples in nonadditivity claims  @xcite , and in the study of deterministic purification  @xcite . in what may prove to be a practical application to computing in noisy environments , werner states lie in the decoherence - free subspace for collective decoherence  @xcite .",
    "a recent example of how analysis of state structure can be useful is the work of migda et al .",
    "@xcite on protecting information against the loss of a qubit using werner states .",
    "we apply the representation theory of lie groups , in particular , clebsch - gordan decomposition of representations of @xmath1 on tensor products and the representation theory of @xmath2 on polynomials in three variables , to obtain structural theorems and local unitary classification for werner states .",
    "we summarize recent results for the special cases of _ pure _ werner states  @xcite and _ symmetric _ werner states  @xcite in section  [ previousresults ] below .",
    "we present new results for the general case of mixed werner states in section  [ mixedwernergeneral ] .",
    "we introduce a generalization of the singlet state and use these states to construct werner states .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the local unitary ( lu ) group for @xmath0-qubit states .",
    "an lu operator @xmath4 acts on an @xmath0-qubit density matrix @xmath5 ( that is , a @xmath6 positive semidefinite matrix with trace 1 ) by @xmath7 in this notation , the werner states are defined to be the set of density matrices @xmath5 such that @xmath8 for all @xmath9 in @xmath1 .",
    "we will write @xmath10 to denote the subgroup @xmath11 of the lu group @xmath12 .    the set of @xmath0-qubit density matrices is a convex set inside of the vector space @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the 4-dimensional real vector space of @xmath15 hermitian matrices .",
    "a convenient basis for @xmath14 is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath15 identity matrix , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the pauli matrices .",
    "every element @xmath5 ( whether or not @xmath5 is positive or has trace 1 ) of @xmath13 can be uniquely written in the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a multiindex with @xmath23 for @xmath24 , and @xmath25 denotes @xmath26 with real coefficients @xmath27 .",
    "sitting inside @xmath13 is the space of pure states , which are the rank 1 density matrices of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a vector in the hilbert space @xmath30 of pure @xmath0-qubit states .",
    "we will use the computational basis vectors @xmath31 for @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a multiindex with @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "the expansion of a pure state vector @xmath29 in the computational basis has the form @xmath36 , where the coefficients @xmath37 are complex .",
    "note that we use the same multiindex notation @xmath38 for `` mod 4 '' multiindices for tensors of pauli matrices in @xmath13 , and for `` mod 2 '' multiindices for computational basis vectors in @xmath32 .",
    "the distinction will be clear from context .",
    "in  @xcite , we prove a structure theorem for pure werner states based on the following geometric construction . begin with a circle with an even number @xmath39 of marked points , labeled 1 through @xmath0 in order around the circle , say clockwise .",
    "let @xmath40 be a partition of @xmath41 into two - element subsets .",
    "each two - element subset @xmath42 determines a chord connecting @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we impose the condition that no two chords coming from @xmath40 may intersect . for each chord @xmath45 in @xmath40 , let @xmath46 be a singlet state @xmath47 in the two qubits at the ends of @xmath45 , and define the state @xmath48 to be the product @xmath49 of singlet states @xmath46 , over all @xmath45 in @xmath40 .",
    "we call states of the form @xmath48 `` non - intersecting chord diagram states ''",
    ". figure  [ spillustrationfig ] illustrates the two possibilities for 4 qubits .",
    "we show that any linear combination of chord diagram states is a werner state , and conversely , any pure werner state can be written uniquely as a linear combination of non - intersecting chord diagram states .",
    "further , these linear combinations are unique representatives of their lu equivalence class , up to a phase factor .",
    "representation theory and combinatorics enter the story in the proof that the non - intersecting chord diagram states span the space of pure werner states .",
    "the werner states are the trivial summand in the decomposition into irreducible submodules of the @xmath1-space @xmath50 .",
    "the dimension of the trivial summand is equal to the catalan number @xmath51 when the number of qubits @xmath39 is even , and the dimension of this space is zero when @xmath0 is odd .",
    "the non - intersecting chord diagrams with @xmath39 nodes are one of the well - known sets enumerated by the catalan numbers  @xcite .",
    "together with an argument that the non - intersecting chord diagram states are linearly independent , the fact that these two numbers agree establishes that the chord diagram states form a linear basis for the space of pure werner states .    in  @xcite",
    ", we consider the case of pure and mixed werner states that are invariant under permutations of qubits , also called _ symmetric _ states .",
    "given nonnegative integers @xmath52 with @xmath53 , we identify the monomial @xmath54 in three variables with the matrix @xmath55 where @xmath56 , the symmetrizing operator @xmath57 sums all the permutations of the products of @xmath58 copies of @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is a normalization factor .",
    "this establishes a correspondence between mixed symmetric states ( not necessarily werner states ) and real polynomials in three variables . using the representation theory of @xmath2 ,",
    "we show that symmetric werner states correspond to polynomials that are linear combinations of @xmath62 for some @xmath63 .",
    "further , any two such states are local unitarily inequivalent .",
    "now we turn to the general case of mixed werner states .",
    "we begin with the construction of a family of density matrices @xmath64 that generalize the singlet state .    given an @xmath0-qubit binary string @xmath38 , let @xmath65 denote the pure state @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the the cyclic permutation of @xmath41 given by @xmath69 , @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and @xmath61 is a normalizing factor so that @xmath72 , whenever @xmath73 ( notice that @xmath74 , so is not a state ) .",
    "for example , @xmath75 let @xmath64 denote the density matrix @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a normalizing factor so that @xmath78 . observe that @xmath79 is the density matrix @xmath80 of the singlet state @xmath81 , so that the @xmath64 states are @xmath0-qubit generalizations of the singlet .",
    "next we form products of @xmath82 states to make werner states and the diagram states constructed from them are indeed werner states .",
    "this can be done with straightforward calculations , but at the expense of technical overhead .",
    "we refer the interested reader to our paper  @xcite which gives details on the action of the lie algebra of the local unitary group on density matrices .",
    "one can show that the generators of the lie algebra of the werner stabilizer group @xmath83 annihilate @xmath64 . ] .",
    "as with the case of pure werner states , we utilize diagrams .",
    "this time we consider diagrams consisting of @xmath0 points labeled @xmath84 on a circle , with non - intersecting polygons that have vertices in the given set of @xmath0 points .",
    "again , there are a catalan number @xmath85 of such @xmath0-vertex diagrams points in our pure werner states analysis of the previous section . given a non - intersecting chord diagram with @xmath86 vertices ,",
    "rename the vertices @xmath87 and then glue each pair of @xmath88 for @xmath89 . ]",
    "@xcite .    given an @xmath0-vertex non - intersecting polygon diagram @xmath90",
    ", we construct a state @xmath91 @xmath92 where the tensor has positions specified by elements of the partition @xmath90 and @xmath93 denotes the state @xmath94 in qubit positions in @xmath95 .",
    "figure  [ diagramstate5fig ] shows an example .    here is our main conjecture .",
    "* conjecture . * the states",
    "@xmath91 form a basis for the space of werner states ( in the larger space of real linear combinations of pauli tensors ) .",
    "again , representation theory says that we have the right dimension : the 1-qubit density matrix representation space @xmath14 decomposes into irreducible @xmath1-submodules as @xmath96 where the @xmath97 summand is isomorphic to the adjoint representation .",
    "the complexification @xmath98 is isomorphic to @xmath99 , which is 2-qubit pure state space . in general ,",
    "the complexification @xmath100 of @xmath0-qubit density matrix space @xmath13 is isomorphic to @xmath86-qubit pure state space , as @xmath1 spaces .",
    "thus the real dimension of the trivial summand for @xmath0-qubit density matrices is equal to the complex dimension of the trivial summand for @xmath86-qubit pure states , which is the catalan number @xmath101 .",
    "this establishes that we only need to show that the diagram states are independent in order to prove the conjecture .",
    "we conclude with a conjecture regarding a precise statement about the stabilizer subgroup of the local unitary group for our constructed werner states .",
    "the full stabilizer of a werner state @xmath5 , that is , the set @xmath102 of all local unitary transformations that fix @xmath5 , could be larger than the subgroup @xmath10 of the unitary group .",
    "for example , a diagram state @xmath91 is stabilized by the subgroup @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes the subgroup that consists of elements @xmath105 in qubits in @xmath95 , and all other coordinates are the identity .    in  @xcite , we give a criterion on the diagrams that appear in the expansion of a pure werner state for when the stabilizer subgroup of a pure werner state is precisely the subgroup @xmath10 of the local unitary group , and not larger .",
    "the criterion is that for any bipartition of the set of qubits , there must be a diagram ( with nonzero coefficient ) in the expansion of the given state that has a chord with one end in each of the sets of the partition .",
    "our final conjecture is a generalization of this idea to the general mixed werner case .",
    "consider a poset lattice of partitions of @xmath41 ( we consider all partitions , with and without crossing polygons ) where @xmath106 if @xmath107 is a subdivision of @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath0-gon is the least element at the bottom and the all - singleton diagram is the greatest element at the top of this lattice .",
    "the non - crossing polygon diagram lattice is a sublattice .",
    "there is a corresponding lattice of subgroups of local unitary group @xmath12 , where @xmath109 is less than or equal to @xmath110 in the partial order if @xmath109 is a subgroup of @xmath110 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath10 is the least element at the bottom and @xmath111 at the top .",
    "a diagram @xmath90 corresponds to the subgroup @xmath112 defined above .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath113 where `` glb '' denotes greatest lower bound in the lattice . this would give a picture criterion for when a werner state has the werner stabilizer ( and not a larger one ) .",
    "we have surveyed known results on the structure and local unitary equivalence classification of werner states for the special cases of pure states and symmetric states .",
    "we have presented a diagram based construction for the general case of mixed werner states that generalizes the `` sums of products of singlets '' construction known for pure states .",
    "finally , we conjecture that the general construction will prove to be a basis for the werner states , and that this basis will lead to local unitary classification and a precise analysis of stabilizer subgroups .          j.  s. bell . on the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox .",
