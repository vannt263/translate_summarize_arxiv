    "the emission of @xmath0 particles and nuclear fission are the two dominant spontaneous decay modes of heavy and super - heavy nuclei . in both cases",
    "two nuclei are produced . in @xmath0 decay one @xmath6he nucleus ( @xmath0 particle )",
    "is emitted out of the parent nucleus and the remaining nucleons form a heavy mass residue with @xmath7 neutrons and @xmath8 protons .",
    "in contrast to the huge mass asymmetry of @xmath0 decay , two nuclei of similar mass are created in nuclear fission . a large variety of isotopes are produced in spontaneous fission with masses covering the range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . in many heavy nuclei",
    "the dominant decay channel corresponds to asymmetric fission with the most probable mass of heavy fragment @xmath11 and the mass of the light one in the range from @xmath12 to @xmath13 depending on the mass of parent nucleus .",
    "symmetric fission is also possible in some nuclei with the most probable division into two similar fragments .",
    "daughter nuclei lighter than @xmath14 have never been observed in any fission experiment .",
    "therefore there is a clear distinction between @xmath0 emission and fission regarding the mass of the lighter products as it shows a gap of light nuclei with @xmath15 that can not be produced in none of the two mentioned decay channels of any heavy nuclei .",
    "the source of the observed differences can be easily explained from basic nuclear properties , namely the energetic balance of the two reactions .",
    "fission is favorable energetically because of the linear decreasing behavior of the binding energy per nucleon for mass numbers larger than @xmath16 ( the iron peak ) that prevents fragments with mass numbers lower than that value . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 decays energetics is dominated by the huge binding energy ( as compared to neighboring nuclei ) of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "a common aspect of fission and @xmath0 decay is that the dynamical evolution from the parent nucleus to the daughter is not favorable energetically , although the @xmath17 value of both reactions is positive .",
    "therefore the quantum mechanics mechanism of tunneling through a potential barrier is required to explain both types of decay . as tunneling probabilities depend exponentially on the width and height of the barrier",
    "the expected half - lives can span a wide range of many orders of magnitude .",
    "this peculiarity makes the understanding of fission and @xmath0 decay very challenging .    in 1984 rose and jones @xcite observed for the first time the emission of the @xmath1c nucleus from the @xmath18ra probe .",
    "this discovery represented a milestone in the description of nuclear radioactivity as it bridged the gap between the @xmath0 emission radioactivity and the standard fission reaction .",
    "since then , cluster radioactivity ( cr ) has been found in twelve even - even isotopes @xcite and seven odd - even isotopes ( see e.g. references in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the actinide region .",
    "they range from @xmath19fr up to @xmath5 cm . the emission of @xmath1c , @xmath20o , @xmath21f , @xmath22ne , @xmath23 mg and @xmath24si has been observed .",
    "the common factor of all cluster radioactivity events is the heavy - mass residue which is in the neighborhood of the doubly - magic @xmath3pb .",
    "this fact allows us to better characterize cr as  lead radioactivity \" and indicates strong influence of shell effects on the nature of this phenomenon .",
    "experiments aiming to find cr in the distant region of the neutron deficient ba isotopes have been described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "another doubly - magic nucleus , namely @xmath25sn , can be considered as the heavy residue and the carbon isotopes around @xmath26c are expected to be emitted .",
    "the experiments did not provide evidence for cr in this region and quantitatively they only gave lower limits for the branching ratios for @xmath26c emission .",
    "cr is an exotic process .",
    "the partial half - lives are very long and vary in the wide range from @xmath27  s to @xmath28  s. branching ratios to the dominant @xmath0 decay in these nuclei are very small and are comprised between @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "moreover spontaneous fission is also a competing decay channel in some heavy cluster emitters @xcite .",
    "these reasons clearly justify why cr was experimentally discovered as late as 45 years after the first fission events which were reported back in 1939 @xcite . in the last few decades and thanks to both the interest raised by the phenomenon and the impressive improvement of experimental techniques",
    "many examples of cr have been found in several actinide nuclei .",
    "various experimental methods have been applied to detect the products of cluster emission @xcite .",
    "first observations were based on techniques borrowed from the @xmath0 decay studies .",
    "a @xmath31 telescope made of silicon detectors was used by rose and jones in the first experiment @xcite .",
    "this method was inconvenient due to huge @xmath0 radioactivity background which could even destroy the experimental set - up .",
    "later , a magnetic field was applied to remove the background of charged @xmath0 particles .",
    "another method used in experiments was the detection of gamma rays emitted from exited clusters .",
    "numerous clusters were identified in the solid state nuclear track detectors . in this technique plastic or glass layers",
    "absorb the ionized cluster emitted from the radioactive probe .",
    "the material of the layer can not be sensitive to @xmath0 radiation and plastic or glass materials with proper ionization thresholds are the standard choices .",
    "after irradiation , the layer is etched to enlarge the track created by the emitted cluster as to be visible and well defined under the microscope .",
    "the analysis of the geometry of the track allows to identify the emitted cluster .    in the theoretical side ,",
    "the first successful theoretical description of cluster decay was made by sandulescu _",
    "_ @xcite four years before the experimental discovery of this reaction .",
    "since the pioneer work of sandulescu , numerous theoretical papers devoted to this end have been published @xcite .",
    "a thorough overview of most of the theoretical ( mostly semi - microscopic ) methods can be found in refs . @xcite .",
    "as cr is a decay mode  in between \" @xmath0 emission and nuclear fission , methods already known to both of them can be used to describe cluster radioactivity .",
    "for instance , the gamow model of @xmath0 emission can be extrapolated to describe the emission of heavier clusters .",
    "it requires the assumption that a cluster of nucleons is preformed in the interior of parent nucleus and then it tunnels the barrier of nuclear and coulomb potential .",
    "in this way a kind of universal decay law similar to the geiger - nuttall formula for @xmath0 emission can be formulated @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of this approach is that the preformation of the cluster inside the parent nucleus is a poorly known and hard to characterize process .",
    "nevertheless the half - lives predicted by this method agree very well with the experimental data .",
    "the other method treats cluster radioactivity as a very asymmetric fission reaction ( see e.g. refs .",
    "the formation of the cluster is a direct consequence of a specific kind of deformation of the parent nucleus . in this approach a fission barrier with a specific mass division",
    "must be determined .",
    "locally maximal barrier transition probability for the specific fragments with large mass asymmetry points out for possibility of fission with cluster as one of the fragments .",
    "usually the potential energy surface ( pes ) has to be determined as a function of the relevant deformation parameters , including elongation and reflection asymmetry coordinates .",
    "the path in this multidimensional deformation surface leading to fission with large fragment mass asymmetry has to be found and , finally , the fission barrier must be specified .",
    "we want to show that cr can be fully described microscopically as a very asymmetric fission process .",
    "we apply standard methods used in the theoretical description of nuclear fission which are well established in the literature .",
    "we use the mean - field approximation in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) scheme with the finite range gogny force @xcite to compute the nuclear wave functions .",
    "axial symmetry of the nuclear system is assumed all along the calculations .",
    "constrains on the quadrupole and octupole moments allows to control simultaneously the elongation and reflection asymmetry of the system as it evolves to the scission point .",
    "the wave functions obtained in this way can be used to calculate the necessary quantities ( energies , collective masses , etc ) for a physical description of the process .",
    "moreover extra constraint on the number of nucleon in the neck ( the neck thickness ) has been used to control the density distribution around a scission point .",
    "description of cr is possible thanks to the identification of a new valley in the pes leading to hyper - asymmetric fission .",
    "charge and mass numbers of the light fragment created at the hyper - asymmetric scission point correspond to what is observed experimentally for a given nucleus .",
    "contrary to the standard fission path where the leading coordinate is the quadrupole moment , in the hyper - asymmetric fission path the relevant coordinate turns out to be the octupole moment .",
    "therefore , in our description of cr , all physical quantities will be given in terms of the octupole moment .",
    "first results obtained in this approach have been published in the previous papers @xcite . cr of selected nuclei have been discussed there with some approximations of the model .    in this paper",
    "we want to investigate from a microscopic perspective all even - even actinide nuclei where cluster radioactivity has been experimentally detected .",
    "there are twelve such isotopes , namely : @xmath32ra , @xmath33th , @xmath34u , @xmath35pu , and @xmath5 cm .",
    "moreover , other three nuclei ( @xmath36th , @xmath37pu ) , where experiments have only provided lower limits for half - lives of cr , have been examined .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the theoretical model used in this investigation is described in details .",
    "two typical and representative examples of cluster radioactivity corresponding to the parent nuclei @xmath38ra and @xmath39pu are thoroughly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] as to establish the relevant physics driving the cluster emission process .",
    "results for all the fifteen nuclei considered in this paper are presented in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] with the main consequences extracted from our theoretical description .",
    "as a first step in our theoretical description of cluster emission we solve the mean field hfb equation @xcite with the usual constraints on the average number of particles and , in the present case , with a constraint on the value of the mass multipole moments @xmath40 to analyze the physical contents of the process .",
    "the axial quadrupole ( @xmath41 ) , octupole ( @xmath42 ) and hexadecapole ( @xmath43 ) moments are defined through the standard legendre polynomials @xmath44    the non - linear hfb equation is solved using the gradient method @xcite and taking into account approximately second order curvature effects @xcite .",
    "the hfb quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators are expanded in a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis and special attention is paid to the convergence of the results with the basis size ( see appendix [ appa ] for further details ) .",
    "the interaction used is the finite range gogny force with the d1s parameterization @xcite .",
    "this interaction has proven to successfully describe the fission process in heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the other gogny forces , developed recently : d1n @xcite and d1 m @xcite are discussed in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "other details of the hfb calculations are as follows : the two body kinetic energy correction ( 2bkec ) has been included in the minimization process .",
    "the exchange coulomb contribution is evaluated in the slater approximation .",
    "all calculations have been performed in the axially symmetric regime .",
    "it seems to be a rational choice as the systems studied tend to be built from a large spherical part reproducing properties of doubly - magic nuclei with a small additional part .",
    "the lighter fragment is often spherical in the ground state .",
    "therefore , the influence of non  axial effects is expected to be rather small , if any , and may only affect the shape of the barrier just before scission reducing slightly its height .    to evaluate the pes we take into account correlation energies beyond the mean field .",
    "to this end we subtract from the hfb energy the rotational energy corrections ( rec ) stemming from the restoration of the rotational symmetry .",
    "this correction has a considerable influence on the energy landscape ( and therefore on the height of fission barriers ) as it is proportional to the degree of rotational symmetry breaking .",
    "a full calculation of the rec would imply the evaluation of the angular momentum projected energy @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this kind of beyond mean field calculations is only feasible for light nuclei with present day computer capabilities . in order to estimate the rec we have followed the usual recipe @xcite ( which is well justified for strongly deformed configurations ) of subtracting to the hfb energy the quantity @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the fluctuation on angular momentum of the hfb wave function and @xmath47 is the yoccoz moment of inertia @xcite .",
    "this moment of inertia has been computed using the `` cranking '' approximation in which the full linear response matrix appearing in its expression is replaced by the zero order approximation ( that is , the sum of two quasiparticle energies ) .",
    "the impact of this approximation in the value of the yoccoz moment of inertia was analyzed with the gogny interaction for heavy nuclei in @xcite by comparing the approximate value with the one extracted from a complete angular momentum projected calculation ( see also @xcite for a comparison in light nuclei ) .",
    "the conclusion is that , for strongly deformed configurations , the exact rec is roughly a factor 0.7 smaller than the one computed with the  cranking \" approximation to the yoccoz moment of inertia .",
    "it has also to be mentioned that a similar behavior has been observed for the differences between the thouless - valatin moment of inertia computed exactly and in the `` cranking '' approximation @xcite .",
    "we have taken this phenomenological factor into account in our calculation of the rec .    in sec .",

    "this zpe correction is given by    @xmath61    where    @xmath62    finally , in the expression for the action an additional parameter @xmath63 is introduced .",
    "this parameter can be taken as the hfb energy of the ( metastable ) ground state .",
    "however , it is argued that in a quantal treatment of the problem the ground state energy is given by the hfb energy plus the zpe associated to the collective motion . to account for this fact , the usual recipe is to add an estimation of the zpe to the hfb energy in order to obtain @xmath63 . in our calculations",
    "we have considered this zpe as a phenomenological parameter and given a reasonable value of 0.5 mev for all the isotopes considered @xcite .",

    "this is the typical scenario of fission in many heavy nuclei leading to asymmetric fission . such valley",
    "is usually called  elongated fission valley \" @xcite as the shapes of the nucleus along it are relatively stretched with a long neck coupling a typically spherical and a typically prolate - deformed nascent fragments .",
    "the value of the fission barrier height is around 10 mev which is a value a little bit larger than values usually calculated in the heavy actinides .",

    "[ map ] one can also find a second valley on the pes that goes from the ground state through the reflection asymmetric shapes with non - zero octupole moment .",
    "the huge octupole moment values obtained for small elongation suggests a large asymmetry in the mass distribution .",
    "as the saddle point is reached , the matter density distribution starts to resemble a molecular shape with a small sphere touching a larger one .",
    "the large spherical fragment has a number of protons and neutrons that is consistent with those of @xmath3pb .",
    "this observation points towards a clear relationship between this valley and the phenomenon of cr .",

    "the elongation of the nucleus rises along with reflection asymmetry .",
    "moreover , the fission path creates a straight line in the figure  [ map ] , as the growth of the quadrupole moment is proportional to the increase of the octupole moment .            in fig .",

    "its height is extremely large in comparison with classical fission barrier .",
    "this implies very long half - lives for the decay along this channel ( over @xmath77 s ) and explains why the cr path was ignored so far as the possible fission path .",
    "the experimental evidences of cr , which is characterized by half - lives of the same order of magnitude , enforce to consider the hyper - asymmetric path as the possible exotic decay channel .    the evolution of the shapes of nuclei along the cr path from ground state to the saddle point",

    "a bifurcation can be found in the cr path of @xmath38ra .",

    "some important information can be deduced from these plots .",
    "first , the system is built from two almost spherical fragments .",
    "the space between their surfaces is wide for at least a few femtometers and increase with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the heavier fragment is the doubly - magic spherical @xmath3pb after scission of @xmath38ra or @xmath82pb in the case of @xmath39pu .",
    "the lighter fragment may be slightly deformed ( prolate or oblate ) .",
    "its shape is mostly determined by the shape of the ground state of the corresponding nucleus as the coulomb interaction with the heavier fragment is not strong enough . in the case of @xmath83 mg emitted from @xmath39pu ,",
    "the ground state is oblate ( @xmath84 ) @xcite . in the other nucleus",
    ", the spherical @xmath1c isotope constitutes the lighter fragment of the cr from @xmath38ra .",
    "once the system has split in two , the shapes of the fragments do not change significantly as they move apart and the increase of the total quadrupole and octupole momenta is a consequence of the increasing distance between the fragments . therefore",
    "the change in the potential energy after scission is mainly due to the decreasing of coulomb repulsion and it should decline hyperbolically with the distance between the centers of fragments , which is roughly proportional to @xmath41 . such behavior can be seen in fig .",
    "[ barq2 ] close to the saddle point .",
    "however , for larger deformations we observe a departure from the expected behavior that calls for larger basis .",
    "unfortunately , the use of larger basis can be problematic as a consequence of numerical instabilities in the evaluation of matrix elements due to finite computer accuracy .",
    "those instabilities lead in some cases to strange behaviors in the energy preventing the use of very large basis ( see also appendix [ appa ] where the convergence of the energy is discussed ) . to avoid these difficulties , which are critical for the determination of half - lives in the wkb scheme",
    ", we have adopted an approximate strategy to be discussed in sec .",

    "[ shapes224 ] where an unnatural stretching towards large @xmath85 values can be noticed .",
    "the solution of the hfb equation often depends on the nuclear matter distributions of the initial wave function used in the iterative procedure . in many regions of the pes , especially close to the scission line",
    ", two solutions may be obtained for the same constrains . if the calculation begins with a compact shape of the nucleus , the final solution will have similar properties . if a configuration with two separated fragments is chosen as the initial condition , again a solution with similar properties will be found .",

    "the properties of d1 m have been tested in several scenarios @xcite with very promising results .",
    "it is interesting to test the performance of the three parameterizations in the very demanding scenario of cr and to this end we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ d1snm ] the results for the pes of cr for the nucleus @xmath39pu obtained with the three parameterizations .",
    "the shape of the pes is similar in the three cases although the hyper - asymmetric fission barrier is 2 mev higher in d1n and 3 mev in d1 m than in d1s .",
    "the predicted cluster is the same @xmath83 mg nucleus in all three parameterizations .",
    "the changes of the barrier heights lead to an increase of the cr half - lives . for the d1 m parameter set in the case of emission of @xmath83 mg from @xmath39pu",
    "we get @xmath155)=34.33 $ ] ( without zpe correction added ) and for the d1n force @xmath155)=32.28 $ ] in comparison with @xmath155)=30.42 $ ] for the d1s parameterization .",
