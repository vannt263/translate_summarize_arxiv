    "<S> the basic idea is that the real or virtual photon interacts with a correlated pair of nucleons which are emitted from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> though the study of this process has been proposed long time ago @xcite , only recently , with the advent of the high  intensity monochromatic photon beams and 100%duty cycle electron beams , the technical difficulties in performing this kind of experiments with adequate statistics have been overcome .    </S>",
    "<S> the simple picture presented above involves one - body electromagnetic operators and short  range correlations only , however , other mechanisms contribute to the two  nucleon emission , for example meson exchange current ( mec ) and final state interactions , and this complicates the analysis of the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore necessary to deal with experimental situations where the alternative emission mechanisms can be disentangled , or to find kinematical conditions where the emission via src becomes the dominant one .    for these reasons it is important to avoid those energy regions dominated by collective excitations of the nucleus , such as the giant resonance region , because in these regions the multi  </S>",
    "<S> nucleon emission is mainly induced by the residual interaction via the excitation of many particle  </S>",
    "<S> many hole configurations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also another reason , a more pragmatical one , to avoid the kinematical regions with relatively low excitation energy . in these regions </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energy is just above the two  nucleon emission threshold , the phase space available for the two nucleons emitted is quite small and , as a consequence , the cross sections are rather small .    </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore mandatory to work , at least , at the excitation energies where the quasi  elastic peak shows up . in this region , however , the emission mechanism we want to study , competes with the two  nucleon emission produced by mec @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since mec are active predominantly in the transverse response , there is the hope that the two - nucleon emission in the longitudinal response would be dominated by src effects .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of a calculation of the two  nucleon emission contribution to the inclusive ( e , e ) longitudinal response . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation has been done for the @xmath0c nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> the model we have developed to describe the process is based upon the correlated basis function ( cbf ) theory @xcite , but it considers only the terms up to a single correlation line .    in cbf theory the many  body schrdinger equation is solved by means of the variational principle within a subspace of wave functions of the type : @xmath1 is a slater determinant built up with a set of single particle wave functions properly chosen , and @xmath2 is the correlation function . the variational method with the ansatz of eq .  ( [ corst ] ) has been successfully used to describe few - body systems @xcite , light nuclei @xcite and infinite systems @xcite , nevertheless , its application to medium and heavy nuclei is still at the beginning stages . </S>",
    "<S> recently , promising attempts to extend cbf theory to these last nuclear systems have been carried out with the help of the fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) technology @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the known difficulties related to a fhnc calculations in finite nuclear systems , our presents a further complication due to the fact that it is necessary to extend the fhnc theory to the description of the nuclear excited states , in the same spirit of what has been done in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for nuclear matter .    for these reasons </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a model which is an extension of those models used some time ago to calculate ground state density and momentum distributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these models consider only those terms of the cluster expansion containing a single correlation line . </S>",
    "<S> a test of the validity of these models have been recently done comparing their results with those obtained using the same input in a full fhnc calculation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement obtained in this comparison gives us the hope that a truncation of the cluster expansion to the terms with a single correlation line could work also for the description of nuclear transitions , at least for those induced by the charge operator .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic hypothesis of our work lies in the ansatz of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ corst ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function @xmath2 is extremely complicated and it has the same operator structure of the nucleon  nucleon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> realistic cbf calculations @xcite@xcite show that the scalar term of the correlation function greatly dominates on the other ones . </S>",
    "<S> this does not mean , however , that the so  called state dependent terms of the correlation can be neglected because their effect is small . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the tensor correlations , are extremely important in the calculation of the binding energy @xcite , and probably they play a crucial role in setting the magnitude of the mec @xcite in the quasi  elastic peak . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> in this work we consider the charge operator , which has only an isospin dependence , and we believe that for this operator the effects of the states dependent terms of the correlation should be small . for this reason , and to simplify the calculations , we have considered a purely scalar correlation function of the form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the distance between the particles @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    </S>",

    "<S> we have been guided by the rule that the terms considered should provide an approximate amplitude @xmath17 satisfying the limit of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xilim ] ) .    this model can be used to calculate transitions leading to final states with one or two particles in the continuum . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the two  nucleon emission , and for this process our model produces 4 two  point diagrams and 12 three  point diagrams .    </S>",
    "<S> the three point diagrams describe the situation where three particle are correlated , in spite of the fact that only one two - point ( dynamical ) correlation is present . in these diagrams , in addition to the dynamical correlation , also a statistical correlation , generated by the antisymmetrization of the many - body wave function under the exchange of two particle is acting .    </S>",
    "<S> considering the symmetry properties of the correlation function , @xmath18 , and the fact that some of this diagrams are obtained exchanging particle and hole lines , these 16 diagrams reduce to the 8 topologically distinguished diagrams shown in fig .  1 . a more thorough description of the model will be provided in a forthcoming publication .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculations we discuss in the following have been done for the @xmath0c nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> this nucleus is relatively light , it has only four hole single particle states , and therefore calculations are less time consuming than for heavier nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we have thoroughly studied the quasi  elastic response of this nucleus @xcite and this experience gives us some insight in the details of the configuration space to be used . </S>",
    "<S> in this respect , all our calculations have been done with the set of single particle wave functions generated by a woods  saxon potential used in our previous quasi  elastic peak calculations . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to notice that the same set of single particle wave functions has been used in the fhnc calculations of ref . </S>",

    "<S> the full and the dashed lines represent the gaussian and aca euler correlations used in the fhnc calculations of ref . @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the third correlation we have used ( dotted line ) corresponds to the scalar part of the nuclear matter correlation determined in the fhnc calculations of ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we have also considered the omy correlation @xcite , represented by the dashed dotted line , because it has been widely used in the literature .    as far as we know , the ( e , e2n ) calculations performed up to now @xcite consider only two  point diagrams ( the a and b diagrams of fig .  1 ) . in these calculations </S>",
    "<S> the normalization of the wave function is not conserved because the limit of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xilim ] ) is not satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> a first aspect to be investigated with our model is then the importance of the three  point diagrams necessary to fulfill eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xilim ] ) at the first order in the correlation line .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 we show the results we have obtained for the contribution of the two  nucleon emission to the inclusive longitudinal responses for three values of the momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations have been performed with the gaussian correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the full lines show the results found with all the diagrams , while the dashed lines have been obtained considering only the two  point diagrams .    </S>",
    "<S> this figure shows that the contributions of the two and three  point diagrams sum up to each other . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained analogous results for all the correlations functions considered . </S>",
    "<S> this result is , in principle , surprising , since , from our previous experience in the calculation of density and momentum distributions @xcite , we expected big cancelations between two and three  point contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> in reality the correlations play different roles in the two cases . in the ground state </S>",
    "<S> the correlations effects remodel the shape of the mean - field charge distribution without changing the total charge . in this case , every two  point diagram is coupled to a three  point diagram of opposite sign , which , in the limit of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xilim ] ) , cancels exactly the contribution of the two  point diagram ( the uncorrelated charge distribution is already correctly normalised ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the response the three  point diagrams offer an additional mechanism of emitting two nucleons , enlarging the available phase space , and therefore their contribution to the response adds up to that of the two - point diagrams .    </S>",
    "<S> a second aspect we want to investigate is the sensitivity of the results to the correlation chosen . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 we show the full responses ( that is including two plus three  point diagrams ) obtained with the various correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> the same convention as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 has been used for the different curves . </S>",
    "<S> one should notice that , in the figure , the responses obtained with the omy correlation ( dashed dotted lines ) have been divided by a factor 10 . </S>",
    "<S> all the other responses are of the same order of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained with the gaussian correlation are very similar to those obtained with the nuclear matter one , as expected because of the large similitude between these correlations one can observe in fig .  2 .    the results of fig </S>",
    "<S> .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 show high sensitivity to the details of the correlation function </S>",
    "<S> . our approach does not provide any prescription to choose among the correlations we have used . on the other hand , in cbf theory the correlation functions are chosen together with the single particle wave functions in a way to minimize the ground state energy of the system . the lack of an internal criterion to link single particle wave functions and </S>",
    "<S> correlation is a weak point of our approach . </S>",
    "<S> we think this problem can be overcome by taking these inputs from a microscopic calculation of the ground state energy .    in the calculations we have presented , </S>",
    "<S> this has been done , at least partially , for the gaussian and aca euler correlations which , for this set of single particle wave functions , minimize the binding energy of @xmath0c when the s3 nucleon  nucleon interaction is used . </S>",
    "<S> there is not link between single particle wave functions and the omy correlation , which produces responses one order of magnitude bigger than the other ones . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 is not fully correct , because we should have compared results obtained with correlations and single particle wave functions modified to minimize the nuclear binding energy .    </S>",
    "<S> let s summarize the main messages of this report .    </S>",
    "<S> 1 .   in order to get the proper normalization of the wave function in a model considering only terms up to the first order in the correlation line it is necessary to include both two and three  point diagrams </S>",
    "<S> . 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the three - point diagrams adds strength to the response , contrary to the case of the ground state expectation values , where a strong cancelation between two and three  point diagrams is found . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> a relation between single particle wave functions and correlation functions is necessary to have physically meaningful results .    before concluding we would like to make some general remarks about our model . </S>",
    "<S> as we have said , we infer the validity of our model from the fact that the results of the ground state density and momentum distribution were quite similar to those obtained with the fhnc calculation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not claim that models considering only first order terms in the correlation can be blindly applied to any operator . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the good results obtained for the ground state expectation values of the charge distribution are related to the peculiar characteristics of this operator . because of this , we feel quite confident of our model devised for the calculation of responses , but we think that a comparison with fhnc responses is a necessary test . </S>",
