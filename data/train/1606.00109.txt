    "over the past decade , gapped quantum spin systems have attracted considerable attention owing to their variety of phase transitions .",
    "the gapped ground state is typically a spin - singlet with an excitation gap @xmath12 to the lowest excited state .",
    "the complete suppression of @xmath12 by varying external parameters often triggers a phase transition .",
    "in particular , a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) which is a continuous phase transition occurring at zero temperature ( @xmath1 ) as a consequence of quantum fluctuations is the fundamental subject that correlates condensed matter physics with particle physics@xcite .",
    "it is well established that the transition point , commonly known as the quantum critical point ( qcp ) , can be accessed continuously by applying a magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) and/or hydrostatic pressure ( @xmath2 ) . the field - induced qpt differs from the pressure - induced qpt in terms of the universality class of the qcp .",
    "for the former and latter qpts , magnetic excitations have quadratic and linear dispersion relations , respectively , at the qcp , where the excited mode becomes gapless .",
    "recent intensive studies have shown that a field - induced qpt to an xy antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase can be described in the context of the bose ",
    "einstein condensation ( bec ) of magnon quasiparticles@xcite . the uniaxial symmetry around the applied field in the spin hamiltonian [ @xmath13(2 ) ]",
    "is effectively translated into the conservation of the total number of particles [ @xmath14(1 ) ] .",
    "this concept is useful for understanding a qpt from the standpoint of a dilute bose gas system .",
    "experimentally , the magnon bec scenario has been examined using several gapped quantum magnets@xcite .",
    "however , the focus has mostly been on systems with weakly coupled spin dimers such as tlcucl@xmath0@xcite and bacusi@xmath15o@xmath16@xcite .",
    "a pressure - induced qpt in quantum spin systems is also of importance , particularly because it provides a rare opportunity to directly identify the massive higgs mode separately from the massless nambu ",
    "goldstone mode .",
    "the higgs mode is a collective mode of amplitude oscillations of order parameters@xcite .",
    "a requirement for observing the higgs mode is shrinkage of the ordered moment in zero applied field , as realized in the pressure - induced ordered phase . thus far , to our knowledge , tlcucl@xmath0@xcite and kcucl@xmath0@xcite are the only quantum magnets for which a pressure - induced qpt to the ordered phase has been established .",

    "the low - temperature ( lt ) magnetic moment of fe@xmath19 in an octahedral environment is determined by the lowest orbital triplet @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "this orbital triplet splits into three singlet and six doublets owing to spin - orbit coupling and the uniaxial crystal field , which are expressed together as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the effective angular momentum with @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the true spin with @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the reduction factor , which expresses the fact that the matrix elements of the angular momentum @xmath25 are reduced owing to the mixing of the @xmath30 orbitals of the surrounding cl@xmath20 with the @xmath31 orbitals of fe@xmath19 .",
    "when the temperature @xmath1 is much lower than the magnitude of the spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath32 @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34k , the magnetic property is determined by the lowest singlet and doublet , which are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , with @xmath37 . when the fecl@xmath16 octahedron is trigonally elongated , as observed in csfecl@xmath0 , the energy of the @xmath35 state is lower than that of the @xmath38 state . hence , using the effective spin @xmath39 , the lt magnetic properties of csfecl@xmath0 can be described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath40 where the first term is the single - ion anisotropy ( @xmath41 ) corresponding to the energy difference between the @xmath38 and @xmath35 states , and the second and third terms are the fm exchange interaction in the chain and the af exchange interaction in the @xmath22-plane , respectively .",
