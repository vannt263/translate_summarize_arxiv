    "ocean currents are generated by local and remote forces and factors , including winds , tides , buoyancy fluxes and various types of waves .",
    "while many studies have investigated the distribution of the wind @xcite , focusing on its relevance to energy production , the distribution of ocean currents has received much less attention @xcite . moreover , currently there is no accepted theory explaining the observed statistics of surface ocean currents .    here",
    ", we propose a simple physical theory for the distribution of wind - driven ocean currents and its relation to the spatially variable temporal correlations of the wind ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we show that the distribution of wind - driven ocean currents strongly depends on the temporal correlations of the wind  when the wind exhibits long - range temporal correlations , the ocean current statistics is proportional to the wind - stress statistics , while for short - range correlations of the wind , the different components of the current vector follow gaussian distributions .",
    "it was previously reported that the probability density function ( pdf ) of ocean currents follows the weibull distribution @xcite ( see section [ sec : weibull ] for the details of the weibull distribution ) ; we argue that this is not necessarily the case even if the wind - stress magnitude is weibull distributed .",
    "oceans play a major and important role in the climate system , and ocean circulation underlies many climate phenomena , from scales of meters to thousands of kilometers and from scales of minutes to decades .",
    "the gap in our understanding of ocean current statistics leads to a lack in understanding the statistics of other related climate variables .",
    "filling in this gap will be useful in many fields : it may help to predict extreme current events and , thus , may help to securely design maritime - associated structures . in light of the increasing efforts to find alternative sources of energy and the idea of using ocean currents as such a source , knowledge of the currents pdf may help to better estimate the energy production and to appropriately design ocean current turbines that will withstand even extreme current events .",
    "moreover , knowledge regarding current statistics and , in particular , its relation to the wind - stress statistics may improve the parametrization of small - scale processes in state - of - the - art general circulation models ( gcms ) .",
    "the study of wind - driven ocean currents goes back more than 100 years , to the time when ekman @xcite proposed his classical simple model to explain the effect of the earth s rotation on upper ocean currents .",
    "his model predicted that the depth - integrated current vector is perpendicular to the wind vector , a prediction that was largely proven by observations .",
    "since then , many studies have used ekman s model to propose more realistic models for ocean currents , as well as for surface winds @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we use ekman s model @xcite to study the statistics of wind - driven ocean currents .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we describe the ekman layer model and provide a general ( implicit ) solution expressed in terms of the characteristics of the wind - stress statistics . in section",
    "[ sec : ic ] , we consider two idealized cases of wind - stress statistics ( step - like temporal behavior of the wind - stress in section [ sec : slws ] and exponentially decaying temporal wind - stress correlation in section [ sec : ouws ] ) and present analytical expressions for the second moment ( and fourth moment for the first case ) of the currents distribution . in section [ sec : mitgcm ] , we provide a description of the simple numerical model and of the oceanic gcm ( mitgcm ) used to validate and extend the analytical results .",
    "the numerical tests involve the weibull distribution ; hence , a brief review of the distribution properties and the methods we used to generate correlated and uncorrelated weibull - distributed time series is provided in [ sec : weibull ] .",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed in section [ sec : res ] , followed by a brief summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in spite of the simplicity of the ekman model , it will enable us to start investigating the coupling between the wind - stress and the ocean currents .",
    "the time , @xmath0 , and depth , @xmath1 , dependent equations of the ekman model @xcite , describing the dynamics of the zonal ( east - west ) @xmath2 and meridional ( south - north ) @xmath3 components of the current vector , are : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the local coriolis parameter ( @xmath6 is the duration of a day in seconds and @xmath7 is the latitude ) , and @xmath8 is the parametrized eddy viscosity coefficient , assumed to be depth - independent . in eqs . , we consider @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the bottom ocean geostrophic currents determined by the pressure gradient and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the actual surface current components . in",
    "what follows , we consider the statistics of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where the statistics of @xmath15 , @xmath14 can be obtained by a simple transformation .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen such that the current derivative , with respect to the depth coordinate @xmath1 , is proportional to the integrated current at the bottom of the layer described by our model and to the wind - stress vector @xmath16 at the surface @xcite , @xmath17 where , @xmath18 here , we introduce the following notation : @xmath19 is the depth of the upper ocean layer , @xmath20 is a proportionality constant representing the rayleigh friction @xcite , @xmath16 are the wind - stress components , and @xmath21 is the ocean water density ( hereafter assumed to be constant , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the value used for @xmath20 in the numerical calculations is based on the empirical estimate outlined in @xcite .    by integrating eqs . over a sufficiently deep layer ( i.e. , @xmath23 )",
    ", we obtain the equations describing the depth integrated currents and their coupling to the wind - stress , @xmath24 in the derivation above , we did not explicitly consider the pressure gradient .",
    "explicit inclusion of the pressure gradient would result in constant geostrophic currents , and equations describe the dynamics of the deviation from the geostrophic currents .    to allow a simpler treatment of these equations ,",
    "we define @xmath25 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath26 obeys the following equation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "[ wdyn ] is a complex langevin equation in which the complex noise is not necessarily gaussian @xcite .",
    "the formal solution of equation is @xmath29 this formal solution demonstrates that the currents depend on the history of the wind - stress , and therefore , the distribution of the currents depends , not only on the wind - stress distribution , but on all multi - time moments of the wind - stress .",
    "however , the two extreme limits are quite intuitive .",
    "when the correlation time of the wind - stress , @xmath30 , is long ( i.e. , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , one expects that the currents will be proportional to the wind - stress since the ocean has enough time to adjust to the wind and to almost reach a steady state . in terms of eq .",
    ", in this limit , @xmath33 can be approximated by @xmath34 since its correlation time is longer than the period over which the exponential kernel is non - zero . in the other limit , when the correlation time of the wind - stress is very short ( i.e. , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , namely , the wind - stress is frequently changing in a random way , the ocean is not able to gain any current magnitude . in this case",
    ", the central limit theorem @xcite implies that each component of the current vector is gaussian distributed .",
    "it is useful to write the formal expression for the square of the current s amplitude in terms of the wind - stress temporal correlation function .",
    "taking the square of eq . and averaging over all realizations ( with the same statistical properties ) of the wind stress , one obtains : @xmath37 the variance of the current s amplitude may be written as @xmath38 where we defined the temporal correlation function of the wind - stress as @xmath39 to allow analytical treatment , we proceed by considering two special idealized cases in which the formal solution takes a closed analytical form . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider the case of statistically isotropic wind - stress ( the direction of the wind - stress is uniformly distributed , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , namely a case in which the wind - stress components are independent , identically distributed variables with identical temporal autocorrelation functions .",
    "the latter assumption is not always valid ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , the generalization of our results to the case of non - isotropic wind stress is straightforward .",
    "a simple way to model the temporal correlations of the wind is by assuming that the wind vector randomly changes every time period @xmath30 while remaining constant between the `` jumps . '' by integrating the solution of @xmath26 ( eq . ) and taking into account the fact that the distribution of @xmath26 at the initial time and final time should be identical , one can obtain the expressions for the second and fourth moments ( ensemble average over many realizations of the stochastic wind - stress ) of the current amplitude . to better relate our results to the outcome of data analysis , we also need to consider the time average since the records are independent of the constant wind - stress period .",
    "the double averaged second moment of the current s amplitude is defined as @xmath40 and the angular brackets represent the average over different realizations of the wind - stress with the same statistical properties . using eq . and the fact that in this idealized case , the wind stress is constant over the period of the step ( @xmath30 ) , we obtain for the double averaged second moment of the current s amplitude ( see the supplementary material for the details of the derivation ) : @xmath41 where we have introduced the notations @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .    the two extreme limits discussed in section [ sec : model ] can be easily realized and understood .",
    "when the correlation time @xmath30 is very long compared with @xmath44 , the second moment of the current is proportional to the second moment of the wind - stress , namely , @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "this is exactly what one would expect",
    ". the long duration of constant wind - stress allows the system to fully respond and adjust to the driving force , and hence , the moments of the currents are proportional to the moments of the wind - stress . the coefficient of proportionality is given by the solution of eqs . with constant wind - stress .",
    "the other limit is when @xmath46 and , in this case , @xmath47 .    in this limit",
    ", the second moment of the current amplitude is very small and approaches zero as the correlation time approaches zero .",
    "this result is what one would expect for a rapidly changing wind that can not drive significant currents . using eq . and the fact that wind - stress is constant over the step period ( @xmath30 ) , we calculate the double averaged ( over the step period and the ensemble of wind - stress realizations ) fourth moment ( see the supplementary material for the details of the derivation ) , @xmath48 where @xmath49 . here",
    ", we again use the fact that the integrals of the time averaging are easily carried due to the fact that the wind - stress is constant during the averaged period .    while at the limit @xmath50 , both the second and the fourth moments vanish , the ratio between the fourth moment and the square of the second moment remains finite and is equal to @xmath51 .",
    "this corresponds to the rayleigh distribution which originates in the facts that the components of the currents are independent and each one has a gaussian distribution with a zero mean and the same variance .",
    "one can easily understand the origin of the gaussian distribution by considering the central limit theorem , which can be applied in this limit .",
    "each of the current components is the integral of many independent , identically distributed random variables ( the wind - stress at different times ) .",
    "based on the second and fourth moments in the limit of @xmath50 , we conjecture that the overall pdf of the ocean current speed , in this case , is given by the rayleigh distribution .    in @xcite , the case of constant wind - stress over some duration",
    "was investigated using the depth - dependent ekman model .",
    "the existence of a wind - stress duration for which the current amplitude is maximal was found .",
    "the results of this section generalize these results by considering the randomness of the wind - stress and its continuity .",
    "in addition , we consider here the empirical rayleigh friction .    in order to better understand the existence of constant wind - stress duration , @xmath30 , for which the average current amplitude is maximal , we present , in fig .",
    "[ fig:2rs ] , two typical trajectories of the current velocity components @xmath52 . the dynamics of the velocity field may be understood as follows .",
    "when the friction , @xmath20 , is smaller than the coriolis frequency , the velocity field undergoes circular motion and returns , with frequency @xmath53 , to a point in the velocity space which is very close to the initial point .",
    "the initial current is irrelevant since even a small amount of friction ensures that the initial point is close to the origin at the long - time limit .",
    "the above dynamics is valid for any value of the temporal wind - stress .",
    "therefore , if the wind - stress changes with a frequency equal to the coriolis frequency , the current amplitude can not be driven far from the origin , and its average remains small ( this explains the observed minimum for @xmath54 ) . on the other hand , when the wind - stress changes with a frequency equal to double the coriolis frequency , the current velocity reaches the largest amplitude when the wind - stress changes and the new circle starts around a different initial point ( possibly far from the origin ) .",
    "therefore , in the latter case , the average current speed is maximal .",
    "to better illustrate this picture , we present , in fig .",
    "[ fig:3rs ] , typical time series of the current velocity components and amplitude .",
    "the dots represent the times when the wind - stress changed .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath55 , the typical velocity amplitude when the wind - stress changes ( the dots in fig .",
    "[ fig:3rs ] ) , is significantly larger than the one for @xmath56 .    the intuitive explanation above relies on the fact that @xmath57 .",
    "to elucidate the role of the friction , we present , in fig .",
    "[ fig:4rs ] , the analytically calculated second moment ( eq . ) of the current versus the constant wind - stress duration for different values of @xmath20 .",
    "when the viscosity is large , there is no maximum but rather a monotonic increase of the average current amplitude as @xmath30 increases .",
    "the second case we consider is the ornstein - uhlenbeck wind - stress .",
    "this process results in a gaussian wind - stress with an exponentially decaying temporal correlation function .",
    "it is important to note that , due to the gaussian nature of the force , the first and the second moments of the wind - stress , together with its two - point correlation function , provide all the information on the driving force .",
    "the correlation function of the wind - stress components is given by @xmath58 the long - time limits of the current components averages are : @xmath59 the long - time limit of the current amplitude variance , @xmath60 , is given by @xmath61 under the assumption of isotropic wind - stress , the variance may be expressed as @xmath62 . note that in deriving the expression above , we assumed that the autocorrelation function of the wind - stress is isotropic .",
    "in general , this is not the case @xcite ; however , for simplicity , we present here the results for this special case , and the generalization to the more realistic case is trivial . due to the gaussian nature of the wind - stress and the linearity of the model , the current components have gaussian distributions that are fully characterized by the mean and variance .",
    "note that the result of eq .",
    "holds for any distribution of the wind - stress components , as long as the two - point correlation function is given by eq .",
    "equation is easily derived by substituting the two - point correlation function ( eq . ) in eq . .",
    "similar to the first idealized case discussed above , it is clear that the second moment vanishes at the limit of a short wind - stress correlation time , ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "we performed two types of numerical simulations to validate the analytical derivations presented above .",
    "the first type was a simple integration of eqs .",
    "( [ uvdyn])these numerical solutions are provided , both to validate the analytical results and to present the solutions of cases not covered by the analytical solutions . in the second type of simulation",
    ", we used a state - of - the - art oceanic gcm , the mitgcm @xcite , to test the applicability of our analytical derivations when the spatial variability of the bottom topography and the nonlinearity of the ocean dynamics @xcite are taken into account .",
    "the mitgcm solves the primitive equations @xcite and is implemented here using cartesian coordinates with a lateral resolution of 1 km ( or 10 km ) with a @xmath65 grid points .",
    "we consider open ( periodic ) and closed physical boundaries of the domain ( the results of the closed boundary setup are presented only in the last figure ) .",
    "there is one vertical level that expresses a 2d parabolic basin with a maximum depth of @xmath66 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5rs ] .",
    "the basin is situated in a plateau of @xmath67 depth .",
    "the use of the partial cell option of the mitgcm enables us to handle depth variability , even with a single vertical level .",
    "the integration time step is @xmath68 , and the overall integration time is two years .",
    "water temperature and salinity are kept constant .",
    "the horizontal viscosity is @xmath69 , and the vertical one is @xmath70 .",
    "we use the linear bottom drag option of the mitgcm , and the effective drag coefficient is depth dependent where the mean bottom drag coefficient is @xmath71 .",
    "we also use the implicit free surface scheme of the mitgcm .",
    "there are different ways to introduce heterogeneity to the water flow , for example , by forcing the water surface with spatially variable wind stress .",
    "changes in density due to changes in temperature and salinity , as a result of spatially and temporally variable surface heat and freshwater fluxes , can also enrich water dynamics .",
    "the main goal of the mitgcm numerical experiments presented here is to validate the analytical results presented above when advection and horizontal viscosity are taken into account . to enrich water dynamics",
    ", we chose to vary the water depth when including ( excluding ) the boundaries of the domain  there is no particular reason for choosing this way over another .",
    "we find the depth variability simpler , from a numerical point of view , but still rich enough to allow us to study the boundary effects on the water dynamics and to compare the numerical results with the derived analytical expressions .",
    "it is widely accepted that the pdf of ocean currents follows the weibull distribution @xcite ; therefore , we use this distribution in our numerical tests . for consistency , we provide here a brief review of its properties and the methods we used to implement temporally correlated and uncorrelated time series .",
    "the weibull pdf is defined for positive values of the variable , @xmath72 , and is characterized by two parameters , @xmath73 and @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath74 and @xmath73 are both positive . @xmath74 and @xmath73 are usually referred to as the scale and shape parameters of the distribution .",
    "the cumulative weibull distribution function is given by : @xmath76 it is possible to express the moments of the weibull distribution , @xmath77 , using @xmath73 and @xmath74 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the gamma function .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to calculate the first and second moments of a time series and , from them , to find the @xmath73 and @xmath74 that characterize the weibull distribution ( assuming that we have a priori knowledge that the series is weibull distributed ) .",
    "the @xmath73 parameter can be calculated using any two different moments ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) of the time series by solving ( numerically ) a transcendental equation @xmath82 , and @xmath74 can be estimated by using the first moment ( the mean ) and the estimated @xmath73 .",
    "it is also possible to calculate the @xmath73 parameter from the slope of the hazard function of the weibull distribution @xmath83 when a log - log plot is used . in this manuscript",
    ", we use the second and the fourth moments to derive the values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "previous studies used other approximations to estimate @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "a special case of the weibull distribution , called the rayleigh distribution , is obtained when @xmath84 .",
    "it can be associated with the distribution of the magnitude of a vector whose components are two independent , gaussian - distributed , random variables ; i.e. , if @xmath85 and @xmath86 are gaussian - distributed independent random variables , then the distribution of @xmath87 is a rayleigh distribution ( weibull distribution with @xmath84 ) .",
    "it is fairly easy to generate an uncorrelated weibull - distributed time series ( using a simple transformation rule ) .",
    "however , below we use time series that are both weibull distributed and temporally correlated .",
    "such time series are generated as follows :    a.   generate uncorrelated , gaussian - distributed , time series .",
    "b.   introduce temporal correlations by applying fourier transform to the time series from ( i ) , multiply the obtained power spectrum by the power spectrum corresponding to the desired correlations ( in our case , exponentially decaying temporal correlations ) and apply an inverse fourier transform .",
    "c.   generate uncorrelated weibull - distributed time series .",
    "d.   rank order the time series from step ( iii ) according to the time series of step ( ii ) .",
    "the resulting time series is both temporally correlated and weibull distributed .",
    "it is important to note that deviations from the desired weibull parameters and the correlation time may occur due to the finite size of the time series . in order to minimize these deviations , one must ensure that the time series are much longer than the relevant correlation time .",
    "elaborated discussion of this and similar methods may be found in @xcite . in deriving the results presented in the following section , we have used the algorithm mentioned above to generate the weibull - distributed and temporally - correlated wind stress .",
    "in addition , the parameters characterizing the weibull distribution of the currents ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) were derived using the second and fourth moments and the relations mentioned in this subsection .",
    "the analytical results presented above for the idealized cases highlight the important role played by the temporal correlations of the wind - stress in determining the statistics of surface ocean currents .",
    "the behaviors at the limits of long - range temporal correlations ( @xmath90 ) and short - range temporal correlations ( @xmath91 ) are intuitive , once derived .",
    "the existence of an optimal correlation time , at which the average current amplitude is maximal , is less trivial . a similar maximum",
    "was reported by @xcite , as described above .",
    "@xcite ( right panel of fig .",
    "11 of their paper ) studied the ekman layer rectification using the @xmath92-profile - parameterization and observed a maximum in the depth - averaged variance of the current speed as a function of the markov memory time . in",
    "what follows , we present the results of the numerical tests .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:6rs ] , we show the second moment of the current amplitude for the isotropic , step - like wind - stress model . the analytical results ( eq . ) are compared with the numerical solution of the ekman model ( eqs . ) and the mitgcm modeling of the currents in a simple artificial lake ( details of which are provided above , using open boundaries with 1  @xmath93 resolution ) .",
    "one can see that the dependence of the average current amplitude on the constant wind - stress duration is non - monotonic ( due to the fact that the coriolis effect is significant ",

    "the findings of @xcite are consistent with the lower range of @xmath99 values used here .",
