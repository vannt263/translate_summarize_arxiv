[ plot6 ] .",
    "let us recall that classically the solution of the kepler problem corresponds to a conic - section orbit whose eccentricity and perihelion depends on the energy and angular momentum .",

    ", we obtain an almost elliptical ( open ) orbit that is modified by the effect of back - reaction of quantum variables , as shown in fig .  [ orbit ] .",
    "under these conditions the effective orbit starts very close to the classical one and , as it evolves , quantum effects increasingly drive it away .",
    "+    the departure of the effective orbit from the classical one can also be understood by looking at the uncertainties in @xmath40 .",
    "these are the curves located at each side of the quantum trajectory @xmath90 , ( i.e. the brown and purple thin curves ) . in fig .",
    "[ orbitd ] . here",

    "actually , from the previous discussion we know that there is a region where the magnitude of the dispersion is comparable to that of the expectation values",
    ". then we can interpret these as the quantum effects that keep the orbit away from the classical trajectory for large times .",
    "this behavior is similar to the one in @xcite , where minimum uncertainty states were constructed in which the wave function can be described by classical equations for short times , while for longer times the wave packet that lives in the elliptical trajectory begins to spread .",
    "+    we can further appreciate the quantum evolution of the system by looking at the corresponding radial phase space diagram .",
    "classically , for a particle rotating in an elliptic orbit in configuration space , the radial phase diagram is a closed curve representing a bound state in which the particle attains a maximum and a minimum value of its radius from the force center ( dashed ( red ) curve in fig .",

    "as time evolves we see that the radius becomes increasingly smaller and the radial momentum grows .",
    "moreover , after a long enough period of time , we can see in fig .",
    "[ plot4]b that , as the radius gets localized , the radial momentum disperses : this is a direct manifestation of the uncertainty principle in phase space .",
    "+    fig .",
    "[ plot8 ] shows how the dispersions evolve and to what extent the uncertainty principle is fulfilled . from fig .",
    "[ plot8 ] we see that the inequality is satisfied for short times , during the phase where the expansion can be treated perturbatively , as mentioned above .",
    "there is only one region where the product presents a peak but then remains flat for some more time . for large times",
    "the perturbative assumption is no longer valid , as the product of uncertainties grow larger and larger .",
    "this is a similar behavior as the one presented by a radial squeezed state studied in @xcite , where the uncertainty product features a cyclic behavior . in the same way we can say that our system begins in a state with minimum uncertainty ,",
    "not squeezed , and for larger times it gets dispersed .",
    "+      even though the non - relativistic hydrogen atom has been solved exactly it was latter proved that the wkb approximation was rather poor in this case , which is usually attributed to the singular behavior of the potential at the origin @xmath92 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that wkb can be performed in @xmath93 with precise results if the centrifugal term @xmath94 is replaced by @xmath95 which in turn gives very accurate energy eigenvalues for the wkb approximation , even at lowest order .",
    "the main difference between wkb and the method presented here is the scope of the treatment : while both methods intend to establish a semiclassical approach to the quantum mechanical system at hand , the wkb aims at obtaining , by means of an series expansion on @xmath96 , the wave function and corrections to the energy levels .",
    "that is , one writes the wave function as @xcite @xmath97 and the wkb approximation consists in expanding @xmath98 in powers of @xmath96 and in neglecting in the schrdinger equation terms of order @xmath99 or higher .",
    "besides the fact that the method aims in approximating the wave function it fails in the vicinity of the _ classical _ turning points , i.e. , @xmath100 . to circumvent",
    "this one defines the _ connection _ functions in order to connect the wave functions in the regions adjacent to the turning points .",
    "evolution and description of the quantum mechanical system in our method is not based on a wave function but rather in its momentous description and their quantum back - reaction on expectation values .",
    "one can compute the energy of the system and , probably the most interesting aspect of our description , also the semiclassical evolution of observables and orbits at different regimes in the parameter space . however , one feature that both schemes ( and any approximation method in quantum mechanics ) share is the growing in time of quantum corrections that render the approach invalid as well as the oscillatory character of the evolution in our case or in the expression of wave function and energy in the wkb .",
    "this is a well known effect in quantum mechanics .",
    "the effective equations method presented here is an alternative method that in principle should reproduce all the results of standard quantum mechanics as long as one consider all the infinite moments .",
    "as mentioned , this method is quite suitable for a semi - classical analysis , defining a region where the moments can be considered as perturbations .",
    "the semi - classical states of the hydrogen atom have been explored in terms of the correspondence principle for large principal quantum number @xmath101 .",
    "in such a case a wave packet can follow a classical orbit .",
    "interestingly , given the conservation of energy and angular momentum , there are no transversal spreading in such states .",
    "the simplest of this states has a dispersion of order @xmath102 , and it evolves in such a way that the wave packet is distributed almost uniformly on a circular orbit @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of these states have both classical and quantum features : for short times the motion is classical , after that the quantum dynamics becomes dominant @xcite .",
    "something very similar happens in our case , although we do not necessarily describe the same state , as the effective equations method provides us with minimal uncertainty dynamical states .",
    "there is also a formalism to construct radial and angular coherent and squeezed states that show the main features of classical motion @xcite .",
    "semi - classical states have also been constructed from the coherent states of a 4 dimensional oscillator which is reached by the ks mapping of the 3 dimensional hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study the semi - classical states of the hydrogen atom as it has been possible to find them experimentally in the laboratory through the excitation of the outermost electrons of certain atoms , with ultrashort laser pulses @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been obtained experimentally new localized wave packets in very large @xmath101 states that travel in nearly circular orbits @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here provides an alternative tool for the study of some different semi - classical states of the hydrogen atom that had not been considered before , indeed we can see that our states are not of minimum uncertainty for all times .",
    "this is even clearer if we consider the ratio @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ dratio ] .",
    "one can see that there is a group of peaks indicating that at those times the uncertainty in @xmath40 increases as uncertainty in @xmath79 decreases , while in the flat regions the opposite occurs . as in fig .",
    "[ plot8 ] we can compare this with the behavior of the radial squeezed state @xcite , where this ratio starts with a large amplitude and then damped oscillates until it reaches a minimum although continues oscillating , showing the squeezing in @xmath79 . clearly our state is not a squeezed one , but is the closest one that begins satisfying uncertainty relations .    .",
    "the peaks indicate that there is more spread in the radius than in the momentum at that time , i.e. states are squeezed for short periods.,width=249 ]",
    "in this work we have obtained an effective description of the hydrogen atom by means of a momentous formulation of quantum mechanics . we were able to obtain a semiclassical picture of the evolution of the classical dynamical variables by studying their equations of motion , back reacted by quantum dispersions and spreadings .",
    "this is done in regions where the moments can be considered as perturbations , which also allows us to make a consistent truncation of the equations of motion .",
    "the equations of motion for expectation values are obtained from an effective hamiltonian that acquires quantum corrections represented by spreadings to all orders .",
    "we have seen that the system reduces to the kepler problem when one sets all the quantum fluctuations to zero .",
    "the case of zero angular orbital momentum , @xmath69 , that classically corresponds to a one dimensional system , gets so strongly quantum corrected that it effectively corresponds to a two dimensional system .",
    "this behavior has no classical analogous , and in this way is a similar effect as the quantum tunneling phenomena .",
    "the evolution of the system is controlled by generalizations of the heisenberg uncertainty relations among quantum variables that are satisfied during the perturbative period , thus providing us with a consistent analysis and evolution .    as we pointed out",
    "we were able to determine the evolution of expectation values of variables which enabled us to determine an effective orbit for the electron , which is close to the classical elliptical orbit for short initial times . for larger times",
    "it is diverted to an open quasi - elliptical orbit as shown in figs .",
    "[ orbit ] , [ orbitd ] and [ plot4 ] .",
    "one can see from these figures how quantum effects modify the classical behavior , realizing that , as the system evolves , there is a switching between the radial and momentum spreadings .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the behavior of the orbits and the spreadings shown in fig .",
    "[ orbitd ] , although not identical , are similar to those reported in the literature where the wave packets follow elliptical orbits for a while and then spread .",
    "although this method gives a semi - classical behavior in a well - defined region , the states that we use are not the minimum uncertainty states that are usually called coherent states for the hydrogen atom , or the rydberg - type states similar to those that have been experimentally produced through ultra - short laser pulses .",
    "our states are new states describing the semiclassical behavior of the hydrogen atom .",
    "thus we emphasize the qualitative features of this analysis , the method of effective equations and its robustness in obtaining new states suited to describe the semiclassical behavior .    even though we were able to solve numerically the equations of motion , and with this obtaining the evolution of the system providing a rather interesting description , it is still needed to obtain a set of physical initial conditions that will allow us to compare quantitatively our results with experimental or theoretical data in a consistent manner . due to the very complicated nature of the dynamical system and the infinite number of quantum variables",
    "this task is yet under further study .    due to the complexity of the effective variables and their equations of motion we restricted ourselves to the two dimensional case , corresponding to the classical version , and",
    "then it is necessary to explore the three dimensional system . given the results obtained in the one dimensional case , where quantum effects induce a two dimensional behavior , we could obtain modifications to the two dimensional motion due to quantum back - reaction by considering the remaining angular variable and its associated momenta , fixed in the present analysis . in such case",
    "the corresponding results should be more accurate and closer to those currently reported in the literature and experimentally .",
    "the implications and possible applications of our analysis to other systems and phenomena are promising . for instance",
    ", the implementation of this method to hydrogen - like atoms and systems should be straightforward and may result in a more detailed description and a deeper understanding of those systems .",
    "note that , even for the helium atom ( a system with two electrons ) , there is no exact solution , and any study of this system is performed at an approximation level , being ours one that could led to a more refined and precise description .",
    "this work was supported by grant conacyt cb-2008 - 01/101774 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , as one considers higher order moments the average number of terms in the equations increases exponentially .",
    "here we show the system of effective evolution equations up to third order , that corresponds to thirty coupled equations @xmath104 -\\frac{4}{r^{5}}g^{3,0,0,0}\\left [ \\frac{l^2}{m}\\frac{5}{r } - k    \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\     - \\frac{6}{mr^{4}}\\left(l g^{1,0,0,1 } + \\frac{1}{2}g^{1,0,0,2}\\right ) + \\frac{12\\,l}{mr^5}g^{2,0,0,1},\\\\    \\fl \\dot{\\theta } = \\frac{l}{mr^2 } - \\frac{2}{mr^3}g^{1,0,0,1 } +      \\frac{3}{mr^{4}}\\left(lg^{2,0,0,0 } + g^{2,0,0,1 } \\right ) - \\frac{4l}{mr^{5}}g^{3,0,0,0 } , \\\\",
