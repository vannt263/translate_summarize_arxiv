    "the effective potential in quantum field theory plays a crucial role in connection with the problem of the spontaneous symmetry breaking . in this field",
    "there are three classic papers @xcite .",
    "coleman and weinberg@xcite were the first ones to calculate the higher - order effective potential of a scalar field at one loop level by summing up an infinite number of feynman graphs .",
    "jackiw@xcite has used the feynman path - integral method to obtain a simple formula for the effective potential .",
    "he has succeeded in representing each loop order containing an infinite set of conventional feynman graphs by finite number of graphs using this algebraic method which can formally be extended to the arbitrary higher - loop order . in ref .",
    "@xcite the functional integral is explicitly evaluated using the steepest descent method at two - loop level .",
    "higher - loop calculations with this method are very difficult .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that there is a missing portion in the two - loop effective potential of the massless @xmath0 @xmath2 theory obtained by jackiw @xcite . in this paper",
    "we employ the dimensional regularization method @xcite instead of the cutoff regularization method used in ref .",
    "@xcite and for the sake of brevity we confine ourselves to the case of single component theory ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the lagrangian for a theory of a self - interacting spinless field @xmath4 is given as ( ( x))&=&1+z2_^ -m^2+m^22 ^ 2-+4!^4 , [ lg ] where the quantities @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the renormalized field , the renormalized mass , and the renormalized coupling constant respectively , whereas @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are corresponding ( infinite ) counterterm constants .",

[ slg ] the feynman rules for this shifted lagrangian are given in fig .  1 .    without introducing any new loop - expansion parameter , which is eventually set to be unity , we will use @xmath18 as a loop - counting parameter @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why we have kept all the traces of @xmath18 s in the feynman rules above in spite of our employment of the usual `` god - given '' units , @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to the above feynman rules , fig .  1 , which are used in constructing two- and higher - loop vacuum diagrams , we need another rule ( fig .",
    "2 ) solely for a one - loop vacuum diagram which is dealt with separately in jackiw s derivation of his prescription and is essentially the same as that of coleman and weinberg @xcite from the outset .    using the rules , fig .  1 and fig .  2 , and including the terms of zero - loop order",
    ", we arrive at the formal expression of the effective potential up to two - loop order : v_eff()&=&+ + + .[onn ] the last three ( bracketed- ) terms on the right - hand side in the above equation appear in fig .  3 .    for the purposes of renormalization",

    "we will use the following notation for the effective potential up to the @xmath20-loop order : v_eff^[l]()=_i=0^l ^i v_eff^(i ) ( ) . the zero - loop part of the effective potential is given as v_eff^(0)()=4!^4 .",

    "one may put @xmath26 ( and @xmath28 below ) to be zero from the beginning because the theory is massless . in our dimensional regularization scheme the pole part of @xmath24 vanishes , but this is not the case in the cutoff regularization method .",
