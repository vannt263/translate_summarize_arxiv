    "there is an abundance of references , and apart from the references in the books in the bibliography , the review paper by damanik , pushnitski and simon @xcite contains many references .",
    "the appendix discusses the spectral theorem , and references are given there .",
    "all measures discussed are borel measures on the real line , and we denote the @xmath1-algebra of borel sets on @xmath2 by @xmath3 . furthermore , @xmath4 .",
    "all the results in these notes have appeared in the literature .",
    "spectral decompositions of self - adjoint operators on hilbert spaces can at least be traced back to the work of fredholm on the solutions of integral equations .",
    "the study of sturm - liouville differential operators was a great impetus for the development of spectral analysis , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "for some explicit sturm - liouville type differential operators there is a link to well - known special functions , such as e.g. jacobi polynomials , which shows the close connection between special functions and spectral theory . at the moment , this is for instance an important ingredient in the study of so - called exceptional orthogonal polynomials , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "spectral theory is , loosely speaking , essentially a study of the eigenvalues , or spectral data , of a suitable operator , and to determine such an operator completely in terms of its eigenvalues . for a self - adjoint matrix",
    "this means that we look for its eigenvalues , which are real in this case , and the corresponding eigenspaces , which are orthogonal in this case .",
    "so we can write the self - adjoint matrix as a sum of multiplication and projection operators , and this is the most basic form of the spectral theorem for self - adjoint operators .",
    "we recall the spectral theorem in its most general form in appendix [ app : spectralthm ] .",
    "the application to differential operators , and also to various developments in physics , such as quantum mechanics , is still very important . through this application",
    ", there have been many developments for special functions .",
    "one of the classical applications is to study the second order differential operator @xmath5 on the weighted @xmath6 space for the weight @xmath7 on @xmath8 $ ] for a suitable normalisation constant @xmath9 . then @xmath10 can be understood as an unbounded self - adjoint operator with compact resolvent .",
    "the spectral measure is then given by projections on the orthonormal jacobi polynomials , which are eigenfunctions of @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the differential operator can also be studied on @xmath11 with respect to a suitable weight , and then its spectral decomposition leads to the jacobi - function transform , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "xiii ) , @xcite and references .",
    "another classical application of spectral analysis is a proof of favard s theorem , see corollary [ cor : favardsthm ] , stating that polynomials satisfying a suitable three - term recurrence relation , are orthogonal polynomials .",
    "this follows from studying a so - called jacobi operator on the hilbert space @xmath12 of square summable sequences .",
    "the spectral analysis of such a jacobi operator is closely related to the moment problem , and this link can be found at several places in the literature such as e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the haussdorf moment problem , i.e. on a finite interval , played an important role in the development of functional analysis , notably the development of functionals and related theorems , see @xcite .",
    "one particular application is to have other explicit operators , e.g. differential operators or difference operators , realised as jacobi operators and next use this connection to obtain results for these explicit operators . in section [ sec : jmatrixmethod ]",
    "we give a couple of examples , including the original ( as far as we are aware ) motivating example of the schrdinger operator with morse potential due to the chemist broad , see references in section [ ssec : schrodingermorsepotential ] .        as is well - known the askey scheme of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials and its @xmath0-analogue , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and initially observed by askey in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) , see also the first askey - scheme in labelle @xcite drawn by hand , consists of those polynomials which are also eigenfunctions to a second - order operator , which can be a differential operator , a difference operator or a @xmath0-difference operator of some kind",
    ". see figures [ fig : askeyscheme ] and [ fig : qaskeyscheme ] , taken from koekoek , lesky , swarttouw @xcite for the current state of affairs .",
    "naturally , many of these operators , like the differential operator for the jacobi polynomials , have been studied in detail .",
    "this is in particular valid for the operators occurring in the askey - scheme . for the other operators , especially the difference operators for the orthogonal polynomials in the @xmath0-analogue of the askey scheme corresponding to indeterminate moment problems ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is natural to extend the ( @xmath0-)askey - scheme to include also integral transforms with kernels in terms of ( basic ) hypergeometric series , such as the hankel , jacobi , wilson transform , and its @xmath0-analogues and to study these transforms and their properties from a spectral analytic point of view using the associated operators .",
    "we refer to the schemes ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.1 , 1.2 ) remarking that in the meantime ( * ? ?",
    "1.1 ) has been vastly extended to include the wilson function transform by groenevelt @xcite , and various transformations that can be obtained as limiting cases . in the terminology of grnbaum and coworkers , all the instances of the ( @xmath0-)askey - scheme are examples of the bispectral property .",
    "this means that the polynomials are eigenfunctions to a three - term recurrence operators ( acting in the degree ) and at the same time are eigenfunctions of a suitable second order differential or difference operator in the variable .",
    "in particular , all these instances give rise to bispectral families of special functions .    motivated by one of the second order @xmath0-difference operators arising in the @xmath0-analogue of the askey - scheme , we discuss the spectral analysis of three - term recurrence operators on @xmath13 in section [ sec : threetermz ] .",
    "we apply the spectral theorem to a particular example and we obtain a set of orthogonality measures for the continuous @xmath14-hermite polynomials . here",
    "we follow the convention @xmath15 , so that @xmath16 .",
    "these measures turn out to be n - extremal , where n stands for nevanlinna .",

    "we make also use of previous lecture series by berg @xcite and durn and lpez - rodrguez @xcite , but also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in section [ sec : jmatrixmethod ]",
    "we show how realisations of explicit operators , such as differential operators , as recurrence operators can be used to study the spectral theory .",
    "this gives rise to relations between the spectral decomposition of such an operator and the related orthogonal polynomials . in the physics literature such a method",
    "is known as the @xmath18-matrix method , and there is a vast literature of physics applications , see e.g. references to work of al - haidari , bahlouli , bender , dunne , yamani and others in @xcite .",
    "the first example of section [ sec : jmatrixmethod ] is the study of the schrdinger operator with a morse potential , originally due to broad @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the second example of section [ sec : jmatrixmethod ] is in the same vein , and due to ismail and the author @xcite .",

    "we then discuss an example of such a case , extending the second example of section [ sec : jmatrixmethod ] .",
    "we apply this approach to an explicit second order differential operator .",
    "the same realisation of suitable operators as tridiagonal operators has useful implications in e.g. representation theory , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the case of representation theory of the lie algebra @xmath20 and its quantum group analogue . using explicit realisations of representations",

    "there are many other references available in the literature , and apart from the books and the references mentioned there mentioned in the bibliography , one can especially consult the references in @xcite , where a list of more than 200 references can be found .",
    "in particular , there are many papers available that generalise known results in the general theory of orthogonal polynomials to the matrix - valued orthogonal polynomial case , and we refer to the references to work by berg , cantero , castro , durn , geronimo , grnbaum , de la iglesia , lopz - rodrguez , marcelln , pacharoni , tirao , van assche , etc . to the references in @xcite .",
    "let us note that in these notes the emphasis is on explicit operators related to explicit sets of special functions , so that information on these special functions is obtained from the spectral analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "there are also many results on the spectral analysis of more general classes of operators . for this subject",
    "one can consult simon s book @xcite and the extensive list of references given there .",
    "it may happen that a differential or difference operator with suitable eigenfunctions in terms of well - known special functions can not be suitably realised as a three - term recurrence operator on a hilbert space such as @xmath13 or @xmath12 .",
    "it can then be very useful to look for a larger hilbert space , and an extension of the operator to the larger hilbert space .",
    "this is different from the extension of a hilbert space in order to find self - adjoint extensions .",
    "then one needs to find a way of obtaining the extended hilbert space and the extension of the operator .",
    "this is usually governed by the interpretation of these operators and special functions in a different context , like e.g. representation theory .",
    "examples are in e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this leads to extensions of the askey and @xmath0-askey scheme of figures [ fig : askeyscheme ] , [ fig : qaskeyscheme ] with non - polynomial function transforms arising as the spectral decomposition of suitable differential and difference operators on hilbert spaces of functions , see e.g. figures 1.1 and 1.2 in @xcite .",
