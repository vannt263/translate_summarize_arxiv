    "there is the strong indication for existence of the liquid - gas critical point in ionic liquids like molten nacl . the main model for such systems",
    "is called primitive model or its restricted version where the characteristics ( mass , diameter etc . ) of the opposite charges are the same . because of formation of associated ionic pairs the derivation of mean field equation of state in rigorous thermodynamic approach is yet unsolved .",
    "the existence of additional constraints , so called sum rules @xcite , makes the problem of finding thermodynamically consistent mean field theory hard to solve comparing with the molecular liquid case .",
    "the various approaches have been proposed recently for the derivation of equation of state ( eos ) for the rpm .",
    "mostly they are based either on the improvements of classical debye - hckel ( dh ) @xcite and bjerrum @xcite theory of association or mean spherical approximation ( msa ) @xcite taking into account the association and various effective interactions . for the reviews of the results",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the location of the critical point for rpm varies in dependence of the interactions included into free energy .",
    "it is accepted that the following dimensionless parameters for the temperature @xmath0 , particle number density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 are used : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ionic diameter @xmath5 is the absolute value of the charge .",
    "the characteristic value for @xmath6 takes the values in the interval @xmath7 .",
    "the situation with the critical density @xmath8 is less definite .",
    "its value varies from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted that most of the analytical results predict low density ( @xmath11 ) and `` high temperature '' ( @xmath12 ) critical point .",
    "it can not be excluded that such low value for @xmath13 is connected with small association taken into account with the help of thermodynamic perturbation theory .",
    "however the reliability of such type estimates is not quite clear .",
    "therefore the development of the alternative approach grounded on the dipole fluid model seem to be expedient .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation studies @xcite performed in recent years give `` high density '' @xmath14 and low temperature @xmath15 critical point .    in the present paper",
    "we estimate the critical characteristics of the ionic molten in the framework of the dipole fluid approach .",
    "we will also show that the change of molecular parameters due to rotations influences essentially the location of the critical point .",
    "nacl is the simplest example of ionic liquid . in solid state",
    "it is ionic crystal . above the melting point",
    "the positions of ions become unfixed , but this liquid remains strongly dissociated .",
    "due to thermal expansion at increasing temperature the dissociation degree diminishes and the molten salt passes to a dipole liquid . at further increasing temperature and decreasing the molten density the dissociation degree grows again and the molten salt becomes completely ionized system .",
    "thus , at some temperature @xmath16 and density @xmath17 intervals the molten nacl can be considered as a dipole liquid .",
    "further the additional arguments for this assumption will be given .",
    "let us consider the general properties of this liquid and , in particular , its main critical parameters : the critical temperature and density .",
    "the interparticle interaction in dipole system takes the form : @xmath18 where the first term describes the van - der - waals interaction between molecules and @xmath19 the proper dipole - dipole interaction , @xmath20 is the interparticle spacing .",
    "note that the dipole moment of a pair is some function of the equilibrium distance between ions in a pair : @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath23 is dielectric permittivity .    because of the dipole - dipole interactions are relatively weak the angular distribution of dipole moments @xmath24 is close to isotropic one .",
    "more exactly we assume that the two particle distribution function @xmath25 can be approximated by the first two terms in the expansion : @xmath26 the approximation of such a kind allows us to exclude the orientational degrees of freedom in the configurational integral with the help of the perturbation theory .",
    "in fact this procedure is equivalent to the usage of the isotropic potential @xmath27 here @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the diameters of ions na and cl correspondingly and for simplicity we put @xmath31 and neglect the difference in masses of the ions , @xmath32 denotes the average with internal partition function of a pair .",
    "it is easy to check that the inequality @xmath33 takes place at all @xmath34 .",
    "therefore further the contribution @xmath35 will be ignored .",
    "it is essential , that the averaging procedure restricts the applicability region of the potential ( [ dip ] ) by interparticle spacings @xmath36 which gives the size of the `` averaged '' dipole of order @xmath37 . though the value of @xmath38 may be slightly less than @xmath39 since rotating dipoles are not the same as hard spheres of diameter @xmath37 .",
    "it is quite clear in view of scattering cross section for the hard rotating dumbells . at this level @xmath38",
    "should be considered as the parameter ( in general temperature dependent ) of the dipole - dipole potential .",
    "the procedure of its fixing in the critical point will be discussed further .    to describe the properties of the molten nacl within the interval , where it can be considered as a dipole liquid",
    ", we can use the potential with hard wall :    @xmath40    such a potential leads to the van - der - waals equation of state @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the pair number density .",
    "therefore the overall density is @xmath44 . in dimensionless form",
    "( [ vdw ] ) and ( [ a ] ) read as : @xmath45 and @xmath46 here all spatial parameters is given in units of @xmath4 .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath47 depends on the internal structure of the pair .",
    "though by the order of magnitude @xmath48 , nevertheless from @xcite it follows that the characteristic values of dipole moments correspond to @xmath49 .    since @xmath38 is connected with the size of the pair we model its temperature dependence via relation : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the fitting parameter .",
    "note that @xmath38 is temperature dependent which we assume the same as that for @xmath52 .",
    "the functions @xmath53 will be determined below .",
    "note that the vapor phase contacting with the liquid one is the gas of dipole molecules .",
    "the van der waals eos is appropriate approximation for eos for such vapor phase .",
    "thus we can get the the critical parameters of this system using the van der waals theory of the critical point .",
    "the equation ( [ vdw ] ) leads to the following equations for the critical temperature and density ( note that @xmath54 , where @xmath1 is the total number density ) : @xmath55 the estimates for these parameters are straightforward if we put @xmath56 , and take into account that due to small dipole moment of nacl @xmath57 ( in units of @xmath4 ) : @xmath58 @xmath59 which are in satisfactory agreement with the values @xmath60 @xmath61 obtained within extended debye - hckel - bjerrum theory @xcite augmented with ion - dipole interaction .",
    "our value of the critical density is greater due to the neglecting the dissociation of the dipole pairs .",
    "now we need to consider the dipole pair as itself since the parameters of the potential ( [ ddp ] ) actually are the averages over the internal partition function of a pair and therefore are the temperature dependent functions .",
    "in previous section the model of undissociated ionic liquid consisting of rotating dipoles has been introduced . here",
    "we investigate the internal structure of the bound pair of ions .",
    "we take into account the fact that the energy of interaction of a pair should include centrifugal energy together with coulombic potential as in standard problem of two bodies interacting via central field .",
    "the dissociation temperature for nacl - molten is determined by the effective potential of an ion within a rotating dipole which includes the centrifugal energy : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the moment of inertia of the charge with reduced mass @xmath64 . at such high temperatures",
    "all degrees of freedom are all in equilibrium and we can use the estimate @xmath65 note that the equilibrium distance between ions in a pair , which is determined by the minimum of effective potential ( [ rrf ] ) with the help of ( [ rotat ] ) , is @xmath66 which is exactly the bjerrum size of the pair @xmath67 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . the choice of ( [ bjer ] ) as the size of the ionic pair is inappropriate from the physical point of view at low temperatures @xmath68 @xcite . it is natural that with lowering @xmath0 the size of a pair should become smaller tending to @xmath4 at @xmath69 .",
    "that is why it was suggested to use it for @xmath70 only .",
    "let us consider this question within the picture formulated above",
    ". to be more correct we will include the rotational energy into association constant , which is proportional to the internal partition function of the pair @xcite : @xmath71 in 2d case one can put @xmath72 because of the logarithmic growth of the electrostatic potential and get the estimation of kosterlitz - thouless temperature of dissociation @xcite . in 3d case",
    "there is the problem with upper cutoff in such an approach where the association constant is identified with internal partition function of the ionic pair .    to define the size of a pair following bjerrum we investigate the extremal points of the integrand in ( [ as ] )",
    "doing so we get two solutions : @xmath73 where @xmath74 here @xmath75 is solution of the bjerrum type ( minimum of the integrand in ( [ as ] ) ) , which as has been said above is inappropriate .",
    "@xmath76 is another solution corresponding to the maximum of the integrand , which has quite reasonable values and correct behavior at low @xmath77 .",
    "it is easy to check that asymptotically for low values of the temperature @xmath77 the value of @xmath78 is formed mainly by the maximum of the integrand .",
    "in addition the appropriate limiting behavior to the hard - core contact at formal limit @xmath79 is hold provided that @xmath80 . this value of @xmath81 is in full accordance with the virial theorem @xcite .",
    "all these facts confirms that we can treat the quantity @xmath76 as the size of the pair even at `` high '' temperatures @xmath82 .",
    "in addition @xmath76 never exceeds @xmath83",
    ", i.e. the interparticle the distance when the influence of other pairs and charges on the effective potential can be neglected ( see fig .  [ r1 ] ) .    .",
    "]    so we put @xmath76 as the physical cutoff for ( [ as ] ) .",
    "the existence of such length scale was noted in @xcite basing on the the numerical analysis of the function @xmath84 , though only coulomb potential was included in boltzmann factor .",
    "it gives the rate at which @xmath85 rises very rapidly to its plateau value . in our case",
    "we find the same behavior of @xmath85 at small temperatures , @xmath86 ( see fig .",
    "[ plateu ] ) .     as a function of @xmath51 and @xmath87 . ]",
    "finally we see that there is the natural temperature interval for dipole fluid which is bounded from above by the temperature @xmath88 therefore for @xmath89 the dipole is stable as itself . note that the existence of the temperature ( [ tbj ] ) reminds kosterlitz - thouless transition in 2d case . in particular , the centrifugal energy introduced above plays the role analogous to the chemical potential _",
    "`` ... required to create a pair of particles of equal and opposite charge at a distance @xmath90 apart ... '' _ in kosterlitz - thouless model @xcite . however ,",
    "in contrast to 2d case in 3d case there is no any divergence in the size of the pair and therefore in its polarizability , but its derivative on the temperature has singular behavior . in other words the temperature derivative of the polarizability is singular but not the polarizability itself .",
    "this inference might seem as mere an artifact of introducing the upper cut off in ( [ as ] ) .",
    "but it should be noted that taking dielectric permittivity @xmath23 as the order parameter , which is directly connected with polarizability , we get exactly the divergence of its temperature derivative even in mean field approximation .",
    "this may serve as additional support for the conjecture of intensive breaking of the dipole pairs at the critical point observed in some numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "the existence of the interaction between dipoles and the free charges provides additional instability mechanism for their dissociation thus reducing the temperature of `` ideal '' dissociation ( [ tbj ] ) because of the polarization of the dipole in the external field of dipole - dipole potential ( [ ddp ] ) and coulombic field of free charges . the consideration given above states that there are two characteristic transition in the dipole - dipole fluid : 1 ) `` dipole liquid - dipole gas '' critical point of van der waals type ; 2 ) the smeared dissociation `` transition '' from associated state to almost completely dissociated one .",
    "this smeared transition can be characterized by the temperature on the binodal at which the degree of dissociation is 1/2 .",
    "the interaction between translational degrees of freedom of the ions is characterized by the critical temperature of the liquid - gas transition , while internal , rotational degrees of freedom are involved into dissociation of such dipole fluid .",
    "these degrees of freedom will strongly interact if the corresponding potentials will be of the same magnitude i.e. @xmath91 .",
    "the additional confirmation of coincidence of such transitions is the high degree of dissociation above the critical point observed in numerical experiments @xcite and theoretical models @xcite , which incorporate dielectric permittivity resulting from the existence of the dipole pairs .",
    "this means that @xmath92 can not be less than @xmath93 .",
    "all said above means that in such situation we can not rely on ( [ vdw ] ) since appropriate eos should incorporate all relevant interactions which lead to phase separation .",
    "in particular the critical temperature is sensitive to the temperature dependence of the parameter @xmath94 .",
    "the condition for the dissociation of a pair in external electrostatic field is : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the dipole moment , which consists of proper and induced dipole moments .",
    "obviously , @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the polarizability of a pair .",
    "the averaging over the thermal equilibrium gives : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the dielectric susceptibility of the medium and @xmath101 is the characteristic volume .",
    "it is connected with the polarizability of the cavity . according to the definition :",
    "@xmath102 so we get the equation for the temperature in dimensionless form : @xmath103 within the proposed approach we put @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the radius of first coordination sphere .",
    "this is the minimal volume for which the conception of continuity of the medium can be applied . by the order of magnitude @xmath106 .",
    "the solution of ( [ t ] ) gives the dependence @xmath107 . in order to fix the value of @xmath51 in the critical point which determine the size of the pair we should equate @xmath107 and @xmath108 obtained above",
    "this way we get : @xmath109 which are close to those obtained above ( [ critest ] ) . in notations of @xcite , @xmath110 . in this work",
    "the estimate for the parameter @xmath111 from simple geometric considerations was given : @xmath112 .",
    "thus our estimate is in this interval . from the results obtained above",
    "we can infer that the dipole fluid of rotating dipoles in the vicinity of its liquid - gas critical point is about to dissociate .",
    "sure our consideration is incomplete since it does not take into account the existence of free charges .",
    "finally we estimate the ginzburg number by the formula used for the molecular liquids @xcite : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the interparticle spacing within ionic pair and @xmath115 is the amplitude of the correlation length for density fluctuations . since the density fluctuations are connected with the ones for dipole pairs we put it to be equal @xmath116 . using the parameters of the critical point found in ( [ c1 ] ) we get the estimate : @xmath117",
    "the ionic and dipole liquids form two natural approximations to describe the critical properties of the systems similar the molten nacl . in our paper",
    "we have estimated the main critical parameters for liquid with hard dipole as well as consider the influence of the effects arising due to softness of a dipole molecule . in particular",
    "the last is very important to describe the dielectric properties of a system near the critical point .",
    "besides , the variation of molecule parameters due to the rotations allows us to determine the equilibrium size of a ionic pair .",
    "it is not excluded that the quantum corrections to internal states of the dipole pairs will also slightly change the estimates .",
    "in particular the temperature dependence of the vibrational contributions to the heat capacity can also be studied .",
    "the following step is to construct the equation of state for small `` soft '' dipole molecules and to take into account the dissociation process with the help of perturbation theory .",
    "the combination of such an approach with that developed in @xcite on the basis of ionic liquid allows to narrow the region of the most probable values for the critical parameters .",
    "our estimate for the critical temperature correlates with the known analytical results .",
    "note that most of the analytical approaches based on eos for low density coulombic system ( dh , msa etc . ) where the dissociation is taken into account perturbatively .    within the dipole liquid approach we have obtained the estimate for the ginzburg temperature and have shown that it less than one for the simple liquid by a factor @xmath118 .",
    "the approximation of the dipole liquid allows us to analyze in the evident form the contribution of the polarizational effects @xcite .",
    "one can show that the lasts lead to the further considerable decrease of the ginzburg temperature .",
    "note also the possibility for the appearance of new inhomogeneous phase near the critical point of ionic liquids .",
    "since the dissociation temperature @xmath92 is near @xmath93 , the system can desintegrate on the regions with the essentially different values of the ionization degree @xmath119 : the drops of ionic and dipole liquids . as a consequence the region with the ising - like behavior",
    "can not be reached .",
    "this scenario needs in very careful investigation .",
    "these and other questions will be the subjects of further works ."
