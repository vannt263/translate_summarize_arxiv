    "indeed , the simplest example , known as the enriques calabi  yau threefold , has been one of the most tractable compact calabi  yau threefolds ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "the objective of this paper is to investigate calabi ",
    "yau threefolds of type k with a view toward self - mirror symmetry .    here is a brief summary of the paper .",

    "yau threefold of type k and @xmath6 its minimal splitting covering , with a k3 surface @xmath7 and an elliptic curve @xmath8 .",
    "the geometry of @xmath0 is equivalent to the @xmath9-equivariant geometry of the covering space @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the galois group of the covering @xmath12 .",

    ", we obtain several results on the yukawa couplings ( theorem [ yukawa ] ) and special lagrangian fibrations ( propositions [ slag ] & [ slag2 ] ) parallel to what is known for borcea  voisin threefolds ( voisin @xcite and gross ",

    "voisin threefolds has a different flavour from that for the complete intersection calabi ",
    "yau threefolds in toric varieties and homogeneous spaces , and hence it has been a very important source of examples beyond the batyrev  borisov toric mirror symmetry .",
    "we hope that our work provides new examples of interesting mirror symmetry .",
    "we also investigate brauer groups , which are believed to play an important role in mirror symmetry but have not been much explored in the literature ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "an importance of the brauer group @xmath22 of a calabi ",

    "it is also interesting to observe that @xmath28 holds in our case .",
    "the role of the brauer group in mirror symmetry is tantalising , and deserves further explorations .",
