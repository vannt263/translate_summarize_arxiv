    "quantum teleportation , first suggested by bennett _",
    "_ bennett93 , is one of the cornerstones of quantum information and computation @xcite .",
    "the crucial ingredient characterizing this phenomenon is the transfer of information between noninteracting systems at the expense of a quantum channel .",
    "this issue has received great attention since its pioneer proposal , mainly after its experimental realizations from 1997 onwards bouwmeester97,boschi98,experiments , experiments2,experiments3 . in the meantime , various proposals have been suggested for implementing teleportation , for instance , teleportation of trapped wave fields inside high - q microwave cavities davidovich94,cirac94,almeida00,pires04,yang06,cardoso08 , teleportation of running wave fields @xcite , teleportation of trapped field states inside a single bimodal cavity iara07 , nonprobabilistic teleportation of a field state via cavity qed @xcite , and teleportation of the angular spectrum of a single - photon field @xcite , among others .    since the pioneering work by bennet _",
    "@xcite , several schemes for teleportation differing from this original protocol ( op ) have appeared in the literature .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors show how to partially teleport an entanglement of zero and one photon state in the running wave domain . by partial teleportation ( pt )",
    "it is mean that teleportation will occur by changing one of the partners of the entangled state to be teleported .",
    "pt can be detailed , step by step , in the following sequence : i ) particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 are previously prepared in the state that we want to teleport ; ii ) an entangled state of particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 is created ; iii ) a joint measurement on particles @xmath1 and @xmath2 is accomplished such that particles @xmath0 and @xmath4 assumes the previous entangled state from particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that the term pt is also used in literature to deal with teleportation of an unknown state with the generation of its clone @xcite .",
    "other interesting protocol is the so called entanglement swapping zukowskiprl93,bosepra98,lupla00 . in a standard entanglement swapping , there are usually three spatially separate users : alice , bob , and charlie .",
    "alice and bob share pairs of entangled particles with charlie .",
    "initially , the particles with alice and bob are not entangled .",
    "then , charlie makes a bell - state measurement on his two particles , leading to the entanglement of the two particles with alice and bob .    in this paper",
    "we present a scheme for partial teleportation in the cavity qed domain using entanglement swapping in only one particle , as is done in ref .",
    "our scheme uses four two - level atoms interacting either on or off resonantly with a single mode of a high - q cavity , ramsey zones , and selective atomic state detectors . to estimate losses occurring during the partial teleportation process",
    ", we used the phenomenological operator approach technique ( poa ) @xcite .",
    "we assume atom @xmath5 previously entangled with atom @xmath6 in the following state , which is the state we want to teleport @xmath7where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are unknown coefficients obeying @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the atomic ground ( excited ) state .",
    "the state ( [ in ] ) can be prepared , for instance , by the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where two two - level atoms interact simultaneously with a single mode of a cavity - field .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the atom - field interaction , in the interaction picture , is @xmath13 when the atom - field interaction is resonant , and @xmath14 when the atom - field interaction is off - resonant .",
    "this condition is valid provided that @xmath15 @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean photon number and @xmath18 is the damping rate for the cavity - field . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the creation and annihilation operators for the cavity field mode , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the raising and lowering operators for the atom , @xmath23 is the atom - field coupling constant , and @xmath24 is the detuning between the cavity field frequency @xmath25 and the atomic frequency @xmath26 .    to compose the nonlocal channel ,",
    "a third atom ( initially prepared in the excited state @xmath27 ) interacts resonantly with the cavity field mode @xmath0 ( in vacuum state @xmath28 ) , according to eq .",
    "( [ hon ] ) ( see fig .",
    "1a ) . adjusting the atom - field interaction time to @xmath29",
    ", the nonlocal channel will be given by@xmath30at this point , alice has the atom @xmath5 and the cavity , while atoms @xmath6 and @xmath31 are sent to bob .",
    "the state of the whole system composed by the two - level atoms and the cavity mode field is @xmath32 ,   \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\]]where , for convenience , we have defined the bell states @xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xmath35@xmath36    as in the op , the teleportation is completed after alice measuring on particle @xmath5 and cavity @xmath0 and sending her result to bob , whom will know which unitary operation to accomplish on its particles in order to recover the entangled state that alice wanted to teleport .",
    "note , however , that different from the op , when comparing the teleported state resulting from eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) with the state to be teleported , eq . ( [ in ] ) , we see that partner @xmath5 was replaced by particle @xmath31 .",

    "after the inclusion of the decay via poa , the state of the whole system by the time the teleportation is concluded becomes a mixture , being represented by a reduced operator density when the reservoir is traced out . in our estimative , we take the case of the teleported state in bob hands when alice measures the bell state @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) . the corresponding fidelity is shown in fig .",
    "note that at the time the teleportation is completed ( @xmath90 ) the fidelity rounds @xmath5 , indicating that we can safely neglect losses occurring during the teleportation process .",
    "in fact , taking @xmath93 , as reported in @xcite , we will have @xmath94 , which is the necessary time for the atom @xmath5 to interact dispersively with the cavity field and to cross the ramsey zone , @xmath95 , which is the necessary time for the atom - field resonant interaction , and @xmath96 , which is much shorter than the atomic decay @xmath97 , being the fidelity at this time @xmath98 as can be seen from fig .

    "therefore , the effective time during which the teleported state is at our disposal for further operations is @xmath101 @xmath102 .    .",
    "in this section we show that the fluctuation effect in the interaction time due to the uncertainty in the atomic speed is not relevant as compared to the decay effects of the teleported state presented in section above .",
    "first , we consider the impossibility of sharply fixing the atom - field interaction time .",
    "the method adopted here is the same presented in ref .",
    "we introduce the probability density @xmath103 , where @xmath84 is the true duration of the interaction between the atom @xmath83 ( @xmath104 ) and the cavity .",
