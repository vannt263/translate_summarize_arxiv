    "prior to the work of meyer  @xcite , the kochen - specker theorem @xcite ( ks theorem ) was generally regarded as one of the key foundational results of quantum mechanics , establishing one of the most important ways in which quantum mechanics enforces a radical departure from the assumptions of classical physics .",
    "classically , a measurement is a process which reveals the pre - existing value of the observable measured . until recently it was generally accepted that the ks theorem shows that quantum mechanics can not be interpreted in such a way as to preserve this feature of classical physics .",
    "unfortunately , the ks theorem , as originally formulated , only applies to ideal , or von neumann measurement processes . in practice , strict ideality is seldom , and perhaps never actually attainable .",
    "it follows that the ks theorem , in its original form , is not sufficient to demonstrate a contradiction between classical assumptions and the empirically verifiable predictions of quantum mechanics , regarding the outcome of real , laboratory measurements .    at first sight , this may not seem a serious problem .",
    "the natural assumption would be that the original ks theorem is a limiting case of a more general theorem , which does apply to non - ideal measurements .",
    "we will eventually argue that this is , in fact , the correct assumption .",
    "however , the question is greatly complicated by the work of meyer  @xcite , kent  @xcite and clifton and kent  @xcite ( mkc in the sequel ) , who have argued that `` finite precision measurement nullifies the kochen - specker theorem '' .",
    "mkc s claimed `` nullification '' of the ks theorem has given rise to some controversy .",
    "it has been discussed by ( in chronological order ) cabello  @xcite , havlicek _ et al _",
    "@xcite , mermin  @xcite , appleby@xcite , simon _ _ et al__@xcite , larsson  @xcite , simon  @xcite , cabello  @xcite and boyle and schafir  @xcite . for further discussion of the problem of demonstrating an empirical contradiction with the predictions of non - contextual hidden variables theories",

    "@xcite and cereceda  @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted that mkc s argument was inspired by the previous work of pitowsky  @xcite , hales and straus  @xcite and godsil and zaks  @xcite ( we briefly comment on pitowsky s work in the conclusion ) .",
    "the arguments in this paper are largely new .",
    "they go significantly beyond any that have previously been given .",
    "we begin by nullifying mkc s claimed nullification .",
    "that is , we show that mkc s ingenious mathematical constructions , though deeply interesting in their own right , do not invalidate the essential physical point of the ks theorem .",
    "having cleared the conceptual ground , we then go on to establish a generalized version of the ks theorem , which does apply to non - ideal measurements . in order to make the treatment comprehensive",
    "we conclude by discussing a number of related questions .",
    "in particular , we discuss a recent claim by cabello  @xcite , that the mkc models do not reproduce the empirically verifiable predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "our main criticism of mkc s argument is contained in sections  [ sec : whatobs][sec : nullfurther ] .",
    "section  [ sec : whatobs ] contains some preliminary considerations .",
    "mkc assume that an experimenter can never precisely know what has `` actually '' been measured .",
    "this assumption plays an important role in their argument because it enables them to postulate that it is physically impossible to measure each of the observables in a ks - uncolourable set .",
    "we show that the assumption depends on some misconceptions regarding non - ideal quantum measurements .",
    "section  [ sec : extendks1 ] contains the crux of the critical part of our argument .",
    "the physical point of the ks theorem is to show that quantum measurements can not generally be interpreted as measurements in the classical sense .",
    "a classical measurement is not simply a process which reveals a pre - existing value .",
    "rather , it is a process which reveals a pre - existing piece of classical _ information _ , represented by a proposition of the form `` observable @xmath0 took value @xmath1 '' . for this condition to be satisfied",
    "it is essential that the value @xmath1 and observable @xmath0 _ both _ be adequately specified .",
    "it appears to mkc that their models nullify the ks theorem because , in their models , a measurement does always reveal the value of _",
    "something_. however , it does not reveal the precise identity of that something .",
    "since the mkc valuations are radically discontinuous this means that measurements do not generally reveal any classical information .",
    "consequently , they can not generally be regarded as measurements in the classical sense .",
    "it follows that the ks theorem is not nullified .",
    "section  [ sec : nullfurther ] contains some supplementary considerations , which reinforce the conclusion reached in section  [ sec : extendks1 ] .",
    "the argument just outlined goes beyond the arguments given in our previous papers because it shows that mkc s claim , to have nullified the ks theorem , is simply false . in appleby  @xcite",
    "we showed that the mkc models are highly non - classical .",
    "in fact , we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the mkc models exhibit a novel kind of contextuality , which is even more strikingly at variance with classical assumptions than the usual kind of contextuality , featuring in the ks theorem .",
    "consequently , the argument in ref .",
    "@xcite is , by itself , sufficient to refute mkc s suggestion , that their models provide a classical explanation of non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the argument in ref .",
    "@xcite , though less clear - cut , lends additional support to this conclusion .",
    "however , neither argument directly bears on mkc s claim , to have nullified the ks theorem as such . indeed , at the time we wrote these papers it appeared to us that mkc actually had `` nullified the ks theorem _",
    "strictly so - called _ '' ( as we put it ) .",
    "it is important to establish that finite precision does unequivocally _ not _ nullify the ks theorem because , in the absence of such a demonstration , it is impossible to achieve an unobstructed understanding of contextuality , as it applies in a real , laboratory setting .",
    "the question has immediate , practical relevance , in view of the current interest in experimental investigations of contexuality  @xcite .    having cleared the conceptual ground in sections  [ sec : whatobs][sec : nullfurther ] we go on , in section  [ sec : extendks2 ] , to formulate and prove a generalized ks theorem , applying to non - ideal measurements .",
    "the argument in this section is inspired by the argument of simon  _ et al _",
    "@xcite and larsson  @xcite ( sbzl in the sequel ) . however , there are some important differences .",
    "sbzl work with an `` operational '' concept of contextuality .",
    "their motive for introducing this concept is to circumvent mkc s argument .",
    "clearly , the motive no longer applies , once it is established that mkc s argument is invalid .",
    "we are consequently able to formulate a generalized ks theorem in terms of the ordinary concept of contextuality .",
    "this has several advantages .",
    "in the first place it means that the result we prove is a _ straightforward _ generalization of the ordinary ks theorem . in the second place",
    ", there is a loophole in sbzl s argument , which means that their result is actually incorrect .",
    "as we show in appendix  [ ap : zeilinger ] , by means of a counter - example , _ operational _ non - contextuality is _ not _ inconsistent with the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "the modified argument we give in section  [ sec : extendks2 ] resolves this difficulty .",
    "lastly , the result we prove implies a significantly different conclusion , as to the conditions which must be satisfied in order refute non - contextual theories experimentally .",
    "sections  [ sec : whatobs][sec : extendks2 ] contain the main part of our argument . in sections  [ sec :",
    "povm][sec : empequiv ] we address a number of related questions .    in section  [ sec : povm ]",
    "we briefly discuss the povm arguments given by kent  @xcite and clifton and kent  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : seq ] we give an improved version of the argument in appleby  @xcite . in the first place",
    "we have improved the argument so as to take account of the points made in section  [ sec : whatobs ] of this paper . in the second place ,",
    "the version we give now does not involve joint measurements of non - commuting observables . in the third place ,",
    "we have strengthened the argument , using ideas derived from the subsequent work of sbzl .    in section  [ sec : empequiv ] we discuss the question , whether there actually exists a _",
    "complete _ theory of mkc type which is empirically equivalent to quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , we discuss a recent claim by cabello  @xcite , that theories of this type make experimentally testable predictions which conflict with those of quantum mechanics .",
    "we argue that , although cabello makes some very pertinent points , the question remains open .",
    "mkc s argument partly depends on a misconception , regarding non - ideal quantum measurements .",
    "we begin our critical discussion by clarifiying this point .",
    "the criticisms which follow are preliminary to our main critical argument , contained in the next section .",
    "mkc postulate that there are many observables which it is physically impossible to measure .",
    "if an experimenter attempts to measure an observable @xmath2 in this forbidden set , then what is _ actually _ measured is a slightly different observable @xmath3 .",
    "the measurement reveals the pre - existing value of the observable @xmath3 which is _ actually _ measured .",
    "it can be seen from this that mkc tacitly assume :    for a given finite precision measuring apparatus there is a single , uniquely defined observable , which is the only observable that is `` actually '' measured .",
    "the nominal observable , which is recorded in the experimenter s notebook as having been measured , is typically not the observable which is `` actually '' measured .",
    "we will show that these assumptions are unjustified .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us clarify the meaning of the term `` nominal observable '' , as it appears in the above statement .",
    "the term essentially corresponds to simon _",
    "s  @xcite `` switch position '' . however , unlike simon _",
    "et al _ we are not appealing to the concept of an `` operational observable '' ( _ i.e. _  the concept that different instruments define different observables  see appendix  [ ap : zeilinger ] ) .",
    "we are simply recognizing the fact that the complete record of a measurement ( quantum or classical ) must include , not only a specification of the value obtained , but also a specification of the observable measured .",
    "suppose , for instance , that an experimenter makes 1,000 different measurements of 1,000 different observables .",
    "if the experimenter simply writes down a list of 1,000 numbers , without any indication as to how those numbers were obtained , then the record will obviously be useless ( this point , that the outcome of a measurement [ quantum or classical ] is , not simply a _ value _ , but a determinate _ proposition _",
    ", will play a central role in the argument of the next section ) .",
    "it should be stressed that , although we refer , for convenience , to the actions of a human experimenter , the same point would apply if the measurements were performed by a completely arbitrary `` information gathering and utilizing system ''  @xcite .",
    "if the system is to utilize the information it acquires then it must record , in its memory area , a specification of the observables measured , as well as the values obtained .",
    "the nominal observable need not be specified precisely .",
    "rather than recording the information `` observable @xmath4 was measured and value @xmath5 obtained '' , one might instead record the information `` observable @xmath6 was measured , for @xmath7 , and value @xmath5 obtained '' ( where @xmath8 is some subset of the unit 2-sphere ) . in the following we will assume that the nominal observable is specified precisely , because this is legitimate , and because it happens to be the usual practice .",
    "however , the argument could easily be modified so as to allow for the possibility that the nominal observable is only specified partially .",
    "let us now consider mkc s assumption that , for each quantum measurement , there is one , and only one observable which is `` actually '' measured . the fact that this assumption is unjustified becomes apparent when one takes into view ( as mkc do not ) the detailed physical implementation of an abstract quantum measurement scheme .",
    "consider , for example , a non - ideal measurement of the spin component @xmath9 using a stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "the vector @xmath10 is determined by the axis of symmetry of the arrangement .",
    "mkc take it that , in such a case , although the axis is not precisely known to the experimenter , there does actually exist a single , sharply defined axis of symmetry ; and that there correspondingly exists a single , sharply defined spin component @xmath9 which is the _ only _ spin component that is actually measured",
    ". however , this is to overlook the fact that the magnetic field will not , in practice , be perfectly symmetric ( due to irregularities in the shape of the pole - pieces , asymmetries in the placement of surrounding objects , _ etc . _ ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sterngerlach ] the numerous slight departures from perfect symmetry introduce some unavoidable `` fuzziness '' into the concept `` axis of symmetry of the field '' . under these conditions",
    "there is no _ single _",
    "vector @xmath10 which represents the axis of symmetry more truly than any other . this being so , there are no obvious grounds for picking out any single spin component as the only component which is `` actually '' measured .",
    "a measurement  @xcite of @xmath11 is a process which discriminates the eigenstates of @xmath11 .",
    "given an unknown eigenstate of @xmath6 , an ideal measuring instrument will inform the experimenter , with _ certainty _ , which particular eigenstate it was .",
    "a non - ideal measuring instrument will inform the experimenter , with _ high probability _ , which particular eigenstate it was .",
    "this is the definition of a quantum measurement process  @xcite : if a process performs the function , of discriminating the eigenstates of an operator , then it is a measurement of that operator , ideal or non - ideal as the case may be .    of course , it is seldom , if ever the case that a real laboratory instrument is strictly ideal , and the stern - gerlach arrangement is no exception to this rule .",
    "it is important , furthermore , to note that , not only does a stern - gerlach arrangement fail to perform an ideal measurement of the nominal spin component , which is recorded in the experimenter s notebook as having been measured ; it fails to perform an ideal measurement of any other spin component either ( for a discussion of the unavoidable sources of non - ideality in stern - gerlach measurements see busch _ et al _",
    "the arrangement may , however , be used to perform _ non - ideal _ measurements ( which is the most that can reasonably be demanded of a real , laboratory instrument ) .",
    "we can characterize the degree of non - ideality in quantitative terms by considering the probability that the process will fail to correctly identify a given eigenstate .",
    "suppose that the arrangement is used to measure the component @xmath6 for a spin-@xmath12 particle .",
    "let @xmath13 ( respectively @xmath14 ) be the probability that , when the system particle is initially in the spin up ( respectively spin - down ) eigenstate of @xmath6 the measurement outcome is @xmath15 ( respectively @xmath5 ) .",
    "then it may be said that , the smaller these probabilities are , the more nearly ideal  @xcite the measurement .",
    "there is no vector @xmath10 for which @xmath16 ( see busch _",
    "there are , however , vectors @xmath10 for which the failure probabilities @xmath13 , @xmath14 are both small . if @xmath10 satisfies this condition the arrangement can be used to discriminate the eigenstates of @xmath6 with a high degree of reliability . in other words",
    ", it can be used to perform non - ideal measurements of @xmath17 .",
    "the failure probabilities @xmath13 , @xmath14 vary continuously with @xmath10 .",
    "this means that , if the probabilities are small for one vector @xmath10 , then they will also be small for every other vector which is close to @xmath10 .",
    "it follows that , for a given arrangement , there are infinitely many different spin components which are _ all _ non - ideally measured .",
    "furthermore the class of observables which are non - ideally measured includes the nominal observable ( provided it is correctly recorded , and provided the instrument does not malfunction ) .",
    "we began our discussion of the stern - gerlach arrangement by noting that , in practice , the arrangement will not have a sharply defined axis of symmetry .",
    "it can now be seen that , even if the symmetry were exact , mkc s assumption , that there is only one observable that is `` actually '' measured , would still not be justified .",
    "it is true that there might ( perhaps ) then be a well - defined , natural sense in which the measurement of @xmath6 was `` most nearly ideal '' when @xmath10 was parallel to the axis of symmetry .",
    "but it would not follow that a neighbouring component @xmath18 , defined by a vector @xmath19 which was not exactly parallel to the axis of symmetry , was not `` actually '' measured _ at all_.    a process does not have to be precisely optimal in order to count as a measurement . if the probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 become slightly larger , then that simply means that the process does not discriminate eigenstates quite so efficiently as before .",
    "it does not mean that the process thereby ceases to _ be _ a measurement .",
    "the real photon detectors which have been constructed to date are imperfect , in that there is a non - zero probability that the detector will fail to register the presence of a photon .",
    "this does not mean that a real photon detector does not `` actually '' detect photons at all .",
    "furthermore , a photon detector whose performance becomes slightly degraded , so that it is no longer quite so efficient as before , does not , on that account , cease to _ be _ a photon detector .    in general , however , there is no unambiguous , non - arbitrary , physically well - motivated way to define the concept `` unique spin component for which the measurement is most nearly ideal '' .",
    "for instance , minimizing the function @xmath20 , and minimizing the function @xmath21 leads to definitions of this concept which are , in general , incompatible ( quite apart from the fact that the minima may not be unique ) . in the general case",
    "there are _ many _ spin components which all have an equally valid claim to the status `` spin component for which the measurement is most nearly ideal '' .",
    "thus far we have been considering the case of the stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "however , it is shown in appendix  [ ap : nonideal ] that the above criticisms apply much more generally , to the case of any approximate von neumann measurement ( _ i.e. _  any non - ideal measurement described by a unitary operator which is close to a unitary operator describing a von neumann measurement ) .",
    "this provides strong grounds for the assertion that properties  1 and  2 assumed by mkc should be replaced by    for a given finite precision measuring apparatus there are infinitely many different observables which are non - ideally measured .",
    "the nominal observable is among the observables which are non - ideally measured ( provided the nominal observable is recorded correctly , and provided there is no malfunction in the measuring apparatus ) .",
    "it may be worth remarking that these statements are also valid classically .",
    "consider , for example a classical measurement of the velocity component @xmath22 of some macroscopic object , using the doppler shift of the radiation it emits . in order to perform this measurement",
    "it is necessary that the line running from source to detector should be parallel to the @xmath23-axis .",
    "the fact that source and detector are both extended objects , which are not perfectly symmetric , means that , in practice , this line is not even precisely _ defined _ , let alone precisely _",
    "known_. however , this does not imply that @xmath22 may not be the component which is `` actually '' measured .",
    "rather , it is to be regarded as one of the sources of error in the measurement of @xmath22 .",
    "a classical measurement of a classical observable @xmath0 is a process which reveals , with a high degree of reliability , and to a high degree of accuracy , the pre - existing value of @xmath0 . on this definition",
    "the procedure described effects a non - ideal classical measurement of @xmath24 for every @xmath10 which is nearly ( but perhaps not precisely ) parallel to the @xmath23-axis .    the effect of the argument in this section is to restore the natural assumption of most physicists , that the observable which an experimenter records as having been non - ideally measured is also measured in fact ( provided the experimenter does not make a mistake , and provided there is no malfunction in the measuring apparatus ) .",
    "let us now consider the bearing which this has on mkc s argument .",
    "our criticisms do not invalidate mkc s postulate , that a measurement of @xmath2 may reveal the value of some other , neighbouring observable @xmath3 .",
    "they do , however , show that mkc can not justifiably claim that @xmath3 is the only observable which is `` actually '' measured , and that @xmath2 is not really measured at all .",
    "mkc can not even claim that @xmath3 is the uniquely defined observable for which the measurement is most nearly ideal .",
    "in general , the observable @xmath3 has _ no _ preferred status .",
    "properly understood , mkc s postulate comes to this : that the hidden dynamics somehow selects an essentially _ arbitrary _ observable @xmath25 , whose value it then reveals .",
    "the point is important because , once mkc s proposal is formulated correctly , it becomes easier to see the fallacy in their argument .",
    "this section contains the main part of our critical argument .",
    "the ks theorem shows    no hidden variables interpretation can have the property that , for every observable @xmath2 , an _",
    "ideal _ measurement of @xmath2 always reveals the pre - existing value of @xmath2 .",
    "mkc s claim , when appropriately re - formulated , so as to remove any unjustified appeal to the concept of `` the unique observable which is actually measured '' , is that this proposition is `` nullified '' by    there do exist hidden variables interpretations with the property that , for every observable @xmath2 , a _ finite precision _ measurement of @xmath2 always reveals the pre - existing value of some unknown observable @xmath3 in a small neighbourhood of @xmath2 .    in considering this claim",
    "the first problem we face is that the term `` nullified '' is not part of the standard lexicon of science and mathematics , and so its meaning is potentially ambiguous .",
    "propositions  1 and  2 are logically consistent , so there can be no question of the ks theorem actually being refuted .",
    "it is not immediately apparent what , exactly , is meant by the claim that proposition  2 `` nullifies '' proposition  1 , without contradicting it .    in this connection",
    "it should be noted that the reference to finite precision measurements , on which mkc themselves place much emphasis , is actually irrelevant .",
    "mkc postulate that , for each non - ideal measuring apparatus , the hidden dynamics somehow arbitrarily selects an observable @xmath3 , close to the nominal observable , whose value the measurement then reveals .",
    "one could , with equal justification , postulate that the same is true for each _ ideal _ measuring apparatus : implying    there do exist hidden variables interpretations with the property that , for every observable @xmath2 , an _",
    "ideal _ measurement of @xmath2 always reveals the pre - existing value of some unknown observable @xmath3 in a small neighbourhood of @xmath2 .",
    "if the ks theorem is nullified by proposition  2 , then it must , presumably , also be nullifed by proposition  @xmath26 .",
    "it would seem to follow that such nullification as there might be can not be attributed specifically to the finite precision .",
    "in the following we will take the claim to be that the mkc models invalidate what had previously been regarded as the key physical implication of the ks theorem : namely , the implication that quantum measurements can not systematically be interpreted as measurements in the classical sense . in the mkc models a measurement does not always reveal the value of the nominal observable .",
    "it does , however , always reveal the value of an observable which is extremely close to the nominal observable .",
    "mkc assume that is enough to recover the classical concept of measurement .",
    "the question we now have to decide is whether mkc are correct to assume that a process which does not reveal the pre - existing value of the nominal observable may still count as a measurement in the classical sense .",
    "we will argue that they are not .",
    "the crucial point to realize is that a classical measurement is not _ simply _ a process which reveals a pre - existing value .",
    "rather , it is a process which reveals a pre - existing piece of classical information , represented by a proposition of the form `` observable @xmath0 took value @xmath1 '' . for this to be true",
    "it is essential that the observable @xmath0 and the value @xmath1 both be adequately specified .",
    "a process which reveals the value of some _ completely unknown _ observable does not reveal any classical information , and is not a classical measurement .",
    "the following example may serve to illustrate this point .",
    "suppose that an experimenter is given a sealed box , containing 100 individually labelled rods .",
    "suppose that , for each integer @xmath27 the box contains exactly one rod of length @xmath28 .",
    "suppose that the experimenter , without looking inside the box , uses a random number generator to select a particular integer @xmath29 .",
    "it could be said that this procedure reveals the length of one of the rods in the box .",
    "however , it does not reveal the identity of that rod .",
    "consequently , the process does not reveal any classical information , and so it can not be considered a classical measurement .",
    "it may , at first sight , seem that these remarks do not apply to the situation envisaged by mkc since , in their models , the observable @xmath3 , whose value is revealed by the measurement , is not completely unknown .",
    "in fact , it is assumed that @xmath3 is extremely close to the nominal observable @xmath2 : so there is a sense in which @xmath3 is specified very precisely .",
    "however , it is not specified precisely _",
    "enough_.    the point here is that the mkc valuations are radically discontinuous .",
    "if the valuation could be assumed continuous in the vicinity of @xmath2 , then a process which revealed the value of some neighbouring observable @xmath3 could be regarded as a measurement in the classical sense .",
    "however , there is in fact always a region on which the valuation is highly discontinuous , and so this assumption would not generally be justified .",
    "consider , for example , the colourings of the unit 2-sphere @xmath30 discussed by meyer  @xcite ( and described in more detail by havlicek _",
    "et al _  @xcite ) .",
    "these colourings have the property that , given any @xmath31 , every neighbourhood of @xmath32 contains infinitely many points evaluating to 0 , and infinitely many points evaluating to 1 .",
    "suppose , now , that one performs a finite precision measurement of the nominal observable @xmath33 and obtains ( say ) the value 1 .",
    "then one knows that , there is a point @xmath19 in some small neighbourhood @xmath8 of @xmath10 which evaluates to 1 .",
    "however , @xmath8 contains infinitely many points evaluating to 1 , and infinitely many points evaluating to 0 .",
    "the process does not reveal any more information , as to which particular point takes which particular value , than could be obtained by tossing a coin .",
    "consequently , it can not be considered a classical measurement .",
    "it is not a classical measurement for the same reason that random number generators can not be used to make classical measurements of length .",
    "essentially the same criticism applies to an arbitrary model of mkc type . in the general case the highly discontinuous behaviour just discussed",
    "may not occur everywhere , on the whole of @xmath30 .",
    "however , there will always be a non - empty open subset of @xmath30 on which such behaviour occurs .",
    "the detailed proof of this statement is given in appendix  [ ap : colour ] . we will confine ourselves here to summarising the main points .",
    "consider an arbitrary mkc colouring @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is any dense , ks - colourable subset of the unit 2-sphere @xmath30 having the property that the set of triads contained in @xmath35 is dense in the space of all triads ( mkc assume that @xmath35 is also countable ; however the argument which follows does not depend on this assumption ) .",
    "we define the discontinuity region @xmath36 to consist of those points @xmath31 with the property that each neighbourhood of @xmath10 contains infinitely many points evaluating to 0 , and infinitely many points evaluating to 1 ( it is _ not _ assumed that @xmath10 itself @xmath37 ) .",
    "we define the continuity region @xmath38 to consist of those points @xmath39 with the property that @xmath40 is continuous on @xmath41 , for some neighbourhood @xmath8 of @xmath10 . in the case of the meyer colourings @xmath42 and @xmath43 . however , this is not true generally .",
    "it is readily verified that these regions partition @xmath30 ( the _ complete _ unit 2-sphere , not just @xmath44 ) into two disjoint subsets : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is also readily verified that @xmath47 is open and @xmath48 is closed .",
    "the key result , proved in appendix  [ ap : colour ] , is that @xmath47 is not only open , but also ks - colourable .",
    "furthermore , the ks - colouring @xmath40 defined on @xmath49 uniquely extends to a continuous , induced ks - colouring @xmath50 .",
    "we show in appendix  [ ap : colour ] that this result places significant constraints on the minimum size of the discontinuity region . in the first place , @xmath48 must have non - empty interior ( _ i.e. _  it must contain a non - empty open subset  implying that it can not simply consist of a set of isolated points or lines ) . in the second place , there is a fixed , model - independent , non - zero lower bound on the solid angle subtended by @xmath48 .",
    "let us now consider the bearing of these results on mkc s claim , to have `` nullified '' the ks - theorem . the argument we gave above ( in connection with the meyer colourings ) shows that the @xmath40-value assigned to a specific point @xmath51 can not be ascertained by any quantum measurement and is , in this sense , inaccessible . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath40-value assigned to a specific point @xmath52 can be ascertained by a quantum measurement , and so it is accessible ( provided the observable whose value is revealed is sufficiently close to the nominal observable ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the same is also true of the @xmath53-value assigned to a specific point @xmath54 ( where @xmath53 is the induced ks - colouring defined above ) .    from an empirical point of view",
    "it is not the @xmath40-values defined on @xmath55 which are significant , but the @xmath53-values defined on @xmath47 .",
    "it is only when @xmath56 that a quantum measurement of @xmath33 can be interpreted as a measurement in the classical sense , which reveals the corresponding @xmath53-value ( provided the observable whose value is revealed is sufficiently close to the nominal observable ) .",
    "the fact that there exist non - empty , ks - colourable open subsets of @xmath30 is trivial ( consider , for example , the cone @xmath57 ) .",
    "there is no sense in which this fact can validly be said to nullify the ks theorem .    in conclusion",
    ", it can be seen that the finely calculated approach of mkc , where one marks in individual points using a pencil , gets no nearer to `` nullifying '' the ks theorem than does a cruder approach , where one paints in whole open regions using a brush .",
    "it can also be seen that a would - be nullifier gets no nearer to his / her goal by postulating that a measurement reveals the value of an observable which is typically not the nominal observable .",
    "this section contains some supplementary considerations .",
    "its purpose is to reinforce the point made in the last section that , for a model to nullify the ks theorem , rather more is required than the bare fact , that a measurement always reveals the pre - existing value of _",
    "if the ks theorem could be nullified in the manner that mkc propose , then one could achieve that end more straightforwardly , without appealing to mkc s sophisticated set - theoretic constructions , by means of one of the following , much less sophisticated models .",
    "since it is a hidden variables theory that is in question , ockham s razor does not apply , and so we are free to multiply hypothetical entities at will .",
    "let us accordingly postulate that , corresponding to each observable @xmath58 of the conventional theory , there exist two beables @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "each beable is assigned the value 0 or 1 .",
    "we postulate that these values fluctuate randomly , and independently , but in such a way that , for each @xmath10 , at every time , exactly one of the beables @xmath59 , @xmath60 is assigned the value 0 , and exactly one is assigned the value 1 . in every other",
    "respect the model coincides with conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "we are thus assuming that the values taken by the beables have no causal influence on the outcome of a measurement  or , for that matter , on anything else .",
    "their function is simply to exist .",
    "we will refer to this as model  1 .",
    "it is trivially true that , in model  1 , the effect of measuring @xmath58 is to reveal the pre - existing value of one of the two quantities @xmath61 or @xmath60 .",
    "this is to be compared with the situation in the mkc models , where the effect is to reveal the value of one out of an infinite set of vectors contained in some small neighbourhood of @xmath10 .",
    "it would consequently seem that , if one is to accept that the mkc models nullify the ks theorem , then one must accept that model  1 nullifies it equally well .",
    "of course , it is intuitively evident that the ks theorem is not really nullified by model  1 .",
    "however , it is worth examining the reason for this .",
    "model  1 does not nullify the ks theorem because , even though the measurement reveals a pre - existing value , the experimenter does not learn anything thereby .",
    "the experimenter already knows , before the measurement , just from the way the model is defined , that exactly one of the two quantities @xmath61 or @xmath60 takes the value 0 .",
    "the experimenter does not know more after the measurement .",
    "the procedure can not be used to acquire additional knowledge concerning @xmath61 , @xmath60 and so it is not , in the classical sense , a measurement of these quantities . in short , model",
    "1 does not nullify the ks theorem for essentially the same reason that the mkc models do not nullify it .",
    "it is also illuminating to consider the following , slightly different model , which we will refer to as model  2 .",
    "model  2 is the same as model  1 , except that the quantities @xmath61 , @xmath60 are not assumed to fluctuate .",
    "instead , it is postulated that , for each @xmath10 , @xmath61 always takes the value 0 , and @xmath60 always takes the value 1 .    in model  2 a measurement of @xmath62",
    "not only reveals the pre - existing value of @xmath61 or @xmath60 : the experimenter even knows which of the two quantities took this value .",
    "nevertheless , there is still no nullification .",
    "suppose that an experimenter measures @xmath62 and obtains the value 0 .",
    "then , on the assumptions of model  2 , the experimenter knows that @xmath63 took the value 0 .",
    "however , the experimenter knew this already , before carrying out the measurement .",
    "the procedure has not conveyed any _ additional _ information , regarding @xmath63 , and",
    "so it is not , in the classical sense , a measurement of @xmath61 .",
    "the triviality of the constructions makes it evident that models  1 and  2 do not really nullify the ks theorem .",
    "however , the underlying fallacy is essentially the same as the fallacy underlying the much more sophisticated arguments of mkc .",
    "the only difference is that , in the case of the mkc models , partly because the constructions are so much more sophisticated , the fallacy is less obvious .",
    "in sections  [ sec : whatobs][sec : nullfurther ] we established the negative result : that finite precision does not `` nullify '' the ks theorem .",
    "the purpose of this section is to establish the positive result : that the ks theorem has a natural generalization , applying to the non - ideal measurements which might actually be performed , in the laboratory .",
    "the original version of the ks theorem shows    no hidden variables interpretation can have the property that , for every observable @xmath2 , an _",
    "ideal _ measurement of @xmath2 _ always _ reveals the pre - existing value of @xmath2 .",
    "meaning that ideal quantum measurements can not systematically be interpreted as ideal classical measurements , of the same observables .",
    "the generalized version of the ks theorem shows    no hidden variables interpretation can have the property that , for every observable @xmath2 , a _ near - ideal _ measurement of @xmath2 always has a _ high probability _ of revealing a _ good approximation _ to the pre - existing value of @xmath2 .",
    "meaning that near - ideal quantum measurements can not systematically be interpreted as near - ideal classical measurements , of the same observables .",
    "proposition  @xmath64 is a qualitative statement , since the terms `` near - ideal '' , `` high probability '' and `` good approximation '' are not sharply defined . in the following",

    "proposition  @xmath64 does not _ only _ exclude the possibility of interpreting quantum measurements as _ ideal _ classical measurements .",
    "this is important , since there would otherwise be no conflict with classical assumptions .",

    "however , we do not use their `` operational '' definition of contextuality .",

    "furthermore , there is a loophole in sbzl s argument , which means that the result stated by them is actually invalid ( _ operational _ non - contextuality is _ not _ inconsistent with the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics ) .",
    "lastly , the result we prove implies a significantly different conclusion , as to the conditions which must be satisfied in order to refute non - contextual theories experimentally . for further discussion of sbzl s approach",

    "we are here assuming that it is physically possible to ( non - ideally ) measure _ every _ triad @xmath70contrary to what is postulated by mkc .",
    "the justification for this assumption is that , if it is physically possible to ( non - ideally ) measure _ one _ triad , then it follows from rotational invariance , together with the argument in section  [ sec : whatobs ] and appendix  [ ap : nonideal ] of this paper , that it is physically possible to ( non - ideally ) measure every other triad .",

    "a reader who is so inclined may skip to the next section without loss of continuity .",

    "kent and clifton take the view that to each distinct povm there corresponds a distinct generalized observable .",
    "a generalized observable , in effect , simply is a povm .",
    "kent and clifton consider that a non - contextual theory of generalized observables would be one in which generalized measurements reveal the pre - existing truth values of the corresponding povms .",
    "their argument to show that such theories exist is similar to the argument which , they claim , nullifies the ordinary ks theorem .",
    "the objection to it is also similar .",
    "let @xmath112 be the set of all positive operators .",
    "kent and clifton postulate that the povm which is _ actually _ measured is always contained in a certain dense subset @xmath113 , which is colourable in a generalized sense . if @xmath110 is the povm that is _ actually _ measured , then the outcome will be the unique index @xmath114 for which @xmath115 evaluates to `` true '' .",
    "the objection to this argument is essentially the point we have already made , in sections  [ sec : extendks1 ] and  [ sec : nullfurther ] .",

    "let us note , parenthetically , that it may be questioned whether the concept of a generalized observable is appropriate in the case of povms which arise in this way , as part of the mathematical description of non - ideal measurements of conventional observables  @xcite .",
    "clifton and kent consider that , in the case of the measurement process described by eq .",

    "consequently , clifton and kent s povm argument , when specialized to non - ideal measurements of conventional observables , establishes the following : there exist models in which the effect of non - ideally measuring an observable @xmath127 is to reveal the pre - existing truth values of some unknown povm @xmath128 and  [ sec : nullfurther ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the predictions of the mkc models regarding sequential measurements , using three separate analyzers .",

    "it also raises the question , whether the mkc models are capable of reproducing the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics  as discussed in the next section .    the argument which follows is an improved version of an argument given in appleby  @xcite . in the first place",
    "we have improved the argument so as to take account of the points made in section  [ sec : whatobs ] of this paper . in the second place ,",

    "he fails to allow for the fact , which we proved in section  [ sec : extendks1 ] and appendix  [ ap : colour ] , that the mkc valuations are radically discontinuous .",
    "this means that a knowledge of the value of @xmath155 does not , in general , convey any information at all regarding the value of @xmath154 , no matter how small the difference @xmath158 .",
    "if @xmath159 then it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ckstatthm ] ) that @xmath160 for all @xmath75 .",
    "however , this does _ not _ imply @xmath161 , as assumed by cabello .",
    "cabello s argument can , in fact , be turned around , to disprove the assumption on which it depends .",
    "it follows from clifton and kent s statistical theorem that the conclusion to cabello s lemma  3 is false .",

    "he has similarly proved that there are cases for which there is a non - negligible probability of two nearly orthogonal projectors both evaluating to 1 .",
    "of course , in a genuinely non - contextual theory , there _ would _ be a high probability of @xmath155 having the same value as @xmath154 , if @xmath158 is sufficiently small .",
    "the fact that the mkc models do not have this property means that they are not non - contextual  as we showed in section  [ sec : extendks1 ] .",
    "however , cabello s argument is not directed at mkc s claim , that their models are non - contextual .",
    "it is directed , instead , at mkc s claim , that their models reproduce the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "there is no evident contradiction between this latter claim and the fact that the valuations in their models are highly discontinuous .",
    "it should , however , be stressed that , although it has not been proved that there does not exist a complete theory of mkc type which is empirically equivalent to quantum mechanics , the contrary proposition has not been proved either .",

    "furthermore , although cabello fails to establish his main contention , some of his intermediate results are of considerable interest .",
    "it is possible that further investigation along these lines would show that cabello s contention is , after all , correct .",
    "however , it appears to us that such a programme is unlikely to succeed unless it is directed at one of the points of weakness indicated above , rather than at clifton and kent s statistical theorem ( which seems to have been rigorously proved ) .",
    "a substantial part of this paper has been devoted to a criticism of mkc .",
    "we ought to stress , by way of conclusion , that we actually consider that they have made a very important contribution to this subject .",
    "we have argued that mkc s claim , that their models `` nullify '' the ks theorem , was premature ; in fact , fallacious .",
    "however , the models themselves are deeply interesting .",
    "they confirm the fact that there are depths to the ks theorem which , in the past , have not been sufficiently appreciated ( `` confirm '' because this point had , in fact , already been established by the constructions of pitowsky  @xcite ) .",
    "mkc take it to be almost self - evident that the existence of dense ks - colourable subsets of @xmath30 `` nullifies '' the ks theorem .",
    "we have argued that they are mistaken , and that there is actually no nullification .",
    "however , the mistake is far from obvious .",
    "contention seems , at first sight , highly plausible .",
    "at least , it seemed highly plausible to the present author , before he began to seriously engage with the problem .    in order to see that the mkc models do not `` nullify '' the ks theorem it is necessary to appreciate the point made in section  [ sec : extendks1 ] , that a process does not count as a classical measurement unless it reveals , not simply a pre - existing _ value _ , but a pre - existing piece of classical _",
    "information_. to put it another way , the outcome of a classical measurement is , not simply a bare number , but a determinate proposition , which expresses some pre - existing classical fact .",

    "these points have not been explicitly recognized .",
    "they are , however , crucial , as the mkc models demonstrate .",
    "although the mkc models do not `` nullify '' the ks theorem , they do cast important new light on the physical implications of the ks theorem .",
    "they show that there are subtleties to the physical interpretation of the ks theorem which have not , in the past , been sufficiently emphasized .",
    "for this reason the work of mkc is valuable .",
    "although we have presented our discussion in the form of a criticism it might , in some ways , be more appropriate if it was seen , in terms which are less prejudicial , as one more contribution to a line of investigation which pitowsky  @xcite initiated , and which mkc have continued .",
    "it is a line of investigation which might be worth pursuing further .",
    "pitowsky s constructions are particularly interesting in this respect , because he challenges traditional assumptions at a much more fundamental level .",
    "for instance , he challenges the assumption that sets which are not lebesgue - measurable have no physical significance .",
    "pitowsky s idea , that `` one can , as it were , reduce physical paradox to a mathematical ` pathology ' '' , is unlikely to lead to a classical explanation of quantum phenomena ( a `` pathological '' theory  which is to say , a theory that seems strange as judged by the standards of ordinary intuition  is a non - classical theory , almost by definition ) .",
    "however , that does not seem to be pitowsky s intention .",
    "rather , he seeks to gain additional insight , into what quantum mechanics is actually telling us , by considering the problem from a new and unusual perspective .",

( [ eq : vonneu ] ) _ precisely_. a more realistic model of the kind of measurement which it might actually be possible to perform , in the laboratory , would be @xmath172 where the coefficients @xmath173 are small .    of course , the model measurement process described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : proxvonneu ] ) , though more realistic than the one described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vonneu ] ) , is still highly idealized .",
    "a real laboratory instrument is a complex macroscopic system having many other degrees of freedom apart from the pointer observable .",
    "it is also an open system , undergoing non - negligible interactions with its environment ( these interactions play an important role in accounting for the fact that system+instrument are in a mixed state at the end of the measurement process  @xcite ) .",
    "lastly , it should be noted that in a real laboratory measurement the final state correlations are often ( though not always ) very poor ( for instance , in the traditional stern - gerlach arrangement , where the particle hits a photographic plate , the result of the measurement does not contain useful information regarding the _ final _ spin state of the particle ) .",
    "however , the model is sufficiently realistic for present purposes .    the unitary operator @xmath126 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : proxvonneu ] ) is close to the unitary operator describing a von neumann measurement . in other words",
    ", it describes an approximate von neumann measurement .",
    "the process is not an ideal measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "it is , however , a _ non - ideal _ measurement ( which is the most that can reasonably be demanded of a real laboratory procedure ) . specifically :    it discriminates eigenstates with a high degree of reliability ( if the system is initially in the eigenstate @xmath171 , then there is a high probability that the final pointer reading will approximately be @xmath125 )",
    ".    the final state correlations are good ( if the final pointer reading is found to be @xmath125 then @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the reduced density matrix describing the final state of the system , after the pointer has been read ) .",
    "these properties should be compared with the defining characteristics of an ideal measurement ( items  1 and  2 above ) .",
    "we now show that the process also effects a non - ideal measurement of every other observable which is sufficiently close to @xmath2 .",
    "choose some continuous parameterization for the onbs ( orthonormal bases ) in @xmath166 , so that @xmath176 is the onb with parameter value @xmath177 .",

    "we conclude that @xmath126 describes a non - ideal measurement of @xmath3 for every @xmath3 close to @xmath2as claimed .",

    "a stern - gerlach measurement is not an ideal measurement of _ anything _ : not an ideal measurement of the nominal observable , which the experimeter records as having been measured , and not an ideal measurement of any other observable either  @xcite . measurements of this kind might be described as _ completely _ non - ideal .",
    "it is easily seen that they are , in a certain well - defined sense , typical , or generic .    if the measurement described by eq .",

    "the space of coefficients @xmath173 may be identified with a neighbourhood in the coset space @xmath193 , having dimension @xmath194 .",
    "it follows that , if @xmath195 , the set of measurements assumed by mkc constitute a proper , lower - dimensional submanifold of the manifold of all non - ideal measurements .",
    "this means that , if one were to select a set of coefficients @xmath173 satisfying the unitarity condition at random , then , for many reasonable choices of probability measure , there would be probability zero that the measurement which resulted was of the special kind assumed by mkc . in any case , the contrary hypothesis , that a randomly chosen laboratory measurement is likely to be of the kind assumed by mkc , can not be considered plausible .",
    "suppose , however , that a laboratory measurement of @xmath2 did happen to be of the very special kind assumed by mkc .",
    "then there would be some observable @xmath25 which was measured ideally .",
    "however , mkc would still not be justified in arguing that @xmath3 is the only observable that is `` actually '' measured .",
    "the fact that the measurement of @xmath3 is slightly better than the measurement of @xmath2 does not imply that @xmath2 is not measured _ at all_. a measurement does not have to be strictly ideal in order to count as a measurement ( otherwise one would have to say that a stern - gerlach apparatus does _ not _ measure spin , and that real photon detectors do _ not _ detect photons ) .",

    "@xcite and larsson  @xcite ( sbzl ) claim to have proved an operational generalization of the ks theorem , applying to real experiments ( larsson , however , does not use the word `` operational '' ) .",
    "their result inspired the generalized ks theorem proved in section  [ sec : extendks2 ] of this paper .",
    "it also inspired part of the argument in section  [ sec : seq ] .",
    "however , although we are very significantly indebted to sbzl , we also have some significant criticisms .",
    "we will argue , in fact , that their operational version of the theorem is invalid .    in the following we begin by criticizing sbzl s operational definition of contextuality .",
    "we go on to identify a loophole in sbzl s argument .",
    "we conclude by exhibiting a model which gets through the loophole , and which provides a concrete counter - example to their operational version of the generalized ks theorem .",
    "sbzl consider an instrument which performs measurements of each of the @xmath87 triads contained in some fixed ks uncolourable set .",
    "the triad to be measured is determined by three switches .",
    "they assume that the system+instrument combination is fully specified by : ( 1 ) the three switch positions @xmath314 , ( 2 ) the system hidden variables @xmath315 , ( 3 ) the instrument hidden variables @xmath316 ( larsson , however , denotes the pair @xmath317 by the single symbol @xmath81 ) . in general , the @xmath318 pointer reading is given by a function @xmath319 which depends on all three switch positions , as well as the hidden variables .",
    "sbzl take it that a theory is non - contextual in an operational sense if and only if there exists , for each measuring instrument , a single function @xmath320 such that @xmath321 for @xmath212 .",
    "this definition has the following features : ( 1 ) if the instrument is different then the function @xmath320 may be different and ( 2 ) @xmath320 depends on the instrument hidden variables @xmath316 , as well as the system hidden variables @xmath315 . for these reasons",
    "it is not a definition of non - contextuality in the ordinary sense .",
    "a non - contextual theory ( in the ordinary sense ) is a theory in which measurements reveal the pre - existing values of the observables measured .",
    "it is , in other words , a classical theory , at least so far as the concept of measurement is concerned .",
    "non - contextuality in sbzl s operational sense , by contrast , does not have the implication that measurements reveal pre - existing values ( of the observables measured ) .",
    "it is not a signature of classicality .",
    "in fact , we will show that it is not even inconsistent with the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is therefore inappropriate .",
    "at least , it is inappropriate if the aim is to identify hypotheses which the empirically verifiable predictions of quantum mechanics exclude .    before proceeding",
    "further it will be convenient to digress , and consider the ordinary concept of non - contextuality in a little more detail .",
    "the context of a measurement is the particular procedure used to carry out the measurement .",
    "alternatively , it is what bohr  @xcite describes as the `` whole experimental arrangement '' , and what bell  @xcite describes as the `` complete disposition of the apparatus '' .",
    "the term `` contextuality '' or `` context - dependence '' refers to the phenomenon in which different procedures for measuring the same observable have different outcomes , even though the hidden state of the system is initially the same .",
    "a theory in which measurements reveal pre - existing values ( of the observables measured ) is obviously guaranteed to be non - contextual .",
    "the converse is also true : if a theory is non - contextual , then measurements reveal pre - existing values ( of the observables measured ) .",
    "it may perhaps happen that pre - existing values are not explicitly mentioned , in the formal description of a non - contextual theory .",
    "nevertheless , they must be present implicitly ( since , if the theory predicts that a measurement of @xmath2 will always produce the value @xmath125 , then that effectively means the theory assigns to @xmath2 the value @xmath125 ) .",
    "to say that a theory is non - contextual is _ logically equivalent _ to saying that it is a theory in which measurements reveal pre - existing values ( of the observables measured ) .",
    "there is a tendency , in formal discussions , to focus on one particular kind of contextuality : namely , the kind where the result of measuring @xmath2 depends on which other commuting observables @xmath322 are jointly measured along with @xmath2 .",
    "it is an important kind of contextuality because it lends itself to the proof of general theorems .",
    "however , there are many other kinds .",
    "a difference in measurement context is _ any _ difference in the detailed specification of the apparatus used for performing the measurement .",
    "it need not be a major difference .",
    "suppose , for example , that the shape of the pole pieces in a stern - gerlach arrangement was slightly changed .",
    "this would count as a change of context .",
    "a real laboratory instrument admits numerous minor variations on the basic design .",
    "a theory is not genuinely non - contextual unless measurement outcomes are insensitive to every such variation .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbzlnoncontextdef ] ) the function @xmath320 depends on the instrument , and on @xmath316 .",
    "it follows that sbzl s operational criterion does not imply that measurement outcomes are genuinely independent of context .",
    "sbzl tend to focus on the switch positions and pointer readings as the features of the measuring apparatus of which the experimenter has knowledge ( `` the switch position is all he knows about '' , as it is expressed in ref .",
    "however a real measuring apparatus has many other controllable parameters : for example , the number of turns in each coil , the exact position of each screw , the pressure in each evacuated chamber , _",
    "etc.etc_. a small change in one of these parameters will be reflected by a change in the probability distribution on the variables @xmath316 , if not by a change in the function @xmath320 itself .",
    "consequently , it may have a large affect on the measurement outcome , even in a theory satisfying sbzl s operational criterion .",
    "sbzl s operational criterion is , in one way , too weak .",
    "not only does their criterion fail to exclude models which are highly non - classical .",
    "it is not even inconsistent with the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics ( see the example at the end of this appendix ) .",
    "their criterion is , in another way , too strong .",
    "we stated earlier that a non - contextual theory is one in which measurements reveal pre - existing values ( of the observables measured ) .",
    "however , this only applies to ideal measurements .",
    "non - ideal measurements do not certainly reveal exact pre - existing values , and so they may only be approximately independent of context .",
    "sbzl s criterion is meant to apply to real laboratory measurements .",
    "it is therefore unduly restrictive in requiring that , for given @xmath315 , @xmath316 , measurements of @xmath323 in the contexts @xmath129 and @xmath324 must , _ with certainty _ , have the same outcome ( this point is closely related to the point we made at the end of section  [ sec : extendks2 ] , when we argued that the condition @xmath325 is not sufficient to ensure a contradiction with classical assumptions ) .    in short ,",
    "the criterion for a theory to be genuinely non - contextual is , not eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbzlnoncontextdef ] ) , but @xmath326 for all @xmath327 in a set of probability measure @xmath328 , and for some function @xmath40 which ( unlike @xmath320 and @xmath329 ) is the same for all measuring instruments .",
    "it will be seen that this is , in effect , the criterion we used in section  [ sec : extendks2 ] .",
    "let us now consider sbzl s argument .",
    "sbzl consider a set of @xmath87 switch settings @xmath330 which can not consistently be coloured . for each @xmath272 ,",
    "let @xmath331 be the set of hidden variables @xmath332 such that @xmath333 where @xmath320 is the function defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbzlnoncontextdef ] ) above .",
    "let @xmath334 and @xmath335 be the hidden state spaces of system and instrument respectively , and let @xmath240 be the probability measure on @xmath336 describing the system+instrument combination .",
    "sbzl make the crucial assumption , that @xmath240 is the same for all switch settings .",
    "it follows from the definitions that @xmath337 for all @xmath272 ( where @xmath77 is the quantity which sbzl denote @xmath79 , and which is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsqdef ] ) of this paper ) . in view of the fact that @xmath338 this implies @xmath339 sbzl",
    "conclude that theories which are non - contextual in their operational sense can not reproduce the quantum mechanical predictions for an apparatus with @xmath340 .",
    "the problem with this argument is the fact that it rests on the assumption that @xmath240 is the same for all switch settings . the assumption is not justified .",
    "changing the switch settings changes the quantum state of the instrument . in a hidden variables",
    "theory the quantum state of the instrument is represented by a probability measure on @xmath341 ( where @xmath342 is the space of switch settings ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this probability measure will be of the form @xmath343 , where @xmath344 is a @xmath344-function measure on @xmath342 .",
    "however , there is no reason to assume that @xmath177 is the same for all switch settings  which is what would be needed if sbzl s assumption was to be justified .",
    "to find an example of a hidden variables theory to which sbzl s assumption is inapplicable , one does not need to look further than the bohm theory . in the bohm theory the probability distribution is given by the square of the modulus of the wave function , in the @xmath1-space representation . changing the switch settings",
    "changes the wave function , and so it will , in general , change the probability distribution .",
    "it is not simply that sbzl s argument is not sufficient to establish their conclusion .",
    "their conclusion is not true  as we now show , by means of a counter - example .",
    "the example we choose is a model of mkc type .",
    "it has the property @xmath78 .",
    "the model is not non - contextual in the ordinary sense , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbzlnoncontextdefb ] ) . however , it _ is _ non - contextual in sbzl s operational sense , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbzlnoncontextdef ] ) .",
    "let @xmath30 be the unit 2-sphere , and let @xmath44 be the dense , ks - colourable subset on which the mkc valuations are defined . for each @xmath315 ,",
    "let @xmath345 be the associated valuation .",
    "if the hidden state of the instrument is @xmath316 the measurement reveals the pre - existing values of a triad @xmath346 .",
    "the probability measure on @xmath335 is such that @xmath347 is always extremely close to the triad of switch settings ( this means that the probability measure must be strongly dependent on the switch settings  contrary to what is assumed by sbzl ) .    given any vector @xmath31 let @xmath348 be the index @xmath230 for which the scalar product @xmath349 is maximal ( ambiguities being resolved by taking the smallest such index ) .",
    "then the @xmath318 pointer reading is given by @xmath350 comparing this equation with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbzlnoncontextdef ] ) it can be seen that the model is non - contextual in sbzl s operational sense ( with @xmath351 ) . on the other hand",
    "the fact that @xmath352 is a ks - colouring implies @xmath353 .",
    "the example thus shows that sbzl s operational version of the generalized ks theorem is invalid .    of course , the model is non - contextual in the ordinary sense , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbzlnoncontextdefb ] ) .",
    "consequently , there is no contradiction with the result proved in section  [ sec : extendks2 ] : that theories which are non - contextual in the ordinary sense can not reproduce the quantum mechanical predictions for an apparatus with @xmath354 .",
    "the model actually shows that non - contextuality in sbzl s operational sense is not inconsistent with the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics , even as regards the outcome of measurements for which @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , it also provides some additional grounds for considering their operational criterion to be inappropriate .",
    "kent  @xcite has argued that a sequential measurement , such as the one illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : sequential ] , is not a joint measurement . according to him",
    "a process does not count as a joint measurement unless the different observables are measured all together , in parallel so to speak .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to explain why we consider this position to be unjustified .",
    "measuring instruments are defined functionally , in terms of what they do .",
    "this is true both classically and quantum mechanically .",
    "if a system performs the _ function _ , of an instrument which measures @xmath2 , then it _ is _ an instrument which measures @xmath2 .",
    "the function of a classical measuring instrument is to reveal pre - existing values .",
    "suppose that one has a sealed box with a dial and two terminals on the front , and suppose that one wishes to confirm that it is a classical ammeter .",
    "this question can be decided without looking inside the box .",
    "it is sufficient to test the instrument with known currents , and check that it reads correctly .",
    "anything which does the job of a classical ammeter , is a classical ammeter .",
    "similar considerations apply in quantum mechanics .",
    "the function of a quantum measuring instrument is to discriminate eigenstates .",
    "suppose one has a sealed box , with a hole into which spin 1 particles can be injected , and a digital readout .",
    "suppose it is found , after testing , that the box correctly identifies the joint eigenstates of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "then that is enough to establish that it jointly measures these observables .",
    "anything which discriminates the joint eigenstates of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , jointly measures these observables .",
    "in particular , the apparatus illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequential ] jointly measures them .",
    "a quantum measurement can always be conceived in `` black - box '' terms . in order to decide whether a process is a quantum measurement of a given set of commuting observables",
    "it is only necessary to consider the state of system+apparatus at the time when the measurement interaction commences and again , at the time when the interaction is concluded ( the difference between these times necessarily being @xmath239 ) . if the initial and final states are related in the required manner , then the process is a measurement of the observables concerned .",
    "questions as to the detailed behaviour of the state between these times , during the course of the interaction , are irrelevant .",
