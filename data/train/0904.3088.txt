    "the six - vertex model , or the model of two - dimensional ice , is stated on a square @xmath9 lattice with arrows on edges .",

    "such a rule is sometimes called the _ ice - rule_. there are only six possible configurations of arrows at each vertex , hence the name of the model , see fig .  1 .    [ arrows ]    we will consider the _ domain wall boundary conditions _ ( dwbc ) , in which the arrows on the upper and lower boundaries point into the square , and the ones on the left and right boundaries point out .",
    "one possible configuration with dwbc on the @xmath10 lattice is shown on fig .  2 .    [ dwbc ]    for each possible vertex state we assign a weight @xmath11 , and define , as usual , the partition function as a sum over all possible arrow configurations of the product of the vertex weights , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath9 set of vertices , @xmath14 is the vertex - type of configuration @xmath15 at vertex @xmath16 according to fig . 1 , and @xmath17 is the number of vertices of type @xmath18 in the configuration @xmath15 .",
    "the sum is taken over all possible configurations obeying the given boundary condition .",

    "it can be reduced to only two parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "namely , we have that @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 furthermore , @xmath25 and @xmath26 so that a general weight reduces to the two parameters , @xmath27 .",
