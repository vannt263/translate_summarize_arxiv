    "the quantum information processing ( qip ) is one of the interesting areas in physics which is gaining momentum both in theoretical and experimental fronts in the recent years .",
    "mostly , the single valence ions particularly the ones with @xmath2 ground states are being chosen for qip studies @xcite to encode qubits into the hyperfine levels .",
    "these levels are chosen due to their relatively long lifetimes against spontaneous decay rates and long phase coherence because of their small energy separations .",
    "the hyperfine structure studies help us understand the nuclear structure of an atom and its influence on the short range wavefunctions correctly @xcite .",
    "the rapid progress in the development of technology involving laser cooling and ion trapping has made possible to bring these theoretical ideas to fruition and singly ionized zinc ( zn@xmath3 ) is one of the recent important inclusion in that family @xcite .",
    "though there are a few studies of radiative lifetimes of zn@xmath3 in the literature @xcite , its hyperfine structures are not studied so far limited to the best of our knowledge . here , we have carried out the magnetic dipole ( @xmath4 ) and electric quadrupole ( @xmath5 ) hyperfine structure studies of @xmath0zn@xmath3 for principle quantum number n=4 states which is wanted for the qip studies as mentioned above .",
    "zn is also one of the important elements in astrophysics , especially for the understanding of the post - main sequence evolution of the chemically peculiar stars , in which zn is either scarce ( if not non - existing ) or over abundant @xcite .",
    "the high resolution spectra obtained from ghrs onboard _",
    "hubble space telescope _ has provided vital informations about its abundances @xcite .",
    "applications of the radiative transitions of this ion in cosmology , stellar dynamics , interstellar medium , nucleosynthesis etc . have been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "it seems from the reported results that , there exits disagreements in the lifetime estimations among the experimental measurements and various theoretical calculations .",
    "one distinct feature of the lifetime table is the order of the @xmath6 fine structure states , i.e. , the lifetime of the @xmath7 state should be less than the lifetime of @xmath8 state according to both experiments available @xcite .",
    "this was not found in any of the _ ab initio _ studied so far @xcite .",
    "our calculated lifetimes for the @xmath8 and @xmath7 states which are reported here , have the same order as well as in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the one - electron reduced matrix elements corresponding to e1 , m1 and e2 transitions are given in these papers @xcite .",
    "the emission transition probabilities ( in sec@xmath9 ) for the e1 , e2 and m1 channels from states _ f _ to _ i _ are given by @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the transition strength for the operator o ( in a.u . ) and @xmath14 ( in( ) ) is the corresponding transition wavelength .",
    "the lifetime of a particular state is the reciprocal of the total transition probability arising from all possible spontaneous electromagnetic transitions from the state to all the lower energy levels .",
    "+ @xmath15    the interaction between the electromagnetic multipole moments of the electrons and the electromagnetic field created at the site of the nucleus is termed as hyperfine interaction and the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xcite    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the spherical tensor operators of rank @xmath19 in the nuclear and electronic spaces , respectively .",
    "the @xmath19=1 and 2 terms of the expansion represent the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interactions , respectively .",
    "the diagonal hyperfine interaction constants can be written as @xcite @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the total angular momentums of nucleus and electrons ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the nucleus , respectively .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 operators are defined as @xmath28 and @xmath29 where , @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the spherical harmonic functions . + in the first - order perturbation theory , the hyperfine energy @xmath32 of the fine - structure state @xmath33 is the expectation value of the corresponding hyperfine interaction hamiltonians in that state .",
    "the energies corresponding to the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperfine transition are defined as @xmath34 and @xmath35    where @xmath36 with @xmath37 . here",
    "we have neglected higher order hyperfine interactions .",
    "the basic formalism of the valence universal coupled - cluster ( cc ) method was developed more than two decades before @xcite however a suitably relativistic version of this approach has been successfully employed to obtain the various properties accurately in different single valence atomic systems only recently @xcite .",
    "here we just outline the method applied in this calculation of the wavefunctions of zn@xmath3 accurately .    the single valence cc theory extended for the relativistic framework and",
    "is based on the no - virtual - pair approximation with dirac - fock orbitals @xcite .",
    "the concept of the common vacuum for both the closed - shell @xmath38 and open - shell @xmath39 electron systems allows to formulate a direct method of excitation energies .",
    "the dynamical electron correlation effects are introduced through the _ valence - universal _ wave - operator @xmath40 @xcite for the state with @xmath41 as the valence orbital is written in the normal ordered form as , @xmath42 where cluster operator @xmath43 represents excitations from the occupied core orbitals of the closed shell system zn@xmath44 and @xmath45 represent the core - valence and valence - valence excitations .",
    "dominant among these correlations are pair correlations and core polarizations .",
    "the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian dressed with the excitation cluster operators @xmath43 and @xmath46 are then diagonalized within the model space constructed from the core and valence orbitals to obtain the desired eigenvalues and eigenvectors @xcite . in this work ,",
    "a leading order triple excitations are included in the open shell cc amplitude evaluation by an approximation that is similar in spirit to ccsd(t ) method @xcite .",
    "the expectation value of any operator @xmath47 can be expressed in the cc method as @xmath48",
    "we have used gaussian - type orbitals ( gto ) to calculate the df wavefunctions @xmath49 as given in @xcite using the basis functions of the form @xcite + @xmath50 where @xmath51 for s , p , d , f ..... type orbital symmetries respectively .",
    "the large and small components of the relativistic gtos satisfy the kinetic balance condition @xcite .",
    "the exponents are determined by the even tempering condition ; i.e. , for each symmetry exponents are assigned as @xmath52 where n is the number of basis functions for the specific symmetry . in this calculation , we have used @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    ". the number of basis functions used in the present calculation are 32 , 32 , 30 , 25 , 20 for @xmath55 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 symmetries , respectively .",
    ".radiative lifetimes(ns ) for different low - lying states of @xmath0zn@xmath1 . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : results1 ]",
    "in this work , we have determined the hyperfine structure constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the ground state and a few low - lying excited states in @xmath0zn@xmath3 using the relativistic coupled - cluster theory .",
    "we have also calculated the hyperfine energy separation for the ground state , which is 7018.743 mhz .",
    "there is no experimental result available for the hyperfine energy separation for the ground state , which seems to be an important candidate for qip studies .",
    "also , @xmath0zn@xmath1 can be considered as one of the promising candidates for the frequency standard in the microwave region .",
    "we have also determined the lifetimes of the low - lying state sin zn@xmath1 , which are in good agreement with experimental results .",
    "especially our calculated lifetimes of 4@xmath56 fine structure states explain the same trend as observed in the experiments @xcite i.e. , the lifetime of @xmath7 state is shorter than the @xmath8 state , unlike many other theoretical results which show opposite trend and also the ratio of their lifetimes in our calculation is in excellent agreement with the experimental result.this suggests that the relativistic cc method applied in the present work and our numerical approach in obtaining the wavefunctions of the system considered are more accurate and reliable .",
