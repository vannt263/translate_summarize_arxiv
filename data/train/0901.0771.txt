    "since the leps collaboration announced the evidence of the @xmath9  @xcite , being motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite in which its decay width was predicted to be very small with its mass @xmath10 mev  @xcite , it intrigued a great deal of experimental and theoretical works on the @xmath9 ( see , for example , reviews  @xcite for the experimental and theoretical status before 2006 ) .",
    "however , the clas collaboration conducted a series of experiments and reported eventually null results of finding the @xmath9  @xcite in various reactions .",
    "considering the fact that these clas experiments were dedicated ones with high statistics , these null results from the clas experiment are remarkable and indicate that the total cross sections for photoproductions of the @xmath9 should be tiny .",
    "in fact , the @xmath11 confidence level ( cl ) upper limits on the total cross sections for the @xmath9 at @xmath10 mev lie mostly in the range of @xmath12 nb  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the upper limit on the @xmath13 total cross section turned out to be about 5 nb in the mass range from @xmath14 mev to @xmath15 mev with a @xmath16 cl .",
    "the kek - ps - e522 collaboration  @xcite has carried out the experiment searching for the @xmath9 via the @xmath17 reaction and found a bump at around @xmath18 mev but with only @xmath19 statistical significance . moreover , the upper limit of the @xmath9-production cross section in the @xmath20 reaction was extracted to be @xmath21 . a later experiment at kek ( kek - ps - e559 ) , however , has observed no clear peak structure for the @xmath9 in the @xmath22 reaction  @xcite , giving a @xmath16 cl upper limit of @xmath23b / sr for the differential cross section averaged over from @xmath24 to @xmath25 in the laboratory system .",
    "this negative situation is summarized in the 2008 review of particle physics by wohl  @xcite : `` _ the whole story  the discoveries themselves , the tidal wave of papers by theorists and phenomenologists that followed , and the eventual `` undiscovery ''  is a curious episode in the history of science . _ ''    in the meanwhile , the diana collaboration has continued to search for the @xmath9 in the @xmath26 reaction and has reported a direct formation of a narrow @xmath27 peak with mass of @xmath28 mev and width of @xmath29 mev  @xcite . compared to the former measurement by the diana collaboration for the @xmath9 , the decay width was more precisely measured in this new experiment  @xcite , the statistics being doubled . the svd experiment has also reported a narrow peak with the mass , @xmath30 mev in the inclusive reaction @xmath31  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the leps collaboration has brought news very recently on the evidence of the @xmath9  @xcite : the mass of the @xmath9 is found at @xmath32 mev and the statistical significance of the peak turns out to be @xmath33 .",
    "the peak position is shifted by @xmath34 systematically due to the minimum momentum spectator approximation ( mmsa ) .",
    "the differential cross section was estimated to be @xmath35 in the photon energy ranging from 2.0 gev to 2.4 gev in the leps angular range .",
    "although it seems that the pentaquark baryon @xmath9 rarely exists according to certain experiments as explained above , it is still theoretically necessary to understand why the @xmath9 is so elusive and intractable .",
    "as mentioned previously , one of the reasons can be found in the fact that the cross sections of the @xmath9 photoproduction as well as of the mesonic production are observed to be minuscule .",
    "the origin of these tiny cross sections can be understood by the smallness of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 coupling constants , as mentioned explicitly in refs .",
    "a similar conclusion was also found in ref .",
    "moreover , the decay width of the @xmath36 , observed by the diana collaboration , indicates that the @xmath2 coupling constant must be small , as was reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . from the theoretical side , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that the tensor coupling constant for the @xmath3 vertex is very small and has predicted the total cross section for the @xmath9 photoproduction to be around @xmath37 even before the clas measurement , in which the cross section for the @xmath9 photoproduction was estimated to be below @xmath38 nb  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite has evaluated the smaller value of the @xmath3 tensor coupling constant , employing the vector meson dominance with su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the vector coupling constant for the @xmath3 vertex vanishes in su(3 ) symmetry due to the generalized ademollo - gatto theorem as shown in ref .",

    "the @xmath2 coupling constant was determined to be @xmath41 , which leads to the corresponding the decay width of the @xmath9 : @xmath42 mev  @xcite .",
    "note that these results in the @xmath4qsm are all derived without adjusting any parameters .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the photoproduction of the @xmath9 was investigated , based on effective lagrangian approaches . however , since the coupling constants and cut - off masses were unknown both experimentally and theoretically , it was very difficult to describe the production mechanism of the @xmath9 without any ambiguity .",
    "thus , in the present work , we want to reexamine the photoproduction of the @xmath9 , incorporating the @xmath2 and @xmath3 coupling cosntants and cut - off masses from refs .",
    "the results will be shown that the magnitudes of the total cross section and differential cross section are qualitatively compatible with those of the leps and clas data .",
    "we sketch the structure of the present work as follows : in section ii , we briefly review the coupling constants of the @xmath43 and @xmath8 exchange , which play critical roles in describing the photoproduction of the @xmath9 . in section iii , we explain the general formalism of the effective lagrangian method . in section iv , we present the numerical results and discuss them . the final section is devoted to summary and conclusion .",
