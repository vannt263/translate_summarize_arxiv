    "the electron dephasing time @xmath0 is a very important quantity that governs the mesoscopic phenomena at low temperatures .",
    "particularly , the behavior of the dephasing time near zero temperature , @xmath2 , has recently attracted vigorous experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite attention .",
    "one of the central themes of this renewed interest is concerned with whether @xmath3 should reach a finite or an infinite value as @xmath4 0 .",
    "the connection of the zero - temperature dephasing behavior with the very fundamental condensed matter physics problems such as the validity of the fermi - liquid picture , the possibility of the occurrence of a quantum phase transition , and the persistent currents in metals , etc .",
    ", has been addressed .",
    "conventionally , it is accepted that @xmath3 should reach an infinite value if there exist only the inelastic electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering . however",
    ", several recent measurements performed on different mesoscopic conductors have revealed that @xmath3 depends only very weakly on @xmath5 , if at all , when @xmath5 is sufficiently low .",
    "there is no generally accepted process of electron  low - energy - excitation interactions that can satisfactorily explain the  saturation \" of @xmath3 found in the experiments .",
    "it should be noted that those experiments @xcite have ruled out electron heating , external microwave noises , and very dilute magnetic impurities as the origins for the observed finite dephasing as @xmath6 .",
    "to unravel the issue of electron dephasing , systematic information of @xmath3 over a wide range of sample properties is very desirable . bearing this in mind , we have in this work performed systematic measurements of @xmath3 on several series of _ as - sputtered _ and subsequently _ annealed _ aupd and sb _ thick _ films .",
    "the low - field magnetoresistances of the as - sputtered samples are first measured .",
    "the samples are then annealed , and their magnetoresistances measured .",
    "the annealing and magnetoresistance measurement procedures are repeated a few times .",
    "@xmath0 is extracted by comparing the measured magnetoresistances with the three - dimensional ( 3d ) weak - localization ( wl ) theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "generally , thermal annealing causes a decrease in the sample resistivity , signifying a reduction in the amount of defects in the microstructures . controlled annealing measurements are thus crucial for testing the theoretical models of electron dephasing invoking magnetic impurities and dynamical defects @xcite .",
    "thick film samples were prepared by dc sputtering deposition onto glass substrates held at room temperature . the deposition rate was varied to tune the amount of disorder , i.e. , the residual resistivity @xmath7 (= @xmath8(10 k ) ) of the films .",
    "the aupd films were typically 6000 @xmath9 @xmath10 0.3 mm @xmath10 17 mm , while the sb films were typically 3000 @xmath9 @xmath10 0.3 mm @xmath10 17 mm .",
    "thermal annealing of the aupd ( sb ) films was performed in a 99.999% pure ar atmosphere at moderate temperatures of @xmath11 100@xmath12300@xmath13c ( @xmath11 150@xmath13c ) for about one half to several hours until @xmath7 changed by a desirable amount .",
    "the use of an extremely high purity ar atmosphere greatly minimized the presence of any oxygen residual gas in the annealing .",
    "the values of the relevant parameters for our as - sputtered films are listed in table  [ t.1 ] .",
    ".resistivities , diffusion constants , and dephasing times of the as - sputtered aupd and sb thick films .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is extracted by least - squares fitting the measured @xmath14 to eq .",
    "@xmath15 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t.1 ]    we notice that the four aupd films listed in table [ t.1 ] were _ newly _ made from a _ new _ au@xmath16pd@xmath16 target different from that used in our previous study @xcite . moreover , a _ different _ sputtering gun and a different vacuum chamber were utilized .",
    "previously , we had studied @xmath0 in a series of dc sputtered aupd thick films prepared and measured in a different laboratory @xcite . by applying these new samples",
    ", we are able to perform a close comparison study of @xmath0 in the same material prepared under different conditions .",
    "such a comparison is indispensable for clarifying the possible role , if at all , of magnetic scattering on @xmath3 .",
    "if there were any noticeable magnetic contamination during this experiment , it is natural to expect an _",
    "unintentional _ magnetic concentration , @xmath17 , that differs from that in our previously samples @xcite .",
    "consequently , a distinct value of @xmath3 should be observed . on the other hand ,",
    "if a similar value of @xmath3 is measured , this result must then bear important information about an intrinsic material property .",
    "in addition to the newly prepared aupd samples , we have studied two  aged \" sb films .",
    "the two sb films listed in table [ t.1 ] were first deposited and studied two years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite . during the past two years",
    ", they were exposed to air all the time .",
    "one might have naively speculated that these two samples must be heavily contaminated by ( magnetic ) impurities and , thus , have a shorter @xmath0 with a much weaker @xmath5 dependence , compared with that measured two years ago . to the contrary , this experiment indicates that 3d aupd and sb are _ not _ as vulnerable to contamination as speculated .",
    "our results point to an experimental fact that suggests that the observed saturation of @xmath3 can not be readily explained by magnetic scattering .",
    "we have measured the magnetoresistances and compared with 3d wl predictions @xcite to extract the values of @xmath0 .",
    "our experimental method and data analysis procedure had been discussed previously @xcite . here",
    "we emphasize that , in the limit of strong spin - orbit scattering ( which applies for both aupd and sb ) , @xmath0 is the _ only _ adjusting parameter in the least - squares fits of the measured magnetoresistances with wl predictions .",
    "this great advantage makes the extraction of @xmath0 highly reliable .",
    "empirically , @xmath0 can be written in the form @xmath18 where @xmath3 dominates at the lowest measurement temperatures , and @xmath19 is the relevant inelastic scattering time which is usually important at a ( few ) degree(s ) kelvin and higher . in three dimensions ,",
    "electron - phonon scattering is the predominant inelastic process while the nyquist electron - electron scattering is negligibly small @xcite , i.e. @xmath20 in eq .",
    "the electron - phonon scattering rate @xmath21 varies as @xmath22 , with 2 @xmath23 4 .",
    "figure  [ f.1](a ) shows our measured @xmath0 as a function of temperature for four as - sputtered aupd films .",
    "this figure demonstrates that @xmath0 first increases with decreasing @xmath5 at a few degrees kelvin , where the electron - phonon scattering dominates the total dephasing and @xmath24 in aupd @xcite . below about 2 k ,",
    "the inelastic process is much less effective and a new mechanism progressively takes over , resulting in a very weak temperature dependence of @xmath0 as @xmath25 . to our knowledge , there is no generally accepted process of electron  low - energy - excitation interactions that can account for such a weak @xmath5 behavior .",
    "a weak temperature dependence of @xmath3 is also observed in the two sb thick films listed in table  [ t.1 ] .",
    "in fact , an ( almost ) absence of temperature dependence of @xmath0 has previously been found in numerous three - dimensional polycrystalline metals @xcite .",
    "we notice that the values of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ f.1](a ) follow _ closely _ the scaling relation of @xmath26 s established in fig .",
    "3 of @xcite , where the diffusion constant @xmath27 is in @xmath28/s .",
    "this result suggests that the behavior of @xmath0 found in fig .",
    "[ f.1](a ) is material intrinsic .",
    "it should be emphasized that the weak @xmath5 dependence or the so - called  saturation \" of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ f.1](a ) is observed in a temperature regime where the sample resistance varies as @xmath29 all the way down to our lowest measurement temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ f.1](b ) ) .",
    "this @xmath29 dependence of resistance is well described by the 3d electron - electron interaction effects @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the saturation of @xmath3 is _ not _ caused by electron heating .",
    "a similar assertion of non - hot - electron effects has also been reached in previous experiments @xcite .",
    "information about the effect of annealing is crucial for clarifying the nature of magnetic scattering and dynamical defects .",
    "figure  [ f.2](a ) shows the variation of @xmath0 with temperature for the as - prepared and subsequently annealed aupd1e thick film .",
    "this figure clearly indicates that @xmath0 increases with annealing .",
    "similar behavior of increasing @xmath0 with annealing has also been found in the as - prepared and annealed aupd6e thick film . at first glance , this observation is easily explained .",
    "suppose that annealing results in the rearrangement of lattice atoms and relaxation of grain boundaries and , hence , makes the film less disordered .",
    "because two - level systems ( tls ) are closely associated with the presence of defects in the microstructures , their number concentration would be reduced by annealing . by assuming that dynamical defects are effective scatterers",
    ", one can then understand fig .",
    "[ f.2](a ) in terms of a reducing tls picture .",
    "however , our further measurements indicate that the nature of low - temperature dephasing in real metals is not so straightforward .",
    "we find that the effect of annealing on @xmath0 is distinctly different in strongly disordered samples ( fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] ) . for the convenience of discussion , the aupd1e and aupd6e ( aupd4a and aupd5e ) thick films are referred to as moderately ( strongly ) disordered , because they have @xmath30 120 ( 470 ) @xmath31 cm before annealing .",
    "figure  [ f.2](b ) shows the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath5 for the as - prepared and annealed sb01b thick film .",
    "this figure clearly indicates that @xmath0 increases with annealing .",
    "similar effect of annealing has also been found in the sb12 thick film .",
    "the results of figs .",
    "[ f.2](a ) and [ f.2](b ) suggest that an enhancement of @xmath0 by thermal annealing is common to different _ moderately _ disordered metals .",
    "( we notice that the high resistivities in sb films arise from a low carrier concentration instead of a short electron mean free path @xcite .",
    "our sb thick films are thus moderately disordered . )",
    "one of the widely accepted explanations for the  saturation \" behavior of @xmath3 invokes magnetic spin - spin scattering due to a low level contamination of the sample .",
    "this explanation has been challenged in several recent careful experiments @xcite . however , despite this experimental situation , there is still an insisting opinion that argues for non - zero magnetic scattering in the sample .",
    "to completely reject such an opinion is non - trivial , because it is argued that the level of unintentional contamination is so low that it can not be detected by the state - of - the - art material analysis techniques .",
    "the situation becomes more serious when reduced - dimensional systems are involved . in the case of low - dimensional structures , surface effects due to interfaces , substrates , and paramagnetic oxidation",
    "are non - negligible .",
    "therefore , it is not straightforward to ascribe the observed saturation of @xmath3 to either intrinsic material properties or surface / interface effects . on the other hand ,",
    "this kind of ambiguity does _ not _ occur in our _ three - dimensional _ measurements .",
    "in fact , we believe that magnetic scattering can at most play a subdominant role in our experiment .",
    "our reasons are given as follows .",
    "( i ) suppose that there is a low level of magnetic contamination in our as - sputtered films . upon annealing , the magnetic impurity concentration @xmath17 should be left unchanged .",
    "if the original  saturation \" in our as - sputtered samples is caused by spin - spin scattering , one should then expect the same value of @xmath3 ( @xmath32 ) after annealing .",
    "however , we find increasing @xmath3 with annealing .",
    "our result is thus in disagreement with this assumption .",
    "( ii ) our argument for a non - magnetic origin is supported by the observation of an _ increased _",
    "@xmath3 in the aged and annealed sb films .",
    "since our sb01b and sb12 thick films were aged in air for two years , one might have naively expected a large decrease in @xmath3 due to magnetic contamination . nevertheless , this is not the case found in fig .",
    "[ f.2](b ) .",
    "( iii ) moreover , if our samples do contain an appreciable level of unintentional magnetic impurities , the contaminated concentration @xmath17 should be basically the same in all films , because similar fabrication and measurement procedures were involved .",
    "one should then expect a similar @xmath3 in all _ as - prepared _",
    "samples , regardless of disorder .",
    "this is certainly inconsistent with the observed scaling relation @xmath33 discussed above .",
    "therefore , magnetic scattering in its current form can not easily explain our overall results in a consistent manner .    in order to explain the widely observed saturation behavior of @xmath3 ,",
    "it has recently been proposed that dynamical defects can be important @xcite .",
    "the low - energy excitations of the dynamical defects are usually modelled by two - level systems .",
    "we already discussed that tls might be partly responsible for the saturated dephasing found in our moderately disordered films .",
    "however , it is impossible to perform a quantitative comparison of our experiment with the tls theories .",
    "the difficulties lie on the facts that ( i ) the number concentration of tls in a particular sample is not known , ( ii ) the strength of coupling between conduction electrons and a tls is poorly understood , and ( iii ) the dynamical properties of real defects ( impurities , grain boundaries , etc . ) are even less clear .",
    "experimentally , we also find other features of thermal annealing ( fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] ) that seem incompatible with a tls picture of dephasing .",
    "in addition to the moderately disordered samples , we have performed measurements on thick films containing much higher levels of disorder .",
    "surprisingly , we discover that the effect of annealing is completely different . in the _ strongly _ disordered aupd4a and aupd5e thick films",
    ", we find that annealing causes _ negligible _ effect on @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ f.3 ] shows the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath5 for the as - prepared and annealed aupd4a thick film .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates that the values of @xmath0 for the as - prepared and annealed samples are essentially the same , even though the resistance , and hence diffusion constant @xmath27 changed by a factor of more than 6 .",
    "the absence of an appreciable annealing effect in this case implies that , in addition to the usual tls addressed above , these two films contain other defects that can not be readily cured by thermal annealing .",
    "such a null effect of annealing seems to suggest that , despite a large effort in this direction , no real defects of any nature can be found to have dynamical properties that may explain the saturation behavior of @xmath3 . a comparison of figs .",
    "[ f.2 ] and [ f.3 ] strongly indicates that low - temperature dephasing is very sensitive to the microstructures .",
    "the observation of fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] deserves further discussion .",
    "first , we recall that our measured @xmath0 in the as - sputtered , strongly ( and moderately ) disordered films follows the scaling relation of @xmath33 mentioned above @xcite , implying that the result of fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] is material intrinsic .",
    "secondly , in the context of magnetic scattering , blachly and giordano recently found that kondo effect is very _ sensitive _ to disorder , namely , an increase in disorder suppresses kondo effect @xcite .",
    "along this line , if the original saturated @xmath3 found in fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] were due to magnetic scattering , one should argue that thermal annealing that suppresses disorder should enhance kondo effect .",
    "then , a decreased @xmath3 should be expected with annealing . since our @xmath3 does not change even when the sample resistivity is reduced by a factor of more than 6 by annealing , fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] thus can not be easily reconciled with a magnetic scattering scenario .",
    "besides , this picture of a weakened kondo effect by disorder is also incompatible with our result for the moderately disordered films ( fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] ) where an increased , instead of a decreased , @xmath3 with annealing is found .",
    "thirdly , one might argue that annealing in the presence of oxygen can lead to the oxidation of magnetic impurities , and hence to the disappearance of kondo resistivity @xcite .",
    "we argue that this is unlikely in our case , since we had taken precautions by annealing our films in a 99.999% pure ar atmosphere , where the amount of oxygen residual gas was greatly minimized .",
    "moreover , since we do not find a rapid increase in the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath3 after annealing , there is thus no clear evidence of the presence of oxygen or magnetic impurities in our films . in any case , it would be interesting to study if annealing in oxygen would have a drastic effect on @xmath3 .",
    "lastly , we discuss the advantage of using three- , instead of lower - dimensional , mesoscopic structures for @xmath0 measurements . in 3d ,",
    "the dominating inelastic process is the electron - phonon scattering for which @xmath34 obeys a strong @xmath35 ( 2 @xmath23 4 ) dependence @xcite .",
    "such a temperature variation is much stronger than the dominating @xmath36 in one dimension and @xmath37 in two dimensions ( which are both due to electron - electron scattering @xcite ) .",
    "inspection of the solid lines , which are drawn proportional to @xmath38 , in figs .",
    "[ f.1 ] and [ f.3 ] reveals that our measured @xmath3 at 0.3 k is already @xmath11 _ two orders of magnitude _ lower than that as would be extrapolated from the measured @xmath34 at a few degrees kelvin .",
    "such a huge discrepancy is well outside any experimental uncertainties . on the contrary ,",
    "in the case of narrow wires , the dominating inelastic dephasing time obeys a much weaker @xmath39 law just mentioned . in this case , any discrepancy between the measured and extrapolated values of @xmath3 would be less dramatic in the attainable experimental temperature range , rendering a discrimination of the presence or absence of a saturated @xmath3 less clear - cut .",
    "we have studied the influence of thermal annealing on low - temperature electron dephasing in polycrystalline aupd and sb thick films .",
    "we find that @xmath3 reveals an extremely weak temperature dependence in both as - sputtered and annealed samples .",
    "the effect of annealing is non - universal , depending strongly on the amount of disorder quenched in the microstructures during deposition .",
    "the observed saturation behavior of @xmath3 can not be easily explained by magnetic - scattering in its current form .",
    "we also find that the disorder behavior of @xmath3 in as - prepared and annealed samples is very different .",
    "a complete theoretical explanation would need to take the microstructures into account .",
