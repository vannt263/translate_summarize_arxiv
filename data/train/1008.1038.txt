    "mixtures of polymers with different compositions are of great interest for many technological and industrial applications .",
    "for example , multicomponent polymer mixtures facilitate the custom tailoring of desired physical properties , leading to the creation of new materials with enhanced performance.@xcite however , since new materials are typically processed in their liquid phase , the ability to predict the mixing behavior of various polymer composites is a desirable computational task . because of the underlying phase diagram , polymer mixtures can phase separate at specific thermodynamic conditions of temperature and polymer volume fraction . the structure and dynamics of each component strongly depends on the region of the phase diagram that is explored , and different length scales characterize the thermodynamic and dynamical behavior of the mixture , depending on how far the system is from its phase separation .    while computer simulations are useful in elucidating the structural and dynamic complexity of these systems , they are limited in the extent of information that can be collected by the precision of the calculation , which degrades with the number of simulation steps , and by the power of the available computational machines.@xcite already for polymer liquids it is not possible to collect all the relevant information from a single simulation when long polymers are involved , as information spreads over many order of magnitude in time and length , going from the monomer length scale , @xmath1 , to the overall polymer dimension of the radius - of - gyration , @xmath2 .",
    "the latter scales as the square root of the degree of polymerization , @xmath3 , which can be fairly large for polymers of interest.@xcite the added complexity of dealing with polymer mixtures arises from the presence of a new length scale of concentration fluctuations , @xmath4 , which diverges as the system approaches its spinodal curve .",
    "the big challenge for such systems becomes simulating the mixtures not only at different temperatures and compositions , but also with a box size that increases with the scale of concentration fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the equilibration step in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations becomes extremely slow , as the time scale in which polymer mixtures phase separate diverges as the temperature approaches the critical point .",
    "finally the timescale of relaxation of the mixture depends on the proximity of the system to the glass transition of its components . in conclusion , classical md simulations of polymer mixtures",
    "have been limited so far to high temperatures close to the athermal limit . in that region",
    "the thermodynamic behavior is mainly guided by entropy and local packing@xcite , while enthalpic effects may be accounted for within a high temperature perturbative framework.@xcite    in order to extend the ability of md simulations to make quantitative predictions about polymer blends at temperatures approaching the spinodal , information is needed on multiple length - scales of interest . as the system approaches its phase transition and the largest length scale of interest diverges , one might be tempted to neglect the details of the local scale ; however , such a procedure risks losing pertinent information , since the monomeric structure of a blend s component largely determines its glass transition temperature , as well as the shape of its phase diagram .",
    "nonetheless , capturing the global structure is equally as important since an accurate determination of the thermodynamics of the system requires obtaining the total distribution of particles in the ensemble .",
    "for example , while system - specific local information is contained within the correlation hole region of the pair distribution function , g(r ) , the global structure is still required , as truncation of g(r ) will prevent accurate fourier transform to the structure factor where the low k limit is important.@xcite thus , both local and global scale information need to be accounted for to achieve a complete thermodynamic and dynamic description of the mixture .",
    "one strategy to improve our ability to simulate mixtures of complex fluids and collect information on an increasingly large range of length scales is to use a hierarchical approach , such as the multiscale modeling procedure that we present in this paper . in such a multiscaling scheme",
    "the system of interest is represented at various levels of coarse - graining and simulations are performed for each of these coarse - grained representations to enhance computational efficiency . in a second step , the information obtained from those simulations is collected and combined into a complete description , bridging information at all the length scales of interest.@xcite    for any coarse - grained model to be capable of faithfully reproducing the desired characteristics of the system , the coarse level of description needs to include the essential features of the atomistic structure while averaging out the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "several coarse - graining procedures have been developed in the literature at various levels of  coarseness \" . at the lowest level ,",
    "the united atom ( ua ) description , which represents groups of @xmath5 units , with @xmath6 , or @xmath7 into an effective ua along the chain , is a particularly useful representation , for which potentials have been optimized to reproduce the structure for most polyolefins.@xcite higher levels of structure - based approaches simplify interactions , while remaining close to the chemical structure , facilitating scale hopping between the different levels@xcite ; however , these methods remain computationally demanding and do not adopt an extreme enough level of coarse - graining to mitigate the limitations of fully atomistic simulations in reaching the large length scales of phase separation.@xcite in order to simulate the increasingly large scale phenomena of interest to material scientists , an even coarser level of description is needed , while remaining formally related to the finer structure .",
    "the highest level of coarse - graining in our procedure , represents each polymer chain as a soft colloidal particle , centered at the polymer center - of - mass .",
    "soft colloids interact through a gaussian - like repulsive potential of the order of the polymer radius - of - gyration , @xmath8 , which defines the characteristic length scale of this description .",
    "large - scale behavior is easily generated in a ",
    "mesoscale \" simulation of the coarse - grained , mixture and information is collected on a scale equal to or larger than the polymer radius - of - gyration .",
    "recently , we have shown that our mesoscale simulations capture the global structure of the polymer mixture providing information over much of the miscible region of the phase diagram.@xcite    much attention has been given recently to relating mesoscopic@xcite or field - theoretical model parameters@xcite to their more detailed atomistic representation .",
    "for example , groot and warren were able to express the repulsive soft potential parameters used in dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) in terms of the flory - huggins @xmath0 parameter , providing a bridge between dpd simulations and atomistic simulations , from which solubility parameters can be directly calculated.@xcite this method has been successfully implemented in mesoscale simulations of biological membranes once the model is parameterized for specific molecular structures.@xcite in our approach , the effective @xmath0 parameter is included directly in the model as an input parameter which determines the length scale of the of concentration fluctuations .",
    "this @xmath0 parameter provides a convenient link between an atomistic or united atom level description and a mesoscale picture , similar to other mesoscale modeling approaches;@xcite however , our approach has the advantage over other methods such as dpd in that the soft - core potential depends directly on the @xmath0 parameter and not on any phenomenological expression to bridge the two theories . in other words ,",
    "once the @xmath0 parameter is specified , our multiscale modeling procedure will produce the expected phase behavior@xcite , and the task in practice is to determine this parameter for a given model .    in the current paper , we focus on bridging the length scales of binary homopolymer mixtures of different chemical architecture to provide a complete description of the static structure of the blend under a given set of thermodynamic conditions . blends of polyolefins represent a good test case for our procedure since united atom parameters have been well optimized for these systems , and they provide a stringent test of the method , as subtle differences in chemical architecture , such as the extent of branching , greatly affects the global structure and miscibility .",
    "one advantage of our coarse - graining and multiscale modeling approaches is that since they are based on the formalism of the ornstein - zernike equation , the rescaling of the structure to recover the monomer level of description is straightforward .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the correct dynamics can be obtained directly from simulations of the coarse - grained structures by proper rescaling.@xcite thus , by performing simulations of mesoscopic particles and subsequently reinserting the relevant chemical details afterwards , we are able to obtain _ quantitative _ information about large - scale properties .    large scale information , obtained form mesoscale md simulations , is later combined with local - scale united - atom simulations of the same system , using a multiscale formalism obtained from the solution of the ornstein - zernike equation , presented in this paper . in a spirit similar to the united atom simulations",
    "to which we test our approach , we initially take the high temperature limit as a reference state , and set @xmath9 in order to calculate monomer level total correlation functions .",
    "the model is then extended to incorporate thermal effects on the concentration fluctuation through the interaction parameter , @xmath0 , which serves to bridge the gap between mesoscale and atomistic models .",
    "this multiscale modeling approach , is an extension to polymer mixtures of our coarse - graining and multiscale modeling procedure for polymer melts.@xcite by comparison with united atom simulations of polymer mixtures , our approach shows good agreement between the two descriptions .",
    "furthermore , our procedure has the advantage of being analytically solved , so that thermodynamic parameters defining the free energy potential appear explicitly in the formalism , making the whole procedure general and transferible to other systems in different thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the key advantage of our method lies in the fact that it provides a quantitative picture of how the local details such as the specific chemical architecture and thermodynamic conditions are connected to the observed , global properties .",
    "while atomistic and united atom simulations are limited in the maximum length scale that can be simulated , our approach easily provides information on a wide range of length scales , once mesoscale simulations are combined with atomistic or monomer level simulations .",
    "the number of test systems presented in the paper is determined by the available united - atom simulations against which our procedure is tested ; however , our procedure is directly applicable to other mixtures as well .",
    "while the focus here is on the equilibrium structural properties of simple polyolefins , it is worth noting that many interesting systems could be investigated through our method and important problems approached .",
    "for example , the proposed multiscale procedure could be applied to study various aspects of binary blends , including critical behavior , mechanical properties and viscosity , the effects of non - random mixing , stiffness disparity , shape disparity , and different architectures , as well as the dynamics of demixing at equilibrium and under shear , interdiffusion in equilibrium and during phase separation , and the different propensity for crystallization in the dynamics of miscible blends approaching the phase transition .",
    "as one of the polymers in the mixture crystalizes it is important to investigate , for example , the kinetics of interface formation and structure .",
    "additionally the procedure could be extended to encompass mixtures including block and homo - copolymers , blends close to surfaces and in thin films , and mixtures of colloids and polymers .",
    "although the dynamics of coarse - grained systems is unrealistically accelerated , we have recently proposed a new first - principle method to rescale the dynamics of the coarse - grained system to its atomistic value , enabling dynamical properties of these systems to be investigated with quantitative precision.@xcite this method can be useful in evaluating long - time dynamics directly from the mesoscale simulation .",
    "the paper begins with a brief overview of the theory for coarse - graining of polymer blends , from which we calculate the effective potential , @xmath10 , input to the mesocale molecular dynamic simulations of the coarse - grained system .",
    "mesoscale simulations of the coarse - grained polymer mixture , where chains are represented as soft colloidal particles , are presented in the following section .",
    "those simulations provide the large - scale information , which is combined with local - scale united - atom simulations by means of our multiscale modeling procedure .",
    "next , we present our results in the form of the total correlation function , @xmath11 with @xmath12 for each pair of components , which is predicted and compared with data of full united - atom simulations .",
    "first , we present correlation functions of the mixture in the limit where * @xmath9 * to demonstrate the tenor of our scale bridging approach .",
    "this is followed by an extension of the model to include finite temperature effects , where we present the change in the concentration structure factor upon inclusion of realistic values for the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "a brief discussion concludes the paper .",
    "an analytical coarse graining procedure for binary polymer blends was derived by yatsenko , _ _ et al.__@xcite , to formally map the blend onto a mixture of soft - colloidal particles . here , we briefly review the results of that work .",
    "the polymer species ( a and b ) in the blend are characterized by a radius of gyration , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , a total density of monomers , @xmath15 , and a segment length @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the number of chain units . the volume fraction of the a component is given by @xmath20 and the ratio of segment lengths is given by @xmath21 .",
    "the main physical quantity of interest in the study of complex liquids , is the pair distribution function , or the related total correlation function , as from this quantity any thermodynamic property of interest can be directly calculated.@xcite here the total correlation function has contributions from three terms : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , representing the three types on interaction of a mixture of particles a and b. analytical expressions for the total correlation functions at the coarse grained level are obtained by solving a generalized ornstein - zernike ( oz ) matrix relation    @xmath25 \\ , \\label{eq : blnd1}\\ ] ]    where * h*(k ) is the matrix of total intermolecular partial correlation functions ( pcfs ) , * c*(k ) is the matrix of direct pcfs , and @xmath26 represents the matrix of intramolecular pcfs .",

    "the derivation of equation [ eq : blnd2 ] is an extension of the procedure outlined by krakoviack , _ _ et al.__@xcite for homopolymers and formally connects the center of mass ( cm ) distribution functions to monomer - monomer ( mm ) distribution functions .",
    "both the intramolecular form factors in equation [ eq : blnd2 ] , namely the monomer - monomer @xmath33 and the monomer - cm @xmath34 , are expressed in analytical forms.@xcite yatsenko , _ et al . _",
    "introduced a new analytical form for the monomer total correlation functions , @xmath35 by extending the prism - blend thread model of tang and schweizer@xcite to include asymmetries in local chemical structure and flexibility.@xcite    following this procedure , analytical forms of @xmath36 , coarse - grained at the cm level , can be calculated from equation [ eq : blnd2 ] . in real space",
    "they are given by : @xmath37 with @xmath38 \\nonumber \\",
    ",   \\label{eq : blnd4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the average correlation hole length scale , and @xmath41 is an average radius - of - gyration . here",
    ", @xmath42 identifies the length scale for the density and concentration fluctuation correlations .",
    "the concentration fluctuation of a polymer blend is defined as @xmath43 where we introduce the miscibility parameter @xmath0 for which the quantity @xmath44 is analogous to the flory - huggins interaction parameter@xcite such that @xmath45 .",
    "the concentration fluctuation , @xmath4 , diverges at the spinodal temperature where @xmath46 .",
    "the average segment length is @xmath47 , while the density fluctuation , @xmath48 , is defined as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "although for compressible blends , there is , in principle , more than one @xmath0 parameter resulting from the distinct partial osmotic compressibilities of a two component blend@xcite , in this work we adopt a single interaction parameter which determines the length scale of concentration fluctuations .",
    "the choice of a single adjustable parameter is appropriate in this case , since the aim is to obtain quantitative agreement with experiment , and the adoption of a single  effective \" @xmath0 maintains a straightforward connection to sans experiments .",
    "the notion of extracting a single effective @xmath0 parameter was also invoked dudowicz",
    "_ et al . _ in a general lattice cluster theory analysis of compressible blends,@xcite and by schweizer in connecting the prism blend approach with methods used in experimental sans analysis.@xcite while we initially set @xmath9 , the extension to more realistic models is achieved by using the experimental @xmath0 parameter within this general framework , which has been shown to represent well both upper and lower critical phase diagrams.@xcite results presented in section iii b of this paper are examples of both kinds of systems . in the athermal regime , however , the theory is presently being implemented to reproduce quantitatively and in a self - consistent way , the experimental values of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted that here we are only interested in capturing the global structure and thus the use of the simple analytic prism thread result is adequate as it accurately captures the structure of the polymer at distances greater the @xmath8 and correctly predicts the correlation hole . while the prism thread result does not capture local effects such as solvation shells , such detail is not relevant at the coarse - grained level since at this level , local interactions are averaged out .",
    "local packing in the structural g(r ) is introduced later using the multiscale modeling procedure discussed later , where local scale information from ua md simulations is paired with global information obtained from course - grained simulations .    by adopting the hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) closure relation , the effective pair interaction potential , @xmath52 ,",
    "is connected to the pcfs by the relationship @xmath53 - c^{cc}_{\\alpha \\beta}(r ) \\ , \\label{eq : blnd7}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the direct pcf for a mixture of soft colloidal particles , defined in reciprocal space as @xmath55 the chain density , @xmath56 , of chain type , a , is given as @xmath57 , and for chain type , b , as @xmath58 .",
    "for a binary mixture the static structure factors , @xmath59 , are given by    @xmath60    where the total chain density @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ^ 2 $ ] is the determinant of the mesoscopic static structure factor matrix .",
    "whereas at the monomer level of description , molecular closures are required to ensure the correct scaling of the @xmath0 parameter@xcite , the use of the site level hnc is appropriate here because at this level of coarse - graining , the polymers are treated as a simple liquid of soft - colloids.@xcite    by inserting equations [ eq : blnd3.1 ] and [ eq : blnd8 ] into equation [ eq : blnd7 ] , the effective pair potentials are calculated , which are input to the mesocale simulations of the coarse grained binary mixture .",
    "the potential so obtained explicitly depends on the structural parameters of the polymer , such as @xmath15 , @xmath3 , @xmath20 , and @xmath8 .",
    "since these parameters enter into the ua description , they do not represent additional parameters needed in moving to a higher level of coarse - graining .",
    "in other words , the potential is state dependent , being a free energy obtained from the monomer frame of reference ; however , it is fully transferable to different systems since it is analytically derived in a well - defined manner .",
    "in addition to these structural parameters , there is the additional parameter , @xmath0 , that enters into the mesoscale description through equation [ eq : blnd6 ] , and describes the monomer - specific interactions that drive phase separation .",
    "once these parameters are defined , mesoscale simulations may be performed and structural properties calculated for any system of interest .      in continuing our multi - scaling approach , mesoscale simulations ( ms ) of various binary polymer mixtures with @xmath9 were performed using the effective potential calculated in the previous section .",
    "these simulations provide a reference system representative of the case in which the blend is well mixed and fluctuations are small .",
    "systems investigated were blends of polyethylene ( pe ) , polyisobutylene ( pib ) , and polypropylenes in their head - to - head ( hhpp ) , isotactic ( ipp ) , and syndiotactic ( spp ) forms .",
    "table [ tb:1 ] shows the simulation parameters used in both ua and ms descriptions for each polyolefin blend studied .",
    ".simulation parameters for polyolefin blends ( @xmath63 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally we note that much work has been done using the prism theory of schweizer and curro to determine both the qualitative and quantitative miscibility behavior of polymer blends.@xcite for polyolefin blends of the type investigated here , realistic models utilizing prism expressions for the pair distribution function along with ua potential parameters have been shown to give reasonable estimates of @xmath0 for various polypropylene and polyethylene blends.@xcite ; however this approach is not pursued further here since the purpose of the current publication is to demonstrate the implementation of the multiscale modeling procedure once the @xmath0 parameter is obtained .",
    "in this paper we present a multiscale modeling procedure to simulate mixtures of polymer chains at large scales .",
    "the method is completely general and applies to mixtures of polymers with different molecular structures , at different thermodynamic conditions of temperature , mixture composition , and chain length .",
    "the procedure combines large - scale information from a mesoscale simulation with a more detailed model which captures the local structure of the blend . for the detailed model",
    ", we use a united atom representation which captures the local polymer structure .",
    "our mesoscale model represents the blend as a mixture of soft colloidal particles and accurately describes the large - scale structure as exhibited in the center of mass radial distribution function .",
    "once the mesoscale simulations are performed , the relevant chemical details are reinserted by implementation of the ornstein - zernike formalism .",
    "we then combine this information with short united atom simulations to obtain a complete description over all length scales of interest . in this article",
    "we test the approach by applying our method to several different polyolefin mixtures .",
    "we check the validity of our procedure by direct comparison of the pair correlation function against full united atom molecular dynamic simulations .",
    "because the ua - md simulations available for comparison are limited to high temperatures where the samples can be more easily equilibrated , the test of our procedure includes only high temperature samples .",
    "however our mesoscale simulations are easily performed at temperatures approaching the demixing temperature .",
    "furthermore , the multiscale modeling procedure provides a straightforward method to circumvent large simulations when modeling thermal mixtures , which has the potential to extend the range currently available to computer simulations of polymers . at low temperatures , where equilibration of even the local ua - md simulation may be difficult ,",
    "our two step procedure could be implemented  on the fly \" where information is transferred from the local ua - md ( which provides the packing information ) to the global scale ms - md and vice versa until consistency between the two is reached .",
    "one advantage of the proposed method is that no optimized parameterization scheme is required to maintain consistency between the different levels of description .",
    "the approach is thus transferable to different systems and different conditions , while remaining quantitative enough to distinguish even subtle differences in chemical structure . considering the advantages of the proposed multiscale approach",
    ", it should provide an important tool for investigating the dynamics of large - scale phenomena via md simulation .",
    "future work should focus on performing simulations of large systems approaching the spinodal where full ua md simulations are prohibitively difficult .",

    "<S> obtaining a rigorous and reliable method for linking computer simulations of polymer blends and composites at different length scales of interest is a highly desirable goal in soft matter physics . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> a multiscale modeling procedure is presented for the efficient calculation of the static structural properties of binary homopolymer blends . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure combines computer simulations of polymer chains on two different length scales , using a united atom representation for the finer structure and a highly coarse - grained approach on the meso - scale , where chains are represented as soft colloidal particles interacting through an effective potential . a method for combining the structural information by inverse mapping </S>",
    "<S> is discussed , allowing for the efficient calculation of partial correlation functions , which are compared with results from full united atom simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of several polymer mixtures is obtained in an efficient manner for several mixtures in the homogeneous region of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the method is then extended to incorporate thermal fluctuations through an effective @xmath0 parameter . </S>",
    "<S> since the approach is analytical , it is fully transferable to numerous systems . </S>"
