    "haglund and wise s definition of a _ special cube complex _",
    "@xcite has had profound ramifications in geometric group theory and low - dimensional topology , most notably agol s solution to the virtually haken conjecture @xcite .",
    "a compact , non - positively curved cube complex is _ special _ if it admits a local isometry to the canonical cube complex associated to a right - angled artin group . when phrased thus ,",
    "this is not a condition that one expects to be able to check in a practical manner , given a compact cube complex @xmath0 .",
    "but haglund and wise proved that it is equivalent to a purely combinatorial condition , namely one just has to check that each of the finitely many hyperplanes in @xmath0 should not behave in one of a small number of forbidden ways : a hyperplane should not cross itself , it should be 2-sided , it should not self - osculate , and it should not inter - osculate with another hyperplane ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we say that a hyperplane is _",
    "clean _ if it does not exhibit any of these forbidden behaviours .",
    "given the combinatorial nature of these conditions , it is easy to check if a given hyperplane is clean and hence whether a given compact cube complex is special or not .",
    "however , in applications , it is not specialness that matters so much as _ virtual specialness _ : a cube complex is virtualy special if it has a finite - sheeted covering space that is special .",
    "agol @xcite has promoted the study of the following :    [ qu : vs decidable ] is there an algorithm that , given a finite , non - positively curved cube complex , will determine whether or not that complex is virtually special ?    this is equivalent to the question :    [ qu : vs decidable ] is there an algorithm that , given a finite , non - positively curved cube complex @xmath0 ( whose hyperplanes are @xmath2 , say ) , will determine the existence of a finite - sheeted covering @xmath3 in which each lift of each @xmath4 is clean .",
    "one has to think clearly for a moment to see that this question is not equivalent to :    [ qu : finite collection ] is there an algorithm that , given a finite , non - positively curved cube complex @xmath0 and a collection of hyperplanes @xmath2 , will determine the existence of a finite - sheeted covering @xmath3 in which each lift of each @xmath4 is clean .",
    "one s first thought is that a positive solution to question 1@xmath5 should proceed via a positive solution to question [ qu : finite collection ] .",
    "but on reflection one realises that a the latter would be signficantly more powerful , because certain of the complexes @xmath0 for which one did establish the existence of @xmath6 would not be virtually special .",
    "focussing on this difference , we shall prove the following theorem by exploiting our recent work on the triviality problem for profinite completions @xcite .",
    "there does not exist an algorithm that , given a finite , non - positively curved cube complex @xmath0 and a hyperplane @xmath1 in @xmath0 , can determine whether or not there exists a finite - sheeted covering @xmath3 in which each lift of @xmath1 is clean .    note that this theorem is equivalent to the corresponding statement with ` each ' replaced by ` some ' :",
    "this is clear if @xmath3 is normal , and since the lift of a clean hyperplane is clean , we are free to pass to a finite - sheeted normal covering .",
    "the obstruction to cleanness that we focus on is self - osculation .",
    "our construction shows that the question of whether one can remove self - osculations in finite - sheeted covers is already undecidable in dimension 2 , and this is the context in which we shall work for the remainder of this paper .",
    "although this theorem does not settle question [ qu : vs decidable ] , it strongly constrains the nature of any possible positive solution : a putative recognition algorithm would have to take account of all the hyperplanes of @xmath0 simultaneously .",
    "we therefore believe that question [ qu : vs decidable ] has a negative solution :    virtual specialness is an undecidable property of non - positively curved cube complexes .",
    "rather than working with non - positively curved cube complexes in full generality , we restrict attention to the class of _ @xmath7-complexes_.    a square complex is _ @xmath7",
    "_ if there is a partition of the edges of the 1-skeleton into _ vertical _ and _ horizontal _ subgraphs , such that the boundary cycle of each 2-cell crosses vertical and horizontal edges alternately .",
    "we refer the reader to for the basic theory of @xmath7-complexes , but we recall some salient facts here . in common with all cube complexes , much of the geometry of a @xmath7-complex @xmath0 is encoded in its set of _ hyperplanes _ @xmath8 .",
    "( a hyperplane is a maximal connected union of midcubes . )",
    "we are concerned with certain regularity hypotheses on the hyperplanes .",
    "let @xmath9 be a hyperplane embedded in a @xmath7-complex @xmath0 .",
    "the union of all the open cells intersecting @xmath9 , together with the closest - point projection map , defines a bundle @xmath10 with fibre @xmath11 , which has a natural completion to an @xmath12-bundle denoted by @xmath13 equipped with a map @xmath14 extending the inclusion of @xmath15 into @xmath0 . if @xmath16 is a trivial bundle then @xmath9 is called _ non - singular _ ( or _ 2-sided _ ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath17 $ ] , and the two maps @xmath18 for @xmath19 , are called the _ pushing maps _ associated to @xmath9 .",
    "the hyperplane @xmath9 is called _",
    "clean _ if the pushing maps @xmath20 are both embeddings .",
    "if every hyperplane is non - singular then the complex @xmath0 is _ non - singular _ , and if every hyperplane is clean then the whole complex @xmath0 is called _ clean_. in fact , in the case of @xmath7-complexes this condition also suffices to rule out inter - osculation , as demonstrated by the following theorem of haglund and wise .",
    "* theorem 5.7 ) a @xmath7-complex is virtually special if and only if it is virtually clean .",
    "thus , we may specialize question [ qu : vs decidable ] to the case of @xmath7-complexes as follows .",
    "[ qu : vc decidable ] is there an algorithm that decides whether or not a given finite @xmath7-complex is virtually clean ?    as in the introduction , our focus here is a _ local _ version of this question .",
    "we call a hyperplane @xmath9 in a @xmath7-complex @xmath0 _ virtually clean _ if there exists a finite - sheeted covering map @xmath21 and each connected component @xmath22 such that the hyperplane @xmath23 of @xmath24 is clean",

    "the complexes @xmath25 that we shall construct to prove theorem [ thm : main theorem ] are never ( globally ) virtually clean  indeed , @xmath29 is not residually finite  so they are not themselves candidates to answer question [ qu : vc decidable ] .",

    "there is a natural continuous map @xmath53 , with the property that every homomorphism from @xmath54 to a finite group factors through @xmath55 ; 3 .   for any choice of base point in @xmath44 ,",
    "the concatenation @xmath56 is surjective .    to prove ( 1 ) , we subdivide the copies of @xmath33 and @xmath44 so that the attaching maps of the cylinders have the same length at either end .",
    "the gluing cylinders can then be subdivided into squares , giving the whole space the structure of a square complex , which is obviously @xmath7 .    the map @xmath57 is defined to crush each copy of @xmath33 to a point ; since a cylinder with one end identified with a point is homeomorphic to a disc , the resulting space is homeomorphic to @xmath9 .",
    "the kernel of @xmath55 is normally generated by the copies of @xmath33 . since @xmath37 has no finite quotients , if @xmath58 is a homomorphism from @xmath54 to a finite group , then @xmath58 kills the conjugacy classes defined by the loops in each copy of @xmath33 , and therefore factors through @xmath55 .",
