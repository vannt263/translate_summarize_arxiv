    "the finding that intermediate - age star clusters in the magellanic clouds exhibit a bimodal or extended main - sequence turn off ( emsto ) is one of the most intriguing discoveries in the field of stellar populations of the last decade ( e.g.bertelli et al.2003 ; baume et al.2007 ; mackey & broby nielsen2007 ; glatt et al.2008 ; goudfrooij et al.2011 ; keller et al.2012 ; rubele et al.2013 ) .",
    "high - accuracy photometry with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) has revealed that the emsto is a common feature among the @xmath01 - 2 gyr - old mcs clusters as it has been detected in most of the objects studied so far ( milone et al.2009  hereafter paperi  ; goudfrooij et al.2014 ) .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the emsto is that these stellar systems have experienced an extended star - formation history with a duration of @xmath0100 - 500 myr ( e.g.mackey et al.2008 ; paperi ; goudfrooij et al.2009 , 2014 ) . as an alternative explanation , bastian & de mink(2009 ) and yang et al.(2011 , 2013 )",
    "have suggested that stellar rotation or interacting binaries can mimic an age spread and could be responsible for the emsto ( but see girardi et al.2011 and platais et al.2012 ) .",
    "noticeably , there is no evidence for prolonged star formation in clusters younger than @xmath01 gyr although age spreads have been searched in a large number of young massive clusters with different techniques ( larsen et al.2011 ; milone et al.2013  hereafter paperii  ; bastian & silva - villa2013 ; bastian et al.2013 ; niederhofer et al.2015 ) .",
    "the properties of the progenitors of the clusters where we observe emsto have been widely studied by bekki & mackey(2009 ) and keller et al.(2011 ) in the context of a prolonged star - formation history .",
    "a sufficiently large mass should enable a cluster , in principle , to retain ejecta from a previous stellar generation which polluted the gas from which the second generation can form .",
    "this possibility implies that the mass of the progenitor should have been of the order of @xmath2 at the time of cluster formation .",
    "keller et al.(2011 ) concluded that ngc1856 in the large magellanic cloud , with a mass of @xmath3 ( mackey & gilmore2003 ) and an age of @xmath0300 myr ( bastian & silva - villa2013 ) is the only cluster with measured age and mass close to that of an emsto progenitor .",
    "ngc1856 has been previously studied by bastian & silva - villa(2013 ) who have analyzed wide - field - planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) photometry from brocato et al.(2001 ) and found an age of 280 myr and no evidence for an emsto and an age spread . in this paper",
    "we exploit a new dataset , which consists of multi - wavelength images collected with the ultraviolet and visual channel of the wide field camera 3 ( uvis / wfc3 ) on board of _ hst _ , to further investigate ngc1856 in the context of multiple stellar populations .",
    "the dataset used in this paper is summarized in table  [ tab : data ] and consists of images collected with uvis / wfc3 through five filters that cover a wavelength range from the ultraviolet to @xmath08100  . the poor charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) in the uvis",
    "/ wfc3 images have been corrected by using a software written by jay anderson following the recipe by anderson & bedin(2010 ) .",
    "photometry and astrometry of the images have been carried out with a software program mostly based on the anderson et al.(2008 ) software adapted to uvis / wfc3 by jay anderson .",
    "briefly , we used two distinct methods to infer luminosity and position of bright and faint stars .",
    "astrometry and photometry of bright stars have been performed independently in each image by using the best point - spread function ( psf ) model available , and later combined . for that purpose ,",
    "we used library psf by anderson et al.(in preparation ) and accounted for small focus variations due to the ` breathing ' of _ hst _ by deriving a spatially - constant perturbation for each exposure . the flux and the position of each very faint stars can be determined more robustly by simultaneously fitting all the pixels in all the exposures .",
    "moreover , we adopted the solution of bellini & bedin ( 2009 ) and bellini , anderson & bedin(2011 ) to correct stellar positions for geometrical distortion .",
    "the photometry has been calibrated as in bedin et al.(2005 ) and by using the zero points provided by the stsci web page for wfc3/uvis .",
    "since the study of multiple populations in star clusters requires high - precision photometry , we have used a number of indexes provided by the adopted software as diagnostics of photometry quality ( see anderson et al.2008 for details ) .",
    "similarly with what was done in papersi ( see their sect.2.1 ) and ii , we have limited our study of ngc1856 to a sub - sample of stars that have small astrometric errors , are relatively isolated , and well fitted by the psf .",

    "the two circles superimposed on the left - panel image have a radius of 25 arcsec and delimit a region named cluster field which is centered on ngc1856 and is mostly populated by cluster members ( green circle ) , and a reference field , where the contamination from ngc1856 stars is negligible ( yellow circle ) .",

    "a visual comparison between the observed cmd and the error bars , derived from as tests and plotted on the left , reveals that this spread can not entirely be explained by the photometric errors . in the following we investigate whether this broadening is intrinsic or",
    "can be due to differential reddening , spatial variation of the photometric zero point across the field of view , field stars , or binaries .      in order to investigate the effect of differential reddening on the msto of ngc1856 , in the upper - right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : reddening ] we have plotted the cmd not corrected for differential reddening for the stars located in six circular sub - regions ( i - vi ) of 25-arcsec radius . due to the small area of each region ,",
    "the variation of reddening therein is smaller than that of the entire cluster field .",
    "noticeably the color and magnitude of the msto is broadened in each cmd , thus suggesting that the young ngc1856 hosts an emsto in close analogy with intermediate - age mc clusters .    to properly address this issue ,",
    "we have corrected the photometry of stars in the cluster field for differential reddening as in milone et al.(2012 ) .",

    "[ sec : data ] .",
    "then we have determined the fiducial line of these reference stars and calculated , for each of them , the distance from the fiducial line along the reddening line .",
    "the reddening direction has been determined by using the absorption coefficient for uvis / wfc3 filters kindly provided by aaron dotter ( 2014 , private communication ) .",
    "namely these are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . as differential reddening of each star in the cluster field",
    "we assumed the median distance of the 45 closest reference stars .",
    "the uncertainty on the differential reddening has been estimated as the ratio between the dispersion of the 45 values of the distance of each reference star from the fiducial line and the square root of 44 .",
    "we have found that the reddening in the direction of ngc1856 is not uniform and ranges from @xmath12@xmath13(@xmath14)@xmath0@xmath150.05 to @xmath0@xmath160.07 with respect to the average reddening @xmath13(@xmath14)=0.15 ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : age ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4 vs.@xmath5 cmd corrected for differential reddening is shown in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : reddening ] . the error bars plotted on the left account also for the uncertainty in the differential reddening correction above estimated .",
    "the corrected photometry unveils several features in the cmd of ngc1856 .",
    "the color width of the ms , below @xmath1721.5 , is comparable to the measurement errors and a large number of binary systems is visible on the red side of the ms .",
    "the msto is widely spread in color and magnitude thus indicating that ngc1856 belongs to the class of clusters with an emsto .",
    "furthermore , we confirm previous findings by bastian et al.(2013 ) that the red clump of ngc1856 spans a wide color range and hosts two main components clustered around ( @xmath5:@xmath4)=(2.60:19.25 ) and ( 2.75:19.25 ) .    for completeness , we show the reddening map in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : reddening ] , where we also mark the sub - regions i - vi , used to derive the six cmds in the upper - right panel .          in order to investigate the msto morphology of ngc1856",
    "we have used the @xmath4 vs.@xmath18 cmd for stars in the cluster field of view corrected for differential reddening ( panel ( a@xmath19 ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : pop2 ] ) .",
    "a visual inspection of this cmd confirms that ngc1856 harbours an emsto .",
    "furthermore , the ms reveals two main components below the to , which are separated by @xmath00.1 mag at @xmath2020.0 and merge together @xmath01.5 magnitudes below .",
    "these features are highlighted by the hess diagram in panel ( a@xmath21 ) .    in the cmd of fig .",
    "[ fig : pop2]a@xmath22 we have arbitrarily selected two samples of bright msto ( bmsto ) and faint msto ( fmsto ) stars that we have colored in blue and red , respectively .",
    "moreover we have used magenta and green color codes to represent two groups of blue ms ( bms ) and red ms ( rms ) stars .    to further demonstrate that the broadened msto and the double ms are not due to differential reddening we have introduced the @xmath23 vs.(@xmath24)-1.0065 ( @xmath25 ) shown in the panel ( b@xmath26 ) of fig .",

    "the fact that the msto and the upper ms of ngc1856 are more broadened than what is expected from observational errors further demonstrates that the broadening can not be due to residual differential reddening . as noticed by the referee , the hess diagram and the pseudo - cmd of panels b@xmath30 and b@xmath31 may reveal more than two sequences . below @xmath23@xmath016.2 ,",
    "the rms and the bms are clearly visible , while at brighter luminosities , around the msto , there is some hint of a triple sequence .",
    "unfortunately the connection between the mss and the mstos is not clear from the diagrams .",
    "a visual inspection of the hess diagram of panel b@xmath30 suggests that the rms could further split into distinct mss , which evolve into the bmsto and the fmsto . in this case",
    "the bms should evolve into the bluest region of the bmsto .",
    "as an alternative the bms could cross the rms and evolve into the fmsto . in the next sect .",
    "[ subsec : age ] and  [ subsec : cno ] we will further investigate these hypothesis .      apart from observational errors , spatial variations of the photometric zero point either due to differential reddening or to small uncertainties in the psf model can broaden the sequences in the cmd and mimic multiple stellar populations ( e.g.anderson et al.2008 ) . to investigate this phenomenon , we exploit the @xmath32 vs.@xmath33 and @xmath32 vs.@xmath34 cmds and hess diagrams plotted in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pop2 ] .",
    "the comparison of the observed cmd of both panel ( c@xmath19 ) and ( d@xmath19 ) with the error bars plotted on the left reveals that the upper ms of ngc1856 is more broadened than expected from photometric errors only .    to demonstrate that this broadening is not entirely due to photometric zero - point spatial variations , in the panels ( c@xmath22 ) and ( d@xmath22 ) of fig .",

    "[ fig : pop2]a@xmath22 to represent the bmsto , fmsto , bms , and rms stars defined therein . as suggested by anderson et al.(2009 ) , if the color and magnitude broadening of the ms is entirely due to photometric errors , a star that is redder than the bulk of msto stars in @xmath18 has the same probability of being either redder or bluer in @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "instead we notice that the two groups of bmsto and fmsto stars selected in the cmd of panel ( a@xmath31 ) are also well separated in the cmds of panels ( c@xmath22 ) and ( d@xmath22 ) .",
    "this further demonstrates that the broadening of the msto can not be entirely due to measurement errors .",

    "we present the decontaminated cluster cmd to show that the observed emsto and the split ms can not be explained by field stars .",
    "the best way to derive a cmd solely made of ngc1856 stars is by separating field stars from cluster members using stellar motions .",
    "unfortunately , the short baseline of our observations coupled with the large distance of the lmc prevents us to derive proper motions that are accurate enough to reach this goal . as an alternative",
    ", we note that , due to the small size of the analyzed wfc3/uvis field of view , we can assume that the distribution of field stars is homogeneous .",
    "therefore , to investigate whether the broadened ms of ngc1856 is due to field - star contamination or not , we follow the recipe of paperi and ii and compare the cmd of stars in the cluster field and in a reference field which cover the same area as the cluster field but includes only field stars .",

    "we have demonstrated that both the split ms and the emsto can not be due to photometric errors , differential reddening , or unresolved binaries . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the emsto is a common feature of intermediate - age star clusters in the large and the small magellanic cloud although its interpretation is still controversial .",

    "we have compared the observed cmd with isochrones from the basti archive and estimated an average age of @xmath0300 myr .",
    "we have demonstrated that , if stars in ngc1856 are chemically homogeneous and the emsto is due to a prolonged star formation , the latter should have lasted @xmath0150 myr , not necessarily in a continuous way , in view of the features we observe in the upper ms and msto .",
    "specifically , the interval between the 90@xmath89 and the 10@xmath89 percentile of the age distribution corresponds to @xmath9831 myr .",
    "the age difference between the 84@xmath89 and the 16@xmath89 percentile is @xmath9922 myr . in the hypothesis that the ms and msto broadening are due to a prolonged star formation , the red ms evolves into both the faint and the bright msto , and the blue ms into the bright msto .",
    "the emsto of intermediate - age mc clusters have been interpreted either with an age spread or with stellar rotation .",
    "the idea that this feature of the cmd is due to prolonged star formation has been suggested by several authors ( e.g.mackey et al.2008 ; glatt et al.2008 ; paperi ; goudfrooij et al.2011 ) and has been recently supported by goudfrooij et al.(2014 ) on the basis of their study of 18 mc clusters .",
    "these authors have found a correlation between the msto width and the escape velocity ( @xmath100 ) of the host cluster and argued that these results are unlikely due to stellar rotation .",
    "goudfrooij et al.(2014 ) and correnti et al.(2014 ) noticed that all the analyzed clusters have @xmath101 17 km s@xmath102 and suggested that emsto can occur only in clusters whose escape velocities are higher than the winds of first - generation stars from which the second generations formed .",
    "intermediate - mass asymptotic - giant - branch stars and massive binaries have wind velocities close to 12 - 15 km s@xmath102 , thus being possible candidates for producing the material from which the second generation formed ( see goudfrooij et al.2014 and correnti et al.2014 for details ) . moreover , goudfrooij , correnti and collaborators have hypothesized the existence of an early - escape - velocity threshold of about 15 km s@xmath102 which differentiate clusters that have experienced a prolonged star - formation from those without emsto .    the evidence of an emsto in ngc1856 , whose velocity escape did not exceed @xmath015 km",
    "s@xmath102 at its formation ( goudfrooij et al.2014 ) , is consistent with this picture . in this context",
    ", it would be interesting to understand why the @xmath0180-myr old lmc cluster ngc1866 , whose velocity escape is only slightly smaller than that of ngc1856 does not show an emsto ( bastian & silva - villa2013 ) .    we have investigated the possibility that the double ms and the emsto have different metallicity and c@xmath16n@xmath16o abundance . in these cases",
    "the blue ms would evolve into the faint msto , while bright - msto stars would be the progeny of the red ms .",
    "however , also in case of iron variation among stars in ngc1856 , we need to assume an age difference of @xmath0150 myr .",
    "if we assume that ngc1856 has constant overall cno content , the blue ms and the faint msto correspond to a @xmath0400myr population with [ fe / h]=@xmath150.6 , while the rms and the bmsto are consistent with a @xmath0150myr - younger stellar population enhanced in [ fe / h ] by @xmath00.4 dex .",
    "observations are also consistent with the younger population having almost the same iron content as the old ones but being enhanced in c@xmath16n@xmath16o by about a factor of two .",
    "interestingly , in paperii we have found that the @xmath0150-old lmc cluster ngc1844 exhibits an intrinsic color spread along the ms .",
    "we have shown that such a feature is well fitted by isochrones with different c@xmath16n@xmath16o , although these models provide a poor fit of the bright ms of ngc1844 . due to the possible similarity between the ms of ngc1844 and ngc1856 it is tempting to speculate that c@xmath16n@xmath16o variations could play a role on the morphology of the ms and msto morphology of young and intermediate - age mc clusters .",
    "unfortunately no abundance measurements are available for ngc1856 to date .",
    "moreover , we are not able to establish whether ngc1856 has homogeneous c , n , o and fe from photometry alone because the connection between the faint and the bright msto with the two mss can not be established unequivocally from our cmds . in this context , it is worth noting the finding by mucciarelli et al.(2014 ) that in the emsto of the lmc cluster ngc1846 there is no evidence for significant variation of [ o / fe ] , [ na / fe ] , [ al / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] , and [ fe / h ] .",
    "this result suggests that intermediate - age clusters in mcs could have homogeneous iron and light - element abundance .",
    "a chemical - abundance study of ngc1856 is needed in order to estimate the iron and c , n , o content of this cluster .    as an alternative interpretation of the emsto phenomenon , bastian & de mink(2009 )",
    "have suggested that rotation in stars mimic an age spread and can be responsible for the emsto of intermediate - age mc clusters .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that the structure of a star is significantly affected by rotation and that its effective temperature depends on the inclination angle relative to the observer .",
    "this interpretation however is in disagreement with the results by girardi et al.(2011 ) , who have calculated isochrones for intermediate - age mc clusters and concluded that a dispersion of radial velocity can not be the only reason for the emsto .",
    "platais et al.(2012 ) have measured projected rotational velocities for upper - ms stars of the @xmath01.3 gyr old galactic open cluster trumpler20 and found very - high rotations up to @xmath103 sin_i_@xmath0180 kms@xmath104 .",
    "these authors have selected two groups of slow- and fast - rotators and found that fast rotators have a marginal bluer colors than slow rotators ( @xmath105(@xmath106)@xmath570.01 mag ) .",
    "they concluded that the msto morphology of trupler20 is marginally affected by rotation .",
    "unfortunately no direct measurements of rotational velocities are available for mc clusters with emsto .    an accurate comparison of our observations with appropriate stellar models is certainly needed to understand the importance of stellar rotation for the explanation of the emsto in ngc 1856 .",
    "nevertheless our findings provide a major challenge to the scenario suggested by bastian & de mink .",
    "indeed , in order to explain the emsto of intermediate - age clusters , these authors have suggested that only stars with masses @xmath107 would be affected by rotation . in the young ngc1856 , stars in this mass interval are located on the ms region , with 20.7@xmath10823.4 , where there is no evidence for a large spread in color , thus suggesting that stellar rotation , if present , would not significantly affect the colors and the magnitudes of these stars . if the emsto of both ngc1856 and intermediate - age clusters is due to stellar rotation it would be challenging to understand why this phenomenon would affect stars with different masses in clusters with different ages . yang et",
    "al.(2011 ) have suggested merged binary systems and interactive binaries with mass transfer can be responsible of both the emsto and dual clumps in intermediate - age mc clusters . despite this",
    "the rest of the ms of these clusters is not significantly spread by binary interaction .",
    "the evidence that ngc1856 exhibits a dual ms seems in disagreement with the scenario suggested by yang and collaborators .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that conclusions from these authors are based on intermediate - age star clusters and that appropriate studies of young clusters are mandatory to establish if interacting binaries are consistent with observations of ngc1856 or not .    in summary",
    "the detection of a double ms and an emsto in the young ngc1856 adds new information to the puzzling emsto - phenomenon of mc star clusters . on the one hand ,",
    "the new findings seem consistent with a prolonged star - formation history thus challenging the interpretation that either stellar rotation or interacting binaries can be responsible of the emsto . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent findings that the sgb morphology of some massive intermediate - age mc cluster with emsto is not consistent with a spread in age ( bastian & niederhofer2015 ; li et al.2014 ) , and the lack of evidence of prolonged star - formation history in extragalactic massive clusters raise doubts on the interpretation of emsto as due to multiple stellar generations with different ages ( or prolonged star formation ) .",
