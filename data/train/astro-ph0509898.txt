    "surveys with bolometer arrays at millimetre ( mm ) and submillimetre ( submm ) wavelengths are potentially sensitive to dusty objects at extreme redshifts , galaxies that drop out of surveys at shorter and longer wavelengths due to obscuration and unfavourable @xmath11 corrections .",
    "the first cosmological surveys using scuba ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) and mambo ( kreysa et al .  1998 ) quickly and radically changed the accepted picture of galaxy formation and evolution , moving away from the optocentric view of the last century .",
    "the discovery of so - called ` scuba galaxies ' ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ) was greeted with surprise due to the remarkable evolution in the dusty , starburst galaxy population implied by such a large source density at the flux levels accessible to the first generation of bolometer arrays ( blain et al .",
    "excitement was replaced by pessimism with the first efforts to study smgs at optical and infrared ( ir ) wavelengths : early reports , backed up with a study in the hubble deep field north by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , suggested that the majority of the submm population had no plausible optical counterparts .",
    "attention was diverted to various redshift engines and broadband photometric techniques ( e.g.townsend et al .",
    "2001 ; aretxaga et al .  2003 ; wiklind 2003 ) . as a result , only a handful of detailed studies were attempted , often for extreme and possibly unrepresentative galaxies ( e.g.  knudsen et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "recent progress has largely been the result of radio imaging of submm survey fields .",
    "early radio follow - up detected roughly half of the submm sources observed ( smail et al .",
    "2000 ; ivison et al .  2002",
    " hereafter i02 ) , with an astrometric precision of @xmath30.3@xmath12 and , combined with the submm flux density , provide a rough estimate of redshift ( carilli & yun 1999 ) .",
    "radio data also enabled some refinement of submm samples ( i02 ) , increasing the detection fraction to two thirds of smgs at 0.85-mm flux density levels in excess of @xmath35mjy . with positions in hand ,",
    "these bright smgs were found to be a diverse population  some quasar - like , with broad lines and x - ray detections ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) , some morphologically complex ( e.g.  ivison et al .  2000",
    "downes & solomon 2003 ; smail , smith & ivison 2005 ) , some extremely red ( e.g.  smail et al.1999 ; gear et al .",
    "2000 ; i02 ; webb et al .  2003b",
    "; dunlop et al.2004 ) , some with the unmistakable signatures of obscured active nuclei and/or superwinds ( e.g.  smail et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts have been difficult to determine . the first survey based on a submm / radio sample",
    "was undertaken by chapman et al.(2003 , 2005  hereafter c03 , c05 ) : the median redshift was found to be @xmath32.2 for @xmath13-mjy galaxies selected using scuba and pinpointed at 1.4ghz .",
    "the accurate redshifts reported by c03 and c05 facilitated the first systematic measurements of molecular gas mass for smgs ( @xmath310@xmath14m@xmath15 ) via observations of co ( neri et al .",
    "2003 ; greve et al .",
    "2005 ) , as well as constraints on gas reservoir size and dynamical mass ( tacconi et al.2005 ) .",
    "the data suggest smgs are massive systems and provide some of the strongest tests of galaxy - formation models to date ( greve et al.2005 ) .    in spite of this progress ,",
    "a detailed understanding of smgs remains a distant goal .",
    "confusion currently limits our investigations to the brightest smgs ( although surveys through lensing clusters have provided a handful of sources more typical of the faint population that dominates the cosmic background  smail et al .",
    "2002 ; kneib et al .",
    "2004 ; borys et al .",
    "we must also recall that selection biases have potentially skewed our understanding : around half of all known smgs remain undetected in the radio ( due simply to the lack of sufficiently deep radio data , which do not benefit from the same @xmath11 correction as submm data ) and the radio - undetected fraction remains largely untargeted by existing spectroscopic campaigns .",
    "these is also only limited coverage of red and ir wavelengths in spectroscopic surveys .    here , we present a robust sample of bright smgs selected using scuba and mambo in one of the ` 8-mjy survey ' regions : the lockman hole ( see scott et al .",
    "2002 ; fox et al .",
    "2002 ; i02 ; greve et al .  2004 ; mortier et al .",
    "our goal is to provide a bright sample which we would expect to detect in well - matched radio imaging ( @xmath16 ) whilst minimising , so far as is practicable , the possibility that sources are spurious or anamalously bright .",
    "we may thus determine the true fraction of radio drop - outs amongst smgs ( potentially lying at very high redshift , @xmath7 ) , as well as practical information such as the intrinsic positional uncertainty for smgs in the absence of radio / ir counterparts .",
    "throughout we adopt a cosmology , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19km@xmath20mpc@xmath5 .",
    "existing surveys have typically employed a snr threshold of 3.03.5 . at these",
    "snrs , false detections are dominated by ` flux boosting ' (  2.2 ) , possibly at the 1040 per cent level ( scott et al .  2002",
    "; laurent et al .  2005 ) .",
    "our goal is to provide a highly reliable submm source catalogue , free from concerns about contamination by spurious or artificially bright sources .",
    "this issue has limited our ability to address the true recovery fraction in the radio , and hence the corrections that must be made to the redshift distributions that are used to determine star - formation histories and galaxy - formation models .    to achieve this",
    "we have combined independent submm and mm maps of the lockman hole , constructing a single , reliable catalogue that is several times larger than would have been realised by simply adopting a high snr threshold in the individual submm and mm maps .",
    "greve et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argued that several maps with low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the same region , with only marginal differences in frequency , produce several visualisations of essentially the same sky , tracing the same population of luminous , dust - enshrouded galaxies and we have adopted the same philosophy in the present work .",
    "our maps came from the survey of greve et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who presented a 1.2-mm map of the lockman hole region ( as well as data on the elais n2 region ) , centred on the coordinates mapped at 0.85 mm by scuba in the ` 8-mjy survey ' ( scott et al .  2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "mortier et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have recently present a refined analysis of scuba data which lies within the lockman hole mambo map ; we began with a 2-@xmath1 mambo catalogue , extracted as described by greve et al .",

    "( 2005 ) sample , applying a correction for separation and checking for a combined significance above our initial threshold , 4.5@xmath1 .",
    "we included sources that exceed 4.5@xmath1 in either dataset , as long as there is a valid reason why the source is not seen in the other image .",

    "7 shows a histogram of @xmath25 magnitudes compared with those from the surveys by smail et al.(2002 ) , i02 , clements et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and pope et al .",
    "the various surveys broadly agree , with median @xmath25-band magnitudes ranging between @xmath2626 and a wide range in magnitude within each sample .",
    "the clements et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample has a bright tail which is less evident in the other surveys .",
    "our sample appears to show the smallest dispersion , although the presence of upper - limits in all five samples make this statement hard to quantify .",
    "nevertheless , from this comparison we can state that the bright , radio - identified smg population , spanning barely a magnitude in submm flux density , covers over 10 orders of magnitude in rest - frame ultraviolet flux .",
    "the optical magnitudes of the radio - identified smgs discussed in this paper span around @xmath2726 , with a faint tail .",
    "the median magnitude is @xmath28 , comparable to the sample analysed by c05 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30.6mag fainter than the spectroscopically - identified sample of c05 .",
    "as expected , a similar bias in the spectroscopically identified subset exists within our own sample , which is @xmath30.9mag brighter than our complete catalogue .",
    "the redshift distribution determined here inevitably suffers from spectroscopic incompleteness , but our sample should be otherwise unbiased . concentrating on cases where our spectroscopy failed to secure a robust redshift",
    "the failures tend to coincide with the faintest optical counterparts , @xmath30 , as one might expect .",
    "looking at the long - wavelength flux ratios ( fig .",
    "5 ) for those targets where we failed to obtain identifications or redshifts , e.g.lh1200.002 or .004 , we see no indication that their ( sub)mm / radio photometric properties differ from those of the sample as a whole . it seems unlikely therefore that they lie at substantially higher redshifts than the subset of smgs for which we have obtained redshifts .",
    "the exceptions are lh1200.022 , and especially lh1200.007 , which have relatively low 0.85-/1.2-mm flux density ratios and fairly high 1.2-mm/1.4-ghz flux density ratios .",
    "this suggests they may lie at high redshift , or be particularly cold .",
    "however , as discussed in  3.2 , these two sources are not particularly secure ( although that may simply reflect their general faintness in all bands due to their high redshifts ) .",
    "reliable identification of these two sources is therefore only achievable through higher resolution ( interferometric ) ( sub)mm observations ( e.g.  lutz et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "for the six smgs where we have a single radio identification ( and hence an unambigious counterpart ) and for which we have measured robust redshifts ( table  3 ) , we determine a median of @xmath31 ( where the scatter is estimated from bootstrap re - sampling ) .",
    "this rises slightly to @xmath10 if we include the four sources with robust redshifts for at least one radio counterpart and the five smgs where we have less secure redshifts .",
    "these figures are slightly lower than , but entirely consistent with , the spectroscopic redshift distribution determined by c05 ( _ z _ = 2.2 ) .",
    "this suggests that the statistical properties of the c05 sample has not been strongly biased by the modest significance @xmath323@xmath1 ) of some of the submm data used in their analysis .",
    "the median redshift we derive is in reasonable agreement with that predicted by the galform semi - analytic model ( baugh et al.2005 ) , which gives a median redshift of @xmath33 at our flux limit , with a quartile range of @xmath340.9 and only 1020 per cent of the population at @xmath35 .",
    "this again suggests that much of the activity in the bright smg population is amenable to study via the precise positions derived from their radio counterparts .",
    "this provides a much - needed route to identify the true far - ir - luminous source within these frequently morphologically complex and crowded fields .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "8 the distribution of 1.2-mm/1.4-ghz and 0.85-/1.2-mm flux ratios for our sample versus our spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the former show a trend to higher flux ratios at higher redshifts , in line with predictions from sed modelling ( e.g.  carilli & yun 1999 ) , although with a large scatter ; the latter flux ratio , however , is essentially a scatter plot .",
    "we conclude that significantly more reliable flux measurements ( in terms of both absolute calibration and overall snr ) will be needed to use the 0.85-/1.2-mm flux ratio for astrophysical analysis .    at face value , both our spectroscopic redshift distribution and that of c05 are inconsistent with the redshift distribution ( _ z _ @xmath32 3 ) claimed by eales et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using the @xmath36 flux density ratio ( fig .",
    "the eales et al.sample contained 23 sources with @xmath37 = 3.16.5mjy ( cf .",
    "19 sources , @xmath37 = 1.65.7mjy here ) , with a radio - detected fraction of 73 per cent ( cf .",
    "79 per cent here ) .",
    "thus , the two samples differ only in that the eales et al .",
    "photometry targets were selected above 4@xmath1 at 1200@xmath38 m rather than above 5@xmath1 at a combination of 850 and 1200@xmath38 m .",
    "we believe the disagreement in the mean redshifts derived by these studies most likely results from the fact that current photometric measurements in the mm and submm wavebands are insufficiently precise for typical smgs to allow them to be used as a reliable redshift indicator , particularly when some data do not comprise fully sampled images .",
    "the disagreement may have been compounded by the lower significance of the eales et al .",
    "targets , and the dual - wavelength extraction performed here could exclude the most distant starbursts ( though we note that the radio - detection of a substantial number of the eales et al.targets is hard to reconcile with the high median redshift claimed for that sample ; indeed , the radio - based estimates given in eales et al . , with _ z _ = 2.35 , are more consistent with the spectroscopic results ) .",
    "we have developed and applied a dual - survey extraction technique to scuba and mambo images of the lockman hole , resulting in a robust sample of 19 smgs .",
    "of these , 15 are detected securely by our deep radio imaging . those undetected at 1.4ghz can be explained by a combination of contamination by spurious sources ( 10 per cent ) and the large observed scatter in radio flux densities , which is probably due to a significant range in dust temperature .",
    "we determine 15 spectroscopic redshifts , of which we consider ten to be secure .",
    "the resulting redshift distribution ( _ z _ = 2.14 for the full spectroscopic sample ) is consistent with that determined for a much larger sample by c05 ( _ z _ = 2.2 ) .",
    "our results thus support the conclusions of c05 , who modelled their incompleteness and estimated only a small shift ( @xmath39 ) in the median redshift as a result .",
    "those galaxies for which our spectroscopy failed to determine redshifts are usually optically faint , @xmath30 , where the sample ranges from @xmath27 to @xmath40 with a median of 25.0 .    from the radio detections , and",
    "the spectroscopy , is seems unlikely that a significant fraction of bright smgs lie at very high redshift ( @xmath41 ) and we conclude that the bright smg population is readily amenable to study via radio - selected samples , down to a 850-@xmath38 m flux density limit of @xmath37mjy .",
    "\" we note , however , that the dual - wavelength extraction performed here could potentially bias our sample against very - high - redshift sources which would only be detected at 1.2 mm .    an analysis of separations between smgs and their radio counterparts has allowed us to re - calibrate the rule - of - thumb relationship between positional accuracy , beam size and significance . the most secure smgs , at @xmath310@xmath1 , representative of those expected in upcoming , confusion - limited , wide - field ( tens of square degrees ) 0.85-mm surveys using scuba-2 ( audley et al .",
    "2004 ) , with lower significance , simultaneous detections at 0.45 mm , will be located with a uncertainty of @xmath42arcsec , at which level the precision of the telescope pointing and scuba-2 flat - field may become important contributors to the positional error budget . assuming these sources of uncertainty can be minimised , the current requirement for deep radio coverage to identify counterparts and enable follow - up spectroscopy may not be as urgent , particularly if 3@xmath433-arcsec deployable integral - field units are employed for spectroscopic follow up ( e.g.  kmos  sharples et al .",
