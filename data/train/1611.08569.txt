    "cosmological relaxation of the higgs mass has been proposed recently as an alternative solution to the weak scale hierarchy problem @xcite . in this scenario , a pseudo nambu - goldston boson @xmath0",
    "is coupled to the standard model higgs doublet @xmath1 , scanning the higgs mass from a large initial value to the small present value .",
    "this scalar field , often referred as relaxion , has a potential including the piece enforcing the relaxion to move to scan the higgs mass , and also a periodic barrier potential to stop the relaxion at the position giving @xmath2 .",
    "more specifically , the relevant scalar potential is given by [ potential ] ( ^2 - ) |h|^2 -c_0 + v_b , where @xmath3 denotes the higgs mass cutoff scale , @xmath4 corresponds to the relaxion excursion required to scan the higgs mass - square from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a positive coefficient of order unity as suggested by the naturalness argument , and the barrier potential @xmath8 generically takes the form : @xmath9 with a higgs - dependent amplitude @xmath10 where @xmath11 is determined by the scale where @xmath8 is generated , as well as by the involved couplings . imposing the stationary condition to the potential ( [ potential ] ) , one finds [ stationary ] ~ , where @xmath12 gev and @xmath13 @xcite for the relaxion vacuum value @xmath14 in the present universe",
    ".    there can be two ways to generate the barrier potential as discussed in the literatures @xcite .",
    "the minimal scenario is to generate @xmath8 through the relaxion coupling to the qcd anomaly , i.e. @xmath15 , which would result in @xmath16 , where @xmath17 mev is the qcd scale and @xmath18 is the up - quark yukawa coupling . in this case , @xmath19 is identified as the qcd vacuum angle @xmath20 and therefore constrained as @xmath21 alternatively , the barrier potential can be generated by a new physics around the weak scale , yielding for instance @xmath22 with @xmath11 around the weak scale .    to implement the relaxation mechanism , the amplitude of the barrier potential is required to be bounded as @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath12 gev is the higgs vacuum value in the present universe .",
    "then the stationary condition ( [ stationary ] ) shows that the relaxion mechanism transmutes the weak scale hierarchy @xmath24 to another hierarchy @xmath25 .",
    "although the latter hierarchy can be technically natural , it may require an explanation for its origin .",
    "this issue has been addressed in @xcite , proposing a scheme to generate an exponential hierarchy @xmath26 based on models with @xmath27 axions @xcite .    a key ingredient of the relaxation scheme is a mechanism to dissipate away the relaxion kinetic energy which is originating from the initial potential energy of @xmath28 .",
    "it is usually assumed that the relaxion loses its kinetic energy by the hubble friction during the inflationary period .",
    "then the scheme requires a rather large number of inflationary e - foldings @xcite , which is estimated as @xcite [ efolding_1 ] n_e ~()^2 for the case that the barrier potential is induced by new physics , and [ efolding_2 ] n_e ~ 10 ^ 24()^4 for the other case that the barrier potential is induced by low energy qcd . the above result and",
    "the relaxion scale hierarchy ( [ stationary ] ) show that the scenario with qcd - induced barrier potential requires a huge e - folding number and also a big hierarchy among the relaxion scales .",
    "as a too large e - folding number might cause a severe fine - tuning problem , in the following we will focus on the scenario that the barrier potential is generated by new physics around the weak scale , yielding [ barrier ] v_b=-_b^4(h)(/f)=-_b^2 |h|^2(/f ) with @xmath29 . by the same reason",
    ", we will be more interested in the case that @xmath11 is somewhat close to the weak scale .    in the relaxation scenario , to avoid a fine - tuning of initial condition",
    ", the relaxion is assumed to be stabilized before the inflation is over . if the temperature during the reheating phase is well below the weak scale which corresponds to the scale where the barrier potential is generated , the relaxion dynamics after the reheating is trivial .",
    "it stays there without changing the higgs mass selected during inflation .",
    "however , if the universe experiences a high temperature @xmath30 after inflation , the electroweak gauge symmetry is restored and the barrier potential disappears . then the relaxion starts to roll again until the temperature cools down to a critical temperature @xmath31 where the barrier potential is developed again , and such subsequent evolution may ruin the successful implementation of the relaxation mechanism . on the other hand , high reheating temperature @xmath32",
    "is often favored for viable cosmology , in particular for baryogenesis .",
    "it is therefore an interesting question if the cosmological relaxation mechanism can be compatible with such high reheating temperature . in this paper , we wish to examine such possibility within the relaxion scenario in which the barrier potential ( [ barrier ] ) is generated by new physics near the weak scale .    to proceed ,",
    "let us first consider the case that there is no additional dissipation of the relaxion energy other than those by the hubble friction . during the period",
    "when @xmath8 is negligible , e.g for radiation - dominated period with @xmath33 , solving the equation of motion determined by ( [ potential ] ) , one finds that the relaxion speed behaves as ( t ) t ( ) ^1/2 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at @xmath36 , and we use the relation ( [ stationary ] ) for the last expression . as the relaxion speed is increasing in time , to stop the relaxion by the barrier potential developed around the time @xmath37",
    ", one needs [ condition_1 ] ( t_c ) _ b^2 .",
    "one can also make sure that if this condition is satisfied , the relaxion is successfully stabilized within a few hubble time from @xmath37 with a total excursion @xmath38 , and therefore the corresponding change of the higgs mass is negligible . on the other hand",
    ", the condition ( [ condition_1 ] ) puts a lower bound on the relaxion decay constant @xmath39 , given by [ bound_f ] ( ) ^1/2 , where we used @xmath31 .",
    "although it is possible that the dynamics to generate @xmath8 involves a small coupling , so @xmath40 , such a small @xmath41 is disfavored as it requires a bigger e - folding number ( [ efolding_1 ] ) for a given value of the higgs mass cutoff @xmath3 . for @xmath42 which is more",
    "favored in view of ( [ efolding_1 ] ) , the bound ( [ bound_f ] ) suggests that @xmath39 should be at least comparable to the planck scale .",
    "the above observation implies that one needs an additional mechanism to dissipate the relaxion energy to make the scheme compatible with @xmath43 for the more interesting parameter range with @xmath42 and @xmath44 .",
    "it is well known that a rolling scalar field @xmath0 can lose its kinetic energy through gauge field production induced by the coupling , x _ ^ , [ anomalous_coupling ] where @xmath45}$ ] is an abelian gauge field strength and @xmath46 is its dual . in the presence of this coupling",
    ", a rolling @xmath0 develops tachyonic instability of @xmath47 , causing an exponential growth of @xmath47 for certain range of wave number .",
    "this provides an effective frictional force to the motion of @xmath0 , which has been applied recently to the relaxion dynamics in the early universe @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of high reheating temperature in the relaxation scenario in which the coupling ( [ anomalous_coupling ] ) is mainly responsible for the relaxion energy dissipation after reheating . as we will see , in case that @xmath47 is identified as the @xmath48 gauge boson of the standard model ( sm ) , due to its large thermal mass , the gauge field production is not efficient enough to slow down the relaxion motion in most of the parameter space allowed by other constraints . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath47 is identified as a dark gauge boson with negligible thermal mass , the gauge field production can efficiently slow down the relaxion motion , allowing the relaxion to be successfully stabilized after the electroweak phase transition for a wide range of model parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : production_gauge_field ] , we review the gauge field production by a rolling scalar field with the coupling ( [ anomalous_coupling ] ) , and apply the results for the relaxion dynamics at @xmath30 .",
    "our primary concern is to identify the parameter region which allows the reheating temperature @xmath43 without modifying the standard cosmology after reheating . for this",
    ", we estimate the relaxion excursion and terminal speed at the time when the relaxion is stopped by a barrier potential developed at @xmath31 .",
    "we provide also numerical results to cross check our analytic estimation . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss additional constraints on the scenario discussed in the previous section , and section [ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion .",
    "in the presence of the coupling ( [ anomalous_coupling ] ) , a background evolution of relaxion develops tachyonic instability of the abelian gauge boson @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "let us begin with the case without any light @xmath49 charged particle , in which the gauge field production turns out most efficient . in this case",
    ", there is no thermal mass of @xmath47 even at high temperature limit , and then the equation of motion for @xmath47 in the expanding universe is given by x_+ ( k^2 a k ) x_= 0 , where @xmath50 denotes the helicity state , @xmath51 is the scale factor of the expanding universe with the metric @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the conformal time @xmath55 and the physical time @xmath56 . assuming @xmath57 , the positive helicity state experiences tachyonic instability for the wave number @xmath58 . using the wkb approximation",
    ", we find that the corresponding gauge field modes grow as x_+(k ) ~ , with the growth rate determined as ^2= ak - k^2 [ tachyon_mass1 ] for @xmath59 . here",
    "the lower bound on @xmath60 is required for the validity of wkb approximation , @xmath61 .",
    "note that the gauge field production is dominated for the modes with @xmath62 .",
    "so a rolling relaxion produces gauge fields with comoving wave number @xmath63 , and those gauge fields will eventually modify the evolution of relaxion . to see the interplay between the gauge field production and the relaxion evolution , we consider the relaxion equation of motion = - 3 h - - x _",
    "^ , [ eom_scalar ] where the ensemble average of gauge fields is given by x _ ^ & = & dk k^3 ( | x_+|^2 - |x_-|^2 ) + & & , [ gauge_friction ] where @xmath64 is the wave length at which the gauge field production is maximized .",
    "the above equation of motion shows that the produced gauge fields provide additional frictional force to the relaxion motion .",
    "then the relaxion speed reaches at its terminal value around the time when the accelerating force @xmath65 in is balanced by the last frictional force term .",
    "we already noticed that the gauge field production is most efficient for @xmath62 .",
    "then , equating with @xmath65 , the relaxion terminal speed is estimated as _ term= h f , [ term_v ] where the dimensionless coefficient @xmath66 mildly depends on various factors such as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and the initial condition for @xmath47 .",
    "we performed a numerical analysis to examine the relaxion evolution for the model parameters in table [ tab : parameter_set_1 ] , and depict the result in figure [ fig : vel_no_plasma ] .",
    "our result shows that the relaxion speed indeed approaches to the form ( [ term_v ] ) with @xmath69 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : terminal_velocity ] .    .sample model parameters for numerical analysis .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure [ fig : param ] , we show the viable parameter region for our scenario in the absence ( left ) and presence ( right ) of dark plasma of the sm singlet but @xmath49-charged particles . for the purpose of illustration",
    ", we adopt the dark sector temperature @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "there are two primary requirements : conditions for successful relaxation , i.e. or discussed in the previous section , and additional constraints for @xmath72 discussed in this section .",
    "other constraints from astrophysics and terrestrial experiments @xcite are overlaid in the same plot .",
    "first of all , in the presence of dark plasma providing a thermal mass @xmath73 , our scenario works only on a very limited region of parameter space as described in figure .",
    "[ fig : param ] .",
    "the viable parameter regions shrink even more if we increase @xmath74 .",
    "this essentially forbids the @xmath49 gauge boson to be identified as the sm @xmath48 gauge boson for the most of parameter space , as stated in the end of previous section . on the other hand",
    ", our mechanism works for a reasonably wide range of parameter space in the absence of dark plasma .",
    "in particular , @xmath41 can be as large as @xmath75 which is preferred in view of the inflationary model building .",
    "such a large @xmath41 is constrained further by the fifth force experiments and stellar evolution in globular clusters .",
    "our scenario may be tested if the sensitivity of these experiments is significantly improved in the future .",
    "we finally comment on the possible perturbations of the relaxion field around homogeneous background . as in the conventional relaxation scenario @xcite",
    ", we assume that the electroweak scale is selected during the long period of inflation .",
    "then the background value of relaxion at the beginning of reheating is highly homogeneous . on the other hand ,",
    "since the production of @xmath49 bosons depends on the gauge field wave number , one may suspect that an inhomogeneity of @xmath0 might be developed consequently .",
    "however , it turns out that due to the negative feedback working between the relaxion speed and the gauge field production , the relaxion excursion in homogenous and isotropic background is stable against perturbations .",
    "eventually the relaxion field enters into the terminal regime , and thereafter the growth of perturbations is by no means possible as @xmath76 and the resulting gauge field production continuously decay . we thus conclude that sizable perturbations in the relaxion and @xmath49 gauge fields can hardly be produced in our scenario .",
    "in this paper , we examined if the cosmological relaxation of the higgs boson mass , which was proposed recently as an alternative solution to the weak scale hierarchy problem , can be compatible with high reheating temperature well above the weak scale .",
    "as the barrier potential disappears at high temperature , the relaxion rolls down further after the reheating , which may ruin the successful selection of the right higgs boson mass .",
    "as it can provide a working scheme over a wide range of model parameters , we focus on the scenario that the relaxion is coupled to a dark @xmath49 gauge boson as @xmath77 . in the presence of this coupling , the background relaxion evolution causes tachyonic instability of the @xmath49 gauge boson , leading to an explosive gauge field production .",
    "then the relaxion is slowed down soon after the gauge field production , and can be re - stabilized by the barrier potential developed at lower temperature around the electroweak scale .    to identify the working parameter region",
    ", we estimate the relaxion excursion after the reheating and impose the condition not to produce too much @xmath49 gauge bosons , as well as other observational constraints on the model parameters .",
    "we have examined this for two different cases .",
    "the first is the case that there is no thermal plasma of @xmath49-charged particles , so no thermal mass of the @xmath49 gauge boson .",
    "the second is the case with dark plasma providing a thermal gauge boson mass @xmath78 . in the first case ,",
    "the gauge field production is most efficient , and therefore a successful re - stabilization of the relaxion can be achieved over a wide range of model parameters , including the one with @xmath79 gev which is favored in view of the required inflationary e - folding number in ( [ efolding_1 ] ) . in the second case ,",
    "the thermal mass @xmath80 suppresses the gauge boson production , and then the relaxion can be successfully re - stabilized only for a limited parameter range with smaller @xmath41 .    through this study",
    ", we have also shown that @xmath49 can hardly be identified as the @xmath48 of the sm under the assumption that the universe has been radiation - dominated until when the relaxion is re - stabilized .",
    "if we adopt the possibility that the universe is dominated by the relaxion energy density over certain period , @xmath49 might be identified as the @xmath48 for a limited range of model parameters .",
    "although an interesting possibility , the analysis for this case is more involved , and we leave it to future work .",
