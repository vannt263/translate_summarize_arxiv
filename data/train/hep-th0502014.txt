    "however , it is known  @xcite that all wigner particle types do allow for localization , in a certain sense , in spacetime regions which extend to infinity in some space  like direction .    in this contribution , we present the construction of free wightman type fields for the massless `` infinite spin '' particles , which are localized in semi  infinite strings extending to space  like infinity . this result solves the old problem  @xcite of reconciling these representations with the principle of causality .",

    "let us make precise what we mean by a string ",
    "localized covariant free quantum field for a given particle type .",
    "the `` _ string _ '' is a ray which extends from a point @xmath0 to infinity in a space  like direction . that is to say ,",

    "namely , consider the single particle vector @xmath23 if a free field @xmath9 as above is given .",
    "it enjoys certain specific properties reflecting the covariance and locality of the field .",
    "the crucial point is that these properties are intrinsic to the representation @xmath7 and can be formulated without reference to the field , using the concept of a modular localization structure  @xcite based on tomita  takesaki modular theory .",
    "we will call a @xmath24-valued distribution satisfying the ensuing properties a _ string  localized covariant wave function _ for @xmath7 , cf .  definition  [ stringlocwfct ] .",
    "our strategy is to reverse the route , namely to construct such a @xmath24-valued distribution @xmath25 for given @xmath7 and then to obtain the field via second quantization .",
    "the idea of the construction of @xmath25 is as follows .",
    "recall that an irreducible representation @xmath7 of the poincar group is induded by a representation @xmath26 of a subgroup @xmath27 of the lorentz group .",
    "if @xmath28 is an extension of @xmath26 to the lorentz group , then @xmath7 is contained in @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the scalar representation .",

    "the @xmath30 part is solved by fourier transformation .",

    "exhibit in  @xcite a suitable representation @xmath28 , for which they ( implicitely ) construct a localized covariant wave function living on @xmath31 .",
    "consider then the tensor product of a wave function localized at @xmath32 for @xmath30 and a wave function localized at @xmath33 for @xmath28 .",
    "our basic result is that the projection onto @xmath7 of this vector turns out to be a vector which is localized for @xmath7 in the string with initial point @xmath34 and direction @xmath2 .",
    "we recall the relevant representations @xmath7 of the poincar group and the concept of a modular localization structure in sections 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "we will concentrate on the bosonic representations with positive mass and for those with zero mass and infinite spin , in dimension @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in section 4",
    "we present the ( definition and ) construction of a string  localized covariant wave function , as sketched above . in section 5",
    "we summarize our results and give a brief outlook .",
    "following wigner  @xcite , the state space of an elementary relativistic particle corresponds to an irreducible ray representation of the poincar group with positive energy .",
    "we recall the relevant representations here for spacetime dimension @xmath35 and @xmath36 , restricting to proper representations since we are at the moment only interested in bosons .",
    "we denote the proper orthochronous poincar and lorentz groups by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . reflecting the semidirect product structure @xmath39 , elements of the poincar group",
    "will be denoted @xmath40 .",
    "an irreducible positive energy representation @xmath7 of @xmath37 is characterized by two data .",
    "the first one is the mass value @xmath41 , determining the energy  momentum spectrum of the corresponding particle as the mass hyperboloid @xmath42 given @xmath43 , one fixes a base point @xmath44 , and considers the stabilizer subgroup , within @xmath38 , of this point .",
    "this so  called `` little group '' will be denoted @xmath45 in the sequel .",
    "then the second characteristicum of @xmath7 is a unitary irreducible representation @xmath46 of @xmath45 , acting in a hilbert space @xmath47 .",
    "the representation @xmath7 fixed by these data is said to be induced from @xmath26 .",
    "it acts on @xmath48 which we identify with @xmath49 , according to @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the so  called wigner rotation , defined by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a section of the bundle @xmath54 , i.e.  @xmath55 maps @xmath56 to @xmath57 .    the little groups @xmath45 can be conveniently determined as follows",
    "let @xmath58 then @xmath45 is precisely the ( unit component of the ) isometry group of @xmath59 .",
    "but @xmath59 , with the induced metric from ambient minkowski space , is isometric to the sphere @xmath60 for @xmath61 , and to @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "( eg .  for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the map @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , defined by @xmath67 can be checked to be an isometric diffeomorphism . )",
    "it follows that the little group @xmath45 is for @xmath61 isomorphic to @xmath68 , and for @xmath63 isomorphic to the euclidean group in @xmath69 dimensions , i.e.  @xmath70 in @xmath64 and @xmath71 in @xmath35 .",
    "now faithful representations of @xmath72 are infinite dimensional . owing to this fact , a representation @xmath7 resulting from @xmath63 and a faithful representation of @xmath45",
    "is called a",
    "_ massless infinite spin representation_. the faithful representations @xmath26 of @xmath72 are labelled by a strictly positive number @xmath73 , and @xmath74 acts on @xmath75 according to @xmath76",
    "as the first step in our construction , the single particle space is endowed with a family of so  called tomita operators , labelled by a specific class of spacetime regions . this family will be called a modular localization structure for the single particle space .",
    "the basic geometrical ingredient is the family of wedge regions .",

    "more precisely , for the standard wedge @xmath82 the boosts @xmath83 act on the coordinates @xmath84 as @xmath85 and the reflection @xmath86 inverts the sign of the coordinates @xmath84 and leaves the other coordinate(s ) invariant . for a general wedge @xmath87 , @xmath88 , the boosts and reflection",

    "then we define an anti  linear operator associated with @xmath79 by @xmath94 owing to the group relations , it is an antilinear involution , @xmath95 , i.e.  a so  called tomita operator .",

    "it is known  @xcite that each @xmath97 coincides with the intersection of all wedges which contain @xmath98 .",
    "typical regions belonging to this class are double cones , space  like cones , and wedges . for each @xmath97",

    "@xmath102 the family of these anti  linear involutions satisfies isotony  @xcite , @xmath103 for @xmath104 , and covariance , @xmath105 .",
    "it has further a property  @xcite which will soon turn out to correspond to locality :    [ tomop ] if @xmath106 and @xmath107 are causally disjoint , then @xmath108    choose a wedge @xmath79 which contains @xmath106 and whose causal complement @xmath109 contains @xmath107 .",

    "all these properties motivate us to call the family @xmath101 , @xmath97 , a _ modular localization structure _ the real subspace @xmath119 these are precisely the @xmath120 eigenspaces of our tomita operators  , . but",

    "thus , the property of our modular localization structure implies the locality property of the second quantization .",
    "the motivation to construct the modular localization structure from the representation @xmath4 is the bisognano - wichmann theorem  @xcite .",

    "thus , given a local quantum field @xmath133 , the vectors @xmath136 , @xmath137 , are the prototypes for elements of the subspace @xmath100 .",
