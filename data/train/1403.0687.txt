    "perturbation series for helmholtz free energy of a fluid at a given temperature and density was first written down by zwanzig@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to split the total potential energy(@xmath0 ) of the fluid containing n - particles into a reference part(@xmath1 ) and a perturbation part ( @xmath2 ) . assuming that @xmath2 is small",
    ", the term @xmath3 in the canonical partition function of the fluid is expanded in a series of @xmath4 . where @xmath5 ; @xmath6 being boltzmann constant and t being temperature .",
    "this results in a cumulant expansion for helmholtz free energy .",
    "the series is also known as high temperature series expansion(htse ) .",
    "the perturbation series of zwanzig is general in the sense that it does nt restrict to pairwise additive interactions between the fluid particles .",
    "however , if the interactions are pairwise additive , zwanzig showed that the first order term in the series depends on radial distribution function(rdf ) of the reference system and the second order term depends on correlation functions up to fourth order .",
    "an approximation to the second order term was obtained by barker and henderson@xcite .",
    "it was not possible to calculate beyond second order as the higher order correlation functions are unknown .",
    "the perturbation series for the helmholtz free energy can be derived in alternative ways@xcite using coupling parameter or strength parameter ( @xmath7 ) which defines the strength of perturbation .",
    "the total potential energy of an imaginary fluid is written as , @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 gives the reference fluid potential energy and @xmath10 gives potential energy of the fluid under consideration .",
    "one way of arriving at the perturbation series is to differentiate the helmholtz free energy of the imaginary system w.r.t .",
    "@xmath7 . the derivative depends on ensemble average of @xmath2 w.r.t .",
    "the imaginary fluid i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath11 is expanded as a taylor series around @xmath12 and then the equation is integrated within the limits @xmath12 and @xmath10 .",
    "this is called as @xmath7-expansion and the terms are exactly the same as the htse .",
    "another way of obtaining the series , which works only in the case of a pairwise additive potential between the particles , is as follows : the helmholtz free energy of the system is expanded as a taylor series in @xmath7 around @xmath9 . in the case of a pairwise additive potential ,",
    "it turns out that the taylor series of helmholtz free energy depends on the taylor series of the pair correlation function with respect to @xmath7 at @xmath9 .",
    "this expansion of helmholtz free energy is referred as coupling parameter series expansion(cpse ) . in order to calculate @xmath13 order term in this expansion , @xmath14 derivative of pair correlation function",
    "is supposed to be known .",
    "the first order term in the cpse can be directly seen to be equal to first order perturbation term in htse .",
    "the method to calculate higher order terms ( including the second order term in an accurate way ) was not known for a long time . in 2006",
    ", zhou@xcite developed a numerical method to calculate the higher order derivatives of rdf using the integral equation theory ( iet ) .",
    "zhous method was , however , computationally intensive and the calculated derivatives have numerical fluctuations and require further smoothing procedures .",
    "recently , we developed a much simpler method which does nt have those problems@xcite .",
    "the ability to calculate higher order terms , which was not possible with the earlier htse enormously improved the accuracy of predictions of the theory .    in a few recent papers@xcite",
    ", it has been argued that the htse and cpse are actually different beyond the first order term .",
    "it also has been stated that , only in the special case of hard sphere reference system and only for reduced temperature equal to 1 , the two series are equal .",
    "however , the conclusions were not based on any rigorous results and the arguments were heuristic .",
    "apart from this , a function having two different series expansions contradicts the uniqueness of power series expansion .",
    "this raises questions about the validity of the conclusions made in the papers@xcite .",
    "in view of this , we re - examine the equivalence of cpse and htse and prove rigorously that both the expansions are equivalent . even though this result is not very surprising , the equivalence of cpse and htse leads to interesting scaling relations in the case of fluids with interaction potential having a hardcore repulsion(for example , the square well ( sw ) fluid ) if the hardcore repulsive part is taken as reference .",
    "for such fluids , the htse becomes a power series in @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the terms of cpse also scale with powers of @xmath16 . as a consequence ,",
    "once the terms of cpse are calculated along a particular isotherm for such fluids , the structure and thermodynamic properties of those fluids at other temperatures can be obtained using the scaling relations .    in section",
    "ii , we prove the equivalence of cpse and htse and in section iii we describe the consequences of the equivalence of htse and cpse .",
    "the paper is concluded in section iv .",
    "consider a fluid of n interacting particles in a volume @xmath17 at reduced temperature t. reduced units ( @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the well depth and @xmath20 is hard sphere diameter ) are used throughout the paper .",
    "the zwanzigs expansion or htse for helmholtz free energy @xmath21 of the system is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 the subscript @xmath24 implies that the averages are with respect to the reference system ensemble .",
    "in the eq.([z5 ] ) , the @xmath25 implies that the summation is a multiple sum over all possible @xmath26s such that the constraint @xmath27 is satisfied . here",
    "@xmath26s are positive integers .",
    "it can be seen that for all @xmath28 , @xmath26 s are zero . above series for",
    "@xmath21 does nt require a pairwise additive interaction potential .",
    "however , in the case of a spherically symmetric pairwise additive potential @xmath29 , the @xmath30 simplifies to    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the perturbation part of @xmath29 when separated as @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the radial distribution function of the reference system .",
    "@xmath35 is the radial distance from the origin .",
    "@xmath36 has been shown to depend on correlation functions up to fourth order .",
    "an approximation to @xmath36 has been derived by barker and hendersen@xcite .    in the @xmath7-expansion@xcite and the cpse ,",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , an imaginary fluid is considered with total potential energy given by @xmath8 .",
    "differentiating @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 and integrating between limits @xmath40 to @xmath10 gives    @xmath41    the subscript @xmath7 in the above equation implies that the average is @xmath38 the ensemble with potential energy @xmath42 .",
    "expanding @xmath43 around @xmath9 in a taylor series and substituting @xmath44 , we get the htse . in the case of pairwise additive potentials , above eq.([c1 ] ) can be re - written in terms of pair correlation function ( @xmath45 ) of the imaginary system i.e. , @xmath46 following hansen@xcite , we denote the position vector @xmath47 of @xmath48 particle by @xmath49 to simplify notation . @xmath50",
    "denotes the volume element @xmath51 around @xmath52 .",
    "expanding @xmath45 in a taylor series around @xmath9 and substituting in above eq.([c2 ] ) , we get the cpse for @xmath21 given by    @xmath53    if the system is homogeneous and isotropic , @xmath45 becomes equal to @xmath54 and the integral in eq.([c3 ] ) simplifies . here",
    "@xmath55 is the density of the system and @xmath56 is the rdf of the imaginary system .",
    "it can be easily seen that first order terms in both the series are same ; as mentioned above , in a homogeneous system , @xmath45 becomes equal to @xmath54 and @xmath57    in order to see the equivalence of second term of cpse with that of htse , consider the definition of @xmath45 i.e. ,    @xmath58    where @xmath59    here @xmath60 implies @xmath61    now , @xmath62    substituting the above equation in second order term of cpse we get , @xmath63 consider the first term in the rhs of the above equation .",
    "it can be seen that the integral remains invariant if @xmath64 is replaced by any other possible pair and there are exactly @xmath65 possible pairs .",
    "the same argument holds for the second term on the rhs of above eg.([e4 ] ) .",
    "thus the above equation becomes ,    @xmath66    now to prove the equivalence of a general term of cpse to that of htse , we first define the following : @xmath67 and @xmath68 here @xmath50 implies @xmath69 and so on . it can be easily seen that    @xmath70    to get the @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) derivative of @xmath73 , the @xmath71 derivative of @xmath74 is required which in turn requires the the @xmath71 derivative of @xmath75 . since @xmath76 is a well behaved function ,",
    "it can be expected that @xmath71 derivative of @xmath75 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath7 exits .",
    "the @xmath71 derivative of @xmath75 is @xcite    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is again a multiple sum over @xmath26s such that the constraint @xmath79 is satisfied .",
    "using leibnitz formula for calculating the @xmath71 derivative of a product of two functions we get @xmath80 the @xmath81 term in cpse(eq.([c3 ] ) ) is , @xmath82 substituting eq.([e10 ] ) in eq.([e11 ] ) and after some algebra , the @xmath81 term in cpse becomes @xmath83^{n_j } \\\\",

    "it can be seen easily that @xmath93 , as all @xmath26s for @xmath94 must be zero for the constraint of eq.([e14 ] ) to be satisfied .",

    "consider a homogeneous fluid with particles interacting via a pairwise additive spherically symmetric potential .",
    "let the potential @xmath29 have a hardcore repulsion(@xmath96 ) and a slowly varying attractive part(@xmath32 ) whose value is small compared to @xmath97 so that it can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "i.e. , @xmath98 if the hardcore part is taken as the potential of the reference system , the ensemble averages @xmath38 the hard - sphere reference system become independent of temperature . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath99s in equations([z2]- [ z5 ] ) become independent of temperature .",
    "hence the htse becomes a power series in @xmath100 .",
    "this result is well known@xcite . since it has now been shown that the terms of cpse are equivalent to those of htse , the terms of cpse also scale with powers of @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath71 term of the series is proportional to @xmath101 as can be seen from eq.([e17 ] ) .",
    "it can also be seen that the derivatives of rdf and the direct correlation function(dcf ) also scale with powers of @xmath15 .",
    "consider @xmath71 derivative of @xmath102 .",
    "it can be seen from eq.([e10 ] ) that each term in the summation in the r.h.s .",
    "depends upon the following term : @xmath103 which can be re - written as follows @xmath104^{n_j } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{p_{s - r}}{z_0 } \\beta^r(\\langle(-v_{per } ) \\rangle_0^{n_1 } \\langle ( -v_{per})^2 \\rangle_0^{n_2}\\langle(-v_{per})^3 \\rangle_0^{n_3 } ...... ) \\label{f1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when evaluated at @xmath9 with @xmath96 as that of hard - sphere , it can be seen from the eq.([e6 ] ) that @xmath105 depends on @xmath106 . since the averages in above eq.([f1 ] )",
    "become independent of temperature , the total dependence on @xmath15 of each term in the r.h.s . of eq.([e10",
    "] ) would be @xmath107 .",
    "thus , @xmath108 also , since @xmath109 , its fourier transfrom also would be proportional to @xmath110 i.e. ,    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the total correlation function and @xmath113 is its fourier transform .",
    "the ornstein - zernike equation for the imaginary fluid in fourier space is given by@xcite ,    @xmath114    using similar arguments given in the case of @xmath115 , it can be seen that @xmath116    thus from the above discussion , it can be seen that , for the class of fluids with hardcore repulsion , apart from the helmholtz free energy series , the taylor series for @xmath117 and @xmath118 obtained by expanding around @xmath9 also becomes power series in @xmath15 . as a result ,",
    "if the coefficients of the series are obtained along one isotherm , then the whole phase diagram can be obtained provided the series converges . to obtain the coefficients of the series which are related to the derivatives of @xmath56 and @xmath119 at @xmath9 , few recently developed methods are available as discussed in the introduction@xcite .    to test the scaling relations derived above , we applied the method discussed in ref.@xcite to square well(sw ) fluids .",
    "the calculation method used is exactly the same as in ref.@xcite and hence is not repeated here .",
    "we obtained the derivatives of @xmath118 of sw fluid of width @xmath120 at various reduced temperatures(t ) and plotted @xmath121 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 in fig.([1 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig.([1 ] ) that the curves corresponding to each derivative at different temperatures are coinciding after scaling .",
    "also we obtained the first three coefficients of the htse for sw fluids of width @xmath124 and @xmath125 using the same method of ref.@xcite . in the case of sw fluid of width @xmath124 ,",
    "the coefficients of htse are obtained by calculating the terms of cpse at @xmath126 and scaling with temperature according to @xmath127 where @xmath128 is @xmath13 order term in the cpse for helmholtz free energy per particle . in the same way ,",
    "the coefficitents of htse for sw fluid of width @xmath125 are obtained by calculating the terms of cpse at @xmath129 followed by scaling .",
    "the results are compared with simualtion data@xcite in fig([2 ] ) and fig([3 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that there is an excellent match between simulation data and present calculations which confirms the scaling relations .",
    "we have shown rigorously that the cpse and htse are equivalent when the interaction potential is pairwise additive . as a result",
    ", we have shown that for fluids with interaction potential having a hardcore repulsion , if the hard - sphere fluid is taken as the reference system , the terms of cpse and the derivatives of rdf and dcf w.r.t .",
    "the coupling parameter follow a scaling relation with temperature .",
    "we also have confirmed the scaling relations through applications to square well fluids .",
    "thus , for such fluids , if the derivatives of rdf are known along an isotherm , the structural and thermodynamic properties can be obtained at any other temperature provided the series is convergent at that temperature .",
