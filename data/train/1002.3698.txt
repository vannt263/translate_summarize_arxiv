    "the growth over the last decade in the number of experiments designed to create ground state molecules at cold ( @xmath4  k ) and ultracold ( @xmath4  mk ) temperatures is a direct result of the wide - ranging impact expected from the field . it is anticipated that ensembles of ultracold polar molecules will find many applications due to the possibility that their long - range dipolar interactions can be controlled .",
    "such applications include tests of fundamental physical laws , quantum information processing , quantum simulators and controlled molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "the long interrogation times , quantum state selectivity and rich internal structure afforded by trapped ultracold molecules offer inherent advantages for measurements that require ultra - high precision .",
    "for example , the determination of the dipole moment of the electron would test for time - reversal symmetry violation @xcite and the determination of a time variation of fundamental constants would test for the equivalence principle of general relativity @xcite .",
    "ultracold polar molecules that have been trapped in optical lattices could be made to form an adjustable network of variably - interacting quantum bits ( qubits ) where it would be possible to engineer fast logic gates for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a network could be adjusted to act as a quantum simulator for any fully quantum many - body system for solving problems in condensed matter physics that are intractable using traditional computational methods and hardware @xcite .",
    "molecular collisions and chemical reactions depend sensitively on the mutual interactions between the molecules . at cold and ultracold temperatures ,",
    "the collision energy is similar to the stark and zeeman shifts experienced by the molecules in external fields .",
    "therefore , by applying a tailored external electrical or magnetic field , molecular interactions can be controlled to enhance or suppress specific outcomes of a chemical reaction via the fine - tuning of scattering resonances @xcite .    to date",
    ", the only polar molecules that have been produced in their rovibronic ground states at ultracold temperatures are krb @xcite , rbcs @xcite and lics @xcite , which were formed by associating ultracold atoms .",
    "the technique is thus far limited to alkali - alkali molecules , which do not possess a magnetic moment , a desirable property for many applications . in a promising development",
    ", it was shown that it may be possible to laser cool srf directly to ultracold temperatures due to its unique energy level structure @xcite . however , for applications , a variety of species at ultracold temperatures and high densities is required .",
    "the most versatile approach is to sympathetically cool trapped _",
    "cold _ polar molecules into the ultracold regime using ultracold atoms as a refrigerant @xcite .",
    "therefore , the initial production of high densities of a variety of cold molecular species remains a major challenge in the field .",
    "a variety of techniques have been developed for the production of cold ground state molecules @xcite with buffer gas cooling and stark deceleration the established leaders in the field @xcite .",
    "each technique has well documented limitations , not least in terms of expense and difficulty of execution .",
    "therefore , it is very important to continue developing new economical techniques that have the potential to expand the list of cold species .",
    "in this paper , we present direct measurements of molecules produced with zero mean velocity in the laboratory frame , using a novel , accessible and economical technique , dubbed photostop .",
    "the method is based on the controlled breaking of one chemical bond , via photodissociation , in a precursor molecule initially cooled in a supersonic molecular beam .",
    "the result is an atomic or molecular fragment that recoils with a velocity that cancels out the initial velocity of the precursor molecule in the beam , @xmath5 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) schematic outline of the photostop technique .",
    "the recoil velocity of no fragments , @xmath6 , from the photodissociation of no@xmath0 molecules cancels the velocity of the molecular beam , @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , no molecules are produced with zero velocity in the laboratory frame while the oxygen co - fragments are accelerated .",
    "( b ) schematic diagram of the no@xmath0 potential energy surfaces .",
    "ground state no@xmath0 molecules are photo excited into the @xmath8 state which predissociates onto the ground state surface to form no(@xmath9 ) molecules and o(@xmath10 ) atoms . by tuning the photon energy , @xmath11 , the total kinetic energy , @xmath12 , released by the photodissociation process can be adjusted for given total internal energy , @xmath13 , of both photofragments . , width=325 ]    in this experiment the precursor molecule of choice is no@xmath0 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , photon energies , @xmath11 , exceeding the dissociation energy , @xmath14 , of the no  o bond cause the no@xmath0 molecule to fragment into an no molecule and an oxygen atom .",
    "the excess energy , @xmath15 , is partitioned between the kinetic and internal energies of the fragments in varying proportions determined by the complex predissociation dynamics  @xcite . for fragments formed in a given state , the total internal energy , @xmath13 ,",
    "is fixed and the total kinetic energy , @xmath12 , released is therefore governed only by the photon energy @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the kinetic energies of the no and o fragments , respectively . by conservation of momentum ,",
    "the velocities of the fragments ( in the center - of - mass frame of the photodissociation process ) are given by    [ eqn : ufrag ] @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the respective masses .",
    "no molecules are stopped in the laboratory frame if @xmath22 and , from equations  [ eqn : tker ] and  [ eqn : ufrag ] , the wavelength of the photons required is given by @xmath23^{-1 } \\label{eqn : lambda}\\ ] ] exchanging the indices of no and o in eq .",
    "[ eqn : lambda ] yields the corresponding wavelength to stop the o fragment .",
    "a schematic diagram of the experiment is shown in fig .  [ fig2](a ) .",
    "the molecular beam is formed from a skimmed pulsed ( 10  hz repetition rate ) supersonic expansion of 15% no@xmath0 in 4   bar of xe , the direction of which defines the @xmath24-axis of the experiment .",
    "the molecular beam is intersected at right angles by two laser beams counter - propagating along the @xmath25-axis .",
    "the first beam is used to photodissociate the no@xmath0 molecules and is generated by a pulsed dye laser tunable in the range of 380400  nm .",
    "the second beam , generated by another pulsed dye laser tunable around 226  nm , is used to ionize no(@xmath26 ) molecules in a specific rovibrational quantum state using ( 1  +  1 ) resonance - enhanced multiphoton ionization ( rempi ) via the @xmath27 state . the molecular beam and",
    "the laser beams intersect at the center of an ion lens system oriented along the @xmath28-axis .",
    "the resulting no@xmath29 ions are accelerated by the electrostatic field towards a position sensitive imaging detector consisting of a pair of micro - channel plates , a phosphorescent screen and a ccd camera .",
    "the ion lens system is designed and operated such that the velocity of the original no molecule is mapped onto a unique position on the detector , a technique known as velocity mapped ion imaging ( vmi ) @xcite .",
    "the detected ion image corresponds to the 2-dimensional projection of the original 3-dimensional velocity distribution of the no molecules onto the @xmath30 plane .",
    "such a set - up allows the direct measurement of the absolute velocity of both the molecular beam and of the no fragment molecules , which is vital in maximizing the efficiency of the technique .        in order to measure the velocity of the no molecules in the laboratory frame , the velocity origin , _ i.e. _  the position on the detector that corresponds to @xmath31 ,",
    "was determined from the center of an ion image of thermal no bled into the vacuum chamber .",
    "the velocity of the molecular beam was determined from an ion image of the small fraction of `` native '' no present in the beam due to the thermal decomposition of the no@xmath0 sample at room temperature .",
    "the velocity of the molecular beam was measured to be @xmath32 with a full - width at half maximum of 80  m  s@xmath33 , which corresponds to a translational temperature of the no@xmath0 molecules of 6  k.    there are three sources of no molecules that can contribute towards signal in the ion   spin - orbit excited to @xmath34 ground state no molecules present in the beam was measured to be less than 1  :  40 , therefore spin - orbit excited no originates almost exclusively from the no@xmath0 dissociation .",
    "thus , by aiming to photostop spin - orbit excited no , interference from native no present in the molecular beam is minimized .",
    "all ion images were recorded with an automatic shot - by - shot background subtraction by electronically blocking every second shot from the photodissociation laser .",
    "therefore , any remaining signal from no present in the background gas in the vacuum chamber is minimized .",
    "[ fig2](b ) shows an ion image representing the velocity distribution of no molecules in the @xmath35 state .",
    "the center of the distribution is offset by the velocity of the molecular beam from the laboratory frame velocity origin , the position of which is illustrated by the cross - hairs . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , the recoil velocity of the no fragments , @xmath6 , can lie on any point on the newton sphere .",
    "however , the photodissociation of no@xmath0 is strongly anisotropic with the no fragments preferentially recoiling in either direction along the polarization direction of dissociation light , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "the outer ring in the image corresponds to the recoiling no fragments , where the polarization direction has been aligned along the molecular beam ( @xmath24 ) axis .",
    "with the dissociation laser wavelength tuned to 386.4  nm , the peak of the no density was optimally overlapped with the velocity origin . those no molecules coinciding with the velocity origin",
    "are thus photo - stopped and those that appear on the exact opposite side of the ion image are accelerated to twice the molecular beam speed . according to eq .  3 , with @xmath36  cm@xmath33 @xcite",
    ", 386.4  nm corresponds to a no fragment speed of 418.5  m s@xmath33 , which equals the molecular beam speed of 415  m s@xmath33 to within the nearest pixel on the camera .",
    "to demonstrate that no fragments are indeed stopped in the laboratory frame , we have recorded a series of ion images , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , as a function of the time delay between the 5  ns long pulses of the photodissociation and probe lasers .",
    "it is clear that molecules remain in the probe laser volume even after 10  @xmath38s .",
    "the panels below each of the ion images show the projection of that ion image onto the @xmath39 axis .",
    "after 1  @xmath38s delay , it can be seen that those no fragments that recoil in the same direction as the molecular beam ( positive @xmath39 ) have duely left the probe laser volume .",
    "the probe volume is much larger along the @xmath25 axis than in the other dimensions , therefore , only no molecules with small @xmath40 and @xmath39 components are discriminated by the probe laser . on the contrary , molecules with larger @xmath41 components are detected .",
    "the grey shaded areas in fig .  2c and fig .",
    "3a represent the velocity acceptance of the probe volume after 1  @xmath38s delay .",
    "all recoiling no molecules with velocities that lie within this velocity acceptance appear as a crescent shape in the 1  @xmath38s ion image .",
    "the asymmetry on the positive side of the corresponding @xmath39 profile is simply due to the projection of the crescent onto the @xmath39 axis . after a delay of 4  @xmath38s , and subsequently 10  @xmath38s ,",
    "the ion images appear straighter because the velocity acceptance narrows in both @xmath40 and @xmath39 but not in @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding projections are almost symmetrical , thus , a temperature of @xmath42  k and @xmath43  k can be assigned to the no molecules that remain at 4 and 10  @xmath38s , respectively , by fitting the profiles with a one - dimensional maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the form @xmath44        fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) shows the decay of the normalized integrated no signal in each recorded ion image as a function of delay time .",
    "the signal decays rapidly in the first microsecond due to no molecules that recoil in the direction of the molecular beam leaving the probe volume .",
    "this is followed by a slow decay that represents the remaining slow molecules leaving the probe volume .",
    "after 10  @xmath38s , @xmath45% of no(@xmath35 ) fragments present at zero delay remain .    clearly , a large proportion of the no fragments produced are not photo - stopped .",
    "the velocities of most no fragments do not lie within the velocity acceptance of the probe volume and are therefore lost at later delays .",
    "this is a direct result of the angular distribution of the photodissociation process , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "the velocity spread of the molecular beam reduces further the proportion of no fragments that can be photo - stopped . at a delay of 10  @xmath38s , the @xmath39 velocity spread of the detected no fragments is @xmath46  m  s@xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) compared to the @xmath47  m  s@xmath33 velocity spread of the molecular beam . however , the reduction of signal by a factor of approx .  250 after this time",
    "is mainly accounted for by the unfavorable angular distribution .    in these experiments , only no fragments in the @xmath35 state were detected . however , the photon energy used is 751  cm@xmath33 above the dissociation threshold , thus , higher no rotational levels up to @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the @xmath34 and @xmath50 spin - orbit states , respectively , are observed to be populated by the photodissociation process .",
    "although energetically allowed , no evidence of spin - orbit excited o(@xmath51 ) co - fragments was found . in order to determine which proportion of no fragments is produced in the @xmath35 state by the photodissociation process , the state distribution needs to be known .",
    "unfortunately , the state distribution is as yet unknown at the photodissociation energy of interest and can not be determined with confidence in our experiments due to the non - linear rempi detection scheme employed . however , assuming a statistical state distribution we estimate the proportion to be on the order of 1% . assuming a no@xmath0 density in the probe volume of @xmath52  @xmath3 , and taking into account the losses due to the state distribution and the velocity acceptance of the probe volume , we estimate the density of photo - stopped no molecules that are probed at 10  @xmath38s delay to be @xmath2  @xmath3 .",
    "the distance between the nozzle and the laser beams is large at 150  mm , which is due to the fact that the experimental set - up is not specifically designed for photostop . in a custom designed machine",
    "this distance can feasibly be reduced to 50  mm , thus increasing the no@xmath0 density by an order of magnitude , and therefore increasing the density of photo - stopped no molecules to @xmath53  @xmath3 .    the detected no molecules are not the only no fragments that are photo - stopped . from a combination of the velocity spread of the molecular beam and the velocity acceptance of the probe volume we estimate that no molecules in the quantum states @xmath54 and @xmath55 are present in the probe volume after 10  @xmath38s in varying proportions . the density of _ all _ photo - stopped molecules ( ca .",
    "10% of the state distribution ) in a custom designed machine is therefore estimated to be on the order of @xmath56  @xmath3 .    during the course of this work",
    ", we became aware that zhao _",
    "_  were independently utilizing the same idea , _ i.e. _  to slow molecular fragments via the recoil from a photodissociation .",
    "they recently reported that they had slowed no(@xmath57 ) molecules to speeds centered around 130  m  s@xmath33 along the molecular beam axis following the 355  nm dissociation of no@xmath0 @xcite . assuming a strictly monoenergetic molecular beam",
    ", they estimated that 34% of all probed no fragments were in the slowest velocity interval of their distribution between 35 and 45  m  s@xmath33 .",
    "crucially , their experimental set - up did not allow them to measure the velocity component along the molecular beam axis directly , but instead they relied on numerical simulations to infer the velocities they quote .",
    "however , they did measure that no molecules of indeterminate velocity were probed at times up to 300  ns after dissociation .",
    "the implementation of the photostop technique is relatively simple as it is based on well established knowledge and technology .",
    "the technique is economical in its requirements : a molecular beam source ; a tunable photodissociation laser ; and a suitable laser spectroscopic detection method , _",
    "e.g. _  laser induced fluorescence . the velocity map ion imaging detection technique is a very effective analytical tool for the success of these experiments because it allows the direct measurement of the molecular beam and photofragment velocities .",
    "we are currently implementing a magnetostatic trap constructed from permanent magnets that will confine photo - stopped no(@xmath1 ) molecules in the low field seeking @xmath58 state at a temperature on the order of 1  k. the velocity acceptance of such a trap will be comparable to that of the probe volume at 10  @xmath38s delay ( see fig .",
    "in contrast to other techniques that have been used to trap molecules @xcite , a major advantage of the photostop technique is that any trap employed does not have to be opened to allow molecules to enter as the trappable molecules would be produced _ in situ_. multiple pulses of stopped molecules could therefore be accumulated to increase density in the trap although trap losses due to collisions with the `` unused '' parts of subsequent gas pulses will need to be minimized , for example , by using beam chopping techniques .    out of the several groups that have proposed schemes for accumulating molecules in a trap , so far",
    ", only two have demonstrated this experimentally .",
    "_  have used buffer gas cooling within a superconducting magnetostatic trap to accumulate ground state nh molecules , although the trap lifetime is limited by the continued presence of the buffer gas @xcite and heiner _ et al .",
    "_  have loaded two pulses into a molecular synchrotron @xcite .",
    "meijer and co - workers are attempting to accumulate ground state nh molecules in a magnetostatic trap using a novel laser excitation scheme @xcite .",
    "_  have proposed that similar laser excitation schemes could be employed together with a buffer gas molecular beam technique to accumulate molecules in a microwave trap @xcite .",
    "all of these techniques are technically demanding in comparison to the economy of the photostop technique .",
    "a suitable precursor for the photostop technique is a molecule that absorbs at wavelengths that satisfy eq .",
    "[ eqn : lambda ] for typical molecular beam speeds .",
    "while no@xmath0 clearly satisfies this criterion , the bent nature of its @xmath59 ground and @xmath8 excited states favors rotational excitation of the no fragment .",
    "this leads to a broad state distribution that dilutes the number of photo - stopped molecules and reduces the state selectivity of the technique . as mentioned earlier , oxygen atoms",
    "can also be stopped by the photodissociation of no@xmath0 . however , by the same argument , no@xmath0 is not the most effective precursor .",
    "polyatomic precursor molecules that are close to linear in both the ground and excited states are more favorable due to the small likelihood that the excess energy in the dissociation will be partitioned into rotational excitation of the molecular fragments .",
    "they are even more effective if they can be dissociated below the thresholds for vibrational excitation of the fragments .",
    "effective precursors for producing photo - stopped atoms are likely to be diatomic molecules as the number of available electronic states is small given typical excess energies required for photostop .",
    "we have demonstrated a novel technique for stopping molecules . in these experiments",
    "we have shown , via the photodissociation of no@xmath0 moving in a molecular beam , that no fragments can be brought to a standstill in the laboratory frame and observed up to 10  @xmath38s at a density of _ ca . _  @xmath2  @xmath3 . with the right choice of precursor molecule , we believe that the photostop technique complements existing techniques for slowing molecules and atoms and can add to the growing list of species that can be studied .",
    "the technique is particularly suited towards trapping of molecules or atoms and offers the opportunity to accumulate them in a trap .",
    "the experimental equipment and techniques employed are economical and well enough studied to make them accessible to many laboratories around the world that wish to perform experiments using slow molecules .",
