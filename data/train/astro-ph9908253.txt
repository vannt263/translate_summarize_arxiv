    "one of the major open problems with ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirg ) is whether they host active nuclei at their centers . in at least a fraction of objects",
    ", there is circumstantial evidence that this is the case .",
    "one of the best examples in this respect is ngc  6240 is the limiting criterion for ulirg , strictly speaking ngc  6240 belongs to this class only if @xmath565 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ; genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . ] , a well known source in which the presence of two nuclei ( fried & schulz 1983 ) suggests an ongoing galaxy merger .",
    "indications of the presence of an agn come mainly from x  rays : the flat 210 kev x  ray spectrum and the prominent iron line complex observed by asca ( iwasawa & comastri 1998 ) are very similar to those of ngc  1068 ( iwasawa , fabian & matt 1997 ; matt et al . 1997 and references therein ) and suggest reflection from cold and warm matter of an otherwise invisible nuclear component . on the other hand , in the optical spectrum all the diagnostic line ratios point towards a classification as a liner ( e.g. veilleux et al . 1995 ) , and the iso sws diagnostic diagram places ngc 6240 in the region of star formation dominance ( genzel et al . 1998 ) . in soft x ",
    "rays the spectrum is fairly complex , and best modeled by multi - temperature plasma emission , very likely associated , at least partly , with the powerful starburst and related wind present in this galaxy , a hypothesis strengthened by the rosat hri discovery of rather luminous ( @xmath610@xmath7 erg @xmath1 s@xmath3 ) emission extended over tens of kpc ( komossa , schulz & greiner 1998 ; schulz et al . 1998 ) . on the other hand , the point  like soft x  ray component is possibly due to scattering of the nuclear radiation ( komossa et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a direct measurement of the nuclear luminosity is needed to assess the relative importance of agn and starburst emission . the only way to do that is to explore the hard x  ray band , which may reveal the direct nuclear component .",
    "if the absorbing matter is moderately thick to compton scattering ( i.e. @xmath8a few@xmath9 @xmath1 ) , the photons emerge above 10 kev , where the most sensitive instrument presently available is the pds onboard _ beppo_sax .",
    "this has already added two sources ( circinus galaxy , matt et al .",
    "1999 ; mrk  3 , cappi et al . 1999 ) to the small list of  moderately  thick \" seyfert 2s , which was previously composed of only one object , ngc  4945 ( iwasawa et al .",

    "_ beppo_sax ( boella et al . 1997 ) observed ngc  6240 on 1998 august 1417 . in this paper ,",
    "data from three instruments are discussed : the lecs ( 0.110 kev ) , the mecs ( 1.510 kev ) , and the pds ( 13300 kev ) .",
    "data reduction and analysis follow the standard criteria , as described in matt et al .",
    "the total effective exposure time was 52.5 ks in the lecs , 119.4 ks in the mecs and 114.4 ks in the pds .",
    "we accumulated and examined images for the mecs instruments . comparing the radial profiles in three energy ranges ( 1.54 , 47.5 , 7.510 kev ) with the corresponding point spread function",
    ", no evidence for extended emission is found .",
    "light curves and spectra were extracted within regions of 4@xmath10 and of 2@xmath10 radius centered on the source for mecs and lecs , respectively ( the small lecs extraction radius is chosen to avoid contamination from a nearby , soft source , not visible in the mecs ) .",
    "the light curves are consistent with being constant .",
    "the resulting count rate is ( 8.46@xmath110.67)@xmath1210@xmath13 counts s@xmath3 ( 0.14.5 kev ) for the lecs and ( 2.46@xmath110.07)@xmath1210@xmath14 counts s@xmath3 ( 1.510 kev ) in the mecs .",
    "no significant variability was found in the pds light ",
    "curve either , with a count rate of 0.38@xmath110.04 counts s@xmath3 .",
    "we restricted the spectral analysis to the 0.14.5 kev and 1.510 kev energy bands for lecs and mecs respectively , where the latest released ( september 1997 ) response matrices are best calibrated .",
    "standard blank  sky files provided by the _ beppo_sax science data center ( sdc ) were used for the background subtraction .",
    "in fig . 1 we compare the @xmath152 kev spectra of ngc  6240 and ngc  1068 .",
    "both spectra have been normalized to the crab spectrum ; since the latter is a power law with photon index @xmath16 2 , we are basically showing the @xmath17 spectrum .",
    "the mecs spectra of the two sources are similar in shape , not surprisingly as we know that in this energy range both sources have been successfully fitted by two reflection components , warm and cold ( e.g. iwasawa et al .",
    "1997 ; iwasawa & comastri 1998 ) .",
    "while below 10 kev the flux of ngc  6240 is the lowest , the opposite occurs in the pds band . clearly , in ngc  6240 a new component emerges at high energies .",
    "no known bright sources are present in the field of view of the pds , and the probability of a serendipitous source in the @xmath18 pds field with a flux equal or larger than that of ngc  6240 is @xmath19 , if the 210 kev asca logn  logs ( cagnoni et al .",
    "1998 ) is adopted , and a power law spectrum with photon index 1.8 is assumed .",
    "thus the best explanation for this component is nuclear emission piercing through an absorber with column density @xmath20 a few@xmath1210@xmath21 cm @xmath14 , i.e. compton  thick but still permitting partial transmission above @xmath610 kev . in fig .  2 ,",
    "the broad band spectrum is fitted following iwasawa & comastri ( 1998 ) : an excess is evident in the pds band .",
    "we therefore modeled the continuum above 2 kev with : _ i _ ) a power law , representing the intrinsic emission , with a photon index fixed at a typical value of @xmath22=1.8 , absorbed by a column density allowed to be free ( leaving the index as a free parameter , a value consistent with the adopted one , but very loosely constrained , is found ) ; _ ii _ ) a second , unabsorbed power law with the same index , standing for the warm reflection component ; _ iii _ ) a pure cold reflection component ( pexrav model in xspec ) generated by a power law with the same index .",
    "as we are interested here in the high energies , and because below 2 kev asca is superior to _ beppo_sax as far as both sensitivity and spectral resolution are concerned , we content ourselves with adopting in this band the best fitting model of iwasawa & comastri ( 1998 ) .",
    "it consists of a multi - temperature optically thin plasma , which probably originates in a powerful starburst .",
    "in particular we use a two  temperature mekal model , where the absorption of the coldest mekal was fixed at the galactic value ( n@xmath23 = 5.8@xmath12 10@xmath24 @xmath1 ) , while the absorption of the other mekal was allowed to be a free parameter .",
    "we applied the latter absorption to all the agn components .",
    "the envisaged scenario is then one in which an external starburst region , associated with the cooler mekal component , absorbs emission from the inner regions of ngc  6240 ( e.g. fabian el al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "a prominent and broad iron k line complex , very similar to that seen in ngc  1068 , is also evident .",
    "because of this similarity we assume that the line is actually a blend of : the 6.4 kev k@xmath25 and 7.06 kev k@xmath26 fluorescent lines from cold iron ( the intensity of the latter has been forced to be equal to 1/9 that of the former , as expected from atomic physics ) ; the 6.7 and 6.97 k@xmath25 recombination lines from he and h  like iron . in summary the complete model , @xmath27 , we used to fit our data",
    "can be written as : @xmath28 + m_{\\rm c}\\},\\ ] ] where : @xmath29 is the absorption associated with the galactic column , @xmath30 is the absorption related to the starburst , @xmath31 is the absorption acting on the nuclear emission ( including the compton cross section ) , possibly associated with the molecular torus shrouding the nucleus , @xmath32 is the power ",

    "1997 ) , the fit is significantly worse ( @xmath66  dof ; see fig .  2 ) .",
    "it must be noted that the absorber of the nuclear emission , @xmath31 , is compton  thick . a proper model , including compton scattering within the matter ( see matt et al . 1999 and matt , pompilio & la franca 1999 for details on this model ) should have then been used , if this absorber has a significant covering factor ( as for example for a torus geometry with no significant vertical density gradient ) .",
    "when this is done , however , the parameters of the various components do not differ significantly from those obtained with the simpler model , apart from the flux associated with the intrinsic emission , which turns out to be about one third that reported in table 1 .",
    "this is because a fraction of the photons emitted towards other directions are now scattered into the line of sight , and the nuclear luminosity required to explain the observed flux is therefore lower .    the same fit but without @xmath34 is also acceptable ( @xmath67  dof ) .",
    "in this case , the observed 6.4 kev iron line would entirely originate in the thick absorbing medium , which is possible provided that the covering factor is not much smaller than unity , as we have verified by monte carlo simulations .",
    "therefore , the presence of the cold reflection component is not certain in this source .",
    "if @xmath33 is instead excluded , the fit is significantly worse ( @xmath68  dof ) .",
    "the main result of the _ beppo_sax observation of ngc  6240 is the discovery and measurement of the nuclear emission .",
    "the 210 kev nuclear luminosity , after correction for absorption , is 3.6@xmath1210@xmath69 erg s@xmath3 ( assuming @xmath70=50 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) , or about one third of this if the absorber covers a large solid angle , like in a torus .    as discussed above ,",
    "the presence of cold reflection is not unambiguously established in this source .",
    "let us , however , assume that it does exist , and take the best fitting parameters listed in table  1 .",
    "the ratio between the 210 kev cold reflection and intrinsic fluxes is about 0.3% for the higher value of the intrinsic luminosity and 3 times larger for the lower value . assuming a torus geometry like that adopted by ghisellini , haardt & matt ( 1994 ) , and consistently the lower figure for the intrinsic luminosity",
    ", we derive an inclination angle of the torus axis with respect to the observer of @xmath635@xmath71 ( @xmath645@xmath71 if the upper figure is instead adopted ) .",
    "it is worth noting that both ngc 6240 and circinus galaxy ( guainazzi et al .",
    "1999 ) appear to be observed at moderate inclinations , while ngc 1068 , which is totally obscured , is possibly seen almost edge - on ( greenhill et al . 1996 , matt et al . 1997 ; but see kishimoto 1999 for a different point of view ) .",
    "this would suggest a decrease in the density of the x ",
    "ray absorbing medium with increasing distance from the equatorial plane .",
    "the ratio between 210 kev warm reflection and intrinsic fluxes is about 0.5% ( 1.5% for the lower luminosity ) .",
    "the he and h  like lines have ew with respect to the warm reflection component of about 1 and 0.8 kev , respectively . from these values",
    "we estimate the column density of the warm mirror ( e.g. matt , fabian & brandt 1996 ; guainazzi et al .",
