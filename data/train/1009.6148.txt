    "a long - standing dichotomy in nebular astrophysics is that the heavy element abundances derived from optical recombination lines ( orls ) are systematically higher than those derived from collisionally excited lines ( cels ; see peimbert & peimbert 2006 and liu 2006 for recent reviews ) .",
    "temperature fluctuations ( peimbert 1967 ) , density inhomogeneities ( rubin 1989 ; viegas & clegg 1994 ) and x - ray irradiation of quasineutral chemically homogeneous clumps ( ercolano 2009 ) have been proposed to explain this discrepancy . however , extensive observations of planetary nebulae ( pne ) have shown that they are incapable of accounting for all observational features ( liu 2006 ) . in order to explain the cel / orl abundance dichotomy , liu et al .",
    "( 2000 , l2000 hereafter ) presented a bi - abundance model .",
    "the model assumed that the nebula contains two gas components of different abundances  the diffuse component of `` normal '' composition that dominates the emission of cels and another consisting of cold h - deficient inclusions posited in the diffuse gas that dominates the emission of orls .",
    "the model explains well spectroscopic observations from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "however , detailed photoionization models are still required to test this scenario and address issues such as : ` how can the nebular physical conditions and its elemental abundances be reliably determined in the exiseence of chemical inhomogeneities ? ' , and ` what is the nature and origin of the h - deficient clumps ? ' to address these issues , this paper presents the results of three - dimensional photoionization modelling for the pn ngc6153 .",
    "ngc6153 is an archetypal nebula showing a particularly large orl versus cel abundance discrepancy factor ( adf ) of about ten ( l2000 ) .",
    "a large number of orls from a variety of heavy - element ions have been detected in this pn .",
    "ngc6153 is thus an ideal object to model and to investigate the possible causes of the cel / orl abundance discrepancy problem .",
    "early optical studies by pottasch et al .",
    "( 1984 , 1986 ) suggested that ngc6153 has a very high metallicity .",
    "the result was further corroborated by the observations of the short wavelength spectrometer on board the infrared space observatory ( _ iso_-sws ) in the mid - ir ( pottasch et al .",
    "l2000 presented a comprehensive spectroscopic analysis of ngc6153 from the uv to the far - ir and found that the c , n , o , and ne abundances derived from orls are about ten times higher than those derived from cels . using simple empirical models",
    ", l2000 showed that the discrepancy can be explained by assuming the existence of a h - deficient component embedded in the diffuse gas . using optical integral field spectroscopic observations of three pne including ngc6153 with the very large telescope fibre large array multi element spectrograph argus integral field unit , tsamis et al .",
    "( 2008 ) provided further evidence for the existence of cold h - deficient inclusions and constrained their physical sizes to be smaller than @xmath21,000 astronomical units .",
    "pquignot et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) constructed one - dimensional photoionization models that contain two gas components of different abundances .",
    "the models reproduced satisfactorily most of the observed spectral features of ngc6153 .",
    "it is however difficult to self - consistently treat the diffuse radiation fields in one - dimensional models and investigate the size and spatial distribution of the postulated h - deficient clumps .",
    "this motivated us to carry out further modelling using the monte carlo photoionization code mocassin ( ercolano et al .",
    "2003a , 2005 , 2008 ) capable of dealing with an arbitrary nebular geometry and density and abundance distributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "previous modelling work and observational data used to constrain our models are summarized . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the code used for the modelling and present the modelling results . in section 4 , we discuss the implications and limitation of our results , the properties of the h - deficient inclusions and their impacts on nebular studies .",
    "a summary is given in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we summarize observations available to constrain the photoionization models of ngc6153 and introduce the earlier one - dimensional bi - abundance work of pquignot et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) , which serves as the starting point of our new three - dimensional models .",
    "spectra of ngc6153 from the uv to the far - ir are available from the literature ( e.g. , l2000 , pottasch et al .",
    "1984 , 1986 , 2003 ) . for a given wavelength range",
    ", there may exist more than one set of observations . due to varying aperture sizes , orientations and measurement uncertainties ,",
    "different studies often obtain different fluxes for a given emission line . for the current work ,",
    "we have adopted line fluxes of l2000 , who present measurements in the optical obtained with ground - based facilities , in the uv obtained with the international ultraviolet explorer ( _ iue _ ; 11503300 ) , and in the mid- to far ir obtained with the infrared astronomical satellite ( _ iras_;7.622.7@xmath3 m ) and the long wavelength spectrometer on board the _ iso _ ( _ iso_-lws ; 43197@xmath3 m ) .",
    "l2000 obtained two sets of optical spectra .",
    "the set of spectra with the slit oriented along the nebular minor axis allows one to investigate the spatial brightness distribution of a given line along the slit .",
    "the other set , obtained by scanning the slit across the whole nebular surface , when combined with the total h@xmath4 flux [ @xmath5@xmath6(h@xmath4 )  = @xmath710.86ergs  @xmath8s@xmath9 ; cahn et al .",
    "1992 ] , yields integrated fluxes of the whole nebula for all the detected lines .",
    "the integrated line fluxes can be directly compared with the model predictions .",
    "note that l2000 used a logarithmic extinction , _",
    "c_(h@xmath4 )  =  1.30 , deduced from the balmer decrement , * and the galactic reddening law of howarth ( 1983 ) * to deredden the uv , optical and near - ir spectra .",
    "they adopted a different value _",
    "c_(h@xmath4 )  =  1.19 , deduced from the observed radio continuum flux density and the h@xmath4  flux , to deredden the mid- and far - ir spectra .",
    "the same dereddening algorithm has been used in the current study .",
    "here we have added a few mid - ir cels falling within the spectral window of the _ iso_-sws in our modelling .",
    "given the fact that the size of the _",
    "iso_-sws diaphragm was not large enough to cover the entire nebula and the telescope pointing was offset by @xmath10 east and @xmath11 south of the nebular centre , aperture corrections have been applied by comparing the line fluxes obtained with _ iso_-sws and those with _",
    "iras_. all strong emission lines considered in the previous modelling ( l2000 , pquignot et al .",
    "2003 ) were included in the current work , c.f . the next section for details .",
    "in addition to line fluxes from the literature , we have supplemented the data with new observations using the b&c spectrograph mounted on the european southern observatory ( eso ) 1.52 m telescope .",
    "the spectra , obtained on 2001 may 12 , were taken in order to measure several near - ir emission lines ( he  i @xmath1210830 , [ c  i ] @xmath129850 , and [ s  iii ] @xmath12@xmath129069,9531 ) , important for model constraints .",
    "the he  i @xmath1210830 line is particularly important to constrain the helium abundance in a bi - abundance model ( c.f . section 4.1 ) .",
    "the spectra covered the wavelength range 770013254 , with the slit placed along the nebular minor axis .",
    "two long exposures , each of 1800s , and one short exposure of 300s were made .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the long92 package in midas following the standard procedures .",
    "the spectra were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , cosmic rays cleaned and wavelength - calibrated using exposures of a he - ar calibration lamp .",
    "they were then flux - calibrated with the iraf package using wide - slit observations of _ hst _ standard stars .",
    "after dereddening , the spectra were normalized such that hi  _",
    "i_(p12)/_i_(h@xmath4 )  =  0.01106 , as predicted by the recombination theory , caseb ( storey & hummer 1995 ) for @xmath13  =  6,080 k and @xmath14  =  3,500 @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath13  and @xmath14  values here are taken from l2000 .",
    "fluxes deduced from these observations are tabulated in table  1 ( see section  3 ) .    in an attempt to detect directly the postulated h - deficient knots and to constrain their physical sizes ,",
    "we have also carried out long - slit spectroscopy of ngc6153 using the stis instrument on board the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) . on 2002",
    "june 34 , two gratings , g430 m and g750 m , were used to cover the spectral range @xmath12@xmath123050 - 5600 and @xmath12@xmath125450 - 10100 , respectively .",
    "a long slit of @xmath16 was placed along the nebular minor axis through the central star to cover the brightest parts of the nebula .",
    "the spatial resolution along the slit was @xmath17/pixel .",
    "the standard pipeline procedures in iraf / stsdas were used to reduce the data .",
    "unfortunately , these data suffered from poor signal - to - noise ratio as well as severe contamination by cosmic rays and turned out to be of very limited value for the current investigation ( see section 4.4 ) .    [ modelresults ]",

    "we performed aperture photometry and found that h@xmath25  and [ o  iii ]  @xmath125007 line fluxes deduced from _",
    "images agreed within 10 per cent with the corresponding values yielded by the optical scanning spectrum of l2000 , suggesting insignificant contamination to the _ hst _ f656n image from the [ n  ii ]  lines and the nebular continuum emission .",
    "the azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness distribution of h@xmath25  was deduced from the _ hst _ f656n image and plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "the profile is used in our models to constrain the nebular density distribution .",
    "[ sphfluxdist ]      previous empirical and one - dimensional photoionization models of ngc6153 provide valuable insight and a useful guide for setting the initial parameters of the new 3d photoionization models .",
    "l2000 constructed several parametrized empirical models to match the observed fluxes of selected orls and cels .",
    "recombination contributions to cels were considered .",
    "they obtained the following results : 1 ) models of a uniform chemical composition and density distribution can not reproduce the large strengths of orls ; 2 ) chemically homogeneous models with density variations predict too weak orls and the hydrogen balmer discontinuity and a too strong [ ne  iii ] fine - structure line compared to observations ; and 3 ) bi - abundance models consisting of two components , each with a different temperature , density , and chemical composition , can account for most of the observed patterns of ngc6153 .",
    "two different bi - abundance models were presented by l2000 .",
    "one assumed some low - density ( @xmath14@xmath30= 700 @xmath15 ) and low - temperature ( @xmath13@xmath30= 500 k ) h - deficient material embedded in the `` normal '' nebular gas of @xmath14@xmath30= 5,500 @xmath15 and @xmath13@xmath30= 9,500 k. in the other model , the hydrogen - depleted material was assumed to be fully ionized and have a high density ( @xmath31 @xmath15 ) and a moderate temperature of 4,700k . in both models ,",
    "the helium and heavy element abundances with respect to hydrogen in the h - deficient component were respectively @xmath32 and@xmath33 times higher than the corresponding values in the diffuse gas .",
    "pquignot et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) constructed detailed bi - abundance photoionization models of ngc6153 using the one - dimensional code nebu .",
    "their models were composed of sectors extracted from a number of spherically symmetric models , each made of different input parameters except the central ionizing source . in the models , a h - deficient component with a small filling factor was mixed with a normal - composition shell .",
    "they found that models containing a small amount of dense , cold h - deficient material [ @xmath34 = 0.0031@xmath35 , @xmath36 = 4410 @xmath15 , @xmath13@xmath30= 1390 k ] in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding gas of `` normal '' composition [ @xmath34 = 0.38@xmath35 , @xmath37 = 1170 @xmath15 , @xmath13@xmath30= 9040 k ] can well account for the observed fluxes of most orls and cels .",
    "compared to the normal gas , the h - deficient component is enhanced in helium and cnone elements by factors of 6 and 100 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , the average elemental abundances of the entire nebula are only slightly affected by the presence of the h - deficient component , given its small mass .",
    "pquignot et al .",
    "( 2002 ) pointed out that helium abundance relative to hydrogen will be overestimated if composition fluctuations are not taken into account and it is also essential to consider collisional contribution to excitation of he  i  lines to correctly determine helium abundance .",
    "the modelling is carried out using mocassin ( version 2.02.12 ; ercolano et al . 2003a , 2005 ) ,",
    "a fully three - dimensional monte carlo photoionization code that solves the radiative transfer self - consistently in an iterative way and is designed to tackle problems involving density variations and chemical inhomogeneities .",
    "the code is therefore suitable for the current investigation aiming to study the effects of the complicated geometry and possible chemical inhomogeneities of ngc6153 . to reduce degree of freedom , the ionizing star is assumed to have a blackbody spectral energy distribution in our models .",
    "a more realistic representation of the ionizing star is left to a later work .",
    "the nebula is approximated by a cubical cartesian grid of cells of individually pre - defined density and chemical composition .",
    "for each cell , the radiation fields ( including the stellar and the diffuse component ) and physical conditions ( electron temperature , density and ionic fractions of all elements considered ) are calculated iteratively . based on an initial guess of the temperature and ionization structures , the code calculates radiation fields , solves the ionization and thermal equilibrium equations and then updates the temperature and ionization structures .",
    "this process is iterated until physical conditions are converged in most cells .",
    "finally , the emission spectrum of the model nebula is calculated by integrating over the volume of the nebula .",
    "the code has been applied to construct photoionization models of the pn ngc3918 , the h - deficient knots in the `` born - again '' pn abell30 , the wolf - rayet pn ngc1501 ( ercolano et al . 2003b , c , 2004 ) and pn ngc6781 ( schwarz & monteiro , 2006 ) .    in our models , we have assumed that ngc6153 has an azimuthally symmetrical structure in the x and y plane and a reflection symmetry in z and placed the central star at the centre of a corner cell of a @xmath38 cubic grid .",
    "modelling in this way can effectively save the computational time since only one eighth of the nebula is simulated .",
    "the _ hst _ images of ngc6153 show that the nebula can be approximated by an ellipsoidal shell with enhanced emission in the equator .",
    "the brightest part of the nebula exhibits point symmetry with respect to the central star , probably implying the existence of an ellipsoidal ring lying along the major axis in the south - east to the north - west direction .",
    "a faint halo can also be seen surrounding the bright nebula . in order to better constrain the input parameters ,",
    "we have constructed a series of models with progressively increasing complexity .",
    "these include a spherical model ( model s ) , two ellipsoidal models without and with a torus ( models e1 and e2 , respectively ) , and a bi - abundance model ( model b ) .",
    "the spherical and ellipsoidal models are chemically homogeneous .",
    "table  2 gives the adopted model parameters that yield the best match to the observations . in table  1 , we compare the predicted line fluxes with the observations .",

    "given that adf values measured for pne are always larger than unity , h - deficient inclusions are presumably a genuine feature of pne .",
    "their presence in pne is however not predicted by current theories of stellar evolution . while it has been proposed ( iben et al .",
    "1983 ) that an evolved star undergoing a very late helium flash ( the so called `` born - again '' pne ) may harbor h - deficient material , the central stars of most pne exhibiting large adf s are found not to be h - deficient .",
    "hydrogen - deficient knots have been clearly detected in the two `` born - again '' pne , abell30 and abell58 .",
    "on the other hand , wesson et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2008 ) found that the h - deficient knots in abell30 and abell 58 are oxygen - rich , in contrast to the expectation of the `` born - again '' scenario .",
    "their chemical composition has more in common with neon novae than with sakurai s object .",
    "the latter is believed to have recently experienced a final he - shell flash .",
    "lau et al .",
    "( in preparation ) explore the possibility of binary evolution to account for the observed high oxygen and neon abundances of the h - deficient knots in abell58 , assuming that the knots are from the ejecta of a neon nova explosion .",
    "they consider a number of scenarios but none fit perfectly with the observations .",
    "their best scenario consists of binary stars where the primary one white dwarf provided the neon nova explosion and the secondary asymptotic giant branch star evolved into the pn .",
    "this scenario requires very fine - tuned initial conditions , particularly the initial separation , to make the neon nova occur just after the final flash of the secondary asymptotic giant branch companion .",
    "therefore , this scenario does not predict a large number of pne with h - deficient knots .",
    "another conjecture is that the h - deficient inclusions are evaporating solid bodies , such as metal - rich planetesimals formed in planetary disks ( liu et al .",
    "this scenario has been subsequently investigated by henney & stasiska ( 2010 ) , who show that the destruction of solid bodies during the short pn phase itself is not able to provide enough metal - rich material to explain the observed cel / orl abundance discrepancies , due to a low sputtering rate . on the other hand",
    ", the sublimation of solid bodies during the final stages of the asymptotic giant branch phase , which is much longer than the pn phase , might provide enough metal - rich material and serve as a possible mechanism causing the abundance discrepancies .",
    "although other explanations to the ( moderate ) adf of hiirs are still possible , the h - deficient inclusions may also be present in h  ii regions ( tsamis et al .",
    "2003 ; tsamis & pquignot , 2005 ) .",
    "they could be supernovae ejecta in the form of metal - rich droplets that fall back into the interstellar medium after a long journey lasting about 10@xmath41 yr ( stasiska et al .",
    "they might also originate from evaporating proto - planetary disks around newly formed stars , such as the proplyds discovered in the orion nebula .",
    "we have constructed detailed three - dimensional photoionization models of ngc6153 of spherical or ellipsoidal geometry , with and without h - deficient inclusions .",
    "the model results are compared with spectroscopic observations from the uv , optical to the far ir as well as narrow - band imaging observations . in those models ,",
    "the main nebula is assumed to be chemically homogeneous and of a `` normal '' composition .",
    "the spherical model can reproduce the strengths of hydrogen and helium recombination lines and of high excitation cels . in order to explain the strengths of low - excitation cels , we have considered an ellipsoidal shell where the density decreases from the equator to the poles , supplemented with an equatorial torus having the same chemical composition but of a higher density .",
    "the chemically homogeneous ellipsoidal model with a torus reproduces the strengths of all cels within the measurement uncertainties , but fails by an order of magnitude for heavy element orls . in all cases ,",
    "chemically homogeneous models yield small temperature fluctuations , and are therefore incapable to explain the large discrepancy between @xmath42})$ ] and @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast , a bi - abundance model , incorporating small - scale chemical inhomogeneities in the form of a small amount of metal - rich inclusions , not only reproduces the strengths of heavy element orls and the hydrogen balmer discontinuity , but also improves the overall fitting of cels .    in our best - fit bi - abundance model , the cnone abundances in the metal - rich knots are enhanced by 40100 times compared to those of the main nebula .",
    "the presence of those metal - rich knots increases the average metal content of the whole nebula by 30 per cent .",
    "optical / uv cels arise mainly from the main diffuse nebula of `` normal '' composition and thus probe the physical conditions and chemical abundances of this component .",
    "ir cels originate from both components , and thus yield elemental abundances higher than optical / uv cels but lower than orls .",
    "in addition , temperatures deduced from ir cels tend to be lower than values deduced from optical / uv cels .",
    "for he  i  lines , although a large fraction of their fluxes arises from the h - deficient component , given the relatively low abundance enhancement factor of about 5 , the helium abundance of the normal component remains a fair representation of the average value of the whole nebula .",
    "nevertheless , in the presence of h - deficient inclusions , the traditional analysis assuming a single uniform chemical composition for the whole nebula , will greatly overestimate the helium abundances of the normal component .",
    "one should bear in mind that in the current work we were unable to separate helium emission originating from the two components to obtain reliable estimates of the helium abundance in each of the two components .",
    "indeed , we have assumed he / h @xmath44 for the normal component .",
    "the collisional excitation dominant he  i  @xmath12  10830 line can , in principle , be used to estimate the helium abundance in the normal component .",
    "its usage is however hampered by observational and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the electron temperature inside the metal - rich knots is as low as 800k .",
    "the main coolants are ir fine - structure lines from heavy element ions , including the [ o  iii ]  52 , 88@xmath3 m , the [ ne  iii ]  15.6 , 36@xmath3 m and [ ne  ii ]  12.8@xmath3 m lines .",
    "the metal - rich knots have a high density , and are roughly in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding `` normal '' gas .",
    "the metal - rich knots weaken and soften the uv radiation field .",
    "the cometary tails of `` normal '' gas behind the knots have relatively low temperatures and ionization degrees .    we show that the presence of metal - rich knots may lead to significant errors in nebular properties derived from the traditional methods assuming a single nebular component .",
    "we discuss physical and chemical properties of the metal - rich knots in ngc6153 as well as their possible origins . to better constrain the nature of metal - rich knots in pne , new observations and techniques are useful .",
    "for example , both imaging and spectroscopic observations of ir fine - structure lines at high spatial resolution and sensitivity will certainly shed new insight into the properties of these metal - rich knots . in future work",
    ", we plan to develop more comprehensive methods to probe these cold knots by involving more observational features ( e.g. he  i discontinuities ; zhang et al . 2005a , 2009 ) and up - to - date recombination coefficients of orls for low - temperature plasma ( fang et al .",
    "in preparation ) . we will also construct detailed three - dimensional models for more pne exhibiting large adf s with resolved metal - rich knots , such as m  1 - 42 .",
