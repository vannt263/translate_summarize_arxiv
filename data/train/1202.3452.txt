    "this `` emc effect '' was discovered in 1982 in the cross section ratios of iron to deuterium @xcite and confirmed by many measurements on a range of nuclei @xcite .",
    "the latest data @xcite show that for light nuclei the emc effect does not increase monotonically with increasing average nuclear density .",
    "while there is no generally accepted explanation of the emc effect , proposed explanations generally need to include both nuclear structure effects ( momentum distributions and binding energy ) and modification of the bound nucleon structure .",
    "a recent paper showed a strong correlation between the magnitude of the emc effect and the short range correlations ( src ) scaling factor @xcite . because the per - nucleon cross section ratios of nuclei to deuterium for @xmath8 decrease approximately linearly with @xmath12 , in this range of @xmath12 the emc effect can be quantified by the slope of this ratio , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the src scaling factor , @xmath1 , equals the ratio of the per - nucleon inclusive electron scattering cross section for nucleus @xmath14 to deuterium at @xmath15 ( gev / c)@xmath7 and @xmath16 . in this range of @xmath12 ,",
    "the cross section ratio is constant @xcite .",
    "the constancy of the ratio in this range of @xmath12 is attributed to high - momentum components of the nuclear wave function .",
    "these high momentum components have been shown to be almost entirely due to central and tensor nucleon - nucleon short range correlations @xcite .",
    "this correlation between the magnitude of the emc effect measured at @xmath8 and the src scale factor measured at @xmath16 was used to phenomenologically determine the ratio of the dis cross section for a proton and neutron bound in deuterium to the dis cross section for free ( unbound ) @xmath17 pair and thus to determine the free neutron cross section for @xmath8 .",
    "the free neutron cross section was then used to determine the ratio of the neutron to proton structure function , @xmath18 and hence the ratio of @xmath19 in this range of @xmath12 .",
    "recently , high precision measurements of the per nucleon inclusive electron scattering cross section ratio for different nuclei relative to deuterium at @xmath20 ( gev / c)@xmath7 and @xmath21 were published  @xcite , covering more nuclei at greater precision than previous measurements",
    ". these ratios also show scaling behavior for @xmath22 .",
    "this new data allows us to reexamine the observed linear correlation between the strength of the emc effect and the src scaling factor  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the new data also includes various corrections to the measured cross section ratios that were not included in previous analyses  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the consistency of the old and new data and the effects of different corrections to the cross section ratios and therefore on the slope of the emc - src correlation .",

    "the linearity of the emc - src correlation , regardless of the exact corrections considered , is a clear indication of the robustness of the emc - src correlation .",
