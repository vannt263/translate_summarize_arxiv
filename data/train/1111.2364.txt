    "this paper is motivated by several difficulties concerning to greater or lesser extent the `` topology of leaves '' that are encountered in the study of some well - known problems about ( singular ) holomorphic foliations .",
    "yet most of these problems are essentially concerned with pseudogroups generated by certain local holomorphic diffeomorphisms defined on a neighborhood of @xmath0 .",
    "for this reason , we shall begin our discussion by stating our results in this context .",
    "first consider the group @xmath2 of germs of diffeomorphisms and let this group be equipped with the _ analytic topology _ introduced by takens @xcite .",
    "the precise definition of this topology will be given in section  2 , for the time being it suffices to know that it possesses the baire property .",
    "here we remind the reader that a @xmath3-dense set , sometimes also called a residual set , is nothing but a countable intersection of open and dense sets in a baire space .",
    "all the `` generic results '' stated in this part of the introduction concern @xmath3-dense sets for this topology .",
    "it is however worth pointing out that , once they are established , it is easy to derive the `` generic '' character in other contexts by means of ideas similar to those employed in section  2 ( in particular in suitable topologies involving the coefficients of their taylor series at @xmath0 and/or in the sense of measure ) .",
    "next consider a @xmath4-tuple of local holomorphic diffeomorphisms @xmath5 fixing @xmath0 .",
    "the first theorem proved here states that we can perturb the @xmath6 s _ without altering their classes of holomorphic conjugacy in @xmath2 _ so that the group they generate is the free product of the corresponding cyclic groups .",
    "the reason for keeping the conjugacy class fixed will be clear when we shall discuss the applications to singular foliations . for the time being , note only that this condition is equivalent to preserving the order of a diffeomorphism if this order is finite .",
    "also , in the case of a diffeomorphism having a hyperbolic fixed point at @xmath0 , the condition amounts to preserving the corresponding multiplier .",
    "next let @xmath7 denote the product of @xmath4-copies of @xmath2 endowed with the product analytic topology .",
    "then we have :    * theorem a*.    _ suppose that @xmath5 as above are such that none of the @xmath6 s has finite order ( i.e. @xmath8 for every @xmath9 )",
    ". then there exists a @xmath3-dense set @xmath10 such that , whenever @xmath11 the group generated by @xmath12 induces a free group in @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , there is a fixed neighborhood @xmath13 of @xmath0 such that , denoting by @xmath14 the pseudogroup of mappings defined on @xmath13 by @xmath15 , every element of @xmath14 coinciding with the identity on a non - empty open set must coincide with the identity on all of its domain of definition in @xmath13 .",
    "_    finally there are infinitely many points @xmath16 contained in @xmath13 such that @xmath17 is a hyperbolic fixed point of some element @xmath18 of @xmath14 and the orbits under @xmath14 of @xmath17 and @xmath19 are disjoint provided that @xmath20 .",
    "the assumption that the order of each @xmath6 is infinite does not constitute a limitation of our methods .",
    "in fact , let @xmath21 be the cyclic group generated by @xmath6 ( which may or may not be infinite ) .",
    "theorem  b below is formally a generalization of theorem  a whereas our methods actually yield a unified proof of both statements .",
    "* theorem b*.    _ let @xmath5 and @xmath22 be as above .",
    "then there exists a @xmath3-dense set @xmath10 such that , whenever @xmath11 the group generated by @xmath12 induces a group in @xmath2 that is isomorphic to the free product @xmath23 furthermore , there is a fixed neighborhood @xmath13 of @xmath0 such that , denoting by @xmath14 the pseudogroup of mappings defined on @xmath13 by @xmath15 , every element of @xmath14 coinciding with the identity on a non - empty open set must coincide with the identity on all of its domain of definition in @xmath13 .",
    "_    finally there are infinitely many points @xmath16 contained in @xmath13 such that @xmath17 is a hyperbolic fixed point of some element @xmath18 of @xmath14 and the orbits under @xmath14 of @xmath17 and @xmath19 are disjoint provided that @xmath20 .    for the last part of the preceding statements , we note that the existence of a hyperbolic fixed point for the pseudogroup arising from a `` non - solvable '' group has been known since @xcite , @xcite whereas the existence of two or more hyperbolic fixed points with disjoint orbits was not previously settled .",
    "it appears here as a consequence of our theory of generic pseudogroups .",
    "it is natural to expect the preceding statements to have consequences on the topology of the leaves of a foliation on a neighborhood of an invariant curve or on a neighborhood of a singular point . in this paper",
    "we shall content ourselves of providing an answer to the long - standing question of nilpotent singularities leaving a cusp of the form @xmath24 invariant . by a small abuse of language , by a cusp of the form",
    "@xmath25 it will always be meant a ( local ) curve analytically equivalent to the cusp in question .",
    "this choice will help us to explain most of the relevant ideas without making the discussion too technical . to begin with consider a singular foliation @xmath26 defined about @xmath27 by a nilpotent @xmath28-form @xmath29 and possessing a cusp @xmath25 as its unique separatrix .",
    "it then follows that the linear part of @xmath26 at the origin is nilpotent ( and non - zero ) .",
    "this much studied class of singularities corresponds to arnold s singularities of type @xmath30 .",
    "whereas several works were devoted to these nilpotent singularities , and in particular to the description of suitable normal forms ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , the question about the topology of most leaves for the `` generic foliation '' remained unsettled .",
    "our theorem  c below states that for a generic foliation in the class @xmath30 there are only a countable ( infinite ) number of leaves that are not simply connected .",
    "generic theorems about foliations , as it is the case of theorem  c , are more commonly expressed in terms of the krull topology since the corresponding formulations automatically bear a meaning in terms of `` generic coefficients '' for the differential equation in question .",
    "this explains why theorem  c will be stated with respect to the krull topology rather than being `` parameterized '' by @xmath3-dense sets in @xmath2 ( yet a formulation in terms of @xmath3-dense sets is possible , cf .",
    "section  5 for details ) .",
    "let @xmath31 be a @xmath28-form with an isolated singularity at the origin and defining a germ of a nilpotent foliation @xmath26 of type @xmath30 .",
    "* theorem c ( cusps)*.    _ for every ( sufficiently large ) @xmath32 , there exists a @xmath28-form @xmath33 defining a germ of a foliation @xmath34 and satisfying the following conditions : _",
    "* @xmath35 ( i.e. the forms @xmath36 are tangent to order @xmath37 at the origin ) . *",
    "the foliations @xmath26 and @xmath34 have @xmath38 as a common separatrix .",
    "* there exists a fundamental system of open neighborhoods @xmath39 of @xmath38 , inside a closed ball @xmath40 , such that for all @xmath41 , the leaves of the restriction of @xmath34 to @xmath42 are simply connected except for a countable number of them .    to apply theorems",
    "a and  b to the topology of leaves of foliations in more general settings is a quite subtle problem for which the theory developed in @xcite becomes a powerful tool . concerning our theorem  c , a self - contained proof is given in section  5 .",
    "this proof , however , amounts to applying the techniques of @xcite to an elementary case .",
    "another comment about theorem  c is that , though it is naturally constructed , the systems of neighborhoods @xmath43 can not be arbitrary .",
    "in fact , for an arbitrary neighborhood @xmath44 it may happen , for example , that intersections of leaves with the boundary of @xmath44 create `` holes '' in the corresponding leaves which will no longer be simply connected . in section  5 a result slightly more accurate than theorem  c will be stated .",
    "this section also contains further information and details about these foliations .    to close this introduction",
    "let us make some comments concerning the standard condition that we have considered in theorem  a and  b. namely the fact that the analytic conjugacy class of the initial local diffeomorphisms is always kept fixed .",
    "for this it is interesting to look at a foliation @xmath45 defined on a neighborhood of a rational curve @xmath46 ( in turn embedded in some complex surface ) .",
    "the singularities of @xmath45 in @xmath46 are denoted by @xmath47 .",
    "it is then natural to consider perturbations of @xmath45 satisfying our standard condition : the analytic class of the local holonomy map @xmath48 defined by a small loop around @xmath49 is fixed . since the singularities are simple , this condition is equivalent to saying that the _ analytic types _ of the singularities of @xmath45 are fixed , as it follows from classical results . in turn , if in addition these singularities belong to the poincar domain , then our context is equivalent to the context of _ isospectral deformations _ i.e. deformations preserving the eigenvalues of each singular point . for singularities belonging to the siegel domain",
    "however our condition is far stronger than the isospectral one and , in fact , it is expected to be the natural `` good '' condition for developing a ( global ) moduli theory for holomorphic foliations .",
    "finally , when a singularity in the siegel domain gives rise to a local holonomy of finite order , then the condition becomes equivalent to deforming the foliation while keeping fixed the order of the local holonomy maps in question .",
    "this last case is precisely the situation that emerges in the analysis of singularities of type @xmath30 and it will play a role in the proof of theorem  c.    in any event , in a suitable sense , a generic foliation as above will still have all but countably many leaves simply connected",
    ". this assertion may be justified by a construction similar to the construction carried out in section  5 .",
    "alternatively we can resort to more general results obtained in @xcite .",
    "in particular the preceding theorems can be viewed as a step towards anosov s conjecture stating a global result about the existence of only countably many non - simply connected leaves for a generic foliation of the projective plane .",
    "concerning foliations on the projective plane leaving a projective line invariant , ilyashenko and pyartli @xcite proved that , in the class of foliations with degree  @xmath50 of the projective plane leaving the line at infinity invariant , those for which the holonomy group of ( the regular part of ) the line at infinity is free are generic .",
    "this very interesting result has a different nature if compared to statements provided in this work and it deserves some comments . whereas ilyashenko and pyartli do not worry about how the singular points change in their considerations about `` generic foliations '' , one of the main differences between the two works stems from the fact that their theorem is stated for global foliations whose space of parameters is far more restrictive and of finite dimension .",
    "therefore their result does not apply in a singular context , for example in the study of foliations leaving a cusp invariant , not only because the `` parameter space '' is totally different but also because singularities are often `` deformed '' in their procedure .",
    "similarly our construction does not apply in their global context since it is unclear whether our `` perturbations '' can be realized within the natural parameter space associated to ( global ) foliations of degree  @xmath50 .",
    "another issue that needs to be pointed out is that , unfortunately , ilyashenko and pyartli s theorem works only at the `` infinitesimal '' level of the group of germs of diffeomorphisms fixing @xmath0 . due to the reasons explained above ( cf . also section  4 ) , it therefore does not imply the existence of simply connected leaves ( apart from a countable set ) in a fixed neighborhood of the line at infinity . given the interest of this type of question , we may wonder whether a suitable blend of ideas in both papers may lead us to fill in some of the gaps mentioned above and provide further insight into the general case of anosov s conjecture .",
    "finally a word about the structure of the paper . in section",
    "2 we provide the definition of the analytic topology in the context adapted to our needs . for the convenience of the reader a proof that this topology possesses the baire property was also included .",
    "we then provide some general elementary statements comparing formal `` perturbations '' with analytic perturbations that might also be useful in other similar problems . in section",
    "3 we introduce our basic technique of perturbation relying on riemann maps and on caratheodory theorem .",
    "this section ends with the proof of the `` infinitesimal versions '' of theorems  a and  b. in other words we find that we can obtain `` free subgroups '' contained in the group of _ germs _ @xmath2 . in section  4",
    "we elaborate much further on the preceding material so as to be able to prove the full statements of theorems  a and  b along with some simple variants needed for section  5 . in all these sections we deal exclusively with the case where the corresponding groups are generated by only two local diffeomorphisms ( i.e. @xmath51 in the statements of theorems  a and  b ) .",
    "this serves only to abridge notations since the general case does not offer any additional difficulty . finally in section  5 some implications of these theorems to foliations",
    "are discussed and theorem  c is proved .",
    "in the sequel let @xmath2 stands for the group of local holomorphic diffeomorphisms fixing @xmath0 .",
    "the group of formal series @xmath52 , @xmath53 , is going to be denoted by @xmath54 .",
    "there is an obvious injection of @xmath2 in @xmath54 which associates to an element of @xmath2 its taylor series about @xmath0 .",
    "let us begin by defining the so called _ analytic topology _ ( or @xmath55-topology ) in @xmath2 . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this type of topology was first considered by takens @xcite who also observed that it possesses the baire property .    given @xmath56 ,",
    "let @xmath57 denote the open disc of radius @xmath58 about @xmath0 .",
    "consider a holomorphic function @xmath59 defined around @xmath0 and taking values in @xmath60 . if @xmath59 possesses a holomorphic extension ( still denoted by @xmath59 ) to @xmath61 , then set @xmath62 .",
    "otherwise we pose @xmath63 .",
    "next for @xmath64 and @xmath65 chosen , let @xmath66 be the set defined by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is interpreted simply as a holomorphic function that need not be a local diffeomorphism at @xmath0 .",
    "the _ analytic topology _ on @xmath2 can now be defined as being the one generated by the sets @xmath69 . in other words ,",
    "the sets @xmath69 form a _ basis of open sets _ for the analytic topology .",
    "an immediate consequence of this definition is that a sequence @xmath70 is convergent in the analytic topology if and only if , to every pair @xmath64 , there corresponds @xmath32 such that @xmath71 whenever both @xmath72 are greater than @xmath37 .",
    "[ none ] fixed @xmath73 , the @xmath4-jet projection from @xmath2 to @xmath74 defined by @xmath75 is continuous in the analytic topology as an easy consequence of cauchy estimates .",
    "conversely , this projection admits a natural section @xmath76 ( taylor polynomial ) defined by @xmath77 which is also continuous for the topologies in question .",
    "this simple remark will often be used in the course of this work .",
    "following @xcite let us show that the set @xmath2 , endowed with the analytic topology , is a baire space .",
    "[ takens ] the group @xmath2 equipped with the analytic topology is a baire space , namely the countable intersection of open dense sets is dense .    for every @xmath78 ,",
    "let @xmath79 denote an open and dense subset of @xmath2 . given a nonempty open set @xmath80",
    ", we must check that @xmath81 .",
    "clearly it suffices to show this when @xmath13 is an open set of the form @xmath82 , for certain @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    to do this ,",
    "let us construct a sequence of triplets @xmath83 verifying the following conditions :    1 .",

    "3 .   @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 decreases monotonically to _",
    "zero _ while @xmath89 increases monotonically to @xmath90 .",
    "the existence of a sequence as above is clear and , thanks to the convergence criterion stated above , it follows that @xmath91 converges in the analytic topology to a certain @xmath92 .",
    "we claim that @xmath93 belongs to @xmath94 .",
    "indeed , chosen @xmath95 , the diffeomorphism @xmath96 belongs to @xmath97 for all @xmath98 .",
    "therefore the limit @xmath93 belongs to @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath95 was arbitrarily chosen , the statement follows at once .",
    "[ topologicalgroup ] note that @xmath2 endowed with the analytic topology is not a topological group .",
    "this happens because the mapping from @xmath2 to @xmath2 that associates to a chosen @xmath100 the element @xmath101 , where @xmath65 is fixed , is not continuous in general .",
    "in fact , a sequence @xmath102 converges in the analytic topology to @xmath59 if and only if @xmath103 where @xmath104 for every fixed @xmath105 and sufficiently large @xmath106 .",
    "however , if @xmath107 has a bounded domain of definition , this does not guarantee that @xmath108 admits a holomorphic extension to arbitrarily large discs .",
    "this remark was once communicated to the second author by l. lempert to whom we wish to thank .",

    "after @xcite , we are ensured of the existence of @xmath616 as above which , in fact , is a hyperbolic fixed point for some element @xmath617 .",
    "we shall construct points @xmath618 ( @xmath619 ) with similar properties and such that @xmath618 have disjoint orbits .",
    "the proof will then easily follow by an inductive argument .",
    "for this note that , according to the mentioned works and thanks to the contractive character of @xmath620 at @xmath616 , there exists a neighborhood @xmath531 of @xmath616 such that any holomorphic map @xmath621 from @xmath531 to @xmath622 can be approximated on compact sets of @xmath531 by actual elements @xmath623 , defined on @xmath531 and belonging to the pseudogroup generated by @xmath135 on @xmath13 .",

    "it remains only to show that the orbits of @xmath618 under the pseudogroup in question are disjoint .",

    "therefore @xmath454 is itself a power of @xmath625 ( on a neighborhood of @xmath628 ) by virtue of claim  2 .",
    "this is however impossible since @xmath629 and @xmath630 .",
    "the proofs of theorems  a and  b are now complete .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the problem of perturbing the generators of a subgroup of @xmath2 inside their conjugacy classes arises naturally in the study of germs of singular foliations at the origin of @xmath631 .",
    "probably the most typical example where this situation can be found corresponds to the class of nilpotent foliations of type @xmath30 .",
    "more precisely , these are local foliations @xmath632 defined by a ( germ of ) @xmath28-form @xmath633 having nilpotent linear part , i.e. @xmath634 , and a unique separatrix @xmath38 that happens to be a curve analytically equivalent to @xmath635 . in other words , there are local coordinates where @xmath38 is given by the equation @xmath636 . for this type of foliation the desingularization of the separatrix",
    " coincides \" with the reduction of the foliation itself . in other words ,",
    "the map associated to the desingularization of the separatrix @xmath637 reduces also the foliation @xmath632 .",
    "the exceptional divisor consists of a string of @xmath638 rational curves whose dual graph is        the vertices of this graph correspond to the irreducible components of the exceptional divisor @xmath639 .",
    "the weight of each irreducible component corresponds to its self - intersection . in turn",
    "the edges correspond to the intersection of two irreducible components and , finally , the arrow corresponds to the intersection point of the ( unique ) component @xmath640 of self - intersection  @xmath641 with the transform @xmath642 of @xmath38 .",
    "the component @xmath640 contains three singular points @xmath643 and @xmath644 where @xmath645 corresponds to the point determined by the intersection of @xmath640 with @xmath642 .",

    "note that the holonomy associated to the component @xmath647 , i.e. the holonomy map associated to the regular leaf @xmath649 of @xmath45 , coincides with the identity since this leaf is simply connected .",
    "it then follows that the germ of @xmath45 at @xmath646 admits a holomorphic first integral .",
    "since the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath650 we conclude that the local holonomy map @xmath241 associated to a small loop around @xmath646 _ and contained in @xmath640 _ has order equal to  @xmath651 .",

    "since @xmath654 is a regular leaf of @xmath45 , we conclude that the ( image of the ) holonomy representation of the fundamental group of @xmath654 in @xmath2 is nothing but the group generated by @xmath135 .",
    "note that this conclusion depends only on the configuration of the reduction tree . in turn",
    "this configuration depends only on a jet of finite order of @xmath633 .",
    "therefore every perturbation of the coefficients of @xmath633 affecting only those of sufficiently high order will give rise to perturbations of the above indicated generators preserving their fixed ( finite ) orders .",
    "since every local diffeomorphism of finite order is conjugate to the corresponding rotation , it follows that the mentioned perturbations are made inside the conjugacy classes of @xmath107 and @xmath241 .",
    "this also justifies the fact that in theorems  a and  b , only perturbations of local diffeomorphisms that do not alter the corresponding conjugation classes were considered .",
    "conversely given two local diffeomorphism @xmath655 of orders respectively @xmath656 , these diffeomorphism can be realized ( up to simultaneous conjugation ) as the holonomy of the corresponding component @xmath640 for some local foliation @xmath632 ( or @xmath45 ) .",
    "this is done through a well - known gluing procedure for which precise references will be provided later .",
    "therefore the set of all foliations @xmath632 , up to conjugation , can also be parameterized by the pair of elements @xmath657 an @xmath658 for some @xmath100 .      [ foliation ]",
