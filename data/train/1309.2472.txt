    "in high - energy processes parton distribution functions ( pdf ) and parton fragmentation functions ( pff ) are used to describe the link between hadrons in initial and final states , respectively , as well as the quark and gluons that are used to describe the processes within the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",

    "<S> transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , in short referred to as tmds , also take into account the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) of the partons . just as the @xmath0-integrated analogues we want to link them to quark and gluon matrix elements using operator product expansion methods in qcd , involving operators of definite twist . </S>",
    "<S> the tmds also involve operators of higher twist , which are not suppressed by powers of the hard scale , however . using the expression for tmds involving nonlocal matrix elements of quark and gluon fields </S>",
    "<S> there is a gauge link dependence , which also introduces an inherent process dependence . using transverse moments , which are specific @xmath0-weightings </S>",
    "<S> , we can establish the link with quark and gluon fields including the higher twist ones . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce ( a finite number of ) universal tmds of definite rank and show how the process dependent tmds can be written as combinations of these universal functions . </S>"
