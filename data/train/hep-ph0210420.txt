    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , the exclusive production of gluino pairs in @xmath2 annihilation is mediated by @xmath3-channel photons and @xmath1-bosons , which couple to the gluinos via triangular quark and squark loops . in this talk , we report about a recent study @xcite of the potential of high - energy linear @xmath2 colliders for the production of gluino pairs within the mssm .",
    "similar studies have been performed earlier for the production of sfermion pairs @xcite .",
    "taking into account realistic beam polarization effects , photon and @xmath1-boson exchange , and current mass exclusion limits , we scan the mssm parameter space for various @xmath2 center - of - mass energies to determine the regions , where gluino production should be visible . furthermore we clarify the theoretical questions of the relative sign between the two contributing triangular feynman diagrams , of the possible presence of an axial vector anomaly , and the conditions for vanishing cross sections  three related issues , which have so far been under debate in the literature .",
    "the scattering process e^-(p_1,_1 )  e^+(p_2,_2)(k_1 )  ( k_2 ) with incoming electron / positron momenta @xmath4 and helicities @xmath5 and outgoing gluino momenta @xmath6 proceeds through the two feynman diagrams a and b in fig .",
    "[ klafig:1 ] with @xmath3-channel photon and @xmath1-boson exchange and triangular quark and squark loops .",
    "higgs boson exchange is not considered due to the negligibly small electron yukawa coupling , but it could well be relevant at muon colliders .",
    "the process occurs only at the one - loop level , since the gluino as the superpartner of the gauge boson of the strong interaction couples neither directly to leptons nor to electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "our analytical results are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in full detail .",
    "taking into account chiral squark mixing , we find that pairs of identical ( majorana ) gluinos are produced by a parity violating axial vector coupling induced by mass differences between the chiral squarks and the axial vector coupling of the @xmath1-boson . the ( mass - independent ) ultraviolet singularities contained in the loop integrals cancel among the two contributing feynman diagrams . as we have checked explicitly ( even for complex squark mixing matrices ) , adding the two amplitudes induces not only a cancellation of the ultraviolet singularities and of the logarithmic dependence on the scale parameter , but also a destructive interference of the finite remainders .",
    "this happens separately for each weak isospin partner .",
    "our analytical results have been obtained in two independent analytical calculations and have been implemented in a compact fortran computer code . as a third independent cross - check , we have recalculated the production of gluino pairs in @xmath2 annihilation with the computer algebra program feynarts / formcalc @xcite and found numerical agreement up to 15 digits .",
    "our calculations involve various masses and couplings of sm particles , for which we use the most up - to - date values from the 2002 review of the particle data group @xcite .",
    "in particular , we evaluate the electromagnetic fine structure constant @xmath7 at the mass of the @xmath1-boson , @xmath8 gev , and calculate the weak mixing angle @xmath9 from the tree - level expression @xmath10 with @xmath11 gev . among the fermion masses ,",
    "only the one of the top quark , @xmath12 gev , plays a significant role due to its large splitting from the bottom quark mass , @xmath13 gev , while the latter and the charm quark mass , @xmath14 gev , could have been neglected like those of the three light quarks and of the electron / positron .",
    "the strong coupling constant is evaluated at the gluino mass scale from the one - loop expression with five active flavors and @xmath15 mev , corresponding to @xmath16 .",
    "a variation of the renormalization scale by a factor of four about the gluino mass results in a cross section uncertainty of about @xmath17 % . like the heavy top quark ,",
    "all susy particles have been decoupled from the running of the strong coupling constant .",
    "we work in the framework of the mssm with conserved @xmath18- ( matter- ) parity , which represents the simplest phenomenologically viable model , but which is still sufficiently general to not depend on a specific susy breaking mechanism .",
    "models with broken @xmath18-parity are severely restricted by the non - observation of proton decay , which would violate both baryon and lepton number conservation .",
    "we do not consider light gluino mass windows , on which the literature has focused so far and which may or may not be excluded from searches at fixed target and collider experiments @xcite .",
    "instead , we adopt the current mass limit @xmath19 gev from the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite searches in the jets with missing energy channel , relevant for non - mixing squark masses of @xmath20 gev and @xmath21 .",
    "values for the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath22 , below 2.4 are already excluded by the cern lep experiments , although this value is obtained using one - loop corrections only and depends in addition on the top quark mass @xcite . in order to delimit the regions of large gluino cross sections",
    ", we have scanned the mssm parameter space over @xmath23 $ ] , the higgs mass parameter @xmath24 $ ] tev , the trilinear coupling @xmath25 $ ] tev , and the squark mass parameter @xmath26 $ ] gev .",
    "we found that the cross section is visible only for parameter choices resulting in large squark mass splittings , specified below , and that its sensitivity to individual parameter choices is small .",
    "if not stated otherwise , we will present unpolarized cross sections for a @xmath27 gev linear @xmath2 collider like desy tesla , gluino masses of @xmath28 gev , and",
    "squark masses @xmath29",
    "gev . we will consider two cases of large squark mass splittings : i. ) on the one hand , the masses of the superpartners of left- and right - handed quarks need not be equal to each other . in this scenario",
    "we will vary the right - handed up - type squark mass parameters @xmath30 between 200 and 1500 gev .",
    "ii . ) on the other hand , the superpartners of the heavy quarks can mix into light and heavy mass eigenstates .",
    "this alternative is restricted by the cern lep limits on the light top and bottom squark masses , @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 gev @xcite , and on susy one - loop contributions @xcite to the @xmath33-parameter , @xmath34 @xcite . in this case",
    "we assume the maximally allowed top squark mixing with @xmath35 , @xmath36 gev , and @xmath37 gev , which can be generated by choosing appropriate values for the higgs mass parameter , @xmath38 gev , and the trilinear top squark coupling , @xmath39 gev . for small values of @xmath22",
    ", mixing in the bottom squark sector remains small , and we take @xmath40 .",
    "although the absolute magnitude of the cross section depends strongly on the gluino mass and collider energy , the relative importance of the different contributions is very similar also for higher gluino masses and collider energies .",
    "first we examine the conditions found in ref .",
    "@xcite for vanishing of the photon and @xmath1-boson contributions , restricting ourselves to the third generation .",
    "since we expect the photon contribution to cancel for equal left- and right - handed squark masses , we vary the right - handed top squark mass parameter , @xmath41 , between 200 and 1500 gev , but keep @xmath42 gev fixed ( case",
    "i ) , since top and bottom squarks generally interfere destructively due to their opposite charge and weak isospin quantum numbers . as can be seen from fig.[klafig:4 ] , the photon contribution cancels indeed for @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. _ for all flavors @xmath44 with equal squark masses . due to their charge , top ( s)quarks contribute four times as much as bottom ( s)quarks , whose contribution is even more suppressed by the condition @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath1-boson contribution can never cancel , since @xmath46 , and therefore it depends only weakly on @xmath47 , but it can become minimal for @xmath48 . as @xmath47 gets significantly larger ( or smaller ) than @xmath49 , the photon contribution starts to dominate over the @xmath1-boson contribution .",
    "if only @xmath47 differs from @xmath49 , the third generation contributes almost 100% to the total cross section .",
    "however , if @xmath50 are varied simultaneously , all three generations contribute to the total cross section , which can therefore become significantly larger .    when @xmath51 and large mass splittings are generated only by mixing in the top squark sector ( case ii ) , photon contributions are suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "[ klafig:6 ] shows that the    @xmath1-boson contributions from top and bottom squarks interfere destructively due to opposite values of their weak isospin quantum numbers , except for @xmath52 , where the imaginary parts of the amplitudes interfere constructively .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to keep the bottom squark mass splitting small . as is also evident from fig .",
    "[ klafig:6 ] , mixing in the bottom squark sector is of little importance .",
    "note that the central region with maximal top / bottom squark mixing is excluded by the cern lep limits on @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and the @xmath33-parameter .",
    "when @xmath49 and the diagonal elements of the squark mixing matrix become much larger than the quark masses and the off - diagonal elements of the matrix , the role of squark mixing is reduced , as expected .",
    "squarks from the first two generations contribute at most 10% at low @xmath49 and are otherwise strongly suppressed .    at future linear @xmath2 colliders",
    "it will be possible to obtain relatively high degrees of polarization , _ i.e. _ about 80% for electrons and",
    "60% for positrons .",
    "for these degrees of polarization , we show in fig .",
    "[ klafig:9 ] a scan in the center - of - mass energy of a future @xmath2    collider for various gluino masses and maximal top squark mixing ( case ii ) .",
    "the cross section rises rather slowly due to the factor @xmath55 for @xmath56-wave production of the gluino pairs . for @xmath28 gev",
    "we observe an interesting second maximum , which arises from the intermediate squark pair resonance at @xmath57 gev . at threshold ,",
    "the cross section depends strongly on the gluino mass and is largest for @xmath58 gev , which we consider to be the lowest experimentally allowed value .",
    "it drops fast with @xmath59 , so that for @xmath60 gev no events at colliders with luminosities of 1000 fb@xmath61 per year can be expected , irrespective of their energy .",
    "smaller squark mixing ( cf .",
    "[ klafig:6 ] ) or larger values of @xmath49 will reduce the cross section even further . far above threshold , it drops off like @xmath62 and becomes independent of the gluino mass .",
    "the slow rise of the cross section can be observed even better in fig.[klafig:11 ] , where the sensitivity of a @xmath27 gev collider like    desy tesla to gluino masses around 200 gev has been plotted . for the cern lhc experiments ,",
    "a precision of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) gev is expected for gluino masses of 540 ( 1004 ) gev .",
    "if the masses and mixing angle(s ) of the top ( and bottom ) squarks are known , a precision of @xmath65 gev can be achieved at desy tesla for @xmath28 gev and maximal top squark mixing with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath61 per center - of - mass energy point .    as has already been mentioned above",
    ", the majorana nature of the gluino leads to a vanishing forward - backward asymmetry . in order to establish this feature experimentally ,",
    "the asymmetry has to be measured with an accuracy of at least 710% , which are the values relevant for dirac fermions such as up- ( charm ) and down - type ( strange / bottom ) quarks @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the production cross section must be known with about the same precision . in view of the results obtained in fig .",
    "[ klafig:11 ] , such a measurement appears to be extremely difficult if not impossible .",
    "in this talk , we have reported on a recent study of gluino pair production at future @xmath2 colliders @xcite . in this study , we have resolved a long - standing discrepancy in the literature about the relative sign of the quark and squark loop contributions to the production of gluino pairs in @xmath2 annihilation .",
    "we have found that the ultraviolet divergence cancels for each squark flavor separately and not between weak isospin partners .",
    "our results rely on two completely independent analytical calculations and one computer algebra calculation .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated the prospects for precision measurements of gluino properties , such as its mass or its majorana fermion nature , at future linear @xmath2 colliders .",
    "we have taken into account realistic beam polarization effects , photon and @xmath1-boson exchange , and current mass exclusion limits .",
    "previously , only light gluinos at center - of - mass energies up to the @xmath1-boson mass had been investigated . within the general framework of the mssm ,",
    "we have concentrated on two scenarios of large left-/right - handed up - type squark mass splitting and large top squark mixing , which produce promisingly large cross sections for gluino masses up to 500 gev or even 1 tev .",
    "gluino masses of 200 gev can then be measured with a precision of about 5 gev in center - of - mass energy scans with luminosities of 100 fb@xmath61/point . however , when both the left-/right - handed squark mass splitting and the squark mixing remain small , gluino pair production in @xmath2 annihilation will be hard to observe , even with luminosities of 1000 fb@xmath61/year .",
