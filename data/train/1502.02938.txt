    "within the quantum world , the question what quantities can be measured in an experiment is often a non - trivial one , e.g. , measuring time correlators ( with times @xmath0 ) requires finding the correct ordering of operators .",
    "concrete examples in mesoscopic physics and quantum optics are the measurements of charge correlators @xcite or full counting statistics @xcite and that of photon correlators @xcite . the question is usually resolved by including the measurement apparatus in the description and its internal workings decide upon the form of the measured correlator .",
    "examples are the ampremeter , double - dot detector , and spin counter used in refs . , , and , or the different photodetectors introduced by glauber and by mandel @xcite .",
    "these detectors then act back on the system , thereby influencing the measurement outcome , i.e. , the specific form of the correlator .",
    "e.g. , a weak measurement as used in ref .  , see also ref .  , leads to symmetrized ( @xmath1 ) and antisymmetrized ( @xmath2 ) correlators weighted with different detector response functions @xcite , while a strong measurement produces a projected correlator @xmath3 .",
    "these different forms of measured correlators can be derived @xcite by invoking the von neumann projection postulate @xcite , telling how to restart the system after the first measurement at @xmath4 ( or after previous measurements at times @xmath5 in a @xmath6-th order correlator ) .",
    "the measurement with a weakly coupled detector can be treated perturbatively , with the von neumann projection excerted on the detector and no back action on the system @xcite . in a strong measurement with a large system  detector coupling",
    ", the projection formally can be applied directly to the system , therefore producing a maximal back action @xcite .",
    "schematic illustration of different measurement procedures for a two - time ( @xmath4 , @xmath7 ) correlator : ( a ) strong measurement described by von neumann projection acting directly on the system at time @xmath4 and providing a projected correlator @xmath8 after readout at @xmath9 ; for a weak measurement , the von neumann projection at time @xmath4 acts on the weakly coupled detector .",

    "we replace the von neumann projection by entangling the measured system with co - evolving quantum memories , see fig.[fig : comp ] , thereby ( effectively ) expanding the hilbert space of the total system in every measurement step .",
    "the desired correlator then is derived from a final measurement of all the quantum memories by invoking born s rule @xcite .",
    "hence the entire system plus memories undergoes a unitary quantum evolution until the very end , where the born rule takes us from the quantum to the classical world .",
    "the new scheme captures the cases of weak and strong measurement within a unique formalism by merely changing the degree of entanglement between the system and the quantum memory . in the limits of weak and strong entanglement",
    ", we reproduce the results previously derived via use of the projection postulate .",
    "no simple physical form for the time - correlators could be found so far in the intermediate coupling regime .    describing a measurement by entangling the system with a detector and including a ( dissipative ) bath in the evolution of the density matrix is a concept that has been well developed over the past two decades @xcite . here",
    ", we extend the idea of system  detector entanglement to the case of repeated measurement . thereby , the quantum memories evolve coherently during and after the information transfer from the system due to entanglement , with the ( dissipative ) measurement deferred to the very end of the process .",
    "the proposed scheme for the measurement of time - correlated observables finds an interesting application in mesoscopic physics .",
    "in particular , measuring the charge @xmath10 dynamics of a quantum dot with the help of a nearby quantum point contact is a classic problem by now@xcite . in such a setup , single electron pulses",
    "@xcite assume the role of flying qubit memories which are either transmitted or reflected by the quantum point contact ( qpc ) , depending on the dot s charge state , see fig.[fig : meso_setup ] .",

    ", we propose a setup , see fig .",

    "we start with a system state at the initial time @xmath13 @xmath14 and a quantum memory in the initial state @xmath15 and have them transiently interact at time @xmath4 with the help of an externally controlled interaction ( to be identified with a quantum detector ) .",

    "making use of born s rule , we find the probability distribution function @xmath28 for the measurement outcomes @xmath29 and @xmath30 on the two memory observables ; this probability distribution contains the desired information on the system s two - time correlator .",
    "the specific relation between the distribution function @xmath28 of measurement outcomes and the correlator of system observables @xmath31 and @xmath32 depends on the system  detector coupling and the observables measured on the memories ; we will show below how to extract the well known ( anti-)symmetrized and projected correlators from the probabilities @xmath28 in the limits of weak and strong measurements .    in the end , by making use of quantum memories which store the information acquired from the system at the quantum level at earlier times @xmath4 and @xmath9 until the final time @xmath33",
