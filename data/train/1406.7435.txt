    "are fundamental mathematical objects and the topic of _ codes in permutations _ is a well - studied subject in coding theory . a variety of applications that correspond to different metric functions on the symmetric group on @xmath1 elements @xmath2 have been investigated .",
    "for example , some works focus on error - correcting codes in @xmath2 with hamming distance  @xcite , and some others investigate the error correction problem under metrics such as chebyshev distance  @xcite and kendall tau distance  @xcite .",
    "while error correction problems in permutation spaces have been investigated before , the lossy compression problem is largely left unattended . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigate the lossless compression of a group of permutations with certain properties , such as efficient rank querying ( given an element , get its rank in the permutation ) and selection ( given a rank , retrieve the corresponding element ) .",
    "by contrast , in this paper we consider the lossy compression ( source coding ) of permutations , which is motivated by the problems of storing ranking data , and lower bounding the complexity of approximate sorting , which we now describe .    *",
    "storing ranking data : * in applications such as recommendation systems , users rank products and these rankings are analyzed to provide new recommendations .",
    "to have personalized recommendation , it may be necessary to store the ranking data for each user in the system , and hence the storage efficiency of ranking data is of interest . because a ranking of @xmath1 items can be represented as a permutation of 1 to @xmath1 , storing a ranking is equivalent to storing a permutation .",
    "furthermore , in many cases a rough knowledge of the ranking ( e.g. , finding one of the top five elements instead of the top element ) is sufficient .",
    "this poses the question of the number of bits needed for permutation storage when a certain amount of error can be tolerated . in many current applications",
    "the cost of lossless storage is usually tolerable and hence lossy compression may not be necessary .",
    "however lossy compression is a fundamental topic and it is of theoretical interest to understand the trade - off involved .    * lower bounding the complexity of approximate sorting : * given a group of elements of distinct values , comparison - based sorting can be viewed as the process of searching for a true ranking by pairwise comparisons .",
    "since each comparison in sorting provides at most 1 bit of information , the log - size of the permutation set @xmath2 , @xmath3 , provides a lower bound to the required number of comparisons .",
    "similarly , the lossy source coding of permutations provides a lower bound on the number of comparisons to the problem of comparison - based approximate sorting , which can be seen as finding a true permutation up to a certain distortion .",
    "again , the log - size of the code indicates the amount of information ( in bits ) needed to specify the true permutation , which in turn provides a lower bound on the number of pairwise comparisons needed .    in one line of work , authors of @xcite derived both lower and upper bounds for approximate sorting in some range of allowed distortion with respect to the spearman s footrule metric  @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "another line of work concerns an important class of approximate sorting , the problem of _ partial sorting _ ,",
    "first proposed in @xcite ( cf .",
    "* chapter 8) for an exposition on the relationships between various sorting problems ) .",
    "given a set of @xmath1 elements @xmath4 and a set of indices @xmath5 , a partial sorting algorithm aims to arrange the elements into a list @xmath6 $ ] such that for any @xmath7 , all elements with indices @xmath8 are no greater than @xmath9 , and all elements with indices @xmath10 are no smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "a partial sorting algorithm essentially selects all elements with ranks in the set @xmath11 , and hence is also called _",
    "multiple selection_. the information - theoretic lower bound for partial sorting algorithms have been proposed in  @xcite , and the authors of  @xcite propose a multiple selection algorithms with expected number of comparisons within the information - theoretic lower - bound and an asymptotically negligible additional term .",
    "comparing with existing work ( such as @xcite ) , our analysis framework via rate - distortion theory is more general as we provide an information - theoretic lower bound on the query complexity for _ all _ approximate sorting algorithms that achieve a certain distortion , and the multiple selection algorithm proposed in  @xcite turns out to be optimal for the general approximate sorting problem as well .",
    "therefore , our information - theoretic lower bound is tight .",
    "it is worth noting that every comparison - based sorting algorithm corresponds to a compression scheme of the permutation space . in particular",
    ", the string of bits that represent comparison outcomes in any deterministic ( approximate ) sorting algorithm corresponds to a ( lossy ) representation of the permutation .    for a more in - depth discussion on the relationship between sorting and compression ,",
    "see  @xcite and references therein .    beyond the above applications , the rate - distortion theory in permutation spaces is of technical interest on its own because the permutation space does not possess the product structure that a discrete memoryless source induces .    with the above motivations , we consider the problem of lossy compression in permutation spaces in this paper . following the classical rate - distortion formulation ,",
    "we aim to determine , given a distortion measure @xmath12 , the minimum number of bits needed to describe a permutation with distortion at most @xmath13 .",
    "the analysis of the lossy compression problem depends on the source distribution and the distortion measure .",
    "we are mainly concerned with the permutation spaces with a uniform distribution , and consider different distortion measures based on four distances in the permutation spaces : the kendall tau distance , spearman s footrule , chebyshev distance and inversion-@xmath0 distance . as we shall see in , each of these distortion measures ( except inversion-@xmath0 distance distance  due to its extremal property shown in equation , which is useful when we derive results for other permutation spaces .",
    "further use of this metric in the context of smooth representation of permutations can be found in  @xcite . ] ) has its own operational meaning that may be useful in different applications .",
    "in addition to characterizing the trade - off between rate and distortion , we also show that under the uniform distribution over the permutation space , there are close relationships between some of the distortion measures of interest in this paper .",
    "we use these relations to establish the corresponding equivalence of source codes in permutation spaces with different distortion measures . for each distortion measure",
    ", we provide simple and constructive achievability schemes , leading to explicit code designs with low complexity .",
    "finally , we turn our attention to non - uniform distributions over the permutation space . in some applications",
    ", we may have prior knowledge about the permutation data , which can be captured in a model of non - uniform distribution .",
    "there are a variety of distributional models in different contexts , such as the bradley - terry model  @xcite , the luce - plackett model  @xcite , and the mallows model  @xcite . among these",
    ", we choose the mallows model due to its richness and applicability in various ranking applications  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the lossless and lossy compression of the permutation space under the mallows model and with the kendall tau distance as the distortion measure , and characterize its entropy and end points of its rate - distortion function .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the problem formulation in .",
    "we then analyze the geometry of the permutation spaces and show that there exist close relationships between some distortion measures of interest in this paper in . in",
    ", we derive the rate - distortion functions for different permutation spaces . in , we provide achievability schemes for different permutation spaces under different regimes .",
    "after that , we turn our attention to non - uniform distributional model over the permutation space and analyze the lossless and lossy compression for mallows model in .",
    "we conclude with a few remarks in .",
    "in this section we discuss aspects of the formulation of the rate - distortion problem for permutation spaces .",

    "<S> we investigate lossy compression ( source coding ) of data in the form of permutations . </S>",
    "<S> this problem has direct applications in the storage of ordinal data or rankings , and in the analysis of sorting algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the rate - distortion characteristic for the permutation space under the uniform distribution , and the minimum achievable rate of compression that allows a bounded distortion after recovery . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is with respect to different practical and useful distortion measures , including kendall tau distance , spearman s footrule , chebyshev distance and inversion-@xmath0 distance . </S>",
    "<S> we establish equivalence of source code designs under certain distortions and show simple explicit code designs that incur low encoding / decoding complexities and are asymptotically optimal . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that for the mallows model , a popular nonuniform ranking model on the permutation space , both the entropy and the maximum distortion at zero rate are much lower than the uniform counterparts , which motivates the future design of efficient compression schemes for this model .    </S>",
