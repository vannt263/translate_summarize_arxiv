    "the celebrated gauss - lucas theorem claims that for any univariate polynomial @xmath1 with complex coefficients , all roots of @xmath2 belong to the convex hull of the roots of @xmath1 , see theorem 6.1 of @xcite .",
    "many generalizations have been obtained over the years see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .    in the present note , motivated by problems in potential theory in @xmath3",
    "we extend the gauss - lucas theorem to sequences of polynomials of increasing degrees whose almost all zeros lie in a given convex bounded domain in @xmath0 .",

    "if @xmath17 is the @xmath18-th chebyshev polynomial of the first kind , then the derivative of @xmath19 has all its zeros in the upper half plane .",
    "therefore , if we replace @xmath20 by @xmath21 for some sufficiently small @xmath22 ( i.e. , shift all zeros downward by @xmath22 ) , then we obtain polynomials of degrees @xmath23 with @xmath18 zeros in @xmath15 , but whose derivatives have no zeros in @xmath15 .",
    "choosing @xmath22 appropriately for each @xmath18 , we get a sequence of polynomials with all but one zeros in @xmath15 whose derivatives have no zeros in @xmath15 .",
    "strict convexity ( e.g. , as in the case of the open unit disk ) will not be of much help either .",
    "just replace above @xmath20 by @xmath24 with some large @xmath25 and then make a vertical translation so that after all these operations the image of @xmath26 $ ] becomes a tiny secant segment of the unit circle .",

    "both these facts are readily available for an arbitrary bounded convex domain . finally , the hardy spaces of analytic functions in the disk are replaced by the smirnov classes @xmath89 of functions representable by cauchy integrals with @xmath90-densities ( with respect to arclength ) . in the domains with piecewise smooth boundaries , e.g. , convex domains ,",
