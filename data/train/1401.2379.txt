    "several attempts have been published to express the brunt - visl frequency ( hereafter bvf ) in terms of the two conservative variables represented by the total water specific content ( i.e. for closed systems ) and the specific moist entropy ( i.e. for closed , reversible and adiabatic systems ) .",
    "the methods described in durran and klemp ( 1982 ) and emanuel ( 1994 )  hereafter referred to as dk82 and e94 , respectively  mainly differ by the choice of the `` moist entropy '' formulation to be used as a moist conservative variable .",
    "the entropy potential temperature @xmath1 recently defined in marquet ( 2011 , hereafter referred to as m11 ) corresponds to a general formulation for the specific moist entropy , valid for any parcel of moist atmosphere with varying specific content of dry air , water vapour and liquid or solid water .",
    "the aim of this article is therefore to derive non - saturated and saturated versions of the squared bvf expressed in terms of @xmath1 , and to compare them comprehensively with the previous moist formulations published in dk82 and e94 . in this respect ,",
    "the objective of the article is more general than that targeted in geleyn and marquet ( 2010 ) , where the objective was to express the squared bvf in terms of an approximate formulation for @xmath1 , namely @xmath2 .",
    "comparisons between the exact and the approximate versions of the specific moist entropy defined in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be realized with the help of the conservative variable diagrams published in pauluis ( 2008 , 2011 , hereafter referred to as p08 and p11 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the mathematical definition of the moist squared bvf ( @xmath3 ) is presented in section  2 , with @xmath3 expressed in terms of the gradients of the two conservative variables ( @xmath4 ) and established in the appendix  b. the moist definition of the state equation is recalled in the section  3 , together with m11 s specific moist entropy defined in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "the non - saturated and saturated versions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are then presented in sections  4 and 5 , with some detailed computations available in the appendices  c and d , respectively .",
    "several comparisons between @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the previous versions published in dk82 and e94 are presented in the section  6 .",
    "the comparisons are made either with the formulation expressed in terms of the lapse rate formulation or in terms of the gradients of the two conservative variables ( @xmath4 ) , with a special attention paid to the latter one in the section  7 .",
    "the non - saturated and saturated approximate versions of the moist squared bvf expressed with @xmath2 are presented in the section  8 .",
    "some numerical applications are presented in the section  9 with the use of the same fire - i data sets than in m11 .",
    "separate analyses are made for in - cloud ( saturated ) and clear - air ( non - saturated ) air .",
    "additional analyses are presented in the appendix  e and f. first , the non - saturated moist squared bvf is compared with the usual formula expressed in terms of the vertical gradient of the virtual potential temperature .",
    "second , the possibility of defining an analytic transition between the non - saturated and the saturated versions of the moist squared bvf is explored , using a control parameter @xmath7 varying continuously between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section 10 .",
    "it is shown in appendix  b that the moist squared bvf can be defined by @xmath10 formulation ( [ def_new_n2_moist_6 ] ) is different from the classical one used in dk82 or e94 , for instance .",
    "it is assumed that the density can be expressed as a function of the two conserved variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as well as of pressure @xmath13 , leading to @xmath14 .",
    "the moist squared bvf can then be expressed as a weighting sum of the two local vertical gradients of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with weighting factors depending on appropriate partial derivatives of the density with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in order to compute the moist formulation ( [ def_new_n2_moist_6 ] ) ,",
    "the density must be expressed analytically in terms of the three independent variables @xmath15 .",
    "one of the problems is that such an explicit formulation for @xmath16 does not exist for the moist air .",
    "it is however possible to define @xmath17 in terms of @xmath15 by expressing the entropy and the state equations as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and then by eliminating the temperature .",
    "this method is used in the sections [ sec_n2m_unsat ] and [ sec_n2m_sat ] and in appendices c and d to compute the non - saturated and saturated version of the squared bvf .",
    "the saturated case is more difficult to deal with than the non - saturated one , because of the existing condensed water terms @xmath20 or @xmath21 . but",
    "these terms can be expressed as differences between @xmath12 and the saturated values @xmath22 or @xmath23 , which depend on @xmath24 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is thus necessary to express the temperature @xmath24 in terms of @xmath15 , at least implicitly .",
    "the state equation of the moist air is written with the use of the dry gas constant @xmath25 replacing the moist value @xmath26 , yielding @xmath27 where the virtual temperature @xmath28 ( lilly , 1968 ) is equal to @xmath29 from the appendix  a , the constants are equal to @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",

    "this term is a consequence of the moist entropy being defined `` per unit mass of dry air '' in dk82 and e94 , corresponding to the transformation of any specific value @xmath145 into @xmath146 .",
    "it is important to notice that , even if the moist lapse rates are multiplied by @xmath95 , this has no impact on @xmath147 and @xmath148 , since the lapse rates are divided by the same factor in ( [ def_bvf_sat_dk82_bis ] ) and ( [ def_bvf_sat_em94_bis ] ) .",
    "the adiabatic lapse rates of a parcel in a moist atmosphere should however get a unique definition , and the specific moist entropy based on @xmath1 and ( [ def_ths ] ) appears to be a more general way to obtain it , leading to the simple shape of @xmath74 given by ( [ def_bvf_g_sw])-([def_sat_d2l ] ) .",
    "second , it seems that one of the constraints for determining or choosing the moist entropy formulations @xmath149 or @xmath150 may be to express the squared bvf as a sum of two terms only , with a first term depending only on the gradient of moist entropy formulations plus another term depending only on the gradient of @xmath12 , but being exactly equal to the prescribed value @xmath151 given by ( [ def_bvf_sat_new_last2 ] ) .",

    "[ fig_ps10_diagrams ] _ ]    the specific moist entropy has a unique formulation since it is a thermodynamic state function . in this respect , different moist entropy formulations must lead to different sets of curves in the conservative variable diagram plotted in figure  [ fig_ps10_diagrams ] .",
    "the solid lines and the dashed lines coincide for the dry air limit at the bottom of the diagram , due to the global shift by the amount of the dry air standard value @xmath162 for @xmath11 .",
    "the differences between lines of equal value of @xmath24 become more and more important as @xmath12 increases .",
    "the saturation curves are also different , depending of the use of @xmath156 versus @xmath154 formulations . the dashed lines are almost equal values of @xmath118 in the saturated region , whereas the specific moist entropy @xmath11 decreases as @xmath12 increases in the saturated region .",
    "these differences demonstrate that the way in which the moist entropy is defined may generate important differences in the physical interpretation .",
    "in fact , it is unlikely that some arbitrariness may exist in the possibility to change the formulation of the specific moist entropy .",
    "it is the difference in the formulations of the moist entropy that generates the large impacts on the definition of the moist squared bvf and concerning the different ways to write the terms depending on the gradient of @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , even if the squared bvf values eventually remain close to each other , different values for the changes in moist entropy correspond to different physical meanings .",
    "in particular , for isothermal and isobaric transformations where @xmath12 increases by the same given amount of @xmath161  g  kg@xmath159 , the black circles and stars represent the changes in moist entropies associated with isothermal and isobaric transformations .",
    "the changes in moist entropies are clearly different in pa10 s version from the present one . in saturated conditions ,",
    "the change of entropy almost cancels out with @xmath154 , whereas the specific moist entropy exhibits a large decrease with @xmath156 .",
    "it may be considered that the almost isentropic feature appearing for the isotherms above the saturation curve with the formulations of pa10 and e94 is a very special case that is not explained by the theory , nor supported by observations .",
    "the reference values are determined in @xmath156 from the third law and @xmath163 in ( [ def_ths ] ) is replaced by @xmath164 in ( [ def_sat_ths_star_em94 ] ) .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that when @xmath48 is arbitrarily set to @xmath165 in the @xmath1 definition ( [ def_ths ] ) , the solid lines are almost superimposed on the dashed lines in figure  [ fig_ps10_diagrams ] ( result not shown ) .",
    "this indicates that the third law used to compute the special value of @xmath48 is a key part for the definition of @xmath156 , and that the logic of pa10 and e94 is of a different kind .",
    "it is therefore important to justify the present formulation , with the above prescribed term separated from the other terms in the second line of ( [ def_bvf_ns_new ] ) and ( [ def_bvf_sat_new_l ] ) even if those also depend on the gradient of @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , this prescribed term was introduced first in le74 as a correction to older formulations , in the form @xmath166 given by ( [ def_bvf_sat_new_last3 ] ) .",
    "this correction term also appears in the dk82 s moist version in the equivalent form ( [ def_bvf_sat_new_last2 ] ) , where it was still considered as an additional term .    by analogy with the ideas published in pauluis and held ( 2002 )",
    ", this correction term may be interpreted as a modification to the vertical stability , represented here by @xmath6 , and corresponding to a conversion between the kinetic and the potential energy due to the work required to ensure the vertical transport of water species .",
    "hence , the correction term given by ( [ def_bvf_sat_new_last2 ] ) logically appears in the dk82 and e94 conservative variable formulations ( [ def_bvf_sat_dk82_bis ] ) and ( [ def_bvf_sat_em94_bis ] ) and also in the first lines of the present formulations ( [ def_bvf_ns_new ] ) and ( [ def_bvf_sat_new_l ] ) for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , but given by the equivalent form ( [ def_bvf_sat_new_last3 ] ) . the correction term must not be included in the specific moist entropy term , nor be regrouped with the second line of ( [ def_bvf_ns_new ] ) and ( [ def_bvf_sat_new_l ] ) .",
    "the computation of the moist squared bvfs in terms of the vertical gradient of @xmath167 are derived in the appendix  e , showing that the moist squared bvf based on the specific moist entropy @xmath156 is not exactly proportional to @xmath168 for a moist but non - saturated atmosphere .",
    "an interesting feature suggested by the second lines of ( [ def_bvf_ns_new ] ) and ( [ def_bvf_sat_new_l ] ) , in which the moist squared bvf is based on the @xmath1 approach , is that a continuous transition may exist between the two unsaturated and saturated regimes .",
    "an example of this kind of transition is described in the appendix  f.    summing up , the important new result derived in the present paper is that the specific moist entropy ( and @xmath1 ) really verify the conservative property associated with the second principle .",
    "the consequence is that second lines must exist in both the non - saturated version ( [ def_bvf_ns_new ] ) and the saturated one ( [ def_bvf_sat_new_l ] ) .",
    "the physical meaning for these extra terms can be found in the results obtained in m11 , where the vertical profile for the specific moist entropy @xmath11 is observed to be almost a constant for marine stratocumulus , in spite of existing vertical trends for the b73 variables @xmath12 and @xmath57 .",

    "first , in the already mentioned case of fire - i marine stratocumulus clouds , there is hardly any gradient of specific moist entropy between clear - air and cloudy patches in figure  [ fig_rf03b_n2_results ]  ( a ) , and most of the so - called subgrid transport of @xmath12 is ensured by turbulent motions and not by partly organized compensating motions between these patches .",
    "viewing here @xmath7 as a kind of subgrid cloud cover becomes rather legitimate , if one indeed attributes the nonlinear part of the @xmath206 or @xmath207 behaviour to the existence of the above - mentioned ( small ) partly organized transport .",
    "second , the fact that one single parameter is sufficient to obtain a monotonic , general and consistent transition between unsaturated and saturated situations is a welcome step for applications seeking a robust and simple behaviour .    in summary , the proposed transition formulas need to be used with a lot of care ( especially for the estimation of @xmath7 ) : there is at least one case where they should be directly appropriate , while in other cases they may be useful because of their simplicity ( one control parameter alone ) and of their monotonic character , for lack of other alternatives in front of practical problems .",

    "second , it is no longer possible to find an equivalent of ( [ def_new_n2_moist_6 ] ) leading to ( [ def_bvf_fc_mc ] ) , since the simplifications allowing us to express @xmath24 as a function of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( as used in appendices  c and d ) have no equivalent in the case of a grid - mesh partly saturated and partly unsaturated .    nevertheless , @xmath206 has the physical dimension of a squared bvf , and its expression closely follows , term by term , the physical logic explained in the sections  6 and 7 .",

    "it is expected that the unstable ( stable ) feature of isentropic motions of moist air , which is in correspondence with saturated ( unsaturated ) condition , must also have a neutral case in between . even if the definition of a transition parameter remains a complex issue , well beyond the scope of the present work , @xmath206 offers a monotonic path leading to some `` moist neutrality '' for a value of @xmath7 within the interval @xmath460 $ ] .",
