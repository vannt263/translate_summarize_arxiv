    "as recent cosmological simulations imply , the temperature of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) undergoes a significant change from high to low redshifts parallel to the proceeding of large - scale structure formation in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", a substantial fraction of the baryonic matter in the local universe is expected to reside in the so - called warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "the whim represents a low - density ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) , high - temperature ( @xmath2 k ) plasma that primarily is made of protons , electrons , he , and he , together with traces of some highly - ionised heavy elements .",
    "the whim is believed to emerge from intergalactic gas that is shock - heated to high temperatures as the medium is collapsing under the action of gravity in large - scale filaments ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "part of the warm ( photoionised ) intergalactic medium that gives rise to the ly@xmath3 forest in the spectra of distant quasars ( qso ) is falling in to the potential wells of the increasingly pronounced filaments , gains energy ( through gravity ) , and is heated to high temperatures by shocks that run through the plasma .    because of the low density and the high degree of ionisation , direct observations of the shock - heated and collisionally ionised whim are challenging with current instrumentation ( in contrast to the photoionised igm , which is easily observable through the ly@xmath3 forest ) .",
    "diffuse emission from the whim plasma must have a very low surface brightness and its detection awaits uv and x - ray observatories more sensitive than currently available ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . the most promising approach to study",
    "the whim with observations at low redshift is to search for absorption features from the whim in fuv and in the x - ray regime in the spectra of quasars , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and other suited extragalactic background sources .",
    "as the whim represents a highly - ionised plasma , the most important whim absorption lines are those originating from the electronic transitions of high - ionisation state ions ( hereafter referred to as `` high ions '' ) of abundant heavy elements such as oxygen and carbon . among these",
    ", five - times ionised oxygen ( o ) is the most valuable high ion to trace the whim at temperatures of @xmath4 k in the fuv regime . in the x - ray band ,",
    "the o and o transitions represent the key observables to trace the whim at higher temperatures in the range @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to the spectral signatures of high ions of heavy elements the search for broad and shallow ly@xmath3 absorption from the tiny fraction of neutral hydrogen in the whim represents another possibility to identify and study the most massive whim filaments in the intergalactic medium with fuv absorption spectroscopy . finally , for the interpretation of the observed whim absorption features in uv and x - ray spectra the comparison between real data and artificial spectra generated by numerical simulations that include realistic gas physics is of great importance to identify possible pitfalls related to technical and physical issues such as limited signal - to - noise ratios and spectral resolution , line - broadening mechanisms , non - equilibrium conditions , and others .    in this chapter ,",
    "we review the physics and methodology of the uv and x - ray absorption measurements of warm - hot intergalactic gas at low redshift and summarise the results of recent observations obtained with space - based observatories .",
    "the outline of this chapter is the following .",
    "the ionisation conditions of the whim and the most important absorption signatures of this gas in the uv and x - ray band are presented in sect.2 .",
    "recent uv absorption measurements of the whim at low redshift are discussed in sect.3 .",
    "similarly , measurements of the whim in the x - ray are presented in sect.4 . in sect.5",
    "we compare the results from whim observations with predictions from numerical simulations and give an overview of whim measurements at high redshift .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in sect.6 .",
    "the occurrence and characteristics of the whim absorption signatures in the fuv and x - ray band are determined to a high degree by the ionisation conditions in the gas .",
    "we briefly discuss the whim ionisation properties , as this is crucial for interpretation of the whim absorption lines in fuv and x - ray spectra that arise in such warm - hot gas . generally , there are two processes that determine the ionisation state of warm - hot gas in the intergalactic medium : collisional ionisation caused by the high temperature of the gas in collapsed structures and photoionisation by the cosmic fuv background",
    ".      by far most of the mass of the whim is in the form of ionised hydrogen .",
    "therefore , understanding the processes that lead to the ionisation of hydrogen is essential for the interpretation of whim absorption lines and for a reliable estimate of the baryon content of warm - hot intergalactic gas .",
    "the ionisation potential of neutral hydrogen is @xmath6 ev and thus both ionisation by particle collisions and ionisation by high - energy photons contribute to the ionisation of h in warm - hot gas .",
    "we start with collisional ionisation , which is believed to dominate the ionisation of hydrogen at temperatures @xmath7 k.    in collisional ionisation equilibrium ( cie )  the most simple approach to characterise the ionisation conditions in low - density , high - temperature plasmas  the ionisation fraction depends only on the gas temperature . if we ignore any charge - exchange reactions ( which is justified in case of hydrogen ) , the neutral hydrogen fraction in cie is simply the ratio between the recombination coefficient @xmath8 and the collisional ionisation coefficient @xmath9 : @xmath10    above gas temperatures of @xmath11 k collisions by thermal electrons efficiently ionise hydrogen to a high degree , and already at @xmath12 k the neutral hydrogen fraction in the gas is less then one percent . for the temperature range that is characteristic for the whim , @xmath13 k , one can approximate the ionisation fraction in a collisional ionisation equilibrium in the way @xmath14 where @xmath15 is in units k ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for whim gas with @xmath16 k the neutral hydrogen fraction in the gas in cie is only @xmath17 .",
    "next to particle collisions , photons with energies @xmath18 ev contribute to the ionisation of the whim , in particular in the low - temperature whim tail at @xmath19 k and below .",
    "such ionising photons in intergalactic space are indeed provided by the metagalactic ultraviolet ( uv ) background , originating from the hard radiation emitted by qsos and agn .",

    "we have introduced the dimensionless scaling factor @xmath35 which gives the metagalactic uv radiation intensity at the lyman limit in units @xmath36 erg@xmath29s@xmath30hz@xmath30 sr@xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath20 we have @xmath37 , while for @xmath38 the value for @xmath35 is @xmath39 , thus significantly higher @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath40 and inserting a proper function for @xmath8 , we finally can write for the logarithmic neutral hydrogen fraction in a purely photoionised whim plasma @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hydrogen volume density in units @xmath1 and @xmath43 is the temperature in units @xmath44 k. thus , for purely photoionised intergalactic gas at @xmath20 with @xmath45 and @xmath16 k we find that the neutral hydrogen fraction is @xmath46 .",
    "this is ten times higher than for cie , indicating that collisions dominate the ionisation fraction of hydrogen in intermediate and high - temperature whim regions .",
    "however , note that at lower temperatures near @xmath47 k at the same density we have @xmath48 . since this is the whim temperature regime preferentially detected by uv absorption features ( e.g. , o and broad ly@xmath3 ) , photoionisation is important and needs to be accounted for when it comes to the interpretation of whim absorbers observed in the fuv . from a whim simulation at @xmath20 including both collisional ionisation and photoionisation ( @xcite ; see fig .",

    "the light gray shaded indicates cells in the density range log @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the dark gray shaded area refers to cells that have log @xmath49 to @xmath50 , thus a density range that is characteristic for whim absorbers . adapted from @xcite . ]",
    "this equation may serve as a thumb rule to estimate ionisation fractions in whim absorbers at @xmath20 if the gas temperature is known ( e.g. , from measurements of the line widths ; see sect.2.2.1 ) .",
    "/k@xmath55 , based on calculations by @xcite . ]      while hydrogen provides most of the mass in the whim , the most important diagnostic lines to study this gas phase are from highly ionised metals such as oxygen , neon , carbon , magnesium , and others .",
    "therefore , the understanding of the ionisation properties of the observed high ions of these elements is as important as for hydrogen . as for hydrogen ,",
    "both collisional ionisation and photoionisation need to be considered . with its single electron",
    ", hydrogen can only be either neutral or fully ionised .",
    "heavy elements , in contrast , have several electrons available and are  even at very high temperatures  usually only partly ionised .",
    "thus , electronic transitions exist for such highly - ionised metals ( `` high ions '' ) in warm - hot gas . of particular importance for observations of",
    "the whim are the high ionisation states of oxygen , o , o , and o , as they have strong electronic transitions in the uv ( o ) and at x - ray wavelengths ( o & o ) and oxygen is a relatively abundant element .",
    "another important metal for observing warm - hot gas in the uv and x - ray band is neon ( ne , ne , ne , ne ) . in collisional ionisation equilibrium , the ionisation state of these elements is determined solely by the temperature of the gas . for each element , the ionisation fractions of the ionisation states ( e.g. , four - times vs. five - times ionised )",
    "then are characterised by the respective ionisation potentials ( ips ) of the individual ionisation levels .",
    "for instance , at @xmath56 k , a significant fraction of the oxygen is five - times ionised ( o@xmath57 or o , ip@xmath58 ev ) .",
    "six - times ionised oxygen ( o@xmath59 or o , ip@xmath60 ev ) and seven - times ionised oxygen ( o@xmath61 or o , ip@xmath62 ev ) predominantly exist at higher temperatures in the range @xmath63 k and @xmath64 k , respectively .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows the ionisation fractions of the most important high ions of oxygen and neon , based on the cie calculations of @xcite ; see also @xcite - chapter 9 , this volume .",
    "high ions of other elements such as carbon , nitrogen , silicon and magnesium are less important for whim observations as their observable transitions trace lower temperature gas ( e.g. , c , si ) or the abundance of these elements in the intergalactic medium are too low .",
    "it is important to note at this point , that the discussed relation between ionisation state / fraction and gas temperature explicitly assumes that the gas is in an ionisation _ equilibrium_. this may not be generally the case in the whim , however , as the densities are generally very low .",
    "for instance , under particular non - equilibrium conditions the timescales for cooling , recombination , and ion / electron equilibration may differ significantly from each other ( see for instance @xcite - chapter 8 , this volume ) . in such a case ,",
    "the presence of high ions such as o and/or measured high - ion ratios would _ not _ serve as a reliable `` thermometer '' for the whim gas .",
    "in addition , whim filaments most likely neither are isothermal nor do they have a constant particle density .",
    "in fact , as whim simulations demonstrate , whim absorbers seem to represent a mix of cooler photoionised and hotter collisionally ionised gas with a substantial intrinsic density range .",
    "the absorption features from high ions arising in such a multi - phase medium therefore are generally difficult to interpret in terms of physical conditions and baryon budget .    in view of the high energies required to produce the high ions of oxygen and neon in combination with the spectral shape of the metagalactic background radiation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , photoionisation of high metal ions in the whim is less important than for hydrogen .",
    "however , for o photoionisation is important at low redshifts in whim regions with very low densities or in systems located close to a strong local radiation source ( e.g. , in o systems associated with the background qso ) .",
    "note that at high redshift , most of the intervening o appears to be photoionised owing to the significantly higher intensity of the metagalactic background radiation in the early universe ( see sect.5.2 ) .",

    "+ @xmath67 cie models from @xcite .",
    "as indicated in the previous subsection , five - times ionised oxygen ( o ) is by far the most important high ion to trace the whim at temperatures of @xmath4 k in the ultraviolet regime ( assuming cie , see above ) .",
    "oxygen is a relatively abundant element and the two lithium - like @xmath68 electronic transitions of o located in the fuv at @xmath69 and @xmath70  have large oscillator strengths ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "next to o , ne traces whim gas near @xmath72 k ( in collisional ionisation equilibrium ) and thus is possibly suited to complement the o measurements of the whim in a higher temperature regime .",
    "the two available ne lines are located in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) at @xmath73  ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath75  ( @xmath76 ) , allowing us to trace high - column density whim absorbers at redshifts @xmath77 with current fuv satellites such as fuse .",
    "however , as the cosmic abundance of ne is relatively low , ne is not expected to be a particularly sensitive tracer of the whim at the s / n levels achievable with current uv spectrographs .",
    "the same argument holds for the high ion mg , which has two transitions in the euv at even lower wavelengths ( @xmath78 609.8 , 624.9   ) .",
    "so far , only o and in one case ne has been observed in the whim at low redshift ( see sect.3.2 ) .",
    "note that whim absorption features by o ( and ne ) are mostly unsaturated and the line profiles are fully or nearly resolved by current uv instruments such as fuse and stis , which provide spectral resolutions of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "table 1 summarises physical parameters of o and ne high ions and their observable transitions in the uv and x - ray bands .    four - times ionised nitrogen ( n ;",
    "i.p . is @xmath81 ev ) also is believed to trace predominantly collisionally ionised gas at temperatures near @xmath82 k , but its lower cosmic abundance together with its deficiency in low metallicity environments due to nucleosynthesis effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) makes it very difficult to detect in the whim .",
    "other available strong high - ion transitions in the uv from carbon ( c @xmath78 1548.2 , 1550.8   ) and silicon ( si @xmath78 1393.8 , 1402.8   ) are believed to trace mainly photoionised gas at temperatures @xmath83 k , but not the shock - heated warm - hot gas at higher temperatures .",
    "next to high - ion absorption from heavy elements , recent uv observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have indicated that whim filaments can be detected in ly@xmath3 absorption of neutral hydrogen .",
    "although the vast majority of the hydrogen in the whim is ionised ( by collisional processes and uv radiation ) , a tiny fraction ( @xmath84 , typically ) of neutral hydrogen is expected to be present .",
    "depending on the total gas column density of a whim absorber and its temperature , weak h ly@xmath3 absorption at column densities @xmath85 log @xmath86(h)@xmath87 may arise from whim filaments and could be used to trace the ionised hydrogen component .",
    "the ly@xmath3 absorption from whim filaments is very broad due to thermal line broadening , resulting in large doppler parameters of @xmath88 kms@xmath30 .",
    "such lines are generally difficult to detect , as they are broad and shallow .",
    "high resolution , high s / n fuv spectra of qsos with smooth background continua are required to successfully search for broad ly@xmath3 absorption in the low - redshift whim .",
    "stis installed on the hst is the only instrument that has provided such data , but due to the instrumental limitations of space - based observatories , the number of qso spectra adequate for searching for whim broad ly@xmath3 absorption ( in the following abbreviated as `` bla '' ) is very limited .",
    "the @xmath89 values of the blas are assumed to be composed of a thermal component , @xmath90 , and a non - thermal component , @xmath91 , in the way that @xmath92    the non - thermal component may include processes like macroscopic turbulence , unresolved velocity - components , and others ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the contribution of the thermal component to @xmath89 depends on the gas temperature : @xmath93    where @xmath15 is in k , @xmath94 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath95 is the particle mass , and @xmath96 is the atomic weight . for the shock - heated whim gas with log @xmath97 one thus expects @xmath98 kms@xmath30 .",
    "the non - thermal broadening mechanisms are expected to contribute to some degree to the total @xmath89 values in whim absorbers ( see @xcite ) , so that the measured @xmath89 value of a bla provides only an upper limit for the temperature of the gas .",
    "the highest ionisation phase of the whim will produce and absorb line radiation primarily in the he- and h - like ions of the low-@xmath99 elements ( c , n , o , ne ) , and possibly in the l - shell ions of fe . in practice ,",
    "much of the attention is focused on oxygen , because of its relatively high abundance , and because the strongest resonance lines in he- and h - like o are in a relatively clean wavelength band . for reference , the ly@xmath3 transitions of c ,",
    "n , o , and ne occur at 33.7360 , 24.7810 , 18.9689 , and 12.1339  , respectively ( wavelengths of the @xmath100 doublet weighted with oscillator strength ; @xcite . the he - like ions c , n , o , and ne have their strongest transition , the @xmath101 resonance line , at 40.2674 , 28.7800 , 21.6015 , and 13.4473    ( @xcite ; see also table 1 ) .",
    "data on the higher order series members can be found in @xcite .",
    "as far as the fe l shell ions are concerned , the most likely transition to show up would be the strongest line in ne - like fe , @xmath102 @xmath103  .",
    "in addition , all lower ionisation stages of c ,",
    "n , o , and ne ( with the exception of neutral ne of course ) can also absorb by @xmath101 ; the strongest of these transitions would be @xmath104 in o at 22.019   @xcite . likewise , the lower ionisation stages of fe could in principle produce @xmath105 absorption .",
    "the thermal widths of all these transitions will be very small , requiring resolving powers of order @xmath106 ( c , n , o , ne ) for gas temperatures of order @xmath107 k to be resolved ; for fe , the requirement is even higher , by a factor @xmath108 .",
    "as we will see , for practical reasons , these requirements exceed the current capabilities of astrophysical x - ray spectroscopy by a large factor . due to the small doppler broadening ( ignoring turbulent velocity fields for now )",
    ", the lines will rapidly saturate . for he- and h - like o resonance line absorption , saturation sets in at an equivalent width of order 1 m  ( @xcite - chapter 9 , this volume ) , or column densities of order a few times @xmath109 ions @xmath29 .",
    "the challenge , therefore , for x - ray spectroscopy presented by the igm is to detect small equivalent width , near - saturation lines that are unresolved .",
    "one important result from absorption line measurements of the whim in the uv is the observed number density of whim absorbers , usually expressed as @xmath110 , the number of absorbers per unit redshift .",
    "for instance , from recent measurements with fuse and hst / stis one finds for o absorbers and broad ly@xmath3 absorbers at @xmath111 values of @xmath110(o@xmath112 and @xmath110(bla@xmath113 ( see sect.3.2 ) .",
    "currently , the whim absorber density is only measurable in the uv , since in the x - ray band both the observed number of whim absorption lines and the available redshift path for whim observations is too small to derive statistically significant values of @xmath110(o ) and @xmath110(o ) .",
    "a particularly interesting question now is , how the observed number density of high - ion lines or blas translates into an estimate of the cosmological baryon mass density of the whim , @xmath114(whim ) .",
    "to obtain such an estimate of the baryon content of the whim from uv and x - ray absorption measurements one has to consider two main steps .",
    "first , one needs to transform the observed column densities of the high ions ( e.g. , o , o , o ) into a total gas column density by modelling the ionisation conditions in the gas . in a second step ,",
    "one then integrates over the total gas column densities of all observed whim absorbers along the given redshift path and from that derives @xmath114(whim ) for a chosen cosmology . throughout the paper",
    "we will assume a @xmath115cdm cosmology with @xmath116 kms@xmath30mpc@xmath30 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "for the first step the uncertainty lies in the estimate of the ionisation fraction of hydrogen of the whim .",
    "for this , it is usually assumed that the whim is in collisional ionisation equilibrium , but photoionisation and non - equilibrium conditions may play a significant role . in the case of using metal ions such as o the unknown oxygen abundance ( o / h ) of",
    "the gas introduces an additional uncertainty ( see below ) for the estimate of @xmath114(whim ) . for the second step ,",
    "it is important to have a large enough sample of whim absorption lines and a sufficient total redshift path along _ different _ directions in order to handle statistical errors and the problem of cosmic variance .",
    "as mentioned earlier , these requirements currently are fulfilled only for the uv absorbers .",
    "the cosmological mass density @xmath114 of o absorbers ( and , similarly , for other high ions ) in terms of the current critical density @xmath120 can be estimated by @xmath121 in this equation , @xmath122 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath123 kg is the mass per hydrogen atom , @xmath124 is the adopted local hubble constant , and @xmath125 is the current critical density .",
    "the index @xmath126 denotes an individual high - ion absorption system along a line of sight @xmath127 .",
    "each measured high - ion absorption system @xmath126 is characterised by its measured ion column density ( e.g. , @xmath86(o)@xmath128 ) , the ionisation fraction of the measured ion ( e.g. , @xmath129 ) , and the local abundance of the element measured compared to hydrogen ( e.g. , the local oxygen - to - hydrogen ratio , by number ) .",
    "each line of sight @xmath127 has a characteristic redshift range @xmath130 in which high - ion absorption may be detected .",

    "these values are slightly higher than what is found by earlier analyses of smaller o samples @xcite , but lie within the cited @xmath167 error ranges .",
    "the discrepancy between the measured o number densities probably is due to the different approaches of estimating the redshift path @xmath130 along which the o absorption takes place .",
    "if one assumes that the gas is in a collisional ionisation equilibrium , i.e. , that @xmath168 percent of the oxygen is present in the form of o ( @xmath169 ) , and further assumes that the mean oxygen abundance is @xmath170 solar , the measured number density of o absorbers corresponds to a cosmological mass density of @xmath114(o)@xmath171 @xmath172 .",
    "these values imply that intervening o absorbers trace @xmath173 percent of the total baryon mass in the local universe . for the interpretation of @xmath114(o ) it has to be noted that o absorption traces collisionally ionised gas at temperatures around @xmath174 k ( and also low - density , photoionised gas at lower temperatures ) , but not the million - degree gas phase which probably contains the majority of the baryons in the whim .",
    "the recent analysis of @xcite indicates , however , that this rather simple conversion from measured o column densities to @xmath114(o ) may not be justified in general , as the cie assumption possibly breaks down for a considerable fraction of the o systems . from the measured line widths of the h ly@xmath3 absorption that is associated with the o tripp et al.conclude that @xmath175 percent of their o systems belong to cooler , photoionised gas with @xmath83 k ,",
    "possibly not at all associated with shock - heated warm - hot gas .",
    "in addition , about half of the intervening o absorbers arise in rather complex , multi - phase systems that can accommodate hot gas at relatively low metallicity .",
    "it thus appears that  without having additional information about the physical conditions in each o absorber ",
    "the estimate of the baryon budget in intervening o systems is afflicted with rather large systematic uncertainties .    in high - column density o systems at redshifts @xmath77 ,",
    "such desired additional information may be provided by the presence or absence of ne ( see sect.2.2.1 ) , which in cie traces gas at @xmath176 k. toward the quasar pg1259 + 593 @xcite have reported a tentative detection of ne absorption at @xmath177 significance in an o absorber at @xmath178 .",

    "the latter authors show that in this particular absorber the high - ion ratio ne / o@xmath182 is in agreement with gas in cie at temperature of @xmath183 k. with future high s / n absorption line data of low - redshift qsos ( as will be provided by cos ) it is expected that the number of detections of whim ne absorbers will increase substantially , so that an important new diagnostic will become available for the analysis of high - ion absorbers .",
    "one other key aspect in understanding the distribution and nature of intervening o systems concerns their relation to the large - scale distribution of galaxies . combining fuse data of 37 o absorbers with a database of more than a million galaxy positions and redshifts ,",
    "@xcite find that all of these o systems lie within @xmath184 kpc of the nearest galaxy .",
    "these results suggest that o systems preferentially arise in the immediate circumgalactic environment and extended halos of galaxies , where the metallicity of the gas is expected to be relatively high compared to regions far away from galactic structures .",
    "some very local analogs of intervening o systems thus may be the o high - velocity clouds in the local group that are discussed in the next subsection .",

    "they conclude that blas host at least 20 percent of the baryons in the local universe , while the photoionised ly@xmath3 forest , which produces a large number of narrow ly@xmath3 absorbers ( nlas ) , contributes with @xmath202 percent to the total baryon budget .",
    "in addition , @xcite have investigated the properties of blas at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath203 ) along five other quasars using stis high- and intermediate - resolution data .",
    "they find a number density of reliably detected bla candidates of @xmath204 and obtain a lower limit of the contribution of blas to the total baryon budget of @xmath108 percent in this redshift range .",
    "the frequency and baryon content of blas at intermediate redshifts obviously is lower than at @xmath20 , indicating that at intermediate redshifts shock - heating of the intergalactic gas from the infall in large - scale filaments is not yet very efficient .",
    "this is in line with the predictions from cosmological simulations .",
    "one primary goal of the fuse mission was to constrain the distribution and kinematics of hot gas in the thick disk and lower halo of the milky way by studying the properties of galactic o absorption systems at radial velocities @xmath205 kms@xmath30 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , as the fuse data unveil , o absorption associated with milky way gas is observed not only at low velocities but also at @xmath206 kms@xmath30 @xcite . the topic of cool and hot gas in the halo of the milky way recently has been reviewed by @xcite",
    "these detections imply that next to the milky way s hot `` atmosphere '' ( i.e. , the galactic corona ) individual pockets of hot gas exist that move with high velocities through the circumgalactic environment of the milky way .",
    "such high - velocity o absorbers may contain a substantial fraction of the baryonic matter in the local group in the form of warm - hot gas and thus  as discussed in the previous subsection  possibly represent the local counterparts of some of the intervening o absorbers observed towards low - redshift qsos .    from their fuse survey of high - velocity o absorption @xcite",

    "some of the high - velocity o detected with fuse appears to be associated with known high - velocity h 21  cm structures ( e.g. , the high - velocity clouds complex a , complex c , the magellanic stream , and the outer arm ) .",
    "other high - velocity o features , however , have no counterparts in h 21  cm emission . the high radial velocities for most of these o absorbers",
    "are incompatible with those expected for the hot coronal gas ( even if the coronal gas motion is decoupled from the underlying rotating disk ) .",
    "a transformation from the local standard of rest to the galactic standard of rest and the local group standard of rest velocity reference frames reduces the dispersion around the mean of the high - velocity o centroids ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as evidence that _ some _ of the o high - velocity absorbers are intergalactic clouds in the local group rather than clouds directly associated with the milky way .",
    "however , it is extremely difficult to discriminate between a local group explanation and a distant galactic explanation for these absorbers .",
    "the presence of intergalactic o absorbing gas in the local group is in line with theoretical models that predict that there should be a large reservoir of hot gas left over from the formation of the local group ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the high - velocity o is produced by photoionisation .",
    "probably , the gas is collisionally ionised at temperatures of several @xmath185 k. the o then may be produced in the turbulent interface regions between very hot ( @xmath186 k ) gas in an extended galactic corona and the cooler gas clouds that are moving through this hot medium ( see @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for the existence of such interfaces also comes from the comparison of absorption lines from neutral and weakly ionised species with absorption from high ions like o @xcite .",
    "with the advent of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories , high resolution x - ray spectroscopy of a wide variety of cosmic sources became feasible for the first time . among the possible results most eagerly speculated upon was the detection of intergalactic absorption lines from highly ionised metals in the continuum spectra of bright extragalactic sources .",
    "after all , one of the most striking results from the _ einstein _ observatory had been the detection of a very significant broad absorption feature at @xmath209 ev in the spectrum of pks2155@xmath181304 with the objective grating spectrometer @xcite .",
    "ironically , if interpreted as intergalactic h - like o ly@xmath3 absorption , redshifted and broadened by the expansion of the universe , the strength of the feature implied the presence of a highly ionised igm of near - critical density , a possibility that has of course definitively been discounted since then .    the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; @xcite ) and the low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ; @xcite ) on _ chandra _ , and the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) on _ xmm - newton _ @xcite were the first instruments to provide sensitivity to weak interstellar and intergalactic x - ray absorption lines .",
    "the traditional ionisation detectors ( proportional counters , ccd s ) do not have sufficient energy resolution for this application .",
    "but the angular resolution provided by an x - ray telescope can be used to produce a high resolution spectrum , by the use of diffracting elements .",
    "laboratory x - ray spectroscopy is typically performed with crystal diffraction spectrometers , and the use of crystal spectrometers for general use in astrophysics was pioneered on the _ einstein _ observatory ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the focal plane crystal spectrometer indeed detected the first ever narrow x - ray absorption line in a cosmic source , the @xmath104 absorption by neutral oxygen in the interstellar medium towards the crab @xcite .",
    "previous grating spectrometers ( the objective grating spectrometer on _ einstein _ and the two transmission grating spectrometers on _ exosat _ ) had only limited resolution and sensitivity .",
    "but there is no fundamental limit to the resolution of a diffraction grating spectrometer , and the high angular resolution of the _ chandra _ telescope has allowed for high resolution spectroscopy using transmission gratings .",
    "the focusing optics on _ xmm - newton _ have more modest angular resolution , but they are used with a fixed array of grazing incidence reflection gratings , which produce very large dispersion angles and thus high spectral resolution .",
    "the hetgs provides a spectral resolution of @xmath210   over the @xmath211   band with the high line density grating , and @xmath212   over the @xmath213   band with the medium line density grating .",
    "the letgs has @xmath214   over the @xmath215   band , while the rgs has @xmath216   over the @xmath217   band .",
    "these numbers translate to resolving powers of @xmath218 in the o k band , and with a sufficiently bright continuum source , one should be able to detect equivalent widths of order @xmath219  ev ( @xmath220  m ) , or below in spectra with very high signal - to - noise .",
    "the predictions for h- and he - like o resonance absorption line strengths are generally smaller than these thresholds , but not grossly so , and so a search for intergalactic o was initiated early on . given that the current spectrometers are not expected to resolve the absorption lines , the only freedom we have to increase the sensitivity of the search is to increase the signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum , and it becomes crucial to find suitable , very bright sources , at redshifts that are large enough that there is a reasonable a priori probability of finding a filament with detectable line absorption .",
    "as we will see when we discuss the results of the observational searches for x - ray absorption lines , the problem is made considerably more difficult by the very sparseness of the expected absorption signature .",
    "frequently , when absorption features of marginal statistical significance are detected in astrophysical data , plausibility is greatly enhanced by simple , unique spectroscopic arguments .",
    "for instance , for all plausible parameter configurations , an absorbing gas cloud detected in n should also produce detectable c absorption ; or , both members of a doublet should appear in the correct strength ratio if unsaturated . in the early stages of ly@xmath3 forest astrophysics , it was arguments of this type , rather than the crossing of formal statistical detection thresholds alone , that guided the field ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but for the x - ray forest absorption , we expect a very different situation .",
    "the detailed simulations confirm what simple analytical arguments had suggested : in most cases , intergalactic absorption systems that are in principle detectable with current or planned x - ray instrumentation will show just a single absorption line , usually the o @xmath101 resonance line , at an unknown redshift .",
    "when assessing the possibility that a given apparent absorption feature is real , one has to allow for the number of independent trial redshifts ( very roughly given by the width of the wavelength band surveyed , divided by the nominal spectral resolution of the spectrometer ) , and with a wide band and a high spectral resolution , this tends to dramatically reduce the significance of even fairly impressive apparent absorption dips .",
    "for instance , an apparent absorption line detected at a formal 3@xmath221 significance ( or @xmath222 a priori probability for a negative deviation this large to occur due to statistical fluctuation ) with _ chandra _ letgs in the @xmath223   band pales to 1.7 @xmath221 if we assume it is the o resonance line in the redshift range @xmath224 ; with @xmath225 independent trials , the chances of not seeing a @xmath226 excursion are @xmath227 , or : one will see such a feature one in twenty times if one tries this experiment ( we are assuming a gaussian distribution of fluctuations here ) .",
    "if we allow for confusion with o ly@xmath3 at higher redshift , or even other transitions , the significance is even further reduced . and the larger the number of sources surveyed , the larger the probability of false alarm .",
    "clearly , more reliable statistics on intervening x - ray absorbers and detections at higher significance are desired , but the required high - quality data will not be available until the next - generation x - ray facilities such as _ xeus _ and _ constellation x _ are installed ( see @xcite - chapter 19 , this volume ) .    nevertheless , even with these odds , the above discussed high - ion measurements",
    "are important observations to do with the currently available instruments _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. given the predicted strengths of the absorption lines ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also sect.5.1 ) , attention has naturally focused on a handful of very bright bl lac- and similar sources .",
    "below , we discuss the results of the searches .",
    "note that the subject has recently also been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "the first attempt at detecting redshifted x - ray o absorption lines was performed by @xcite with a dedicated deep observation ( 470 ks ) with the _ chandra _ letgs of the quasar h1821 + 643 , which has several confirmed intervening o absorbers .",
    "no significant x - ray absorption lines were found at the redshifts of the o systems , but this was not really surprising in view of the modest signal to noise ratio in the x - ray continuum .",
    "since it requires very bright continua to detect the weak absorption , it is also not surprising that the number of suitable extragalactic sources is severely limited .",
    "early observations of a sample of these ( e.g. s50836 + 710 , pks2149@xmath181306 ; @xcite ; pks2155@xmath181304 , @xcite ) produced no convincing detections . nicastro and his colleagues then embarked on a campaign to observe mrk421 during its periodic x - ray outbursts , when its x - ray flux rises by an order of magnitude ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the net result of this has been the accumulation of a very deep spectrum with the _ chandra _ letgs , with a total of more than 7 million continuum counts , in about 1000 resolution elements . @xcite",
    "have claimed evidence for the detection of two intervening absorption systems in these data , at @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "but the spectrum of the same source observed with the _ xmm - newton _ rgs does not show these absorption lines @xcite , despite higher signal - to - noise and comparable spectral resolution ( mrk 421 is observed by _ xmm - newton _ for calibration purposes , and by late 2006 , more than 1 ms exposure had been accumulated ) . @xcite",
    "have reanalysed the _",
    "letgs data , and find no significant absorption .",
    "other sources , less bright but with larger redshifts , have been observed ( see for instance @xcite for observations of 1es1028 + 511 at @xmath230 ) , but to date no convincing evidence for intervening absorption has materialised .",
    "observations have been conducted to try and detect the absorption by intergalactic gas presumably associated with known locations of cosmic overdensity , centred on massive clusters .",
    "@xcite attempted to detect absorption in the quasar lbqs 1228 + 1116 , located behind the virgo cluster .",
    "xmm - newton _ rgs spectrum revealed a marginal feature at the ( virgo ) redshifted position of o ly@xmath3 , but only at the @xmath231% confidence level .",
    "likewise , @xcite took advantage of the location of x comae behind the coma cluster to try and detect absorption from coma or its surroundings , but no convincing , strong absorption lines were detected in a deep observation with _ xmm - newton _ rgs .",
    "the parallel ccd imaging data obtained with epic show weak evidence for ne @xmath101 line emission at the redshift of coma , which , if real , would most likely be associated with whim gas around the cluster , seen in projection ( the cluster virial temperature is too high for ne ) . in practice , the absence of very bright point sources behind clusters , which makes absorption studies difficult , and the bright foregrounds in emission , will probably make this approach to detecting and characterizing the whim not much easier than the random line - of - sight searches .",
    "the conclusion from the search for intergalactic x - ray absorption is that there is no convincing , clear detection for intervening absorption .",
    "this is , in retrospect , not that surprising , given the sensitivity of the current x - ray spectrometers , the abundance of suitably bright and sufficiently distant continuum sources , and the predicted properties of the whim .",
    "the first positive result of the analysis of bright continuum spectra was the detection of o and o @xmath101 resonance line absorption at redshift zero .",
    "@xcite first identified the resonance lines in the _ chandra _ letgs spectrum of pks2155@xmath181304 ( o @xmath101 , @xmath232 , o ly@xmath3 , ne @xmath101 ) .",

    "the measured ionisation balance then implies a length scale on the order of @xmath233 mpc , where @xmath234 is the metallicity in units 0.1 solar . this is a very large length , and even for @xmath235 metallicity",

    "if one assumes solar abundance and sets the o fraction to 0.5 , the characteristic density becomes @xmath238  @xmath1 , and the length scale ( @xmath239  kpc ) suggests a hot galactic halo , rather than a local group intragroup medium .",
    "arguments for both type of solution ( a small compact halo and a more tenuous local group medium ) can be given .",
    "the most direct of these is a measurement of the o line absorption towards the lmc by @xcite in the spectrum of the x - ray binary lmc x-3 , which indicates that a major fraction of the o column in that direction is in fact in front of the lmc .",
    "@xcite points out that the distribution of column densities of highly ionised o on the sky is not strongly correlated with the likely projected mass distribution of the local group , and that the measured velocity centroid of the absorption lines appears characteristic of milky way gas , rather than local group gas . on the other hand",

    "regardless , the prospect of directly observing hot gas expelled from the galactic disk , or measuring the virial temperature of the galaxy and/or the local group is exciting enough to warrant further attention to redshift zero absorption and emission .",
    "finally , the spectrum of mrk421 shows the expected @xmath242 innershell o absorption , at 22.019   , both with _ chandra _ and with _ xmm - newton_. there has been some confusion regarding an apparent discrepancy between the o column densities derived from the fuv and from the x - ray absorption lines , in the sense that the x - ray column appeared to be significantly larger than the fuv column @xcite .",
    "proposed physical explanations for this effect involve a depletion of the lower level of the fuv transitions ( @xmath243 ) in favour of ( at least ) @xmath244 , which weakens the @xmath245 absorption but does not affect the @xmath104 x - ray absorption .",
    "however , it requires very high densities to maintain a finite excited state population , and , more directly , the measured wavelength of the x - ray line is actually not consistent with the wavelength calculated for @xmath104 in excited o , off by about @xmath246  , on the order of a full resolution element of both the _ chandra _ letgs and the _ xmm - newton _ rgs ( raassen 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the discrepancy is due to an authentic statistical fluctuation in the x - ray spectrum  or , more ironically , to the presence of a weak , slightly redshifted o absorption line .",
    "cosmological simulations not only have been used to investigate the large - scale distribution and physical state of the warm - hot intergalactic medium , they also have been applied to predict statistical properties of high - ion absorption systems that can be readily compared with the uv and x - ray measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "about 30 percent of the blas in the simulation originate in the photoionised ly@xmath3 forest ( log @xmath254 ) and their large line widths are determined by non - thermal broadening effects such as unresolved velocity structure and macroscopic turbulence .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows two examples of the velocity profiles of blas generated from simulations presented in @xcite .",
    "the results from the analysis of artificially generated uv spectra underline that the comparison between whim simulations and quasar absorption line studies indeed are quite important for improving both the physical models in cosmological simulations and the strategies for future observations of the warm - hot intergalactic gas .",
    "although this chapter concentrates on the properties of whim absorbers at low redshift ( as visible in uv and x - ray absorption ) a few words about high - ion absorption at high redshifts ( @xmath256 ) shall be given at this point . at redshifts @xmath256 , by far most of the baryons are residing in the photoionised intergalactic medium that gives rise to the ly@xmath3 forest .",
    "at this early epoch of the universe , baryons situated in galaxies and in warm - hot intergalactic gas created by large - scale structure formation contribute together with only @xmath257 percent to the total baryon content of the universe . despite the relative unimportant role of the whim at high @xmath187 , o",
    "absorbers are commonly found in optical spectra of high - redshift quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ; carswell et al .",
    "@xcite ; simcoe et al .",
    "the observation of intervening o absorbers at high redshift is much easier than in the local universe , since the absorption features are redshifted into the optical regime and thus are easily accessible with ground - based observatories . however , blending problems with the numerous h ly@xmath3 forest lines at high @xmath187 are much more severe than for low - redshift sightlines . because of the higher intensity of the metagalactic uv background at high redshift",
    "it is expected that many of the o systems in the early universe are photoionised .",
    "collisional ionisation of o yet may be important for high - redshift absorbers that originate in galactic winds ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while for low redshifts the population of o absorbers is important for the search of the `` mission baryons '' that are locked in the whim phase in the local universe , o absorbers at high redshift are believed to represent a solution for the problem of the `` missing metals '' in the early epochs of structure formation .",
    "this problem arises from the facts that at high redshift an igm metallicity of @xmath258 is expected from the star - formation activity of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) , while observations of intervening c absorption systems suggest an igm abundance of only @xmath259 solar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , thus more than one order of magnitude too low .",
    "possibly , most of the missing metals at high @xmath187 are hidden in highly - ionised hot gaseous halos that surround the star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and thus should be detectable only with high ions such as o rather than with intermediate ions such as c. using the uves spectrograph installed on the _ very large telescope _ ( vlt ) @xcite have studied the properties of high - redshift o absorbers along ten qso sightlines and have found possible evidence for such a scenario .",
    "additional studies are required to investigate the nature of high-@xmath187 o systems and their relation to galactic structures in more detail . however , from the existing measurements clearly follows that the study of high - ion absorbers at large redshifts is of great importance to our understanding of the formation and evolution of galactic structures at high @xmath187 and the transport of metals into the igm .      the analysis of absorption features from high ions of heavy elements and neutral hydrogen currently represents the best method to study baryon content , physical properties , and distribution of the warm - hot intergalactic gas in large - scale filaments at low and high redshift .",
    "however , the interpretation of these spectral signatures in terms of whim baryon content and origin still is afflicted with rather large systematic uncertainties due to the limited data quality and the often poorly known physical conditions in whim absorbers ( e.g. , ionisation conditions , metal content , etc . ) .",
    "future instruments in the uv ( e.g. , cos ) and in the x - ray band ( e.g. , _ xeus _ , _ constellation x _ ) hold the prospect of providing large amounts of new data on the whim with good signal - to - noise ratios and substantially improved absorber statistics .",
    "these missions therefore will be of great importance to improve our understanding of this important intergalactic gas phase .",
