    "nonlinear magneto - electric ( me ) effects , in particular magnetic - field control of ferroelectric polarization ( @xmath7 ) , in me - multiferroics have been intensively studied since the discovery of the colossal me - effect in some magnetically frustrated transition metal oxides.@xcite in most of the me - multiferroics , the magnetic field dependences of @xmath7 have been attributed to changes in the magnetic structures . for example , the magnetic - field - induced 90@xmath11-flop of @xmath7 in tbmno@xmath12 has been explained by the first - order magnetic phase transition from the @xmath13-plane cycloidal magnetic ordering to the @xmath14-plane cycloidal magnetic ordering.@xcite on the other hand , the recent experimental works have pointed out that magnetic control of ` magnetic domain structures ' can be an another ingredient for the me - effects , in some relatively high - symmetry ( trigonal , tetragonal or hexagonal ) multiferroics.@xcite for example , kimura _ et al . _",
    "have argued that an anisotropic magnetic field dependence of @xmath7 in a trigonal me - multiferroic cucro@xmath2 can be ascribed to the magnetic field dependence of the volume fractions of the three magnetic domains , in which the three magnetic modulation wave vectors characterizing these domains are equivalent to each other because of the trigonal symmetry of the crystal structure.@xcite this suggests that trigonal ( or tetragonal , hexagonal ) me - multiferroics can provide opportunities for realizing a variety of magnetic field responses of @xmath7 . in the past several years , a trigonal me - multiferroic cufeo@xmath2 ( cfo ) has been the subject of increasing interest as a me - multiferroic because of the discovery of the ferroelectricity in a magnetic - field - induced phase.@xcite subsequent studies have elucidated that the ferroelectric phase is stabilized even under zero magnetic field by substituting small amount of nonmagnetic al@xmath15 or ga@xmath15 ions for the magnetic fe@xmath15 sites.@xcite the magnetic structure in the ferroelectric phase has been determined to be a proper - screw - type helical magnetic structure.@xcite the magnetic modulation wave vector is @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and the helical axis is parallel to the @xmath18 $ ] axis.@xcite hereafter , we refer to the ferroelectric phase as ferroelectric incommensurate - magnetic ( fe - icm ) phase .",
    "recent polarized neutron diffraction studies have revealed that the spin - helicity , left - handed ( lh ) or right - handed ( rh ) helical arrangement of spins , determines the polarity of the local ferroelectric polarization emerging along the helical axis.@xcite because of the threefold rotational symmetry about the hexagonal @xmath6 axis ( see fig.[cryst_str](a ) ) , the magnetic ordering with the wave vector of @xmath16 results in three magnetic domains whose wave vectors of @xmath16 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are crystallographically equivalent to each other , as illustrated in fig .",

    "we firstly discuss the metamagnetic transition in this system using the results of the magnetization measurements . in @xmath24 up to 30 t ,",
    "three magnetic phases appear , as shown in figs .",
    "[ pulse_p_m](a-2)-[pulse_p_m](a-3 ) . in the previous work on cfao(@xmath52),@xcite terada _",
    "et al . _ have reported that the first field induced phase from the fe - icm phase is the slightly incommensurate magnetic phase referred to as the ` fi phase ' .",
    "we thus considered that the first field induced phase from the fe - icm phase in cfao ( @xmath3 ) is the fi phase . around @xmath73 t , where the induced magnetization approaches @xmath74 , the system undergoes further magnetic phase transition . in the in - plane magnetic fields , magnetization plateaus with the magnetization of @xmath74",
    "were also observed around 23 t. comparing the results of the previous magnetization measurements on pure cfo under pulsed magnetic field,@xcite we realize that this magnetic phase is the 3-sublattice ( 3sl ) phase , which is also observed in pure cfo.@xcite let us move on to the results of the dielectric polarization measurements . in @xmath24 , the finite electric polarization was observed only in the fe - icm phase , as shown in figs .",
    "[ pulse_p_m](a-2)-[pulse_p_m](a-3 ) . in the @xmath24-increasing process",
    ", @xmath7 rapidly increases in the magnetic field region of @xmath75 t. this enhancement corresponds to the magnetic field dependences of the magnetic correlation and the magnetic modulation wave number , which were observed in the present neutron diffraction measurements . in the @xmath24-decreasing process , @xmath7 is also observed to emerge in the fe - icm phase .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath24-increasing process , the value of @xmath7 is almost independent of the magnetic field , and is larger than the value in the zero field state before the measurement .",
    "judging from the symmetry of the magnetic and crystal structure in this system , it is reasonable to assume that the volume fractions of the three @xmath21-domains are not changed by @xmath24 .",
    "hence , we ascribed this @xmath24-variations of @xmath7 to the history dependent behavior of the fe - icm order in a @xmath21-domain observed in the present neutron diffraction measurements .",
    "figures [ pulse_p_m](b-3 ) and [ pulse_p_m](c-3 ) show the ` in - plane ' magnetic field dependences of @xmath7 measured at relatively low temperature , @xmath60 k. from the results of the present neutron diffraction measurements , it is expected that the magnetic - field - induced re - populations of the @xmath21-domains result in anisotropic magnetic field variations of @xmath7 . however , the expected anisotropic behaviors are not observed , although the details of the @xmath7-@xmath56 and @xmath7-@xmath55 curves are slightly different from each other .",
    "this result suggests that the sweeping rate of the pulsed magnetic fields were too fast to induce the re - population of the @xmath21-domains . on the other hand , at @xmath66",
    "k , we found that the in - plane field variations of @xmath7 were quite anisotropic , as shown in figs .",
    "[ pulse_p_m](b-2 ) and [ pulse_p_m](c-2 ) . in the @xmath56-increasing process ,",
    "the value of @xmath7 started to decrease around 8 t , and disappeared around 15 t , which is far below the transition field to the 3sl phase .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath55-increasing process , the finite value of @xmath7 is observed up to the transition field to the 3sl phase .",
    "these results revealed that the ` in - plane ' field induced fe - icm to pd transition in a @xmath21-domain occurs even in the pulsed magnetic fields .",
    "it should be noted that this field induced fe - icm to pd phase transition is not clearly observed in the magnetization measurement .",
    "this is because the fe - icm to pd phase transition occurs only in the @xmath21-domains with the wave vectors of @xmath16 and @xmath76 while all the three @xmath21-domains contributes to the measured magnetization .",
    "we also found that in the @xmath56- and @xmath55-decreasing process , the values of @xmath7 are significantly smaller compared to the values in zero field before the measurements , in contrast to the @xmath24-decreasing process , in which @xmath7 was comparable to the value at the initial state . at this stage , we have no clear explanation for this result . in order to investigate this point , further neutron diffraction measurements under applied magnetic fields are required . in figs .",
    "[ pulse_p_m](d ) and [ pulse_p_m](e ) , we show the @xmath24-dependence of the magnetization and @xmath7 up to 55 t , respectively .",
    "although , in this paper , we do not focus on the high - magnetic - field behavior in this system , it is worth mentioning here that the fifth - magnetic - field - induced phase transition , which has been recently found in pure cfo,@xcite was also observed in cfao(@xmath3 ) around @xmath77 t. no finite electric polarization was detected in the magnetic - field - induced phases including the ` fifth ' phase .",
    "we have investigated the magnetic field dependence of the fe - icm order in the trigonal me - multiferroic cufe@xmath0al@xmath1o@xmath2 with @xmath3 by means of the neutron diffraction , dielectric polarization and magnetization measurements under the magnetic fields applied along various directions .",
    "we have established the @xmath4-@xmath5 magnetic phase diagrams for the three principal directions of the magnetic fields , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . it should be emphasized that these @xmath4-@xmath5 phase diagrams represent the magnetic ordering ` in a @xmath21-domain ' , and reveal the anisotropic in - plane - magnetic - field responses of the fe - icm order in a @xmath21-domain , which was not directly observed in the previous macroscopic ( bulk ) polarization and magnetization measurements.@xcite we have also found that the sensitivity of @xmath7 to @xmath27 in this system was controlled by applying a magnetic field .",
    "this indicates that the ` inhomogeneity ' of the fe - icm order , which is also controlled by an applied magnetic field , is relevant to the sensitivity of @xmath7 to @xmath27 .",
    "this result is consistent with our previous polarized neutron diffraction study on cfao(@xmath3 ) and cfgo(@xmath8).@xcite while the recent dielectric polarization measurements on cufe@xmath0ga@xmath1o@xmath2 with @xmath8 by seki _ et al . _ have demonstrated that the magnetic field dependence of the ` magnetic domain structure ' , specifically the volume fractions of the three @xmath21-domains , results in the distinct magnetic field responses of @xmath7,@xcite the present results have revealed the anisotropic magnetic field dependence of the fe - icm order ` in each @xmath21-domain ' can be also a source of a variety of the magnetic field dependence of @xmath7 in this system .",
