    "recent studies have started to tackle the formation and collapse of the first cosmic structures ( often referred to as popiii objects ) through numerical simulations ( abel 1998 ; bromm , coppi & larson 1999 ; abel , bryan & norman 2000 ; bromm 2001 ) based on hierarchical scenarios of structure formation .",
    "these studies have shown that gravitational collapse induces fragmentation of pre - galactic units with an initial baryonic mass @xmath12 into smaller clumps with a typical mass of @xmath13 , which corresponds to the jeans mass set by molecular hydrogen cooling .",
    "however , a considerable mass range ( @xmath14 ) for the clumps seems plausible .",
    "tracking the subsequent gravitational collapse of these metal free clumps is a very challenging problem as it requires the simultaneous solution of hydrodynamics and of ( cooling lines ) radiative transfer ( omukai & nishi 1998 ; nakamura & umemura 1999 ; ripamonti 2001 ) .",
    "preliminary attempts and several physical arguments indicate that these clumps do not fragment into smaller units as the evolution progresses to higher densities .",
    "independent studies ( hernandez & ferrara 2001 ) comparing the observed number of metal poor stars with that predicted by cosmological models , also imply that the characteristic stellar mass sharply increases with redshift .",
    "hence , there are grounds to believe that the first stars were very massive .",
    "the evolution of massive , metal free stars is currently subject to a rapidly growing number of studies ( fryer 1999 ; fryer , woosley & heger 2001 ; heger & woosley 2001 ) which rejuvenate earlier activity ( fowler & hoyle 1964 ; carr , bond & arnett 1984 ; el eid 1983 ; fricke 1973 ; fuller 1986 ) .",
    "as we discuss in detail later in the paper , stars more massive than about 260 @xmath15 collapse completely to black holes , therefore not contributing to the metal enrichment of the surrounding gas .",
    "similar arguments apply to stars in a lower mass window ( 30 @xmath15 - 140 @xmath15 ) , which are also expected to end their evolution as black holes . hence ,",
    "if supernovae from more standard progenitors ( stellar masses in the range 8 @xmath15 - 40 @xmath15 ) are either not formed efficiently or occur in negligible numbers , it appears that the initial cosmic metal enrichment had to rely on the heavy element yield from the so - called pair - unstable supernovae ( ) , whose explosion leaves no remnant .",
    "this conclusion can potentially be tested by studying peculiar elemental abundances , for example of heavy _",
    "r-_process elements ( oh 2001 ) .",
    "metallicity is thought to noticeably affect the fragmentation properties of a gravitationally unstable gas .",
    "for example , bromm ( 2001 ) have shown that the evolution of a collapsing proto - galaxy depends strongly on the level of gas pre - enrichment .",
    "these authors argue that a critical metallicity @xmath16 exists such that , above that value vigorous fragmentation into relatively low mass ( @xmath17 ) clumps takes place , differently from what is discussed above under metal - free conditions .",
    "the key question then concerns the interplay between the properties of the imf and the metal enrichment of the gas .",
    "to better illustrate this , let us ideally suppose that the first stars are all formed  as suggested by numerical simulations  with masses above the mass threshold , thus leading to the formation of black holes . then , because metals are completely swallowed by the latter , the gas retains its primordial composition and star formation continues in the high - mass biased mode .",
    "a solution to this `` star formation conundrum '' must evidently exist as at present stars form with a much lower characteristic mass ( @xmath18 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we describe in detail a possible solution to this conundrum utilizing various constraints : metal abundance patterns in clusters , the mass density of super - massive black holes , off - nuclear galactic x - ray sources and , to a more speculative extent , the nature of a particular class ( optically hidden ) of gamma - ray bursts - we attempt to infer the main properties of the early stages of cosmic star formation .",
    "in this section , we focus on the first episode of star formation and discuss the relevant cooling criteria and timescales in detail .",
    "we work within the paradigm of hierarchical cold dark matter ( cdm ) models for structure formation , wherein dark matter halos collapse and the baryons in them condense , cool , and eventually form stars . once a halo of mass @xmath19 collapses at redshift of @xmath20 , the baryons are shock - heated to the virial temperature given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the molecular weight . if @xmath24 [ or equivalently @xmath25 , the baryonic gas cools due to the excitation of hydrogen ly@xmath26 line . in the absence of metals ,",
    "as expected for the very first episode of star formation , objects with @xmath27 can cool only through the collisional excitation of molecular hydrogen .",
    "hereafter , in this work , we refer to the former objects as ly@xmath26-cooling halos and to the latter as popiii objects .",
    "the first stars form once the gas cools .",
    "the typical initial mass function ( imf ) of this first generation of stars is still highly uncertain .",
    "several authors have tackled this crucial issue through theoretical ( rees 1976 ; rees & ostriker 1977 ; silk 1977 , 1983 ; haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 ; uehara 1996 ) and numerical approaches ( omukai & nishi 1998 ; nakamura & umemura 1999 , 2001 ; abel , bryan & norman 2000 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2001 ; omukai 2000 , 2001 ; ripamonti 2001 ) .",
    "recent multi - dimensional simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of primordial gas within popiiis , show preliminary indications that the imf could be either top - heavy with typical masses of order @xmath28 ( abel , bryan & norman 2000 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2001 ) or bimodal with peaks at @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( nakamura & umemura 2001 ) .",
    "note , that these numerical treatments can not address the issue of the mass spectrum .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand what physical processes set the scales of fragment masses and hence the stellar mass spectrum .",
    "it is obvious that much hinges on the physics of cooling , primarily the number of channels available for the gas to cool and the efficiency of the process ( rees & ostriker 1977 ) . in general",
    ", cooling is efficient when the cooling time @xmath31 is much shorter than the free - fall time @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 ; where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the gas number ( mass ) density and @xmath36 is the net radiative cooling rate [ erg @xmath37 .",
    "this efficiency condition implies that the energy deposited by gravitational contraction can not balance the radiative losses ; as a consequence , temperature decreases with increasing density . under such circumstances ,",
    "the cloud cools and then fragments . at",
    "any given time , fragments form on a scale that is small enough to ensure pressure equilibrium at the corresponding temperature , the jeans length scale , r_f _",
    "j c_s t_ff n^/2 -1 [ eq : rf ] where the sound speed @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the adiabatic index .",
    "since @xmath41 varies on the cooling timescale , the corresponding @xmath42 becomes smaller as @xmath43 decreases .",
    "similarly , the corresponding fragment mass is the jeans mass , m_f n r_f^ n^/2 + ( 1- ) , [ eq : jm ] with @xmath44 for filaments and @xmath45 for spherical fragments ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "this hierarchical fragmentation process comes to an end when cooling becomes inefficient because _ ( i ) _ the critical density for lte is reached or _",
    "( ii ) _ the gas becomes optically thick to cooling radiation ; in both cases , at that juncture @xmath46 . at this stage , the temperature can not decrease any further and it either remains constant ( if energy deposition by gravitational contraction is exactly balanced by radiative losses ) or increases .",
    "the necessary condition to stop fragmentation and start gravitational contraction within each fragment is that the jeans mass does not decrease any further , thus favoring fragmentation into sub - clumps . from eq .",
    "[ eq : jm ] , this implies the following condition : 2 , [ cond ] which translates into @xmath47 for a spherical fragment and @xmath48 for a filament .",
    "thus , a filament is marginally stable and contracts quasi - statically when , @xmath49 , and the gas becomes isothermal .",
    "finally , when @xmath50 or the fragments become optically thick to cooling radiation , the temperature increases as the contraction proceeds adiabatically .      in this subsection , we follow the evolution of metal - free primordial clumps during the fragmentation process .",
    "these results are based on the model of omukai ( 2001 ) .",
    "the gas within the dark matter halo is given an initial temperature of @xmath51 and the subsequent thermal and chemical evolution of the gravitationally collapsing cloud is followed numerically until a central proto - stellar core forms .",
    "the gas within the dark matter halo gets shock - heated to the virial temperature @xmath52 , which is typically @xmath53 .",
    "however , after a short transient phase ( irrelevant for the present analysis ) , the evolutionary track in the @xmath54 plane shown in fig .  1 ( top curve , upper panel ) provides a good description of the thermal evolution of the gas .",
    "the metal - free gas is able to cool down to temperatures of a few hundred kelvin regardless of the initial virial temperature .",
    "this is the minimum temperature at which molecular line cooling becomes effective .    in this analysis , external sources of heating",
    "are not included ( external uv background or cmb radiation ) .",
    "this is because at redshifts prior to reionization the uv background field is relatively weak and inhomogeneous ( ciardi , ferrara , & abel 2000 ) , hence we do not expect it to be important .",
    "also , the cmb energy input is negligible for clouds with @xmath55  k ( or @xmath56 ) where the first stars presumably formed at redshifts @xmath57 .",
    "it might affect the temperature evolution of more metal rich systems shown in fig .  1 , but does not modify the conclusions drawn here .",
    "the gas within halos with @xmath58  k starts to cool through the hydrogen ly@xmath26 line .",
    "it quickly reaches a temperature of @xmath59 and , at this stage , the fraction of molecular hydrogen formed is sufficient to activate h@xmath60 ro - vibrational line cooling .",
    "thereafter , the gas within a ly@xmath26-cooling halo follows the same thermal evolution as the gas within popiiis .",
    "independent of the virial temperature , the thermal evolution of the gas rapidly converges to the @xmath54 track corresponding to @xmath61 ( the zero metallicity track ) , shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the temperature of the gas decreases with increasing density , thus favoring fragmentation into sub - clumps .    as the number density increases",
    ", it reaches the critical value @xmath62 ; and the corresponding jeans mass is @xmath63 ( empty dot in the upper panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "the cooling time at this critical point becomes comparable to the free fall time as a consequence of the levels being populated according to lte [ regime where the cooling rate @xmath64 and no longer according to nlte [ regime where @xmath65 .",
    "the temperature then starts to rise slowly .    at this stage",
    ", the stability of the fragments toward further increase in the density needs to be investigated according to the condition eq .",
    "[ cond ] above .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the density dependence of @xmath40 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : rf ] ) for each metallicity track . for a metal - free gas @xmath40 lies in the range @xmath66 , implying that further fragmentation is unlikely to occur unless the fragments are spherical .",
    "although the gravitational evolution will probably favor a tendency towards spherical symmetry , this is not likely to occur until the central density has reached high ( @xmath67 ) values as seen from simulations ( abel 2000 ) .",
    "the only two deviations from the above range occur ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "1 ) around @xmath68 and @xmath69 . the former is a result of the thermal instability due to three - body h@xmath70 formation ( silk 1983 ; haiman et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , this instability is quite weak and does not lead to fragmentation ( abel et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the latter ( at @xmath71 ) is caused by h@xmath70 collision - induced emission .",
    "this instability is also weak and probably unimportant .",
    "it is important to stress that , even if the fragments are nearly spherical , fragmentation will be modest and is likely to result only in a low multiplicity stellar system . as the density increases , quasi - static contraction takes place ( @xmath72 ) until the fragments become optically thick to lines , @xmath73 , and adiabatically collapse to increasingly higher central densities and temperatures . at this stage , @xmath74 and a central hydro - static core ( stellar core , filled circle in fig .  1 , upper panel ) is formed , with mass @xmath75 ( omukai & nishi 1998 ) .",
    "we stress again that , as long as the gas is metal - free , these sequence of events and conclusions hold independent of the halo virial temperature , for popiiis as well as for ly@xmath26-cooling halos . in fig .",
    "2 we show the evolution with temperature of the ionization fraction and of the fraction of molecular hydrogen for typical ly@xmath26-cooling halos of mass @xmath76 at three different redshifts , @xmath77 . we find that the evolution of these fractions is independent of the mass ( or , equivalently , @xmath52 ) and virialization redshift .",
    "molecule formation in the post - shock flow which follows the virialization of the gas within a dark matter halo has been recently investigated by uehara & inutsuka ( 2000 ) .",
    "if the gas is fully ionized , molecules form through non - equilibrium recombination , leading to overall fractions that are much higher than in the expanding homogeneous universe . as a consequence of enhanced and hd fractions",
    ", the gas rapidly cools to well below @xmath78 and fragments .",
    "molecular chemistry is important also for star formation in halos with @xmath79  k as assessed by susa ( 1998 ) and oh & haiman ( 2001 ) .",
    "they find that initial atomic line cooling leaves a large residual free electron density which allows molecule formation up to a universal fraction of @xmath80 .",
    "the newly formed molecules cool the gas further to @xmath81  k and the gas fragments on mass scales of a few @xmath82 .",
    "once the critical density for ( @xmath83 or @xmath84 for hd , if this is assumed to be the main coolant ) has been reached , lte conditions for the level populations disfavor further cooling and fragmentation . at this stage , fragments have masses comparable to the jeans mass corresponding to the point @xmath85 and virialize , following the evolution described above .",
    "therefore , independent of the initial virial temperature , fragments are formed with typical masses @xmath86 .",
    "each fragment is characterized by a central core of @xmath87 surrounded by a large envelope of gravitationally unstable gas .",
    "the core grows in mass due to gas accretion from the envelope .",
    "the mass of the formed stars depends on the accretion rate as well as on the fragment mass ( larson 1999 ) . in the absence of metals , radiation pressure can not counter - balance mass accretion onto the core ( ripamonti 2001 , omukai & inutsuka 2001 ) and the mass of the resulting star is comparable to that of the original fragment , @xmath88 .",
    "we will return to this crucial issue in section [ sec : accr ] .",
    "of course , if the parent cloud is rotating , angular momentum , if not dissipated , might prevent the collapse of the entire cloud . however , for the arguments relevant to the present paper , it is sufficient that the overall efficiency is of a few % thus yielding a few hundreds solar mass stars out of the @xmath89 fragments predicted by fig .  1 .",
    "the question that needs to be addressed now is what mechanism can finally lead to the transition to a conventional mode of star formation , to a standard imf , and what are the necessary conditions for this to occur .",
    "we now consider the effects of the presence of heavy elements on the fragmentation process .",
    "the discussion presented in this section is based on the analysis by omukai ( 2000 ) ( see the original paper for details ) .",
    "1 , reproduced from omukai ( 2000 ) , shows the effects of metal enrichment on the @xmath54 tracks for the same initial conditions and different values of the mean metallicity",
    ".    in general , clouds with lower metallicity tend to be warmer because of their lower radiative cooling ability .",
    "as long as the clouds are transparent , cooling and fragmentation occur .",
    "clouds with a mean metallicity @xmath90 follow the same evolution as that of the gas with primordial composition in the @xmath54 plane .",
    "however , at @xmath91 , formation on grain surfaces enhances cooling at low density .",
    "dust grains are well known to condense out the ejecta of sne ( see todini & ferrara 2001 and references therein ) . when the lte - nlte transition occurs for , the cloud can still cool ( though less efficiently ) due to oi line cooling . at densities @xmath92 , heating due",
    "to formation becomes larger than compressional work , i.e. @xmath93 and the temperature starts to increase until thermal emission from grains due to energy transfer between gas and dust dominates the cooling .",
    "this occurs at a density @xmath94 , where the temperature drops to @xmath95 and a new fragmentation phase occurs .",
    "this shows up in the lower panel of fig .  1 as the large dip in the @xmath40 evolution .",
    "the minimum fragment mass is reached at the point indicated by the empty circle , when the density is @xmath96 and the corresponding jeans mass is of order @xmath97 . finally , as the density increases",
    ", the gas becomes opaque to dust thermal emission , fragmentation stops and compressional heating causes the fragments to contract adiabatically ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "therefore , a critical metallicity of @xmath99 can be identified , which marks the transition point between metal - free and metal - rich gas evolution .",
    "when the metallicity is @xmath100 , at density @xmath101 cooling is driven by oi , ci and co line emission .",
    "when the nlte - lte transition for the level populations of co occurs , fragmentation stops and the temperature increases due to formation . the larger concentration of dust grains ( assumed here to be proportional to the mean metallicity ) leads to a significant thermal emission which is responsible for cooling the gas and starting a new phase of fragmentation .",
    "this stops when @xmath102 and thereafter the fragments contract quasi - statically until they become optically opaque to dust emission and adiabatic contraction occurs . due to the enhanced ability to cool , fragmentation stops at lower temperatures and densities for higher metallicity clouds ( see open circles in the lower panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "however , the jeans mass corresponding to the minimum fragmentation scale is always @xmath103 for the metallicity range @xmath104 , several orders of magnitude smaller than for a cloud with no metals .    at the onset of adiabatic contraction , when @xmath40 becomes larger than 4/3 , an initial hydro - static core forms ( transient core ) with a mass @xmath105 regardless of the metallicity of the gas .",
    "this transient core is fully molecular and is absent when the gas is metal - free .",
    "the temperature of the transient core increases as its mass increases due to accretion of surrounding gas . eventually , the temperature reaches about @xmath106 , where h@xmath70 dissociation begins .",
    "this softens the equation of state until the dissociation is almost complete .",
    "then , @xmath40 falls below 4/3 in the density range @xmath107 .",
    "note that the thermal evolution after h@xmath70 dissociation ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) is the same independent of the initial composition of the gas .",
    "after @xmath40 once again exceeds 4/3 , a hydro - static core ( so - called stellar core ) forms .",
    "its physical characteristics are independent of metallicity ( @xmath109 ; omukai 2000 ) .",
    "proto - stars , whose mass is initially very low ( about @xmath87 ) , grow in mass by accretion of the envelope material .",
    "the final mass of stars is , then , determined not only by the mass of the fragments , but also by when accretion stops .",
    "the accretion rate onto the proto - star is related to the sound speed ( and therefore , temperature ) of the proto - stellar cloud by the relation , @xmath110 , ( stahler , shu , & taam 1980 ) .    as seen in fig .  1",
    ", the temperature of proto - stellar clouds decreases with metallicity .",
    "therefore , the mass accretion rate is higher for proto - stars formed from lower metallicity gas .",
    "if dust is present in the accretion flow , accretion onto the massive proto - star becomes increasingly difficult owing to the radiation pressure onto the dust .",
    "in present - day interstellar gas , accretion onto stars more massive than @xmath111 is inhibited by this mechanism ( wolfire & cassinelli 1987 ) . in gas with lower metallicity , the mass bound is expected to be higher because of the higher accretion rate and lower radiation force . in particular , for metal - free gas , this mechanism does not work .",
    "therefore , without dust , accretion is likely to continue until the ambient gas supply is exhausted ( ripamonti 2001 , omukai & inutsuka 2001 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the presence of metals not only enables fragmentation down to smaller mass scales @xmath97 , but also breaks the one - to - one correspondence between the mass of the formed star and that of the parent fragment by halting the accretion through radiation force onto the dust .",
    "according to the scenario proposed above , the first stars that form within popiii and ly@xmath26-cooling halos out of gas of primordial composition tend to be very massive , with masses @xmath112 .",
    "it is only when metals change the composition of the gas that further fragmentation occurs producing stars with significantly lower masses .",
    "it is at this stage that we expect a transition to occur from a top - heavy imf towards a more conventional imf with a wide range of masses , such as the one observed locally ( scalo 1998 , kroupa 2001 ) .    a growing body of observational evidence points to an early top - heavy imf ( see hernandez & ferrara 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "compelling arguments for an early top - heavy imf can also be made from observations on various scales : _",
    "( i ) _ the early enrichment of our galaxy required to solve the so - called g - dwarf problem , _",
    "( ii ) _ the abundance patterns of metals in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , _ ( iii ) _ the energetics of the icm , _",
    "( iv ) _ the non - detection of metal - free stars , and _ ( v ) _ the over - production of low mass stars at the present epoch and metals at @xmath113 for the submillimeter derived star formation histories using scuba detections for a standard imf can be resolved with an early top - heavy imf .",
    "for instance , the icm metal abundances measured from chandra and xmm spectral data are higher than expected from the enrichment by standard imf sn yields in cluster galaxy members , which can be explained by a top - heavy early imf .",
    "furthermore , the observed abundance anomalies ( oxygen ) in the icm can be explained by an early generation of popiii sne ( loewenstein 2001 ) .",
    "there is observational evidence from the abundance ratio patterns of [ si / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] in the extremely metal - poor double - lined spectroscopic binary cs 22876 - 032 in the halo of our galaxy ( norris , beers & ryan 2000 ) for enrichment by a massive , zero - metallicity supernova on comparison with the theoretical models of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "these issues , highly suggestive of top - heavy early star formation , have recently motivated a series of numerical investigations of the nucleosynthesis and final fate of metal - free massive stars ( heger & woosley 2001 ; fryer , woosley & heger 2001 ; umeda & nomoto 2002 ) . in their recent paper , heger & woosley delineate three mass ranges characterized by distinct evolutionary paths :    1 .",
    "@xmath114 : the nuclear energy release from the collapse of stars in this mass range is insufficient to reverse the implosion . the final result is a very massive black hole ( vmbh ) locking up all heavy elements produced .",
    "@xmath115 : the mass regime of the pair - unstable supernovae ( ) .",
    "pre - collapse winds and pulsations result in little mass loss , the star implodes to a maximum temperature that depends on its mass and then explodes , leaving no remnant .",
    "the explosion expels metals into the surrounding ambient ism .",
    "@xmath116 : black hole formation is the most likely outcome , because either a successful outgoing shock fails to occur or the shock is so weak that the fall - back converts the neutron star remnant into a black hole ( fryer 1999 ) .    stars that form in the mass ranges ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) above fail to eject most of their heavy elements .",
    "if the first stars have masses in excess of @xmath117 ( in agreement with numerical findings ) , they invariably end their lives as vmbhs ( in the following we will refer to vmbhs as black holes of hundred solar mass or so ) and do not release any of their synthesized heavy elements .",
    "however - as we have shown - as long as the gas remains metal - free , the subsequent generations of stars will continue to be top - heavy .",
    "this _ star formation conundrum _ can be solved only if a fraction of the first generation of massive stars have masses @xmath118 . under such circumstances ,",
    "these will explode as and enrich the gas with heavy elements up to a mean metallicity of @xmath119 , and as per arguments outlined in the previous section ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", thereafter causing a shift over to an imf that is similar to the local one . in what follows , we further explore the implications of the above scenario and derive the conditions for the solution of the conundrum .      as a consequence of the picture proposed above , vmbhs",
    "are an inevitable outcome .",
    "we now compute the expected mass density of metals and the mass density of remnant vmbhs produced in such a first episode of star formation . for a collapsed dark matter halo of total mass @xmath19",
    ", the associated baryonic mass is assumed to be @xmath120 ( where @xmath121 is simply the baryon fraction ) . following the results of numerical simulations at different resolutions ( bromm 2001 , abel 2000 ) we assume that @xmath122 of the total available gas is utilized in star formation , the rest remaining in diffuse form .",
    "the relative mass fraction of and vmbh progenitors are parametrized as follows : @xmath123 where @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) is the total mass which ends up in ( vmbhs ) and @xmath126 is the mass processed into stars .",
    "thus , only a fraction @xmath127 of the formed stars can contribute to gas metal enrichment .",
    "the metal yields for the dominant elements have been computed using the results of heger & woosley ( 2001 ) , and are plotted in fig .  3 as a function of the mass of the progenitor star .",
    "the bulk of the yield is contributed by o@xmath128 and the mass of metals ejected can be written as m_z m_/2 - 10 , where we have taken @xmath129 as a fiducial mass for progenitors .",
    "next , the further assumption is made that metals are ejected from the parent galaxy into the igm and their cosmic volume filling factor is close to unity , therefore uniformly polluting the igm .",
    "this comes from the results of madau , ferrara & rees ( mfr , 2001 ) and mori , ferrara & madau ( 2001 ) , where it is shown that for reasonable values of the star formation efficiency , metal bubbles produced by ( standard snii in ) proto - galaxies which result from 2-@xmath130 peaks of the density power spectrum at redshift 10 do overlap .",
    "indeed , the kinetic energy released by is much higher than for ordinary snii ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , hence making our assumption even more solid .",
    "the temperature of the hot gas is expected to be somewhat higher than estimated by mfr : however , due to the higher redshifts and consequent stronger inverse compton cooling , ejected metals have enough time to cool by @xmath131 .",
    "as long as the average metallicity is below the critical value , @xmath132 , we argue that the imf remains top - heavy and the redshift - dependent critical density of metals contributed by all at redshifts @xmath133 can be computed , _ z ( z ) = _ z^dz_m_min(z ) + dmn(m , z)m_z where @xmath134 is the number density of halos per unit mass predicted by the press - schechter formalism and the integration is performed from @xmath135 which is the minimum mass that can cool within a hubble time at the specified formation redshift @xmath136 , @xmath137 ( see ciardi 2000 ) .",
    "we adopt a cosmological model with the following parameters to compute the abundance of halos : @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 ( latest predictions from bbn , see burles , nollett & turner 2001 ) and use the cobe - normalized power spectrum for fluctuations as described in efstathiou , bond & white ( 1992 ) .    from the above expression",
    ", we can estimate the transition redshift @xmath142 at which the mean metallicity is @xmath143 , = 10 ^ -4 z _ for various values of the fraction @xmath127 .",

    "the objective now is to set some limits on @xmath127 , the fraction of stars formed that result in providing the first metals , that are eventually responsible for the shift to a normal imf . in order to compare the predicted critical density of vmbh remnants to present observational data we need to make further assumptions about the fate of these vmbhs at late times .",
    "the mass density contributed by remnant supermassive black holes @xmath145 can be estimated observationally denotes the present day value ] from the demography of local galaxies ( magorrian et al . 1998 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) .",
    "there are two extreme possibilities ( bounding cases for the values of @xmath127 ) concerning the relation between the inferred mass density of smbhs and vmbhs :    [ a ] @xmath146 : all vmbhs have , during the course of galaxy mergers , in fact , been used to build up the smbhs detected today ;    [ b ] @xmath147 there is no relation between the detected smbhs and the early vmbhs , implying that smbhs have grown primarily by gas accretion .",
    "thus , in the first scenario [ a ] , we assume that all vmbhs are able to sink to the center of host systems to merge within a hubble time , giving birth to the smbhs in the nuclei of galaxies that we see today . note , that this is in fact unlikely ( as explained further below ) , nevertheless , this argument provides an extreme bound .",
    "it is important to point out here , that in the current proposed theoretical models for the mass accretion history of black holes , the mass density seen today locally in smbhs can be built either predominantly by mergers or by accretion . in phenomenological models that attempt to tie in the current high redshift observations of the space density and luminosity function of quasars with that of the local space density of black holes",
    "wherein it is assumed that quasars are _ ( i ) _ powered by bhs and _ ( ii ) _ are optically bright for a period of @xmath148 yr ( haiman & loeb 1998 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) , either picture ( mergers / accretion ) can adequately explain the mass assembly of the remnant smbhs .",
    "this permits both scenarios [ a ] ( wherein smbhs grow primarily via mergers of vmbhs during galaxy assembly ) and [ b ] ( wherein smbhs grow primarily by accretion and @xmath149 is unrelated to @xmath144 ) to be plausible extreme cases .",
    "consideration of cases [ a ] and [ b ] will provide bounds on the value for @xmath127 . for a given @xmath127 ,",
    "the corresponding value for the transition redshift can be found on the @xmath142 curve shown in fig  4 .",
    "we note here that vmbhs in the mass range expected from the first episode of metal - free star formation ( a few hundred solar masses ) are likely to be ubiquitous . using iso observations , gilmore & unavane ( 1998 )",
    "have convincingly argued that low mass stars ( in fact hydrogen burning stars of any mass ) do not provide a substantial portion of the dark matter inferred in the halos of galaxies . in combination with the mass limits obtained on potential dark matter candidates from the macho ( alcock 2001 ) and eros ( lasserre 2000 ) experiments ( micro - lensing studies ) in our galaxy ,",
    "low mass objects , with masses under @xmath150 are ruled out - thereby , making vmbhs ( @xmath3 bhs ) in halos ( case [ b ] ) plausible dark matter candidates .    for case",
    "[ a ] , we can simply equate @xmath151 to the measured mass density in smbhs found from the demography of nuclei of nearby galaxies ( magorrian 1998 ; gebhardt 2001 ) indicated by the horizontal line in fig .",
    "4 ( top panel ) .",
    "the most recent value reported by merritt & ferrarese ( 2001 ) is @xmath152 , which for @xmath153 and @xmath154 yields @xmath155 . from the top panel of fig .  4",
    ", we see that this gives @xmath156 .",
    "the corresponding value for the transition redshift can be found on the @xmath142 curve on the same plot , yielding a value @xmath157 .",
    "this constraint implies that all but a small fraction of the mass involved in the first episodes of star formation - approximately 6% - went in objects outside the mass range @xmath158 , yielding remnant black holes with mass @xmath159 .",
    "the scenario corresponding to [ a ] therefore implies that @xmath142 , the transition redshift from top - heavy to normal imf occurred at @xmath160 18.5 .",
    "let us now look at the other extreme case [ b ] , wherein the assembled smbhs in galactic centers have formed primarily via accretion and are unrelated to vmbhs .",
    "this leads us to two further possibilities : ( i ) vmbhs would still be in the process of spiralling into the centers of galaxies due to dynamical friction but are unlikely to have reached the centers within a hubble time due to the dynamical friction time - scale being long ( madau & rees 2001 ) , or ( ii ) vmbhs contribute the entire baryonic dark matter in galactic halos .",
    "pursuing scenario ( i ) , therefore , at best some fraction of these vmbhs ( for instance , those in gas - rich regions of gas - rich systems ) might appear as off - center accreting sources that show up in the hard x - ray wave - band .",
    "such sources have indeed been detected both by rosat ( roberts & warwick 2000 ) and more recently by chandra in nearby galaxies ( m84 : jones 2001 ; ngc 720 : buote 2001 ) .    in a survey of archival rosat hri data to study the x - ray properties of the nuclei of 486",
    "optically selected bright nearby galaxies ( ho , fillipenko & sargent 1995 ) , roberts & warwick ( 2000 ) found a large number of off - center x - ray sources .",
    "the x - ray sources detected within the optical extent of these galaxies were classified either as nuclear or non - nuclear ( and therefore off - center ) depending on whether the source was positioned within 25 arcsec of the optical nucleus .",
    "they detect a nuclear source in over 70% of the galaxy sample and a total of a 142 off - center sources .",
    "roberts & warwick ( 2000 ) find that the non - nuclear sources follow a steep , near power - law x - ray luminosity distribution in the @xmath161 which leads to an @xmath162 ratio of = 1.1 10 ^ 39 ^ -1 ( 10 ^ 10 _ ) ^-1 .",
    "[ eq : averagelx ]    the median luminosity of the non - nuclear sources is found to be a factor of @xmath163 lower than that of the nuclear sources .",
    "however , they estimate the incidence rate of off - center sources with @xmath164 ( which corresponds to the eddington luminosity for a 1.4 solar mass neutron star ) to be @xmath165 galaxy . the existence of accreting vmbhs might also help explain the following observation . the far - ir excess detected with dirbe at 60 and 100 @xmath23 m has been tentatively interpreted as an extra - galactic background with integrated intensity of @xmath166 nw @xmath167 in the range @xmath168 m ( finkbeiner , davis & schlegel 2000 ) . the energy required to produce such a fir background could derive from a highly obscured population of accreting vmbhs at moderate redshifts ( for an alternative to this see explanation of scenario ( ii ) below ) .    in order to estimate the mass density contributed by these vmbhs",
    ", we can compare the mass in vmbhs to that of the smbh in a typical galaxy of luminosity say @xmath169 for case [ b ] .",
    "most of the vmbhs are likely to be en - route to galactic centers .",
    "note however , that not all the inspiralling vmbhs will be accreting and be x - ray bright : many of these could , in fact , be low radiative efficiency adafs ( advection dominated accretion flows ) , and therefore be too faint to be detected by rosat or chandra or not accreting at all if they do not happen to be in gas - rich regions of the galaxy .",
    "thus , using the following argument we can obtain a lower limit on the abundance of vmbhs .",
    "the mass of the central smbh hosted by a galaxy with a luminosity @xmath170 ( assumed to be the fiducial galaxy for these purposes ) in the b - band is given by ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) : @xmath171 where the mass - to - light ratio in the b - band is taken to be @xmath172 and the galaxy luminosity is essentially dominated by the bulge luminosity . hence , the mass of the central smbh is @xmath173 .",
    "now , we use the luminosity of the rosat off - center sources ( roberts & warwick 2000 ) and use the fact that they find @xmath160 0.7 off - center sources with luminosity @xmath174 per @xmath169 galaxy , to estimate the mass of vmbhs in the fiducial galaxy . if we assume that these vmbhs have a typical mass of @xmath175 , their eddington luminosity is , @xmath176 thus , vmbhs appear to be radiating at sub - eddington luminosities , the average rate ( given by eq .",
    "[ eq : averagelx ] ) being @xmath177 of the eddington value .",
    "this is consistent with the observed luminosities of the nuclear sources in the sample , which roberts & warwick ( 2000 ) find to be radiating at severely sub - eddington rates .",
    "therefore , we expect that the typical accreting vmbh mass in a @xmath169 galaxy to be about 210@xmath178 .",
    "little is known about the spatial distribution of such objects .",
    "how can we take into account the fact that only a fraction of the sources are likely to be accreting ?",
    "since the detected rosat off - center sources are within the optical radius of the galaxies , the number of non - accreting vmbhs in the halos of these galaxies can be large .",
    "one can obtain a simple estimate of this number by pursuing the following argument .",
    "assume that vmbhs , being collisionless particles , closely trace the dark matter ( which we take to obey a navarro , frenk & white [ nfw , 1997 ] profile ) and that the ratio of virial to optical radius is @xmath179 for a @xmath169 disk galaxy ( persic , salucci & stel , 1996 ) .",
    "these hypotheses require that we scale up the total mass in vmbhs by a factor of @xmath180 , which gives @xmath181 .",
    "now , the ratio @xmath182 is @xmath183 , implying that @xmath184 which in turn gives @xmath185 ( see dashed line in bottom panel of fig .  4 ) and @xmath186 .",
    "now we explore scenario ( ii ) of case [ b ] , the instance when vmbhs constitute the entire baryonic dark matter content of galaxy halos ( but do not contribute to the disk dark matter ) .",
    "it is important to point out here that cosmological nucleosynthesis arguments require both baryonic and non - baryonic dark matter ( pagel 1990 ) .",
    "essentially , this is due to the fact that the mass density contributed by baryons @xmath187 , is well in excess of @xmath188 , the contribution to the mass density by visible baryons .    using the luminosity dependent relation of visible to dark matter for spirals ( persic , salucci & stel , 1996 ) for a fiducial galaxy of @xmath189 we find , @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the visible mass and @xmath192 is the total dark matter mass , given as a sum of a baryonic and a non - baryonic component . the total baryonic mass is a fraction @xmath121 of the total mass of the system , @xmath193 from the two equations above and assuming a nfw density profile , we estimate that the total baryonic dark matter content as , @xmath194 moreover , 90% of this mass resides outside the optical radius and can be contributed by vmbhs : = = 2.1 10 ^ 3 , implying _",
    "vmbh = 2.110 ^ 3 _ smbh = 6.4 10 ^ -3 . incorporating this constraint into fig .",
    "4 ( bottom panel ) , we find @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "note that this scenario does not violate the constraint on the over - production of background light ( see carr 1998 ; bond , carr & hogan 1991 ; wright et al .",
    "in fact , some fraction of the observed near - ir dirbe excess could be produced by vmbhs . in a recent estimate of the cosmic background at 1.25 @xmath23 m and 2.2 @xmath23 m ( corresponding to the j and k bands respectively ) using 2mass and the dirbe results cambresy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , also find an excess ( significantly higher than the integrated galaxy counts in the j and k bands ) suggesting the contribution of other sources .",
    "pop iii stars and their vmbh remnants ( accreting at very high redshifts ) postulated here are likely candidates .    according to scenario [ b ] ,",
    "the average metal abundance at redshift @xmath197 should be @xmath132 , marking the transition from a top - heavy imf to a standard power - law imf .",
    "this does not necessarily violate the observed metal abundances in damped ly@xmath26 systems , @xmath198 , as it is yet not clear to what extent the igm metallicity is spatially uniform at these intermediate redshifts .",
    "therefore , scenario [ b ] is poorly constrained by the data , as the two options ( i ) and ( ii ) give large ranges for @xmath127 and @xmath142 : @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "consistently , scenario [ a ] gives a limit on @xmath127 and @xmath142 of @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "the actual data do not allow us at present to strongly constrain the above two quantities , but they provide interesting bounds on the proposed scenario .",
    "these ranges also have implications for the expected detection rate of sne beyond @xmath142 with future instruments like ngst ( marri , ferrara & pozzetti 2000 ) .",
    "we have proposed a scenario to solve a puzzling _ star formation conundrum _ : the first stars are now thought to be very massive and hence to lock their nucleosynthesis products into a remnant ( very massive ) black hole .",
    "this high - mass biased star formation mode continues as long as the gas remains metal - free . during this phase",
    ", metal enrichment can occur only if a fraction @xmath203 of the stars have mass in the window leading to pair - unstable sne ( @xmath204 ) which disperse their heavy elements into the surrounding gas .",
    "such metals enrich the gas up to @xmath205 , when a transition to efficient cooling - driven fragmentation producing @xmath2 clumps occurs at redshift @xmath142 .",
    "we argue that the remaining fraction of the first stars end up in @xmath206 vmbhs . by analyzing the evolutionary fate of such objects",
    ", we argue that [ a ] they could end up in the smbhs in the centers of galactic nuclei , [ b ] ( i ) could be en - route to the center and hence identified with the x - ray bright , off - center rosat sources , or ( ii ) constitute the entire baryonic dark matter content of galaxy halos .",
    "these possibilities are used to obtain constraints on the two quantities : @xmath207 and @xmath208 for [ a ] , and @xmath209 $ ] and @xmath210 $ ] for case [ b ] .",
    "the value @xmath211 found here is admittedly somewhat uncertain .",
    "for this reason we have investigated how the above results might be affected by a different choice , assuming @xmath212 . indeed ,",
    "lower values of @xmath213 imply that less efficient metal enrichment is required in order to change to a more conventional star formation mode .",
    "thus , comparable values for @xmath142 are found but the corresponding values for @xmath203 tend to be systematically smaller , being @xmath214 for scenario [ a ] and in the range @xmath215 for scenario [ b ] .",
    "several uncertainties remain in the comparison of the inferred density of vmbhs to local observations .",
    "for example , it is not obvious if smbhs could at all form out of vmbhs .",
    "dynamical friction can effectively drag vmbhs towards the center of the host system , at least within a distance of @xmath81  pc ( madau & rees 2001 ) . unless most of the energy is radiated away in gravitational waves",
    ", it could be difficult for a vmbh cluster to coalesce into a single unit .",
    "furthermore , accretion onto isolated vmbhs could be too inefficient to explain most of the off - center sources observed by rosat and chandra .",
    "higher accretion rates might be activated by the tidal capture / disruption of ordinary stars .",
    "question remains if the frequency of such an event is in fact sufficiently high to explain the data .    in spite of the many difficulties and uncertainties discussed above , our study represents a first attempt to link the first episode of cosmic star formation activity to present day observational evidence of their fossil remnants .    a top - heavy imf for the early episodes of star formation in the universe might have other interesting observational consequences",
    ", we speculate further on them below . the kinetic energy released during",
    "the thermonuclear explosions powered by pair instability are @xmath216 larger than those of ordinary type ii sne .",
    "this might cause the interaction with the circumstellar medium to be as strong as predicted for hypernovae ( woosley & weaver 1982 ) .",
    "however , these explosions do not lead to the ejection of strongly relativistic matter ( fryer , woosley & heger 2001 ) and therefore can not power a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) .    in popiii progenitors of vmbhs ,",
    "the estimated angular momentum is sufficient to delay black hole formation and the system might develop triaxial deformations ( fryer , woosley & heger 2001 ) . if the instabilities have enough time to grow , the core might break into smaller fragments that would then collapse and merge to form the central vmbh . if not , the star might still develop a bar - like configuration .",
    "both these scenarios lead to a significant emission of gravitational waves ( schneider 2000 ; fryer , holz & hughes 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , significant emission of gravitational radiation can occur as a result of the in - spiral and merger of vmbhs onto the smbhs in the center of host systems ( madau & rees , 2001 )    once the vmbhs have formed , accretion continues through a disk at a rate which can be as large as @xmath217 ( fryer , woosley & heger 2001 ) .",
    "magnetic fields might drive an energetic jet which can produce a strong gamma - ray burst through the interaction with surrounding gas .",
    "the properties of these popiii grbs would be considerably different from their more recent ( @xmath218 ) counterparts : depending on the uncertain interaction of the jet with the surrounding matter , the bursts would be probably longer [ @xmath219  s ] and the peak of emission , that in the rest frame is in @xmath40-rays , would be shifted into x - rays .",
    "indeed , bepposax has revealed the existence of a new class of events , the so - called x - ray flashes or x - ray rich grbs , which emit the bulk of their energy in x - rays ( piro , private communication ) .",
    "furthermore , since popiii grbs explode at very high redshifts , it is likely that their optical afterglow might be heavily absorbed by the intervening gas .",
    "these systems might be the natural candidates for the significant number ( about 40 % of grbs for which fast follow - up observations were carried out ) of grbs which do not show an optical counterpart , the so - called ghost ( grb hiding optical source transient ) or dark grbs .",
    "other explanations ascribe the failed optical detection to dust extinction within the host system but the ultimate nature of ghosts is still very debated ( lazzati , covino & ghisellini , 2001 ; djorgovski 2001 )    finally , the energetic jets generated by grbs engines produce , by photon - meson interaction , a burst of tev neutrinos while propagating in the stellar envelope ( mszros & waxman 2001 ) .",
    "we investigate this aspect in a companion paper ( schneider , guetta & ferrara 2002 ) where we use the constraints set by the amanda - b10 experiment on the total integrated flux of tev neutrinos from popiii grbs .",
