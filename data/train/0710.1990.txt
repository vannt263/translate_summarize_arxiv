    "mirror symmetry for calabi - yau @xmath7-folds is a subject of great interest to physicists as well as mathematicians @xcite@xcite .",
    "mirror pairs were first exhibited @xcite by studying orbifolds of the quintic at the gepner point @xcite in the calabi - yau moduli space .",
    "this was explored in more detail in @xcite which contained the first mathematical predictions from mirror symmetry .",
    "many generalizations were found using the landau - ginzburg formulation that were applicable in non - geometric regimes @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to extend the study of mirror symmetry to non - compact gepner models .",
    "various approaches towards this problem have been followed .",
    "toric calabi - yau manifolds have been very well studied in the literature following the construction of mirror pairs for hypersurfaces in toric varieties @xcite and for non - compact calabi - yau manifolds ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the physics literature , this has been reformulated using a gauged linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "progress has also been made for more general @xmath8 theories via conformal field theory techniques @xcite .",
    "in particular , the work on t - duality for the @xmath9 cigar and the liouville conformal field theories is relevant in this context @xcite .",
    "one of the gaps we aim to fill in this paper is to clarify the link between non - compact gepner models and their landau - ginzburg description . for compact calabi - yau manifolds that are hypersurfaces in weighted projective space , the landau - ginzburg description",
    "is closely tied to the geometry @xcite .",
    "these are two of the many phases in a gauged linear sigma - model description @xcite .",
    "the landau - ginzburg model is also extremely useful for providing a simple setting to do computations .",
    "for instance , it has served well in the past for establishing the link between compact gepner models and compact calabi - yau manifolds @xcite as well as to provide the first list of calabi - yau hypersurfaces in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "our approach in this paper is to stress the ingredients of the analysis of gepner models that survive the transition from going from the compact to the non - compact case .",
    "we alo point out the characteristics that differ in the two cases",
    ". moreover we study in detail the orbifolded landau - ginzburg description of these models @xcite .",
    "this allows us to compare our models with geometric backgrounds which can be used as internal spaces for type ii strings on @xmath11 .",
    "in section [ noncompactgepner ] we will review the asymptotic partition function of non - compact gepner models @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic partition function , which is proportional to the divergent volume of space - time , otherwise behaves much as the partition function in the compact case .",
    "in particular we show here that the @xmath12-method of gepner @xcite for constructing modular invariants can be adapted to the non - compact case .",
    "we then start the discussion of the localized spectrum @xcite , which is characteristic of non - compact models .    in section [ lg ]",
    "we will link the non - compact gepner models to landau - ginzburg models .",
    "we briefly remark on the difference between the compact and non - compact landau - ginzburg model @xcite .",
    "for instance , the former gives rise to a unital chiral ring , while the latter gives rise to a ring without unit element .",
    "we continue the analysis in section [ orbifoldedlg ] with a discussion of the orbifolds of the landau - ginzburg models that are necessary to implement the gso projection , and other orbifold groups .",
    "we will see that the formalism for counting chiral ring elements largely carries over from the compact case @xcite",
    ". however , it will become intuitive that the landau - ginzburg potentials with negative powers exclude some of the ( anti-)chiral ring elements as the potential renders them non - normalizable . continuing",
    "the formal counting exercise will turn out to be useful nevertheless .",
    "it gives rise to a natural picture of mirror symmetry in conformal field theories , that is strongly reminiscent of its compact counterpart @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this point in section [ cftmirror ] .",
    "in section [ examples ] we provide new examples of mirror conformal field theories .",
    "the techniques developed to analyze orbifolded landau - ginzburg models come in handy when treating these more complicated models .",
    "the mirror pairs of conformal field theories are best understood as linear dilaton backgrounds with @xmath9 superconformal symmetry .",
    "these can be deformed or resolved , to give rise to perturbatively well - defined mirror string backgrounds",
    ". finally , in section [ geometrymirror ] , we discuss examples in which we can relate the mirror conformal field theories to geometries .",
    "it will turn out that we can approximate certain conformal field theories at large level with orbifold singularities that admit a toric description . at infinite level , we find agreement between the conformal field theory and the geometric results . at finite level , we find that the conformal field theory description takes into account various modifications to the background that can lift some moduli . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we discuss further applications of our results .",
    "we start out with a rather brief but technical review of non - compact gepner models ( see e.g. @xcite ) in order to clarify the fact that the asymptotic partition function of non - compact gepner models can be constructed using the same tools as in the compact case .",
    "we can then lay bare properties of the models along the same lines as in the compact gepner models .",
    "in the second part of this section we give a preview of the ingredients that go into analyzing the localized part of the partition function .      for simplicity we will work with type ii string theory on @xmath11 times an internal ( non - compact )",
    "conformal field theory of central charge nine .",
    "the internal conformal field theory is built from a product of @xmath9 superconformal field theories .",
    "these can be split into three classes depending on whether their central charge is smaller , larger than or equal to three .    *",
    "the minimal @xmath9 superconformal field theories ( see e.g. @xcite ) have central charge smaller than three .",
    "they can be viewed as coset conformal field theories of the form @xmath13 of central charge @xmath14 .",
    "the level @xmath15 is the supersymmetric level of the total @xmath16 current algebra present in the parent @xmath17 wess - zumino - witten model .",
    "it is a positive integer larger than or equal to two .",
    "+ since the minimal @xmath9 superconformal models have been reviewed frequently ( @xcite ) , and since they are standard in the construction of gepner models @xcite , we only very briefly recall some of their properties .",
    "the primaries of the model can be labeled by three quantum numbers : the spin @xmath18 under the @xmath19 current algebra , the @xmath20 valued chiral momentum @xmath21 under the @xmath22 current algebra and the @xmath23 valued chiral momentum @xmath24 labeling a representation of the @xmath25 current algebra .",
    "they satisfy the selection rule : @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "we moreover have an equivalence between the following representations : @xmath27 .",
    "the left - moving @xmath28 charge @xmath29 for a primary is equal to @xmath30 . *",
    "the second class of theories has central charge larger than three .",
    "an example in this class is an @xmath9 linear dilaton theory with a slope such that the central charge is equal to @xmath31 with positive and real values for the parameter @xmath32 . the superconformal algebra with central charge larger than three has continuous unitary representations which are conveniently labeled @xcite by a casimir @xmath33 where @xmath34 , by an integer momentum @xmath35 and a @xmath23 fermionic quantum number @xmath24 .",
    "the left - moving r - charge @xmath36 of a primary is @xmath37 .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for a detailed discussion . )",
    "* the @xmath9 superconformal algebra with @xmath38 is exceptional , and can be represented for instance by free scalars ( which can realize compact or non - compact target space directions ) .    in order to mimic the gepner construction",
    ", we will assume that in the case @xmath39 , the chiral algebra has some more structure ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for simplicity we will work under the assumption that the parameter @xmath32 is a positive integer @xcite . ] .",
    "we can then add to the chiral algebra the generator of spectral flow on the @xmath9 superconformal algebra by @xmath40 units .",
    "the characters of the extended @xmath9 superconformal algebra in the continuous representations are given by : @xmath41 it is crucial to us that the modular transformation properties of the characters hinge upon the presence of the @xmath42-functions at levels @xmath2 and @xmath32 .",
    "we observe that the characters of the @xmath9 minimal models at level @xmath15 transform as @xmath42-functions at levels @xmath2 and @xmath43 , while the extended characters of the @xmath9 models with central charge @xmath31 transform as @xmath42-functions at level @xmath2 and @xmath44 .",
    "we thus note a first important sign difference in the transformation rules of the characters .",
    "modular invariants in the continuous sector of the theory can be based on modular invariants of @xmath42-functions . for one @xmath22 current algebra at level @xmath15",
    "these are well - known to correspond to the divisors of @xmath15 via orbifolding of the diagonal modular invariant . for a product of @xmath42-functions ,",
    "the analysis is more complicated , but a large class of modular invariants can be constructed by taking products of modular invariants of the factors , and then orbifolding .    in order to write down the modular invariant partition functions , it is useful to introduce a charge lattice for the various @xmath45 current algebras in the theory .",
    "we introduce a vector of levels @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of minimal model factors , @xmath48 is the number of non - compact factors , while the number of fermionic levels equal to @xmath2 is @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , we work in light - cone gauge on @xmath11 such that there is one complex fermion associated to the flat space directions ( and there is one complex fermion per factor model ) .",
    "the charge lattice is periodic . in each direction ,",
    "the periodicity is twice the level . a point in the lattice",
    "is defined by a charge vector @xmath50 where we used the notation @xmath51 for the charge of the flat space fermions under the @xmath25 current algebra , and similarly for the other fermions , while we copy the traditional notation for the chiral momentum quantum numbers of compact and non - compact factors that we introduced above ( including their normalization ) .",
    "the scalar product on the charge lattice is defined as follows : @xmath52 the contribution of the chiral momenta corresponding to the non - compact factors comes with an opposite sign from those of the compact factors .",
    "the all - important signature of the quadratic form is therefore @xmath53 .",
    "we introduce the following vector @xmath54 in the charge lattice charge is given for instance for a minimal model factor by @xmath55 . ] : @xmath56 we have that the left - moving r - charge @xmath57 for a primary state with charge vector @xmath58 is equal to @xmath59 .",
    "we moreover have that @xmath60 where we used that the total central charge of the light - cone gauge conformal field theory is equal to 12 = 3(1+p+q ) - _ i=1^p + _ j=1^q . in summary ,",
    "the vector @xmath54 is useful to measure the r - charge , and squares to minus one .",
    "for the right - movers we will always take identical conventions to the left - movers . in particular , the @xmath9 superconformal algebras have the same structure constants .",
    "we will also define the right - moving r - charge of the minimal model factors to be @xmath61 and for the non - compact factors @xmath62 , while the charge vector for the right - movers is @xmath63 .",
    "so , for the right - movers as well we have that the total @xmath28 charge is given by @xmath64 with the same vector @xmath54 .",
    "we define the following notation for the product of characters of the flat space fermions , the minimal model and the non - minimal @xmath9 superconformal field theories .",
    "since the characters transform like @xmath42-functions , we introduce the symbol : @xmath65 where @xmath58 is the total charge vector , and the first factor corresponds to the flat space fermions , while the following @xmath47 factors correspond to minimal model characters , and the final @xmath48 factors to the non - compact continuous extended characters . in the @xmath66 symbol we have left implicit the labels corresponding to the levels , as well as those corresponding to the casimirs of the minimal and non - minimal models .",
    "the important point is that the @xmath66-functions transform as a product of ordinary @xmath42-functions under modular transformations .",
    "we introduce now the first modular invariant partition function which is the diagonal modular invariant : @xmath67 where the diagonal sum over @xmath58 is over all inequivalent charges in the charge lattice .",
    "implicitly , we take a diagonal a - type modular invariant for the casimir invariants @xmath18 for all factors .",
    "we have suppressed the divergent non - compact volume factor in the formula for the asymptotic partition function .",
    "now that we have set - up our theory in a way which is very analogous to @xcite , we can follow that reference closely .",
    "along the way , we reformulate a few minor points in a more modern orbifold language .",
    "locality in string theory only allows for fermions having either neveu - schwarz ( ns ) or ramond ( r ) boundary conditions for all factors simultaneously for the left- or the right - movers .",
    "we implement that locality constraint by orbifolding the diagonal partition function by a diagonal @xmath68 group .",
    "the ith @xmath69 acts on a state with charge vectors @xmath58 and @xmath70 as @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "the action can be summarized by introducing vectors @xmath73 which have a @xmath2 as the first and the @xmath74th entry for @xmath72 .",
    "then the action can equivalently be written as @xmath75 . on an untwisted state with charges",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath76 , the action is the multiplication by a phase @xmath77",
    ".    the states invariant under @xmath68 will be purely ns or purely r for the left - movers .",
    "since the partition function was diagonal , the same condition will hold for the right - movers .",
    "the orbifold also introduces twisted states .",
    "these have left- and right - moving charge vectors that differ by multiples of the vectors @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "indeed , since the fermion number @xmath76 is defined modulo four , this introduces a twisted state sector for each @xmath69 orbifold factor , and moreover , since @xmath78 , we have that the twisted states we introduce in this fashion are also orbifold invariant @xcite .",
    "each of the @xmath69 orbifolds introduces twisted states , which renders the sum over left- and right - moving fermion numbers @xmath76 and @xmath79 independent , except for the fact that they need to be of the same parity as the flat space fermion numbers @xmath51 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "the above prescription is equivalent to the standard orbifold procedure and produces a new modular invariant partition function .",
    "note that the flat space fermion quantum numbers @xmath51 and @xmath80 are still of equal parity .",
    "we therefore only have nsns and rr states at this point .",
    "the sum over the left- and right - moving worldsheet fermion numbers @xmath51 and @xmath80 will become decoupled after performing a final @xmath69 gso projection , thus introducing fermions .      the standard gso projection in string theory",
    "is based on the fact that the partition function only has integer r - charges . in order to ensure this condition in a gepner model",
    ", we perform yet another orbifold",
    ". the orbifold action on a state with charge @xmath58 and @xmath70 will be @xmath81 .",
    "we first note that @xmath82 is an integer , such that the action of the orbifold on @xmath73 twisted sectors is identical to the action on @xmath73 untwisted sectors .",
    "the order of the @xmath83 orbifold is therefore the order of the operator @xmath84 in the untwisted theory ( where @xmath57 is the total left - moving r - charge in light - cone gauge ) .",
    "since @xmath85 , we still have the relation @xmath86 after the @xmath87 orbifold . ] .",
    "the order of that orbifold is the smallest common divisor @xmath88 of all the levels in the theory ( including the fermionic level @xmath2 when @xmath89 is even and not when @xmath89 is odd ) .",
    "it is clear in the untwisted sector that the orbifold forces the left - moving ( and right - moving ) @xmath28 charge to be integer .",
    "there are also @xmath90 twisted sectors which have charge vectors which differ by multiples of @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath92 , we have that these twisted sectors also have integer left- and right - moving r - charges .",
    "thus , the orbifold has provided us with a new modular invariant partition function with integer r - charges for both left- and right - movers .",
    "if we introduce the lattice @xmath93 generated by the vectors @xmath73 and @xmath83 , then we can write the partition function of the theory as in @xcite for compact gepner models . ] : @xmath94 where we restrict the sum to invariant states , namely states obeying the conditions @xmath95 ( purely ns or purely r ) and @xmath96 ( integer r - charges ) .",
    "again we have left implicit the diagonal a - type invariant for the minimal models as well as the diagonal integral over radial momenta for the compact factors that diverges like the volume of space - time .",
    "the partition function now has integer r - charges for all states , and can be gso projected in the same manner as the flat space partition function .",
    "we project onto odd r - charges , i.e. we satisfy the condition @xmath97 as well as @xmath98 .",
    "the charge difference between left- and right - movers for the twisted states is proportional to an odd multiple of @xmath54 .",
    "the twisted sectors are the ns - r and r - ns sectors of the theory , which correspond to space - time fermions , and contribute negatively to the space - time partition function thus implementing space - time statistics . for type",
    "ii theories , we have obtained an asymptotic supersymmetric partition function in the gepner formalism .",
    "strictly speaking we have a type iib partition function , since we have made no distinction between left- and right - movers .",
    "it can be transformed easily into a type iia partition function by flipping the chirality of the final gso projection for the right - movers in the r - sector .      in this subsection , we can follow @xcite closely since we have set up our model as in the compact case .",
    "it is interesting to single out a particular symmetry group of the model .",
    "the symmetry of the compact models contains a @xmath99 group .",
    "only the diagonal @xmath100 subgroup has a non - trivial action on a model with diagonal spectrum .",
    "this subgroup acts as _ r , exp(2 i ( n_i+_i)/ 2 k_i ) _ r , .",
    "we can introduce a vector _ i=(0, ... ,0;0, ... ,0,2,0, ... ,0 ; 0, ... ,0 ) where @xmath2 is in the @xmath101th entry after the first semi - column .",
    "the vector codes the action of the symmetry group as follows : _",
    "r , exp(i _ i ( r + ) ) _ r , .",
    "we have a similar action in the non - compact theories .",
    "there is a symmetry group @xmath102 , of which only the diagonal subgroup acts nontrivially on the states . in the full gepner model",
    ", we can think of the product of the diagonal subgroups d=_i=1^p _ k_i _ j=1^q _ l_j as mapped into the charge lattice via the maps @xmath103 .",
    "now we define the operator @xmath104 that acts by multiplication by @xmath105 .",
    "it generates a group @xmath106 , that we used previously to perform the integer r - charge orbifold .",
    "this orbifold group @xmath106 contains a subgroup generated by @xmath107 , which is a subgroup of @xmath108 .",
    "indeed , the element @xmath107 corresponds to a @xmath12-vector that has zero fermionic entries .",
    "when the order @xmath88 of the group @xmath106 is even , the subgroup generated by @xmath107 has order @xmath109 and it has order @xmath110 when @xmath88 is odd ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the part of the diagonal symmetry group @xmath108 that still acts after the projection onto integer r - charges is g=(_i=1^p _ k_i _",
    "j=1^q _ l_j)/_n .",
    "following @xcite we then define the maximal subgroup @xmath111 of @xmath112 which preserves supersymmetry in space - time .",
    "this is the subgroup corresponding to all vectors @xmath113 in the charge lattice that satisfy the equation @xmath114 .",
    "this condition ensures that the left- and right- moving r - charges only differ by even integers , as required by supersymmetry .",
    "if we write _ m = _ i c_m^i _ i , then this condition boils down to the condition that @xcite + . the subgroup @xmath111 generated by the vectors @xmath113 that satisfy this condition is the maximal orbifold group consistent with space - time supersymmetry .",
    "any subgroup @xmath115 of @xmath111 can be used to generate new supersymmetric orbifold models .",
    "precisely as in the compact case , modding out the original model by the maximal subgroup @xmath111 generates the mirror model ( in the conformal field theory sense ) .",
    "moreover , orbifolding by a subgroup @xmath115 will generate a model that is mirror to the orbifold of the original model by @xmath116 .",
    "this was argued in @xcite for the compact case , and we will show in section [ cftmirror ] that it is also true for the non - compact models . note that the mirror symmetry in the conformal field theory that we have set up above holds for _ undeformed _ models .",
    "we will see that deformations of a model are mapped to resolutions of the mirror .",
    "we will discuss this important point in greater detail later on .",
    "until now we have discussed only the continuous part of the spectrum of the non - compact gepner models .",
    "the contribution of these states to the partition function is proportional to the volume of the target space .    a good starting point for the rest of our discussion will be to think of the initial model as based on a product of @xmath9 superconformal minimal models and @xmath9 linear dilaton theories .",
    "it is important to observe that although the exact torus partition function exists for these conformal field theories , they only describe the asymptotic spectrum of the corresponding string theory . indeed , there is a region in space - time that is strongly coupled ( due to the linearly growing dilaton in one or several directions ) . in that region ,",
    "the one - loop spectrum is not a meaningful quantity .",
    "nevertheless , we can get a handle on possible deformations of that singular string theory by working under the following hypotheses .",
    "we look for local deformations in the strongly coupled region deep in the throat(s ) .",
    "secondly , we focus on marginal deformations of the worldsheet theory that preserve supersymmetry in space - time . the @xmath9 superconformal algebra on the worldsheet will be preserved , and the deformations will be based on chiral ( or anti - chiral ) primaries .",
    "morever , we suppose that the deformations can not have @xmath28 quantum numbers that differ from those already appearing in the asymptotic partition function , namely , the charges are quantized as in the asymptotic partition function .",
    "we believe all of these are mild assumptions , given space - time supersymmetry .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite @xcite for similar reasonings , mostly from a space - time perspective . )",
    "using the fact that there is a map between @xmath9 superconformal algebra representations and reprentations of @xmath117 @xcite , we can reformulate the above conditions as saying that the marginal operators in the full theory should be based on chiral primaries of dimension smaller or equal to one half in the linear dilaton factors .",
    "the operator in the linear dilaton factor should have a conformal dimension equal to @xmath118 where the @xmath28 charge is given by @xmath119 , and where @xmath120 is an allowed @xmath28 quantum number given the ( fixed ) asymptotic partition function .",
    "we get an upper cut - off : @xmath121 from the requirement of relevance on the worldsheet .",
    "moreover , we want to study operators that are normalizable at weak coupling .",
    "strict normalisability requires @xmath122 .",
    "in particular the value @xmath123 is excluded in the non - compact factors , since this would correspond to a non - normalizable operator for a conformal field theory with a non - compact target space . in summary ,",
    "the quantum number @xmath124 has to lie in the range @xmath125 .",
    "it should be noted that the operator with @xmath126 is on the border of being normalizable in the sense that it lies at the endpoint of a line of delta - function normalizable operators @xcite .",
    "it will play a special role in what follows , and we will call this type of operator almost - normalizable .",
    "we will flesh out the above analysis considerably in the following sections .",
    "one of our goals in this section is to obtain , in a simple manner , the chiral ring of localized operators in the non - compact gepner models we described in section [ noncompactgepner ] . for the compact case ,",
    "this is most carried out by associating a landau - ginzburg model to each of the factor conformal field theories .",
    "the underlying idea is that at low energies , the landau - ginzburg model flows to the conformal field theory that corresponds to the minimal model .",
    "furthermore , the gso projection that we discussed for the non - compact gepner models maps to an orbifold of the landau - ginzburg theory .",
    "therefore the techniques derived in @xcite to obtain the spectrum in the landau - ginzburg models and orbifolds thereof will be crucial for our analysis .    in this section and the next , we give a similar landau - ginzburg description of our non - compact gepner models .",
    "we will find that much of the technology used in the compact case can be used for the non - compact case as well .",
    "however there are subtle differences in reading off the spectrum , because some of the operators are not normalizable .      for @xmath9 superconformal minimal models ,",
    "the flow between landau - ginzburg and superconformal minimal models is well - studied @xcite and we merely give a brief reminder . a landau - ginzburg model with @xmath127 supersymmetry and a chiral superfield @xmath128 with superpotential [ simplelg ]",
    "w_mm = ^k flows in the infrared to an @xmath9 superconformal minimal model .",
    "the chiral ring of both models match one - to - one .",
    "the chiral unital ring of the landau - ginzburg model is @xmath129/\\partial_\\phi w$ ] which is linearly generated by the @xmath130 elements @xmath131 , which have ( both left- and right - moving ) r - charge equal to @xmath132 .",
    "these match one - to - one to the chiral - chiral primaries of the diagonal minimal model .",
    "further evidence for this identification of the landau - ginzburg model fixed point is provided by the matching of the elliptic genus of these models @xcite .",
    "the t - dual or mirror landau - ginzburg model based on an twisted chiral superfield @xcite flows to the anti - diagonal minimal model .",
    "this can be written as a @xmath133 orbifold of the model in equation .",
    "we will discuss such orbifolding methods to compute mirrors in later sections .",
    "we can summarize the chiral ring of the landau - ginzburg model by specifying a poincare polynomial which is the trace over the chiral - chiral ring weighted by the @xmath45 r - charges @xcite : @xmath134 in the ramond sector , this gives rise to a polynomial that keeps track of the r - charges of the ramond - ramond ground states : @xmath135 note that the charges fill out the range from @xmath136 to @xmath137 , and lie inside the interval @xmath138-\\half,+\\half[$ ] .",
    "see figure [ rgroundstatescomp ] .",
    "superconformal theory with central charge @xmath139.[rgroundstatescomp ] ]      now we want to discuss the link between the non - compact @xmath9 superconformal field theories and the ir fixed point of landau - ginzburg models with a superpotential of the form : @xmath140 where @xmath32 is a positive integer .",
    "this was introduced in @xcite and we would like to understand how far we can argue for a formal analogy with the compact case , and if possible borrow the techniques that have been extensively used in that context .",
    "see also @xcite for a more detailed analysis of the renormalization group flow with fixed asymptotics .",
    "the central charge of this theory with fixed asympotics is @xmath141 .",
    "it is natural to assume that the field @xmath128 can not take the value zero , and that moreover the point at infinity should remain a regular point .",
    "we can then associate to the model an operator ring @xmath142 $ ] which should again be divided by the ideal generated by the derivative of the superpotential .",

    "to the linear dilaton asymptotics , we add a deforming potential .",
    "so far we have studied simple landau - ginzburg theories ( and their direct product theories ) .",

    "our discussion of orbifolded landau - ginzburg models is mainly based on @xcite .",
    "the orbifolding can arise due to the gso projection in string theory , or due to a further geometric orbifolding of the resulting theory . in this section ,",
    "we start out by discussing the orbifold action as being independent of possible actions on flat space factors , following @xcite . we will comment on the relation to the full gso projection ( which also acts on the flat space factors ) in the appendix .",

    "in particular , those with @xmath28 charges @xmath173 will lead to massless fields in spacetime . in the case where the geometric approximation is valid",
    ", marginal @xmath152 states correspond to complex structure deformations , and marginal @xmath170 states to khler moduli .",
    "a crucial observation is that for the calabi - yau examples we consider in this paper , @xmath152 states are in one - to - one correspondence with ramond - ramond ground states @xcite .",
    "more precisely , a ramond - ramond ground state becomes a @xmath152 state under the action of half - unit left - right symmetric spectral flow .",
    "similarly , @xmath170 states are derived from ramond - ramond ground states by half - unit left - right antisymmetric spectral flow . it will prove a good strategy to work in the r - r sector rather than in the ns - ns sector .",
    "the procedure we will use is the following @xcite :    * first identify the unprojected ramond - ramond ground states in each twisted sector and compute their r - charge .",
    "* then flow these states to the ns - ns sector , and keep those that are invariant under the orbifold action .",
    "let us study the two steps of this procedure in greater detail .",

    "remember that @xmath167 is the phase that defines the action of @xmath166 on @xmath162 , and @xmath165 is the r - charge of @xmath162 .",
    "the arguments leading to the first line of these formulae are elaborate @xcite .",
    "we refer to that reference for details .",
    "note that it is natural to look for the ramond - ramond ground state in the @xmath166-twisted sector by twisting the left - movers half - way in one direction , and twisting the right - movers half - way in the other direction , due to the symmetry between left- and right - movers in the original theory .",
    "the subtraction of the integer part of the twist arises because of the fact that we can otherwise find a state with smaller r - charge , between @xmath157 and @xmath158 that will have lower conformal dimension .",
    "see also figures [ rgroundstatescomp ] and [ rgroundstatesnoncomp ] .",
    "furthermore , as argued in @xcite , the r - charges behave very much like fermion number , which is indeed lifted from @xmath157 in the compact sector , by the contribution of @xmath167 .",
    "the crucial difference with the compact sector is only that for the non - compact sector we need to keep in mind that @xmath167 is negative , and that therefore it is more natural to think of the state with fermion number or @xmath28 charge moving _ down _ to a charge just below @xmath158 .",

    "the second line in each of these formulae and arises from spectral flowing the untwisted factor ns - ns ground state to the r - r sector .",
    "note that the superfield living in an untwisted factor can be given a nonzero vev .",
    "this is not possible in the twisted factor , since a constant does not satisfy the twisted boundary conditions . in this way , other ramond - ramond ground states can be generated in the same sector .",
    "for example , if the @xmath101-th factor is untwisted , the state @xmath181 ( @xmath47 integer ) is another valid ramond - ramond ground state .",
    "it has left- and right - moving r - charge @xmath182 , where we took into account the contribution of @xmath183 . in a compact factor , @xmath47 is restricted to the bounds @xmath184 . in a non - compact factor ,",
    "strictly normalizable states have @xmath185 , and almost - normalizable states have @xmath186 .",
    "these bounds follow from our discussion in section [ lg ] .",
    "the upshot is that the formulas [ twistedrchargeleft ] and [ twistedrchargeright ] , derived in @xcite for compact models , are also valid for non - compact models .",
    "once this hurdle is ovecome , one can extend the reasoning of @xcite to cover the non - compact case as well .",

    "the particular ramond - ramond ground state we discussed earlier had charges @xmath188 .",
    "it is the state one gets by half - unit spectral flow of the ns - ns vacuum .",
    "all the superfields are untwisted , and can be given constant values .",
    "the relevant poincar polynomial is simply the product of the poincar polynomials of each factors .      in this way we can enumerate all the ramond - ramond ground states , and",
    "their r - charges",
    ". then we can generate all the ns - ns ( anti-)chiral states , by spectral flow .",
    "we obtain @xmath152 states by symmetric half - unit spectral flow .",
    "their r - charges are easily computed from those of the ramond - ramond ground state : we add @xmath189 to the r - charges of the ground state . this operation does not change the twist : @xmath166-twisted ramond - ramond ground states flow to @xmath166-twisted @xmath152 states .    in a similar way",
    ", we get @xmath170 states by anti - symmetric half - unit spectral flow .",
    "this time , the ramond - ramond ground state r - charges are shifted by @xmath190 . note that anti - symmetric spectral flow changes the twist @xcite such that @xmath166-twisted ramond - ramond ground states flow to @xmath191-twisted @xmath170 states .    among all these states ,",
    "we keep only those that are invariant under the orbifold action . in the case of the integer r - charge orbifold , the selection is easy : we keep the states that have integer r - charges .",
    "but in other cases , the procedure is harder .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a generic discussion of this projection .      for the twisted ramond - ramond ground states , we encounter a subtle point and this is the crucial difference between the compact and the non - compact case .",
    "when we twist a coordinate , and restrict to constant modes , the field is set to zero",
    ". this will not give rise to a normalizable state when the landau - ginzburg potential has a negative power , since the potential blows up at zero .",
    "although we could therefore immediately discard the states that have a non - compact twisted factor as not being contained in the normalizable spectrum , we advocate keeping an open mind ",
    "we will continue the investigation into these non - normalizable states , in view of the possibility that we can tune the coefficient of the negative power potential to zero , which will render these states normalizable .    strictly speaking",
    ", the models where we do take into account such twisted sector deformations should be thought of as existing in the well - defined linear dilaton conformal field theories ( which give rise to locally strongly coupled string theory backgrounds ) .",
    "we believe we provide ample justification for this procedure later on .",
    "in particular in section [ cftmirror ] we will find that these states are needed in the construction of mirror pairs of conformal field theories , by generalizing the greene - plesser prescription of finding mirrors by orbifolding .",
    "more precisely , states untwisted in the non - compact directions will be mapped in the mirror model to states twisted in the non - compact directions .    to summarize",
    ", the full set of chiral and anti - chiral ring elements of the landau - ginzburg orbifold , including those arising in both the untwisted and twisted sectors , is interpreted as the spectrum of the linear dilaton theory .",
    "the landau - ginzburg model is a complex structure deformation of this linear dilaton background .",
    "this deformation removes from the spectrum the rr states twisted in the non - compact directions and the de - singularized string background only contains purely untwisted states . as we will see later on , in the mirror model",
    ", the deformation is mapped to a resolution of the theory .",
    "the spectrum of the resolved theory will , instead , only contain the states twisted in the non - compact directions .",
    "in this section we will apply what we have learned in the previous sections to some concrete models .",
    "we supplement the analysis of the asymptotic partition function of section [ asymptotic ] with an analysis of the localized states ( which we briefly touched upon in section [ local ] ) .",
    "we start out with some observations on the nature of non - compact gepner models , and how they differ from their compact counterparts .",
    "we will then compute the allowed deformations of @xmath152 and @xmath170 type in particular examples , in the language of orbifolded landau - ginzburg models . in the conformal field theory language , the conditions to be satisfied for chiral primaries have been written out in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "we compare our results with the conformal field theory formalism in appendix [ cftanalysis ] .",
    "we start out with some comments that allow us to single out some particularly interesting models .",
    "compact gepner models have factors with a central charge which is always smaller than three .",
    "a large level limit for all factors necessarily increases the central charge of the gepner model , and therefore is not consistent with the criticality condition for string theory .",
    "thus , compact gepner models are necessarily at large curvature ( and small volume ) .",
    "non - compact gepner models are of a different type .",
    "in particular we can have non - compact gepner models that contain factor conformal field theories at central charge smaller _ and _ larger than three .",
    "we can therefore cancel off the difference in a large level limit , if we wish . assuming that we demand the existence of a limit in which all levels are large",
    ", we immediately conclude that such a non - compact gepner model necessarily has three factors ( since the total central charge is @xmath192 ) .",
    "there are two such classes of models ( if we do not admit models with central charge precisely equal to three ) .",
    "one is where we have two minimal model factors and one non - compact factor , and the other has one minimal model factor and two non - compact factors .",
    "there are no other possibilities at central charge @xmath8 .",
    "( when we consider a non - compact gepner model at central charge @xmath193 , with @xmath108 an integer different from @xmath194 , there are other possibilities which can also easily be classified . )",
    "the class of models with two minimal models can be parameterized by the integer levels @xmath195 and @xmath196 of the minimal models , up to an initial choice of ade modular invariant and a possible orbifold by a symmetry group .",
    "the level @xmath32 of the non - compact factor is then fixed to be @xmath197 which can be integer or fractional .    the other class of models is parameterized by two levels @xmath198 and @xmath199 for the non - compact models , and the combination @xmath200 then needs to be integer , in order for the compact model at level @xmath15 to exist .",
    "the levels @xmath201 can a priori be fractional or real . as we have indicated before , we concentrate on the case where all levels are integer .      *",
    "we note that a general class of models can be found by demanding @xmath202 to be integer ( with @xmath203 and @xmath196 positive integers ) .",
    "suppose we isolate the greatest common divisor @xmath88 of @xmath204 and @xmath205 ( with @xmath206 and @xmath207 mutually prime ) .",
    "then it can be shown that the level @xmath208 is integer if and only if @xmath88 is a divisor of @xmath209 . that easily generates a large class of models of which we will only study a few .",
    "* we note that although the local curvature would seem to become small in the large level limit , this reasoning does not take into account the gso orbifold that still needs to be performed . in specific examples",
    "it can be checked that the gso orbifold recreates small radii in the geometry ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "we can therefore generically expect the large level limit to correspond to an _ orbifolded _ weakly curved background .    in the following",
    "we will mainly concentrate on the set of models that have the special property of allowing for a large level limit ( although our formalism does apply more widely ) .",
    "we study in detail the set of models with three factors and levels @xmath210 or @xmath211 for the minimal model and non - compact factors respectively , and orbifolds thereof . as a warm - up exercise however , we treat the instructive example at complex dimension @xmath212 with the compact model at level @xmath15 and the non - compact model at the same level @xmath15 .",

    "thus , mirror symmetry applies to the deformed , regular theories as well .",
    "the main difference with the compact models is therefore that the mirror map includes the specification of the action of the mirror map on the deforming operator(s ) . naturally , the specification is that one changes the right - moving r - charge of the deforming operator to find the mirror deformation .",
    "the mirror map extends to subgroups of @xmath111 as in the compact case .",
    "we believe it is best to illustrate the above general framework in a few examples . in the following section",
    ", we will then revisit these examples and see to what extent we can interpret mirror symmetry of the conformal field theories in a geometric framework .",
    "we recall that compact gepner models at central charge @xmath217 lie in the moduli space of @xmath284 compactifications of string theory .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the mirror transform acts as an automorphism of the k3 moduli space and there are special points in the moduli space where there are fixed points . for our non - compact @xmath214 model at central charge @xmath217 , we see that in its singular guise , the particular @xmath285 deformations that we identified are indeed self - mirror .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ ale ] . changing the sign of the right - moving r - charge exchanges the two individual sets of @xmath233 deformation parameters that we distinguished previously .",
    "we note that this property of self - mirroring holds only for the singular model .     model",
    ". each dot corresponds to one chiral primary , identified by its non - compact left- and right - moving quantum numbers @xmath120 and @xmath286.[ale ] ]    as a consequence , we can discuss mirror symmetry for the weakly coupled deformed model .",
    "when we deform the @xmath214 model with a liouville potential ( consistent with sixteen supercharges ) , we are left with @xmath287 deformation parameters and a regular theory .",
    "it is mirror dual to the singular theory deformed by the winding potential ( which geometrically gives rise to the cigar theory ) .",
    "the latter theory also has @xmath233 deformation parameters , which can be mapped individually to their mirror images ( using their worldsheet r - charges for each factor of the model ) .      for compact gepner models at central charge @xmath8 ,",
    "mirror symmetry maps one model onto another , exchanging @xmath152 and @xmath172 states .",
    "we will illustrate that this is the case for non - compact gepner models as well .",
    "first we will treat a case in which we simply mod out by the maximal group , and thus obtain the mirror theory",
    ". then we will show that one can mod out by a subgroup of the maximal subgroup and obtain mirror pairs .",
    "we will thus provide large classes of mirror non - compact gepner models .",
    "we note that the @xmath211 model , which is modded out only by the gso @xmath20 group ( in the landau - ginzburg formulation ) has @xmath253 marginal @xmath152 deformations and @xmath130 marginal @xmath170 deformations , as discussed in section [ twocigars ] .",
    "orbifolds of this model were treated in section [ twocigarsorbifold ] .",
    "the maximal group that we can divide out by consistent with supersymmetry is the orbifold group when @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "then , substituting in the formulae for the massless moduli computed in that section , we get @xmath130 marginal @xmath152 deformations and @xmath253 marginal @xmath170 deformations .",
    "the orbifold indeed gives rise to the mirror theory .",
    "this is exactly analogous to the greene - plesser discussion of mirror conformal field theories associated to compact calabi - yau threefolds at a gepner point .",
    "we want to compare these models to those in the literature .",
    "the @xmath211 model modded out by the maximal group and deformed by the sum of liouville potentials corresponds to the non - compact calabi - yau studied in @xcite to geometrically engineer pure @xmath290 gauge theory .",
    "the orbifold group restricts all the possible @xmath152 deformations to the @xmath130 moduli studied in that paper which span the coulomb branch of the @xmath290 gauge theory . we will discuss the relation between our non - compact gepner model , the associated landau - ginzburg model and this geometry in more detail in the next section",
    "moreover , we find that this model is mirror to a model that has no orbifold except the gso projection , and deformed by the winding condensates in the two non - compact directions .",
    "that gives rise to the two - cigar model of @xcite , as argued in that reference .",
    "from our perspective , we see that the double cigar deformations disallow all @xmath253 marginal @xmath152 deformations in the unorbifolded model , and leaves only @xmath130 khler deformations . that matches precisely the analysis in @xcite .",
    "note that this gives a confirmation of our methodology : the counting in @xcite is based on the spectrum identified by considering a regularized partition function @xcite .",
    "thus we find that the regularized partition function agrees with our intuitive arguments which find their basis in the landau - ginzburg model with negative power potentials ( see sections [ lg ] and [ orbifoldedlg ] ) .    as an example of the power of our simple description",
    ", we note that the model with liouville deformations and no orbifold action is not directly related to the known models described in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we readily identify its mirror to be the orbifolded theory with cigar deformations in both the non - compact factors .",
    "it should be clear now that the examples in sections [ twommorbifold ] and [ twocigarsorbifold ] give rise to two infinite classes of mirror non - compact gepner models .",
    "we will illustrate this for one of the two classes since the other class behaves in almost every respect analogously .",
    "recall that the @xmath210 model allows for a maximal @xmath133 orbifold consistent with supersymmetry .",
    "when the level @xmath15 is a product of two positive integers @xmath291 , we can orbifold by a non - maximal subgroup @xmath292 which gives rise to a model which is mirror to a @xmath293 orbifold of the same model .",
    "indeed , the counting of @xmath294 marginal @xmath152 operators and @xmath295 marginal @xmath172 states in the first model ( the @xmath255 orbifold ) is precisely the mirror of the counting of the model with @xmath293 orbifold group , as can be seen by a exchanging the role of @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( see figure [ mirrorsymmetryfigure ] ) .",
    "thus , we have very simply but explicitly demonstrated the existence of an infinite number of mirror pairs of singular non - compact gepner models",
    ".    we note that the model @xmath211 can be treated analogously .",
    "the proof of the generic fact that models modded out by a subgroup @xmath115 of @xmath111 are mirror to models modded out by @xmath116 runs along very much the same lines as in the compact case @xcite , for the undeformed theory .",
    "for the deformed theory we need to remember that the mirror map will mirror the deformation as well",
    ".     models and its orbifolds by @xmath255 , with @xmath296 . ]",
    "in this section we want to discuss some geometric realizations of the mirror map that we identified in the non - compact gepner models above .",
    "we will see that we can identify various models with non - compact calabi - yau geometries , and approximate their mirror duals with abelian orbifolds of @xmath298 at large levels . at finite level , we find that the results of toric geometry acquire important modifications that lift certain moduli in our models .      in this model ,",
    "the space - time background has sixteen supercharges . in analogy with the compact case",
    ", we identify the calabi - yau manifold that corresponds to the landau - ginzburg model by writing down the superpotential ( augmented with the appropriate number of quadratic coordinates ) in the non - compact weighted projective space @xmath299 : w_1^k + w_2 ^ 2 + w_3 ^ 2 + c w_4 ^ -k = 0 .",
    "the constant @xmath243 ( multiplied by the coefficient of the first monomial ) measures the strength of the liouville deformation . by scaling the @xmath300 valued coordinate @xmath301 to one , we recuperate the equation : @xmath302 which describes an ale space which is deformed by @xmath243 from its singular orbifold limit .",
    "we thus associate that geometry to the landau - ginzburg model , but we should keep in mind that this association is local , i.e. near the singularity .",
    "asymptotically the spaces differ .",
    "we will see an example of the consequences of this difference later on .",
    "the matching of the @xmath233 marginal deformations to the geometric moduli is well - known .",
    "the conformal field theory mirror to the above theory was argued to be the @xmath214 model with cigar deformation . in the appendix we recall , following @xcite , that after a single t - duality , this model is mapped to a configuration of ns5-branes spread on a circle in a transverse plane .",
    "moreover , using the explicit geometric description , it can be argued in great detail ( see the appendix ) that the ns5-branes spread on the circle map under that t - duality to an orbifold singularity of the type @xmath303 at the tip of the cigar and the center of the minimal model disc . in particular , we see that the @xmath133 orbifold that arises from the gso projection on the side of the cigar mirror conformal field theory acts _ geometrically _ on the cigar and minimal model coordinates close to the tip of the cigar and the center of the disc .",
    "one should contrast this geometric action to the lack of such an action in the mirror geometry .",
    "moreover , in this example , it becomes manifest that when the cigar / winding deformation is turned on in the singular theory , the deformation caps off the linear dilaton cylinder . as a consequence it gives rise to a ( geometric ) fixed point which allows for the localization of twisted sector states .",
    "that agrees with our prescription for keeping the @xmath233 twisted sector states when turning on the cigar deformation .",
    "note that there is a one - to - one match of the marginal supersymmetric deformations of the cigar times minimal model conformal field theory to the marginal supersymmetric deformations of the @xmath303 orbifold ( with @xmath304-field on the vanishing cycles ) @xcite .    in the strictly infinite level limit",
    ", the match is expected , since then the cigar and disc flatten out completely .",
    "the two models become identical in that limit . however , at finite level @xmath15 , the match is due to the rigidity of the sixteen supercharge construction , as will become clear when we discuss models with less supersymmetry .",
    "models with eight supercharges will show various new and interesting features .",
    "we will discuss two models in detail with increasing level of complexity .",
    "the model with levels @xmath211 and double liouville deformation has a singularity that is well - described by a hypersurface in the ( non - compact)weighted projective space of the form @xcite : @xmath305 where the two coordinates @xmath306 are @xmath300 valued .",
    "the deforming monomials are in one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath253 marginal @xmath152 deformations that we identified previously . after performing the @xmath307 orbifold , we find that only the complex structure deformations of the form @xmath308 for @xmath309 are invariant under the orbifold action . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "this is precisely the geometry discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the mirror conformal field theory and see whether we can count the number of khler deformations of the mirror theory using geometric means .",
    "the first observation we make is that , just as in the case with sixteen supercharges , there is an infinite level limit in which the model flattens out , up to an overall orbifold action .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix [ ns5 ] for the basic arguments in favour of such a description .",
    "in that ( strict ) limit , the model , locally , near the tips of the cigars and the center of the minimal model disc becomes equivalent to the orbifold @xmath310 .",
    "again , we use that on this side of the mirror symmetry , the gso projection acts geometrically and infer that the action of the @xmath20 on the three factors of @xmath298 is weighted as @xmath311 .",
    "this orbifold is toric and the number of khler deformations of the geometry can be counted using toric geometry techniques as follows .",
    "consider the supersymmetric orbifold @xmath312 , where the orbifold group of order @xmath313 is generated by : ( z_1,z_2 , z_3 ) ( ^a_1 z_1,^a_2 z_2 , ^a_3 z_3 ) _",

    "i=1^n g_i = 1 0g_i < 1 .",
    "the power of @xmath42 tells you in which twisted sector the modulus appears .",
    "before we proceed further let us also briefly recall how one draws the toric diagram corresponding to the non - compact orbifold .",
    "this will turn out to be useful to compare and contrast the spectrum of these non - compact toric orbifolds with the landau - ginzburg computation of the spectrum of moduli for the non - compact gepner models .",
    "given an action of @xmath317 on @xmath318 as above , we first find basis vectors @xmath319 that satisfy _",
    "i=1 ^ 3_i ( d_i)_a = 0 n .",
    "these three basis vectors generate the toric fan .",
    "one solution is @xmath320 .",
    "one can find two other linearly independent solutions to this equation .",
    "thus , neglecting the third coordinate of the vectors and plotting only the other two solutions to the above equation , one gets points on a plane . that this must be so follows from the calabi - yau condition .",
    "these points define the newton polyhedron corresponding to the non - compact calabi - yau .",
    "the basis vectors @xmath321 form a cone over the polyhedron which allows one to draw the toric diagram for the calabi - yau threefold in the plane .",
    "now , for each power of @xmath322 that satisfies the above two constraints ( i.e. for every khler deformation),we add another vector ( interior or boundary point in the toric diagram ) @xmath323 given by e_n = _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 g^(n)_i d_i .",
    "let us apply the above algorithm to compute the khler moduli and draw the toric diagram , for our case where @xmath324 ( i.e. @xmath325 ) and ( _ 1 , _ 2 , _ 3 ) = ( , , ) . one can check that there are @xmath15 khler deformations which arise from the twisted sectors @xmath326 .",
    "this is one more than the number of @xmath152 deformations we obtained from the landau - ginzburg computation in section [ twocigarsorbifold ] .",
    "let us draw the toric diagram corresponding to this orbifold .",
    "we choose a basis of vectors d_1 = ( 0,1,1 ) d_2 = ( 0,-1,1 ) d_3=(k,0,1 ) .",
    "we add @xmath15 points , corresponding to the @xmath15 khler deformations , which are elements in the @xmath172 ring , in the twisted sectors , whose coordinates are given by e_k=(0,0,1 ) , e_k+1 = ( 1,0,1 ) , e_k+2 = ( 2,0,1 ) , ",
    "e_2k-1 = ( k-1,0,1 ) .     for @xmath327 .",
    "note hat @xmath328 corresponds to a boundary point while all other added points lie in the interior of the newton polyhedron .",
    "we have also shown a possible triangulation of the polygon , corresponding to a particular resolution of the singularity.[toric ] ]    these points are plotted in figure [ toric ] . since @xmath329 in our @xmath20 orbifold it follows that this point will always be on the boundary of the toric diagram .",
    "when we compare the two calculations of the moduli , we see that the difference arises in the @xmath330st twisted sector of the gso orbifold , since , in the conformal field theory , we did not find a marginal khler deformation in this twisted sector .",
    "let us study in somewhat more detail how this difference comes about .",
    "it is well known that the points in the toric diagram can also be associated to exceptional divisors of the resolution of the orbifold .",
    "this is the twist - field - divisor map discussed in @xcite .",
    "the topology and intersection numbers of these divisors can be obtained in a straightforward manner by using the dual toric diagram .",
    "the boundary point corresponds to non - compact divisors and have the topology @xmath331 .",
    "therefore , the existence of the resolution corresponding to @xmath332 in the conformal field theory might seem surprising , given that the ( strictly ) normalizable deformations in the conformal field theory can be associated to compact cycles in the geometry .",
    "this can be understood as follows : the @xmath15th power of the orbifold action is trivial on one of the three complex directions in @xmath333 , and creates a singularity that stretches along a complex line in @xmath333 .",
    "the deformation is therefore akin to a khler deformation of a @xmath334 orbifold , embedded in @xmath298 .",
    "however , it is important to note that the @xmath335 direction that is left invariant in the @xmath15th twisted sector , is the direction that is compactified in the conformal field theory by the addition of the landau - ginzburg potential .",
    "so in the conformal field theory , all the exceptional divisors become compact . a second effect of the compactification",
    "is that only @xmath130 of the deformations are linearly independent .",
    "the landau - ginzburg counting of chiral primaries gives an easy method to understand which of the exceptional divisors are chosen as a basis in the conformal field theory .     with @xmath327 .",
    "we use the same alphabet to denote the point in the toric diagram and the divisor corresponding to it in the dual toric diagram . note",
    "that @xmath336 ( which is @xmath337 in our case ) is non - compact while all the other exceptional divisors are compact .",
    "[ dual ] ]    note that the @xmath172 deformation which is the identity operator in the minimal model , sets the volume of the compact factor and simultaneously the volume of the two - cycle at the @xmath338 singularity .",
    "the operator has charges @xmath339 and @xmath340 as can be seen from the landau - ginzburg model description , or appendix [ k2k2k ] .",
    "the toric abelian orbifold that is related to the @xmath210 model is the same as the one we discussed before .",
    "the differences with the previous model lie in the fact that we now compactify two coordinates , which reduces the number of khler moduli by two . by analyzing the spectrum of the conformal field theory as",
    "before , we find that in the toric diagram corresponding to the flat space orbifold , the twist fields associated to the divisors @xmath336 and @xmath341 are excluded in the conformal field theory",
    ".    however , we gain a khler modulus in the @xmath227th twisted sector which sets the overall volume of the two compact factors .",
    "it is the identity operator in the minimal model factors , and the winding operator in the cigar factor .",
    "it has charges @xmath342 and @xmath343 as can be seen from the landau - ginzburg description or from appendix [ 2k2kk ] .",
    "this is consistent with the picture developed in @xcite : the effective string coupling at the tip of the cigar sets the volume of the resolved cycles .",
    "note that in the previous example , we had a slight refinement of the picture developed in @xcite .",
    "namely , in the presence of the two non - compact directions , it is the modulus associated to the @xmath69 orbifold singularity at the tips of the cigars that sets the volume of the internal compact space .      in order to understand some more general features of the spectra of the conformal field theory and how they fit into the spectrum of the flat space orbifold approximation ,",
    "let us study the orbifold models studied in sections [ twommorbifold ] and [ twocigarsorbifold ] .",
    "the flat space approximation to the conformal field theory is given by a @xmath312 orbifold , generated by the elements @xmath344 using the algorithm discussed earlier , one can easily draw the toric diagram associated to this singularity as in figure [ orbtoric ] .     with @xmath345 and @xmath346 .",
    "[ orbtoric ] ]     orbifold of the @xmath211 conformal field theory for @xmath345 and @xmath346 are denoted by the filled dots .",
    "the unfilled dots show those points in the flat space approximation which are not included in the conformal field theory .",
    "[ orbthree ] ]     orbifold of the @xmath210 conformal field theory for @xmath345 and @xmath346 are denoted by the filled dots .",
    "the unfilled dots show those points in the flat space approximation which are not included in the conformal field theory .",
    "[ orbtwo ] ]    the spectrum of the exact conformal field theory has already been discussed in the main part of the paper . if we now plot the spectrum of the exact conformal field theory that corresponds to the @xmath211 model along the same lines , we get figure [ orbthree ] .",
    "we have shown which elements of the flat space approximation get lifted in going to the exact conformal field theory description .",
    "for this model the flat space approximation is identical to the one discussed above example , the canonical group element @xmath104 is given by the inverse of the one we have written here but the group generated and the orbifold of @xmath318 associated to it is unchanged . ] and it is drawn in figure [ orbtoric ] .",
    "the conformal field theory analysis is , however , different and the khler deformations which are kept are shown in the figure [ orbtwo ] .",
    "we mentioned before that in the toric diagram for the flat space orbifolds , the boundary points correspond to non - compact divisors .",
    "nevertheless as we saw in the simpler orbifold example , in the exact conformal field theory description , some of these directions are compactified .",
    "these directions are those along which a potential of the form @xmath347 , @xmath348 is turned on and which flow into a minimal model in the ir .",
    "however , the twist fields that correspond to divisors ( via the twist - field - divisor map ) which extend along directions that remain non - compact should be excluded in the conformal field theory as these do not lead to normalizable deformations .",
    "that this is so can be checked in our examples .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath210 model , in figure [ orbtwo ] , the excluded points on the boundary of the toric diagram correspond to khler deformations which are in the twisted sectors @xmath349 and @xmath350 , with @xmath351 .",
    "their respective @xmath45 charges are given by ( k_2,2k - k_2,0)(k+k_2,k - k_2,0)n\\{1 , ",
    ", k_1 - 1 } .",
    "as one can see , the twist fields are uncharged under the @xmath45 that acts on the non - compact direction and the divisors that correspond to these fields are non - compact .",
    "these are subsequently excluded from the conformal field theory spectrum .    however , further work is required to understand in full generality which states of the flat space orbifold are retained in a given conformal field theory of the type studied in this article .      the relation of the above orbifold approximations to ns5-brane set - ups has been discussed in the literature .",
    "these toric abelian orbifolds of @xmath333 can be mapped one - to - one to ns5-brane configurations that wrap holomorphic curves .",
    "the holomorphic curves can in turn be described by dimers that are systematically reconstructed from the abelian orbifold group . in the particular case above ,",
    "one obtains hexagon tilings of the plane with labelings determined by the weights of the gso projection and further orbifolding .",
    "they can be determined by straightforwardly generalizing the examples in @xcite .    in the sixteen supercharge case",
    ", one can show explicitly that the non - compact gepner model captures the near - horizon doubly scaled limit of the backreacted ns5-brane geometry ( as we have recalled in the appendix ) . in the case of eight supercharges , our non -",
    "compact gepner models capture a near - horizon doubly scaled limit of the backreaction of ns5-branes wrapped on the holomorphic curves coded by the dimer corresponding to our non - compact gepner model .",
    "we have shown that the gepner formalism for constructing modular invariant partition functions carries over to the asymptotic partition function of non - compact gepner models .",
    "the analogy was then further developed in a discussion of the symmetry groups of the gepner models , a classification of subgroups consistent with supersymmetry , and the discussion of how orbifolding by the maximal group can give rise to mirror models .",
    "secondly , we discussed the deep throat region of the non - compact gepner models and how to obtain the chiral primary states that are normalizable at weak coupling from the conformal field theory .",
    "we then discussed landau - ginzburg descriptions of both compact and non - compact gepner models and extended the existing techniques to analyze landau - ginzburg orbifolds such that they applied to the non - compact models under discussion .",
    "this led to an intuitive understanding of which modes become normalizable , and which modes are lifted by a momentum or winding potential .",
    "the counting of deformations becomes very tractable in the landau - ginzburg formalism . for completeness",
    ", we matched it onto a more intricate conformal field theory counting .",
    "we used these results to argue that mirror symmetry can be implemented in non - compact gepner models .",
    "when taking into account all possible deformations of the linear dilaton theory , it becomes analogous to the compact case .",
    "however , one always needs to keep in mind that the choice of deformation needs to be mirrored when discussing the deformed theories .",
    "as expected , we saw that in conformal field theory , mirror symmetry is implemented by a change in sign of the right - moving r - charge .",
    "the systematic treatment of symmetry groups allowed us to generate infinite classes of mirror pairs .",
    "indeed , in non - compact gepner models , one can cancel off positive and negative contributions to the central charges of the individual factors , thus allowing for infinite classes of models that also have a small curvature limit .",
    "in such small curvature limits , we argued that one recuperates flat space with an overall orbifold action .",
    "we identified such a limit , along with the orbifold , and showed that the conformal field theory matches with a flat space orbifold in the infinite level limit . at finite level",
    ", we identified subtle differences in the spectrum of the conformal field theory and the toric abelian orbifold singularity .",
    "it would be interesting to find a general rule that tells us , a priori , which modes of the toric orbifold are retained in the conformal field theory .",
    "there are a large number of future directions that one can pursue .",
    "for instance , one can generalize the landau - ginzburg models to models with fractional levels in the non - compact directions .",
    "one can also apply these conformal field theory techniques to describe the spectrum of chiral primaries and mirror theories for the heterotic string on non - compact landau - ginzburg orbifolds .",
    "another direction that we had in mind while embarking upon this investigation is the following .",
    "we have an orbifold approximation to particular non - compact gepner models . setting fractional or regular ( i.e. physical ) branes at such toric orbifold singularities",
    "is one way to engineer interesting quiver gauge theories .",
    "the toric data allows us to compute the superpotential on the brane at the orbifold singularity using techniques that are very well developed .",
    "extending these results to determine the worldvolume superpotentials for branes in non - compact gepner models would be extremely interesting as such results are not yet available using the exact boundary state description of d - branes in these models .",
    "furthermore , seiberg duality is well - understood in the context of the toric quiver gauge theories @xcite .",
    "we would like to study whether one can understand seiberg duality for d - branes in these almost toric spaces @xcite microscopically , as in @xcite .",
    "the fact that we have a microscopic description of the near - horizon doubly scaled limit of these backgrounds as well as a tunable level , should give us further computational control .",
    "we are grateful to agostino butti , eleonora dellaquila , bogdan florea , davide forcella , amihay hanany and ruben minasian for helpful conversations .",
    "our work was supported in part by the eu under the contract mrtn - ct-2004 - 005104 .",
    "in this appendix we relate the counting of marginal deformations that we performed in a landau - ginzburg language to a more elaborate enumeration of states in a standard conformal field theory formalism .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion and further examples .",
    "a state in the @xmath352 model ( restricted to the internal conformal field theory only ) is associated to the left and right charges @xmath353 @xmath354 as well as the compact spins @xmath355 and the non - compact spins @xmath356 .",
    "the spins are the same on the left and on the right , since we consider diagonal partition functions .",
    "the @xmath83-orbifold imposes integral r - charges , and allows the difference of left and right charges @xmath357 to be an even multiple of the gepner vector @xmath54 .",
    "the orbifolds @xmath73 that align the periodicities of the fermions allow additional even differences between the left fermion numbers @xmath76 and the right fermion numbers @xmath358 .",
    "chiral primary operators are chiral primaries in each conformal field theory factor . from unitarity of the non - compact gepner models ( see appendix [ unitarity ] ) it follows that in each factor separately we satisfy the equation @xmath359 for chiral ( respectively anti - chiral ) primaries and similarly for the right - movers .",
    "marginality of the deformations implies that we need to satisfy the equations @xmath360    solving this set of equations is straightforward but tedious because of the equivalences that exist for the minimal model quantum numbers : @xmath361 the same kind of equivalences hold in the non - compact factor : @xmath362 that is one technical reason why the landau - ginzurg method is more efficient to count ( anti)chiral operators .",
    "however it is possible to perform the counting in each individual example that we treated in the bulk of the paper .",
    "we do this analysis example by example .      in the @xmath214 model ,",
    "the gepner vector is @xmath363 . looking for chiral primary operators",
    ", we find    * @xmath130 @xmath152 states in the untwisted sector with charges : @xmath364 * @xmath130 @xmath170 states in the first twisted sector : @xmath365 * 1 @xmath152 state in each @xmath219-twisted sector ( @xmath366 ) : @xmath367 * 1 @xmath170 state in each @xmath368-twisted sector ( @xmath366 ) : @xmath369    for each @xmath152 state we also find a @xmath171 state and each @xmath172 state is similarly paired with an @xmath170 state .",
    "it is straightforward to match all these states with the ones we found more fluently in the bulk of the paper with the landau - ginzburg methods .    for each state , described by its quantum numbers @xmath58 , @xmath70 , @xmath370 and @xmath371 , we can write the corresponding closed string vertex operator : v_r,^j_1,j_2 = v^j_1_n , s_1;,_1 v^j_2_2m , s_2;2,_2 . here",
    "@xmath372 is a vertex operator of quantum numbers @xmath373 in the minimal model , while @xmath374 is a vertex operator of quantum numbers @xmath375 in the noncompact factor .",
    "if we denote the asymptotic coordinates along the cylinder as @xmath376 and @xmath42 and the bosonized complex fermion by @xmath111 , we have the asympotic expression for the vertex operators ( see e.g. @xcite ) : v^j_2m , s;2 , = .",
    "let us briefly mention the subtlety that the @xmath54 vector of gepner is defined in principle in all factors of the models .",
    "the reason we can consider its action separately in the internal factors only without encountering further difficulties lies in the fact that we first of all only consider even multiples of @xmath54 , and that moreover an even multiple of @xmath54 is equivalent to the same vector with only non - zero internal entries , up to the vectors @xmath73 .",
    "that is true for all three - factor models we consider ( and it is therefore also true for the two - factor model when we incorporate two further flat directions ) .",
    "having dispensed of that subtlety in comparing the two methods , we can again find the marginal deformations directly in the non - compact gepner model :    * the @xmath253 untwisted @xmath152 states have quantum numbers : @xmath377 @xmath378 * the @xmath130 twisted @xmath170 states have quantum numbers : @xmath379 @xmath380 where @xmath219 labels the twisted sector in which these states live .",
    "the corresponding closed string vertex operators are given by v_r,^j_1,j_2,j_3 = v^j_1_n_1,s_1;_1,_1 v^j_2_n_2,s_2;_2,_2 v^j_3_2m , s_3;2,_3 .",
    "the marginal deformations are written as follows :    * the @xmath253 untwisted @xmath152 states have quantum numbers : @xmath382 @xmath383 * the @xmath130 twisted @xmath170 states have quantum numbers : @xmath384 @xmath385 where @xmath219 labels the twisted sectors as before .",
    "the corresponding closed string vertex operators are given by : v_r,^j_1,j_2,j_3 = v^j_1_n , s_1;,_1 v^j_2_2m_1,s_2;2_1,_2 v^j_3_2m_2,s_3;2_2,_3 .",
    "for the orbifold models as well , one can perform the tedious exercise , thus affirming that the landau - ginzburg formalism is indeed more efficient .",
    "there is an extra subtlety that we need to address for this model . from the conformal field theory point of view",
    ", it is easiest to ignore the quadratic landau - ginzburg model with a trivial infra - red fixed point , and to work with an even number of internal conformal field theory factors .",
    "it then follows that the vector @xmath386 in the full light - cone conformal field theory is not equivalent modulo the vectors @xmath73 to the vector @xmath387 which represents the @xmath104 action on the landau - ginzburg internal conformal field theory .",
    "yet , it can be show that the landau - ginzburg model does correctly count the conformal field theory chiral - chiral and chiral - anti - chiral states . since it is only the @xmath172 state in the @xmath7-twisted sector that is crucial to us in this example ,",
    "let us show how to identify that state in the conformal field theory .",
    "it corresponds to the state with charges @xmath388 on the left , as indicated by the landau - ginzburg model .",
    "the right - moving charges are computed by observing that we are in the @xmath7-twisted sector .",
    "we obtain the charge ( up to equivalences in the charge lattice ) @xmath389 ( and we remain diagonal in the non - compact quantum number @xmath390 ) . indeed , the state with these charges is in the spectrum of the theory .",
    "note that we had to adjust the precise identification of the state in the conformal field theory .",
    "this is typical of the model with an even number of factors .",
    "the final vertex operator is chiral and bosonic on the left , and anti - chiral and purely made of fermions on the right .",
    "in this appendix , we recall the relation of the @xmath391 coset model to the near - horizon geometry of a particular constellation of ns5-branes @xcite . it is useful to revisit this exercise because we will be able to explicitly identify the region of space - time in which the ns5-branes reside with the presence of a patch isomorphic to @xmath392 in the t - dual .",
    "this fact is used as an argument in section [ geometrymirror ] .",
    "we recall that the supergravity background generated by parallel ns5-branes stretching in the @xmath393-directions in the string frame is : @xmath394 where the harmonic function @xmath111 is determined by the positions of the ns5-branes @xmath395 : @xmath396 we concentrate on @xmath15 ns5-branes spread evenly on a topologically trivial circle of coordinate radius @xmath397 in the @xmath398 plane ( see figure [ planealf ] ) .",

    "\\phi \\wedge d \\psi \\ , \\label{tdualns5geom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective string coupling constant is @xmath407 we refer to @xcite for the detailed calculation .",
    "a first observation to make is that the ns5-branes are located at @xmath408 and @xmath409 .",
    "moreover , the fact that the coordinate radius of the ns5-brane ring has gone to zero , has been compensated by the fact that the harmonic function and radial metric component has blown up and in such a way that the interior of the ns5-brane ring still has a proper size of order @xmath410 .",
    "it is difficult to press together ns5-branes . that s an important aspect of the solution , since in the interior , near @xmath408 and @xmath411 , we simply find a portion of flat space .",
    "after t - duality in the angular direction @xmath412 around which the ns5-branes have been sprinkled , we found the t - dual geometry : @xmath413 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "e^{2 \\psi}&= & \\frac{g_\\textsc{eff}}{k } \\",
    "\\frac{1}{\\cosh^2 r \\",

    "the background is recognized as a vector @xmath133 orbifold of the product of coset conformal field theory geometries @xmath415 .",
    "we want to add a couple of remarks to the analysis in @xcite to which we refer the reader for further comments . in particular , we first note the singularity in both the metric and the dilaton at @xmath411 .",
    "the origin of this singularity is the fact that we have performed an angular t - duality with a fixed point . around the fixed point ,",
    "as we have pointed out , the original background behaves like flat space .",
    "thus , the t - dual behavior is recognized as the same type of singularity that one obtains in t - dualizing flat space in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "since the original theory was regular near the origin , we expect the t - dual theory to behave well at this point as well .    on the other hand , we observe that the region at @xmath416 and @xmath408 where the ns5-branes resides has locally become identical to a @xmath392 orbifold .",
    "thus , it is the orbifold singularity of order @xmath15 that codes the presence of the ns5-branes in the t - dual .",
    "we can make the above analysis more precise by performing the following mental exercise .",
    "cut out from the @xmath417 plane a little disc at the origin .",
    "topologically , the space transverse to the ns5-branes has become @xmath418 , with ns5-branes spread on the @xmath419 ( see figure [ planealf ] ) .",
    "when we neglect the localization of the ns5-branes on the circle , the configuration is t - dual to an alf space @xcite@xcite , which in the particular case where the ns5-branes coincide in @xmath420 develops a @xmath392 orbifold singularity .",
    "that reasoning is another version of the one above , which uses local fiberwise t - duality .",
    "localizing the ns5-branes in the original geometry on the circle is known to be equivalent to taking into account worldsheet instanton corrections for the alf space @xcite@xcite@xcite , and this equivalence is conjectured to be valid for the ns5-branes on a topologically trivial circle as well @xcite .",
    "we take away several facts from this analysis .",
    "firstly , the @xmath133 orbifold projection acting on the @xmath421 coset has fixed points and gives rise locally to a physical @xmath422 singularity that is t - dual to the presence of @xmath15 ns5-branes . and",
    "secondly , in the geometry of the coset conformal field theory , the @xmath133 gso projection acts geometrically on the cigar coordinates , and this in contrast to the fact that the gso projection in gepner models does not orbifold the coordinates of weighted projective space .",
    "we recalled the above detailed example because we will use these facts as arguments in section [ geometrymirror ] and they are particularly manifest in the above example .",
    "we list in this appendix a number of properties that hold in unitary modules of the @xmath9 superconformal algebra , irrespective of the value of the central charge ( and in particular also when the central charge is equal or greater than three ) .",
    "our conventions for the @xmath9 superconformal algebra coincide with those of @xcite .        1 .",
    "all states in the ns - sector with conformal dimension @xmath166 and r - charge @xmath57 satisfy the inequality @xmath423 @xcite .",
    "an ns - sector field of conformal dimension @xmath166 and r - charge @xmath57 is a chiral primary if and only if @xmath424 and anti - chiral if and only if @xmath425 @xcite .",
    "chiral primary fields satisfy the inequality @xmath426 @xcite .",

    "6 .   a chiral ring exists @xcite .",
    "note that we performed a non - trivial exercise .",
    "for instance , for conformal field theories with central charge @xmath139 , it is argued in @xcite that there always exist a chiral primary field in the conformal field theory with conformal dimension @xmath431 .",
    "that is a consequence of the existence of the unit operator in the theory ( combined with spectral flow ) . in other words",
    ", there is a normalizable @xmath147 invariant ground state in these conformal field theories .",
    "that is not a consequence of unitarity only , and it does _ not _ hold generically for unitary @xmath9 superconformal field theories .",
    "in fact , the situation is subtle .",
    "for instance there are examples of bulk @xmath9 superconformal field theories with central charge @xmath39 for which the unit operator does not exist when the conformal field theory is defined on a riemann surface without boundary , while it does exist for instance on the boundary of a disc with particular boundary conditions ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "it is due to these kind of subtleties that it is useful to have a ( partial ) list of properties that we can indiscriminantly use for unitary @xmath9 theories with any central charge .",
