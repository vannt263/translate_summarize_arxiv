    "it has been recently stated that the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) or its generalisation the dark energy ( de ) , manifests itself in the dynamics of the local universe ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , and @xcite @xcite ) . in these papers ,",
    "the coldness of the local hubble flow around the local group ( lg ) has been attributed to the existence de .",
    "this has been supported by @xcite who analysed a set of n - body simulations and concluded that indeed ._",
    ".. [their ] results provide new , independent evidence for the presence of dark energy on scales of a few megaparsecs_. these results , if correct , would have provided an independent corroboration to the de component whose existence is otherwise inferred from observations of distant objects and the early universe .",
    "these authors used the term local as describing the neighborhood of the lg out to a distance of a few mpc .",
    "much of the dynamical implications of the cosmological constant for the large scale structure were worked out by @xcite .",
    "the lg constitutes a quasi - linear object and therefore its dynamics can not be modeled by the linear theory or the spherical top - hat model .",
    "consequently , we have recently studied the local universe by means of constrained simulations ( css , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite and @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the unique feature of the css is that their initial conditions are generated as constrained realizations of gaussian random fields @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions are constrained by observational data and hence they are designed to reproduce the main gross features of the local large scale structure . as such they provide the optimal tool for studying the dynamics of the lg , being a given individual but not an atypical object .",
    "in particular the recent constrained flat @xmath0 dominated ( ) and open ( ocdm ) cold dark matter n - body simulations of @xcite were designed to study the local dynamics in cold dark matter cosmologies with and without a de component .",
    "these simulations are to be used here as a laboratory for thesting the hypothesis that the cold local hubble flow is a signature of dark energy .",
    "we are less interested here in the actual coldness of the flow and more in the possibility that the de affects the local flow .",
    "a thorough analysis of the issue of the coldness of the local flow is to be given elsewhere ( martinez - vaquero et al , in preparation ) . in",
    "what follows local is defined as the region contained in a sphere of radius @xmath2 mpc centred on the lg .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "a very brief review of the simulations of @xcite is presented in section [ sec : cs ] .",
    "the selection criteria for lg candidates are summarised in section [ sec : lg ] .",
    "the flow fields around the simulated lg candidates in the  and ocdm simulations are presented in section [ sec : hubble ] . in section [ sec : grav ] we compare the gravitational field around the lg candidates .",
    "a general discussion concludes the paper ( section [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "our css have already been used in @xcite and they are briefly summarised here . these are dark matter ( dm ) only simulations employing a periodic cubic computational box of @xmath3 on a side using @xmath4 particles .",
    "both models use the dimensionless hubble constant of @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 km / s / mpc ) , the power spectrum normalisation @xmath7 and the cosmological matter density of @xmath8 .",
    "the  model corresponds to a flat universe with @xmath9 while for the ocdm model @xmath10 .",
    "these cosmological parameters correspond to the so - called concordance model .",
    "we used the parallel treepm n - body code gadget2 ( @xcite , @xcite ) to run these simulations . for the pm part of the algorithm , we used a uniform grid of @xmath11 mesh points to estimate the long - range gravitational force by means of fft techniques .",
    "the gravitational smoothing used to compute the short - scale gravitational forces correspond to an equivalent plummer smoothing parameter of @xmath12 kpc comoving .",
    "the number of particles used in these simulations ( @xmath4 ) provides a very mild mass resolution ( @xmath13 per particle ) which corresponds to a minimal mass of the dm halos of @xmath14 , for objects resolved with more than 20 dark matter particles . at such a resolution",
    "the inner structure of the main halos of the lg - like objects can not be resolved , nor can the observed mass distribution of the lg nearby dwarfs be reconstructed .",
    "yet , the dynamics on the scale of a very few mpc is very well resolved .",
    "we set up initial conditions for these simulations in such a way that we can zoom in to any particular object with much more resolution .",
    "thus , we generate the random realizations of the density fluctuation field for a much larger number of particles ( up to @xmath15 ) . then , we substitute the fourier modes corresponding to the small wavenumber by those coming from the constrained @xmath4 density field and make the displacement fields according to the zeldovich approximation .",
    "thus , we can now resimulate any particular zone of the simulated volume with particles of variable masses , down to 4096 times smaller than the particle mass of the simulations used in this work .",
    "a comparison of the results of   @xmath4 simulation with that from the lg - like systems resimulated at @xmath15 resolution does not yield any significant differences in their hubble diagrams ( to be published ) .",
    "the algorithm of constrained realizations of gaussian random fields ( @xcite , @xcite ) has been used to set up the initial conditions .",
    "the data used to constrain the initial conditions of the simulations is made of two kinds .",
    "the first data set is made of radial velocities of galaxies drawn from the mark iii @xcite , sbf @xcite and the @xcite catalogues .",
    "peculiar velocities are less affected by non - linear effects and are used as constraints as if they were linear quantities ( zaroubi , hoffman & dekel 1999 ) .",
    "this follows the css performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the other constraints are obtained from the catalog of nearby x - ray selected clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "given the virial parameters of a cluster and assuming the spherical top - hat model one can derive the linear overdensity of the cluster .",
    "the large scale structure , scales somewhat larger than @xmath16 , of the resulting density and velocity fields are strongly constrained by the imposed data .",
    "in particular all the resulting css are dominated by a local supercluster ( lsc ) - like object with a virgo size dm halo at its center .",
    "the lg is not directly imposed on the initial conditions , but having reconstructed the actual large scale structure of the local universe a lg - like structure is very likely to emerge in the right place with dynamical properties similar to the actual ones .",
    "the two simulations used here are based on the same random realization of the initial conditions .",
    "the selection of lg candidates is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the selection of the objects is based on the @xcite criteria , which consist of :    1 .",
    "the group contains two mw and m31 like dm halos with maximum circular velocity in the range of @xmath17 km / s .",
    "the two major dm halos are separated by no more than @xmath18 .",
    "the relative radial velocity of the two main halos is negative .",
    "4 .   there are no objects with maximum circular velocity higher than mw and m31 candidates within a distance of @xmath19 . 5 .",
    "the group resides within a distance of @xmath20 to @xmath21 from a virgo like halo of @xmath22 km / s .",
    "dm halos are found using both the bound density maxima algorithm ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the amiga halo finder ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the  simulation @xmath23 lg - like objects have been found and @xmath24 in the ocdm one .",
    "given the fact that both simulation are based on the same realization of the random gaussian field we have identified @xmath25 lg - like objects that appear in both simulations at about the same position and are very similar dynamically .",
    "we refer to these as the same objects appearing in both simulations .",
    "these same objects do not form any class by themselves and are statistically indistinguishable from the other lg - like objects .",
    "these objects are used here to exemplify the effect of the @xmath0 term on the dynamics of the lg , as they are the _ same _ object evolving in two identical cosmologies and environments that differ only by their @xmath0 term .    the fact that there is",
    "no one - to - one coincidence of the lg - like objects of the two simulations should not be surprising .",
    "there are two reasons for that .",
    "first , the two cosmologies are not identical and they differ in the linear gravitational growth function .",
    "second , the lg is a system in the quasi - linear regime and is far from being in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "had we observed it at a slightly different time it might not be qualified as a lg - like object according to the selection criteria assumed here .",
    "this is certainly the case for our simulated objects .",
    "just a small miss match in the dynamical phase of the objects between the two simulations can rule out an object in one or the other simulation from being a lg - like systems .    in the present paper we are interested in comparing the local hubble flow around lg - like objects .",
    "providing that the selected systems fulfil all requirements their exact location is not important for the purpose of the analysis .. therefore , we have used all the objects found within the computational box , regardless of their position with respect to the lsc .",
    "some simulated lg - like objects reside close to the actual position of the lg but they seem to be dynamically indistinguishable from the others .",
    "the local hubble flow around lg - like objects is probed by means of hubble diagrams showing the radial velocities relative to the objects center of mass within a distance of 3 mpc . in figs .",
    "[ fig : lcdm - hubb ] and [ fig : ocdm - hubb ] we present the hubble diagrams of @xmath26 randomly chosen candidates out of the @xmath25 lg - like objects which appear in both simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lcdm - hubb ] : , fig .",
    "[ fig : ocdm - hubb ] : ocdm ) .",
    "the figures present all the dm halos around the chosen lg - like objects out to a distance of 3 mpc .",
    "a careful comparison of the plots reveals that the hubble diagrams of a given  and ocdm simulated lg are very similar .",
    "in particular the _ r.m.s .",
    "_ value of the scatter around a pure hubble flow ( @xmath27 , assuming the true value of the hubble constant of the simulation ) does not vary statistically between the  and ocdm cases . for the @xmath26 objects shown in figs 1 and 2 , we find @xmath28 and @xmath29 km / s for the  objects and @xmath30 and @xmath31 km / s in the ocdm case .",
    "the values of @xmath27 for the other 5 common candidates are @xmath32 and @xmath33 km / s for the objects in the   simulation and @xmath34 and @xmath35 km / s in the ocdm one .",
    "much of the theoretical expectations for the possible manifestation of the de in the local flow is based on the model proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the model essentially assumes that the local gravity field around the lg can be decomposed into the contribution of the lg , modeled as a point particle , and the contribution of the de : @xmath36 the zero gravity surface is defined by @xmath37 .",
    "the radius of the zero gravity surface , @xmath38 , plays a critical role in that simple model .",
    "a central prediction of the model is that the local hubble flow should not contain galaxies with radial velocities smaller than the escape velocity ( see the appendix ) , calculated under the assumption that the gravitational field is given by the point particle approximation @xcite .",
    "this prediction excludes galaxies residing within the lg itself , namely within @xmath39 mpc . to test the prediction the radial escape velocity profiles ( eq . [ eq : vesc ] )",
    "have been plotted in both figs .",
    "[ fig : lcdm - hubb ] and [ fig : ocdm - hubb ] as solid (  model ) and dashed ( ocdm model ) lines . from here on the term escape velocity refers to the one calculated under the assumption of the point particle approximation .",
    "inspection of the  hubble diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lcdm - hubb ] ) shows that indeed the prediction of @xcite is confirmed : only two lg - like groups have , within the range @xmath40 mpc , a very few halos each with a peculiar velocity smaller than the  escape velocity .",
    "however , this behaviour is reproduced by the ocdm lg - like objects equally well ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ocdm - hubb ] ) .    to increase the statistical significance of the hubble diagram analysis we have considered all the lg - like objects in the  and ocdm simulations .",
    "this is performed by plotting the radial velocities of all halos near the lg - like groups against their distance @xmath41 .",
    "again , the hubble diagram of all lg - like objects in both cosmologies looks very similar .",
    "in fact , the fraction of halos below the escape velocity is somewhat smaller in the ocdm objects than in the  ones .",
    "we conclude that the  escape velocity prediction is reproduced by the ocdm simulation .",
    "the paper focuses mainly on the possible role of the de in the dynamics of the lg .",
    "a thorough analysis of the coldness of the local flow will be given elsewhere ( martinez - vaquero et al , in preparation ) . here a very brief summary of the subject is given .",
    "the very local hubble flow has been recently studied by @xcite and their currently updated catalog of local peculiar velocities has been analyzed here ( i. karachentsev , private communication ) .",
    "table i presents the value of @xmath27 taken over all the dm halos ( simulations ) or galaxies ( data ) in the range of @xmath42 $ ] mpc and @xmath43 $ ] mpc of the karachentsev s data and of the   and the ocdm lg - like objects .",
    "the cumulative distribution of @xmath27 ( calculated over the range @xmath43 $ ] mpc ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] .",
    "the plot shows that more than half the lg - like objects in both models have a @xmath44 km / s .",
    "so , many objects have a flow as cold , or colder , as the actual lg . yet ,",
    "as was pointed by @xcite the real problem of the coldness lies with the relation between @xmath27 and the mean density around the objects .",
    "it follows that the local hubble flow around  and ocdm lg - like objects is essentially indistinguishable .",
    "this stands in clear contradiction with previous claims of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . also , both the   and ocdm lg - like groups obey equally well the escape velocity prediction of the flat -@xmath0 cosmology , as if they are not affected by the @xmath0 term .    . the value of @xmath27 ( in units of km / s ) of the lg , compiled from the karachentsev data , and of the  and ocdm lg - like objects combined together , in the manner of fig .",
    "[ fig : all - hubb ] .",
    "two distance cuts are used for calculating @xmath27 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : sigma - h ]",
    "to understand the possible reason for the discrepancies between the present results and the and the model predictions we have studied the nature of the local gravitational field .",
    "the prime motivation here is to check the validity of the @xcite model of the gravitational field ( eq .",
    "[ eq;g - ch ] ) , which corresponds to the full gravitational field expressed in physical , and not co - moving , coordinates .",
    "the relation between the peculiar gravity ( output of gadget ) and the physical one was derived by @xcite , but it is repeated here for the sake of completeness .",
    "the physical @xmath45 and comoving @xmath46 coordinates are related by : @xmath47 .",
    "the gravitational field equals the physical acceleration of an object @xmath48 .",
    "the gadget code provides an acceleration - like term defined as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the peculiar velocity , @xmath51 is hubble s constant and @xmath52 is the expansion scale factor .",
    "it follows that @xmath53 namely , the linear term corresponds to the unperturbed friedman solution and @xmath54 to the fluctuating component was omitted .",
    "however , this did not affect the result , as only the fluctuating term of @xmath55 was considered there . ] .",
    "the gravitational field is taken with respect to the lg reference frame .",
    "so that , one finally obtain : @xmath56 where @xmath41 is the distance from the center of mass of the lg .",
    "this is the field acting on each dark matter particle .",
    "the total acceleration of halos was computed by averaging this quantity over all particles belonging to each halo .",
    "the acceleration is scaled by @xmath57 mpc . in such scaling the unperturbed gravitational acceleration of a shell of radius @xmath58 mpc equals to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the cosmological deceleration parameter .    in figs . [",
    "fig : lcdm - g ] and [ fig : ocdm - g ] we compare the radial component of the exact ( in the sense of the simulations ) gravitational field with the @xcite model ( @xmath61 ) , as traced by the dm halos around the lg - like objects .",
    "only the fluctuating component of the gravitational field is shown in the figures , namely for the numerically exact field it is the radial component of @xmath54 and for the point particle approximation it is @xmath62 .",
    "we show all dm halos in the distance range of @xmath63 mpc from the same lg - like objects that were presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : lcdm - hubb ] and [ fig : ocdm - hubb ] .",
    "since dm halos closer that @xmath64 mpc are affected by the two - body dynamics of the lg , they are excluded here .",
    "[ fig : g - g ] shows the scatter plot of the gravitation field of all the lg - like objects of the  and ocdm simulations .",
    "the plots show that the numerically exact value of the radial component of @xmath54 and the point particle prediction ( @xmath65 ) are very poorly correlated .",
    "a linear regression analysis finds a correlation coefficient of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) and a slope of @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) for the  ( ocdm ) model .",
    "it is clear that the point particle model fails to reproduce the actual gravity field , and therefore it can not account for the dynamics of the lg .",
    "the most striking result of this paper is that the local hubble flow around lg - like objects in the ocdm model is almost indistinguishable from the  flow . to the extent that the models do differ it is the ocdm model that has somewhat colder hubble flow than the  one .",
    "it follows that the local flow is not affected by the de and does not manifest the present epoch dominance of the de",
    ".    one should not be surprised by the departure of the simulated local hubble flow from the prediction of the simple model proposed by @xcite .",
    "first , the actual gravitational field deviates considerably from the predicted one .",
    "second , the gravitational dynamics is not local and the tidal field plays an important role in the quasi - linear regime ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that the dynamics depends not only on the local field , but is also affected by the shear , namely the tidal field .",
    "the shear breaks the simple linear relation of the density and velocity fields of the linear regime and therefore the local density field can not account for the local hubble flow .",
    "the comparison of the  and ocdm simulations shows that they yield very similar lg - like objects with virtually identical local hubble flows .",
    "it follows that the dynamical properties of lg - like objects and their environments , in the linear and quasi - linear regime , depend mostly on the cold matter content of the universe , namely @xmath70 , and only weakly on the de .",
    "this is another manifestation of the fact that the properties of the cosmic web , expressed in co - moving coordinates , depend mostly on @xmath70 and hardly on the de @xcite .",

    "we thank i. karachentsev for providing us his updated catalog of peculiar velocities of galaxies in the local volume .",
    "we thank deisa consortium for granting us computing time in the marenostrum supercomputer at bsc ( spain ) and the sgi - altix supercomputer at lrz ( germany ) through the extreme computing project ( deci ) simu - lu .",
    "we also thank nic jlich ( germany ) for the access to the ibm - regatta p690 + jump supercomputer and cesvima ( spain ) for access to the magerit ibm - bladeserver supercomputer .",

    "assuming the local gravitational field around the lg is indeed given by the point particle approximation ( eq . [ eq;g - ch ] ) , the effective newtonian potential is given by @xmath71 the effective newtonian energy ( per unit mass ) is simply given as @xmath72 . in the presence of the @xmath0 term the potential reaches a maximum at @xmath38 at which the potential peaks at @xmath73 .",
    "it follows that a particle is unbound to the lg if its energy is larger than @xmath74 .",
