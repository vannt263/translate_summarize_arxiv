    "this resembles a parabola with a single local minimum .",
    "the resulting transition path is shown as a black line and its relative maximum along this path ( around @xmath18 ) is an estimate of the transition free - energy barrier . instead",
    ", however , one may consider the projection along the droplet size  @xcite or equivalently along the energy , connected to the corresponding probability distributions @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we follow the latter approach and derive the free - energy barrier from the suppression of transition states in the canonical energy probability distributions ( see methods ) for both reaction coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "[ figillustration ]  ( c ) and ( e ) . demanding areas of equal size yields the equal - area inverse temperature @xmath27 , which is in fact identical to @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "we notice that the energy probability distributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related by a convolution involving the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath30 as ( see methods ) .",
    "this in turn corresponds to a physical smoothing , which diminishes the ratio between maxima and minimum . as a consequence",
    "we expect a lower barrier in the total - energy formulation due to the kinetic contribution .",
    "the free - energy barrier is commonly assumed to be proportional to the occurring interface . here the surface of the droplet @xmath31 separates the liquid droplet from the surrounding gas and consequently @xmath32 , with the interface tension @xmath33 .",
    "the surface should scale as @xmath34 .",
    "however , the droplet size itself at the condensation - evaporation transition does not scale trivially with system size . exploiting the equivalence to the ising model for equilibrium droplet formation at fixed temperature",
    "it was shown that directly at the finite - size transition density a single macroscopic droplet of size @xmath35 coexists with the surrounding vapor  @xcite .",
    "this result may be translated to a fixed - density setup using taylor expansions , where directly at the finite - size transition temperature the analogue scaling @xmath36 was verified for both lattice and off - lattice models  @xcite . introducing an effective interfacial free energy @xmath37",

    "@xcite directly as a linear function of the droplet surface .",
    "the advantage of the present approach is that it avoids difficulties and uncertainties coming from the `` correct '' identification of the nucleus interface .",

    "the evaluation of the free - energy barrier via equal areas provides us with a definition of the finite - size transition temperature . at fixed density , we showed in ref .",

    "the excellent fit results show that the empirical , yet physically motivated , higher - order corrections describe the finite - size scaling very well . in addition , the strong finite - size deviations open a possibility to study finite - size scaling in experiments on the nanoscale ( for a conversion see methods ) .",
    "the finite - size transition temperature of the largest system ( @xmath65 ) is @xmath66 , which still deviates from the thermodynamic limit by @xmath67 .",
    "it is worth noting that typical canonical finite - size transition temperatures , e.g. , the peak location of the specific heat , do not depend on the kinetic contribution to the partition function . in the canonical expectation values",
    ", the kinetic prefactor simply cancels . here",
    ", however , we observe a finite - size difference in the transition temperature depending on whether we consider the kinetic contribution or not .",
    "of course , the thermodynamic limit coincides .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figfsstemp ] with a finite - size scaling of the transition temperature difference @xmath68 .",
    "it shows a prominent power - law scaling of the form @xmath69 , which interestingly is the same scaling as the inverse transition droplet volume .",
    "the finite - size difference arises from the convolution of an asymmetric energy probability distribution with the asymmetric maxwell - boltzmann distribution , compare fig .",
    "[ figillustration ] and eq .  , which manifests in the geometric differences of the microcanonical inverse temperature and the enclosed areas in eq .  .",
    "it appears that correlations between the ensemble definitions account for compatible leading - order scaling corrections in eq .  , which further supports this ansatz and explains the observed difference .",
    "we have presented a shape - free approach to the estimation of canonical free - energy barriers in equilibrium droplet formation . the finite - size scaling is dominated by the predicted @xmath70 behaviour but we identified additional logarithmic corrections from precise numerical estimates . somewhat surprisingly , the absolute free - energy barrier is sensitive to the consideration of the kinetic contribution .",
    "it is well - known that the restriction to the conformational phase space does not influence finite - size transition points determined from canonical expectation values .",
    "these are evaluated on the level of the canonical partition function .",
    "the free - energy barrier and the associated equal - height or equal - area transition temperature , however , are determined from the energy probability distribution . here",
    ", the two formulations are related by a convolution with the maxwell - boltzmann distribution which explains the finite - size differences . at the same time , the probability distributions are the integrands of the respective partition functions . in the end , it boils down to the observation that equality of integrals does not imply equality of the integrands .",
    "this may become relevant once theoretical predictions and experimental measurements becomes precise enough .",
    "still , a restriction to the conformational phase space retains intensive parameters in the thermodynamic limit . as a numerical advantage , considering the total energy as reaction coordinate shows less fluctuations in the microcanonical partition function and canonical probability distribution , since the underlying convolution is a smoothing procedure of physical origin .",
    "it is expected that the energy remains a suitable reaction coordinate for general nucleation - like mechanisms . in this case",
    ", generalized - ensemble methods may unfold their full power .",
    "moreover , our approach at fixed density provides the possibility for experiments to perform heating - cooling studies in order to probe transition rates .",
    "this has potential application for temperature - driven self - assembly  @xcite , crystallization in so - called phase - change materials  @xcite and glassy solids  @xcite , cluster formation in protein solutions  @xcite and polymer aggregation  @xcite , dislocation nucleation  @xcite , or the study of surface nanobubbles and nanodroplets  @xcite .",
    "of course , experimental observations commonly include the formation of multiple clusters .",
    "reasons for this include impurities acting as nucleation seeds .",
    "we suppose that this leads to a local quasi - equilibrium on the respective length scales . here",
    ", a proper combination of the canonical droplet formation with the effect of nucleation seeds  @xcite seems to be a fruitful approach to a systematic understanding . with further developments , simulations may provide reliable estimates for finite - size systems and meet experiments on the nanometer scale .",
    "recently , there has been some ambiguity with the definition of a `` microcanonical ensemble '' in computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "this is a crucial aspect relevant for physical interpretations that appears to be unwittingly softened in the last decade .",
    "the _ microcanonical ensemble _ ( @xmath71 ) describes an isolated system in which the number of constituents @xmath72 , the volume @xmath73 , and the total energy @xmath8 are conserved . here",
    ", the transfer of potential energy @xmath9 into kinetic energy @xmath74 and vice versa is a valid and relevant mechanism , where @xmath75 .",
    "the microcanonical ( boltzmann ) entropy is defined as @xmath76 , with the partition function @xmath77)$ ] , where @xmath78 denotes the integration over state space and @xmath79 over momentum space .",
    "the other common definition is the _ conformational microcanonical ensemble _ ( @xmath80 ) , describing instead a system with fixed potential energy @xmath9 .",
    "the conformational microcanonical entropy is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the density of states or the conformational microcanonical partition function .",
    "the consequences are drastic : a ( physical ) interpretation of energy transfer from potential to kinetic energy is no longer valid .",
    "this is natural for spin systems , where a kinetic contribution is not defined in the first place ( but may be exploited for numerical purposes  @xcite ) . on the contrary",
    ", it is particularly relevant for situations in soft condensed matter , e.g. , for particles and polymers , where interpretations of energy transfer become natural .",
    "however , there are good reasons for this choice : @xmath83 is a fundamental property of statistical mechanics .",
    "it encodes the full information about the conformational space and allows for identification of ( structural ) phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it may be exploited for reweighting techniques and flat - histogram monte carlo methods  @xcite .",
    "the relation between @xmath84 and @xmath83 is given by a convolution with the kinetic - energy contribution  @xcite : if momenta and positions are independent one may separate the kinetic - energy contribution @xmath85 , explicitly perform the momentum integration , and obtain for @xmath72 particles in three dimensions  @xcite @xmath86 we define in order to extend the integral over the full energy range @xmath87 .",
    "in this way the total - energy - surface entropy @xmath88 appears as a ( weighted ) potential - energy - volume entropy .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , since all @xmath89 , the @xmath71 entropy increases with @xmath8 and the microcanonical inverse temperature can not become negative , opposed to its conformational counterpart .",
    "this may be an interesting aspect for a recent debate on the correct definition of entropy when connected with the phenomenological thermodynamic entropy , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the _ canonical ensemble _ is defined in terms of the partition function @xmath90 , where each phase - space point is weighted with the boltzmann factor according to the total energy .",
    "again , the kinetic part may be explicitly integrated for generic systems .",
    "each degree of freedom contributes with a gaussian integral , and one obtains for @xmath72 particles , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the partition function of the _ conformational canonical ensemble_. both partition functions may be expressed as integrals in terms of the respective energies , namely and .",
    "the corresponding canonical energy probability distributions are defined as and .",
    "we may now relate the two energy probability distributions by starting with the definition of @xmath28 and inserting eq .",
    ": @xmath93 we identify the latter part of the integrand as the @xmath72-particle maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath30 and may write eq .   as a convolution @xmath94 .",
    "we consider a system of lennard - jones particles in a dimensionless periodic box of length @xmath95 with fixed density .",
    "mutual avoidance and short - range attraction are modeled by the 12 - 6 lennard - jones potential with @xmath96 and @xmath97 . for computational efficiency , the potential is cutoff at @xmath98 and shifted by @xmath99 .",

    "<S> a common approach to study nucleation rates is the estimation of free - energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> this usually requires knowledge about the shape of the forming droplet , a task that becomes notoriously difficult in macromolecular setups starting with a proper definition of the cluster boundary or a proper ensemble choice . here , we demonstrate that a shape - free determination of temperature - driven droplet formation is directly accessible in the canonical ensemble . combined with rigorous results on canonical equilibrium droplet formation , </S>",
    "<S> this allows for a well - defined finite - size scaling analysis of the effective interfacial free energy at fixed density . </S>",
    "<S> we verify the theoretical predictions for the formulation of a liquid droplet in a supersaturated gas by generalized - ensemble monte carlo simulations of a lennard - jones system . because a standard approach in monte carlo simulations is to work in the conformational ensemble , </S>",
    "<S> we show that excluding the kinetic energy from the partition function leads to finite - size differences in the free energy but retains intensive parameters in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> our study of nucleation rates at fixed density corresponds to a heating - cooling framework where simulation and experiment may meet at the nanometer scale .    </S>",
    "<S> the formation of equilibrium droplets from a supersaturated gas is a long - standing subject of interest , being an essential phase transition in nature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the underlying mechanism is relevant for a multitude of nucleation - like processes from statistical mechanics to material science . these include crystallization in colloidal suspensions  @xcite , cluster formation in protein solutions  @xcite , as well as domain formation in so - called phase - change materials  @xcite and glassy solids  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is even connected to field theory  @xcite and nuclear reactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the formal framework of free - energy calculations is straightforward , e.g. , in terms of reaction coordinates in phase space , but the application in computer simulations is diverse with an ongoing demand for further methodological developments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a seminal application was the parameter - free estimate of crystal nucleation rates from equilibrium free - energy barriers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it seems natural that the estimation of nucleation barriers becomes increasingly difficult when considering more complex systems like polymer or protein solutions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of nucleation @xmath0 is related by classical nucleation theory  @xcite to the free - energy cost @xmath1 of a nucleus on top of the nucleation barrier : @xmath2 with the inverse temperature @xmath3 and the boltzmann constant @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic prefactor @xmath5 includes the kinetic details of the nucleation process , such as diffusion and nucleus - attachment rates . </S>",
    "<S> the free - energy barrier may be related to the suppression in the equilibrium probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> physically relevant barriers for liquid - vapor condensation are supposed to be in the range of @xmath6 to @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the typical setup for the study of free - energy barriers is at fixed temperature by variation of the density or degree of supersaturation , or directly in the grand - canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the barrier is then associated to the suppression in the droplet - size probability distribution  @xcite and is clearly temperature dependent  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this usually requires estimating the droplet size and interface , a task that introduces systematic uncertainties and strongly depends on the droplet definition . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the free - energy barrier may be directly related to the volume of the critical nucleus and the pressure difference  @xcite , exploiting a thorough understanding of the underlying phenomenon in a clever way . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , the problem can be reduced to conformational phase space , knowing that canonical expectation values typically do not depend on the kinetic energy .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we address the question of how to easily obtain dependable results on nucleation barriers without invoking elaborate thermodynamic reasoning or estimating nucleus shapes . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the door also to more complex systems with nucleation - like mechanisms such as self - assembly and aggregation . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we consider a setup at fixed density with varying temperature  an intuitive approach from a condensed matter perspective . </S>",
    "<S> analyzing a two - dimensional free - energy landscape , we identify the energy as a suitable reaction coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to formulate the problem in the microcanonical ensemble of either fixed total energy @xmath8 or fixed potential energy @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the usual textbook definition , while the latter has been frequently applied in recent computer simulation studies . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to directly discuss the effect of kinetic energy when changing between the two formulations @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> if kinetic energy matters , only the first one allows a direct physical interpretation . </S>"
