    "the number of strong gravitational lenses has grown tremendously in the last five years , with well over 40 examples of strong gravitational lenses produced by galaxies ( e.g.  keeton & kochanek 1996 and the castles webpage ) .",
    "when the separations are smaller than 30 , the lens galaxy has now been detected in all but one system : the small - separation , high - luminosity contrast lens q  1208 + 1011 .",
    "the lens galaxies have normal photometric properties and their mass - to - light ratios are typical of early - type galaxies embedded in dark matter halos ( kochanek et al .",
    "1999b , keeton et al .  1998 ) .",
    "for the 18 systems with separations larger than 30 and nearly identical redshifts ( see table 1 ) , a normal lens galaxy is detected in only four systems ( rxj  0911 + 0551 , q  0957 + 561 , he  11041805 and mg  2016 + 112 ) .",
    "no lens galaxy has been detected in any of the remaining 14 systems , with typical lower bounds on the mass - to - light ratio of the lens about 10 times higher than those measured for the normal lenses ( jackson et al.1998 ) . whether the _ quasar pairs _ with nearly identical redshifts separated by 30 to 100 are examples of `` dark '' gravitational lenses or binary quasars remains largely a mystery .",
    "proving either scenario has very interesting ramifications on the dark mass distribution in the universe , or the nature of interacting quasars ( schneider 1993 ) .",
    "there are about 2 such quasar pairs for every 1000 optically selected quasars ( hewett et al.1998 ) .",
    "kochanek , falco & muoz ( 1999a ) used a comparison of the optical and radio properties of the quasar pairs to show that the majority of the systems must be binary quasars .",
    "first , five pairs ( pks  1145071 , hs  1216 + 5032 , q  1343 + 2640 , mgc  2214 + 3550 and first  j1643 + 315 ) are `` o@xmath15r '' pairs in which only one of the quasars is a radio source and we can be certain that the system is a binary quasar .",
    "second , even though most of the known lenses were radio selected and the angular completeness of the radio lens surveys is better than that of the optical lens surveys , there is no example of a `` dark '' radio lens ( an `` o@xmath15r@xmath15 '' pair ) .",
    "these two facts are inconsistent with the dark lens hypothesis .",
    "quantitatively , kochanek et al.(1999a ) set a 2@xmath1 ( 1@xmath1 ) upper limit of 22% ( 8% ) on the fraction of the quasar pairs that could be gravitational lenses , the most likely scenario being that none is a gravitational lens .",
    "the high incidence and angular separations of the binary quasars can be quantitatively explained in terms of merger induced quasar activity ( kochanek et al .",
    "the enhancement of the quasar - quasar correlation function by a factor of @xmath16 on the angular scales of the pairs is exactly as predicted by the locally observed enhancement by a factor of @xmath17 in the quasar - galaxy correlation function on the same physical scales ( fisher et al .",
    "1996 , yee & green 1987 , french & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "the concentration of the pairs on scales smaller than 100 ( @xmath18  kpc ) is a natural consequence of the need for a close passage and tidal interactions to trigger renewed quasar activity .",
    "the absence of binaries on scales smaller than 30 is a natural consequence of the rapid increase in the orbital decay rate due to dynamical friction as the binaries shrink .",
    "these limits on the existence of dark lenses are , however , statistical .",
    "while the maximum likelihood solution is that there are no dark lenses , the statistical limit corresponds to allowing the existence of 3 dark lenses at the 2@xmath1 limit .",
    "the existence of even 3 dark lenses would mean that the densities of dark lens halos and normal clusters are the same on these mass scales ( maoz et al .",
    "1997 , kochanek et al .  1995 , wambsganss et al .  1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the binary hypothesis must somehow explain the remarkable similarity of the quasar pair spectra in the optical ( e.g. hawkins et al .",

    "they also found a number of absorption lines in the brighter component a , most notably the mg  ii doublet @xmath232796,2803 at @xmath10 , which perhaps hinted at the presence of a lens galaxy . when the emission line spectra of a and b were compared in detail",

    "the selection sample consists of `` simple '' systems where the strong lensing is believed to be caused predominantly by a single galaxy .",
    "some of the goals are : to place tighter constraints on the lens geometry ; to study the mass and light distribution of the lens galaxy ; to study the evolutionary history and environment of the lens galaxy ; to better constrain cosmological parameters through lens modeling and statistics , and finally , in some cases to discover the missing lens galaxy .",

    "q  1634 + 267 a and b are approximately centered in the nic2 field , and a star is visible at the edge of the @xmath29 field of view .",
    "the plate scales of the nicmos cameras changed as the ir array underwent thermal expansion .",
    "the variation was monitored ( cox et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the nic2 plate scales were 00760926 and 00754090 per pixel in the x and y directions , respectively for the measurement nearest the date of observation .",
    "the difference in the x and y plate scales is due to a small tilt of the ir array relative to the focal plane .",

    "( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) ; hence , we applied no extinction corrections to our photometric estimates .",
    "we fitted a point - spread function ( psf ) to our combined image , to determine the relative coordinates and the magnitudes of q  1634 + 267 a and b. because a and b are well separated , we derived a psf estimate from both components with the iraf daophot package .",
    "table 2 shows the resulting relative coordinates and h - band magnitudes of a , b and the star within our field of view .",
    "the quasar images are separated by 3852@xmath330.003 ; the brightness ratio a / b is @xmath34 .",

    "there is little hope that further radio observations can shed much light on these systems",
    ".      visual inspection of the images revealed no lens candidate near the expected position . to search for a faint lens that might be hidden by a or b",
    ", we fitted the psf derived in the previous section to the quasar components .",
    "we then subtracted the fitted psf from these components .",
    "the fainter one , b , was marginally broader than a. the difference might be caused by intrinsic psf differences at different positions on the detector , and similar small psf mismatches were seen in other nicmos archival images containing two or more stars .",
    "thus , we can not conclude that the slight broadening is due to a faint galaxy underneath quasar b. such a galaxy would have @xmath40 mag , which is too faint and at the wrong location to be able to produce lensed images with the observed splitting of @xmath41 .    to determine our detection limit for a lens galaxy , we generated circular galaxies with a de vaucouleurs profile and an effective radius corresponding to an @xmath42 galaxy ( @xmath43  kpc ) over the redshift range @xmath44 and for @xmath7 and @xmath8 cosmologies .",
    "we convolved the redshifted galaxies with the psf derived from a and b , and added them to our nic2 frame on a grid of positions within the frame .",
    "the resulting images were smoothed with a gaussian kernel with @xmath45 pixels , and inspected for signs of the added galaxies .",
    "we found a magnitude limit of @xmath46 ( @xmath36 ) for an early - type lens galaxy .",
    "for the sky background in our frame , the standard deviation of the noise level per pixel corresponds to a surface brightness of roughly 23.3 mag arcsec@xmath47 .",
    "we compute the expected mass to light ratio for a putative lens galaxy for q  1634 + 267 from our detection threshold .",
    "the anticipated mass of the lens can be derived from simple lens theory assuming it has a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) mass profile .",
    "the lens equation relates the angular coordinates @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) of the source ( images ) , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the deflection angle for an image at @xmath49 , with the lens galaxy at the center of coordinates .",
    "the sis assumption implies : @xmath52 , where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is the distance from the observer ( lens ) to the source ; @xmath55 is the observed angular separation of the lensed images , and @xmath56 is the velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy .",
    "therefore , using the observed image separation one can determine the velocity dispersion @xmath56 for a lens galaxy as a function of redshift .",
    "we show in figure 2a the velocity dispersion @xmath57 using cosmologies @xmath7 and 1 , and @xmath26 . for",
    "an a / b magnification ratio of @xmath58 , the lens galaxy should lie @xmath59 from image a along the a - b separation vector .",
    "we translate our magnitude limit of @xmath60 into an upper bound on the luminosity of the missing lens galaxy , placed at various redshifts .",
    "we follow the method implemented in keeton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to derive @xmath28band luminosity of elliptical galaxies at various redshifts using charlot & bruzual ( 1993 ) models .",
    "the models account for k - correction and passive evolution from formation redshift @xmath61 .",
    "coupled with the masses required to produce lensing , determined via the lens equations , the luminosity limits yield the mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) as a function of redshift , shown in figure 2b for cosmologies of @xmath7 and @xmath62 .",
    "the most likely ( comoving ) distance to the lens is half the distance from the observer to the source , where the galaxy has the largest cross section for multiply imaging a source . for q  1634",
    "+ 267 at redshift 1.961 the most probable lens location is therefore at redshift @xmath63 .",
    "an elliptical galaxy at @xmath64 would have @xmath65 in a low density universe , which is @xmath66 times higher than a normal lens galaxy ( keeton et al .",
    "1998 , jackson et al .  1998 ) , and 50 times higher than a limit placed by turner et al .",
    "( 1988 ) in the optical . therefore ,",
    "if obscuration is responsible for hiding a lens galaxy with a normal mass to light ratio from view , then the dust must cause at least 4 magnitudes of extinction in the @xmath28-band . if , however , we accept the mg  ii absorption lines as evidence for a lens galaxy at @xmath67 ( ss91 ) , then the detection limit of @xmath68 corresponds to about @xmath69 , or @xmath70 for an e / s0 type galaxy .",

    "( see for example , bender et al.1996 ) .",
    "it would have an extreme luminosity of @xmath91 if the scaling relation continued to hold .",
    "we conclude that the absolute lower limit on the mass - to - light ratio of the putative lens is @xmath92 for an early type galaxy at a redshift @xmath67 , and @xmath93 for an sb type at a redshift of @xmath94 .",

    "the observed @xmath28 band corresponds roughly to rest @xmath97 band ( @xmath98 ) or @xmath99 band ( @xmath100 ) . since @xmath101 mag for ellipticals at redshift 0.5 , and @xmath102 mag",
    ", the limit would be about 30 times higher for @xmath103 than for @xmath73 .",
    "if q  1634 + 267a , b is the split image of a single quasar , the lens must be a galaxy with an unprecedentedly high mass - to - light ratio .",
    "in fact , as we discuss in  4 , there are no galaxies above a detection limit of @xmath104 within @xmath105  kpc and no galaxies above a detection limit of @xmath106 within @xmath14  kpc of the quasars .",
    "thus the depth of the imaging also rules out any normal cluster of galaxies centered near the expected lens position .",
    "moreover , the limit on the optical @xmath107 of @xmath108 greatly exceeds even the usual estimates for groups and clusters of galaxies , where virial @xmath109@xmath110 ( e.g. , see carlberg et al.1996 , bahcall et al .  1995 , david et al .",

    "in our analysis we will adopt the narrow @xmath24 distribution from francis ( 1996 ) , as derived from 30 lbqs quasars .",
    "the francis ( 1996 ) distribution has a root - mean - squared ( rms ) width of @xmath137 , compared to @xmath138 for the broader distributions of francis et al .",

    "+ 267 the mean slopes are @xmath139 in the blue ( observed 31504734 ) and @xmath140 in the red ( observed 45806985 ) spectra respectively . in both the blue and the red ,",
    "the power law indices between a and b differ by @xmath141 .",
    "when comparing equivalent widths we must be careful to use identical measurement methods because of the difficulties introduced by line blending and continuum definition .",
    "francis ( 1993a ) showed that c  iv equivalent widths can vary by a factor of two depending on the measurement method , and thus broaden the distribution of equivalent widths by the same factor .",
    "for q  1634 + 267a , b we avoid these problems by using the same definitions followed by the lbqs ( francis 1993a ) . for this method ,",
    "continuum windows are defined on both sides of a given line .",
    "then the flux is summed above a line adjoining the continuum windows , over a region known as the line window .",
    "the continuum windows are chosen to exclude the flux contributed by nearby broad lines , so the line fluxes should be considered a lower limit .",
    "the difference in rest equivalent widths ( ew@xmath114 ) between a and b are 3  for c  iv , 8  for ly  @xmath24 and 3  for c  iii ] .",
    "measuring ew@xmath114(c  iv ) requires connecting the red and blue halves of the spectra because the blue side spectrum terminates on the red wing of the c  iv emission line , causing the continuum windows to fall on different spectrographs . we calculate a scaling factor of 1.22 using the regions of overlap .",
    "but there is some evidence that the same scaling factor might not apply to quasar b because of large fluctuations in the data over that region",
    ". therefore the ew@xmath114(c  iv ) differences of 3  should be considered an upper limit . indeed , restricting ourselves to the blue regions alone and fitting gaussians to the emission lines we find quasars a and b to differ at most by @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv)@xmath143 .",
    "the two methods yield the same flux . for completeness , and because the numbers have not been published elsewhere , we also measure other line fluxes and summarize them in table 2 , although some we do not use in our analysis .",
    "all of the line fluxes are measured with the technique described in francis ( 1993a ) except for n  v. because the blending with ly  @xmath24 , the measurement for n  v lines is done by fitting gaussians to ly  @xmath24 simultaneously with n  v where we assumed that both lines are similar in shape .",
    "for the other quasar pairs we estimated bounds on the c  iv equivalent width and the spectral index @xmath24 based on the published spectra .",
    "for the 5 most similar pairs , we estimate that they have spectral differences @xmath144 and @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv )  @xmath145(see table 3 ) .",
    "for the two pairs whose spectra have the worst noise ( q  1120 + 0195 ( michalitsianos et al .",
    "1997 ) and q  1429008 ( hewett et al .  1989 ) ) the estimates are rough , while they are more accurate for the other three pairs . since the estimates of the equivalent widths may be imprecise , we will also quote results by doubling our bound on the differences to @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv )  @xmath146 .",
    "we summarize our parameter estimates for the pairs in table 3 .",
    "to compute the probability that two random quasars have given differences in c  iii ] , ly  @xmath24 , c  iv equivalent widths and spectral slope @xmath24 , we randomly draw the properties of two quasars at a time from the compiled number distributions .",
    "if the spectral features are completely uncorrelated , the likelihood that two quasars are similar to each other , i.e. have differences of less than @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv ) , @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iii ] ) , etc . , is simply the joint product of each individual probability .",
    "however , if there are correlations , they could make the alarming similarities of the quasar pairs a trivial selection effect .",
    "therefore we first explore the extent to which spectral features are correlated .    through a principal component analysis , francis et al .",
    "( 1992 ) showed that the equivalent widths of quasar emission lines are correlated with the power law slope @xmath24 .",
    "francis ( 1993b ) further showed that @xmath24 is correlated with redshift .",
    "their study was based on correlations with a spectral slope distribution in francis et al .",
    "( 1992 ) which has a large rms dispersion of about @xmath138 . the strongest correlation",
    ", al  iii@xmath147c  iii ] with @xmath24 , has a large scatter ; the correlations of this and other lines are very weak .",
    "subsequently , francis ( 1996 ) , using more accurate photometry , found that the spectral slope distribution actually has a much narrower dispersion of @xmath137 .",
    "but the newer study does not affect the dispersions of the line strengths , which are more accurate as long as they are measured consistently . because the scatter of the line strengths remains large for a much reduced range in spectral slopes , the correlations are weaker in light of the narrow distribution compared to francis et al.(1992 ) .",
    "furthermore , plotting spectral slope _ vs. _",
    "redshift from francis ( 1996 ) shows that there is no correlation between the two parameters . in the analysis",
    "below , we will use the narrow power law distribution found in francis ( 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the correlations between line emission , continuum , slopes and redshifts can be safely ignored for our purposes .    nonetheless , to confirm that correlations are unimportant even under extreme scenarios we conduct the following monte carlo experiment to choose quasars from the number distributions found in francis et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and francis ( 1993a ) .",
    "we select from the broader spectral slope distribution where correlations were originally found .",
    "the correlation between emission line strengths and @xmath24 , and @xmath24 with redshift @xmath148 , means that the process of drawing quasars must proceed in a sequence to account for correlations at each step : first we draw quasars out of the lbqs redshift distribution , then the spectral slope distribution , followed at last by the emission line distribution . to account for the correlation of @xmath24 with redshift we do the following .",
    "having picked a redshift , and given the power law distribution @xmath24 , we offset the entire distribution by an amount @xmath149 ( see figure 2 of francis 1993b ) .",
    "we can then randomly select a value of @xmath24 from this new distribution .",
    "there is , however , one subtlety .",
    "the distribution for @xmath24 contains no redshift information because it is summed over all redshifts .",
    "but because of the correlation , if quasars at _ any given _ redshift have a small dispersion in their spectral slopes , as one accumulates the distribution over broader redshift ranges , the _ net _ distribution would also gradually become wider .",
    "we account for this effect by arbitrarily shrinking the dispersion and then drawing from this narrower spectral slope distribution instead of the original , broader one .",
    "we verified that decreasing the dispersion by 25% , more than one would expect , would not significantly alter our discussions below .",
    "once a value for @xmath24 has been selected , one can then proceed in the same fashion to select from the number distribution of c  iii ] , c  iv , or ly  @xmath24 , accounting for their roughly linear correlations with @xmath24 by : @xmath150 where the correlation coefficients @xmath151 and @xmath152 are given in francis et al .",
    "again , we verified that any correlations would only begin to affect our conclusions if the number distributions were all narrowed by more than 25% .",
    "there may also be weak correlations of quasar spectral properties with luminosity .",
    "the pair members share a common redshift and have similar luminosities , so we would under - estimate the likelihood of the members possessing similar spectra if the distributions of spectral indices are correlated with either variable .",
    "we saw that the spectral index correlation with redshift has little or no role in our analysis .",
    "the baldwin ( baldwin 1977 ) effect , a correlation between luminosity and c  iv equivalent width , has been studied extensively ( e.g. more recently see kinney et al .  1990 , sargent et al .",
    "1989 , baldwin et al .",
    "their results show that at a given luminosity the equivalent widths of the c  iv emission line have a defined range in strengths , with a scatter of about 20 .",
    "the strength of the c  iv lines decreases with luminosity and the relation holds over 7 orders of magnitude in quasar luminosity .",
    "the parameterization of the correlation : @xmath153 has @xmath48 ranging from @xmath154 ( francis et al .",
    "1992 ) to @xmath155 ( smetanka et al .",
    "lbqs quasars , being a magnitude limited sample , have only a small spread in absolute luminosity , @xmath156 ( francis et al .",
    "1992 ) . since at any luminosity",
    "there is a considerable scatter in c  iv and vice versa ( see osmer & shields 1988 for summary ) , we do not expect the luminosity correlations to affect our analysis . nonetheless , we tested for any effects by deriving the distribution of @xmath157 both with and without limits on the luminosity difference @xmath158 of the quasars making up the simulated pairs using the @xmath159 magnitudes and ew@xmath114(c  iv ) values for the 439 lbqs survey quasars from francis ( 1993 ) .",
    "we found no significant differences between the distributions without a luminosity restriction and those where the quasars were required to have absolute luminosities differing by less than a factor of 5 ( @xmath160 mag ) or a factor of 2.5 ( @xmath62 mag ) .",
    "because the parameter correlations are very weak , in the discussions that follow , we make the assumption that no two spectral features are correlated .",
    "as discussed previously , the spectra of q  1634 + 267 a and b have equivalent width differences @xmath161  for @xmath162 ; 8  for ly  @xmath24 ; and 3  for c  iii ] , as well as 0.03 for @xmath24 .",
    "if we select randomly from the distributions of these features in the lbqs survey , the probability of finding two quasars with smaller differences are 11% , 16% , 30% , and 12% respectively . assuming no correlations between the features , the joint probability of the differences being as small as observed is 0.06% .",
    "with such a low joint probability , it would be reasonable to find several quasars with such similar spectra in the total quasar population ( @xmath163 quasars ) , but highly unlikely to find any in the tiny sub - population of quasar pairs ( @xmath164 objects ) .",
    "the strength of this conclusion depends only weakly on the details of the comparison , and the joint probability only rises to 1% if we confine the comparison to the spectral index and c  iv equivalent width differences . adding additional spectral features to the estimate",
    "would further reduce the likelihood , but it becomes increasingly important to fully understand the spectral correlations of quasars .",
    "moreover , calculations of _ a posteriori _ probabilities can generally yield arbitrarily low likelihoods by over - specifying the problem . nonetheless , the similarity of the q  1634 + 267 a and b spectra extends across the entire rest - uv spectra of the pair .",
    "because we pre - selected q  1634 + 267a , b for study because of its spectral similarities , we can not interpret it in isolation from the rest of the pair population .",
    "moreover , the uncanny similarities of q  1634 + 267a , b are not an isolated example among the pairs . to fully understand the significance of the spectral similarities of the pairs",
    ", we must consider the entire pair population .    under the assumption that the quasars making up the pair sample are drawn from the same parent population as the quasars in the lbqs",
    ", we can produce mock samples of quasar pairs by randomly selecting 14 pairs of quasars from the lbqs .",
    "we can then compare the distribution of the spectral slope and c  iv equivalent width differences , @xmath165 and @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv ) , to those observed for the pairs .",
    "we will estimate the probability of finding at least as many similar pairs as observed in the real sample .",
    "we generated @xmath166 mock pair catalogs to determine the fraction of catalogs in which n@xmath167 pairs have spectral differences smaller than the specified limits on @xmath168 and @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv ) , with the results illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "the top panel shows the limits on spectral similarity ( @xmath144 and @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv)@xmath145 ) which characterize the differences observed for the 5 pairs with similar spectra ( q  2138431 , lbqs  1429008 , q  1634 + 267 , q  1120 + 0195 and q  2345 + 007 ) .",
    "the chance of drawing 5 or more pairs with such similar spectra in the sample of 14 pairs is about 0.2% . if we were to relax the constraints to @xmath144 and @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv)@xmath146  to account for possible systematic errors in measuring @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv ) , the probability for finding 5 or more such pairs grows only to 3% .",
    "we conclude that the likelihood for finding 5 pairs with such similar spectra in a sample of 14 pairs is low . if we significantly broaden the criterion for similarity ( @xmath169 and @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv)@xmath170 ) , the likelihood of finding five or more similar pairs rises to 60% .",
    "however , with these weaker criteria there are now seven observed pairs meeting the criterion for similarity ( we should add qj  0240343 and lbqs  21532056 ) , and the likelihood of finding seven or more similar pairs is then smaller , at 20% .",
    "we regard this third case as a significant under - estimate of the similarities .",
    "the low probability for finding similar quasars randomly , using two parameters , may only be an upper bound . if our pairs sample were partly made up of gravitational lenses , microlensing and time delay might cause some spectral differences in those systems .",
    "it is impossible to quantify such a conjecture with our pairs sample .",
    "the probability for finding similar quasars is significantly lower if we use a broad continuum slope distribution ( e.g. francis 1992 ) rather than the narrow distribution of francis ( 1996 ) used for the estimates in figure 3 . for the broad estimate of the @xmath24 distribution , the likelihoods for drawing at least 5 similar pairs under the same three sets of constraints on @xmath168 and @xmath142ew@xmath114(c  iv )",
    "are 0.01 , 0.2% and 1.2% instead of 0.2% , 3.0% and 20% ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "thus , the debate about the width of the continuum slope distribution does not alter the conclusion that the spectral similarities of the pairs are unlikely to occur by chance unless the distribution is even narrower than that found by francis ( 1996 ) .",
    "the distribution of c  iv equivalent widths , _ as long as measured consistently _ , does not suffer from the systematic problems of the spectral slope distribution .",
    "we again confirm that there is no sign of a lensing galaxy or a surrounding group or cluster of galaxies near the q  1634 + 267a , b quasar pair .",
    "our limit on the mass - to - light ratio is @xmath171 in the @xmath28 band , tighter than previous estimates .",
    "we also lack a candidate galaxy within @xmath14  kpc for producing the @xmath112 mg  ii absorption feature in the spectrum of a. since the existence of even one large separation lens produced by a `` dark '' mass distribution has profound implications , confirming or disproving the lens hypothesis is highly desirable .",
    "it appears from the data in the literature that the flux ratio of the quasars is significantly time variable , changing from 4.4 ( djorgovski & spinrad 1984 ) to 2.83 ( turner et al .",
    "1988 ) , to 3.28 ( ss91 ) and 3.34 ( this work ) . with its large angular separation , regular photometric monitoring of the system to search for",
    "a time delay would be simple on modest size , ground - based telescopes .",
    "although we found that the pairs q  1634 + 267 , q  1120 + 0195 , and lbqs  1429008 , are at best weak radio sources , with upper limits on their fluxes of @xmath172 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39  mjy / beam at @xmath173 cm , deeper observations may still detect the sources or demonstrate that both members are at the extremes of the radio to optical flux ratio distribution .",
    "deep x - ray observations would also be useful , both to measure the flux ratio of the quasars and to search for hot x - ray emitting gas associated with any lensing potential .",
    "deep ir imaging should detect the quasar host galaxies , whose shapes must show tangential , arc distortions under the lens hypothesis .",
    "the spectral similarities of some of the quasar pairs has always been the major impetus for the `` dark '' lens interpretation of the systems . to date",
    ", these arguments have been based on the similarities of individual pairs rather than the overall pair population . using the distribution of continuum slopes and",
    "c  iv equivalent widths , we demonstrated that it was improbable to find as many similar pairs as observed in the existing sample of 14 pairs .",
    "the probability estimates range from 0.01% to 3% , depending on how strictly similarity is defined and depending on whether a broad or narrow distribution was used for the continuum slope distribution .",
    "a better quantitative analysis needs a uniform spectral survey of the pairs .",
    "the effects of binary quasar interaction on spectral similarity have been surmised , for example , by schneider ( 1993 ) .",
    "kochanek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) demonstrated that most of the quasar pairs are binary quasars rather than `` dark lenses . ''",
    "the binary quasar hypothesis is a successful quantitative interpretation of both the number of quasar pairs and the distribution of their separations .",
    "if they are all binary quasars , then there must be a physical explanation for the spectral similarities .",
    "binary quasars are examples of quasar activity triggered by mergers , which represent a small fraction of all quasar activity ( about 5% in simple models , see kochanek et al .",
    "we present two hypotheses for how binary quasars can have such similar spectra .",
    "first , if the physical properties of quasars triggered by major mergers ( e.g. mass , accretion rate , surrounding gas density ) were confined to a limited range of values compared to the overall quasar population , then the observable properties of the binaries would be more similar than those of randomly selected quasars .",
    "this hypothesis has a definite , testable prediction  the spectra of the different pairs should be more similar to each other than for randomly selected quasars .",
    "it would also be expected that the quasar host galaxies have properties commensurate with being the products of major mergers  which can be tested by deep imaging .",
    "second , if quasar spectra have a significant dependence on the age of the activity , then the binary spectra are more similar than for random quasars because the merger provides a common triggering event for the activity in the two systems . here",
    "we would not expect the spectra of the different pairs to show any more similarity than randomly selected quasars . in either case ,",
    "the binary quasar population becomes a very important probe of the physics of quasars because it provides evidence for correlations between events on large scales and the detailed operation of the central engine .",

    "<S> depending on how strictly we define similarity , we estimate that only 0.013% of randomly drawn samples of 14 quasar pairs would have as many similar pairs as the observational sample . </S>"
