    "molecular self - assembly is one of the basic mechanisms of life and matter , and thus , modeling and measurements of naturally occurring self - assembling systems has long been pursued in the biological and physical sciences @xcite . despite the large number of papers that are currently reported , many of the ideas that are crucial to the development of this area ( molecular shape , interplay between enthalpy and entropy , nature of the forces that connect the particles in self - assembled molecular aggregates ) are simply not yet under the control of investigators .",
    "self - assembly also poses a number of substantial technological challenges @xcite .",
    "in fact , the biological systems use self - assembly to assemble macromolecules and structures . imitating these strategies and creating novel molecules with the ability to self - assemble into supramolecular assemblies is an important technique in nanotechnology .",
    "there is then a need for understanding the basic principles governing this type of organization .",
    "it is obvious that a complete analysis of the self - assembly phenomenon is a quite difficult subject because of the complexity of the involved microscopic mechanisms .",
    "for this reason , the understanding of simple models with increasing complexity might be a help and a guide to establish a general framework for the study of this kind of systems , and to stimulate the development of more sophisticated models which can be able to reproduce concrete experimental situations .",
    "computer simulations have shown that spherical particles interacting isotropically through repulsive interparticle interactions can spontaneously assemble into anisotropic structures @xcite .",
    "the presence of an isotropic short ranged interparticle attraction coupled to a longer ranged repulsion can also yield anisotropic structures .",
    "however , most real components , from proteins to ions @xcite to the wide variety of recently synthesized nanoparticles @xcite , interact via anisotropic or  patchy \" attractions .",
    "simulation work @xcite reveals assembly pathways of such components to be in general richer than those of their isotropic counterparts .",
    "experimental realization of such systems is growing .",
    "an example of real patchy particles is presented in ref .",
    "such particles offer the possibility to be used as building blocks of specifically designed self - assembled structures @xcite .",
    "moreover , the implications of patchy colloids for proteins @xcite , which are patchy by nature , could be significant .",
    "in this line , we consider in this paper the general problem of particles with strongly anisotropic , highly directional interactions in which effectively attractive patches induce the reversible self - assembly of particles into chains , i.e. , equilibrium polymerization @xcite .",
    "recently , several research groups reported on the assembly of colloidal particles in linear chains . selectively functionalizing the ends of hydrophilic nanorods with hydrophobic polymers ,",
    "nie et al . reported the observation of rings , bundles , chains , and bundled chains @xcite . in another experimental study carried out by chang et al .",
    "@xcite , gold nanorods were assembled into linear chains using a biomolecular recognition system . in a direct relation with the present work , clair et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the self - assembly of terephthalic acid ( tpa ) molecules on the au(111 ) surface . using scanning tunneling microscopy , the authors showed that the tpa molecules arrange in one - dimensional chains with a discrete number of orientations relative to the substrate .",
    "it is well known that solutions of self - assembled chains exhibit a transition from a disordered isotropic phase to an ordered nematic phase as the concentration of particles increases . experimental examples of equilibrium polymer systems that exhibit a isotropic - nematic ( in ) phase transition include wormlike micelles @xcite and self - assembled protein fibers like @xmath0-actin @xcite . in this context , a recent paper was devoted to the study of a system of self - assembled rigid rods adsorbed on a two - dimensional lattice @xcite . in ref . [ ] , tavares et al . studied a system composed of monomers with two attractive ( sticky ) poles that polymerize reversibly into polydisperse chains and , at the same time , undergo a isotropic - nematic ( in ) continuous phase transition @xcite .",
    "so , the interplay between the self - assembly process and the nematic ordering is a distinctive characteristic of these systems . using an approach in the spirit of the zwanzig model @xcite",
    ", the authors found that nematic ordering enhances bonding .",
    "in addition , the average rod length was described quantitatively in both phases , while the location of the ordering transition , which was found to be continuous , was predicted semiquantitatively by the theory . with respect to the characteristics of the phase transition",
    ", it has recently been shown that , at intermediate density , the in transition is in the @xmath1 potts universality class @xcite .        the temperature - coverage phase diagram obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] is qualitative only , and the theory overestimates the critical temperature in all range of coverage .",
    "in addition , the possibility of a reentrant nematic transition at high densities @xcite was not investigated by tavares et al .. accordingly , the main objective of the present work is to provide an accurate determination of the phase diagram of the system . for this purpose , extensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , supplemented by finite - size scaling analysis and two analytical approximations ,",
    "have been carried out to obtain the critical temperature characterizing the in phase as a function of the coverage .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the lattice - gas model . the simulation scheme and computational results",
    "are given in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we present the analytical approximations [ mean - field approximation ( mf ) , and real space renormalization group approach ( rsrg ) ] and compare the mc results with the theoretical calculations . finally , the general conclusions are drawn in sec . v.",
    "as in refs . [ ] , we consider a system of self - assembled rods with a discrete number of orientations in two dimensions .",
    "we assume that the substrate is represented by a square lattice of @xmath2 adsorption sites , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath3 particles are adsorbed on the substrate with two possible orientations along the principal axis of the square lattice .",
    "these particles interact with nearest - neighbors ( nn ) through anisotropic attractive interactions ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . then , the adsorbed phase is characterized by the hamiltonian    @xmath4    where @xmath5 indicates a sum over nn sites ; @xmath6 represents the nn lateral interaction between two neighboring @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which are aligned with each other and with the intermolecular vector @xmath9 ; and @xmath10 is the occupation vector with @xmath11 if the site @xmath7 is empty , @xmath12 if the site @xmath7 is occupied by a particle with orientation along the @xmath13-axis , and @xmath14 if the site @xmath7 is occupied by a particle with orientation along the @xmath15-axis .    a cluster or uninterrupted sequence of bonded particles is a self - assembled rod . at fixed temperature ,",
    "the average rod length increases as the density increases and the polydisperse rods will undergo an nematic ordering transition @xcite .",
    "since each site state is characterized by a three - state variable , we can rewrite hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in terms of new variables @xmath16 , where where @xmath17 represent the vertical ( @xmath18 ) and the horizontal ( @xmath19 ) orientations , while @xmath20 represents the empty state . then",

    "notice that the transformation @xmath22 is not a symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ h3 ] ) , since it is equivalent to a @xmath23 rotation of the lattice , but it is a symmetry of the system , since it left the partition function unchanged .",

    "hence , in that limit the present model reduces to the ising one with coupling constant @xmath29 .",
    "and @xmath30 ( inset ) . , width=226 ]      we have used a standard importance sampling mc method in the canonical ensemble @xcite and finite - size scaling techniques @xcite .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "starting with a random initial configuration ( sites occupied with concentration @xmath31 and particle axis orientation chosen with probability @xmath32 ) , successive configurations are generated by attempting to move single particles ( monomers ) .",
    "one of the two ( translation or rotation ) moves is chosen at random . in a translation move , an occupied site and an empty site",
    "are randomly selected and their coordinates are established .",
    "then , an attempt is made to interchange its occupancy state with probability given by the metropolis rule @xcite : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the difference between the hamiltonians of the final and initial states and @xmath35 ( being @xmath36 the boltzmann constant ) . for a rotation move , the rotational state of the chosen particle ( horizontal or vertical ) is changed with a probability determined by metropolis criteria .    a monte carlo step ( mcs )",
    "is achieved when @xmath37 sites have been tested to change its occupancy state .",
    "typically , the equilibrium state can be well reproduced after discarding the first @xmath38 mcs .",
    "then , the next @xmath39 mcs are used to compute averages .",
    "all calculations were carried out using the parallel cluster baco of universidad nacional de san luis , argentina .",
    "this facility consists of 60 pcs each with a 3.0 ghz pentium-4 processor and 90 pcs each with a 2.4 ghz intel core 2 quad processor .    in order to follow the formation of the nematic phase from the isotropic phase , we use the order parameter defined in ref .",

    "the reduced fourth - order cumulant , @xmath46 , introduced by binder @xcite , was calculated as : @xmath47 where the thermal average @xmath48 , in all the quantities , means the time average throughout the mc simulation .",
