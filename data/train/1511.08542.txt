    "in the early 60 s , quarks become the constituent of strong interaction and it raise to be a handy tool to describe the observed particles in the hadron spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is known that quarks can be in groups like a system of coupled quarks and coupled antiquarks .",
    "the idea of strongly coupled two - quarks - two - antiquarks mesons to baryon - antibaryon channels was suggested by r. jaffe @xcite , where the mit bag model used to predict the quantum numbers and the masses of prominent states .",
    "afterword a non - relativistic potential model ( nrpm ) was presented by zouzou et al .",
    "@xcite to investigate the system consisting of two - quarks and two - antiquarks with equal / unequal masses .",
    "precisely they were searching for probable bound states under the threshold for the spontaneous dissociation into two - mesons system .",

    "@xcite where it was the first study toward a relativistic three - quark bound - state using a hamiltonian consistent with the wigner - bargmann theorem and macroscopic locality .",
    "they used a potential which includes confinement and is of the general form consistent with rotation , space - reflection , and time - reversal invariance and it was a combination of linear , coulomb , spin - spin , spin - orbit , and tensor terms .",

    "they have treated the light quarks , in the heavy - light diquark , and diquarks quite relativistically .",
    "additionally they have discussed the experimental data on charmonium - like states above open charm threshold and they have found that the masses of ground state tetraquarks with hidden bottom are below the open bottom threshold .",
    "they have also shown that the anomalous scalar @xmath11 and axial vector @xmath12 mesons can not be considered as @xmath10 bound states , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 could be interpreted as scalar and tensor tetraquarks , respectively .    in a recent paper by monemzadeh et al .",

    "@xcite can discriminate between the masses of tetraquarks with axial - vector diquark content and different total angular momentum @xmath16 in a spin - independent framework .",
