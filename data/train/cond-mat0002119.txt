    "nonlinear optics has been made possible by the nonlinear nature of the interaction between light and matter and by the development of intense light sources that can probe the nonlinear regime of this interaction .",
    "nonlinear optical processes include three- and four - wave mixing ( 4wm ) processes ( e.g. , second harmonic generation and third harmonic generation ) . in 4wm three waves ( or light pulses ) mix to produce a fourth . in this paper",

    "@xcite proposed a 4wm experiment using three colliding bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) wavepackets with different momenta .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite successfully demonstrated 4wm in an experiment with three bec wavepackets , which interact in a nonlinear manner to make a fourth bec wavepacket .",
    "here we greatly elaborate on and further develop the theory and describe numerical simulations of the 4wm output that agree well with the experimental measurements of  @xcite .    the experimental study of nonlinear atom optics is made possible by the advent of bose - einstein condensation of dilute atomic gases  @xcite and the atom `` laser ''  @xcite , a source of coherent matter - waves analogous to the output of optical lasers .",
    "a set of optical light pulses incident on a parent condensate with momentum @xmath0 can , by bragg scattering  @xcite , create two new daughter bec wavepackets with momenta @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "four - wave mixing in a single spin - component condensate occurs as a result of the nonlinear self - interaction term in the hamiltonian for a bec when three such bec wavepackets with momenta @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 collide and interact .",
    "the nonlinear self - interaction can generate a new bec wavepacket with a new momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the possibility of nonlinear effects in atom optics has been long recognized  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that phase conjugation of matter waves should be possible in analogy to this phenomenon in nonlinear optics , including the case of multiple spin - component condensates  @xcite .",
    "they considered the case where a `` probe '' bec wavepacket interacts with two counter - propagating `` pump '' wavepackets to generate a fourth that is phase conjugate to the probe , where the probe is weak and causes negligible depletion of the pump .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also suggested analogies between interactions in multiple spin - component condensates and four - wave mixing .",
    "goldstein and meystre  @xcite develop a theory of 4wm in multicomponent becs based on an algebraic angular momentum approach to obtain the modes of the coupled operator equations .",
    "our treatment for a single spin - component condensate is based on the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , which has proved to be highly successful in describing the properties of a variety of actual bec experiments  @xcite .",
    "thus , our treatment is for a zero temperature condensate .",
    "it also can describe 4wm with or without the presence of a trapping potential .",
    "the nature of 4wm in bec collisions of matter waves is unlike 4wm for optical wavepacket collisions in dispersive media  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity in the case of bec is introduced by collisions rather than by interaction with an external medium , and the momentum and energy constraints imposed are different in the two cases .",
    "the kinetic energy of massive particle waves is quadratic in the wavevector of the particles and given by @xmath7 , whereas the energy of a photon is linear in the vacuum wavevector of the photon , @xmath8 , and is given by @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the momentum of massive particle waves is linear in the wavevector of the particles and given by @xmath10 , whereas for light in a dispersive medium , it is proportional to the product of the frequency of the light , @xmath11 and the refractive index , @xmath12 , where the refractive index depends upon frequency ( and the propagation direction in non - isotropic media ) . hence , conservation of energy does not in general guarantee conservation of momentum in optical 4wm .",
    "clearly , complications involving the properties of an additional medium does not arise in the bec case . in any case",
    ", the creation of new bec wavepackets in 4wm is limited to cases when momentum , energy and particle number conservation are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "in this paper we develop a general three - dimensional ( 3d ) description of four - wave mixing in single - spin - component bose - einstein condensates using a mean - field approach similar to the time - dependent gpe , also known as the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "we introduce the slowly - varying - envelope approximation ( svea ) , a very powerful tool that not only gives insight into the nature of 4wm but also gives a set of four coupled equations for the four interacting bec waves that are more computationally tractable for numerical simulations of the time - dependent dynamics .",
    "section [ theory ] explains the experimental situation we have in mind and develops the basic theoretical methods .",
    "section [ ns ] describes the results of our numerical calculations and compares these to the nist experiment @xcite . finally , in sec .  [ conclusions ] we present a summary and conclusion .",
    "in this section we describe the theoretical tools used in our study of 4wm of matter waves .",
    "section [ secbragg ] reviews how high momentum components of a bec can be formed using optical bragg pulses to prepare the initial configuration for the `` half collision '' event .",
    "section [ secscales ] specifies the parameters that describe the strength of the various physical effects that play a role in 4wm : diffraction , potential energy , nonlinear self - energy , and collisions between the different momentum wavepackets .",
    "this section also describes how to transform between 1d , 2d and 3d calculations involving the gpe .",
    "this is important because , without the slowly - varying - envelope approximation ( svea ) that we introduce below , full 3d calculations are too computationally expensive to carry out for the actual experimental conditions .",
    "hence , the svea must be explicitly checked in 2d against the full gp solution .",

    ". then section [ simple ] introduces a simple estimate for the 4wm output .",
    "finally , section [ el_scat ] shows how the effect of elastic scattering between atoms in different momentum wavepackets can be accounted for .",
    "this process causes loss of atoms from the wavepackets and lowers the 4wm output .",
    "let us consider three bec wavepackets moving with central momenta @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "such moving wavepackets can be created , for example , by optically - induced bragg diffraction of a condensate @xcite .",
    "if these three wavepackets overlap spatially , the self - energy of the atoms can produce matter - wave 4wm , just as the third - order kerr type nonlinearity can produce optical 4wm in nonlinear media .",
    "one can imagine a number of scenarios in which 4wm can occur in matter - wave interactions .",
    "one can consider a `` whole collision '' in which three initially separated bec wavepackets collide together at the same time , or a `` half collision '' in which the wavepackets are initially formed in the same condensate at ( nearly ) the same time .",

    "@xcite , the `` half collision '' case is easier to realize experimentally @xcite using the above - mentioned bragg diffraction technique  @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we consider only this configuration , in which the three wavepackets initially overlap because they have been created as copies of the initial condensate .",
    "these wavepackets have different non - vanishing central momenta and therefore they fly apart from one another after they have been created .",

    "nonlinear 4wm creates a fourth wavepacket with momentum @xmath16 .",
    "we demonstrate below in sec .",
    "[ secsvea ] that four - wave mixing of matter waves is only possible if there exists a coordinate frame in which the mixing is degenerate , that is , all four @xmath17 values in this frame have the same magnitude . fig .",
    "[ f2]b shows the degenerate frame corresponding to a moving frame with velocity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the atomic mass .",
    "the total momentum is zero in the degenerate frame , and the wavepackets move in oppositely moving pairs .",

    "the angle @xmath15 is given by @xmath23 , and the length of the vector @xmath4 is given by @xmath24 .",
    "[ f1]b shows a set of different possible values of @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the condensate has only a single spin - component , and that its dynamics can be described by the gpe , which is known to provide an excellent account of condensate properties @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the kinetic energy operator , @xmath27 is the external potential imposed on the atoms , @xmath28 is the atom - atom interaction strength that is proportional to the @xmath29-wave scattering length @xmath30 ( assumed to be positive ) , @xmath19 is the atomic mass , and @xmath31 is the total number of atoms .",
    "the numerical methods for solving the gpe are described below in sec .",
    "[ ns ] .",
    "first , we use the gpe to obtain the ground state condensate in the trapping potential at time @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "this condensate wavefunction is centered around @xmath34 , and normalized to unity .",
    "we assume , as is the case in the nist experiments  @xcite , that the trapping potential @xmath27 is turned off at @xmath32 and that the condensate is allowed to evolve under the influence of only the mean - field interaction until time @xmath35 .",
    "this includes the special case @xmath36 .",
    "we could equally well treat the case of leaving the trap on , and we would obtain similar results .",
    "( [ gp ] ) determines the evolved condensate wavefunction , @xmath37 . after this period of free evolution ,",
    "the bragg pulses are applied to create the wavepackets with momenta @xmath38 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the momentum differences @xmath39 are much larger than the momentum spread of the initial parent bec wavepacket .",
    "the experimental time scale @xmath40 for creating these wavepackets is short ( @xmath41 70 @xmath42s ) compared to the time scale on which the wavepackets evolve .",
    "the state at @xmath43 provides the initial condition for subsequent evolution of these three wavepackets as they undergo nonlinear evolution .",
    "the initial state at @xmath44 immediately after the bragg pulse sequences can be approximated in a number of ways . in principle",
    "one could set up a set of coupled gpes for the ground and excited atomic state components and explicitly include the effect of coupling the light field to the excited electronic state .",
    "a simpler approach would be to carry out an adiabatic elimination of the excited state and develop an effective light - shift potential in which the ground state atoms move .",
    "if such approaches are carried out in this case , they show that the light acts as a `` sudden '' perturbation such that each of the wavepackets with central momenta @xmath45 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 is to a very good approximation simply a `` copy '' of the parent condensate at @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "thus , the initial condition immediately after the application of the bragg pulses can be approximated as being comprised of three bec wavepackets , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fraction of atoms in wavepacket @xmath49 , and @xmath50 so the norm of @xmath51 remains unity .",

    "the nonlinear term in the gpe generates a wavepacket with central momentum @xmath52 , as long as the constraints discussed in relation to figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] are satisfied .",
    "energy and momentum are conserved during the wavepacket evolution .",
    "this can be readily checked by verifying that @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the energy per particle and @xmath56 is the momentum per particle .",
    "we have verified numerically that energy and momentum are indeed conserved in our calculations described in section [ ns ] .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss characteristic time scales that can be used to estimate the importance of the various effects occurring during the dynamics for a particular set of experimental parameters .",
    "it is convenient to use the thomas  fermi ( tf ) approximation  @xcite to give quantitative estimates of the size of the condensate and the time scales characterizing the dynamics . in the tf approximation ,",
    "one neglects the kinetic energy operator in the time - independent nonlinear schrdinger equation , @xmath57 where @xmath42 is the chemical potential , to obtain the following analytical expression for the wavefunction : @xmath58 for @xmath59 such that @xmath60 and @xmath61 otherwise .",
    "the tf approximation is valid for sufficiently large numbers of atoms @xmath31 .",
    "it is convenient to define the geometric average of the oscillator frequencies for an asymmetric harmonic potential as @xmath62 .",
    "the size of the condensate is then given by the tf radius @xmath63 , where the tf approximation to the chemical potential @xmath42 is determined by the normalization of the wavefunction to unity and is given by @xmath64 . hence , the tf radius @xmath65 scales with @xmath31 as @xmath66 .",
    "the size of the tf wavepacket in the @xmath67 @xmath14 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 directions is @xmath70 .    in order to estimate the importance of the various terms in the gpe , we set @xmath71 for free wavepacket evolution and rewrite eq .",

    "the smaller the characteristic time , the larger is the corresponding term in the gpe .",
    "we also define the collision duration time @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the initial relative velocity of wavepackets 1 and 3 .",

    "the ratio @xmath84 gives an indication of the strength of the nonlinearity during the collision .",
    "the larger the ratio of @xmath84 , the stronger the effects of the nonlinearity during the overlap of the wavepackets .",
    "these characteristic times stand in the ratios @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the de broglie wavelength associated with the wavepacket velocity @xmath87 .",
    "experimental condensates with @xmath88 can be readily achieved .",
    "thus , the nonlinear term will have time to act while the bec wavepackets remain physically overlapped during a collision .",
    "another relevant time scale in the dynamics is the characteristic condensate expansion time , @xmath89 . in the typical experiments modeled below , @xmath90 .",
    "in addition to time scales , there are several natural length scales that are important : the size @xmath65 of the condensate , the scale @xmath91 of phase variation across the parent condensate as it expands and develops a momentum spread @xmath92 due to the mean field potential , and the scale @xmath93 of phase variation due to the fast imparted momentum @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the common magnitude of the momentum for the packets in the degenerate frame ( fig .",
    "these stand in the relation @xmath96 .",
    "the grid spacings in numerical calculations are determined by the necessity to resolve the wavefunction on its fastest scale of variation .",
    "thus , using the form of eq .",
    "( [ in_con ] ) for @xmath51 requires a grid smaller than @xmath93 .",
    "this requirement limits practical calculations to 2 dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "we will introduce an approximation in the next section that allows three dimensional ( 3d ) calculations by eliminating the rapidly varying phase factors from the equations to be solved .",
    "we find it convenient to use reduced dimensionless variables to calculate the dynamics .",
    "the most commonly used set of reduced dimensionless variables in bec problems involves using `` trap units '' @xcite . here however , except for determining the initial conditions at @xmath32 , the trap potential is turned off , and trap units are not particularly relevant . since we do both 2d and 3d calculations , some care is needed in developing a set of units .",
    "the primary requirement to simulate 3d experiments with a 2d model is that the relations between the characteristic timescales , @xmath72 , @xmath83 and @xmath73 , are as determined by experiment .",

    "these phase modulation terms provide an effective potential for each wavepacket that accelerates the atoms in it and modifies its internal momentum distribution .",
    "before we propagate the svea equations , the initial wavefunction of the parent condensate is determined using the time - dependent gpe .",

    "atoms from two _ different _ momentum wavepackets can undergo @xmath29-wave elastic scattering that removes the atoms from the packets and scatters them into @xmath161 steradians @xcite .",

    "although the cloud of elastically scattered atoms can not be simply described by the mean - field picture , the loss of atoms from the wavepackets due to this elastic scattering mechanism can be described in terms of the svea .",
    "this is because each momentum component is treated separately , and the loss terms due to elastic scattering can be added to the svea equations .",
    "the elastic scattering loss is incorporated by adding loss terms to the right hand side of the envelope equations in the form of imaginary potentials that are proportional to the density of the `` other '' momentum component involved in the elastic scattering .",

    "the factor of @xmath171 in the loss terms is due to the fact that these are equations for the amplitudes , not the densities .",
    "the density dependence of the elastic scattering loss terms is identical to that of the mean - field interaction terms since both terms are due to elastic scattering .",
