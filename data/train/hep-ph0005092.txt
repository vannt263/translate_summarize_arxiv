    "there is a mass of data on reactions of the type @xmath17 for which the asymmetry @xmath18 under the reversal of the transverse spin is measured : @xmath19 some examples are shown in fig . 1 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite respectively .",

    "the    result depends on two unknown functions : @xmath13    and @xmath51 , which we can measure by    trying to fit the data .",
    "now , as stressed earlier , the asymmetries are large , so will demand large values of @xmath13 and @xmath51 .",
    "however , positivity requires that @xmath52 and the soffer bound @xcite restricts the magnitude of @xmath13 : @xmath53 \\label{soffer}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the usual longitudinal polarized quark density .",
    "how important is the soffer bound ? in fig .",
    "2 we show a typical picture of @xmath54 and @xmath55 . we see that :    a ) : :    @xmath54 is positive everywhere , so that    +    * @xmath56 is big    * rhs of soffer bound is large    * not very restrictive on @xmath57 b ) : :    @xmath54 is ( usually ) negative everywhere , so that    +    * @xmath58 is small    * rhs of soffer bound is small    * highly restrictive on @xmath59    but the measured asymmetries are such that @xmath60 , so that if the @xmath61 come mainly from the @xmath62-quarks and the @xmath63 from @xmath64-quarks we expect trouble in getting a large enough asymmetry for @xmath63 . indeed ,",
    "if we use the gehrmann - stirling ( gs ) @xcite @xmath54 and @xmath55 to bound @xmath57 and @xmath59 we obtain a catastrophic fit to the data ( fig .",
    "3 ) with @xmath65 !    can we escape this dilemma ? there is a surprising escape route ! + there is an old pqcd argument @xcite that requires for quarks , antiquarks and gluons @xmath66 which implies that all @xmath16 must become positive as @xmath67 .",
    "but almost all fits to polarized dis ignore this condition on the grounds that ( i ) eq .",
    "( [ pqcd - arg ] ) is incompatible with dglap evolution and that ( ii ) the data demand a negative @xmath55 . in fact",
    ", these arguments are spurious because ( i ) dglap is not valid as @xmath68 where one approaches the exclusive region and ( ii ) the data do not really extend to large @xmath3 . +",
    "so let us try to impose @xmath69 as @xmath68 in the fits to polarized dis .",
    "in fact , this was done by brodsky , burkhardt and schmidt ( bbs ) @xcite , but the treatment was rough and evolution was not included .",
    "this was improved upon by leader , sidorov and stamenov ( lss)@xmath70 @xcite so as to include evolution and a reasonably good fit to the polarized dis data was achieved . in fig .",
    "4 we compare the gs and bbs @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that the soffer bound on @xmath59 will be much less restrictive at large @xmath3 for the bbs case .",
    "indeed , using the bbs @xmath16 to bound the @xmath13 has a dramatic effect upon our attempts to fit the @xmath71 asymmetries as can be seen in fig .  5 where @xmath72 .",
    "in carrying out the fit @xcite we made the following simplifications :    a ) : :    the asymmetry is largest at large @xmath23    @xmath6 large @xmath3 is important .    therefore we used only @xmath62 and @xmath64 quarks .",
    "b ) : :    large @xmath23 @xmath6 large    @xmath73 in the fragmentation .",
    "hence we assumed    @xmath74 , @xmath75 only .",
    "c ) : :    the unknown functions were parameterized so that the bounds in eqs .",
    "( [ positivity ] ) and ( [ soffer ] ) are automatically satisfied .",
    "thus we    took    @xmath76 \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2}[q(x)+\\delta q(x ) ] \\right\\}\\ ] ] and    @xmath77 \\ { 2\\,d(z ) \\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 are real    constants with @xmath79 , and the functions in    square brackets have modulus @xmath80 .",
    "the fit to the    asymmetry data then determines a range of possible    @xmath57 and @xmath59 as shown    in fig .",
    "a ) : :    it seems that the soft collins mechanism can explain the    semi - inclusive transverse spin asymmetries if    @xmath57 and @xmath59 are    large enough in magnitude .",
    "b ) : :    this , via the soffer bound , seems to require    @xmath69 as @xmath68 .",
    "c ) : :    for the @xmath64-quark this implies that    @xmath55 must change sign and become positive at    large @xmath3 .",
    "d ) : :    this , in turn , has a significant effect upon the shape of    @xmath81 at large @xmath3 . fig .",
    "7 compares the    behavior of @xmath81 for the `` best '' usual fit to the    polarized parton densities with that from fits satisfying    @xmath82 .",
    "the exciting link between    transverse asymmetries and polarized dis emphasizes the importance of    extending that polarized dis measurements to larger x. e ) : :    some notes of caution : +    ( i ) the collins mechanism does not seem able to produce large enough    @xmath18 at the largest @xmath23 measured .",
    "however ,    there does exist another kind of mechanism , outside the framework of    the usual parton model , based on correlated quark - gluon densities in a    hadron , which can also produce a transverse spin asymmetry",
    ". it may be    that a superposition of the two mechanisms is needed .",
    "+    ( ii ) for either of these mechanisms @xmath18 must decrease    when @xmath83 becomes much greater than the    intrinsic @xmath84 .",
    "so far there is no sign of    such a decrease in the data .",
    "f ) : :    finally , we wish to re - emphasize the beautiful interplay between , at    first sight , quite unrelated aspects of particle physics .",
