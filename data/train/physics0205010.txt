    "the problem of validating scientific theories through numerical simulations have been discussed from several points of view @xcite .",
    "there is now almost no scientist ( physicist , chemist , biologist etc ) that does not use the powerful means of numerical simulations as a necessary tool in his research .",
    "moreover , it is accepted @xcite that if some scientific theory is found in its numerical simulation version to be valid on the screen then generally it is valid also outside it .",
    "thus , a correspondence may be drawn between the various stages in physical theories of first proposing the scientific theory ( writing the relevant equations ) , and then testing it through experiments to the analogous steps in computer simulations of first writing the program and then running it on the computer screen .",
    "this correspondence between the two processes is especially emphasized in the experimentation stage except for the differences due to their different characters .",
    "that is , whereas the physical theories are proved or refuted through real experiments performed in the ( three - dimensional ) laboratory , the relevant `` experiments '' in the numerical simulations are the running of the involved programs on the ( two - dimensional ) computer screen .",
    "first of all we note that a programmer who wants to numerically simulate any process may accomplish his task by writing any of a large number of different codes which are all equivalent for obtaining the same simulation . also , when he begin to write his program there is no way to predict beforehand the final code ( from all the possible ones ) so the writing stage of any numerical simulation has some unpredictability related to it .    in this work",
    "we are , especially , interested in the programming procedure and in the possible mathematical description of it .",
    "for this purpose we use the known fact that the written code of the numerical simulation of any process must contain the full and detailed description of the simulated phenomena .",
    "that is , only when one introduces into the code in advance all the details of the simulated system that he may expect an appropriate simulation of it when this program is later run on the computer screen .",
    "thus , since the programmer must be very careful in correctly describing in his code the behaviour of the simulated system one may suppose that the code - writing itself evolutes in such a manner that it reflects the real evolution of the simulated process .",
    "that is , referring to the correspondence between numerical simulation and physical theories , we assume that as the latter describe real processes as rates of change of some variables in the infinitesimal ( or infinite ) limits of other dependent variables so the simulation of this process may be described in an analogous way .",
    "one may analyze the numerical simulations from the point of view of two interacting systems ; the simulated system and the one that enables , through writing the relevant code , the numerical simulation of the former .",
    "the dominant and active system in this supposed interaction is of course the simulated one which actually dictate the content of the written code which should , as remarked , represent and describe the simulated system .",
    "thus , using the terminology of synergetics ( see , for example , page 195 in @xcite ) , the programming act is `` enslaved '' by the simulated system and may be actually discussed in terms of it .",
    "this is the basic and central property of synergetics which have been successfully applied not only to physics bu also to chemistry , biology and other exact disciplines .",
    "that is , one may describe the interaction between any two heavily interacting systems from the exclusive standpoint of the dominant system . in other words ,",
    "the evolution and development of the `` enslaved '' @xcite and passive process of writing the code may be entirely discussed in terms of the `` slaving '' and dominant simulated system as done here .",
    "thus , for taking into account the fact that there are many possible different codes which fulfill the same numerical tasks we introduce , as done in other analogous situations which involve different possible ways to obtain the same result ( see , for example , @xcite ) , an extra variable .",
    "we use here the known parisi - wu - namiki stochastic quantization ( sq ) method @xcite by which an additional variable have been introduced into either the langevin equation @xcite or the fokker - plank one @xcite . in this formalism",
    "one assumes that some ( generally unknown ) stochastic process @xcite occurs in the extra dimension of the additional variable and the equilibrium physical situations are approached in the limit of the elimination of this variable which is obtained by equating all its different values to each other and taking to infinity @xcite .",
    "this formalism is appropriate for the program - writing stage of the simulation which may evolute along different equivalent routes and , therefore , the unpredictable element of it corresponds to the mentioned stochastic process .",
    "the numerical equilibrium stage is obtained when the writing process ends and one remains with the finished program .    for a suitable analysis of the possibilities allowed at the code - writing stage",
    "we discuss a large ensemble of programmers which all try to perform the same numerical simulation .",
    "we calculte the probability to find all or most of them obtaining not only the same final simulation but also writing the same code which truly represents the simulated phenomena .",
    "that is , we want to find the path integral @xcite correlation and the conditions which must be fulfilled in order to obtain a large probability for finding them with the same numerical evolution which really describes the simulated system .",
    "thus , our ultimate test will be to find out if at the equilibrium stage after they have finished writing their codes the obtained simulation correctly represents the simulated real systems .",
    "this indeed will be shown in the following sections by the obtained expression for the correlation between the ensemble of codes which turns out to be very similar to the correspnding expression for an ensemble of the real simulated systems .    in section 2",
    "we present the sq method and relate it to numerical simulation . in section 3",
    "we restrict the discussion to the computer simulations which simulate the physical harmonic oscillator .",
    "we show , by discussing , as remarked , the simulation process in terms of the simulated harmonic oscillator , that the expression obtained for the correlation between the computers of the ensemble are very similar to the known expression for the correlation between the members of an ensemble of _ real _ quantum harmonic oscillators .    in section 4",
    "we discuss the numerical simulation of the known lamb shift process @xcite and show , using the sq formalism , the fokker - plank equation @xcite , and the classical feynman diagram @xcite that at the numerical equilibrium state one may obtain for the correlation , as for the harmonic oscillator case , the analogous known expression obtained in the framework of quantum field theory @xcite . in section 5",
    "we further analyze and summarize the discussion .",
    "as remarked , the code of any simulation process must be written so as to include and describe all the details of the simulated system if one wants the simulation to truly represents it .",
    "thus , one may expect that the programming act evolutes and developes in a manner which reflects the corresponding evolution of the simulated systems . and",
    "since , as noted , these real systems are mathematically described by taking rates of changes so the numerical simulation of them may likewise be discussed in such a manner .",
    "one have only to take into account the additional functionality , taken care of by the extra variable ( denoted @xmath2 ) , that by running different codes one may obtain the same numerical result .",
    "thus , if we denote the process of writing the code by the programmer @xmath3 by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , then these @xmath4 may be analyzed by taking the rates of their changes with respect to @xmath2 , that is , as the generalized langevin equation @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the remarked @xmath7-member ensemble of programmers which all try to perform the same numerical simulation .",
    "the @xmath8 s denote stochatic processes in the variable @xmath2 . as remarked",
    ", these processes stand here for the described unpredictable nature of the programming act where one can not predict beforehand the final code .",
    "the variables @xmath4 depends upon @xmath2 and upon the spatial - time axes @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the two dimensional spatial axes of the screen since these numerical simulations occur on the screen and @xmath11 is the time . the @xmath12",
    "are given in the sq theory by @xcite @xmath13}{\\partial q})_{q = q(s , t , x)},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 are the actions @xmath15 that determine the forms of @xmath4 and @xmath16 are their lagrangians . in order to discuss the `` evolution '' of the code - writing process which determines the simulation on the screen , we consider the time and @xmath2 intervals @xmath17 , @xmath18 and divide each of them into @xmath7 subintervals @xmath19 , @xmath20 ,  @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 ,",
    " @xmath24 .",
    "the subdivision of paths into small subintervals is basic and central in the path integral method not only in the quantum version of it but also in its application to classical systems .",
    "this subdivision is very important here for the two discussed examples of the harmonic oscillator in section 2 and the lamb shift in section 4 . since only by applying and calculating the relevant expressions ( the langevin equation here and the fokker - plank equation in the next section ) in these subintervals the results shown in the following are obtained .",
    "we assume that the langevin eq ( [ e1 ] ) is satisfied for each member of the ensemble at each subinterval with the following gaussian constraints @xcite @xmath25 where the angular brackets denote an ensemble average with the gaussian distribution .",
    "the @xmath26 signifies the @xmath7 subintervals of each member and the @xmath3 , @xmath27 denote these members where @xmath28 .",
    "since , as remarked , the written code should fully describe the evolution of the specific simulated process the @xmath29 have different meanings which depend upon the identity of this process and the context in which eqs ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) are used .",
    "thus , in the classical regime @xmath29 is @xcite @xmath30where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are respectively the boltzman constant , the temperature in kelvin units and the relevant friction force . in the quantum regime @xmath29",
    "is identified @xcite with the plank constant @xmath34 .",
    "we note that using eq ( [ e1 ] ) together with the specific constraints from eq ( [ e3 ] ) enables one @xcite to discuss a large number of different classical and quantum phenomena .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the right hand side of eq ( [ e3 ] ) may be written as @xmath35 which is the probability to have a value of @xmath8 in @xmath36 @xcite , where @xmath37 we want to calculate the green s functions @xmath38 which determine the correlation among the members of the ensemble @xcite .",
    "thus , one may define , as in @xcite , the green s functions which depend also upon the variable @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath39 where @xmath14 are the actions @xmath40 , @xmath41 is a normalization constant , and @xmath42 . as seen from the last equation the @xmath38",
    "were expressed as path integrals @xcite .",
    "note that the quantum feynman measure @xmath43 is replaced in eq ( [ e6 ] ) and in the following eq ( [ e7 ] ) by @xmath44 as required for the classical path integrals @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that when the @xmath2 s are different for the members of the ensemble so that each have its specific @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 the correlation in ( [ e6 ] ) is obviously zero .",
    "thus , in order to have a nonzero value for the probability to find a large part of the ensemble writing the same numerical code we have to consider the stationary configuration where , as remarked , all the @xmath2 values are equated to each other and eliminated . for that matter",
    "we take account of the fact that the dependence upon @xmath2 and @xmath11 is through @xmath48 so this ensures @xcite that this dependence is expressed through the @xmath2 and @xmath11 differences .",
    "for example , referring to the members @xmath3 and @xmath27 the correlation between them is @xmath49 , so that for eliminating the @xmath2 variable from the correlation function one equates all these different @xmath2 s to each other .",
    "we , thus , obtain the following stationary equilibrium correlation @xcite @xmath50 where the subscript of @xmath51 denotes the stationary configuration .",
    "in other words , the equilibrium correlation in our case is obtained when all the different @xmath2 values which give rise to different programs and so to different simulations are equated to each other in which case one remains with the set of programs which simulate the same system .",
    "thus , if all the members of the ensemble write the same version of the program which is mathematically described as having similar actions @xmath52 ( in which the @xmath2 values , which denote here different codes , are equated to each other ) one finds with a large probability these members , in the later equilibrium stage , with the same code . that is , introducing the same similar actions into the corresponding path integrals one finds this mentioned large probability .",
    "this is exemplified in the following section 3 for the harmonic oscillator and in section 4 for the energy shift case .",
    "as an application of the former discussion we calculate the correlation of the @xmath7 member ensemble with respect to the numerical simulations of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "that is , we calculate the probability to find all or most of the programmers writing the same code of the harmonic oscillator which truly represents the harmonic oscillator . at the initial time @xmath53",
    "when all the programmers just begin to write their respective versions of the harmonic oscillator code they are certainly identical to each other .",
    "that is , all the programmers begin from the same common starting point ( denoted @xmath54 ) and we want to find the probability that they end at the later time @xmath11 with the same code ( denoted @xmath55 ) which refers to the harmonic oscillator .",
    "we assume , for convenient mathematical representation of the following discussion , a @xmath56 member ensemble and also a subdivision of each of the intervals @xmath17 and @xmath18 into @xmath56 subintervals @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we write the langevin equation ( [ e1 ] ) for the subintervals @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the form @xcite @xmath61 the appropriate @xmath12 for the harmonic oscillator is @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath64 are conditioned as @xcite @xmath65 where the @xmath29 is as discussed after eq ( [ e3 ] ) and the probability from eq ( [ e4 ] ) assumes the following form for the harmonic oscillator @xcite @xmath66 which is the probability that the @xmath67 from the right hand side of eq ( [ e8 ] ) take the values at its left hand side @xcite and the index @xmath3 runs over the @xmath56 members of the ensemble .",
    "note that eqs ( [ e8])-([e10 ] ) are discussed in @xcite without relating the variable @xmath2 to any numerical simulation .",
    "here , we relate the variable @xmath2 to the possible numerical codes of the harmonic oscillator which are written , as remarked , so as to reflect and describe all the details of it .",
    "thus , the evolution of the code - writing process should reflect that of the simulated harmonic oscillator according to eqs ( [ e8])-([e10 ] ) .",
    "this is the meaning of saying that the right hand side of eq ( [ e8 ] ) , which represents the unpredictability of the code - writing process , should truly reflects the left hand side of it which represents the harmonic oscillator .",
    "a markov process @xcite in which @xmath68 does not correlate with its history is always assumed for these correlations .",
    "eq ( [ e10 ] ) is the probability that the ensemble is found at @xmath69 and @xmath70 with the harmonic oscillator code @xmath71 if at @xmath72 and @xmath73 it was at the similar @xmath74 .",
    "note that by the word code we do not necessarily mean the complete program of the harmonic oscillator , that is , we use this word even for a very small part of it .",
    "the probability for the entire interval that the ensemble is found at @xmath11 and @xmath2 to be with the same harmonic oscillator code @xmath55 if at the initial @xmath53 , @xmath75 it was at @xmath54 is @xcite @xmath76 in order to be able to solve the integrals in the former equation we first substitute from eq ( [ e9 ] ) into eq ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "thus , dividing the result by the infinitesimal interval @xmath77 , writing for @xmath78 the quantum mechanical potential energy @xmath79 with the eigenvalues @xmath80 @xmath81 and fourier transforming we obtain for eq ( [ e8 ] ) @xcite @xmath82 with the following gaussian constraints ( in which we denote the fourier transforms of @xmath83 and @xmath84 by @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively ) .",
    "@xmath87 in the following we write @xmath73 for @xmath88 . solving eq ( [ e12 ] ) for @xmath85",
    "one obtains @xcite @xmath89 from the last equation we obtain the correlation @xmath90 @xmath91 since we want our results to include a time dependence we fourier transform eq ( [ e14 ] ) back to obtain @xmath92 the former equations ( [ e12])-([e15 ] ) are for the subintervals @xmath59 and @xmath60 so that for obtaining the corresponding expression for the whole intervals @xmath17 and @xmath18 we use the following property of correlation functions @xcite that if @xmath93 then @xmath94 thus , the generalization of eq ( [ e15 ] ) to the entire intervals is @xmath95 eq ( [ e16 ] ) is the sought for probability to find at @xmath11 and @xmath2 the whole of the ensemble of @xmath56 programmers having the same harmonic oscillator code @xmath96 if at the initial @xmath53 and @xmath75 they all begin from @xmath54 which is the initial stage at which they begin to write their code . as remarked ,",
    "the stationary configuration is obtained in the limit of eliminating @xmath2 so equating all its different values to each other , as required by the sq method , one have @xmath97 note that the elimination of the variable @xmath2 is obtained by only equating all its different values to each other without having to take the infinity limit .",
    "figure 1 shows the correlation from eq ( [ e17 ] ) as a function of @xmath11 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "it begins from the value of 1.25 , which corresponds to the assigned values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , then steps through a maximum and vanishes for large @xmath11 .",
    "figure 2 shows a three - dimensional graph of the general correlation from eq ( [ e16 ] ) as function of @xmath11 and @xmath2 and for the same values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 as in figure 1 .",
    "note that for large @xmath2 the correlation vanishes even at those values of @xmath11 at which it attains its maximum in the stationary case of figure 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are typical values used for simulation purposes .",
    "note that the stationary state from eq ( [ e17 ] ) have been obtained by inserting the harmonic oscillator langevin expression from eq ( [ e12 ] ) into the action @xmath52 of each subinterval pair @xmath102 of each member of the ensemble .",
    "this kind of substitution is clearly seen in eq ( [ e10 ] ) which includes the langevin relation from ( [ e8 ] ) in each pair of subintervals @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "note that the substituted expressions of the harmonic oscillator into the actions of the subintervals are , of course , not identical since in this case the probability to write the same code by all the programmers is trivially unity .",
    "as one may realize from eq ( [ e16 ] ) the substituted expressions differ by @xmath2 and @xmath11 and only in the limit that these expressions have the same @xmath2 and @xmath11 that one finds the same code shared by all the ensemble members .",
    "as noted , the ultimate test of any simulation is that it correctly describe the simulated phenomena when the written code is run on the computer screen .",
    "thus , taking into account that the classical path integrals discussed here are formulated in the euclidean formalism @xcite in which the time @xmath11 is imaginary we see that the correlation from eq ( [ e17 ] ) is almost the same as that of the quantum harmonic oscillator which is @xcite @xmath103 thus , as remarked , introducing into the numerical code of the harmonic oscillator all the detailed description of the real one we obtain the correct simulation as seen from comparing eq ( [ e17 ] ) to ( [ e18 ] ) .",
    "moreover , when the remarked substitutions of the harmonic oscillator relation is performed in a dense manner over very short intervals of @xmath11 and @xmath2 , in which case the substituted expressions are almost identical , one may obtain the situation in which all the members of the ensemble write exactly the same code and , therefore , the correlation ( [ e17 ] ) becomes large . in such case @xmath7 becomes very large and may be written as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the time difference of each of the @xmath56 subintervals .",
    "thus , eq ( [ e17 ] ) becomes @xmath106 from the last equation one realizes that if the condition @xmath107 is satisfied then the correlation among the ensemble members is maximal because each of them writes exactly the same code so the mentioned probability is unity",
    ". note that in this case not only the @xmath2 intervals tends to zero but also the @xmath11 s as seen from the former equations . in this case",
    "the left hand side of eq ( [ e20 ] ) becomes almost unity ( for not very large values of @xmath101 ) and thus for having a probability of unity one have @xmath108 ( keeping the former value of @xmath98 ) .",
    "we see from the former section that substituting the harmonic oscillator expression into the actions @xmath52 of the path integrals @xcite which are related to the large ensemble of programmers establishes it among them in the sense that the probability to find them writing the same program which represents the harmonic oscillator is large .",
    "we show this again for the example of a two - state electron which emits a photon and then reabsorbs it where the total energy is not conserved .",
    "we assume , as for the harmonic oscillator example , that there are a large number of different numerical codes of this process which reflect the large number of different ways which lead to the same simulation .",
    "thus , as for the harmonic oscillator case , we introduce a large ensemble of programmers all of them want to simulate this electron - photon interaction upon their computer screens . as in the former section the differences among the written programs may be related to the different values of the extra variable @xmath2 . and , as for the harmonic oscillator case ,",
    "the equilibrium state is obtained when all the different values of @xmath2 are equated to each other and taken to infinity .",
    "we subdivide the intervals @xmath18 and @xmath17 , during which this process occurs , into a large number of subintervals @xmath22 , @xmath109 ,  @xmath110 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 ,  , @xmath111 and formulate the appropriate expression for the described electron - photon interaction over the representative subintervals @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we calculate the probability to find the ensemble of programmers writing the same code which truly simulates the remarked electron - photon interaction .",
    "we find it better to discuss now this probability using the fokker - plank equation @xcite .",
    "that is , we begin from @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 is given by eq ( [ e10 ] ) and denotes the probability to find the relevant ensemble of programmers at @xmath114 and @xmath70 having the code @xmath115 if at the former @xmath72 and @xmath73 they have the code @xmath74 .",
    "note that , as in the harmonic oscillator example , the word code does not necessarily means the complete program of this process , that is , even a very small part of it is called code .",
    "the operator @xmath116 is @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the `` stochastic '' hamiltonian and momentum respectively and @xmath29 is as discussed after eq ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "the momentum operator @xmath119 is defined as in quantum mechanics @xcite @xmath120 , and its commutation with the operator @xmath121 satisfy @xcite @xmath122= 2\\alpha \\delta_{ki}$ ] , where all one have to do in order to obtain the quantum regime is to set @xcite @xmath123 . from the former relations",
    "one may develop , as has been done in @xcite , an operator formalism similar to that of quantum mechanics , especially , the corresponding `` schroedinger '' , `` heisenberg '' and `` interaction '' pictures .    using the former discussion we find the conditional probability to find at @xmath2 and @xmath11 the ensemble having the code @xmath124 if at the initial @xmath75 and @xmath53 they have the code @xmath54 .",
    "that is , one can write this probability in the `` interaction '' picture for the intervals @xmath125 , and @xmath126 @xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the probability to find the system at the initial @xmath53 and @xmath75 with the code @xmath54 which probably contains at the initial stage only a few bits and the superscript @xmath129 denotes that we consider the `` interaction '' picture . note that @xmath48 depends upon @xmath2 and @xmath11 so the integral with respect to @xmath48 is , actually , a double one over @xmath2 and @xmath11 . substituting , in a perturbative manner @xcite for @xmath130 on the right hand side of eq ( [ e23 ] ) one obtains @xmath131 we , now , follow the same rules in @xcite , except for the introduction of the variable @xmath2 , for representing the electron and photon before and after their interaction .",
    "the extra variable @xmath2 is introduced into the relevant quantities so that in the limit of @xmath132 , as required in the sq method @xcite , the known expressions @xcite which represent the electron and photon are obtained .",
    "we note first that the probability @xmath133 is no other than the _ state _ of the system @xcite ( as in quantum mechanics the system states of the sq theory have also a probabilistic character ) . thus , in the former equations we may assign to the initial @xmath75 and @xmath53 the value of zero and refer to @xmath134 as the initial state of the ensemble system .",
    "this initial common state denotes , as for the harmonic oscillator case discussed in the former section , the common starting point of all the ensemble programmers which simulate the electron - photon interaction .    as remarked , the electron is assumed to have two different states so that at @xmath135 and @xmath136 it was at the higher state 2 from which it descends to the lower one 1 through emitting a photon .",
    "then at @xmath137 and @xmath138 it reabsorbs the photon and returns to state 2 as schematically shown at the left hand side of figure 3 . the incoming electron and the emitted photon at @xmath135 and @xmath136 may be represented by @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively , where @xmath141 is an infinitesimal satisfying @xmath142 , and @xmath143 , ( @xmath144 is a constant ) @xcite .",
    "this is done so that in the equilibrium configuration , which is obtained in the sq theory when @xmath132 , the terms in @xmath2 vanish as required @xcite and one remains only with those in @xmath11 as in @xcite .",
    "the outgoing electron after emission at @xmath135 and @xmath136 may be represented by the plane wave @xmath145 where the @xmath141 has the same meaning as before . at the reabsorption stage at @xmath137 and",
    "@xmath138 the electron is represented , before absorbing the photon , by @xmath146 and after the absorption by @xmath147 .",
    "the photon is represented at the reabsorption stage by @xmath148 .",
    "also , the emission itself , denoted by the vertex in figure 3 , may be represented , as in the quantum analog @xcite , by @xmath149 and the reabsorption by @xmath150 , where an explicit expressions for @xmath149 and @xmath150 may be obtained in an equivalent manner to their quantum analogs ( see @xcite ) , but these expression are not required for the discussion here .",
    "thus , since the final state at @xmath11 and @xmath2 after the reabsorption of the photon is the same as the initial one before its emission we may write for the relevant @xmath133 at the end of the whole process of emission and reabsorption @xcite @xmath151 the coefficient @xmath152 denotes the mentioned evolution from the initial state @xmath128 to the final one @xmath153 and is found as in @xcite which discusses the same process in quantum terms ( without using the variable @xmath2 ) .",
    "we first note that the entire interaction of ( emission@xmath154reabsorption ) in the variables @xmath11 and @xmath2 , which is described after eq ( [ e24 ] ) , may be written as a sum of two separate terms @xmath155 and @xmath156 each of them involves only one variable .",
    "these two terms are @xmath157 where we have set , as remarked , @xmath158 .",
    "each of the two expressions @xmath155 and @xmath156 is , actually , an account of the whole process of emision and reabsorption , as discussed after eq ( [ e24 ] ) , in the respective variables @xmath11 and @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath152 from eq ( [ e25 ] ) is given by the sum @xmath159 so that in the equilibrium state obtained in the limit in which all the values of @xmath2 are equated to each other the term @xmath156 vanishes and remains only the term @xmath155 as should be @xcite .",
    "this is because we have already equated the initial @xmath75 to zero so for equating all the other @xmath2 s to each other one have to set also the other values of @xmath2 equal to zero which causes @xmath156 to vanish ( see the second of eqs ( [ e26 ] ) ) .",
    "thus @xmath160 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{\\lambda_s } \\frac{g_{\\lambda_s}g^+_{\\lambda_s } } { i(\\epsilon_1-\\epsilon_2-w_{\\lambda_s}+ i\\delta(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda } ) ) } [ \\frac{(e^{i2\\delta ( \\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda})s}-1 ) } { i2\\delta(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda})}- \\nonumber \\\\ & &   -(\\frac{(\\exp(i(\\epsilon_2- \\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda}+i\\delta(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda}))s)-1 ) } { i(\\epsilon_2-\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda_s}+ i\\delta(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda } ) ) } ) ] \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first quotient in the square parentheses of the second sum , which is of the kind @xmath161 , may be evaluated , using lhospital theorem @xcite , to obtain for it the result of @xmath2 so that eq ( [ e27 ] ) becomes @xmath162 +   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{\\lambda_s } \\frac{g_{\\lambda_s}g^+_{\\lambda_s } } { i(\\epsilon_1-\\epsilon_2-w_{\\lambda_s}+i\\delta(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda } ) ) } [ s-   \\label{e28 } \\\\ & & - ( \\frac{(\\exp(i(\\epsilon_2- \\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda}+i\\delta(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda}))s)-1 ) } { i(\\epsilon_2-\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda_s}+i\\delta(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda } ) ) } ) ] \\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last expression for @xmath152 yields terms of several kinds among them those which are proportional to @xmath11 and @xmath2 , others which are oscillatory in these variables , and also constant terms .",
    "thus , for large @xmath11 and @xmath2 the oscillatory as well as the constant terms may be neglected compared to @xmath11 and @xmath2 as in the analogous quantum discussion of the same process @xcite .",
    "substituting the resulting expression in eq ( [ e25 ] ) one obtains @xmath163 where , @xmath164 the result in eq ( [ e29 ] ) is only for the first - order term in eq ( [ e24 ] ) .",
    "if all the higher order terms of this process are taken into account one obtains , analogously to the quantum analog ( in which the variable @xmath2 is absent ) , the result @xmath165 the right hand side of figure 3 shows the diagram of the fourth order term of this process .",
    "now , as required by the sq theory , the stationary situations are obtained in the limit of eliminating the extra variable @xmath2 which is done by equating all the @xmath2 values to each other and taking to infinity .",
    "thus , since , as remarked , we have equated the initial @xmath75 to zero we must equate all the other @xmath2 values to zero .",
    "that is , the stationary state is @xmath166 the last result is the one obtained in quantum field theory @xcite for the same interaction of ( emission@xmath154reabsorption ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath167 , given by the first of eqs ( [ e30 ] ) , has the same form also in the quantum version @xcite , where it is termed the energy shift .",
    "this shift have been experimentally demonstrated in the quantum field theory for the case of a real many - state particle in the famous lamb shift of the hydrogen atom @xcite .    as remarked ,",
    "this electron - photon interaction is discussed in the literature @xcite without using any extra variable and the result at the right hand side of eq ( [ e32 ] ) is obtained .",
    "this result have been obtained here by discussing the simulation process of the electron - photon interaction , that is , by using the extra variable @xmath2 in the limit of equating all its values . in other words , as for the harmonic oscillator case , introducing the expression of the detailed electron - photon interaction into all the relevant codes ( into the subintervals of @xmath2 and @xmath11 of all the programmers ) yields a correlation among them which truly represents the corelation of the real interaction .",
    "thus , as for the harmonic oscillator example in which the use of the sq method and the extra variable @xmath2 lead to the real known quantum correlation ( compare the two equations ( [ e17 ] ) , ( [ e18 ] ) ) , so also here we obtain , using the same method and extra variable , the known expression for the probability @xmath168 . also , the writing stage of the relevant programs , which is characterized by the different versions of the code , is represented by the last result of eq ( [ e31 ] ) ( the analogous writing stage of the harmonic oscillator example is given by eq ( [ e16 ] ) ) .",
    "the equilibrium stage corresponds to the case where all the values of @xmath2 are equated to each other as seen from eq ( [ e32 ] ) in which all the @xmath2 s , including the initial @xmath75 ( see the discussion after eqs ( [ e24 ] ) and ( [ e31 ] ) ) , are assigned the value of zero .",
    "the analogous expression for the harmonic oscillator example is given by eq ( [ e17 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding similarities between the correlations for the two cases are , as remarked , the ultimate tests which show that the relevant simulations truly represent the simulated phenomena .",
    "we have discussed the code - writing stage of the numerical simulations of real phenomena using physical terms and terminology .",
    "the method applied for discussing this code - writing stage is the stochatic quantization method of parisi - wu - namiki @xcite where an extra variable is introduced that takes account of an assumed stochastic process ( in this variable ) which allows a large number of possible different behaviours of the system .",
    "the equilibrium configuration is obtained @xcite when this variable is eliminated through equating all its different values to each other and taking to infinity .",
    "this equating of all the possible @xmath2 values to each other introduces an element of repetitions of the same process through which the system is stabilized and brought to its equilibrium configuration .",
    "we discuss the system of a large ensemble of programmers which all try to simulate the same phenomena by writing the appropriate code which naturally will not be the same for all of them .",
    "the mentioned equating of all the @xmath2 values means that all of them write the same code and this constitutes a repetition of of writing the same program so that the probability to see the same numerical simulation is obviously large .",
    "we note that obtaining numerical equilibrium configuration through running a large number of times the related code upon the computer screen is the main characterstic of many simulations processes especially those concerned with finding numerical solutions of physical situations .",
    "for example , any one who try to numerically solve any differential equation which governs the evolution of some physical system knows , as shown in the following , that the solution suggested by the computer is obtained only after repeatedly updating the given differential equation .",
    "better statistics is obtained when the number of iterations grows since this increases also the number of samples .",
    "the advantage of these repetitions is clearly seen for the case of simulating the long range correlation functions @xcite for which the conventional monte carlo simulation methods to numerically simulate them , using path integrals , fails @xcite .",
    "it has been shown explicitly by parisi @xcite , and namiki _ et al _ @xcite , using sq methods , that the following two point connected correlation function @xcite @xmath169q_le^{-s_h}}{\\int d[q]e^{-s_h}})|_{h=0}=   \\frac{1}{h}(<\\!q_l\\!>_h-<\\!q_l\\ !",
    "> ) + o(h),\\ ] ] where the action @xmath170 involves a small external additional term @xmath171 , may be solved by replacing the ensemble averages with and without the small external source @xmath172 and @xmath173 respectively by the time averages calculated from the following langevin equations @xmath174 @xmath175 the @xmath176 and @xmath177 are independent and assumed to satisfy @xmath178 solving the right hand side of eq ( [ e47 ] ) generally results in a large statistical error @xcite , so parisi @xcite uses the same random forces in eqs ( [ e48 ] ) , ( [ e49 ] ) , that is , @xmath179 which reduces considerably the statistical error as shown in @xcite ( see the appendix there ) .",
    "thus , in order to be able to simulate and obtain the long range correlation functions one must equate to each other not only all the different values of @xmath2 which are related to @xmath176 and @xmath180 but also to equate @xmath176 to @xmath180 so that in the stationary limit one obtains , as remarked , the sought - for simulations .",
    "but as noted by namiki _",
    "et al _ @xcite the last method , although works well for the fixed potential and the @xmath181 model @xcite , breaks down when one uses it to obtain the long range correlation function for the @xmath182 model possibly due to its large degree of nonlinearity .",
    "this situation is avoided in @xcite by initiating a new round of repetitions where each one begins from the final configuration of the former . that is , in order to improve the statistical results one have first , as remarked , to increase the number of samples which is obtained by parallel updating of eqs ( [ e48 ] ) , ( [ e49 ] ) without and with the external source respectively using the same random forces for @xmath176 and @xmath183 .",
    "these steps which are sufficient , as remarked , for the fixed potential and the @xmath181 models end in a breakdown of the simulation for the @xmath182 model when the updating process continues .",
    "thus , one must @xcite stop this updating before break - down occurs and restart the whole procedure from switching again the external source and updating eqs ( [ e48 ] ) , ( [ e49 ] ) starting from the last stopped configuration as the initial one of the new round of updating .",
    "in other words , by only repeating the switching and the updating process one obtains , numerically , the sought - for long range correlation functions for the @xmath182 model .    moreover , it has been shown @xcite , that these repetitions not only lead to numerical stabilization",
    "but when they are really performed ( not just through clicking upon the computer keyboard ) lead to a real stabilization .",
    "this phenomenon , termed the zeno effect , have been validated both theoretically @xcite , and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic of this effect is the preservation , through a large number of repetitions of the same measurement , of an initial state of the sytem @xcite , or _ guiding _ it through a prescribed path of evolution , from a large number of possible paths @xcite .",
    "the principle of repetition have been shown in section 3 for the harmonic oscillator example ( see eqs ( [ e16])-([e17 ] ) and the discussion there ) where we see that when the same version of program is shared among the ensemble members then the probability to find the same simulation of the harmonic oscillator in all the screens is large . moreover , when the number of times of performing this simulation , which is related to the number of subintervals ( see the discussion after eq ( [ e16 ] ) ) of the finite total paths in @xmath2 and @xmath11 of each member of the ensemble , becomes large so that the duration of each is small then the remarked probability is unity ( see eqs ( [ e19])-([e20 ] ) ) .",
    "this is so since each member of the ensemble have in this case exactly the same code related to the harmonic oscillator and the correlation among them is , therefore , maximal .",
    "the same state of affairs have been found also for the energy shift example discussed in section 4 . in this case",
    "the required correlation is obtained through summing the relevant feynman diagram to all orders .",
    "this influence of repeating the same experiment a large number of times have been shown to be effective also for classical systems @xcite .",
