    "recent development of string theory has shown that noncommutative ( nc ) models can arise in certain limits of string theory @xcite . moreover",
    "the string field theory @xcite , which is the theory of second quantised string , is based on noncommutative geometry too .",
    "due to their proximity to string theory noncommutative theories have many features in common with it .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention the ir / uv mixing @xcite , which says that in nc theories there is a correspondence analogous to string theory between contributions at high energies with those at low ones .",
    "another common feature is a number of equivalences / dualities which relate different noncommutative models @xcite .",
    "this list is continued by the so called noncommutative soliton which was found in @xcite , in the limit of large noncommutativity @xmath0 and further generalised to finite @xmath1 but nontrivial gauge field background @xcite .",
    "these solitons are believed to correspond in the string theory language to _ branes .",
    "_    noncommutative theories can alternatively be treated as theories of linear operators defined over a ( infinite - dimensional separable ) hilbert space . in the operator language",
    ", noncommutative solitons look like projectors to finite - dimensional subspaces of the hilbert space , while the gauge fields split into parts corresponding respectively to the finite dimensional subspace and its orthogonal completion @xcite .    in this note",
    "we are going to consider gauge field `` solitons '' , i.e. solutions for gauge fields which are projectors to finite - dimensional subspaces of the hilbert space rather than ones for the scalar field . for more details the reader",
    "is referred to ref . @xcite .",

    "mills(higgs ) model in the temporal gauge @xmath7 in a sense we explain below @xcite .",
    "this appears also to be the same with the bosonic part of the hilbert space i.e. @xmath8 bfss m(atrix ) model @xcite .",
    "equations of motion corresponding to this action look as follows , @xmath9=0.\\ ] ] one may find static classical solution @xmath10 , @xcite , satisfying , @xmath11={\\mathrm{i}}\\theta_{ij}^{-1},\\ ] ] for which we assume irreducibility , i.e. any quantity @xmath12 commuting with all @xmath13 : @xmath14=0 $ ] have to be proportional to unity operator . in particular , @xmath15 should be nondegenerate .",
    "this property ensures that any operator can be formally expressed as an operator function of of the operators @xmath16 , by means of its weyl symbol .",
    "expanding fluctuations around this solution , @xmath17 , and weyl ordering operators @xmath18 with respect to @xmath19 one gets precisely the @xmath20-dimensional noncommutative yang ",
    "mills model for the fields @xmath21 .",
    "weyl symbol @xmath22 of an operator @xmath23 can be treated as an ordinary function subject to the moyal or star product , @xmath24 here @xmath22 and @xmath25 are weyl symbols of some operators @xmath23 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the weyl symbol of their product and @xmath28 , @xmath29 denote the derivatives with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath30 .",
    "integration of a weyl symbol corresponds to @xmath31trace of the respective operator .",
    "an important difference of the weyl ",
    "moyal algebra of functions defined above from the commutative one ( of course , beyond its noncommutativity ) is that the derivative is an internal automorphism of the algebra .",
    "the partial derivative with respect to @xmath19 here corresponds to the commutator , @xmath32(x),\\ ] ]    getting another solution with a smaller number of independent operators say @xmath33 , @xmath34 , expanding and weyl ordering fluctuations around it , one gets yang  mills  higgs model in a smaller number of dimensions equal to @xmath35 , the number of independent irreducible operators . in the remaining part of this note we will actually consider the model corresponding to the expansion around a two - dimensional solution , @xmath36={\\mathrm{i}}\\theta^{-1},\\ ] ] but one should keep in mind the above equivalence .",
    "in this section we review a completely different class of localised solutions . in order to do this consider the noncommutative analog of complex coordinates which is given by oscillator rising / lowering operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39=1,\\ ] ] and the oscillator basis , @xmath40    there is a solution to different from one discussed in the previous section which is given by commutative matrices . due to commutativity",
    "they can be diagonalised by a proper gauge transformation and represented in the oscillator basis as follows , @xmath41 where @xmath42 represents @xmath43-th eigenvalue of the ( finite rank ) operator @xmath3 .",
    "the rank @xmath44 of the solution is called the `` soliton number '' .",
    "the simplest one - soliton solutions can be written in the form , @xmath45    _ we should warn that the term `` soliton '' applied to the above configuration is conventional . it is not a soliton in the sense of solutions to the solitonic equations .",
    "moreover , in this case the solution has zero energy at rest , however geometrically it is `` noncommutative soliton '' in the sense of @xcite . in this particular case one",
    "also can call them `` vacuum solitons '' or just `` vacua '' .",
    "_    in the star - product form operator is represented by the weyl symbol @xmath46 the soliton shifted along noncommutative plane by a ( c - number ) vector @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 its weyl symbol , correspondingly , is given by @xmath49 .",
    "the shifted soliton with constant @xmath47 is a solution again .",
    "when @xmath47 becomes time - dependent one can perform a gauge transformation @xmath50 which shifts the soliton back to the centre , but produce a kinetic term @xmath51 .",
    "thus a single noncommutative soliton moves like a free _ non - relativistic _ particle .",
    "it is also stable since its energy at rest is zero .    in what follows we are going to analyse the situation when there is a couple of solitons separated by a distance @xmath47 .",
    "a single noncommutative soliton can be always rotated in the hilbert space by a gauge transformation to have the `` polarisation '' @xmath52 and `` orientation '' along @xmath53 . when there are two such solitons one can choose _ without loss of generality _ the `` orientation '' to involve nontrivially only @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "consider two solitons which are obtained from @xmath55 by shifts along the noncommutative plane by respectively @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "since the dynamics of the centre is free and can be decoupled by a time - dependent gauge transformation similar to , where @xmath58 is the coordinate of the centre .",
    "the coordinates of the solitons reduced to the centre become @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the configuration we consider looks like ,    [ 2solit ] @xmath60    where we introduced the shorthand notations , @xmath61 the hight @xmath62 can be absorbed by the rescaling of the coupling and the time , therefore we put it to @xmath63 .    in what follows also @xmath64 @xmath4 will enter trivially in the equation , so in the remaining part of the paper we simply neglect them and allow the index @xmath65 to run in the range @xmath66 .",
    "if we were considering more than two noncommutative solitons we would have to keep more fields .",
    "the symmetry of the model allows its further simplification . in particular",
    ", the gauss law conservation , @xmath67 provided by the unitary gauge invariance , implies that operators @xmath64 are nontrivial only on a two - dimensional subspace @xmath68 of the hilbert space spanned by @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , one can restrict the equations of motion to @xmath68 assuming thus that @xmath64 are 2@xmath702 matrices acting on it .",
    "this model has a number of interesting features studied in @xcite .",
    "the motion resulting from above equations appears to be _",
    "stochastic _ for all values of @xmath47 except @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath74 the motion is periodic but unstable , infinitesimal deviation from this position brings it back to stochasticity .",
    "the solution to initial equations is expressed in terms of solution @xmath75 and @xmath76 to eq .",
    "as follows , @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the weyl symbols of the two - dimensional pauli matrices which form the basis for hermitian operators acting on @xmath68 ,      qualitatively , the solution , describes lumps bouncing ( stochastically ) around `` points '' @xmath80 of the noncommutative plane . in the string theory language",
    "the heights of the lumps can be interpreted as transversal ( to the noncommutative 2-brane ) coordinates of two 0-branes .",
