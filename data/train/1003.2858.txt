    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are luminous in wide wavelength because of the vast amount of energy produced by accretion onto a central supermassive blackhole .",
    "accordingly , they are observable at nearly entire wavelength despite locating at great distances , and have been searched in various wavelengths : e.g. , optical @xcite , infrared @xcite , or radio @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission is especially a characteristic property of agns .",
    "the vast majority of x - ray sources are agns and all classes of agns appear in x - ray surveys .",
    "there are many studies that collect agn samples using x - ray data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , whether an object is a x - ray source can be a criterion to select agns .",
    "colour selection is a powerful technique in extracting agn candidates .",
    "a classical method is known as the @xmath1-excess ( uvx ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which extract bluer quasars .",
    "@xcite selected quasars via their nonstellar colours using sdss photometry .",
    "other selections are such as red quasar survey using optical and near - infrared combined colours @xcite , or mid - infrared selected agns using spitzer data @xcite .",
    "colour selection using near - infrared photometry has also performed by some previous studies .",
    "@xcite extracted obscured agn candidates using the colour selection of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 method using the excess in k - band , proposed by @xcite , was used for extracting quasars @xcite .",
    "however , these extracted only peculiar agns ( in the former case ) or extracted agns using combined with optical photometry ( in the latter case ) . because the optical light suffers more extinctions than the infrared light and an agn is surrounded by a dust torus , a selection using optical and near - infrared combined colours may miss agns ( especially obscured agns ) , because of lack of optical detection .",
    "however , @xcite proposed colour selection criteria to extract agns using only near - infrared colours .",
    "they demonstrated by both observed and simulated colours that agns are differentiated from several types of objects in a @xmath4-@xmath5 colour - colour diagram ( ccd ) .",
    "this enables us to extract agn candidates using only near - infrared photometry .    in this paper , we first extract bright sources in both near - infrared and x - ray by a cross - identification between the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and rosat all - sky survey catalogues , and select agn candidates on the basis of the near - infrared colour selection criteria proposed by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we investigate properties of candidates using not only near - infrared and x - ray data but also photometric data at other wavelengths derived by cross - identifications with some catalogues . in section [ data ] , we introduce the 2mass and rosat . in section [ extraction ] , we describe the method to extract agn candidates ( including the criteria of both cross - identification and colour selection ) and the results . in section [ properties ] , properties of agn candidates are investigated by photometric data at near - infrared , x - ray , and other wavelengths .",
    "the 2mass @xcite is a project that observed 99.998% of the whole sky at j ( 1.25 @xmath6 m ) , h ( 1.65 @xmath6 m ) , ks ( 2.16 @xmath6 m ) bands , at mt .",
    "hopkins , az ( in the northern hemisphere ) and at ctio , chile ( in the southern hemisphere ) between 1997 june and 2001 february .",
    "the instruments are both highly automated 1.3-m telescopes equipped with three - channel cameras , each channel consisting of a 256 @xmath7 256 array of hgcdte detectors .",
    "the 2mass obtained 4,121,439 fits images ( pixel size @xmath8 ) with 7.8 s of integration time .",
    "the limiting magnitudes ( signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n)@xmath910 ) are 15.8 ( j ) , 15.1 ( h ) , 14.3 ( k@xmath10 ) mag at each band .",
    "the point source catalogue ( psc ) was produced using these images and catalogued 470,992,970 sources . in the 2mass web site ,",
    "the images and the psc are open to the public and are easily available .",
    "the rosat is an x - ray astronomical satellite launched in 1990 . during six months",
    "soon after the launching , all - sky imaging survey in the energy range of @xmath11kev was performed with a x - ray reflector equipped with position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) .",
    "a limiting pspc count - rate is @xmath12 cts s@xmath13 .",
    "this is the first imaging survey in the x - ray wavelength .",
    "the survey has yielded bright source catalogue ( bsc ) and faint source catalogue ( fsc ) , and they contain 18,806 and 105,926 sources , respectively , with positional error of @xmath14 . both catalogues have already been open to the public and available on the web . in this paper , we use both bsc and fsc .",
    "we cross - identified rosat catalogues with the 2mass psc to extract a near - infrared counterpart for a x - ray source .",
    "we set a positional criterion of @xmath0 , that is , we treat as a near - infrared counterpart when a 2mass source is within @xmath15 of a rosat source . as a result of the cross - identification",
    ", we extracted 46,205 ( 217,033 ) sources .",
    "even though several 2mass sources may be located within @xmath15 of a rosat source , we treated them as counterparts for the x - ray source .",
    "accordingly , in the positional criterion of @xmath0 , many objects are miss - identified due to the difference of angular resolutions .",
    "therefore , we further imposed colour selection criteria to extract reliable counterparts .",
    "the difference between positional accuracies causes mis - identification on a cross - identification .",
    "therefore , another criterion is required for accurately extracting a counterpart .",
    "@xcite presented stellar locus in a near - infrared ( @xmath16)-(@xmath17 ) ccd .",
    "because most 2mass sources are galactic normal stars , mis - identified sources should be located around the stellar locus in the near - infrared ccd .",
    "@xcite investigated near - infrared colours of quasars / agns and demonstrated that the locus of quasars / agns are differentiated from the stellar locus in the near - infrared ccd .",
    "they also proposed near - infrared colour selection criteria for extracting agns : @xmath18 @xmath19 we adopted these criteria for extracting reliable agn candidates from the cross - identified sources . before the near - infrared colour selection , we extracted the sources having photometric quality flags in the 2mass psc superior to b ( corresponding to @xmath20 ) .",
    "samples were reduced to 27,058 ( 121,767 ) sources .",
    "we subsequently extracted agn candidates on the basis of the near - infrared colour selection criteria .",
    "because most sources with @xmath21 are probably normal stars , we further ruled out such sources ( i.e. , extracted only sources with @xmath22 ) .",
    "finally , we have extracted 5,273 ( 10,701 ) sources as agn candidates in the bsc ( fsc ) . to confirm that candidates have been already known , we checked the following agn catalogues : @xcite .",
    "table [ agn - catalogues ] shows the number of identified sources in each catalogue .",
    "of 5,273 ( 10,071 ) candidates , 2,053 ( 1,008 ) sources have been already known as agns .",
    "it is highly probable that remaining 3,220 ( 9,693 ) sources are unknown agns .",
    "below , we consider the reliability of agn candidates by investigating properties of them .    [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     agns are known to have variability across wide wavelength ranges from radio to x - ray or @xmath23-ray @xcite . here , we investigate variability of agn candidates in the near - infrared wavelength , by comparing magnitudes between 2mass and denis .",
    "figure [ mag - deltamag ] shows @xmath24-@xmath25 and @xmath26-@xmath27 diagrams , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we also plotted photometric differences of normal stars for referring to typical difference between 2mass and denis photometric systems .",
    "sample stars are taken from @xmath30 area , whose near - infrared colours are consistent with those of normal stars in @xcite .",
    "we note that the sample stars have photometric quality flags in both 2mass and denis catalogues superior to b ( @xmath20 ) and 90 , respectively .",
    "the denis photometry is transformed into the 2mass photometry on the basis of @xcite .",
    "standard deviations @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the sample stars are 0.08 and 0.20 , respectively . as seen in the diagrams ,",
    "there are several sources clearly showing variability . table [ variability - list ] summarizes the number of candidates showing variability larger than @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in our sample , percentages of candidates with variability in the fsc are relatively smaller than those in the bsc .",
    "faint agns at the x - ray possibly show less variability .",
    "we note that , practically , there should be more sources with variability because we could compare only double - epoch magnitudes .",
    "figure [ krad - xrad - ccd ] shows flux ratios @xmath35 versus @xmath36 diagram .",
    "significant differences between known agns and unclassified sources can not be clearly seen in each diagram .",
    "there appears to be correlations between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the diagrams .",
    "we performed least square fittings for the distributions of both known agns and unclassified sources .",
    "the least square fitting lines are also shown in the diagrams .",
    "still , there is no significant difference between known agns and unclassified sources in each diagram , although in the @xmath39 @xmath40 for the bsc there is small difference in slope .",
    "it is known that there is a correlation between luminosity ratios @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "correlations in our sample may be a variant of such correlations .",
    "because unclassified sources have similar properties with known agns in the diagrams , these properties also support that unclassified sources are agns .",
    "we have cross - identified the 2mass psc with rosat catalogues , and have extracted agn candidates on the basis of the near - infrared colour selection . of 5,273 ( 10,701 )",
    "agn candidates in the bsc ( fsc ) , 3,220 ( 9,693 ) are unclassified sources .",
    "we investigated their properties using near - infrared , x - ray , optical , and radio data .",
    "overall , most unclassified sources in the bsc have similar properties with known agns and their properties are also consistent with previous studies , whereas some unclassified sources , especially those in the fsc , have properties different from known agns .",
    "it is highly probable that most unclassified sources are agns because of the following reasons .",
    "first , our candidates are x - ray sources .",
    "the fact that a object is a x - ray source supports the object is an agn because it is believed that the vast majority of x - ray sources are agns .",
    "second , our candidates satisfy the near - infrared colour selection criteria proposed by @xcite , that is , they have properties in near - infrared colours similar to those of agns .",
    "third , some candidates have been already known agns and not only unclassified sources show properties similar to those of known agns but also their properties in multiwavelength are consistent with previous studies .",
    "however , it should be noted that there may be relatively large number of contamination in unclassified fsc sources . to confirm that they are real agns ,",
    "spectroscopic observations are required .",
    "similar works using a cross - identification with a rosat catalogue were performed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite extracted a sample of 14,708 extragalactic iras sources on the basis of a supervised selection whose selection quality was assessed by @xcite , and they cross - identified between the sample and the first processing of the rosat all - sky survey data .",
    "the cross - identified 244 iras galaxies comprised infrared luminous nearby galaxies , spirals and ellipticals , seyfert galaxies , and qsos .",
    "they investigated properties of the cross - identified sources using x - ray , far - infrared , and optical fluxes , and found some correlations between them .",
    "the work in @xcite is also similar to that in @xcite , which cross - indentified the 14,315 iras galaxies with the second processing of the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "these studies are similar to our study in that a rosat catalogue is cross - identified with an infrared catalogue . however , whereas these studies investigated extragalactic sources extracted by a mid- and far - infrared colour selection , we investigated agn candidates extracted by the near - infrared colour selection .",
    "the number of sample is also totally different .",
    "in addition , we discussed not only properties in infrared and x - ray but also near - infrared variability and radio properties , which are not discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper extracted several thousands of agn candidates across the entire sky .",
    "the use of only near - infrared colours enables us to search for agn candidates across the entire sky . when using this technique on other deep near - infrared surveys such as denis , ukidss , and future surveys , many agns , which have not been detected in the optical wavelength , can be extracted .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
