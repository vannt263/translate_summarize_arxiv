    "electrical detection of ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) in ferromagnets ( fm ) is a powerful new experimental tool which has transformed the research on spin and magnetization dynamics .",
    "@xcite over the past few years , this technique has generated a great deal of interest in the communities of magnetism , spintronics , and microwave technologies .",
    "it has been broadly applied for studying diverse material structures , ranging from ferromagnetic thin films such as py ( permalloy , ni@xmath0fe@xmath1),@xcite , cro@xmath2,@xcite fe@xmath3o@xmath4,@xcite single crystal fe,@xcite gamnas,@xcite and la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath3,@xcite bilayer devices such as py / pt,@xcite py / au,@xcite py / gaas,@xcite and y@xmath3fe@xmath7o@xmath8/pt,@xcite to a variety of magnetic tunneling junctions ( mtj ) based on magnetic multilayers.@xcite from a technical standpoint , its high sensitivity has made it possible to quantitatively determine spin boundary conditions@xcite and to directly measure non - linear magnetization damping@xcite , the quasiparticle mass for the domain wall@xcite , the phase diagram of the the spin - transfer driven dynamics@xcite and various kinds of parametric spin wave excitation @xcite . its capability to probe the interplay of spins , charges , and photons has been utilized for studying spin rectification@xcite , spin pumping@xcite , spin torque@xcite , and spin hall effects@xcite , which have led to the proposing and realization of novel dynamic spintronic devices such as the spin battery,@xcite spin diode,@xcite spin dynamo,@xcite and spin demodulator @xcite . very recently , its ability to detect coherent processes@xcite has enabled electrical probing of the spin - resonance phase and the relative phase of electromagnetic waves@xcite , which pave new ways for microwave sensing@xcite , non - destructive imaging,@xcite and dielectric spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "such a coherent capability is especially exciting as it resembles the latest achievement in semiconductor spintronics , where a new platform for coherent optical control of spin / charge currents has been developed by using nonresonant quantum interferences .",
    "@xcite    from the physical standpoint , many different effects may generate a time - independent dc voltage in magnetic materials via the fmr .",
    "reported mechanisms involve spin rectification@xcite , spin pumping@xcite , spin torque@xcite , spin diode@xcite , spin hall@xcite and inverse spin hall effects@xcite .",
    "two major issues stand out here : ( 1 ) a unified picture clarifying the relations and distinctions between such diverse mechanisms has not been established , which leads to increasing controversy and confusion in interpreting and understanding experimental results .",
    "a stunning example of this issue is found in the very recent studies of the spin hall effect via electrically detected fmr , where two similar experiments performed on similar devices were interpreted completely differently.@xcite ( 2 ) when more than one mechanism simultaneously plays a role in the fmr generated dc voltage , proper interpretation requires a quantitative analysis of the fmr line shape . in our opinion",
    ", this has remained the `` achilles heel '' in recent studies of spin pumping and the spin hall effect which utilize electrically detected fmr .",
    "the purpose of this article is to address these two critical issues with a brief review of the key physics of this subject , followed by systematically measured experimental data with detailed theoretical analysis .",
    "this paper is split into three main sections .",
    "first we provide a brief review of different mechanisms which may generate the photovoltage via the fmr .",
    "then we use the dynamic susceptibility obtained from a solution of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation to derive analytical formulae for analyzing the line shape and the symmetry properties of the photovoltage generated through spin rectification .",
    "finally we present experimental results measured from different samples , at different frequencies , and in different experimental configurations , showing that the fmr line shape is determined by the relative phase of microwaves which is sample and frequency dependent .",
    "[ t ]    under microwave excitation at angular frequency @xmath9 , the rf electric ( @xmath10 ) and magnetic ( @xmath11 ) fields inside a ferromagnetic material can be described as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "note that in general , due to the inevitable losses of microwaves propagating inside the ferromagnetic material , there is a phase difference @xmath14 between the dynamic @xmath10 and @xmath11 fields .",
    "such a relative phase is determined by the frequency - dependent wave impedance of the materials@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the rf @xmath10 field drives a rf current @xmath15 , while the rf @xmath11 field exerts a field torque on the magnetization and drives it to precess around its equilibrium direction [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) ] .",
    "such a magnetization precession is described by the non - equilibrium magnetization @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the high - frequency conductivity and polder tensor , respectively .",
    "note that due to the resonance nature of the precession , @xmath19 lags @xmath11 by a spin resonance phase @xmath20 . however , despite the phase of @xmath14 and @xmath20 , the dynamic @xmath21 and @xmath19 keep the coherence of their respective driving fields , so that the product of any combination of their components may generate a time independent signal proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the time average .",
    "the amplitude of such a signal depends on the phase difference of @xmath21 and @xmath19 , which can be easily understood from the trigonometric relation : @xmath24/2 $ ] .",
    "this is the spin rectification@xcite as we highlight in table i. for transport measurements on magnetic structures under microwave irradiation , various magnetoresistance effects such as anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) , giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) and tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) make corrections to ohm s law via their corresponding magnetoresistance terms@xcite .",
    "such non - linear terms typically lead to the product of @xmath21 and @xmath19 .",
    "spin rectifications induced by such magnetoresistance effects are listed in table i by the terms labeled @xmath25 .",
    "the general feature of @xmath25 is that its amplitude depends on both the relative phase @xmath14 and the spin resonance phase @xmath20 , which leads to a characteristic phase signature of the fmr line shape@xcite .",
    "similar to the effect of the rf @xmath11 field torque , a spin torque induced by a spin polarized current may also drive magnetization precession .",
    "for example , in a bilayer [ fig . [ fig1](b ) ] made of a ferromagnetic layer and a nonmagnetic layer with spin - orbit coupling@xcite , in addition to the rf current @xmath21 flowing in the ferromagnetic layer , the rf @xmath10 field also induces a rf charge current flowing in the nonmagnetic layer . via the spin hall effect in such a nonmagnetic layer with spin - orbit coupling",
    ", the rf charge current can be converted into a spin current @xmath26 , which may flow into the ferromagnetic layer and then drive the magnetization precession via the spin torque .",

    "induced spin rectification , a photovoltage depending on the spin hall effect may be generated in the ferromagnetic layer .",

    "it tunnels into the free layer and drives the magnetization precession via the spin torque [ fig . [ fig1](f ) ] .",
    "the induced spin rectification signal has been measured in spin diodes@xcite , which is listed in table i by the term labeled @xmath31 .    over the past few years",
    ", systematic studies on spin rectifications induced by the field ( @xmath25 ) and spin torque ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) have been performed , respectively , at the university of manitoba@xcite and cornell university@xcite .",
    "it has been found that due to the coherent nature of spin rectification , @xmath25 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 all depend on the phase difference between @xmath21 and @xmath19 .",
    "however , only the field torque spin rectification ( @xmath25 ) can be controlled by the relative phase @xmath14 of the microwaves.@xcite    in addition to such coherent spin rectification effects , it is known that at the interface between a ferromagnetic and a nonmagnetic layer , microwave excitation may generate a spin polarized current flowing across the interface via the spin pumping effect@xcite .",
    "this effect has been observed in a few striking experiments by measuring either transmission electron spin resonance@xcite or enhanced magnetization damping@xcite .",
    "it involves fmr , exchange coupling and non - equilibrium spin diffusion . in our opinion",
    "the physical picture of spin pumping was best explained in the classical paper of silsbee @xmath32 [ ref .",
    "] , which highlighted the key mechanism of dynamic exchange coupling between the precessing magnetization and the spin polarized current .",
    "such a dynamic coupling significantly `` amplifies '' the effect of the rf @xmath11 field in generating non - equilibrium spins .",
    "it was later proposed that the spin current generated via spin pumping may also induce a photovoltage , either across the interface in a spin battery@xcite , or within the nonmagnetic layer via the inverse spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "recent experiments performed on magnetic bilayers@xcite have found that spin - pumping induced dc voltage ( the term @xmath33 in table i ) should be about two orders of magnitude smaller than spin hall induced spin rectification ( the term labeled @xmath30 ) . in contrast to phase sensitive coherent spin rectification effects , the proposed spin - pumping photovoltage is based on incoherent spin diffusion and fmr absorption .",
    "hence , the anticipated fmr line shape is symmetric and phase - independent .",

    "this issue has been partially addressed by a number of theoretical@xcite and experimental works@xcite studying nanostructured mtjs where the photovoltage is dominated by the spin torque induced spin rectification .",
    "enlightened by these works and also based on our own previous studies @xcite , we discuss in the following the critical issue of fmr line shape analysis in microstructured devices , where the field and spin torque induced spin rectification may have comparable strength .",
    "our theoretical consideration and experimental data demonstrate the pivotal role of the relative phase @xmath14 , which was often under - estimated in previous studies . via systematic studies with different device structures , measurement configurations and frequency ranges ,",
    "we find that @xmath14 has to be calibrated at different microwave frequencies for each device independently . hence",
    ", our results are in strong contradiction with the recent experiment performed on microstructured magnetic bilayers for quantifying the spin hall angles , where @xmath14 was declared to be zero for all devices at different microwave frequencies@xcite .",
    "from table i , the role of the phase in the fmr line shape symmetry can be understood by considering the spin rectified voltage @xmath49 . for spin rectification induced by the field torque , depending on the experimental configuration ,",
    "at least one matrix component @xmath50 of the polder tensor @xmath51 will drive the fmr ; whether an on or off - diagonal component is responsible for the magnetization precession depends on the measurement configuration . since @xmath52 , @xmath53 . therefore after time averaging a time independent dc voltage is found @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "it is well known that for diagonal matrix elements , @xmath55 has a dispersive line shape while @xmath56 has a symmetric line shape .",
    "however since the on and off - diagonal susceptibilities differ by a phase of @xmath57 , if the fmr is driven by an off - diagonal susceptibility , the roles are reversed and @xmath55 has a symmetric line shape while @xmath56 has a dispersive line shape .",
    "based on the simple argument leading to the above @xmath58 expression , one can see that the line shape symmetry has a characteristic dependence on the relative phase @xmath14 between electric and magnetic fields .",
    "thus when measuring fmr based on the field torque induced spin rectification effect , it is important to consider the relative phase , whereas for a spin pumping measurement which measures @xmath59 , or for a spin torque induced spin rectification which involves @xmath60 , the relative phase does not influence the experiment . in the next two sections , a detailed analysis is given by solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation , which leads to analytical formulae describing the symmetric and dispersive line shapes for different measurement configurations .",
    "the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation provides a phenomenological description of ferromagnetic dynamics based on a torque provided by the internal magnetic field @xmath61 which acts on the magnetization * m * , causing it to precess@xcite    @xmath62    here @xmath63 is the effective electron gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath64 is the gilbert damping parameter which can be used to determine the fmr line width @xmath65 , according to @xmath66 .",

    "@xmath20 will change from 180@xmath79 ( driving force out of phase ) to 0@xmath79 ( driving force in phase ) around the resonance position , in a range on the order of @xmath65 , passing through 90@xmath79 at resonance .",
    "this represents the universal feature of a resonance ; the phase of the dynamic response always lags behind the driving force.@xcite    to emphasize the resonant feature of the susceptibility tensor elements we define the symmetric lorentz line shape @xmath80 , and the dispersive line shape @xmath81 as @xmath82    clearly the spin resonance phase can also be written in terms of @xmath80 and @xmath81 as @xmath77 = \\arctan(l / d)$ ] so that @xmath83 and @xmath84",

    "this product removes the phase dependence carried by @xmath80 and @xmath81 and leaves only the lorentz line shape . for the same reason , the microwave photovoltage induced by spin pumping ( the @xmath33 term in table i )",
    "has a symmetric line shape .",
    "the susceptibility for the two cases of in - plane and perpendicularly applied dc magnetic fields can easily be found from eq .",
    "( [ as ] ) by using the appropriate demagnetization factors .",
    "when the lateral dimensions are much larger than the thickness , n@xmath6 = n@xmath91 = 0 and n@xmath92 = 1 for an in - plane field and n@xmath6 = n@xmath92 = 0 and n@xmath91 = 1 for a field applied at a small angle from the perpendicular . in this paper , we focus on the in - plane case .",
    "the line shape analysis for the perpendicular case can be found in ref . .",

    "( [ vx ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ vy ] ) demonstrate that a change in the relative electromagnetic phase is expected to result in a change in the line shape of the electrically detected fmr .",

    "this is similar to the microwave propagation in a waveguide where the field distribution @xmath168 the waveguide modes , are known to depend strongly on boundary conditions and frequency.@xcite despite the complex wave properties , the key message of our results is clear and consistent with the consideration of the physics of the relative phase : it shows that in order to properly analyze the fmr line shape , @xmath14 has to be determined for each frequency independently .",
    "[ t ]      in order to drive the fmr using the rf field in the @xmath100 direction , @xmath119 , a second generation spin dynamo was fabricated with the py strip underneath the cpw as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in this case",
    "the 300 @xmath144 m @xmath145 7 @xmath144 m @xmath145 100 nm py strip is underneath the cu / cr coplanar waveguide which is fabricated on a sio@xmath2/si substrate . again",
    "a microwave current is directly injected into the cpw and induces a current in the @xmath99 direction in the py strip .",
    "the dominant rf field in the py is still the oersted field , but due to the new geometry it is in the @xmath100 direction .    due to the smaller width and larger thickness , the demagnetization factor ,",
    "@xmath174 is twice that in the first generation sample .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath163 = 8.0 mt as indicated by the broader amr curve in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) .",
    "this value is further confirmed by the @xmath78 vs @xmath103 plot shown in fig . [ fig6](e ) .",
    "[ fig6](f ) shows the frequency dependence of @xmath78 for fmr ( circles ) and for the first perpendicular standing spin wave resonance ( swr ) ( triangles ) measured at @xmath164 .",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath78 follows @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the exchange field . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](f ) the standing swr is fit using @xmath177ghz / t , @xmath178 mt and @xmath179 t.    similar to the results presented in the previous section , the line shape of fmr measured on the second generation sample is also found to be frequency dependent ( not shown ) .",
    "hence , @xmath14 is found to be non - zero in the general case .",
    "for example , at @xmath9/2@xmath180 = 8 ghz , the line shape is found to be nearly symmetric , as shown in fig . [ fig6](d ) for the fmr measured at @xmath181 , which indicates @xmath14 is close to @xmath182 at this frequency .",
    "note that our result is in direct contrast with the recent study of ref .",
    "and , where experiments were measured in the same configuration and where it was suggested that @xmath14 = 0@xmath79 for all samples at all frequencies .",
    "[ t ]    while the line shape and hence the relative phase is found to be frequency dependent , @xmath14 is expected to be independent of the static field direction @xmath103 .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) which shows the line shape measured at several values of @xmath103 in 10@xmath79 increments .",
    "the data can be fit well using eq .",
    "( [ vx ] ) with a constant @xmath183 for all @xmath103 .",
    "it confirms that the fmr is driven by a single * h * component , in this case the @xmath119 field , and that @xmath14 does not depend on @xmath103 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) the @xmath103 dependence of @xmath169 and @xmath170 ( solid / circles and dashed / squares respectively ) is shown .",
    "the circles and squares are experimental data while the solid and dashed lines are fitting results using a @xmath184 function according to eq .",
    "( [ vx ] ) .",
    "it provides further proof that the @xmath119 field is responsible for driving the fmr in this sample .",
    "while the results from both the 1st and 2nd generation spin dynamos show consistently that @xmath14 is sample and frequency dependent , the 2nd generation spin dynamos exhibit special features in comparison with the 1st generation spin dynamos : the reduced separation between the py strip and cpw enhances the @xmath119 field so that the line width @xmath65 is enhanced by non - linear magnetization damping@xcite , which depends on the cone angle @xmath185 of the precession via the relation @xmath186 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) , @xmath65 is found to oscillate between 4.0 and 9.0 mt as @xmath103 changes . at @xmath187 , @xmath188 and",
    "the cone angle is at its largest ( about 4@xmath79 ) .",
    "as @xmath103 increases from @xmath189 and moves toward 90@xmath79 , @xmath185 decreases so that the non - linear damping contribution to @xmath65 decreases . using the cone angle calculated from fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig7](d ) @xmath190 as a function of the cone angle .",
    "it shows that @xmath191 has a quadratic dependence on the precession cone angle , which is in agreement with our previous study in the perpendicular @xmath97-field configuration@xcite .",
    "we note that for cone angles above only a few degrees , the non - linear damping already dominates the contribution to @xmath191 .",
    "again , this is in direct contrast with the result of mosendz _",
    "et al._,@xcite , where @xmath65 was found to be constant by varying @xmath103 , indicating no influence from non - linear damping , but the cone angle @xmath185 was estimated to be as high as 15@xmath79 based on the line shape analysis assuming relative phase @xmath14 = 0 .",
    "next we consider the most general case which is described by eq .",
    "( [ fullv ] ) where all components of * h * may contribute to the fmr line shape .",
    "the sample used here is a single py strip where a waveguide with a horn antennae provided both the electric and magnetic driving fields .",
    "the sample chip is mounted near the centre , at the end of a rectangular waveguide and the py strip is directed along the short axis of the waveguide .",
    "[ t ]    in a waveguide , the electromagnetic fields are well known and in general three components , @xmath192 and @xmath193 exist.@xcite figure [ fig8](a ) shows both the fmr and perpendicular standing swr at @xmath103 = 45@xmath79 .",
    "indeed both the amplitude and the line shape are different for the two fmr peaks located at @xmath135 and @xmath138 , which indicates the existence of multiple * h * field components and eq .",
    "( [ fullv ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ld ] ) are needed to separate them .",
    "this separation is done using the lorentz and dispersive amplitudes determined from a fit to the fmr which are plotted as a function of @xmath103 in fig . [",
    "fig8](b ) and ( c ) for @xmath194 and 11.2 ghz , respectively .",
    "a fit using eq .",
    "( [ ld ] ) allows a separation of the contributions from each of the @xmath192 and @xmath193 fields based on the their different contributions to the @xmath103 dependence of the line shape .",
    "[ h ]    .angular separation of * h * field components for 12 and 11.2 ghz . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of the fit have been tabulated in table [ table2 ] where @xmath195ghz / t , @xmath196 = 0.97 t and @xmath197 = 152 mt were used .",
    "the amplitudes of the different * h * field components have been normalized with respect to the @xmath119 component . at both 11.2 and 12 ghz",
    "the @xmath119 field is much larger than @xmath120 or @xmath193 , which is expected based on the wave propagation in a horn antennae .    in changing from 11.2 to 12 ghz the relative phase for each component",
    "is seen to change .",
    "therefore even in the case of a complex line shape produced by multiple * h * field components , by separating the individual contributions of the rf magnetic field via angular dependence measurements , the relative phase @xmath14 of each field component is found to be frequency dependent .",
    "[ h ! ]      in addition to the frequency and sample dependencies , the relative phase @xmath14 may also depend on the lead configuration and wiring conditions of a particular device , as we have mentioned in section a. here , we address such additional influences by using the first generation spin dynamos@xcite shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) .",
    "two spin dynamos with the same lateral dimensions but different py thickness @xmath198 are studied .",
    "each spin dynamo involves two identical py strips denoted by s1 and s2 , one in each center of the g - s strips of the cpw , which are placed symmetrically with respect to the s strip .",
    "the current and rf @xmath11 field are induced in the py via a microwave current directly injected into the cpw .",
    "similar to the sample discussed in section a , @xmath140 is the dominant field which drives the fmr .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) , fmr measured at @xmath159 = 5 ghz on the sample s1 with @xmath198 = 100 nm shows a nearly symmetric lorentz line shape and a field symmetry of @xmath137 . from the fmr line shape",
    "fitting , @xmath14 = -11@xmath79 is found .",
    "interestingly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) , the fmr of the sample s2 of the same spin dynamo measured under the same experimental conditions shows a different line shape , from which a different @xmath14 = 22@xmath79 is found .",
    "we can further compare @xmath14 measured on the other spin dynamo with a different py thickness of @xmath198 = 60 nm , also at @xmath159 = 5 ghz . here for s1 , @xmath14 = -29@xmath79 while for s2 , @xmath14 = 27@xmath79 .",
    "again , the relative phase is found different for s1 and s2 .",
    "these results demonstrate that due to additional influences such as a different lead configuration and wiring conditions , even for samples with the same lateral dimensions , @xmath14 in each device is not necessarily the same .",
    "it demonstrates clearly that the relative phase @xmath14 can not be simply determined by analyzing the fmr line shape measured on a reference device .      the experimental data presented above show that regardless of the fmr driving field configuration , the relative phase between the rf electric and magnetic field is sample and frequency dependent and non - zero .",
    "this non - zero phase results in both symmetric and antisymmetric lorentz line shapes in the fmr detected via field - torque induced spin rectification .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence of the line shape symmetry changes based on which component of the rf @xmath11 field is responsible for driving the fmr precession .",
    "for instance a purely antisymmetric line shape could correspond to @xmath199 if the fmr is driven by @xmath119 , or to @xmath200 if the fmr is driven by @xmath120 , therefore the line shape itself can not be used to determine @xmath14 directly . to separate the * h * field components an angular ( @xmath103 )",
    "dependence measurement is necessary , which allows both * h * as well as the phase to be determined .",
    "using such a measurement @xmath14 has been observed to change from 0@xmath79 to 90@xmath79 in a narrow frequency range ( 0.6 ghz ) resulting in a change from an antisymmetric to symmetric line shape demonstrating the large effect the relative phase has on the fmr line shape .",
    "furthermore @xmath14 is not identical even in samples with the same geometrical size .",
    "therefore in our opinion @xmath14 can not be simply determined from a reference sample but should be calibrated for each sample , at each frequency and for each measurement cycle .",
    "spin rectifications caused by the coupling between current and magnetization in a ferromagnetic microstrip provide a powerful tool for the study of spin dynamics . in order to distinguish different mechanisms which enable the electrical detection of fmr via microwave photovoltages , it is essential to properly analyze the fmr line shape . for spin rectification caused by a microwave field torque , due to the coherent nature of this coupling ,",
    "the resulting dc voltage depends strongly on the relative phase between the rf electric and magnetic fields used to drive the current and magnetization , respectively .",
    "therefore not only does electrical fmr detection provide a route to study the relative phase , but it also necessitates calibrating the relative phase prior to performing electrically detected fmr experiments . based on a systematic study of the electrically detected fmr , the line shape is observed to depend strongly on the microwave frequency , driving field configuration , sample structure and even wiring conditions .",
    "it is in general a combination of lorentz and dispersive contributions .",
    "these effects have been quantitatively explained by accounting for the relative phase shift between electric and magnetic fields .",
    "analytical formula have been established to analyze the fmr line shape .",
    "our results imply that for electrically detected fmr which involves both spin hall and spin rectification effects , the pivotal relative phase must be calibrated independently in order to properly analyze the fmr line shape and quantify the spin hall angle .",
    "this can not be done by using a reference sample but could be achieved through such techniques as spintronic michelson interferometry@xcite .",
