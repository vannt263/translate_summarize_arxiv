    "the importance of the cosmological light - cone effect in the future redshift surveys , including the two - degree field ( 2df ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , has been well recognized recently ( e.g. , matarrese et  al . 1997 ; matsubara , suto , & szapudi 1997 ; nakamura , matsubara , & suto 1998 ; moscardini et al .",

    "paper iii ) , we have extensively explored and discussed various aspects of the cosmological light - cone effect on the two - point correlation functions , @xmath1 , of objects at high redshifts . extending the procedure described in these papers , we develop here a formula to predict the power spectrum of cosmological objects located on the light cone , @xmath2 .",
    "inhomogeneities of the matter distribution might affect the light propagation , i.e. , the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "in fact , the angular correlation functions are significantly affected by the gravitational lensing through the magnification bias . the spatial correlations which we study in the present paper , however , are fairly insensitive to the effect ( e.g. , moessner , jain , & villumsen 1998 )",
    ". therefore we ignore lensing effect below .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we define an estimator for the power spectrum constructed from a sample of cosmological sources on a light cone , which generalizes the conventional power spectrum defined on the constant - time hypersurface . by computing the ensemble average of the estimator",
    ", we derive the power spectrum on the light cone .",
    "a mathematical derivation is outlined in appendix a. while this rigorous procedure assumes linear theory of density perturbations in real space , the effects of nonlinear gravitational growth and redshift - space distortion are important in practice ( papers ii and iii ) .",
    "thus we incorporate those effects as described in  3 .",
    "then we apply our theoretical results to galaxy and quasar samples with the sdss spectroscopic samples specifically in mind (  4 ) .",
    "finally  5 is devoted to discussion and conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we use the units in which the light velocity @xmath3 is unity .",
    "in this section we describe our theoretical formulation for the power spectrum on a light - cone hypersurface which proceeds fairly parallel to paper i. for simplicity , we focus on the spatially - flat friedmann - lematre universe , whose line element is expressed in terms of the conformal time @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",

    "all cosmological objects observed from redshift surveys are located on the light - cone hypersurface of the space - time ( [ metric ] ) , defined by an observer .",
    "we locate the fiducial observer at the origin of the coordinates ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , and therefore an object at @xmath9 and @xmath4 on the light - cone hypersurface of the observer satisfies a simple relation @xmath10 .",
    "then the ( real - space ) position of the source on the light - cone hypersurface is specified by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a unit vector along the line - of - sight . in order to avoid confusion ,",
    "we introduce a radial coordinate @xmath13 instead of @xmath9 , and write the metric of the three - dimensional real space as @xmath14 let us denote the number density field of the sources on the light cone by @xmath15 , which is simply related to the comoving number density of objects at a conformal time @xmath4 and at a position @xmath11 as @xmath16 introducing the mean _ observed _ ( comoving ) number density @xmath17 at time @xmath4 and the density fluctuation of luminous objects @xmath18 , we write @xmath19 .",

    "note that @xmath17 is different from the mean number density of the objects @xmath22 at @xmath4 by the selection function which depends on the luminosity function of the objects and thus on the magnitude - limit of a survey ( see paper i and  4 below )",
    ".    following the conventional treatment of the power spectrum in cosmology ( e.g. , feldman , kaiser , & peacock 1994 ) , we introduce the number density field of cosmological objects on the light cone : @xmath23^{1 \\over 2 } } , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the number density of the synthetic catalog without structure , which has the mean number density @xmath25 . to be specific , it satisfies @xmath26 where we neglect the poisson noise term .",
    "a power spectrum on the light cone , which can be estimated from a given survey , is written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the volume of a thin shell with the radius @xmath29 in the fourier space , and @xmath30 is the fourier transform of equation ( [ 1 ] ) : @xmath31 e^{i\\bf k\\cdot r }    \\over \\displaystyle \\left[\\int d^3{\\bf r } \\n0lc(r)^2\\right]^{1 \\over 2}}~.\\ ] ]    finally the power spectrum on the light cone , @xmath32 , can be computed by taking the ensemble average of the above estimator ( [ eq : pkobs ] ) : @xmath33    [ n^{\\rm lc}(r_2,\\bft_2)-n_s^{\\rm lc}(r_2,\\bft_2)]\\bigr >    e^{i { \\bf k } \\cdot ( { \\bf r}_1-{\\bf r}_2 ) }    \\over \\displaystyle\\int d^3{\\bf r } n_0^{\\rm lc}(r)^2 } .",

    "also subscripts @xmath34 and @xmath35 indicate those in real and redshift spaces , and subscripts lin and nl refer to those in linear and nonlinear models .    assuming linear bias between density fluctuations of mass and luminous objects and also linear theory for growth of density fluctuations",
    ", we find that equation ( [ eq : defpklc ] ) reduces to the following expression : @xmath36^{-1 }    \\int dr_1r_1 \\int dr_2 r_2 \\n0lc(r_1)\\n0lc(r_2 )    d_1(\\eta_0-r_1)d_1(\\eta_0-r_2 ) \\nonumber\\\\    & ~ & \\hspace{0.1cm}\\times{1\\over 2\\pi k}\\int^\\infty_0dk_1k_1   p_{\\rm   r , lin}(k_1,\\eta_0 )    b(k_1;\\eta_0-r_1)b(k_1;\\eta_0-r_2 ) \\pi(r_1,r_2,k_1,k)~ , \\label{plc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the linear growth rate normalized unity at present , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the linear bias factor , and @xmath40 with the cosine integral function @xmath41 defined as @xmath42 the derivation of equation ( [ plc ] ) from equation ( [ eq : defpklc ] ) is quite tedious but straightforward which we outline in appendix a.      while equation ( [ plc ] ) for power spectrum on the light cone is exact as long as linear theory of density fluctuations and a linear bias model are adopted , it looks fairly complicated",
    ". therefore it is instructive to consider a practical approximation to equation ( [ plc ] ) .",
    "one can show that the function @xmath43 ( eq.[[defpi ] ] ) is peaked around @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , if one replaces the function as @xmath46 equation ( [ plc ] ) reduces to @xmath47 with @xmath48^{-1 }      { \\int dr r^2 n_0^{\\rm lc}(r){}^2                d_1(\\eta_0-r)^2 } b(k;\\eta_0-r)^2~. \\label{alphad}\\ ] ] in an extreme case of no evolution without biasing , i.e. , @xmath49 , @xmath50 becomes unity , and @xmath0 is equivalent to @xmath51 as expected .",
    "thus if the approximation ( [ deltaasym ] ) is justified , @xmath50 quantifies the degree of the light - cone effect on a specified survey , which sensitively depends on the observed selection function and the assumed time - evolution of linear bias .",
    "figure [ fig : pklcapprox ] compares the power spectra on a light cone , equations ( [ plc ] ) and ( [ plcb ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath0 in the exact formula becomes significantly larger than @xmath52 for @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the depth of the survey volume .",
    "this artifact is not particular to the light - cone effect , but simply originates from the fact that the power on scales comparable to , or larger than , the finite size of the survey volume can not be properly evaluated .",
    "thus except for the range @xmath55 , where the estimate of the power is fairly reliable for a given observational sample , figure [ fig : pklcapprox ] shows that the approximation ( [ plcb ] ) reproduces the exact formula very accurately .",
    "therefore in what follows , we will incorporate several important effects ( redshift - space distortion , nonlinear density and velocity evolution , and the observational selection function ) on the basis of the approximation .    while the results in figure [ fig : pklcapprox ] do not include the selection function , i.e. , @xmath56=constant .",
    "is assumed , we also examined the case with the proper selection functions for galaxies and quasars (  4 ) , and made sure that our approximation agrees with the exact formula within several percents at worst .",
    "this level of accuracy is sufficiently good in the light of the other approximations employed in describing the nonlinearity of density and velocity fields , most notably , the uncertainty of the model of bias .",
    "the results presented in the previous section are unrealistically simplified since we have neglected several important effects including the redshift - space distortion due to the peculiar velocity effect ( kaiser 1987 ) , nonlinear evolution of mass density fluctuations and of peculiar velocity dispersions ( finger - of - god ) , evolution of the bias parameter ( e.g. , fry 1996 ) , and the observational selection function which depends on a specific survey strategy . in this section",
    "we describe our modeling to the first three effects which are the necessary ingredients in completing the theoretical predictions .",
    "the selection function is discussed in the next section .",
    "strictly speaking , inclusion of these effects invalidates the exact derivation of the formula ( [ plc ] ) unfortunately .",
    "therefore we implement a _",
    "phenomenological _ correction to these effects as described below , but we believe that this procedure is important and useful in practice , especially given the uncertainty of the bias evolution itself .",
    "the cosmological observation is possible only in redshift space .",
    "the redshift - space distortion in linear theory , first discussed by kaiser ( 1987 ) , is easily included in our formula for power spectrum on the light cone in real space . in linear theory , the direction  averaged power spectrum in redshift space , @xmath57 is related to that in real space , @xmath58 , as @xmath59   p_{\\rm r , lin}(k , z ) .",

    "then @xmath61 is defined by @xmath62 see matsubara & suto ( 1996 ) , hamilton ( 1998 ) and paper iii for extensive discussion on the redshift - space distortion .",
    "substituting equation ( [ defps ] ) in equation ( [ plc ] ) yields the expression for @xmath63 which is approximated as @xmath64   \\over { \\displaystyle \\int dr r^2 \\n0lc(r)^2 } } .",
    "\\hspace*{0.5 cm } \\label{eq : aslin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a similar expression for the linear redshift - space distortion on two - point correlation functions is derived in paper ii .",
    "nonlinear evolution of mass density field introduces the additional @xmath29-dependence on the light - cone power spectrum . while the full description of the nonlinear gravitational evolution of density fields is almost impossible , fairly accurate fitting formulae for @xmath65",
    "have been obtained ( e.g. , peacock & dodds 1994,1996 ) .",
    "we attempt to correct for the nonlinear density evolution simply by adopting the fitting formulae , and then obtain an approximate expression for @xmath66 as follows : @xmath67      finally an effect of the nonlinear velocity field , _ finger - of - god _",

    "for quasars , we compute a selection function for b - band magnitude limited samples following paper i on the basis of the luminosity function by wallington & narayan ( 1993 ; see also nakamura & suto 1997 ) .      for definiteness , we consider scdm ( standard cold dark matter ) and lcdm ( lambda cold dark matter ) models , which have @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "these sets of cosmological parameters are chosen so as to reproduce the observed cluster abundance ( kitayama & suto 1997 ) .",

    "we adopt the b - band limiting magnitude @xmath87 and @xmath88 for galaxies and quasars , respectively , so as to roughly match the sdss and 2df spectroscopic samples . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "the results are divided by the corresponding linear power spectrum on the constant - time hypersurface in real space at @xmath89 , @xmath90 . for simplicity",
    "we adopt a scale - independent linear bias model of fry ( 1996 ) ; @xmath91 and @xmath92 for galaxies and quasars ( @xmath93 in eq.[[frym ] ] below ) .",
    "purely linear theory predictions , @xmath63 , are plotted in dotted lines , which use the cdm transfer function by bardeen et al.(1986 ; bbks ) and the linear redshift - space distortion ( [ eq : plcslin ] ) by kaiser ( 1987 ) .",
    "we show two different versions of @xmath94 ; both adopt the peacock & dodds ( 1996 ; pd ) nonlinear spectrum , one , plotted in dashed lines , uses linear redshift - space distortion , and the other ( solid lines ) uses the nonlinear model ( [ eq : plcsnl ] ) with the velocity dispersion formula by mo , jing & brner ( 1997 ) .    in linear regime",
    ", the light - cone effect suppresses the amplitude of spectrum in real space due to the smaller fluctuation at larger @xmath77 unless the possible evolution of bias exceeds the linear growth rate of the mass fluctuations .",
    "the redshift - space distortion , on the other hand , tends to increase the observable power spectrum in redshift space .",
    "thus the overall effect of the linear redshift - space distortion on the light cone is to increase ( decrease ) the amplitude of @xmath95 for galaxy ( quasar ) samples in a @xmath29-independent manner .",
    "the situation becomes complicated in nonlinear regimes , which produces the additional @xmath29-dependent behavior .",
    "while the nonlinear evolution of density field enhances the amplitude of both @xmath66 and @xmath94 relative to their counterparts in linear theory , the suppression due to the finger - of - god is much stronger . consequently @xmath94 is smaller than @xmath96 for any @xmath29 , and in fact",
    "the suppression is stronger for larger @xmath29 . since recent numerical simulations ( mo , jing , & brner 1997 ; jing 1998 ; suto et al .",
    "1999 ; magira et al .",
    "1999 ) confirmed that the nonlinear fitting formulae of density and velocity fields are accurate and reliable within several percents , these conclusions are generic as long as the bias is time - independent .",
    "the bias , however , is predicted to show strong time evolution .",
    "furthermore the realistic bias is expected to be neither time - independent nor linear ( fry 1996 ; mo & white 1996 ) ; it may even not be deterministic ( tegmark & peebles 1998 ; dekel & lahav 1999 ; taruya , koyama & soda 1999 ) .",
    "we will discuss this problem in detail elsewhere , and focus on the effect of time - evolution of bias in the next subsection .      as discussed in previous subsection ,",
    "the most uncertain aspect of the theoretical predictions of @xmath2 is the model of bias .",
    "since it is unlikely that any reliable theoretical model for bias is established in near future , all that one can try is to explore the possible effects by adopting a simple parametric model . while several phenomenological models of evolution of bias have been proposed in the literature ( e.g. , moscardini , et  al .",
    "1998 ; matarrese , et  al .",
    "1997 ) , we adopt the following simple model : @xmath97^p } [ b_0 - 1 ] , \\label{frym}\\ ] ] with @xmath98 is the bias parameter at present .",
    "when the constant index @xmath99 is unity , the model reproduces the time - evolution of the lowest - order bias coefficient which is discussed by fry ( 1996 ) on the basis of the continuity equation of mass and galaxy density fields .",
    "figure [ fig : alphabias ] plots @xmath100 and @xmath101 for @xmath93 ( fry s model ) and @xmath102 ( regarded as an extreme example for comparison ) as a function of @xmath103 .",
    "the selection functions for the galaxy and quasar samples are identical to those adopted in figure [ fig : pklcgq ] . for shallow samples like",
    "the sdss galaxies , theoretical predictions are fairly insensitive to the applied model of evolution of bias ; the cosmological light - cone effect on these samples is dominated by the redshift - space distortion . for deeper samples , however , the amplitude is very sensitive to the evolution of bias ; especially when the bias evolves faster than the linear growth rate ( @xmath104 ) , the redshift - space distortion becomes relatively negligible on linear scales .",
    "in this paper we have developed a theoretical formulation to compute the power spectrum of cosmological objects on the light - cone hypersurface . on the basis of the exact formula which works in linear theory and in real space ,",
    "we have obtained a useful approximate expression valid on scales less than the survey volume size ( further discussions for the validity of the approximation will be given elsewhere ; nishioka & yamamoto 1999b ) . in linear theory , the light - cone effect simply suppresses ( in general ) the amplitude of the observable power spectrum ( as in the case of the two - point correlation functions ; see papers i , ii and iii ) .",
    "then we improved the approximate formula by including the nonlinear evolution of density fields , and linear and nonlinear redshift - space distortion phenomenologically but in a manner fully consistent with the recent numerical simulations .",
    "these nonlinearities produce the additional scale - dependence in the power spectrum on the light cone compared with those defined on the constant - time hypersurface .    applying this expression to the galaxy and quasar samples selected so",
    "as to match the upcoming sdss spectroscopic samples , for instance , we have quantitatively evaluated the degree of the light - cone effect . with these example",
    ", we have demonstrated that we have developed a fairly reliable and useful method to compute the power spectrum on the light cone _ given an evolution model of bias_. in fact , it is clear that the evolution of bias sensitively changes the behavior of the power spectrum on the light cone , especially for quasar samples .",
    "while our present analysis assumes the simplest bias model , linear bias , we plan to extend our formulation for the general bias model including the stochastic bias models ( dekel & lahav 1999 ; taruya , koyama , & soda 1999 )    we thank y.kojima , t.matsubara and m.sasaki for useful discussions and comments , and y.p.jing and h.magira for providing numerical routines to compute fitting formulae for nonlinear density and velocity fields .",
