    "one of the differences between field theories and mechanical systems is that field theories have an infinite number of degrees of freedom , which makes possible spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "more generally , we know , by now , that also dynamical symmetry breaking plays an important role in modern physics . in condensed matter physics , for example",
    ", such a mechanism is used to describe superconductivity , by the condensate of cooper pairs , while for particle physics it is the main source of hadron masses and governs the low energy hadron dynamics .",
    "connected with dynamical symmetry breaking comes the problem of restoration of broken symmetries for some sufficiently high temperature .",
    "as it is well known , a phase transition occurs when there is a singularity in the free energy or one of its derivatives .",
    "the fact that almost all phenomena studied in theories near the transition point exhibit scaling , that is , a power - law behavior between two mesurable quantities , leads naturally to the classification of different conformal field theories in universality classes , which are itself determined by a set of numbers usually called critical indices .",
    "a large number of conformal field theories is known in two dimensions and none is firmly established in four .",
    "the dimensionality @xmath2 is between these extremes and contains two well established families of conformal field theories .",
    "the first family contains the usual ising , xy and heisenberg critical @xmath3 models and is characterized by a particular set of exponents called scalar critical exponents .",
    "the second family contains various critical four fermion models @xcite and the set of exponents that characterizes it is called chiral critical exponents . the critical properties of the great majority of phase transitions in three euclidean dimensions ( magnetic systems , superconductors etc . ) are quite accurately described by the first family of conformal field theories while the finite - temperature phase transitions in certain @xmath4 dimensional quantum field theories are argued to belong to these same universality classes @xcite .",
    "when studying the finite - temperature chiral restoration in qcd one is usually gided by the concepts of dimensional reduction and universality . from the dimensional reduction point of view , a hot field theory can be regarded as a static field theory at zero temperature in a lower dimension @xcite .",
    "for example , four dimensional qcd with @xmath5 light quarks near the transition can be described by the three dimensional linear @xmath3 model with the same global symmetry @xcite . on the other hand , as the classification in universality classes is done by the computation of critical indices and those critical indices are infrared ( ir ) sensitive , we must understand the role of each degree of freedom in this context .",
    "this can be easily done with the use of effective field theory methods in which the integration over different energy scales gives a theory for the degrees of freedom which are the real responsible for infrared divergencies @xcite .",
    "dimensional reduction is based in the zero temperature appelquist - carazone decoupling theorem @xcite , where a low energy theory is constructed by the integration over heavy fields in the functional integral .    according to standard dimensional reduction arguments , the fermions themselves ,",
    "even if they are massless at zero temperature , do not influence the nature of phase transition at finite - temperature .",
    "it is rather their bosonic composites , the goldstone bosons , which are of importance .",
    "this follows directly from the universality of second order phase transitions @xcite , in which the commonly held assumption is that all the possible universality classes ( or equivalently , conformal field theories ) are variations of the @xmath3 model and one need only match the correct symmetry - breaking pattern . as a consequence ,",
    "the chiral transition of four dimensional qcd , with @xmath6 flavors , should lie in the same universality class as a three dimensional @xmath7 magnet .",
    "similarly , other models , e.g. four - fermion theories in @xmath8 dimensions such as the gross - neveu model ( gn model ) @xcite with discrete symmetries or the nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl model ) @xcite with continous chiral symmetry , are expected to be in the same universality class of a @xmath9 dimensional ising or heisenberg magnet , respectively .",
    "recently , however , it was pointed out that there exist different @xmath2 conformal field theories with the same symmetry - breaking pattern @xcite .",
    "they are exactly the four - fermion interaction models of the nambu - jona - lasinio type .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the fact that on the chirally symmetric side of the phase transition there are @xmath10 massless fermions whose effect is felt even in the ir fixed point , just like the goldstone bosons .",
    "the presence of more than one universality class in @xmath2 makes the procedure of dimensionally reducing a quantum field theory ambigous and it is now uncertain to which conformal field theory the @xmath11 finite - temperature quantum field theory will reduce . the argument if favor of the bosonic universality class goes as follows . at finite - temperature",
    ", the @xmath12 fermion reduces to a collection of @xmath2 massive fermions and there is no zero mode for which the matsubara frequency vanishes .",
    "nevertheless , even if a single massive field does not influence the phase transition , the cumulative effects of an infinite number of such fields may have an appreciable impact . in order to see whether or not this happens",
    ", all harmonics should be summed and their cumulative effects studied .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to discuss the assumptions underlying this analysis and to determine to which universality class the simplest generalization of the gross - neveu model with continous chiral symmetry , belongs .",
    "besides being an interesting theoretical model , it is also believed that , when properly extended to incorporate continous chiral symmetry , four - fermion models are more realistic as effective theories of qcd than the linear @xmath3 model , especially at scales where quark structure is important .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model . in section iii",
    "we compute the critical exponents at zero temperature while , in section iv , we obtain , after dimensional reduction , the new critical exponents that determines the universality class of the reduced theory . in section",
    "v , we analyse the vacuum structure at finite - temperature .",
    "conclusions are given in section vii . in the appendix",
    ", we compute the thermal renormalization group functions that controlls thedependence of the thermal counterterms on the temperature . in this paper",
    "we use @xmath13 .",
    "we are interested in studying the behavior of a multiplet of n fermions coupled with a pair of composite self - interacting pseudo - scalar and scalar fields , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , in such a way that the euclidean functional action reads @xmath16 this model has continous chiral symmetry @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 with @xmath20 being a constant and we use for the @xmath21 the following representation @xmath22 .    in order to have an",
    "uniquely defined vacuum ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , we must choose a prefered direction in the space of components , say @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and shift our fields as @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "in this new picture the euclidean action becomes @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "if we use the definition of @xmath30 we can see that @xmath31 , as it should be since the @xmath32 field is a goldstone boson .",
    "although new interaction terms have arised , it is easy to prove that this renormalizable model needs only usual wave function , mass and coupling constant renormalization to render the theory finite .",
    "= 3.5 in    the finite - temperature version of this model is obtained , in the matsubara formalism , by the compactification of the imaginary time dimension together with the imposition of ( anti)-periodic boundary conditions to ( fermionic)-bosonic fields @xcite as @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 .    since global aspects of the euclidean manifold",
    "do not affect local properties of a quantum field theory we will , again , need only those previously mentioned renormalization constants to render the theory finite .",
    "the chiral - continous gross - neveu model , in contrast to the discrete gross - neveu model , is renormalizable in four dimensions and it can be described , beyound the tree level , by all the techniques developed for the @xmath37 theory : renormalization group equations and large n expansion , for example .    to investigate the vacuum structure of the theory , we must consider the leading order density @xmath38 evaluated for constant fields @xmath23 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this gives the gap equation ( a cut - off @xmath40 is implied ) @xmath41 we define the critical coupling @xmath42 as @xmath43 so that the gap equation takes the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the reduced coupling .",
    "this form for the gap equation is particularly well suited for extracting critical indices since the problem reduces to counting the infrared divergences on the right hand side @xcite .",
    "as previously said , the critical indices are the responsible for the power - law behavior between two mesurable quantities as we approach the critical coupling . in this sense",
    "we will compute the critical exponents defined by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 etc , and show that the introduction of a self - interaction for the bosonic fields does not change the values of the exponents obtained for the njl model .",
    "first , we can see that the critical indices for the njl model are recovered by simply putting @xmath49 in the gap equation ( [ gap - equation ] ) .",
    "indeed , in this case the infrared behavior of the integral with @xmath30 goes as @xmath50 and the critical indices are simply @xmath51 and @xmath52 , since , to the order we are concerned , the self - energy and the two point function coincide .",
    "now , let us show that even with @xmath53 we still have the same critical indices . for @xmath54",
    "this is rather obvious since the singularity of the integral in ( [ gap - equation ] ) allow us to neglect the @xmath55 term in the left hand side .",
    "however , if we are in four dimensions , we can use the integral behavior ( [ integral - behavior ] ) to obtain @xmath56 and compute the @xmath57 exponent from the behavior of @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "this gives the mean field value @xmath60 , a characteristic of conformal field theories in dimensions greater or equal to 4 .",
    "we conclude that the introduction of self - interaction for the composite bosons , has not changed the structure of the ir singularities .",
    "also , we can see that , in @xmath12 all critical exponents are mean field and there are no non - gaussian fixed points while , in three dimensions the value @xmath61 tell us this is a chiral conformal field theory of the nambu - jona - lasinio type .",
    "we will now consider the problem of computing critical indices when a non zero temperature is introduced .",
    "we could do this in a similar way to what we have done in the zero temperature case but we will , instead , compute the fermionic determinant using a modified minimal subtraction scheme at zero momentum and temperature @xmath62 because this is a more suitable way of obtaining the functional form of the dimensionally reduced theory .    as we have pointed out in the introduction ,",
    "the reduced theory is an effective theory for the zero modes of the original fields @xcite ( and see also @xcite ) .",
    "it can be explicitly obtained from the initial partition funcion by integrating out the @xmath63 matsubara frequencies of the bosonic fields and , as we do not have a zero mode in the case of fermions , the complete integration over the @xmath64 and @xmath65 fields .",
    "the resulting qft will be described by an euclidean partition function of the type @xmath66 where @xmath67 includes all other local terms not present in the original lagrangian density but which are consistent with the symmetries and , in the lagrangian density @xmath68 , the parameters will be , in general , functions of the cut - off , the temperature and the bare parameters .    since we are interested in the computation of the finite - temperature effective action at the leading order in the @xmath1 expansion it is convenient to define @xmath69 and @xmath70 being the eigenvalues of @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the unit matrix .    at finite - temperature ,",
    "the integration over the imaginary time becomes a sum over matsubara frequencies and if we remember that the fields @xmath65 and @xmath64 are anti - periodic in the time component , we obtain , after integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom , the expression for the fermionic determinant @xmath73 where , as usual , @xmath34 for fermions , or yet @xmath74 the first logarithim in the above expression is naturally absorved as an overall normalization factor .",
    "the other two can be written , after integration over @xmath75 and summation over @xmath76 , as a series @xmath77 \\frac{(2\\pi)^{d-1 - 2s}}{(4\\pi)^{\\frac{d-1}{2 } } } \\frac{\\gamma\\left ( s-\\frac{d-1}{2}\\right)}{\\gamma(s ) } \\frac{\\zeta \\left ( 2s-(d-1),\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\beta^{d-2s } } , \\label{tr - ln-3}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the analytic extension of the modified epstein - hurwitz zeta function @xcite .    in the limit of high temperature ( @xmath79 ) the only contributions to the effective action comming from expression ( [ tr - ln-3 ] ) are those given by @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "those contributions are divergent so that thermal couterterms will be needed to make the reduced theory finite in this limit @xcite . in this context , we join the above divergences with those comming from the integration over non - static bosonic modes @xcite and introduce the following counterterms ( for @xmath82 ) @xmath83 and @xmath84 \\left ( -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}+ln{\\frac{2\\beta\\mu}{\\sqrt{\\pi } } } \\right ) , \\label{coupling - counterterm}\\ ] ] where , as usual , @xmath85 is the euler number , @xmath86 is a mass parameter introduced by dimensional regularization to give green functions their proper dimensions and we have defined , for simplicity @xmath87 since as @xmath79 we are in the disordered phase ( @xmath88 ) , we define @xmath89 and @xmath90 so that the renormalized action for the @xmath12 becomes @xmath91 where , as usual , @xmath92 now we are ready to start the computation of the critical indices for the reduced theory . in this sense we will , again , set @xmath93 and expand our field @xmath3 around a constant configuration @xmath30 to obtain the thermal effective potential @xmath94 the first critical exponent one usualy computes is the @xmath57 exponent which gives the power - law behavior of the order parameter with the temperature .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath95 is itself determined by the requirement of a vanishing thermal mass when @xmath96 . in this sense",
    "the condition @xmath97 gives @xmath98 in order to have a critical temperature we will , for the moment , consider the case @xmath99 .",
    "now , we can rewrite @xmath100 as @xmath101 as @xmath96 we see that , by defining the reduced temperature @xmath102 as @xmath103 we obtain @xmath104 that is , @xmath100 is linear in @xmath102 , or equivalently , we have for the first critical exponent the value @xmath60 .    the second critical exponent , the @xmath105 critial exponent , is obtained from the inhomogenious gap equation , when we consider an external source @xmath106 for the @xmath3 field . in this case , the gap equation becomes @xmath107 and , as we approach criticality @xmath108 , the gap equation gives @xmath109 , since @xmath110 dominates the @xmath111 term",
    ". finally , as we are in the leading order in the @xmath1 expansion , once again the two point function and the self - energy are the same .",
    "this tells that the @xmath112 critical exponent is also equal to @xmath57 assuming the value @xmath113 .",
    "after all , to which universality class does the reduced theory belong ?",
    "as we have seen , all critical exponents are mean field in the leading order of the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "actually , one would get the same critical exponents in this approximation in @xmath114 @xcite , although they would obviously not satisfy hyperscaling relations in this dimension .",
    "notice also that they are almost as far from the scalar critical exponents @xmath115 in three dimensions @xcite , as from the chiral critical exponents computed in the previous section @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we would be tempted to conclude that dimensional reduction really spoiled the critical behavior of thermodinamic quantities @xcite , reforcing the thesis that this procedure is ambigous . however , this sentence must be used with care .",
    "the critical exponents we have just computed are related to an effective field theory obtained from the integration over all fermions and all nonstatic bosons .",
    "since the critical indices come from the ir behavior of mesurable quantities near the transition point and the integration we have done gives ir finite results , it is reasonable to expect that the above degrees of freedom will not improve mean field values for the exponents . in order to recover non trivial values for the critical indices we must consider the effects of the zero modes @xmath116 and @xmath117 in the computation of thermodynamic quantities , because they are the only responsible for ir divergences in the finite - temperature version of this model .",
    "following the same steps of kogut in @xcite we will consider the critical behavior of the susceptibility @xmath118 for a @xmath3 model with action given by eq .",
    "( [ reduced - action ] ) . defining",
    "the critical curvature @xmath119 as the point where the susceptibility diverges @xmath120 the expression for the inverse susceptibility can be recast into @xmath121 again , the extraction of the critical index @xmath85 reduces to counting the powers of the infrared singularities in the left hand side of the previous equation . in three dimensions",
    "@xmath122 the second term in eq .",
    "( [ susceptibility ] ) dominates the scaling region , giving the zero temperature susceptibility exponent @xmath123 .",
    "it is easy to obtain the other critical exponents and they show the same type of behavior as @xmath85 .",
    "the reduced theory has scalar critical indices and due to the dimensionality of the order parameter we conclude that it belongs to the universality class of the heisenberg magnet , as reasonably expected .",
    "in the previous section , we defined the vacuum state in the @xmath116 direction , breaking spontaneously a symmetry , and computed the critical indices from the effective potential ( [ effective - potential ] ) , obtained after dimensional reduction .",
    "now comes the question .",
    "is this really a choice ? as it will become clear soon , this is definitely not a choice .    if we still had the shape of a `` mexican hat '' for the effective potential ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , we would simply have to choose a prefered direction to be the minimum configuration defining the vacuum of the theory . however ,",
    "differently from the zero temperature situation , this is no longer the case . as we can see from expression ( [ mass - counterterm ] ) , the integration over fermi fields give different thermal contributions for the masses of @xmath116 and @xmath117 and if we define the critical temperature as the temperature in which we have a vanishing mass , we will conclude that , since we have two different masses , we will have two critical temperatures @xmath124 and @xmath125 such that    @xmath126    and @xmath127 now , let us show that associated to each critical temperature there is a second order phase transition and a symmetry restoring phase . indeed , if we go from zero temperature @xmath128 to a temperature close to @xmath125 the effective potential takes the form of ( fig .",
    "2 ) . there is a discrete degeneracy of the vacuum showing that in the previous section we made a correct choice of the ground - state .    if we continue increasing the temperature in such a way that @xmath129 we note ( see fig .",
    "3 ) that the discrete symmetry in the @xmath117 direction is restored but we continue with a broken phase in the @xmath116 direction .",
    "complete restoration of symmetry ( fig .",
    "4 ) will only be achieved when @xmath130 , and this is exactly the picture after dimensional reduction since we have already taken the limit @xmath79 .",
    "all the above discussion is valid only if @xmath99 .",
    "what happens when @xmath131 ?",
    "in this case we will have only the @xmath132 critical temperature .",
    "this is to say , the discrete symmetry on the @xmath117 direction will be restored while , in the @xmath116 direction , the minimum will become deeper and deeper as we increase the temperature .",
    "we will not have a complete restoration of symmetry and the effective potential will have the shape of ( fig .",
    "dimensional reduction of the chiral - continous gross - neveu model was performed giving an effective theory that belongs to the same universality class of the heisenberg magnet . in spite of the integration over fermions and nonstatic bosons modes",
    "have given mean field results for the critical indices , we were able to explicitely determine the universality class of the reduced theory by simply taking into account the effects of the only relevant degrees of freedom in the computation of thermodynamic quantities ; the static matsubara modes .",
    "the presence of a coupling @xmath133 in the original action is the responsible for the difference on the thermal contributions for the masses of the pseudo - scalar and scalar fields @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this difference has important implications .",
    "first , we saw that if @xmath99 we have restoration of symmetry for some critical temperature , first in the @xmath117 direction and after in the @xmath116 direction , while , if @xmath131 we have only partial restoration of symmetry .",
    "the introduction of temperature in a theory with a continous chiral symmetry has changed the role played by the @xmath117 field from the zero temperature case , where it was a goldstone boson , to the finite - temperature case , where this is no longer true .",
    "we are greatfull to c. de callan , s. a. dias and r. o. ramos for interesting discussions .",
    "this paper was suported by conselho",
    "nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico do brasil ( cnpq ) and fundao coordenadoria de aperfeioamento de pessoal de nvel superior ( capes ) .",
    "we compute , for completeness , the thermal renormalization group functions which controlls the dependence of the counterterms on the temperature .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , the transition from a four - dimensional theory to an effective three - dimensional one is renormalization point dependent .",
    "this is not surprising since the appelquist - carazone decoupling theorem @xcite only holds if a particular class of renormalization prescriptions is adopted , being optimal in bphz subtractions at zero momenta and temperature @xmath57 .",
    "neverthless , we can write down the thermal renormalization group equation which controls the dependence with the temperature on the correlation functions and compute the running quantities .",
    "the independence of bare correlation functions on the choice of the renormalization point , is expressed by the conditions @xmath134 and , for simplicity , we will work , in this section , with the temperature @xmath135 instead of @xmath136 .    since we are only interested on the computation of thermal renormalization group functions , we will consider solely @xmath137 where @xmath138 @xmath139 and @xmath140 using for the effective potential the expression ( [ effective - potential ] ) we easily get @xmath141 and @xmath142 equation ( [ rg - equation ] ) can be solved by the method of characteristics .",
    "one simply introduces a dilatation parameter @xmath59 and look for functions @xmath143 ( for fixed @xmath144 ) which satisfies @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "if we now solve the above equation we get @xmath147 to investigate the large @xmath135 limit we will have to study the behavior of the effective coupling @xmath143 as @xmath59 goes to zero . since @xmath148 is positive @xmath143 will decrease .",
    "moreover , since the slope of the @xmath57 function is also positive , the gaussian ir fixed point is attractive .",
    "we can solve a similar equation to @xmath144 and defining @xmath149 as the zero of the @xmath57 function @xmath150 we see that , although the anomalous dimension for the @xmath116 field may change when we pass from the situation of total to the situation of partial restoration of symmetry , the @xmath151 exponent defined as @xmath152 remains unchanged @xmath153 .",
    "one may ask whether renormalization group improves the critical indices after dimensional reduction or not .",
    "the answer is no and this should not be surprising since the form of the ultraviolet and thermal divergences that we had to renormalize are of the same type as for a theory in four dimensions , where everything is mean field .",
