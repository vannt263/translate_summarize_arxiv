    "in the sequel , by saying that a properly embedded surface is isotopic to a surface contained in the boundary we will mean that such an isotopy is proper when restricted to time interval @xmath39    we consider two special classes of incompressible surfaces in @xmath37 namely , meridians in @xmath1 and properly embedded surfaces in @xmath1 which are homeomorphic to an annulus with the two boundary components being isotopic on @xmath44 these two classes of surfaces define two subcomplexes of @xmath40 in a similar way : the vertices are isotopy classes of meridians ( resp .",
    "annuli ) and the simplices collections of pair - wise distinct classes of meridians ( resp .",
    "annuli ) having disjoint representatives .",
    "we call the first one the ( well known ) complex of meridians @xmath45 and the second the complex of annuli @xmath46 every essential simple closed curve on @xmath25 which bounds a disk in @xmath1 gives rise to a meridian which is trivially an incompressible surface . moreover , two meridians are disjoint up to isotopy if and only if their boundaries are disjoint up to isotopy .",
    "therefore , the subcomplex of meridians @xmath47 can be viewed as a subcomplex of the complex of curves @xmath48    the complex of meridians @xmath45 has been introduced in @xcite where it was used in the study of the mapping class groups of @xmath2 manifolds .",
    "it has also been studied in @xcite where it is shown to be a quasi - convex subset of @xmath49 @xmath1 being a @xmath2manifold with boundary .    similarly , if @xmath50 is an essential simple closed curve on @xmath25 which is not homotopically trivial in @xmath37 we may consider a properly embedded annular surface @xmath51 whose boundary consists of two ( parallel ) copies of @xmath50 so that @xmath51 is isotopic to the annular region in @xmath25 bounded by its boundary components .",
    "again , two such surfaces @xmath52 are distinct up to isotopy if and only if the corresponding curves @xmath53 are distinct , up to isotopy , on @xmath54 therefore , the subcomplex of annuli @xmath55 can be viewed as a subcomplex of the complex of curves @xmath48 moreover , we have a bijection @xmath56 we will be writing @xmath57 to denote the subcomplex @xmath58 in @xmath59    our goal is to show that when @xmath1 is a handlebody of genus @xmath0 the automorphisms of the complex of incompressible surfaces are all geometric , that is , they are induced by homeomorphisms of @xmath60 however , this is not true for the whole complex @xmath59 a non - geometric automorphisms of the complex @xmath30 can be seen as follows : there exist non - separating curves @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 in @xmath25 such that the closures of the components of @xmath64 are pairs of pants @xmath65 @xmath66 which are non isotopic ( see remark [ r5 ] ) .",

    "consider the subcomplex @xmath71 of @xmath30 consisting of all vertices of infinite valence and we show that the map @xmath72 is an onto map , where @xmath73 is the group of automorphisms of the complex @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the ( extended ) mapping class group of @xmath37 i.e. the group of isotopy classes of self - homeomorphisms of @xmath60 moreover , we will show that the map @xmath76 has a @xmath77 kernel .    as explained above",
    ", the map @xmath78 is not onto .",
    "the complex @xmath30 is rich enough to distinguish between an involution and the identity .",

    "this result verifies that the complex of meridians is not sufficient for characterizing @xmath81    for the proof of the above results we list all topological types of surfaces in the handlebody of genus @xmath0 and perform a close examination of their links in @xmath59 this examination establishes that an automorphism @xmath82 of @xmath30 must map each vertex @xmath83 in @xmath30 to a vertex @xmath84 consisting of surfaces of the same topological type as those in @xmath85 in particular , @xmath82 induces an automorphism of the subcomplex @xmath24 which permits the use of the corresponding result for surfaces ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the case of genus @xmath86",
    "this analysis can not be carried out .",
    "however , it can be useful as a basis for establishing induction in order to show that the automorphisms of the complex @xmath30 are all geometric .",
    "it is well known that for genus @xmath86 the complex of curves @xmath57 is a @xmath87hyperbolic metric space in the sense of gromov ( see @xcite,@xcite ) . from the construction of @xmath30",
    "we deduce easily that the embedding of @xmath57 in @xmath30 is isometric and @xmath30 is within bounded distance from the image of @xmath57 in @xmath88 namely , @xmath89 in consequence , the complex @xmath30 is itself a @xmath87hyperbolic metric space in the sense of gromov .",
    "moreover , it can be seen ( in similar manner as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.6 ) ) that @xmath90 does not contain parabolic elements but we do not discuss these issues here .",
    "let @xmath1 denote a @xmath2dimensional handlebody of genus @xmath23 @xmath1 can be represented as the union of a handle of index @xmath91 ( i.e. a @xmath2ball ) with @xmath92 handles of index @xmath93 ( i.e. @xmath92 copies of @xmath94   $ ] ) .",
    "we fix these handles along with ( following the standard terminology ) a longitude @xmath95 and meridian @xmath96 for each handle .    for an essential simple closed curve @xmath50 in @xmath25 we will be writing @xmath97   $ ] for its isotopy class and the corresponding vertex in @xmath48 we will be writing @xmath98   $ ] for the corresponding vertex in @xmath99 where @xmath51 is the annulus corresponding to the curve @xmath61 provided that @xmath50 is not a meridian boundary .",

    "this assumption further asserts that such a surface @xmath6 satisfies the following property    ( sp ) : :    @xmath6 separates @xmath1 into two components and the    closure of one of them , denoted by @xmath113 is    homeomorphic to a product @xmath114   $ ] with    @xmath115 and    @xmath116    consider a surface @xmath117 properly embedded in @xmath1 and arbitrarily close to @xmath32 so that @xmath117 and @xmath32 bound a subset of @xmath37 say @xmath118 homeomorphic to @xmath119   $ ] with @xmath120 and @xmath121 it clear that @xmath117 is properly isotopic to @xmath6 and we denote this isotopy by @xmath122   .$ ] by standard isotopy extension properties , see for example ( * ? ? ?",
