    "being able to describe the dynamics and dissipation of atomic systems , modelled at the nanoscale , as correctly as possible is central for modern nanoscience .",
    "nanoscale devices and materials are becoming increasingly important in the development of novel technologies .",
    "in most applications of these new nanotechnologies , the central system is part of a more complex set up where driving forces are present to establish heat and/or particle flows .",
    "the understanding of these corresponding nonequilibrium properties is of utmost importance .",
    "this is especially true when one considers potential applications based on the thermal conductivity of materials @xcite and the heat transport within nanodevices @xcite .",
    "other applications include the study of energy dissipation in solids , or at the interface between gas phase and a solid phase , and more generally in nanotribology .    in all the examples given above , one has to consider the central open system surrounded by a heat bath ( an environment ) which is in contact with the system and is kept at a given temperature .",
    "the general technique that is specifically appropriate for treating this kind of set up is based on the so - called generalised langevin equation ( gle)@xcite . the gle is an equation of motion for the non - markovian stochastic process where the particle ( point particle with mass ) has a memory effect to its velocity .    in the conventional langevin equation ,",
    "a particle is subjected to a viscous drag from the surrounding medium , characterised by some friction force , and to a stochastic force that arises because of the coupling of the particle to its surrounding .",
    "the friction constant determines how quickly the system exchanges energy with the environment . for a realistic description of the surrounding ,",
    "it is difficult to choose an universal value of the friction constant . indeed",
    "each of the vibrational modes in the system would require a different value of the friction to be sampled with optimal efficiency .",
    "hence a generalization of the conventional langevin equation is needed , thus leading to the so - called gle .",
    "whenever we are interested in computing properties of materials at constant temperatures using classical molecular dynamics , it is possible to introduce the so - called thermostats , that introduce fluctuations in the total energy consistent with the canonical gibbs sampling of the trajectories of the atoms of the considered system .",
    "the non - markovian gle represents a remarkably flexible framework which permits one to achieve a better control over the sampling properties of a molecular dynamics trajectory , to enhance its sampling efficiency for all the relevant time scales @xcite , to control in a precise manner the disturbance of the dynamics for different frequency ranges and to provide physical non - equilibrium trajectories for the study of non - equilibrium and/or relaxation processes .",
    "the gle has been derived , by one of us , for a realistic system of @xmath0 particles coupled with a realistic ( harmonic ) bath , i.e. a bath described at the atomic level @xcite .",
    "non - markovian dynamics is obtained for the central system with gaussian distributed random forces and a memory kernel that is exactly proportional to the random force autocorrelation function @xcite .",
    "solving the gle for complex heterogeneous and extended systems is still a challenge , even when it is known that the gle dynamics is fully consistent in the sense that it fulfils the chapmann - kolmogorov equations @xcite .",
    "a major step towards the solution of this problem for a realistic application has been recently given in refs .",
    "[ ] . in particular , a very efficient algorithm has been developed in ref .  [ ] to solve the gle numerically while taking into account both fundamental features of the gle , i.e. a time - dependent memory kernel and the presence of a coloured noise which are absolutely essential for a description of the bath at the atomic level .",
    "such a tool is crucial for the study of nonequilibrium processes in nanoscale systems by using molecular dynamics simulations . in the latter ,",
    "the dissipative processes can be correctly described since the system can exchange energy ( heat ) with the environment",
    ". the environment is characterised by a bath ( or several baths ) , its ( their ) own dynamical properties going beyond conventional thermostats used in classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite .    in this manuscript , we present further necessary developments and applications of the method given in ref .",
    "[ ] . specifically , we develop a method and algorithm to calculate the non - markovian memory kernel and to perform the mapping of such a kernel onto an extended langevin dynamics which permits us to solve the gle for realistic systems .",
    "the present paper is a proof of principle of the general method described in ref .  [ ] . as a first application of our method",
    ", we consider different model systems that are all based on a crystalline solid . for numerical convenience ,",
    "we model the solid using pairwise lennard - jones potentials .",
    "the calculations should be considered as a robust test of the gle and methodology rather than a purely realistic application .",
    "however , in comparison with other gle implementations , our method includes a realistic coupling between the central region and the bath which goes beyond the conventionally used bi - linear coupling . hence the extended langevin dynamics developed in ref .",
    "[ ] is described with a verlet - like algorithm which takes full account of a functional of the atomic positions of the central system ( which characterises the coupling with the bath ) .",
    "the presence of such a functional renders the extended langevin dynamics equations highly non - linear in terms of the atomic positions of the central system .",
    "the presented applications are obtained for a `` simple '' model system , but show that our scheme is stable and provide the proper description of the essential thermodynamical properties of the system , i.e. the proper thermalisation of the system , the proper temporal fluctuations of its energy , the proper canonical distributions of the velocities and the proper behaviour of the velocity autocorrelation functions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : generalisation ] , we recall the central results for the gle and how the memory kernel is connected to the polarisation matrix @xmath1 which characterises the vibrational properties of the bath .",
    "[ sec : pimatrix ] is devoted to the scheme we have developed to calculate the polarisation matrix @xmath1 and to map such a central quantity onto a specific analytical form which permits us to develop an extended langevin dynamics from the original gle . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we provide examples of the calculation and mapping of the matrix @xmath1 for a model of a lennard - jones ( lj ) solid .",
    "we then use such results to calculate the dynamics of the lj solid using our extended phase space gle dynamics ( sec .",
    "[ sec : gle_ex ] ) .",
    "we provide results for the thermalisation of the system and analyse in detail the corresponding velocity distributions and velocity autocorrelation functions .",
    "we also show how our extended gle dynamics is useful in extracting effective friction coefficients for more conventional langevin dynamics . finally , we discuss further developments and conclude our work in sec .",
    "[ sec : ccl ] .",
    "we first start to recall the physical form and contents of the gle . for clarity , we consider here a single degree of freedom ( dof ) @xmath2 with mass @xmath3 and momentum @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding gle is given by @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the potential energy , dependent only on the dof @xmath7 .",
    "the memory kernel @xmath8 is a characteristic of the bath and the random variable @xmath9 represents a stochastic process .",
    "the latter is described by a coloured noise and the autocorrelation function of the stochastic variable is directly related to the memory kernel , i.e. @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath12 the temperature of the system .    in general , it is difficult to solve the integro - differential equation ( [ eq : gle_1dof ] ) , not only because the atomic momentum needs to be known for all times in the past ( @xmath13 ) , but also because one has to generate a coloured noise @xmath9 that satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation relation given above , i.e. the relation linking the noise autocorrelation function with the memory kernel .",
    "for some specific analytic forms of the memory kernel , it is possible to solve exactly the gle by introducing extra virtual dof and working with an extended langevin dynamics ( for all the dof ) involving new stochastic variables which are then characterised by a white noise distribution @xcite .",
    "for example , this can be done with the memory kernel expressed as a sum of decaying exponentials @xmath14 [ ] . such a prony series form of the memory kernel has been used to enable an extended variable formalism in ref .  [ ] . in this case ,",
    "different characteristic times for relaxation and dissipation of energy into the bath are used .",
    "a more evolved model can be obtained by taking not only different relaxation processes but also some proper internal dynamics of the bath , i.e. the bath is also characterised by some oscillations of frequency @xmath15 . in this case",
    "the memory kernel has the following form @xmath16 with the constant @xmath17 representing the strength of the coupling between the system dof and the bath .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the generalised langevin equation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gle_1dof ] ) can be conveniently approximated ( for a certain kind of memory kernel ) by a markovian langevin dynamics ( with white noise ) by introducing a set of auxiliary dofs .",
    "this approximated equivalence becomes exact in the limit of infinitely many auxiliary dofs . for a memory kernel of the type given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kernel_model ] ) , solving the gle is equivalent to solving the following extended variable dynamics @xcite : @xmath18 where the set @xmath19 are auxiliary dof ( virtual dof - vdof , with @xmath20 ) and now the stochastic variables are of the white noise type @xmath21     in ref .  [ ] , we show how to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : gle_1dof_vdof ] ) with the white noise by using a fokker - planck ( fp ) approach .",
    "the problem is solved in a multivariate form @xcite and the corresponding probability density function is explicitly dependent on the position @xmath7 , momentum @xmath22 and auxiliary dof @xmath23 . a splitting approach for the corresponding fp propagator",
    "is then used to obtain a ( velocity ) verlet - like algorithm to solve the problem .",
    "the dissipative dynamics hence obtained is strictly equivalent to the gle .    a rigorous derivation of the gle for a complex system made of @xmath0 atoms ( with",
    "positions @xmath24 for atom @xmath25 and cartesian coordinate @xmath26 , or @xmath27 ) coupled to a realistic bath has been given by one of us in ref .",
    "[ ] . under rather general assumptions concerning the classical hamiltonian of the system , equation ( [ eq : gle_1dof ] )",
    "can be generalised to many dof to mimic the bath .",
    "two important assumptions are used in ref .",
    "[ ] : the fluctuations of the bath atom positions @xmath28 ( for bath atom @xmath29 cartesian coordinate @xmath30 ) are taken to be harmonic around their equilibrium values , and the coupling between the system and the bath is linear in the bath coordinates . the corresponding lagrangian for the interaction between the system and bath regions is given by @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the mass of the bath atom @xmath29 .",
    "hence , for an arbitrary configuration of the atoms within the system , there is a force @xmath33 acting , at time @xmath34 , on the bath dof @xmath35 due to the system - bath coupling .    under these assumptions ,",
    "( [ eq : gle_1dof ] ) is generalised for each @xmath24 and one obtains a general kernel @xmath36 which is still related to the noise autocorrelation function as @xmath37 for each noise proces @xmath38 associated with the dof @xmath24 . one should note that now the memory kernel has a full @xmath39 time dependence , and not a dependence on the time difference @xmath40 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the system is coupled to the bath via the function @xmath41 which is implicitly dependent on time .",
    "the memory kernel is expressed in the following manner @xmath42 where the quantity @xmath43 represents the full dynamics of the bath ( with indices @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath46 are obtained the forces @xmath47 such as @xmath48 .",
    "interestingly , the matrix @xmath49 follows the time translation invariance . if this matrix could be mapped onto an analytical form of the type given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kernel_model ] ) , one could develop a corresponding extended langevin dynamics for the full gle .",
    "such a mapping has been done and derived rigorously in ref .  [ ] by using @xmath50 and introducing an extra set of @xmath51 auxilliary dof @xmath52 to solve the gle in an extended phase space",
    ".    now a few comments are in order . on the one hand",
    ", it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that the matrix @xmath49 is related to the dynamical matrix of the bath .",
    "the solution of the eigenvalue problem for the dynamical matrix generates the eigenmodes of vibration of the system , with frequency @xmath53 and a corresponding time dependence in @xmath54 .",
    "such a result partially justifies the mapping of @xmath49 as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gle_mapping_vdof ] ) as far as the oscillatory behaviour in time is concerned .",
    "note that the mapping in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gle_mapping_vdof ] ) is used to transform the langevin dynamics into an extended phase space where the solution of such a dynamics is more readily accessible .",
    "the mapping in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gle_mapping_vdof ] ) does not necessarily imply that all the @xmath15 parameters associated with the virtual dof are all equal to the eigenvalues @xmath53 of the vibrational modes of the infinite bath region . crudely speaking",
    ", we can consider the @xmath15 as being the frequencies of `` collective '' or `` coarse - grained '' excitations of the bath .",
    "these excitations reduce to the normal modes of the bath when one considers as many vdof as there are dof in the ( actual infinite ) bath .",
    "on the other hand , a perturbation introduced in an isolated , finite size , harmonic system can not dissipate and the corresponding induced oscillations will survive for ever . however for an infinite system in the thermodynamic limit , such perturbation will fade away in the long time limit as the system will equilibrate and return to its thermal equilibrium . in reality , such a dampening is due to anharmonic effects ( phonon - phonon interaction ) .",
    "therefore , the exponential decay of the @xmath49 matrix is entirely justified in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "note that the relaxation times @xmath55 are not directly related to the eigenvalues @xmath15 ( e.g. like @xmath56 ) since they correspond to completely different physical processes .",
    "using the notation of ref .  [ ] and the mapping given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gle_mapping_vdof ] ) , one can generalise the extended langevin dynamics for one dof given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gle_1dof ] ) to the case of several dof in the central system . in a compact matrix form",

    "the matrix @xmath49 contains all the information about the dynamics of the bath region and is related to dynamical matrix of the bath itself .",
    "we provide more detail about @xmath76 in the following section .    the coupling matrix @xmath77 with matrix elements @xmath78 can be interpreted as a dynamical matrix between the dof of the system and the dof of the bath .",

    "the aim of the paper is to develop a robust and efficient numerical scheme to calculate the inverse of the matrix @xmath99 $ ] for an infinite bath region , or at least for a very large bath region .",
    "it is clear that direct inversion or diagonalisation of the matrix will be very time / resource consuming .",
    "furthermore , since the bath region will not generally be a fully three - dimensional periodic system , a reciprocal @xmath70-space approach is not necessarily best suited for the problem at hand .",
    "hence , we have chosen a more physically intuitive real - space approach based on tridiagonalisation scheme for inverting the matrix @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "we use the lanczos algorithm , @xmath101 where the set of coefficients @xmath102 are constructed from the iterative lanczos vectors as follows : @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( with @xmath105 , and before each iteration @xmath106 is renormalised by @xmath107 ) .",

    "we can calculate all matrix elements @xmath123 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi_matrix ] ) .",
    "another advantage of using the lanczos iterative scheme in comparison with exact diagonalisation or inversion comes from the following fact : the correct results are obtained once the coefficients of the continued fraction have converged towards an asymptotic value . for the system we have considered ( see the next section ) , the convergence is always reached for a level @xmath124 of the continued fraction much smaller than the dimension of the dynamical matrix @xmath125 .",
    "one of the reasons for that is that the range of the inter - atomic interaction is finite and therefore the off - diagonal elements of the dynamical matrix decrease with the inter - atomic distance between the bath dof @xmath126 and @xmath127 quite rapidly ( at least for a non - ionic system ) . in terms of scaling",

    "there is no reason to believe that this is a general rule and that for other systems , e.g. highly inhomogeneous , it will still be the case .",

    "our gle scheme is however applicable to much more complex systems ( i.e. highly heterogeneous , and with complex structures like bio - like molecules deposited on rough surfaces ) .",
    "the results presented in this paper should be mostly understood as a proof of principle of our methodology .    for complex systems , we expect that the bath vibrational properties will present more specific features which will lead to more specific properties of the memory kernel . in turn , the properties of such a kernel will strongly affect , by some kind of selective processes , the efficiency of some vibrational modes of the central region to exchange energy with the surrounding bath . we expect that such specific bath properties will be central in the thermalization and relaxation processes of ( small to large ) molecules grafted onto surfaces or clusters ( and into the presence or not of solvents ) .",
    "second , a large number of equilibrium thermostats has been designed up to date ( see refs .  [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "the gle can be used to provide exactly the same results as obtained from these equilibrium thermostates , albeit with a higher computational cost . however",
    ", the main advantage of the gle , as compared with the other available equilibrium thermostats , is that it is also applicable to the study of nonequilibrium processes .",
    "for instance , the gle technique is , by essence , naturally applicable for studying the phonon contribution to thermal transport through bulk materials or nano - junctions .",
    "such nonequilibrium processes can be treated by coupling the central system to more than one bath .",
    "each bath would be at its own equilibrium , and one can not define a single temperature for the whole system . in that case , the central system does not evolve towards an equilibrium state , but will eventually reach a steady state regime characterised by heat flows between the central system and the baths . to study such processes , the gle equation  ( [ eq : glematrix_form ] )",
    "can be generalised to include the nonequilibrium conditions when the different baths are independent ( i.e. not coupled to each other in any way ) .",
    "for that we simply need to extend the number of virtual dof to obtain a set of parameters @xmath248 for each bath @xmath249 at temperature @xmath250 .",
    "each bath @xmath249 will also be characterised by its own dynamical matrix and matrix elements @xmath251 .",
    "the implementation of such nonequilibrium extended langevin dynamics is currently under development .",
    "hn warmly thanks l. pizzagalli for fruitful discussions and for providing important informations about the calculations of the dynamical matrix within lammps .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the uk epsrc , under grant no .",
    "ep / j019259/1 .",
    "in ref .  [ ] it is shown that , in the time representation , the matrix @xmath49 is related to the bath propagator @xmath252 via @xmath253 .",
    "the bath propagator @xmath252 is the solution of the harmonic dynamics of the bath dof @xmath254 \\mathcal{d}_{b_1,b'}(t - t ' ) = \\delta(t - t ' ) \\delta_{b , b ' } , \\label{eq : bath_prop}\\ ] ] where @xmath122_{b , b'}$ ] are the elements of the dynamical matrix of the bath region .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath76 are given by @xcite @xmath255 where @xmath256 labels the eigenstates of the dynamical matrix @xmath96 with eigenvalues @xmath168 and eigenvectors @xmath257 with component @xmath258 in the bath region .",
    "as all quantities depend only on a single time argument , one can pass into the energy representation after using the fourier transform .",
    "the bath propagator @xmath259 is then the solution of @xmath260_{b , b_1 } \\mathcal{d}_{b_1,b'}(\\omega)=\\delta_{b , b'}\\ ] ] and @xmath261    it is now easy to find the relationship between @xmath85 and @xmath262 : @xmath263^{-1}_{b , b ' } , \\label{eq : piomegadomega}\\ ] ] by introducing a small imaginary part in @xmath264 and using the fact that @xmath265 .",
    "following the prescriptions given in ref .",
    "[ ] , we use the following algorithm for a single time - step @xmath229 . the algorithm is derived , in a verlet - style , from a different splitting and a trotter - like decomposition of the total liouvillian for the extended langevin dynamics of the system dof , @xmath24 , and the virtual dof @xmath266 .",
    "such a decomposition has been shown to provide a more appropriate description of the velocity correlation functions @xcite .",
    "algorithm : @xmath267 where the different forces , @xmath268 are explained below .",
    "the force @xmath269 is the force acting on the system dof @xmath270 due to the interaction between the atoms in the system and in the bath region(s ) ; the `` polaronic '' force @xmath271 @xmath272 ( with @xmath273 for the bath dof ) is the force acting on the system dof @xmath270 due to the interaction between the system and bath regions which induces a displacement of the positions of the harmonic oscillators characterising the bath . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpol ] ) , we used the fact that @xmath274 is the inverse fourier transform ( evaluated at @xmath275 ) of @xmath130 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mapping_pi_matrix ] ) .",
    "the force @xmath276 acts on the system dof @xmath270 and arises from the generalised langevin equations : @xmath277 and the force @xmath278 acts on the vdof @xmath279 and also arises from the generalised langevin equations @xmath280    the integration of the dissipative part of the dynamics of the vdof ( see steps ( a ) and ( f ) in the algorithm ) includes the coefficients @xmath281 and @xmath282^{1/2}$ ] and the uncorrelated random variable @xmath283 corresponding to the white noise .",
    "the gle calculations are performed for different bath temperatures @xmath12 ( in k ) and for the set of fitting parameters obtained with 48 vdof , and for a larger bath region of radius @xmath284   ( 555 atoms ) ( see a corresponding @xmath162 function given by the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : pibb_vs_bathsize ] ) .",
    "the system thermalises , as expected , to the proper equilibrium temperature after a time @xmath285 ps . the inset represents a poor fitting of the @xmath149 functions with 27 vdof , with the dashed curve representing the fit and the red curve the exact result .",
    "the corresponding gle calculations for the total kinetic energy ( blue broken line ) are shown for @xmath225 .",
    "the system thermalises much faster because the corresponding values of the @xmath55 parameters are much smaller than for the fit using 48 vdof.,width=264 ]    figure [ fig : ekintot_sphere3.2_different_fit ] shows another example of the time evolution of the total kinetic energy of the central system . for these calculations , the set of parameters @xmath193 corresponds to 48 vdof , and the mapping is performed for the larger bath region of radius @xmath284   ( 555 atoms ) ( for an example of the corresponding @xmath286 functions see the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : pibb_vs_bathsize ] ) .",
    "once more , we can observe the thermalization of the system towards the expected equilibrium thermodynamical values for the two different temperatures .",
    "however the overall dynamics is slower than in the previous two cases .",
    "such a behaviour depends on the values of the parameters @xmath193 obtained from the mapping .",
    "we would like to mention that we can perform an analysis of the temporal evolution of kinetic energy in terms of the values of the relaxation times .",
    "such an analysis is approximate , but still good enough when the spreading of the different values of the parameters @xmath55 , for a given fit , is not too large .",
    "in such a case , all @xmath55 values are almost the same .",
    "for the example of a poor fit shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ekintot_sphere3.2_different_fit ] , we have @xmath287 ps for all the 27 vdof .",
    "the corresponding total kinetic energy ( blue curve in fig .  [ fig : ekintot_sphere3.2_different_fit ] ) approaches the thermal equilibrium value more quickly than for the mapping obtained with 48 vdof .",
    "indeed , for the mapping done with 48 vdof , we have @xmath55 parameters with more spread values and an averaged relaxation time is around 2 - 3 ps which is much larger than @xmath288 ps and explains why the system ( described with the 48 vdof ) thermalises on a longer time - scale than the system described by a poor fit with 27 dof .    for the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ekintot_33vdof ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ekintot_117vdof ] , the distribution of the values of the parameters @xmath55 is substantially broader with values ranging from @xmath289 to @xmath290 ps for the mapping made with 117 vdof , and from @xmath291 to @xmath292 ps for the mapping made with 33 vdof .",
    "correspondingly , the time taken by the system to thermalize is intermediate between the thermalization times shown in figure [ fig : ekintot_sphere3.2_different_fit ] .",
