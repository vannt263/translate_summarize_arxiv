    "<S> active brownian particles are capable of taking up energy from their environment and converting it into directed motion ; examples range from chemotactic cells and bacteria to artificial micro - swimmers . </S>",
    "<S> we have recently demonstrated that janus particles , i.e. gold - capped colloidal spheres , suspended in a critical binary liquid mixture perform active brownian motion when illuminated by light . in this article , we investigate in some more details their swimming mechanism leading to active brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the illumination - borne heating induces a local asymmetric demixing of the binary mixture generating a spatial chemical concentration gradient , which is responsible for the particle s self - diffusiophoretic motion . </S>",
    "<S> we study this effect as a function of the functionalization of the gold cap , the particle size and the illumination intensity : the functionalization determines what component of the binary mixture is preferentially adsorbed at the cap and the swimming direction ( towards or away from the cap ) ; the particle size determines the rotational diffusion and , therefore , the random reorientation of the particle ; and the intensity tunes the strength of the heating and , therefore , of the motion . finally , we harness this dependence of the swimming strength on the illumination intensity to investigate the behaviour of a micro - swimmer in a spatial light gradient , where its swimming properties are space - dependent .    in recent years , </S>",
    "<S> active brownian motion has attracted a lot of interest from the biological and physical communities alike @xcite . differently from simple brownian particles , </S>",
    "<S> whose motion is dominated by random fluctuations , active brownian particles feature an interplay between random fluctuations and active swimming . </S>",
    "<S> while brownian particles are at thermal equilibrium with their environment , active brownian particles are capable of taking up energy and converting it into directed motion in a process that drives them out - of - equilibrium @xcite .    a paradigmatic example of active brownian motion is the swimming of bacteria such as _ escherichia coli _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the details may differ depending on the specific type of bacteria , their motion can be generally described as a sequence of roughly straight trajectories ( runs ) and diffusive events ( tumbles ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , bacteria can adapt their motion to the environmental conditions , thus optimizing their survival chances . in the presence of a nutrient gradient , for example , bacteria are able to move towards the higher - nutrient - concentration regions by adjusting the frequency of their tumbles @xcite , employing a food searching strategy that has been demonstrated to be optimal when the targets are diluted , sparse and able to regenerate @xcite .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> much effort has been devoted to realize artificial micro - swimmers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such micro - swimmers hold tremendous potential as autonomous agents to localize , pick - up and deliver nanoscopic objects , e.g. , in bioremediation , drug - delivery and gene - therapy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various approaches have been proposed in order to propel such artificial micro - swimmers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , micro - swimmers composed of dna - linked magnetic colloidal beads have been powered by external rotating magnetic fields which allows the fabrication of swimmers @xcite , artificial flagella @xcite or helical artificial tails @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , low - reynolds - number swimmers have also been powered using optical traps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the motion of such micro - swimmers is not autonomous but controlled by the geometry and direction of external fields , the clear advantage of such approaches is that this motion can be kept alive forever . </S>",
    "<S> a different approach deals with micro - swimmers capable of autonomous motion mimicking more closely biological entities . </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulty is related to the need for a constant energy ( fuel ) supply that the micro - swimmers have to take up from their surrounding . </S>",
    "<S> particularly successful have been various kinds of janus particles driven by self - phoretic forces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such forces are produced by a chemical ( _ self - diffusiophoresis _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , electrical ( _ self - electrophoresis _ ) or thermal ( _ self - thermophoresis _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) gradient that the particle is able to generate around itself . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , janus spheres or rods half coated by platinum and immersed in water enriched by hydrogen peroxide are propelled by a catalytic chemical reaction on the metallic surfaces @xcite ; since the hydrogen peroxide is continuously decomposed , it is necessary to adopt special experimental configurations in order to maintain a constant activation of the particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> self - thermophoretic micro - swimmers have also been demonstrated using gold - capped janus particles immersed in water @xcite : the thermophoresis occurs because the particle experience a local temperature gradient due to the light absorbed by the gold caps under illumination by a slightly focused laser beam .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , we presented a novel type of micro - swimmer whose active motion relies on the local demixing of a binary mixture which is achieved by local heating of janus particles with light ( fig.[fig1](a ) ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this system avoids the above mentioned fueling problem and even allows to study active brownian motion in patterned environments . </S>",
    "<S> so far , however , the origin of the propulsion mechanism has not been studied in detail . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate this swimming mechanism in more detail , showing that the local asymmetric demixing induced by the illumination - borne heating generates a local spatial chemical concentration gradient , which is eventually responsible for the particle s self - diffusiophoretic motion . </S>",
    "<S> we study this effect as a function of the functionalization of the gold cap , the particle size and the illumination intensity . </S>",
    "<S> we finally study a situation where the self - diffusiophoretic motion is spatially inhomogeneous by using an illumination gradient .    </S>",
    "<S> the micro - swimmers used in our experiments consist of silica spheres ( @xmath0 , microparticles gmbh , germany ) with different radii ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one side of these sphere is coated by thermal evaporation with a thin adhesion layer of chromium ( @xmath2 ) and , subsequently , with a thicker layer of gold ( @xmath3 ) . in order to control which component of the mixture </S>",
    "<S> is preferentially adsorbed at the gold surface , we render it either hydrophilic or hydrophobic by chemical functionalization with thiols terminated with either polar ( 11-mercapto - undecanoic acid ) or unpolar ( 1-octadecanethiol ) end groups . </S>",
    "<S> these janus particles are then diluted in a critical binary mixture of water and 2,6-lutidine @xcite . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) a schematic phase diagram of the mixture is shown . at the critical composition ( 0.286 mass fraction of lutidine ) and below the lower critical temperature ( @xmath4 ) </S>",
    "<S> the mixture is homogeneous , as shown by the bright - field picture in inset ( i ) of figure [ fig1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the temperature above @xmath5 , the mixture separates via spinodal decomposition as shown in inset ( ii ) of figure [ fig1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bicontinuous wormlike structure is typical of the spinodal decomposition and has been observed not only in binary fluids @xcite , but also during the phase separation of metallic alloys @xcite , glass alloy systems and polymeric blends with high molecular weight @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the critical suspension is kept a fraction of a degree below the critical point with a flow thermostat ( point a in figure [ fig1](b ) ) . the whole sample ( @xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> is then illuminated with green light at @xmath7 near the plasmonic absorption peak of gold @xcite . due to light absorption </S>",
    "<S> , the gold caps are heated above @xmath5 ; the temperature at the silica side does not change because silica does not absorb green light . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the illumination triggers the heating of the caps and , subsequently , the local demixing of the critical mixture . in our experiments , </S>",
    "<S> homogenous illumination is obtained by rapidly scanning a highly defocused ( spot radius @xmath8 ) laser beam over the entire area of the sample using an acousto - optical deflector . </S>",
    "<S> the light intensity is kept lower than @xmath9 in order to rule out optical forces , which are typically relevant only for @xmath10 at least an order of magnitude larger .    in order to better understand the heating process induced by the illumination </S>",
    "<S> , we have numerically estimated the temperature increase @xmath11 for an incident light intensity comparable with the experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> heat is generated only in the cap because of the absorption associated to the imaginary component of the dielectric constant of gold @xcite and , then , diffuses in the surrounding medium , i.e. silica sphere and water-2,6-lutidine , according to poisson heat equation . </S>",
    "<S> more in detail , we followed the approach outlined in reference @xcite : by applying the green dyadic method @xcite , we could estimate the electric field @xmath12 inside the gold cap under uniform plane - wave illumination ; then , we derived the heat power @xmath13 generated at the cap , whose temperature is assumed to be uniform due to the high heat conductivity of the gold ; and , finally , we calculated how @xmath13 diffuses in the surrounding medium using poisson heat equation and the heat conductivity of silica and water-2,6-lutidine . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath11 is independent of the base temperature of the mixture . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2 ] shows the results of the simulation of @xmath11 in the equatorial plane of a janus particle with @xmath14 0.5 ( figure [ fig2](a ) ) , 1 ( figure [ fig2](b ) ) and 2 @xmath15 ( figure [ fig2](c ) ) illuminated with green ( @xmath16 , linearly polarized ) light of @xmath17 ; brighter colors correspond to a larger @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the particles , whose contours are indicated by the dashed lines , are oriented so that the caps points to the left . </S>",
    "<S> as the particle size increases , @xmath11 becomes larger , because of the larger dissipation at the gold cap . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , we notice that @xmath18 is strongly asymmetric for all the three particle sizes and that a sharp temperature transition occurs at the edge between the capped and uncapped sides of the particle ; this asymmetry is responsible for the localization of the demixing at the cap side , for the instauration of a chemical gradient across the particle and , eventually , for the micro - swimmer self - propulsion .    </S>",
    "<S> when the temperature locally increases above @xmath5 , the binary mixture locally demixes and generates a demixed region around the janus particle . in order to understand how this demixing fuels the particle s directed motion </S>",
    "<S> , we need to visualize its size and shape . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we added a fluorescent dye ( rhodamin 6 g ) , which preferentially dissolves in lutidine , to the mixture and mapped the resulting fluorescence intensity . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we show the fluorescence intensity encoded in colour , i.e. yellow ( red ) for high ( low ) fluorescence intensity . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3](a ) shows the concentration of lutidine around a janus particle with a hydrophilic - functionalized cap . </S>",
    "<S> the cap is easily identified as the bright half - moon shape at the center of the picture . upon illumination , the lutidine gets depleted from the area nearby the cap ( red , water - rich phase ) , while it accumulates at the silica side ( yellow , lutidine - rich phase ) , which is hydrophobic ( in comparison to the hydrophilic - functionalized cap ) , thus resulting in a concentration gradient around the particle . </S>",
    "<S> the particle moves within this gradient in the direction of the lutidine - rich phase as indicated by the black arrow . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3](b ) shows the lutidine concentration around a janus particle with a hydrophobic cap . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the lutidine - rich phase ( yellow ) accumulates at the cap , while the water - rich ( red ) phase gets depleted and accumulates at the silica side , being the latter more hydrophilic than the cap . </S>",
    "<S> again , the particle moves in the resulting gradient towards the lutidine - rich phase ( arrow ) . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements confirm the self - diffusiophoresis as the driving mechanism for the observed active motion . in order to rule out other possible mechanisms of self - propulsion , in particular self - thermophoresis , we repeated these measurements in pure water ; here </S>",
    "<S> , we did not observe any directed motion under illumination intensities comparable to the ones used in our experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> after having investigated the driving mechanism , we studied the motion of such micro - swimmers by injecting a diluted suspension in a thin glass cell ( @xmath19 high ) . </S>",
    "<S> owing to gravity , the particle sediment to the bottom of the sample cell and their motion is effectively constrained to two dimenions ( for the illumination intensities considered in this work ) . </S>",
    "<S> we recorded movies at 7.5 frames / s and employed digital video microscopy to track the particle trajectories at different illumination intensities . </S>",
    "<S> when the sample is kept at a temperature far from @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath20 , the local illumination - induced heating is not sufficient to cross the spinodal line and , therefore , to induce a local demixing . increasing the illumination intensity , </S>",
    "<S> the trajectories remain brownian with a diffusion coefficient thus given by the stokes - einstein formula @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the binary fluid viscosity @xcite and @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant . </S>",
    "<S> when the base temperature of the sample is kept very close to @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath24 , the local heating is strong enough to cross the spinodal line and , thus , to induce a local demixing and to propel the particle . for smaller particle sizes , due to the lower heat power , higher </S>",
    "<S> illumination intensities are required , in agreement with the results from the simulations presented in figure [ fig2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting motion is characterized by a crossover from ballistic motion at short times to enhanced diffusion at long times , the latter due to random changes in the swimming direction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding average particle speed @xmath25 along the short time ballistic runs and the crossover time @xmath26 from the ballistic to the diffusive regime can be estimated from the mean square displacement ( msd ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig4 ] shows the resulting values . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath25 as a function of @xmath10 are plotted in figure [ fig4](a ) , where the black triangles correspond to @xmath27 , the red squares to @xmath28 and the blue circles to @xmath29 . clearly , active brownian </S>",
    "<S> motion , i.e. @xmath30 , sets in only above a certain illumination intensity threshold , which is higher for smaller particles due to their lower heat power ( see also figure [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this threshold can clearly be associated with the minimal heating necessary to cross the spinodal line where phase separation of the mixture occurs .    </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath26 are shown in figure [ fig4](b ) , [ fig4](c ) and [ fig4](d ) for @xmath31 , 1.0 and 0.5 @xmath15 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that smaller micro - swimmers tend to change direction much more frequently . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the values of @xmath26 for a given particle size are almost independent of the illumination intensity . </S>",
    "<S> these fitted values of @xmath26 agree with @xmath32 within the experimental error bars ( figure [ fig5 ] ) , where @xmath33 is the rotational diffusion of the particle . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the cap reorientation is mainly due to free rotational diffusion and remains rather unaffected by the propulsion mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this decoupling of rotational and translational motion largely simplifies corresponding numerical simulations of this system .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of tuning the active brownian motion of the micro - swimmers can be employed in various contexts . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we have harnessed the dependence of the swimming strength on the illumination intensity to investigate the behaviour of a micro - swimmer in a spatial light gradient , where its swimming properties are space - dependent ; these conditions resemble the situation of bacteria moving inside a chemical gradient . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig6](a ) shows the trajectory of a micro - swimmer moving inside a radial illumination gradient ; the radial dependence of the intensity is shown in figure [ fig6](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the particle starts from the lower left corner , where , since there is almost no light , it undergoes standard brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as the particle randomly moves closer to the center , it starts to perform active brownian motion with increasingly high @xmath25 as it approaches the high - intensity center of the gradient ; the radial dependence of @xmath25 is plotted in figure [ fig6](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the trajectories become more directed and less rough as the active motion increases .    in conclusion , we have described a self - propulsion mechanism based on the local asymmetric demixing of a critical binary mixture around a microscopic janus particle . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of this mechanism is that , since the required heating is very small ( a fraction of a kelvin ) , the active brownian motion can be easily tuned by a very weak illumination , which permits us to avoid optical forces acting on the highly asymmetric janus particles . furthermore , it is possible to control the active brownian motion of the micro - swimmers both in space and in time by employing spatial and temporal illumination patterns .    </S>",
