    "the data provided by _",
    "fermi _ on grbs in the past three years since its launch , are extreme in richness and quality .",
    "_ fermi _ new capabilities had focused attention on the prompt and early afterglow emission phases in grbs , which show rich phenomenology .",
    "both the quality and quantity of the data enable , for the first time , systematic study of these early emission phases .",
    "study of these phases is very important due to its very wide applicability : during these early phases , one studies the latest stages of the collapse and the earliest stages of the jet formation - before self - similar motion wipes the initial outflow conditions .",
    "this is also what makes this study so challenging : as no two grbs are similar , it is very difficult to draw firm conclusions which are true to _ all _ grbs .    confronting _",
    "fermi _ data with theoretical models show the deficit of the latter .",
    "the data provided by _",
    "fermi _ did not fit into any of the existing theoretical models ; in some cases , it was in contradiction to the theoretical expectations .",
    "this fact motivated new ideas , which are continuously being raised and discussed . with this respect ,",
    "the contribution of _ fermi _ is enormous - questions which were thought to be solved are proven not to be .    in this review ,",
    "i discuss some of the key _ fermi _ results , from a theoretician s perspective .",
    "i start by stating in ",
    "[ sec:2 ] what we are certain about , and then in  [ sec:3 ] what are the basic theoretical questions which need to be answered . in  [ sec:4 ]",
    "i highlight some of _ fermi s _ unexpected results , and their influence on our understanding of grbs .",
    "i then describe in ",
    "[ sec:5 ] the recent theoretical progress motivated by these results , and try to point towards additional observational signatures that could help resolve basic theoretical problems .",
    "the field of grbs is characterized by many uncertainties and a huge divergence within the grb population , both in spectral and time domains .",
    "nonetheless , after two decades of extensive research there are few basic , unquestionable facts , which are common to all grbs and should be addressed by any theoretical model .",
    "it is firm today that grbs are :    1 .",
    "transient in nature : no repetition was ever found .",
    "the duration of the prompt phase vary a lot from burst to burst , and can last between a fraction of a second to hundreds of seconds . during this phase ,",
    "the light curve is highly variable .",
    "extragalactic objects , originating at cosmological distances .",
    "3 .   very energetic , releasing ( isotropically equivalent ) energy of @xmath0  erg in @xmath1-rays alone .",
    "the observed spectrum is non - thermal . in the vast majority of bursts , it has a broken power law shape ( the `` band '' function , named after the late david band ) , peaking at sub - mev , with a fairly sharp decline at higher energies ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) . in a small fraction , about @xmath2 , photons were seen up to very high energies , @xmath3 . in few bursts there is an additional , high energy component which is not related to the original `` band '' function @xcite . 5 .   relativistic expansion : very high lorentz factor , @xmath4 is required by observations of high energy photons .",
    "this has solid confirmation by the existence of afterglow emission , which follows the interaction of the relativistic ejecta with the ambient medium .",
    "there are two populations of bursts , separated by their duration and hardness : the `` short / hard '' and the `` long / soft '' @xcite .",
    "there are firm evidence that long grbs are connected to supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indirect evidence suggest that short grbs originate from binary mergers @xcite , but no conclusive evidence yet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on these observational facts , a general framework , the grb `` fireball '' model emerged nearly two decades ago , and still serves as the main theoretical framework .",
    "the basic phases of this model are best described in terms of the _ energy flow_. the progenitor , which can be either a collapse of a massive star or merger of binaries , releases gravitational energy ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "while part ( or even most ) of this energy is released in the form of neutrinos or magnetic flux , a significant part is eventually converted to kinetic energy ( @xmath6 ) : this is the jet formation episode .    at a second stage , part of the jet kinetic energy",
    "is being dissipated ( say , fraction @xmath7 ) .",
    "several mechanisms were suggested for this dissipation , such as internal shocks @xcite or magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "uncertain part of the dissipated energy ( @xmath8 ) is used to produce population of energetic , non - thermal electrons , which emit the observed @xmath1-rays .",
    "other parts may be used to generate magnetic field , accelerate protons or simply heat the plasma .",
    "the remains of the kinetic energy is gradually released at later times , producing the observed afterglow .",
    "this general framework has two strong advantages .",
    "first , it is consistent with all past and current observations .",
    "second , the existence of the afterglow was predicted by this model , and hence its detection is a strong confirmation .",
    "this model , however , suffers several very serious drawbacks .",
    "first , the model is heuristic in nature , and many of the details of the physics are missing .",
    "for example , the details of the jet formation which result in the very high lorentz factor , @xmath9 as compared to agns , in which @xmath10 are not explained .",
    "another example relates to the physics of particle acceleration to non - thermal distribution , which , although inferred by the observations , is not well understood .",
    "other parts of the model have very little predictive power : for example , internal dissipation is required to explain the variable light curve , however , the model does not provide any prediction of the dissipation processes , such as their radii , amount of kinetic energy that is dissipated , etc .",
    "thus , major theoretical tasks are to `` fill the gaps '' in this basic framework . very broadly ,",
    "the theoretical efforts are focused on :    1 .",
    "understanding the nature of the progenitor .",
    "2 .   understanding jet launching mechanism , and the role played by @xmath11 s , photons and magnetic field in this process .",
    "3 .   the dynamics of grb jets : what causes these jets to have such a high lorentz factor , as opposed to jets in other objects , which have much lower lorentz factors ? 4 .",
    "jet composition : what is the role played by leptons , hadrons and magnetic field ?",
    "5 .   understanding the nature of the dissipation mechanism that leads to the emission of @xmath1-rays .",
    "radiative processes , and physical explanation to the broad band spectrum observed .",
    "in addition to these basic grb physics questions , other questions relate to the connection between grbs and other objects of interest , such as stellar evolution , host galaxies , binary evolution , gravitational waves , cosmic rays etc .",
    "additional questions relate to the use of grbs as probes of basic physics and cosmology : use of grbs as standard candles @xcite , providing limits on violation of lorentz invariance @xcite etc .    in the past few years",
    "there were major theoretical efforts aiming at addressing these questions .",
    "as unfortunately i am not able to summarize all of the recent works within the page limits of the current proceedings , i will focus on works which were directly influenced by recent _",
    "fermi _ results .",
    "obviously , as we are observing photons , there is no direct way to determine the answers to the questions outlined above , but these have to be deduced indirectly .",
    "after three years of operation , one can summarize _ fermi _ key results as follows .",
    "the detection rate of the gbm detector is @xmath12 bursts / year , which is about the expected rate .",
    "however , the lat detected only @xmath13 bursts / year , namely @xmath14 of gbm bursts are observed in the lat energy range ( @xmath15 ; see omodei s talk ) .",
    "this fraction is significantly lower than the pre - launch expectations ; however , as will be discussed below , these expectations were based on mathematical extrapolation of lower energy data , which did not carry strong physical reasoning . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that @xmath3 photons were observed can be translated , via the opacity argument @xcite into a stringent constraint on the lorentz factor of ( lat ) bursts , @xmath16 , which is higher than previously thought .",
    "the spectral properties of the vast majority of _ fermi _ bursts are very similar to the spectral properties of the _ cgro - batse _ bursts .",
    "most gbm bursts are well fitted with a `` band '' function , peaking at sub - mev .",
    "the low energy spectral index is , on the average , somewhat harder than that of the _ batse _ bursts , yet within the errors ( photon index @xmath17 vs. @xmath18 for the bright bursts)@xcite .",
    "lat bursts , on the other hand , show a different behavior .",
    "several bursts show evidence for a separate , extra high energy component , that is not part of the original `` band '' fits .",
    "this was observed both in long bursts ( e.g. , grb090902b ) @xcite and in short bursts ( e.g. , grb090510 ) @xcite .",
    "however , this was not observed in the majority of the lat bursts @xcite : for example , the spectrum of grb080916c did not show evidence for an extra component @xcite .",
    "these qualitative spectral differences are showen in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "it should be stressed that such differences could not have been seen by _ batse _ , due to its limited spectral coverage , @xmath19 .    in spite of the fairly low statistics ,",
    "a clear trend had emerged : in most ( but not all ) bursts the high energy ( lat ) photons arrive at a _ delay _ of few seconds with respect to the lower energy ( gbm ) photons . this delay is observed in both long and short grbs : e.g. , the long grb080916c , and the short grb090510 .",
    "in addition to the delay in the onset of the high energy photons , another important result is their extension to late times : lat photons are observed to be long - lived .",
    "high energy photons are frequently continuously observed for few seconds after the decay of the low energy ( gbm ) photons .",
    "both these features are demonstrated by the temporal behavior of grb090510 presented in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the fact that the low energy spectral index is , on the average , similar to the low energy spectral index observed by the _ batse _ , implies that it is too hard to be accounted for by ( optically - thin ) synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "this serves as a strong motivation for alternative scenarios .",
    "recently , several works considered the effect of inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering on the _ synchrotron _ spectra @xcite . due to the klein - nishina suppression , energetic electrons are cooled less efficiently than low energy electrons , resulting in a hardening of the electrons distribution",
    ". the resulting synchrotron emission can be as hard as @xmath20 under the appropriate conditions .",
    "a lot of theoretical attention was given to contribution from the photosphere , which is arguably the most natural explanation to the hard slopes observed , being inherent to the `` fireball '' model @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is very appealing : while no combination of synchrotron spectra can produce slopes harder than @xmath21 ( in the `` slow cooling '' regime ) or @xmath22 ( in the `` fast cooling '' regime ) , it is possible to produce the harder `` band '' function by broadening planck spectra .",
    "thus , in recent years , theoretical research in this field was focused on mechanisms that can broaden planck spectrum .",
    "spectral broadening can be achieved in two ways .",
    "first , energy dissipation below the photosphere produces a population of non - thermal electrons , which emit radiation .",
    "such a dissipation can result from internal shocks , magnetic reconnection or collisional heating .",
    "since the dissipation is assumed to take place in region of high optical depth , multiple compton scattering dominates the spectra , which can be broader than planck if the optical depth is not too high .",
    "this scenario gained broad interest recently @xcite .",
    "second , broadening is caused by contribution of off - axis emission @xcite . while off - axis photons are sub - dominant as long as the inner engine is active , they broaden the planck spectrum .",
    "they become dominant once the inner engine decays .",
    "quantitative results depend on the jet geometry .    on the observational side , following pioneering works by _",
    "@xcite , in recent years there are several successful attempts to identify a thermal ( planck ) component in existing broad - band spectra @xcite .",
    "such a `` pure '' planck spectra can be expected if ( i ) energy dissipation occurs very deep in the flow or only outside the photosphere , and ( ii ) the photospheric radius is close to the coasting radius , so that adiabatic energy losses are small .",
    "the clear identification of this component , albeit in only a limited number of bursts , is a strong motivation for continuous theoretical research .",
    "understanding the origin of the high energy ( lat ) emission is difficult , because of the confusing results : while in many lat bursts ( e.g. , grb080916c ) the high energy component smoothly connects to the low energy part , and is part of the `` band '' function , in others ( e.g. , grb090902b ) it is spectrally separated ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "clearly , emission from the photosphere can not , by itself , explain a separated spectral component at these energies .",
    "thus , within the context of the photospheric emission models , a second episode of energy dissipation above the photosphere is required in order to explain @xmath23gev emission .",
    "inclusion of this additional dissipation can provide very good fits to the data @xcite .",
    "this scenario is thus consistent with a separation of the spectral component ( as in grb09092b ) , as well as with the observed delay of the high energy component .",
    "alternatively , the spectral separation of this component may result from a different origin : it was suggested by several authors that while the `` band '' part has a leptonic origin , the high energy part may have hadronic origin @xcite , or may originate from an expanding `` cocoon '' @xcite .",
    "many lat grbs show high energy emission which seems to be smoothly connected to the low energy part , hinting towards common origin ( e.g. , grb80916c ) .",
    "the temporal evolution of the decay at these energies , @xmath24 is consistent with having external origin .",
    "thus , it was proposed by several authors @xcite that the high energy component results from energy dissipation by the external shock , similar to the afterglow emission .",
    "thus , according to this view , the high energy emission is in fact part of the afterglow emission , which naturally explains the extension of the emission to late times . on the other hand",
    ", a detailed spectral analysis showed that at least part of the gev emission must have internal origin @xcite .",
    "moreover , the smooth spectral extrapolation to the low energy part ( the sub mev peak and below ) implies that either the low energy part also has an external origin , in which case it is difficult to explain the hardness of the spectral slopes , or that both components `` conspire '' to smoothly match . over all",
    ", the origin of the gev emission is still uncertain , and more data is needed .      as photospheric emission is an inherent part of the classical , baryonic `` fireball '' model , the fact that it is not observed in most bursts challenges this model .",
    "the lack of observed photospheric signal in grb080916c was used to argue in favor of magnetically - dominated outflow @xcite .",
    "this idea has a firm theoretical basis .",
    "significant developments in numerical grmhd codes in the past few years enabled a detailed study of jet launching @xcite .",
    "these works mark the first steps towards realization of the @xcite and @xcite mechanisms , in which the magnetic field plays a crucial role as energy mediator in jet production .",
    "thus , if indeed these are the jet launching mechanisms that work in nature , one expects highly magnetized outflow , @xmath25 close to the jet - launching site . here",
    ", @xmath26 is the ( electro- ) magnetic energy density and @xmath27 is the baryon density .    motivated by these results , in recent years",
    "there were numerous attempts to study the properties of magnetized outflows . while studies in this field are not new and were done prior to _ fermi _ era ( e.g. , @xcite ) , _",
    "fermi s _ recent results stimulated a renewed interest .",
    "research in this field is currently focused on bridging the theoretical gaps in all aspects of magnetized jet physics : ( i ) creation of relativistic jets in magnetars @xcite ; ( ii ) dynamics , energy dissipation and efficiency of magnetic reconnection and magnetized shock waves @xcite ; ( iii ) particle acceleration in magnetized outflows @xcite , and ( iv ) the resulting radiative signature @xcite .",
    "while the current picture is far from being complete , this is a very active research field",
    ".    finally , detection of high energy photons imply , using the opacity argument , high lorentz factor , @xmath28 in few lat bursts @xcite .",
    "these values are more than an order of magnitude higher than the typical lorentz factor in agns , @xmath10 , and are not theoretically understood .",
    "several works in recent years were focused on finding new methods to determine the lorentz factor @xcite , and to find better constraints on the lorentz factor of the outflow . indeed , a more advanced analysis using the assumption of multi - zone emission , or taking geometrical corrections showed that the lorentz factor may not be as high , and may be limited to few hundreds @xcite .",
    "_ fermi _ results focused attention on the _ prompt _ emission phase in grbs , which is rich in phenomenology , and is poorly understood .",
    "while the general `` fireball '' framework that was constructed during the 90 s still holds , a lot of gaps in the theoretical understanding still exist .    in recent years",
    "significant theoretical progress was made in understanding the physics of the prompt emission .",
    "i highlighted here a few active research areas in which , to my opinion , _ fermi _ results were very influential .    1 .   _ progenitor , jet launching and composition_. a renewed interest in magnetized models and magnetars as grb progenitors had emerged , largely stimulated by recent _ fermi _ results .",
    "research is focused on all aspects of ( relativistic ) magnetized outflows , from jet launch , dynamics to the observed signal .",
    "radiative processes and spectral properties_. a lot of effort was given to understanding the role played by photospheric emission , and in particular mechanisms that can be used to broaden planck spectrum , so that it will resemble the observed `` band '' spectra .",
