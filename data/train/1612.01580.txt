    "statistical studies on large samples of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have proven to be valuable tools to understand the agn phenomenon ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ongoing and future large ",
    "scale extragalactic surveys require more appropriate , rapid , and flexible tools to properly reduce and statistically analyse the vast amounts of already available and incoming data . for agn",
    ", some examples of key quantities to extract from the data are the composite broad  band seds @xcite , composite optical / uv spectra @xcite , or the compilation of catalogs of spectral properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these works allow to highlight specific features of large samples , which are typically hidden when considering individual sources .",
    "the data analysis procedures employed so far , even if meticulously described , have been very often based on `` private '' algorithms , which do not allow other groups to replicate the analysis , check for inconsistencies , customize the procedure for specific needs , or apply the analysis recipes to new data .",
    "nevertheless , the employed software is ( at least ) good enough to produce results worth a publication , therefore it is likely good enough to be publicly released .",
    "moreover , the availability of a well tested software to perform data analysis may help to standardize the analysis recipes , which would otherwise be heterogeneously developed , and the results possibly hard to compare directly . in the field of x  ray data analysis a very important example of such a standardization of analysis recipes is the xspec package , which allowed researchers to focus on the interpretation of results , instead of dealing with the many technical details of the analysis procedures .    in the field of optical / uv agn",
    "spectral analysis there is not yet a commonly accepted and widely used software tool to estimate the relevant spectral quantities , namely the agn continuum luminosities , the slopes , the emission line widths , luminosities , etc . although several works have tackled the problem of estimating these quantities . for instance",
    "the software by @xcite requires data from ir to x ",
    "rays and do not provide emission lines estimates . the works by , e.g. @xcite and @xcite provide the same estimates provided by qsfit , but they did not release the software code .    in this work we present , and make publicly available to the community , our new and extensively tested software named qsfit ( _ quasar spectral fitting _ package ) . in its first release ( version 1.0 ) the software provides estimates of the spectral quantities by simultaneously fitting all components ( agn continuum , emission lines , host galaxy , iron blended lines ) of the observed optical spectrum .",
    "the software is written in idl , and it is released under the gpl license (  [ sec : qsfit ] ) .",
    "currently it only operates on spectra observed by the sloan digital sky survey , data release 10 ( sdss  dr10 ) and works non ",
    "interactively , in order to provide the simplest possible interface to the user . however , qsfit can be customized for specific needs , and can be extended to analyze spectra from other data sources or other detectors , e.g. to perform a spectral analysis using both optical and uv data . the ultimate purpose of qsfit is to allow astronomers to run standardized recipes to analyze the agn data , in a simple , replicable and shareable way .    in this work",
    "we also present a catalog of spectral quantities obtained by running qsfit on a sample of 71,251 type 1 agn at @xmath0 observed by sdss ",
    "all data in the catalog , as well as the plots with best fitting model and residuals , and the idl code required to replicate all our data analysis , are available online .",
    "our catalog is similar to the one from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s11 ) , although the data analysis follows a different approach (  [ sec : cmps11 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we perform a comparison of our results with those from s11 in order to assess the reproducibility of the results in both catalogs , and discuss the differences .",
    "finally , we check whether the agn continuum slopes with qsfit show any trend with the redshift .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : qsfit ] we present the qsfit software in detail ; in  [ sec : catalog ] we discuss the type 1 agn sample and the data analysis employed to build the qsfit catalog ; in  [ sec : cmps11 ] we compare our results with those of s11 and in  [ sec : slopes ] we analyze the reliability of qsfit continuum slopes ; in  [ sec : conclusion ] we discuss our results and draw our conclusions . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : qsfitmanual ] we discuss the procedures for qsfit installation , usage and customization .    in this work",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath1cdm cosmology with @xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( exactly the same as s11 ) .",
    "qsfit ( version 1.0 ) is an idl package to perform agn spectral analysis at optical / uv wavelengths .",
    "it is `` free software , '' released under the gpl license , and available for download on github .",
    "qsfit operates on the optical spectrum of a single source and provides estimates of : agn continuum luminosities and slopes at several rest frame wavelengths ; luminosities , widths and velocity offsets of 20 emission lines ( , m , , , etc . )",
    "; luminosities of iron blended lines at optical and uv wavelengths ; host galaxy luminosities at 5500 ( for sources with @xmath6 ) . beyond the spectral quantities",
    ", the software also provides several `` quality flags '' to assess the reliability of the results .",
    "the purpose is similar to that of previous works on agn spectral analysis , but we followed a different approach : instead of focusing on a single emission line and estimate the continuum in the surrounding region , we fit all the components simultaneously using an agn continuum component which extends over the entire available spectrum .",
    "the latter is thus a probe of the actual agn continuum , whose estimates are scarcely influenced by localized features in the spectrum .",
    "the model used to fit the data is a collection of several individual `` components '' , each representing a specific ingredient of the observed optical / uv spectrum .",
    "the current list of employed components is as follows :",
    "agn continuum (  [ sec : comp - continuum ] ) : we use a single smoothly broken power  law to describe the agn continuum over the entire ( rest  frame ) wavelength coverage ; 2 .   host galaxy (  [ sec : comp - galaxy ] ) : we use the template of an elliptical galaxy component to account for the host galaxy contribution ( this component is relevant only for sources with @xmath6 ) ; 3 .   iron blended emission lines (  [ sec : comp - iron ] ) : we used the iron template from @xcite and @xcite at optical and uv wavelengths respectively ; 4 .",
    "emission lines (  [ sec : comp - lines ] ) : we used a gaussian profile to represent all the emission lines ( either `` narrow '' , `` broad '' , or a sum of the two ) in the spectrum . beyond the `` known '' emission lines expected to be relevant in the considered wavelength range ( see tab .  [ tab : knownline ] ) , we also considered a list of `` unknown '' emission lines , i.e. not a priori associated to any known line (  [ sec : comp - linesunk ] ) . by considering these further components we may account for the lack of an iron template in the wavelength range 31003500 , or for asymmetric profiles in known emission lines .",
    "the actual model is the sum of all the above mentioned components .",
    "no absorption line is considered , since its parameters would be highly degenerate with either host galaxy or agn continuum components .",
    "qsfit relies on the mpfit @xcite procedure as minimization routine : during the fitting process the component s parameters are varied until the differences between the data and the model are minimized , following a levenberg ",
    "marquardt least  squares minimization algorithm .",
    "currently , qsfit operates only on sdss ",
    "dr10 spectra of sources whose redshift is @xmath0 ( to avoid the absorptions troughs in the neighborhood of the hydrogen lyman@xmath7 line ) .",
    "the whole analysis process can be modified to analyze spectra from other sources , or to customize the fitting recipe (  [ sec : qsfitmanual ] ) .",
    "the details of the fit procedure will be discussed in  [ sec : fit - proc ] and  [ sec : reduction ]",
    ".        * @xmath8 [  ] : wavelength ; * @xmath9 [ hz ] : frequency ; * @xmath10 [ @xmath11  erg  s@xmath3 @xmath3 ] : luminosity density ; * @xmath13 [ @xmath11  erg  s@xmath3 ] : emission line integrated luminosity , continuum @xmath14 or @xmath15 luminosities , etc . ;",
    "* @xmath16 agn spectral slope , defined as @xmath17 ; * and [  ] : minimum and maximum rest frame wavelength in the considered spectrum ; * fwhm and v@xmath18 [ km s@xmath3 ] : full width at half maximum and velocity offset of emission lines .",
    "both values are calculated as the width / displacement of the emission line , normalized by the reference wavelength , and multiplied by the speed of light .",
    "positive values of v@xmath18 means the line is blue  shifted .        the agn broad  band continuum is modeled as a smoothly broken power law in the form : @xmath19}^{s/\\gamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the break wavelength , @xmath21 is the luminosity density at @xmath22 , @xmath16 is the spectral slope at @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the slope change at @xmath25 , @xmath26 is either @xmath27 or @xmath28 , depending on the sign of @xmath24 , and @xmath29 is the curvature parameter . when @xmath23 or @xmath30 eq.[eq - sbpl ] reduces to : @xmath31 the change of slopes occurs between the wavelengths @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) such that : @xmath36 hence @xmath29 controls the `` sharpness '' of the change in slope . in the current qsfit",
    "implementation the @xmath21 parameter is constrained to be positive ; @xmath20 is constrained in the range @xmath37 , @xmath38 $ ] ; @xmath16 is constrained in the range [ @xmath39 , 2 ] ; @xmath40 is constrained in the range [ @xmath41 , 0.2 ] since we do not expect larger changes in agn continuum within the wavelength range observed by sdss ; @xmath29 is fixed to 100 since the sdss spectral resolution do not allow to provide better constraints to the curvature parameter .",
    "the agn continuum component extends through the whole observed wavelength hence the luminosity and slopes estimates are scarcely influenced by localized features in the spectrum , and are assumed to be reliable probes of the actual shape of the `` real '' agn continuum .",
    "the host galaxy may contribute to the observed luminosity of an agn , especially at optical / ir wavelengths .",
    "therefore it is necessary to disentangle the contribution of the host galaxy from the agn continuum to provide reliable estimates of the latter .",
    "this can be done reliably since galaxy spectra show a well defined change of slope between 3000  and 6000 , corresponding to the wien s tail of black body spectra from stars , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : galtempl ] .",
    "this change of slope is easily detected in sdss spectra of low ",
    "luminosity , low redshift ( @xmath42 ) agn ( e.g. fig . 3 in @xcite ) and can be used in automatic fitting procedures to estimate the host galaxy contribution .",
    "the template is normalized at 1 at 5500 , hence the value of the normalization parameter is the luminosity density at 5500 of the host galaxy at 5500 .",
    "we chose the elliptical template since luminous agn ( as those considered in the qsfit catalog ,  [ sec : catalog ] ) are likely hosted in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , by choosing the spiral template in @xcite the slope estimates would have been scarcely influenced , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "modeling of both broad and narrow ( permitted and forbidden ) iron lines is essential for a proper estimate of broad  band continuum and contaminated lines ( such as and ) , especially if the source shows small widths of broad lines @xcite .          to compare the observed data with the optical iron template we prepared a grid of templates , each with its own value of fwhm . to generate each template we sum a gaussian profile ( of the given fwhm ) for each line listed in tables a.1 and a.2 of @xcite ( excluding the hydrogen balmer lines ) .",
    "the relative line intensities are fixed to those reported in the tables , and the final template is normalized to 1 .",
    "hence , the model parameters are the width of the lines ( which identifies a template in our grid ) and its overall normalization .",
    "the `` broad '' and `` narrow '' templates ( tables a.1 and a.2 respectively ) are kept separated , each with its own parameters .",
    "the fwhm in our grid vary from 10@xmath43 to 10@xmath44 km s@xmath3 for the broad templates , and from 10@xmath45 to 10@xmath43 km s@xmath3 for the narrow templates . a plot of the iron template , for three values of fwhm ( 10@xmath43 , 3@xmath46 and 10@xmath44 km s@xmath3 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : optiron ] .",
    "the sdss spectral resolution is not sufficient to provide robust constraints to the fwhm values , hence we keep it fixed at 3000 km s@xmath3 for the broad component and to 500 km s@xmath3 for the narrow component .",
    "these constraints can be relaxed when using data with higher spectral resolution .",
    "we found that the behavior in the fit actually depends on how large is the overlap between the iron template and the considered spectrum , i.e. on the redshift of the considered source .",
    "this is a consequence of the template spanning a rather large wavelength range , and of the absence of information in the range 27702820(due to the strong emission line ) . in order to remove such dependency on the redshift we decided to split the template in four wavelength ranges :        the original template is based on the observations of i zw 1 ,",
    "whose fwhm of broad lines is 900 km s@xmath3 . to adapt the template to sources with broader emission lines we prepared a grid of broadened and normalized templates by convolving the original one with a set of gaussian profiles , whose fwhm range from 10@xmath43 to 2@xmath47 km s@xmath3 . in this case",
    "there is no separation between `` broad '' and `` narrow '' contributions since the original template in @xcite is the sum of both . a plot of the four parts , for three values of fwhm ( 10@xmath43 , 3@xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "km s@xmath3 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uviron ] .",
    "the model parameters , for each of the four parts discussed above , are the integral luminosity in the corresponding wavelength range , and the fwhm of the profile used to broaden the template .",
    "the fwhm values are constrained in the range 10@xmath4310@xmath44 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the sdss spectral resolution is not sufficient to provide robust constraints to the fwhm value , hence we keep it fixed at 3000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this constraint can be relaxed when using data with higher spectral resolution .",
    "the broad and narrow emission lines considered in qsfit are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : knownline ] .",
    "each line is modeled with a gaussian profile , whose fitting parameters are the total ( integrated ) line luminosity , the fwhm and velocity offset ( with respect to the reference wavelength ) of the line profile .",
