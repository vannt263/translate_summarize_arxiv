    "strong support for the existence of stripes in high-@xmath0 cuprates , and other transition - metal oxides , has been provided by many experiments @xcite .",
    "this leads to the question : do stripe correlations help , hinder , or even possibly create the pairing instability that leads to superconductivity ? in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that at least one feature of stripelike correlations strongly enhances the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath0 .    a previous examination of the magnetic properties of the very weakly doped cuprates @xcite modeled the observed experimental support for stripe correlations @xcite using an effective hamiltonian in which a ( spatially ) anisotropic exchange interaction was implemented to represent the stripe - induced magnetic energy scales . that is , in the direction parallel to the stripes the full local @xmath7 exchange would be present , while perpendicular to the stripes a reduced exchange would be encountered across such stripes . renormalized hamiltonians of a similar simplifying spirit were also used in other studies of the doped cuprates @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper we introduced a model that mimics one aspect of the stripe correlations by incorporating an anisotropic hopping hamiltonian @xcite ; that is , carriers are expected to be able to move much more readily along the direction of the stripes , so - called rivers of charge @xcite , than perpendicular to the stripes . allowing the carriers to interact via heisenberg superexchange ( using a two - dimensional @xmath8 model ) , and excluding double occupancy ( @xmath9 ) , we have found exact solutions for the two electron bound - state problem , _ viz .",
    "_ , in the dilute electron density limit .",
    "our calculations demonstrated how stripelike hopping anisotropies can produce ( i ) a vanishing value for the threshold exchange coupling , @xmath10 , that is required for the stabilization of two - particle bound states , and ( ii ) a dramatic increase in the two - electron binding energies @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation of these results is particularly interesting  for the same problem in either one dimension , or in two dimensions with isotropic hopping , a critical superexchange of @xmath11 is obtained .",
    "however , in the extreme anisotropy limit the electrons are confined to hop in only one lattice direction , and for such a system we found that an infinitesimal @xmath12 produces bound states .",
    "the explanation of this result follows from recognizing that in the bound state the two electrons will travel in opposite directions on near - neighbour  chains \" , and when they are on near neighbour sites , and have anti - parallel spins , a @xmath13 spin exchange interaction flips the chains on which the electrons are travelling .",
    "an infinitesimal @xmath12 using this mechanism is sufficient to produce a two - electron pair .",
    "it is appropriate to think of this result as binding produced by dimensional confinement .",
    "this interesting result naturally leaves us with the task of investigating the transition to a superconducting phase in a system with a nonzero electronic density as the system undergoes a crossover from a two - dimensional to a 1 + 0@xmath14-dimensional system induced by hopping anisotropies .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of our investigation on the effects of such stripelike hopping anisotropies on @xmath0 .",
    "we use the non self - consistent thouless criterion @xcite to determine @xmath0 , a procedure that is known to reproduce the bcs result for the superconducting transition temperature @xcite .",
    "we find a dramatic enhancement of @xmath0 the greater the degree of hopping anisotropy , and the maximum @xmath0 obtained is found to saturate in the extreme anisotropy limit . for certain system parameters , this enhancement can be of the order of 1000 !",
    "thus , this simple model of hopping anisotropy , which may be an essential ingredient to stripe correlations , provides a robust demonstration supporting the conjecture that stripes can indeed augment pairing correlations .",
    "we model stripelike hopping anisotropy in a square lattice of strongly interacting electrons using the following @xmath15 model : @xmath16 in this hamiltonian , the sites of a two - dimensional square lattice of size @xmath17 with periodic boundary conditions are labeled by the indices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the hopping integrals and exchange couplings between sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , @xmath22 is the annihilation operator for electrons at site @xmath18 of spin @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the number operator for electrons at site @xmath18 with spin @xmath23 , and @xmath25 is the on - site hubbard energy .    the most familiar strong - coupling variant of the hubbard model is the @xmath26 model , and the physics of ( square lattice ) doped mott insulators described by this model was reviewed by dagotto @xcite . as emphasized by , _",
    "e.g. _ , anderson @xcite , a vital component of the @xmath26 hamiltonian is the constraint of no double occupancy .",
    "that is , in the @xmath26 model one does not use the electron creation and annihilation operators of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tju ] ) , but rather one uses constrained creation and annihilation operators ( for example , see the discussions in ref .",
    "however , the above @xmath1 hamiltonian can be used to accomplish this same mathematical projection by taking @xmath27  this simplifying approach has been noted by a variety of researchers ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and will also be used by us .    in this paper",
    "we restrict @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be nonzero for near neighbours ( nn ) only .",
    "further , as we did in ref .",
    "@xcite , we allow the hopping integral in the @xmath28 direction , @xmath29 , to be different than the hopping integral in the @xmath30 direction , @xmath31 . we have also investigated the physics that arises when @xmath32 is allowed to be different than @xmath33 , but find that no qualitatively new physics arises as long as both @xmath32 and @xmath33 remain nonzero .",
    "thus , from now on we set @xmath34 , and we analyze the resulting hopping anisotropy problem in terms of @xmath35 thus , we have three dimensionless energy scales in the problem , _ viz . _ , @xmath36 , @xmath12 , and @xmath37 ; the @xmath38 limit reduces this number to two .",
    "we use the non self consistent thouless criterion@xcite to identify the temperature at which our system becomes unstable with respect to a low temperature superconducting phase . to this end , we determine the equation for the two - particle vertex , or effective interaction , in the singlet channel . it is known that at low electron densities@xcite one may evaluate the vertex function via the ladder approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation , and the lack of convergence of the sum of the ladder diagrams identifies the critical temperature , _ viz . _ when the sum converges the system should be in the normal state .",
    "the non self consistent formulation of the ladder approximation allows us to work exclusively in the normal state , and has been shown to lead to an identical transition temperature to that found in the bcs theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "thus , we focus on evaluating the effective interaction @xmath40 when all particle - particle diagrams are included . the integral equation for this function in this approximation can be written as ( note that we only need to consider @xmath41 @xcite , and to eliminate the proliferation of spin indices in the equations that follow from now on we suppress all spin dependencies from our equations ) @xmath42 the above integral equation is known as the bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation @xcite , and the various functions appearing in this equation are defined as follows : @xmath43 is the zeroth order single - particle greens function defined by , @xmath44 the fermionic matsubara frequencies are given by @xmath45 ; for our anisotropic hopping model the single particle dispersion of non - interacting band electrons is given by , @xmath46 @xmath47 is the chemical potential .    to proceed to the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation",
    ", we need to reduce it according to symmetries .",
    "that is , the anisotropy that is present in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tju ] ) when @xmath48 reflects a lowering of the point group symmetry of the system from that of a square to that of a rectangle .",
    "recall that the basis functions corresponding to the relevant irreducible representations of the two - dimensional square lattice are 1 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which correspond to on - site @xmath3-wave , extended @xmath3-wave , and @xmath4-wave gap symmetries , respectively .",
    "then note that in our anisotropic model these symmetries are mixed and map onto the fully symmetric @xmath51 irreducible representation of the rectangular point group . as a result , it is helpful to decompose the interaction , in the singlet channel ( even in @xmath52 ) , according to the basis functions of @xmath51 of the rectangular point group symmetry .",
    "that is , we artificially set @xmath53 , analyze the resulting interaction in terms of a linear combination of the @xmath51 basis functions of 1 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , and then , in the last step of the calculation , restore the square lattice symmetry of the superexchange interaction by resetting @xmath56 .    following this prescription , and focussing on singlet pairing",
