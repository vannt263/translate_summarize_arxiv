    "it is believed that these topological excitations are of importance in the understanding of static and dynamical properties of 2d afm .",
    "the paper is devoted to another topological structures that may occur in the system .",
    "their appearance may be argued for the following reasonings .",
    "the twofold degeneracy in the direction of antiferromagnetic vector is a source for formation of a domain structure with domain walls between n@xmath6el - like ground states .",
    "the domain walls have an energy scaling with a linear size of the system .",
    "apart from the domain structure formation there is another reason for the field @xmath7 to be inhomogeneous .",
    "one may assume an appearance of a helical coreless spin texture between two uniform n@xmath6el - like ground states which is a topological excitation , soliton , with finite energy .",
    "first , this idea has been proposed in the study of spin properties of quantum hall ( qh ) states .",
    "a formation of low - energy topological excitations localized in the domain walls between oppositely polarized domains has been considered in the investigation of a multidomain structure in a ferromagnetic qh liquid.@xcite later , it has been shown that qh ferromagnets ( qhf ) with vanishing zeeman energy and a pronounced spin - orbit coupling are unstable concerning to the formation of a helical state.@xcite recently , a similar approach has been recurred for a qh ising ferromagnet at even filling factor.@xcite in the presence of domains between ferromagnetic and unpolarized ground states , charge excitations can be trapped in the walls forming confined isospin textures , charged solitons at the domain wall . due to nonzero spin - orbit coupling the finite energy of such a soliton has been found to be rather small .",
    "the excitations with the same structure have been analyzed for a 2d heisenberg ferromagnet.@xcite contrary to qhf they carry no electrical charge and they are energetically expensive .",

    "these patterns have been observed experimentally.@xcite    guided by the arguments we predict an appearance of stationary stripelike coreless textures with an inner incommensurability in 2d antiferromagnet .",
    "these textures may be viewed as excitations whose scale along one direction in the plane coincides with the incommensurate periodicity and , in other direction , they have soliton ( kink ) features .",
    "by using a continuum approximation we classify these excitations and find conditions needed for their appearance .",
    "we reveal that for the most important types of the textures a space behavior of staggered magnetization along one of the plane directions is akin to arrangement of order parameter ( angular moment of pair ) in coreless vortices of @xmath8 phase , namely , in mermin - ho ( mh ) @xcite and anderson - toulouse ( at ) @xcite vortices .",

    "the @xmath140 dependence exhibits a skyrmion - like behavior : @xmath141 and @xmath142 [ fig.[flip](d ) ] .",
    "these features are easily explained by a symmetrical deviation of the sublattice magnetizations from parallel arrangement [ fig.[flip]e ] . at last , we note that for small applied fields ( @xmath88 ) an appearance of the spin - flop texture leads to a great loss in energy of the system .",
    "these solutions are similar to instanton - like excitations with a point singularity for systems with an axial symmetry @xcite .",
    "indeed , one of the variables , for example @xmath77 , is determined according to eq.([angle12 ] ) by another variable @xmath143 which can be taken arbitrarily in the range @xmath144 .",
    "these solitons may exist only at line ( [ critlin ] ) and require fulfillment of condition @xmath145 .",
    "an instanton nature of these excitations lays in the fact that they provide a gradual transition from collinear antiferromagnetic stripe textures , @xmath146 and @xmath100 kinks , to the spin - flop excitations , @xmath147 and @xmath128 kinks .",

    "the dipole disorder leads to a simple renormalization of the spin stiffness which in its turn leads to a finite correlation length already at @xmath154 .",

    "an effective `` magnetic field '' @xmath164 originating from the nonzero stripe velocity is responsible for an appearance of noncompensated ferromagnetic moments inside the stripe . on the other hand ,",
    "the movement provides a mechanism of dynamical stabilization of the new spin texture [ eq.([dynstab ] ) ] .",
    "the latter is directly analogous to the scheme of `` rotating bucket '' used in experiments with liquid helium.@xcite under this rotation , the formation of vortices is , in principle , a consequence of thermal equilibrium . above a critical rotation frequency @xmath179 , the term @xmath180 in the hamiltonian @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the hamiltonian in the absence of rotation , can favor the creation of a state where the condensate wave function has an angular momentum along @xmath19 axis and therefore contains a vortex filament.@xcite the stripe spin texture moving with the velocity @xmath160 provides a minimum of the functional @xmath183 . due to this reason ,",
