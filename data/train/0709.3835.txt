    "the concept of entanglement is at the root of the field of quantum information science .",
    "entanglement is thought to render the envisioned quantum computer more powerful than its classical counterpart , and has in some sense to be present to make sure that one can distill a secure classical key in quantum key distribution . yet ,",
    "entangled quantum states are not defined via their immediate usefulness for quantum information purposes , but rather via the way they are prepared : a quantum state is called _ entangled _ if it is not merely _ classically correlated _ ,",
    "so if it can not be prepared  in a in a distributed laboratories paradigm  with local quantum operations alone , making use of classical shared randomness @xcite .",
    "these classically correlated states are hence exactly those states that can be prepared with local distributed physical devices .",
    "this definition in terms of the very preparation procedure , needless to say , does not imply per se the usefulness of the entanglement .    in turn",
    ", `` useful entanglement '' in a distant laboratories paradigm may be identified with the concept of _ distillable entanglement _",
    "@xcite : a quantum state @xmath2 is called distillable if a supply of states which are independent and identically - distributed  in other words @xmath4  can be transformed into fewer almost perfect maximally entangled states , again using only local quantum operations and classical communication",
    ". such maximally entangled states of qubit pairs give immediately rise to a secret bit of key in quantum key distribution , or may form the resource in quantum state teleportation .",
    "a key assumption in such a distillation process is that the source produces identical uncorrelated specimens .",
    "an interesting generalization of this paradigm is the one in which the several copies of the state @xmath2 are not completely independent @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile both from a fundamental and practical point of view to study the effects of correlations among the copies of @xmath2 on its distillability properties . for each natural number @xmath5 , instead of considering the usual @xmath5 uncorrelated copies of the state in question , @xmath4",
    ", we consider that arbitrary correlations exist among those .",
    "hence , the full state is characterized by a density matrix @xmath6 with the requirement that @xmath7 for every @xmath8 , where @xmath9 stands for the partial trace of all the copies except the @xmath1-th .",
    "clearly there are several distinct choices for @xmath6 , representing the different ways in which the @xmath5 copies might be correlated .",
    "an interesting question in this respect is to classify the set of states for which correlations among its copies can rule out the possibility of obtaining useful entanglement by means of entanglement distillation .",
    "it is natural to expect that such correlations could have quite a drastic effect and , hence , that the set of _ copy - correlated undistillable states _ would be much larger than the usual set of undistillable states .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it turns out that the existence of correlations do not influence to a very large extend whether distillation can be successfully implemented or not .",
    "in fact , the state @xmath6 does not even have to be assumed to the permutation - symmetric : whether the correlated input is distillable or not merely depends on the reduction @xmath2 , and not on the correlations .",
    "we prove that the set of copy - correlated undistillable states is given by the convex hull of the set of undistillable states , therefore providing a new characterization for the latter .    at the core of this result",
    "is , of course , the characterization of the set of undistillable states .",
    "one of the key results in entanglement theory is that not every entangled state is distillable , demonstrating that there is a kind of _ bound entanglement _ in nature @xcite . in turn",
    ", a certain very simple criterion was found to be intimately related to distillability : that of the positivity of the partial transposition , obtained by transposition in only one part of a composite bi - partite system @xcite .",
    "a state that has a positive partial transposition is never distillable .",
    "what remained a quite notorious question is whether so - called nppt bound entangled states exist , so states which are not distillable but nevertheless exhibit a non - positive partial transpose .",
    "its existence has various ramifications in quantum information science @xcite  and would rule out the appealing feature of being able to test for undistillability by means of such a simple test as by computing the spectrum of the partial transpose .",
    "one direct implication of our result is that if every undistillable state is ppt , then arbitrary correlations among the copies of the state in question have no effect at all in whether distillation can be successfully implemented .",
    "we however find that the characterization of the set of copy - correlated undistillable states we establish actually gives strong indications on the existence of nppt bound entangled states .",
    "this is accomplished by proving a new entanglement activation result , which generalizes previous findings @xcite and points towards an activation process involving two undistillable states which would in particular imply the existence of nppt states .",
    "entanglement activation @xcite is the process in which an entangled state , which by itself would be useless for a given task e.g. teleportation , can be activated and used as an a resource when processed together with a second state . in the first example of such a phenomenon @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a certain ppt bound entangled state could be employed in order to increase the fidelity of teleportation of a second state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in turn , this result was shown to be a general feature of bound entangled states : any entangled state can increase the fidelity of teleportation of a second state . in this work",
    "we generalize such a result , proving that for every @xmath1 , the set of copy - correlated @xmath1-undistillable states , which are states for which correlations among @xmath1 copies of them can prevent the possibility of obtaining a two qubit entangled state by stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) , contains states capable of activating every entangled state .",
    "this new activation result we demonstrate then strongly suggests that a similar result might hold true by considering the set of copy - correlated undistillable states itself , which together with its identification with the convex - hull of the set of undistillable states , would be sufficient to prove the existence of nppt states .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we define the main quantities which we will be concerned with . in section 3 , in turn , we state our main results , which are proved subsequently in sections 4 , 5 , and 6 . in section 7",
    "we discuss the connections of our results with the conjecture about the existence of nppt bound entangled states",
    ". finally , we present the summary of this work together with some further conclusions in section 8 .",
    "we start by defining the objects we will be using frequently .",
    "@xmath10 will denote the hilbert space of a bi - partite @xmath11-dimensional quantum system .",
    "the state space over @xmath12 is written as @xmath13 .",
    "of central interest will be states @xmath2 on @xmath14 for some @xmath1 that are _ permutation - symmetric _ : this means that when permuting any of the @xmath1 bi - partite quantum states , the state is left unchanged under the standard representation of the symmetric group @xmath15 over @xmath14 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the representation in @xmath14 of an arbitrary element @xmath18 of @xmath15 .",
    "we define the symmetrization operation as @xmath19 the set of permutation - symmetric states will be denoted as @xmath20 .",
    "we will also freely make use of partial traces over part of systems : @xmath21 , for example , will refer to the partial trace over all but the first @xmath11-dimensional bi - partite quantum system .",
    "note that an early example of entanglement distillation of permutation - symmetric states has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", permutation symmetry was even considered when permuting each of the @xmath1 subsystems individually , @xmath22 which induces an even higher degree of symmetry than randomly permuting the @xmath1 bi - partite systems , but is included in the above case .    the distillability problem can be cast in terms of a notion that renders it more accessible using the techniques presented later in this work : it is related to the so - called _ slocc singlet fraction _ , @xmath23 }      { { \\text{tr}}[(a \\otimes b)^{\\cal y}\\rho ( a \\otimes b ) ] } , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 act on local parts of a bi - partite system with hilbert space @xmath12 and @xmath26 is the projector onto the two qubit maximally entangled state . in this language ,",
    "a state @xmath2 is distillable if and only if @xmath27 for some @xmath28 . in turn",
    ", a state @xmath2 is called @xmath5-undistillable if @xmath29 .",
    "finally , the set of undistillable states is composed of all the states that are @xmath5-undistillable for all @xmath30 .",
    "we denote the set of @xmath5-undistillable states by @xmath31 and the set of undistillable states by @xmath32 .",
    "the central object of this work is the generalization of such sets to the case where correlations among the several copies of the state might be present .",
    "we are interested in the worst case scenario and say that a state @xmath2 is copy - correlated @xmath1-undistillable if there is a @xmath33-undistillable state @xmath34 such that @xmath35 for every @xmath36 . in other words , if we can add correlations to the @xmath1 copy state @xmath37 , forming the state @xmath38 , such that no two qubit entanglement can be extracted from @xmath38 , we say that @xmath2 is copy - correlated @xmath1-copy undistillabe .",
    "it is clear that if such an extension exists , then @xmath39 is also a valid extension .",
    "it hence follows that w.l.o.g .",
    "we can define the set of copy - correlated @xmath1-undistillable states as    we say that a bi - partite state @xmath40 is copy - correlated @xmath1-undistillable if it has a permutation - symmetric extension @xmath34 which is single - copy undistillable .",
    "we denote the set of all such states by @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42    in the same way as one defines undistillability as @xmath1-undistillability for all @xmath1 , one can introduce an analogous definition in the copy - correlated case in more physical terms , the setting of copy - correlated distillation is the following : one considers sequences of sources , each producing permutation - symmetric correlated bipartite states entailing @xmath1 pairs each .",
    "this is the natural setting when the source produces entangled pairs at once , but the physical process achieving this leads to not entirely uncorrelated specimens .",
    "still , for the reductions to be identical and equal to some @xmath2 is still a reasonable assumption ( and the state can also be twirled over the symmetric group to make the reductions identical ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this concept of formation and distillation beyond i.i.d .",
    "sources has also been discussed in the pure - state case .",
    "note also that the correlations between the copies can be arbitrarily strong ( except that due to monogamy constraints , the resulting state will eventually become copy - correlated undistillable ) .",
    "we do not impose any restrictions to the kind of correlations allowed .",
    "if there are no correlations , the usual concept of distillation is recovered .",
    "the parties doing the distillation based on such a source will for a finite @xmath1 clearly not be able to do a quantum state tomography to find out @xmath2 : they will simply be promised the source to have that property .",
    "this is the natural setting of discussing entanglement distillation in the presence of cross - copy correlations and memory effects .",
    "note that we will not be interested in distillation rates in this work , but just in distillability as such .",
    "this naturally links to the concept of undistillability :    a state @xmath40 is said to be copy - correlated undistillable if it is copy - correlated @xmath1-undistillable for every @xmath43 .",
    "we denote the set of copy - correlated undistillable states by @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45    in words , a state @xmath2 belongs to @xmath44 if for every number of copies of the state one can add correlations among them so that no useful entanglement can be establish at all .",
    "this approach seems interesting for two reasons : one the one hand , this is a natural setting to consider , as the assumption of having entirely uncorrelated specimen at hand in entanglement distillation may be an unacceptably restrictive one . on the other hand ,",
    "as we will see , we can use this concept as a novel mathematical tool to grasp the structure of the set of undistillable states .",

    "since the latter set is possibly non - convex ( a property related to the existence of nppt bound entanglement @xcite ) , the convex hull of this set might , however , indeed be different of the set itself .",

    "the dual cone of the set of undistillable states can be characterized as follows @xmath49    in other words , we have fully characterized the dual cone of the set of undistillable states in terms of sets which are easily specified .    in the above framework , a standard maximally entangled state of dimension @xmath50",
    "is taken , as the _ singlet fraction _ is taken as the figure of merit .",
    "note that we aim for the question of obtaining such a singlet in a distillation protocol , but do not study rates of distillation here .",
    "we emphasize , however , that once @xmath51 , one can distill an arbitrary good approximation of a maximally entangled output of arbitrary dimension .",
    "this is the content of the next corollary .",
    "let @xmath52 be a state for which @xmath51 .",

    "again , the interesting aspect of this result is that it is a statement on asymptotic entanglement manipulation .",
    "but the whole asymptotic aspect is hidden in the characterization of the set of copy - correlated undistillable states : as an activation result , it refers to an operation on a single specimen alone .    for every entangled state @xmath40 and every @xmath57",

    "this holds true for any @xmath1 .",
