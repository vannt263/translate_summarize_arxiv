    "as should be expected , the comparison of the asymptotic expressions with the numerical results does not show as good agreement in the anelastic case as in the boussinesq case studied by @xcite . on the other hand , the conceptional value of the approximate asymptotic theory increases in proportion to the complexities introduced by anelastic density stratifications .    in the present paper",
    "only the linear local problem of the onset of convection has been investigated .",
    "an extension could be considered in connection with the spiralling nature of convection which depends on the second derivative of the density variation in the @xmath9direction .",
    "but since an analytical theory for this effect is not yet available even in the boussinesq case of the cylindrical annulus with varying inclination of the conical end surfaces , such an analysis will be deferred to future research .",
    "the spiralling of the convection columns is an important feature since it is associated with reynolds stresses that generate a differential rotation .",
    "such a mechanism could eventually be described by an analytical theory based on an expansion in powers of the amplitude of motion as has been done by @xcite in the case of the boussinesq version of the problem .",
    "finally the two - dimensional approximate analysis of the linear problem of anelastic convection could be improved through a three - dimensional multiscale analysis as has recently been done by @xcite in the limit of the boussinesq approximation .",

    "<S> the @xmath1 value of the position of the maximum of the amplitude of convection as shown in figures 2 and 4 of @xcite has been used in calculating the various parameters of the asymptotic theory . in comparing the critical wavenumbers </S>",
    "<S> a difficulty arises in that the asymptotic theory assumes that the convection columns are aligned in the radial direction , such that their wave - vector is directed in the azimuthal direction . in the numerical analysis of @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the convection columns are spiralling outwards such that the wave - vector acquires a radial component . </S>",

    "<S> the critical values of the rayleigh numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( as used in the formulation of @xcite ) do not depend strongly on the wavenumber and they exhibit a fairly close agreement between asymptotic and numerical values . the discrepancy in the frequencies @xmath6 as given by the asymptotic expression @xmath7 still persists . </S>",
    "<S> this is caused to some extent by the strong dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy may be reduced by taking into account the effect of convexly - curved rather than straight conical sloping endwalls of the annulus . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is considered in @xcite where it is shown that a perturbation of opposite sign to that of @xmath6 results due to the curvature . </S>",
    "<S> although this correction would reduce the discrepancy we have not calculated it since it can not be expressed in a simple analytical form . </S>"
