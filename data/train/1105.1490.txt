    "quantum correlated signal and idler photon pairs from parametric processes have been a crucial resource for quantum metrology and quantum information processing . to successfully fulfill a specific task",
    ", one needs to consider the spectral ( temporal ) properties .",
    "particularly , for the tasks involving quantum interference among independent sources , such as quantum teleportation and linear optical quantum computing  @xcite , photon pairs in a spectral factorable state are highly desirable  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "individual signal or idler beam ( photons ) in single mode thermal state is said to have high temporal coherence , which is the key to form quantum interference with high visibility  @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , the coherence degree of individual beam , determined by the correlation property of photon pairs , is related to its spatial and temporal modes . because it has been proved that the individual beam exhibits thermal fluctuation  @xcite , and there is a relation between the measured bunching coefficient and the mode number of a thermal field  @xcite , we characterize the degree of coherence by measuring the intensity correlation function @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "moreover , photon pairs generated from spontaneous parametric emissions ( spe ) , including spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) and spontaneous four wave mixing ( sfwm ) in @xmath1 and @xmath2 nonlinear media , respectively , usually exhibit significant spectral and spatial correlations . considering the spatial correlations",
    "can be minimized by using guided - wave configurations , here we focus on the spectral correlation determined temporal coherence property .",
    "when @xmath0 of individual signal or idler field is measured by using single photon detectors ( spds ) with response time much longer than the coherence time of the thermal field , @xmath0 increases with the decrease of the mode number contained in the field .",
    "for instance , for photon pairs in spectral factorable state , the measured photon statistics of the single mode individual beam is @xmath3 ( bose - einstein distribution ) , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the average photon number and probability of detecting n - photon , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for the photon pairs with perfect spectral correlation , individual beam is in multi - mode thermal state , and the measured photon statistics can be expressed as @xmath6 ( possion distribution ) . in the former case ,",
    "the value of @xmath0 equals 2 ; while in the latter , in the sense of realizing quantum interference among multiple sources , the temporal coherence degree is low , and the value of @xmath0 approaches 1  @xcite .    to obtain individual beam with high temporal coherence , pulsed laser",
    "are often chosen to serve as the pump source , because photon pairs from a continuous wave laser pumped spe always have perfect spectral correlation . for the pulse pumped spe ,",
    "generating spectral factorable two - photon state by using narrow band optical filters and by engineering the dispersion property of nonlinear media has been extensively studied  @xcite . in this process",
    ", the pulsed optical fields , including the mode - locked pump pulse train and individual signal or idler fields , will acquire certain amount of chirp during propagation in a transparent medium due to the effect of chromatic dispersion and kerr nonlinearity , particularly for the ultrashort femto - second pulses .",
    "however , for the related work presented so far , the pump is treated as a transform limited pulse , the influence of the chirp of pulsed pump has not been investigated .",
    "additionally , the impact of the chirp of pulsed individual signal or idler beam on the temporal coherence property has yet to be studied as well  @xcite .    in this paper , to the best of our knowledge , we study the effect of chromatic dispersion induced chirp on the temporal coherence property of individual beam generated from a spe process for the first time . based on sfwm in dispersion shifted fiber ( dsf ) , two series of experiments are investigated by introducing different amount of chirp into either the pulsed pump or individual signal ( idler ) beam . in the first one , @xmath0 of the filtered individual signal beam is measured as a function of the chirp of pump .",
    "the results demonstrate that the chirp of pump pulses decreases the degree of temporal coherence . in the second one ,",
    "a hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) type two - photon interference experiment with the signal beams generated in two different fibers are analyzed and conducted .",
    "the results illustrate that the chirp of individual beam does not change the temporal coherence degree , but affect the mode matching . to achieve high visibility , in addition to improving the coherence degree by minimizing the chirp of pump",
    ", mode matching should be optimized by properly managing the chirps of individual beams .",
    "our investigations are useful for quantum state engineering and quantum information processing .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce basic principle of the experiment . in sec .",
    "iii , using pulse pumped sfwm in 300 m dsf , we study the temporal coherence property by measuring @xmath0 of filtered individual signal ( idler ) beam as the chirp of pump is varied . when the chirp of pump pulses is taken into account , we find that the two - photon joint spectral intensity ( jsi ) function @xmath7 is not suitable for precisely characterizing the factorability of photon pairs , because the information of chirp contained in joint spectral amplitude ( jsa ) function @xmath8 vanishes in jsi . however , the measured @xmath0 of individual beam , depending on jsa and the spectrum of individual beam shaped by a filter , is a real reflection of the factorability of detected photon pairs . to obtain high temporal coherence , the chirp of pump should be minimized . in sec .",
    "iv , using signal beams respectively generated from two 300 m dsfs , we investigate a hom type two - photon interference experiment by varying the chirps of individual beams to better understand the influence of the chirp on quantum interference among multiple sources .",
    "the results show that the observed interference dip is not only related to the temporal coherence degree , but also dependent on temporal mode matching determined by the chirps of individual beams .",
    "when the chirps of individual beams are not properly managed , the visibility is decreased , while the measured width of interference dip is increased . in sec .",
    "v , we extend our investigation to a general pulse pumped spontaneous parametric process , and discuss the relation between @xmath0 and chirp . finally , we give a brief conclusion .",
    "to obtain individual beam of photon pairs with high temporal coherence , the following two methods are often used . for photon pairs with high spectral correlation ,",
    "one need to apply a filter with narrow bandwidth to signal or idler beam so that the detected photon pairs are spectrally factorable  @xcite . in this case , the filtered individual beam is in single temporal mode . while for the photon pairs , which are directly in a spectral factorable state  @xcite , individual signal or idler beam is in single mode , even without filtering .    in our experiment , photon pairs via sfwm",
    "are generated in dsf by a pulsed pump .",
    "the phase matching bandwidth of sfwm is very broad , signal and idler photon pairs with a relatively small detuning exhibit a strong spectral correlation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to obtain individual beam with high coherence , a filter with narrow bandwidth should be applied in signal or idler field  @xcite .    in order to study the influence of the chirp",
    ", we introduce the linear chirp by propagating the pulsed pump or individual signal ( idler ) beam through a piece of standard single mode fiber ( smf ) . for a given gaussian shaped spectrum ,",
    "the unchirped pulse can be expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 associated with the spectral width @xmath11 of optical field corresponds to the minimum pulse duration .",
    "if the kerr nonlinearity is insignificant , after propagating through the smf , the field evolves into @xmath12}$ ] , where @xmath13 is the group velocity of optical field in smf , @xmath14 is the chirp parameter , @xmath15 denotes second order dispersion coefficient , and @xmath16 is the length of the smf  @xcite . as a consequence , the pulse duration of the linearly chirped optical field , @xmath17 , is enlarged .",
    "our experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "the signal and idler photon pairs are produced by sfwm in dsf , and the pump source is a mode - locked pulse train with a certain amount of linear chirp . in sfwm process , two pump photons at frequency @xmath18 scatter through the kerr ( @xmath2 ) nonlinearity of the fiber to create energy - time entangled signal and idler photons at frequencies @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , such that @xmath21 . to reliably detect the signal and idler photons",
    ", one must effectively suppress the pump photons from reaching the detector , so the output of dsf propagates through a dual band filter f2 , which is realized by cascading wavelength - division multiplexing ( wdm ) filters with one channel of array waveguide gratings ( awg ) .",
    "the pump - rejection ratio provided by f2 is in excess of 120 db .",
    "the phase mismatch term of the sfwm is  @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the peak pump power , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the nonlinear coefficient and third order dispersion coefficient of the fiber , respectively , @xmath26 is the central frequency difference between signal and idler fields , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are related to @xmath29 and @xmath30 by @xmath31 and @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath25 are respectively associated with the dispersion slope of dsf through @xmath33 and @xmath34 . when the central wavelength of pump @xmath35 is longer than the zero dispersion wavelength @xmath36 of dsf , we get @xmath37 which , in addition to a small amount of self - phase modulation and third order dispersion results in the satisfaction of @xmath38 .    in the experiment , 300 m dsf with @xmath39 nm and @xmath40 ps/(nm@xmath41 km )",
    "is submerged in liquid nitrogen to suppress raman scattering  @xcite .",
    "the central wavelength and repetition rate of the mode - locked pump laser are about 1538.9 nm and 41 mhz , respectively .",
    "the fiber polarization controller ( fpc1 ) and a polarization beam splitter ( pbs1 ) are used to ensure the polarization and power adjustment of pump .",
    "signal and idler photons co - polarized with the pump are selected by adjusting fpc2 placed in front of pbs2 .",
    "the central wavelength of f2 in signal and idler bands are 1546.9 nm and 1530.9 nm , respectively . under this condition",
    ", @xmath38 is satisfied , and an efficient sfwm with broad band phase matching is realized . to obtain signal or idler photons with high temporal coherence ,",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the narrow band filter f2 is set to be 0.4 nm in both signal and idler bands .",
    "to achieve the pulsed pump with different amount of linear chirp , we first obtain the initial pump pulses by passing the output of a mode - locked femto - second fiber laser through filter f1 , whose central wavelength and fwhm are 1538.9 and 1 nm , respectively .",
    "next , we introduce chirp by propagating the initial pump along a piece of standard smf with @xmath15 of about @xmath42 ps@xmath43/km . before launching into the smf",
    ", the initial pump is attenuated to about 10 @xmath44w to ensure the chirp is mainly originated from the chromatic dispersion , but not kerr nonlinearity .",
    "the quantity of the imported linear chirp can be changed by varying the length of smf . to obtain the required power ,",
    "the pump pulses are then amplified by an erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) , and cleaned up by passing through another f1 . for the smf with length of 400 m , 600 m , 800 m , 1 km , 1.2 km , and 1.4 km , respectively",
    ", we measure the pulse duration of the chirped pulses passed through edfa and f1 by using an auto - correlator . according to the relation between the pulse duration and chirp , @xmath45 , with @xmath46 denoting the fwhm of pump ,",
    "the amount of chirp of pump field @xmath47 can be deduced .",
    "figure 2(a ) plots @xmath48 as a function of the length of smfs .",
    "note that the pulsed pump is not transform limited even if the smf is by passed , because quantity of chirp @xmath47 presented in the initial pump is greater than @xmath49 .",
    "the signal ( idler ) photons propagated through f2 are then counted by spds ( id200 ) operated in the gated geiger mode .",
    "the @xmath50ns gate pulses arrive at a rate of about @xmath51mhz , which is @xmath52 of the repetition rate of the pump pulses , and the dead time of the gate is set to be 10 @xmath44s .",
    "the timing of gate pulses are adjusted by a digital delay generator to coincide with the arrival of signal ( idler ) photons . to measure the intensity correlation function @xmath0 ,",
    "photons in signal ( idler ) band propagate through a 50 - 50 beam splitter ( bs ) and then are detected by spd1 and spd2 , respectively . in the measurement ,",
    "path matching is required to ensure the photons detected by two spds are produced by the same pump pulse . because the coherence property of filtered individual signal and idler photons is identical in our experiment , in the following description , we only present the results of signal photons , and refer to the signal photons as signal beam .    before presenting experimental data ,",
    "let s briefly analyze the the dependence of measured @xmath0 of signal beam by taking the chirps of pulsed pump and individual beams into account .",
    "the strong pump pulses with a linear chirp @xmath47 and gaussian shaped spectrum remain classical , and can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 denotes the bandwidth of pump . in the heisenberg picture , and in the low gain regime ,",
