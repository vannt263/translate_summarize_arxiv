    "recent discoveries of exoplanets with earth - like mass and radius @xcite have intensified debate on how such planets compare to earth in other respects . due to observational bias , many of the discovered exoplanets inhabit short - period , close - in orbits and have effective temperatures exceeding many hundreds of kelvin . for such planets ,",
    "a likely outcome of dynamical evolution is tidal locking to their parent stars and , most probably , capture into a 1:1 spin - orbit resonance @xcite .",
    "synchronous rotation causes asymmetric insolation and , in the absence of a substantial atmosphere , a strong ( 100 s to 1000 s k ) temperature contrast between these planets permanent day and night sides , as has been estimated for corot-7b @xcite and is plausible for kepler-10b @xcite .",
    "characterization of exoplanet surfaces is challenging and numerical simulations can help determine possible scenarios .",
    "subsolidus convection is likely within the silicate mantles of rocky exoplanets but its vigor and surface expression depend on mantle temperature , composition , and rheology . within the solar system ,",
    "earth is the only planet that currently exhibits plate tectonics which , on a geologic time scale , regulates volatile species in earth s atmosphere via volcanic outgassing , silicate weathering , and subduction of precipitated carbon @xcite .",
    "venus is thought to experience infrequent global - scale resurfacing events , possibly the result of mantle - wide episodic overturn and associated with the formation of a dense greenhouse atmosphere , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "mars has experienced recent substantial volcanism although there is no evidence for recent crustal mobility , suggesting a stagnant lid regime with convective activity in the mantle interior below a static single - plate lithosphere , e.g. @xcite .",
    "elevated surface temperatures can affect a planet s interior dynamics @xcite and its surface properties , as exemplified by insolation - driven variations of mercury s lithospheric strength @xcite .",
    "although there are no examples in our solar system , a hemispheric contrast in surface temperature may influence the interior dynamics and surface expression of exoplanets .    here , we investigate the effect of elevated surface temperature and strong surface temperature contrasts for earth - mass planets on ( i ) patterns of mantle convection , ( ii ) tectonic regimes , and ( iii ) the rate and distribution of partial melting ( volcanism ) . for this purpose",
    ", we conducted numerical simulations of mantle convection with imposed surface temperatures .",
    "we investigated planetary mantle convection through numerical simulations of an incompressible fluid at infinite prandtl number using the classical boussinesq formulation .",
    "the associated conservation equations for mass , momentum , and energy are solved numerically using the finite element package citcoms-3.1.1 @xcite .",
    "we investigated effective rayleigh numbers @xmath1 in the range @xmath210@xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the respective reference values for density , gravitational acceleration , thermal expansivity , and thermal diffusivity , @xmath8 is the time - averaged mantle viscosity , @xmath9 is the temperature contrast across the mantle , and @xmath10 is the mantle thickness .",
    "bottom and internal heating both contribute to the heat budget .",
    "internal radiogenic heat production is uniformly distributed across the mantle domain and constant in time in our models .",
    "the non - dimensional internal heat generation rate , defined as @xmath11 @xcite , is set to 11 ; this corresponds to a dimensional heating rate of @xmath12 w kg@xmath13 , close to the present - day chondritic heating rate @xcite .",
    "our calculations ignore dissipation of tidal forces that can contribute to mantle heating and thermal runaway , depending on orbital eccentricity and type of resonance @xcite . however , without external perturbations , tidal dissipation renders orbital eccentricity insignificant on myr  gyr time scales and tidal effects can be neglected .    for the mantle domain , we employ an annulus ( bi - section of a 3-d spherical domain ) that is aligned with the ecliptic plane .",
    "all domain boundaries are free - slip and two side boundaries are imposed at the antistellar point . we adopt earth s outer radius ( @xmath14 = 6371 km ) and mantle thickness ( @xmath10 = 2891 km ) , and allocate 257 x 65 nodal points in the lateral and radial directions , respectively , with gradual mesh refinement towards the top and bottom boundaries where temperature variations are generally greatest .    to permit plate - like behavior of the surface boundary layer , we adopt a composite viscous / pseudo - plastic rheology in our models , following @xcite .",
    "temperature - dependent viscosity @xmath15 is described by an arrhenius - type law :    @xmath16,\\ ] ]    where the reference viscosity is @xmath17 pa s , and @xmath18 is the dimensionless mantle potential temperature that relates to the dimensional temperature , @xmath19 , as @xmath20 , with @xmath9 = 2400 k the potential temperature contrast across the mantle and @xmath21 the surface potential temperature .",
    "viscosity changes by 5 orders of magnitude over the considered temperature range ( @xmath22 $ ] ) and generates a lithosphere over a weaker mantle .",
    "pseudo - plastic yielding concentrates strain and allows for lithospheric break - up in confined regions that mimic subduction zones and spreading centers @xcite . in regions where the model stress exceeds an assigned yield stress , @xmath23 , a yield viscosity",
    "is calculated as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the second invariant of the strain rate tensor .",
    "the composite rheology is described as @xmath26 .",
    "we did not consider strain- or strain - rate - weakening @xcite , or time - dependent damage rheology @xcite , which could further enhance plate - like behavior but would significantly complicate our analysis .",
    "we assign distinct temperature conditions for 3 contrasting cases . in a first set ( `` cold '' or c - models )",
    "we apply a uniform , time - constant surface temperature @xmath21 = 273 k , comparable to earth . a second set ( `` hot '' or h - models ) mimics close - in planets ( i.e. , orbital distance of @xmath27 = 0.13 au around a solar mass star ) with efficient heat redistribution and a uniform surface temperature of @xmath21 = 759 k. a third set ( `` asymmetric '' or a - models ) considers planets on a similar close - in orbit that lack heat redistribution . for these models ,",
    "a high substellar temperature of @xmath28 = 1073 k decreases sinusoidally to the terminus and is kept constant on the night side at @xmath21 = 273 k. for all models , the core - mantle boundary ( cmb ) potential temperature is uniform and constant at @xmath29 = 2673 k. each simulation is run for several billion years ( gyr ) of model time and we exclude the first 1 gyr of initial transients to focus on statistically steady - state behavior .",
    "to quantify tectonic regimes , we make use of two previously - defined diagnostics @xcite .",
    "first , to quantify the localization of surface strain rates , we define `` plateness '' as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the area fraction that encompasses 80% of the total surface strain rate .",
    "@xmath32 corresponds to strain localization for isoviscous convection .",
    "second , lid mobility @xmath33 is defined as the ratio of the root - mean - square ( rms ) surface flow velocity relative to the rms velocity of the entire mantle domain , @xmath34 .",
    "models with plate - like behavior are characterized by @xmath35 and for stagnant lid convection @xmath36 . to allow faster calculations , we made use of the symmetry of the problem and determined tectonic regimes ( section [ sct - res1 ] ) for models of 180@xmath37 opening angle , with side boundaries at the sub - stellar and anti - stellar points .",
    "for 4 representative models the time - averaged @xmath38 and @xmath33 values differ by only @xmath39% and @xmath40% , respectively , when comparing models of 180@xmath37 and 360@xmath37 .",
    "pressure - release partial melting is calculated following @xcite .",
    "we only consider melting in regions where convective flow is upward and where real ( potential + adiabatic ) temperatures exceed the mantle solidus temperature ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "for @xmath42 we use a parameterization for dry mantle peridotite with a 1 bar value of @xmath43 k and @xmath44 k km@xmath13 , in rough agreement with experimental measurements ( e.g. , hirschmann 2000 ) . in melting regions , the local melting rate , @xmath45 ,",
    "is calculated as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the degree of melting and @xmath48 is the upward convective flow velocity .",
    "we use a constant value @xmath49 km@xmath13 for the adiabatic melt production per kilometer of upwelling @xcite .",
    "the local melting rate , @xmath45 , is subsequently integrated over each melt column to give the surficial melt distribution .",
    "we limit melt production to a maximum depth of 50 km , which results in a time - averaged melt production for a nominal earth model ( c150 ) consistent with earth s present - day melt production of @xmath50 km@xmath51yr@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "our choice of maximum depth affects the total melt production but has a small influence on the comparison between models or on surficial distributions of melt . because side boundaries promote vertical flow and unphysical concentration of melt at the substellar point , we calculate melting from models with a 360@xmath37 opening angle .",
    "c - models show a variety of convection regimes for a progressive increase of the yield stress values @xmath23 . at @xmath52 mpa ,",
    "continuous yielding prevents the formation of stiff surface plates .",

    "surface plates exhibit approximately piecewise constant velocities ( figure [ fig - convect]a , green curve ) and converge toward subduction - like downwellings while diverging at localized spreading centers ( figure [ fig - convect]d ) .",
    "a further increase of the yield stress produces a more time - dependent solution with alternating periods of surface mobility and stagnation . for sufficiently high yield stress ( 800 mpa ) ,",
    "surface mobility diminishes and stagnant lid convection persists ( figure [ fig - convect]a , blue curve ) . to further demonstrate tectonic regimes , we show plateness @xmath38 and mobility @xmath33 in figure [ fig - domainplot ] . for the c - models ( figure [ fig - domainplot]a ) ,",
    "plateness increases to @xmath54 with increasing yield stress at high mobility ( @xmath55 ) until the lid mobility rapidly decreases ( @xmath36 ) around @xmath56 mpa ( and plateness becomes irrelevant ) .    for the h - models , coherent lithospheric plates do not develop because low viscosities near the warm ( @xmath21 = 759 k ) surface promote viscous deformation and suppress pseudo - plastic yielding , consistent with the predictions of @xcite .",

    "melting is more vigorous for model h150 because diffuse surface deformation occurs globally , and is less vigorous for model a150 because deformation occurs diffusely only near the substellar point .",
    "many recently - discovered exoplanets inhabit close - in orbits and this results in high ( 100 s to 1000 s k ) effective temperatures ( figure [ fig - eptemps ] ) . planets",
    "closer than 0.5 au are likely tidally locked ( figure [ fig - eptemps ] , black dotted line ) @xcite and synchronously rotating around their parent stars . at distances of @xmath630.1 au ,",
    "earth - mass planets are unlikely to retain an atmosphere , due to atmospheric loss either by extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) heating @xcite or stellar wind erosion @xcite ( figure [ fig - eptemps ] , purple dashed curves ) .",
    "these boundaries move outward for smaller planets that orbit around larger stars .",
    "absence of a substantial atmosphere results in high substellar temperatures , approximated as @xmath69 , and the night side remains cold .",
    "thus , hot a - model behavior is expected for close - in orbits , and our results demonstrate that a persistent hemispheric surface temperature contrast @xmath0400 k can maintain a degree 1 pattern of mantle convection in which the planetary surface moves preferentially toward subduction zones on the cold night side .",
    "these planets should exhibit an inhospitable day side with vigorous volcanism and a cold night side that allows for more earth - like tectonics and plate - like behavior .",
    "melt production increases with increasing surface temperature contrast , and at 0.13 au the calculated total melting rate is @xmath25 times higher than for a cool planet at 1 au where plate tectonic behavior occurs globally ( c - models ) .    at intermediate distances ( @xmath20.1 au ) , an atmosphere is more likely to persist and atmospheric redistribution of heat is expected to produce a uniform hot surface . for such planets , our h - model results demonstrate that mobility of the lithosphere prevents the formation of coherent plates and the emergence of earth - like plate tectonics .",
    "compared to an asymmetric model at the same orbital distance , melt production is enhanced by a factor @xmath702 , and occurs globally across a surface that is characterized by diffuse deformation .",
    "our results suggest the possbility of different feedback mechanisms.volcanic outgassing is responsible for the formation of secondary planetary atmospheres .",
    "therefore , asymmetric conditions can only be sustained if the atmosphere is continuously eroded .",
    "if , instead , an atmosphere is retained , heat redistribution promotes mobile lid convection with diffuse deformation and further increases global volcanic outgassing .",
    "this suggests a positive feedback in favor of a thick atmosphere , unless another mechanism modifies the atmospheric balance .",
    "for example , no melt production is calculated for one - plate model planets , a possibility for potential close - in equivalents of present - day venus .",
    "atmospheres would be unprotected against solar wind erosion if a magnetodynamo is deactivated due to a transformation from plate tectonics to a regime that is less efficient at cooling the mantle and core @xcite .",
    "substantial atmospheric loss would allow for a negative feedback and such planets could fluctuate between symmetric and asymmetric end- member scenarios or reach an intermediate equilibrium , depending on the timescale of atmospheric loss relative to mantle thermal evolution .",
    "the dependence of tectonic regimes on @xmath23 for our nominal earth models is consistent with previous studies performed using 2-d cartesian , 3-d cartesian , and 3-d spherical geometries @xcite . as in the above - mentioned studies plate - like behavior occurs at yield stresses lower than classical estimates for dry oceanic lithospheric strength by up to @xmath21000 mpa @xcite , but weak fault zone fabric may account for this discrepancy @xcite . the weak dependence of tectonic regimes on @xmath71 shown in figure [ fig - domainplot]a is in agreement with numerical results of @xcite and scaling laws of plate tectonic convection by @xcite .",
    "because a higher @xmath71 is expected for more massive planets , this low sensitivity to @xmath71 suggests that our results can be applied to planets of various sizes .",
    "convection in massive `` super - earth '' mantles may be influenced by their more extreme pressure and temperature conditions .",
    "for example , mineral physics calculations suggest a viscosity decrease of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude for the deep mantles of super - earths @xcite , in favor of vigorous convective overturn .",
    "high mantle pressure allows for mineral phase transformations that do not occur in earth s mantle @xcite but which can strongly influence the dynamics of super - earth mantles @xcite .",
    "although important questions remain , our simulations demonstrate the strong influence that surface temperature contrasts exert on mantle convection , surface tectonics , and volcanism for close - in rocky exoplanets .",
    "distinct scenarios are likely associated with variations in albedo , volcanism , and atmospheric content that may become astronomically detectable in the future .    1 batalha , n. m. et al .",
