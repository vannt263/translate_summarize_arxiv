    "soft @xmath0-ray repeaters ( sgrs ; for a recent observational review , see @xcite ) were initially discovered by their intense and repeated emission of soft ( @xmath4  kev ) @xmath0-rays .",
    "these bursts are significantly super - eddington ( @xmath5 ; @xcite ) , but are dwarfed by the giant flares . the flares are thousands of times more energetic than typical bursts and have harder spectra ( @xmath6  mev ) , but are rare , with only two observed in the past 20 years .",
    "sgrs also emit quiescently in x - rays .",
    "this emission exhibits a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath7 , and may also have small blackbody contributions with @xmath8  kev .",
    "sgrs pulsate both in quiescence and during bursts with periods ( 58  s ) that are longer than those typical for radio pulsars , and relatively large spin - down rates as well ( @xmath9 ; @xcite ) .    based on energetics and proximity to supernova remnants ( snrs ) or star - formation regions , sgrs",
    "are generally thought to be young ( @xmath10  yr ) neutron stars . given this , the most widely accepted model for sgrs has been the magnetar model @xcite .",
    "magnetars , neutron stars with @xmath11  g , are objects whose primary power source is magnetic field decay rather than spin - down ( radio pulsars ) or accretion ( x - ray binaries ) .",
    "the high magnetic fields were invoked to explain the very long super - eddington tail of the 5  march  1979 outburst @xcite and its spin period @xcite . in the magnetar model ,",
    "sgrs produce bursts and flares through violent recombination and unpinning of the magnetic field , driven by crust fractures @xcite .",
    "non - thermal quiescent emission is thought to be due to currents in their magnetospheres arising from the continuing competition between crust and magnetic stresses @xcite .",
    "the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ; see @xcite for a review ) are a group of objects that appear similar to the sgrs .",
    "however , they have softer spectra ( @xmath12 and more prominent blackbody components ) and have not been observed to burst .",
    "@xcite proposed that both classes had similar origins , based on similar spin properties and x - ray luminosities .",
    "while intriguing , magnetars are not the only possible models for axps .",
    "propeller driven spindown of accreted / ejected matter from a fallback disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) produced during the supernova explosion , a `` pushback '' disk ( enhanced fallback from an overly dense environment ; see @xcite ) , or a disk acquired by a high velocity neutron star that has caught up with its ejecta @xcite , was postulated to explain the emission and period clustering of the axps . with a standard @xmath13-g magnetic field , an accreting pulsar would naturally reach an equilibrium spin period of @xmath14  s , and the observed variations in spin - down ( @xcite ; @xcite ) could be explained by accretion torques .",
    "accretion would provide a large and easily accessible reservoir of energy for the axps .",
    "this is in contrast to magnetars , which can only emit @xmath15 ( for a @xmath16-g field ) over their lifetimes . given the attractiveness of the accretion model on energetics ground , it has also been proposed that sgrs are powered by the same mechanism @xcite . in the propeller spin - down model",
    ", the bursts are expected to result from starquakes produced ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by fractures and phase transitions in subducted crust piled up by the extreme plate tectonics @xcite driven by the very rapid spindown of the neutron star .",
    "the damping times of neutron star vibrational modes in such a quake model can possibly explain @xcite both the duration of the 5  march  1979 outburst and its very long super - eddington tail .",
    "the discovery of the soft power - law spectrum ( @xmath17 ) of one sgr , sgr  0526@xmath166 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k00 ) suggests axps and sgrs may be linked through spectral as well as spin properties , and that sgr  0526@xmath166  may be a transition object bridging the two classes .    with its high galactic latitude , sgr  0526@xmath166",
    "has a comparatively low extinction , allowing much deeper optical observations than those of the other sgrs , despite its greater distance .",
    "the other sgrs have extinctions of 1030 magnitudes in the optical band ( @xmath18 for sgr  1900@xmath1914 based on @xcite ; @xmath20  mag for sgr  1806@xmath120 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , this object provides an important test for models of the quiescent optical emission from sgrs .",
    "on 5  march  1979 , spacecraft recorded a giant @xmath0-ray flare @xcite that is currently second in brightness , behind only the 28  august  1998 flare of sgr  1900@xmath1914 @xcite .",
    "the burst showed a very short rise ( @xmath21  ms ) followed by a @xmath22-ms decay and a pulsating phase ( lasting @xmath23  min ; @xcite ) . while overall the spectrum is rather soft , the initial flare had a hard tail , perhaps associated with the initial outburst rather than its afterglow @xcite .",
    "there were also indications of a 430-kev emission line , probably the 511-kev annihilation line redshifted by gravity from the surface of a neutron star @xcite . @xcite and @xcite identified an 8-s periodicity in the burst data .",
    "triangulation located the source in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , specifically in the direction of snr ( n49 ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming the association to hold , the inferred isotropic luminosity of the source was calculated to be @xmath24 , with a total energy output of @xmath25 ( for x - rays @xmath26  kev ; @xcite ) .    on 6  march  1979 a second burst lasting @xmath27",
    "s was observed at the same position , with a similarly soft spectrum , although its intensity was a factor of 100 below that of 5  march  1979 .",
    "bursts of lower intensity were subsequently observed @xcite , although none after @xmath28 .",
    "the later bursts showed a clustering which was interpreted @xcite as a periastron passage in a highly eccentric 164 day orbit , which was later also indicated in the observation of and optical flash from sgr  0526@xmath166  @xcite .",
    "however , later analysis of the clustering of bursts from sgr  1900@xmath1914 which has also emitted a giant flare ) and sgr  1806@xmath120 has pointed towards a lognormal distribution of time intervals , similar to that of earthquakes @xcite .",
    "this distribution suggests that the bursts result from internal rather than external triggers .",
    "later , x - ray observations identified a point source , , coincident with the @xmath0-ray error box @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the quiescent source is @xmath29 ( 0.12.4  kev ; @xcite ; k00 ) , and while no periodicity was found in the rosat data , the limit on the pulsed fraction of 66% @xcite was not very stringent .",
    "recent _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( cxo ) observations of have shown that the source is indeed pointlike and has a drastically different spectrum ( nonthermal with photon index of @xmath30 ) than the rest of the supernova remnant , leaving little doubt that  is the quiescent counterpart of sgr  0526@xmath166  ( k00 ) .      to find the extinction @xmath31 , @xcite use a relation between the hydrogen column density @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ; k00 ) and the extinction .",
    "most of the intervening hydrogen and extinction are local to the lmc ( @xmath34 , as inferred from @xcite ) , so we therefore use the relation appropriate to the lmc : @xmath35 @xcite and find @xmath36  mag .",
    "we then use the standard galactic reddening curve ( which should also apply to the lmc longward of 200  nm ; @xcite ) from @xcite normalized to @xmath31 . from this",
    "we find the reddening @xmath37  mag , generally consistent with that found by @xcite from studies of line ratios in n49 ( although there is significant variation over the remnant , with @xmath38 ranging from 0.0  mag to 0.5  mag ) .",
    "we note that the values for the extinction are somewhat imprecise and may have significant variations on scales as small as @xmath39 @xcite , but this does not significantly affect our analysis .",
    "the extinction values that we used are listed in table  [ tab : sum ] , and are at the upper end of the range possible for sgr  0526@xmath166 .",
    "we parameterize the distance to the lmc / sgr  0526@xmath166  as @xmath40  kpc .",
    "the data consist of _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) wfpc2 observations with several filters of the field centered around the supernova remnant n49 in the lmc .",
    "see table [ tab : sum ] for a log of the observations .",
    "the hst wfpc2 filter designations describe the center wavelengths and widths .",
    "f300w , for example , is a wide bandwidth filter centered at 300  nm , while f547 m is a medium bandwidth filter centered at 547  nm .      the data from 14  november  1998 and 27  april  1999 were taken with hst in different orientations , so they were processed separately , although with the same procedure .",
    "we used the drizzling  pixels , and the nominal resolution is @xmath41 , indicating that it undersamples the point - spread function ( psf ) . by dithering to positions with fractional - pixel offsets , we are able to retrieve some of the lost information , eventually increasing the nominal resolution by a factor of @xmath42 , while preserving photometric integrity . ]",
    "procedure to reduce the images and remove cosmic rays @xcite , employing the standard methodology and parameter values .",
    "we combined the resulting images into a master @xmath43   pixel image , oversampling the planetary camera ( pc ) pixels by a factor of two ( changing the pixel scale from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ) .",
    "we also applied geometric distortion corrections appropriate for each wavelength , so that the relative astrometry between detectors or in a given detector should be accurate .",
    "typical stellar sources had a fwhm of @xmath46 , as expected from the telescope psf .",
    "we used the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite as our astrometric reference , fitting to the f547 m images ( which presented the best combination of signal to noise ratio and nebular rejection ) .",
    "while no usno - a2.0 stars were visible on the pc image , we had many on the wide field ( wf ) images . using twenty - four usno - a2.0 stars , we computed a solution for a mosaiced image of all the wfpc2 detectors assembled with the task wmosaic .",
    "the wmosaic task corrects for geometric distortions and relative offsets between the different detectors , so using the mosaiced image to solve for stars on an individual detector should not have introduced significant errors .",
    "the solution has @xmath47 rms residuals in each coordinate ( comparable to the accuracy of the usno - a2.0 positions ; @xcite ) .",
    "we then identified fourteen fainter stars on the pc portion of the mosaiced image , determined their positions from the mosaic plate solution , and found the solution for the drizzled images ( @xmath48 residuals for each coordinate ) , which we transferred to the other bands .",
    "the position for  [ determined by k00 to be @xmath49 , @xmath50 was located on the drizzled images , yielding the position in figure  [ fig : circle ] .",
    "the final intrinsic astrometric uncertainties are @xmath51 , and the cxo systematic uncertainties are @xmath52 ( based on other data , we believe @xmath52 to be a conservative estimate for cxo ; e.  schegel  2000 , private communication ) .",
    "this gives @xmath53 for the overall 1  @xmath54 uncertainty in each coordinate . from this",
    "we find the 90% confidence radius to be @xmath55 .",
    "the position of , as measured with cxo by k00 , is on the pc detector , so we are only concerned with these data .",
    "once we had drizzled images for each filter , we performed aperture photometry on each object on the pc using the sextractor photometry package @xcite . using the f547 m image as the reference",
    ", we measured the positions of @xmath56 stars on the pc .",
    "we then used this master list of sources to do photometry for all of the filters . because of the large amount of nebulosity in the images , it is difficult to determine the background level accurately .",
    "we computed a background by gridding the image into @xmath57 pixel bins ( @xmath58 ) , and then producing an average ( after rejecting high pixels ) for each one .",
    "we subtracted this smooth background , resulting in an image that does not contain most of the variations due to nebulosity .",
    "next , a fitted elliptical profile was analyzed for each source .",
    "the magnitude was determined by fitting this profile out to a radius of @xmath59 ( for stars ) and integrating .",
    "we then applied two types of aperture - corrected magnitude estimates with sextractor ( `` adaptive aperture '' and `` corrected isophotal '' magnitudes ) to compute the true magnitude .",
    "zero - point magnitudes in the stmag system , with @xmath60 in @xmath61 . ] were calculated according to the wfpc2 manual , where the calibration parameters photflam and photzpt are taken from the image headers .",
    "the values we calculated are listed in table  [ tab : sum ] . to convert the magnitudes to fluxes",
    ", we scale our count rates by the photflam parameter , which is the flux of a source that produces @xmath62 .",
    "to determine limiting magnitudes , we empirically determined the point - spread functions ( psfs ) of the different images for @xmath63 stars .",
    "we then used this psf to add 50 simulated stars to the central part of the images .",
    "these stars were distributed in magnitude such that some were above and some below the detection limit .",
    "we performed photometry on these simulated stars , and define the limiting ( 3@xmath54 ) magnitude to be where the measured magnitudes of the stars have errors @xmath64  mag , indicating that stars can no longer be accurately measured .",
    "these values have an intrinsic uncertainty of @xmath65  mag , and are reported in table  [ tab : sum ] .",
    "we note that these values represent completeness limits for the region around sgr  0526@xmath166   individual stars can still be detected with fainter magnitudes , but no source was missed to the limits presented here .",
    "our primary goal for these observations was to detect a counterpart to sgr  0526@xmath166  or a cooling synchrotron nebula left by previous bursts ( cf .",
    "the radio nebula from @xcite ) and confined by the hot gas in the interior of n49 .",
    "we therefore examined all of the sources within the @xmath55  error circle that were not obviously part of the snr .",
    "the images are shown in figure  [ fig : circle ] .",
    "we present photometric data concerning the sources in the error circle in table  [ tab : sources ] .",
    "we compared the colors of these sources to those of the @xmath66 other sources detectable on the pc image .",
    "all but one of the nine candidate sources lie in the color - magnitude diagram formed by the field sources , as seen in figure  [ fig : hr1 ] .",
    "seven ( possibly eight ) of the sources from table  [ tab : sources ] are generally consistent with main sequence g / k stars at the distance of the lmc , with reddening similar to that used here ( @xmath67 ) . of the two that are not ( f and possibly e ) , both have nebulosity leading to other parts of the snr .",
    "we now examine these sources in detail .",
    "for source e we find @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70",
    ". this may be consistent with a gv star ( given reddening uncertainties ) , but the source has some surrounding nebulosity trailing to the south and west , in the direction of other filaments .",
    "we therefore believe that this is part of the snr .",
    "for source f , we find @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , and a slightly extended morphology .",
    "this is not consistent with a main - sequence star .",
    "however , the source is extended towards the south thereby making the photometry suspect , and the source merges into the snr nebulosity . in the f814w image f",
    "appears almost to have a bow - shock morphology , but this morphology changes so much in the other images that we believe it to be coincidence .",
    "we therefore conclude that f , like e , is part of the snr .",
    "narrowband imaging of the field could easily settle this matter , as source f would primarily emit in emission lines if it is part of the snr .",
    "using the optical data from this paper and the x - ray data from k00 we can plot the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sgr  0526@xmath166 .",
    "we find that any optical detections or upper limits severely constrain the spectrum below 0.5  kev ( see figure  [ fig : nufnu ] ) .",
    "the optical data given here demonstrate that the spectrum can not continue to climb when going to lower frequencies , as it does in the x - rays ( @xmath74 from 6.0  kev down to 0.5  kev ; k00 ) .",
    "it must therefore peak between the near uv and the hard uv / soft x - ray bands .",
    "the location of the peak depends on the form of the spectrum below the peak .",
    "below we discuss several possibilities for the nature of sgr  0526@xmath166 , along with consequences for its optical emission .",
    "we modeled the emission from a fossil disk @xcite surrounding a neutron star based on the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our model accounts for both viscous dissipation @xcite and re - radiation of x - rays emitted by the central source @xcite , and solves for the disk structure in a self - consistent manner .",
    "this is similar to the models used by @xcite and @xcite , and is reasonably general .",
    "the major assumption is that the disks radiate like superpositions of many blackbodies .",
    "one might think that beaming could influence the results , but @xcite found that beaming from a relativistic central object did little to change the observed spectrum .",
    "the basic disk model ( bd ) , plotted in figures [ fig : nufnu ] , [ fig : hr2 ] , and [ fig : nufnu_stars ] , assumes @xmath75 ( 0.510  kev ; k00 ) , which agrees with the rosat determination ( calculated using w3pimms assuming @xmath17 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "the inner radius is the corrotation radius @xmath77  cm ( @xmath78 , @xmath79  s ) , and the outer radius is @xmath80  cm @xcite .",
    "we do not determine a value for the outer radius independently , but the results are insensitive to it as long as @xmath81  cm .",
    "we also consider an alternate model proposed by @xcite , where @xmath82 , which we designate hd@xmath83 ( hollow disk ) ; here @xmath84 is the magnetetospheric radius defined as @xmath85 the alvn radius @xmath86 , and @xmath87  g is the magnetic field . as",
    "figures  [ fig : hr2 ] and [ fig : nufnu_stars ] show , these models are very likely excluded for the sources in the error circle .",
    "the disk models are both significantly brighter ( @xmath88  mag ) than the stars and have the wrong colors .",
    "this result is not very sensitive to the value of the extinction , as our value is at the high end of reasonable values , and therefore the corrected stellar fluxes in figure  [ fig : nufnu_stars ] would only decrease upon changing @xmath31 .",
    "we therefore do not believe that any of the sources in table  [ tab : sources ] could be an accretion disk .",
    "thus the optical counterpart to sgr  0526@xmath166  must be fainter than the limits presented here .    in order to accommodate these optical limits for an accretion disk",
    ", we must modify either the inclination angle @xmath89 , the outer radius @xmath90 , or the inner radius @xmath91 .",
    "for the first two parameters , acceptable values are @xmath92  cm for reasonable values of @xmath89 ( @xmath93 , at which point the central x - ray source would be hidden ) .",
    "we label disks with a truncated outer radius td ( truncated disk ) .",
    "the third parameter , @xmath91 , must increase by three orders of magnitude above the nominal value to @xmath94  cm ( hd@xmath95 model ) .",
    "this limit needs justification  maintaining a disk with such an inner radius would be difficult .",
    "we plot these possible but unlikely disks that do satisfy our limits ( by changing the parameters listed above ) along with the x - ray spectrum in figure  [ fig : nufnu ] .    while making @xmath91 significantly greater than @xmath96 or @xmath84 ( in the hd@xmath95 model ) seems contrived , altering @xmath89 or @xmath90 are much less so .",
    "for most values of @xmath89 we need to truncate the disk at a radius of @xmath97  cm to accommodate our limits , similar to @xcite , which as they note is difficult to produce but not unprecedented .",
    "it is not likely that such a truncated disk would be able to provide sufficient material to power the sgr for its lifetime .",
    "even so , we examine the implications of the td model .",
    "as there have been no timing observations to constrain possible companions to sgr  0526@xmath166 , a companion could exist and provide an outer limit to the disk .",
    "the suggested 164 day periodicity @xcite in the bursts could be consistent with such a companion , but only if the eccentricity @xmath98 is @xmath99 , which seems unlikely .",
    "we examine the possible masses and radii of such companions in the td model .",
    "we do this by requiring @xmath100  cm , where we determined @xmath90 as the distance from a @xmath101 neutron star to the outermost stable orbit of a disk ( assumed to be in the orbital plane ) of pressureless particles @xcite .",
    "this then gives a constraint on the companion radius @xmath102 by requiring that it not overflow its roche lobe ( with the roche lobe radius determined using @xcite ) , as this would make the source a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) with substantially different properties .",
    "for a white dwarf with @xmath103  cm ( @xmath104 ) , @xmath105 for all companion masses @xmath106 and such a source is acceptable . a main - sequence star with @xmath107 ,",
    "however , would overflow @xmath102 for all @xmath108 .",
    "the mass limit is even lower if the effects of irradiation on the companion s radius @xcite are taken into account .",
    "also , main - sequence stars of type k or earlier ( and hotter white dwarfs ) are excluded photometrically .",
    "we therefore require a faint , compact companion : a planet , brown dwarf or cool white dwarf .",
    "however , producing a white dwarf in a very tight orbit around a @xmath109  yr old neutron star may be very difficult .",
    "thus the lack of an optical counterpart to sgr  0526@xmath166  places strong new constraints on accretions disk models .",
    "there are no clear predictions for the optical appearance of magnetars , and so one of the stars in the error circle ( section  [ sec : anal ] ) may be such a source .",
    "however , based on spin @xcite and spectral ( k00 ) properties , we believe that the sgrs and axps share a common origin .",
    "if this is the case , we can use optical data concerning axps @xcite along with the stellar appearances of sources a  i to exclude them from consideration as counterparts to sgr  0526@xmath166 .",
    "we therefore conclude that sgr  0526@xmath166   has not been detected .",
    "this gives an unabsorbed x - ray to optical flux ratio @xmath110 ( where @xmath111 is the integrated x - ray flux and @xmath112 ) .",
    "this ratio is extremely high  almost all neutron stars have lower ratios @xcite .",
    "we must account for this in our models for sgr  0526@xmath166 .",
    "a continuation of the possible blackbody emission found in the x - ray spectrum by k00 would be extremely faint in the optical , and could satisfy our limits ( see figure  [ fig : nufnu ] ) .",
    "however , given the nonthermal optical emission from radio pulsars as well as the emission from @xcite , we believe that the emission from sgr  0526@xmath166  would arise from another process .    we neither know nor can predict the details of this process , but we examine the emission heuristically to derive its basic properties .",
    "a continuation of the x - ray power - law is impossible . in general",
    ", a broken power - law is the simplest parameterization of the spectrum , with both the peak location and index below the peak as yet undetermined .",
    "simple choices for the index would be 2 ( thermal emission ) or 2.5 ( self - absorbed synchrotron emission ) , although most indices are possible .",
    "@xcite suggest that the optical emission for follows a power - law @xmath113 , with @xmath114 .",
    "this provides the motivation for the lines drawn on the sed in figure  [ fig : nufnu ] extending from the optical and meeting the x - ray spectrum in the hard - uv / soft x - ray . the lowest spectral index for a power - law could be 1.6 , which is when the spectrum peaks just at the lower limit of the cxo data ( 0.5  kev ; k00 ) , but this seems artificial .",
    "at the other extreme , if the power - law has @xmath115 , this would lead to the overall sed having a peak at @xmath63  nm and a luminosity of @xmath116 , or 10 times that inferred from x - ray observations alone ( k00 ; this also ignores particle and the likely extremely luminous neutrino emission ) .",
    "such a luminosity requires that we supply even more energy to the source during quiescence , further constraining the energetics and leading to @xmath117  g ( as noted by k00 ) , assuming that the source persists for @xmath118  yr ( suggested by the estimated age of the supernova remnant and and the spin - down timescales of other sgrs ; also see @xcite ) and that the magnetic field is the primary energy supplier .",
    "this is truly a magnetar - like field !",
    "the actual case is most likely between the two curves on figure  [ fig : nufnu ] , with a more gentle peak giving a more relaxed energy requirement , but one that still implies @xmath119  g.    such large fields may not be consistent with the association of the sgr with n49 , which has an age in the range @xmath120 kyr @xcite .",
    "calculations for axps @xcite indicate that a magnetar with an initial dipolar field of @xmath121  g would spin - down to the present day sgr spin period in only @xmath61000  yr , and increasing the field only makes the situation worse",
    ". however , for sgr  0526@xmath166these calculations are a simplification .",
    "the large ( @xmath122  g ) magnetic field would likely be tangled and exist close to the surface ( k00 ) ; this would then still dominate the energetics and produce crust stress but not the spin - down ( which also must incorporate winds ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the sgr  0526@xmath166/n49 association could be false , as has recently been found for other sgr / snr associations @xcite .",
    "k00 found that sgr  0526@xmath166  and n49 had the same value for @xmath32 , but they see no sign of interaction in x - rays and the projected position of sgr  0526@xmath166  is near the edge of n49 .",
    "sgr  0526@xmath166  could merely be associated with nearby star formation that led to a massive cluster ( like those for sgr  1900@xmath1914 and sgr  1806@xmath120 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which could have produced the n49 progenitor as well .",
    "a non - association could then allow the age of sgr  0526@xmath166  to come closer to @xmath123  yr , with a consequent reduction of @xmath124 by a factor of @xmath125 .",
    "either way , the energetic requirements of the sgr  0526@xmath166  sed provide a strong constraint on the magnetar model and formation scenario for this source .",
    "motivated by the detection of optical emission from an axp @xcite , we examine whether it is likely that we could detect sgr  0526@xmath166 . using the same x - ray to optical flux ratio as that for ( @xmath126 ; @xcite )",
    ", we estimate @xmath127 ( see figure  [ fig : nufnu ] ) , beyond current limits but within the range of hst .",
    "we have obtained deep hst images of the field containing sgr  0526@xmath166 .",
    "there does not appear to be a point - like optical counterpart consistent with either the colors or magnitudes of the disks described by @xcite . assuming a non - detection , optical limits place strong new constraints on both accretion disks and magnetars as the source of the x - ray luminosity and spindown .",
    "independent of the source s nature , however , if sgrs and axps are related , we might expect @xmath127 for sgr  0526@xmath166 , based on the optical to x - ray flux ratio of the one identified axp .",
