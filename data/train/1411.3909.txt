    "a simplest example of a heteroclinic cycle is a sequence of saddle type equilibrium points joined in a circle by connecting orbits . generically heteroclinic cycles are not robust under perturbations of the system ( changes of parameters ) , but for special classes of systems they may occur robustly , typically due to the presence of invariant hyperplanes .",
    "examples of special structures leading to robust heteroclinic cycles are symmetry , the existence of invariant planes corresponding to extinction of some species in lotka - volterra systems or existence of synchrony subspaces in coupled cell systems .",
    "heteroclinic networks are a generalization of heteroclinic cycles to sets of equilibria with more complicated connection structure .",
    "more generally , heteroclinic sets may consist of invariant sets connecting periodic or more complicated saddle type dynamics .",
    "the study of heteroclinic cycles was motivated by examples in fluid mechanics ( systems with symmetry ) @xcite and in population biology @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for an introduction to the subject .",
    "more recently , rabinovich and co - workers have proposed applications of robust heteroclinic cycles in neuroscience , see @xcite for an early review . among the contexts proposed in @xcite where heteroclinic dynamics could be relevant were central pattern generators ( cpgs ) and memory formation .",
    "these two applications were validated by some more detailed biological studies @xcite @xcite .",
    "the cpgs are circuits controlling the motoric function , and are known to support a variety of complex oscillations corresponding to different movements of the body . as shown in this paper , by slightly changing the coupling structure in the model one can obtain a variety of heteroclinic cycles and thereby complex periodic solutions .",
    "the idea of the memory application is similar  modifications of the coupling , arising from the action of the input , lead to the occurrence of periodic orbits , existing near heteroclinic cycles whose properties reflect the structure of the input .    the focus of this work is to study hopfield networks , which are the simplest models of memory circuits , with the goal of investigating the presence of heteroclinic cycles .",
    "+ hopfield introduced thirty years ago @xcite this model for learning sequences and associative memory in neural networks , in their simplest possible form . in the continuous time version , for each neuron @xmath0 in a network of @xmath1 neurons , the activity is modeled by the following equation ( activity model ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the activity variable ( membrane potential ) of neuron @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a constant external input on neuron @xmath0 .",
    "the function @xmath6 is strictly increasing and invertible , for example a sigmoid .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is the firing rate of neuron @xmath4 , that is the time rate of spikes which are emitted by the neuron .",
    "classically the function @xmath8 is used .",
    "the coupling coefficients @xmath9 define a @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 called the _",
    "connectivity matrix_. a positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) coefficient corresponds to an inhibitory ( resp .",
    "excitatory ) input from @xmath4 to @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath12 all neurons have the same state of rest @xmath13 . when coupling is switched on , other equilibria may exist depending on the coefficients @xmath9 .",
    "it is often assumed that @xmath11 is a symmetric matrix , implying that the dynamics of the network always converges to an equilibrium .",
    "each equilibrium is defined by a sequence of values @xmath14 called a _",
    "pattern_. depending upon the inputs @xmath5 , one or another equilibrium will be reached , a process that is interpreted as retrieving a pattern which has been earlier memorized through a tuning of the coupling coefficients in the network ( hebbian rule ) .",
    "+ the assumption that @xmath11 is symmetric is unnecessary to storing information , and besides experiments have shown that dynamical patterns are often present in neural circuits and seem to play an important role in various aspects , in particular generating periodic oscillations in cpg . in a recent work chuan et al .",
    "@xcite developed a method of converting strings of information , in the form of sequences of vectors with entries @xmath15 , into coupling matrices so the hopfield network with the resulting coupling architecture would have _ storing cycles _",
    ", i.e. periodic orbits carrying the information of the underlying sequence of vectors .",
    "the defining feature of a storing cycle associated to such sequence is that it visits the vicinity of each of its vector , preserving their order in the sequence . in another study chuan",
    "et al . @xcite used hopf bifurcation analysis to find storing cycles .",
    "+ a natural observation is that heteroclinic cycles between equilibria given by the elements of the sequence provide a natural approximation to storing cycles .",
    "however the simulations of @xcite and @xcite gave no evidence of the existence of heteroclinic cycles .",
    "in this work we show that after a small modification the systems studied in @xcite support heteroclinic cycles .",
    "our approach draws on the work of fukai and tanaka @xcite , who observed that by of replacing a non - differentiable term in the firing rate equations by a constant one obtains a lotka - volterra system , which supports robust heteroclinic cycles @xcite .",
    "this approach was subsequently used by @xcite and @xcite in their study robust heteroclinic cycles in firing rate models . in this work",
    "we continue the approach of @xcite , introducing some refinements to their approximation of the firing rate equations .",
    "we point out that the original firing rate equations can not support hateroclinic cycles due to the presence of non - smooth terms and introduce two methods of regularizing the equations . when the systems studied in @xcite are modified using either of our approaches heteroclinic cycles do exist and there is a direct correspondence between the input string / vector sequence / coupling structure and the resulting heteroclinic cycle . in this work",
    "we carry out a detailed study of this correspondence .",
    "system is often transformed to the _ firing rate formulation _ , by letting the firing rates @xmath16 be the dependent variables . in this section",
    "we make the same choice of @xmath17 as the authors of @xcite , namely @xmath18 in section [ sec - lvapprox ] , where we review some of the work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we make a brief switch to a different but equivalent choice of @xmath17 used by these authors .",
    "system transformed to the firing rate variables with @xmath17 given by has the form @xmath19^n\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath11 is the coupling matrix .",
    "we further decompose @xmath11 as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the identity matrix , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are non negative coefficients and @xmath25 .",
    "+ provided that @xmath26 the equation @xmath27 has a couple of non zero solutions @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "therefore when @xmath30 , any vector of the form @xmath31 with @xmath32 is a stable steady - state of . if we think of vectors of the form @xmath33 as information strings in a neural network , then the above steady - states represent stored memory states .",
    "however it is well - known that memory states need not be steady ( see @xcite and references therein ) . if @xmath34 the steady - states may become unstable or even disappear , but nevertheless information may still be dynamically stored .",
    "we now explain the idea of information storage by means of limit cycles of ( storing cycles ) , as explored in @xcite and then we introduce our idea to use robust heteroclinic cycles instead .",
    "+ the basic question adressed in @xcite is the following : given an information string , can it be stored by a hopfield network in the form of dynamic information , more specifically a limit cycle ? concretely , the information is given in the form of a string of binary @xmath35-vectors ( with components equal to @xmath15 ) .",
    "the learning rule , consistent with hebbian learning , is an algorithm specifying how the information string structures the coupling matrix @xmath36 ( we forget from now on the subscript 1 in @xmath37 ) .",
    "this learning rule will be described in detail in section [ sec - eqnetarc ] .",
    "the main research question of @xcite is whether the system with the coupling structure resulting from applying the learning rule supports stable limit cycles that code the original information string in the sense that the periodic orbit passes through the quadrants of @xmath38 corresponding to the elements of the information string , following its order .    in this article",
    "we focus on a different version of such encoding by the dynamics , choosing a robust heteroclinic cycle as the invariant object encoding the information string .",
    "the condition we impose is that the cycle should connect equilibrium points located at vertices of the cube @xmath39^n$ ] corresponding to the elements of the information string , following its order .",
    "this is a rather natural condition , yet the first obstacle we must overcome is that with @xmath40 as given by the rhs of is not @xmath41 on the cube @xmath39^n$ ] , so that heteroclinic cycles can not exist .",
    "we discuss this problem in more detail and propose a solution in the next section , which also relates to the work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the articles @xcite , @xcite and @xcite consider the question of the existence of robust heteroclinic cycles in the firing rate version of and show that such cycles exist for a lotka - volterra approximation of the system . in this section",
    "we use a different combination of @xmath17 and @xmath42 consistent with choice made in these articles .",
    "specifically we will use the functions : @xmath43 the coefficients @xmath9 are assumed to be all positive so that the synaptic couplings are all of inhibitory type .",
    "we define the firing rate by @xmath44 and transform to the firing rate formulation . after applying a time rescaling we obtain the following system .",
    "@xmath45 note that system is well defined and continuous on the cube @xmath46^n$ ] , but it is not smooth on the faces , with the term @xmath47 being the source of non - smootheness .",
    "as we are interested in heteroclinic cyles that lie on the edges , with connections in the faces , this becomes a problem for the existence and stability of the cycle .    since our purpose is merely to illustrate the problem of the lack of smoothness",
    "we restrict our attention to the simplest case @xmath48 . then has the form @xmath49 for simplicity we assume @xmath50 .",
    "the goal is to construct heteroclinic cycles connecting equilibria of the form : @xmath51 the jacobian matrix at such equilibria is given as follows : @xmath52 since @xmath40 blows up at @xmath53 the jacobian is undefined .",
    "if the term is neglected in the rhs of each equation of then a heteroclinic cycle can be easily found , with @xmath54 giving an example @xcite .",
    "we propose two approaches to regularize the function @xmath40 .",
    "first approach , which we use in this paper , is to replace @xmath40 defined in by its taylor polynomial at @xmath55 .",
    "we denote such taylor polynomial of degree @xmath56 as @xmath57 .",
    "note that the sequence @xmath58 diverges at @xmath53 and @xmath59 when @xmath60 , but converges uniformly to @xmath40 on any compact subinterval in @xmath61 .",
    "another approach is to replace @xmath40 by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a small parameter .",
    "the function @xmath64 is well defined on the interval @xmath46 $ ] , yet its properties are similar to @xmath40 , in particular its derivative at @xmath53 and @xmath59 equals @xmath65 , thus is very large .",
    "if we replace @xmath40 by @xmath57 or @xmath64 in then , depending on the relative size of @xmath66 and @xmath56 or @xmath63 , any of the three possibilities can arise :    1 .   the cycle does not exist , 2 .",
