    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation @xcite and an atom laser @xcite have sparked many theoretical and experimental studies of coherent atomic matter .",
    "it is well understood that matter - wave analog of nonlinear optical interactions is provided by inter - atomic collisions .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath0-wave scattering regime , two - body collisions are mathematically equivalent to a optical kerr interaction .",
    "hence , many of the concepts of first developed in optics can readily be extended to bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid to these lines , including the study of matter - wave solitons @xcite , phase conjugation @xcite , four - wave mixing @xcite , an atom laser @xcite , atom holography @xcite , etc .",
    "especially , pulsed and continuous - wave atom lasers @xcite and the four - wave mixing with matter waves @xcite have been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "the experimental verification of the other predictions is also underway .    as is well known that polarization @xcite is an important property that is common to all types of vector waves .",
    "light waves possess this property and so do elastic and spin waves in solids , for example . in this paper",
    "we study bec polarization that arises for matter waves by considering the two components of a two - component bec as two polarizations .",
    "the motivation for present study is twofold .",
    "first , the bec polarization is interesting in itself and deserves further examination . from a basic point of view",
    ", it significantly extends the already well - established range of analogies between light and matter waves .",
    "second , more importantly perhaps , it may also have useful practical applications .",
    "we shall investigate nonlinear polarization dynamics of the bec and study influence of decoherence induced by noncondensate atoms .",

    "@xmath9 is a linear interaction term , it describes an atomic josephson tunnelling process .",
    "@xmath10 are trapping potentials .",

    "in order to discuss the polarization properties of the two - component bec , it is convenient to define the hermitian stokes operators @xcite as @xmath45 which satisfy the commutation relations : @xmath46=2i\\epsilon _ { jkl}\\hat{s}_l$ ] and @xmath47=0 $ ] .",

    "any polarization state of the bec can be completely described by the four stokes parameters which can be written as a string : @xmath53 .",

    "bec polarization states can be described by a poincar sphere plotted in fig .",
