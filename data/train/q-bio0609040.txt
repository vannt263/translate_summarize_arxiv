    "aging is a complex and incompletely understood process characterized by deteriorating cellular , organ , and system function .",
    "replicative senescence , the phenomenon whereby normal somatic cells show a finite proliferative capacity , is thought to be a major contributor to this decline @xcite .",
    "telomeres are repetitive dna sequences ( ( ttaggg)@xmath0 in human cells ) at both ends of each linear chromosome and their role is to protect the coding part of the dna .",
    "normal human somatic cells become senescent after a finite number of doublings .    as a general rule , cells for which telomerase activity is absent lose of the order of 100 base pairs of telomeric dna from chromosome ends in every cell division .",
    "this basal loss has been attributed to the end replication problem @xcite in which the dna - polymerase can not replicate all the way to the end of the chromosome during dna lagging strand synthesis .",
    "additional post - replicative processing of the telomeric dna is necessary to protect the end of the chromosome from being recognized as a double strand break in need of repair .",
    "this processing also contributes to the end replication problem .",
    "what remains unexplained , however , is why senescent cells occur in cell cultures long before the expected number of cell divisions estimated from the gradual basal loss .",
    "it has been shown recently that in addition to the basal loss of @xmath1 base pairs per division , a complex set of events that leads to telomere exchange between sister chromatids can occur .",
    "this telomere sister chromatid exchange ( t - sce ) , together with basal telomere loss and a number of observed or suggested telomere recombination events , collectively define telomere dynamics , and this dynamics leads to a wide distribution of telomere lengths in cell cultures @xcite .",
    "telomere exchange can also occur between the telomeres of different chromosomes .",
    "currently available data can not distinguish between this process and t - sce .",
    "it is also believed that sister chromosome exchange is induced by dna damage . because the sister chromatids are in closer proximity compared to the distance between different chromatids , it can be hypothesize that the probability for telomere interchromatid exchange ( t - ice ) is smaller than the probability for sister chromatid exchange between sister chromatids .",
    "recently , one of the present authors proposed a theory @xcite , based on telomere dynamics including t - sce and t - ice , that is capable of explaining werner s syndrome , an inherited disease characterized by premature aging and death , and a subset of cancers that seem to use a recombination mechanism to maintain telomere length .",
    "this latter mechanism , known as alternative lengthening of telomeres ( alt ) , as well as additional telomerase activity in some cases , are thought to contribute to the large proliferative potential of these cells @xcite .",
    "here proliferative potential denotes the time over which cells can continue to divide . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that both werner s syndrome and alt can be described within the general framework of telomere dynamics in which there is an elevated rate of exchange of telomere dna between two daughter cells , as observed in many experiments @xcite .",

    "@xcite is a transition from finite to infinite proliferative potential in a cell culture as the parameters controlling the telomere recombination rates are varied",
    ".     units . upon division ,",
    "each telomere ostensibly shortens by @xmath2 units , but additional exchange of @xmath3 units between daughter telomeres ( dashed ) leads to final lengths of 8 and 12.,scaledwidth=27.5% ]    in this work , we analytically investigate an idealized model of cell proliferation in which the number of cell divisions before senescence occurs is controlled by the dynamics of telomeres during cell division .",
    "each cell contains a certain number of telomeres .",
    "when a cell divides , the telomeres in each daughter cell ostensibly shorten by a fixed amount @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to this systematic telomere shortening , the effect of t - sce processes during cell division leads to a superimposed stochastic component to the telomere length dynamics by an amount @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "thus in each cell division event , the length of an individual telomere evolves by the combined effects of these systematic and stochastic mechanisms .    when the length @xmath6 of any of the telomeres within a cell reaches zero , the cell stops dividing and becomes senescent .",
    "on the other hand , the stochastic component of the telomere dynamics provides the possibility for a telomere to occasionally grow when a cell divides .",
    "this sub - population of cells with long telomeres and thus higher proliferative potential can become even more so at the next cell division , a mechanism that allows a long - lived subpopulation to thrive .",
    "we are interested in basic statistical properties of the cell proliferative potential .",
    "some fundamental questions that we will study include :    1 .",
    "can a cell population divide indefinitely ? 2 .",
    "how long does it take for a cell population to become senescent ?",
    "how many dividing cells exist after a given number of divisions ?    within an idealized model of telomere kinetics described by eq .   for a single telomere per cell",
    ", it is possible to answer these questions analytically by mapping the telomere dynamics to a first - passage process . using this approach",
    ", we find a phase transition between a finite - lifetime cell population and immortality as a function of three basic control parameters  the magnitude of the systematic part of the telomere evolution , determined by @xmath4 , the effective diffusion coefficient associated with the stochastic part of the telomere evolution , determined by @xmath7 , and the cell division rate .",
    "in our telomere replication model , we assume that the initial length of each telomere in a cell is @xmath8 . in any cell division event , the length of a telomere changes by two distinct processes :    1 .   a systematic shortening of each telomere by @xmath4 ; 2 .   an additional stochastic component of the length change of magnitude @xmath5",
    "thus the length of a telomere changes according to @xmath9 here the stochastic variable @xmath5 accounts for the t - sce processes that we assume to have mean value equal to zero , @xmath10 , and no correlations at different times , @xmath11 .",
    "the justification for the absence of correlation is that t - sce events have been linked to dna damage @xcite , which occurs randomly in the cell .",
    "because of the systematic and stochastic contributions to the change in telomere length in each division event , the length of a telomere undergoes a biased random walk , with a bias toward shrinking .",
    "it is instructive to estimate the relative importance of the systematic and stochastic components of this length evolution . for this purpose ,",
    "we define the time unit as the physical time between cell divisions @xmath12 .",
    "thus in the absence of stochasticity a telomere shrinks to zero length in @xmath13 cell division events .",
    "it is now helpful to recall some basic numbers about human telomeres to connect our mechanistic telomere model and real cell division :    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the quantity @xmath5 is known only very roughly .",
    "it is possible , with low probability , that even whole telomeres can be lost in tce processes @xcite .    with the above numbers , a telomere shrinks to zero in @xmath14 cell division events with purely deterministic shrinking .",
    "now consider the role of stochasticity : in @xmath15 cell divisions , the root - mean - square length change due to stochastic events is @xmath16 .",
    "thus in the time for a telomere to systematically shrink from @xmath17 to zero , stochasticity gives a length uncertainty of @xmath18a 10% correction to the bias .",
    "finally , we need to include the role of cell division on this biased random walk description to arrive at a theory for telomere dynamics .",
    "that is , we need to allow a random walk to replicate as it undergoes biased hopping . while there are many ways to parameterize the effects of bias , stochasticity , and replication in the continuum limit",
    ", all such models lead to the following convection - diffusion equation with multiplicative growth : @xmath19 in which @xmath20 represents the bias for telomere shrinking , @xmath21 accounts for the stochastic part of the telomere length evolution , and @xmath22 accounts for cell division . while there is only an indirect connection between the model parameters @xmath23 , and the parameters @xmath24 that account for what happens to a telomere in a single cell division , this continuum description has the advantage of capturing the physical essence of telomere dynamics while being analytically tractable .",
    "the basic question that we seek to understand is how long it takes for a cell to become senescent , an event that occurs when the length of one of its telomeres reaches zero .",
    "this condition translates to an absorbing boundary condition at @xmath25 for the biased diffusion process that described the telomere length distribution .",
    "we now exploit some classic results about the first - passage probability of biased diffusion ( see appendix and @xcite ) to determine the evolution of the telomere length distribution .",
    "let the initial number of cells be @xmath26 .",
    "the solution of is simply @xmath27 where @xmath28 , given in , is the solution to the convection - diffusion equation with an absorbing boundary condition at @xmath25 and the initial condition that all cells have initial telomere length @xmath8 .",
    "we may also treat the situation in which each cell contains @xmath29 _ independent _ telomeres as a zeroth - order description for cells that contain many telomeres whose dynamics is coupled by the t - sce exchange process ( schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "this assumption of independence of different telomeres allows us to apply the single telomere per cell first - passage description with only minor modifications . for cells containing @xmath29 independent telomeres of lengths @xmath30 , the density of cells",
    "@xmath31 satisfies the @xmath29-dimensional convection - diffusion - growth equation @xmath32 with absorbing boundaries when any telomere length @xmath33 reaches 0 .",
    "the solution simply factorizes as a product of one - dimensional solutions @xmath34 if each telomere has initial length @xmath8 , all the @xmath35 are the same and are given by",
    ". we can also straightforwardly study the case where each telomere has a different initial length by merely using the unique initial length of each telomere in eq .  .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in addition to its application to cell division statistics , eq .",
    "is also related to the fleming - viot ( fv ) process @xcite in which a population of diffusing particles can get absorbed at boundary point and then be re - injected into the system at a rate that is proportional to local particle density .    from our description of telomere dynamics as a biased branching - diffusion process",
    ", we now determine basic features about the time dependence of the cell population and the statistics of telomere lengths .",
    "cells in which each telomere has positive length can divide .",
    "the number of such active cells is given by the integral of the number density of cells over the positive @xmath36-tant ( @xmath37 ) of length space : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the survival probability of a biased random walk ( given by ) .",
    "from , the long - time behavior of @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "thus the fundamental parameters of the system are the pclet number @xmath43 @xcite , a dimensionless measure of the relative importance of the bias and the stochasticity and , more importantly , the dimensionless growth rate , @xmath44 . note that both the diffusion coefficient @xmath21 and the bias velocity @xmath20 are proportional to @xmath22 , since the telomere length changes occur only when a cell divides . as a result",
    ", the growth rate @xmath44 is actually independent of @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath45 , cell division is insufficient to overcome the effect of inexorable death due to the systematic component of the telomere shortening and the population of dividing cells decays exponentially in time .",

    "( [ nt1 ] ) to obtain the total number of dividing cells .",
    "since cells double at each time step , @xmath47 when we express @xmath48 in units of cell division times .",

    "thus , using the numbers appropriate for humans , senescence or immortality is controlled by details of telomere evolution as encoded by the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "( [ nsen ] ) cancel and @xmath78 .",
    "thus as @xmath79 ( no division ) , the initial cell immediately becomes senescent so that the total number of senescent cells that are produced equals one .",
    "this unrealistic result arises because in the continuum description telomeres can shrink to zero length before any cell division can occur . on the other hand , for @xmath80 ,",
    "the population is immortal and an infinite number of senescent cells are produced during the evolution .",
    "a curious aspect of the population of dividing cells is the dependence of the cell density on telomere length as @xmath81 . for any number of telomeres per cell @xmath29 ,",
    "the telomere length distribution is independent of this number , since the distribution is simply proportional to @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ cxt ] ) . in the @xmath81 limit",
    ", we then obtain @xmath82 thus apart from an overall time - dependent factor , the density of dividing cells in which the constituent telomere has length @xmath6 is linear in @xmath6 for small lengths and has an exponential cutoff for large lengths . from the distribution given in eq .",
    ", the mean telomere length goes to a constant for large times @xmath83 independent of whether the total cell population is growing or decaying .",
    "the variance of the telomere length also approaches a constant @xmath84    a more pedantic way to arrive at this same result is to compute the exact time - dependent mean telomere length @xmath85 using eq .   for @xmath28 and then taking the @xmath81 limit .",
    "in summary , the mean telomere length is time independent , as predicted by the asymptotic form of the telomere length distribution in eq .",
    "( [ c - asymp ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that this result pertains to the fraction of cells that are active .",
    "if all cells  senescent and active  are included in the average , then @xmath86 would asymptotically decay with time .      as discussed above , for @xmath45 ,",
    "all cells eventually become senescent . however , for @xmath87 , a subpopulation of infinitely dividing cells arise so that the average cell population becomes immortal .",
    "we make this statement more precise by computing the average lifetime of the population for @xmath45 .",
    "this lifetime is defined as the average age of each cell when it becomes senescent and is thus given by @xmath88 where we use for @xmath89 , the number of cells that become senescent at time @xmath48 .",
    "more simply , the mean proliferative potential ( lifetime ) can also be obtained from the total number of senescent cells via @xmath90 .    using the general definition of eq .  , it is straightforward to compute higher moments of the lifetime for the case @xmath53 . here",
    "the integrals in can be written in terms of the modified bessel functions of the second kind ( see # 12 in 3.471 of ref .",

    "the variance of the lifetime is @xmath93 in fact , the @xmath94 cumulant can be obtained simply from the general formula @xcite @xmath95 therefore for the higher moments of the lifetime , the diffusion coefficient does play an essential role .    for @xmath53",
    ", we immediately obtain from eq .",
    "@xmath96 thus the mean cell proliferative potential diverges to infinity as @xmath97 from below .",
    "this result for the number of cell divisions before senescence is one of our primary results .",
    "notice that in the case of no cell division ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) the average lifetime @xmath100 .",
    "that is , @xmath101 coincides with the time for a biased diffusing particle to be convected to the origin .",
    "it is surprising at first sight that diffusion plays no role in determining the average number of cell divisions .",
    "exactly the same type of result arises for the discrete random walk with a bias @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "a useful characterization of the number of cell divisions distribution function of a population is the _ senescence rate _ @xmath102 .",
    "the senescence ( or mortality ) rate is the ratio of the number of cells that become senescent at time @xmath48 to the total number of cells that are still dividing at this time .",
    "equivalently , the senescence rate is the probability that a randomly chosen dividing cell becomes senescent at the next moment .",

    "this phenomenon is known as the _ mortality plateau_. namely , the probability that the somatic cells of an organism become senescent becomes _ independent _ of its age in the long - time limit .",
    "this surprising fact was observed experimentally in human populations @xcite and for fruit flies @xcite .",
    "it was also observed numerically in a model of aging that is similar to ours @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a senescence plateau is actually typical of a wide range of markov processes @xcite .",
    "we studied an idealized model for the dynamics of telomere lengths during cell division that is based on a systematic basal loss and a stochastic component to the evolution that arises from telomere sister chromatid exchange .",
    "this model captures essential features of telomere dynamics in cell cultures . because of the competing influences of cell division , which obviously increases the number of proliferative cells , and the general trend of telomere shortening",
    ", we showed that there is a phase transition between a normal state where a cell culture becomes senescent to a new state where a cell culture can become immortal .    from our theory",
    ", we were able to answer the basic questions posed in the introduction . specifically :    1 .",
    "we determined the condition for whether a cell population ultimately becomes senescent or whether it continues to divide _",
    "ad infinitum_. the transition between these two regimes is given by the condition @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a dimensionless measure of the relative effect of cell division , random fluctuations , and basal loss in the length evolution of a telomere .",
    "we also found that for the case of @xmath53 telomere per cell , the mean time for a cell population to become senescent is @xmath109 for @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the initial length of the telomere , @xmath20 is the amount by which the telomere shrinks by basal loss in each division , and @xmath42 is a dimension measure of the relative importance of cell division to basal loss .",
    "finally , we found that the total number of cells produced before the entire cell culture becomes senescent becomes extremely large as @xmath110 approaches its critical value from below , as presented in eq .  .",
    "our results may be helpful for understanding how alt cells maintain their telomeres . in these cells , increased t - sce rate , and wide telomere size distribution , and increased cell lifetimes have been observed @xcite .",
    "these observations are all natural outcomes from our model .",
    "how these results depend on the number of short telomeres and on the details of the t - sce process are very important questions that are under investigation .",
