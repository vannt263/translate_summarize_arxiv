    "in recent years there has been a great interest in the applications of physical approaches to a quantitative description of social and economic processes @xcite .",
    "the development of the interdisciplinary field of the `` science of complexity '' has lead to the insight that complex dynamic processes may also result from simple interactions , and even social structure formation could be well described within a mathematical approach .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in modeling the human society in order to understand the process of opinion formation applied to political elections .",
    "many different approaches have been taken by scientists in this matter .",
    "the simplest choice is to consider a uniform society , where all the persons are considered equal and have the same influence on all the others .",
    "the second choice is to consider a society divided into two groups , a group of normal people and a group of leaders ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is to consider all the individuals different from one another",
    ". this can be the case of the kauffman model , where every individual has different ( randomly generated ) features and interacts randomly with a certain number of other individuals . despite its simplicity , this model is able to exhibit very complex behaviors , including chaos .    in this paper",
    "we start exploring the behavior of a model of an uniform society . by uniform",
    "we mean that everybody is exactly like the others , except for the expressed opinion ( that may vary with time ) .",
    "all other parameters are exactly the same .",
    "we use a simple neural network model to approximate the process of opinion formation taking place in a society . with this approximation ,",
    "the individual is represented by an automaton that receives some external inputs , elaborates them using a certain function , and elaborates a response .    as a first step , we study the behavior of the simplest , one - dimensional neural network , composed by binary perceptrons .",
    "such a model has been successfully applied to anticipate personal preferences on products ( see ref .",
    "the inputs for each perceptron are given by the opinions expressed by other persons in a local community , whose size is @xmath0 .",
    "the parameters of the model are the influence of the mass - media ( @xmath1 ) , the weight @xmath2 assigned to the the local community ( that can be thought as the result of education ) , and the conformist threshold @xmath3 .",
    "this last parameter models the empirical fact that even a strong mass - media campaign or a strong anti - conformist attitude can not modify an opinion if it is supported by a strong majority in the local community .",
    "if the local majority is outside the thresholded intervals , the evolution rule is that of a monte - carlo simulation of an equilibrium system with heat - bath dynamics .    the system may be trapped into one of the two absorbing states ( uniform opinion ) , or exhibit several kinds of irregular behavior .",
    "technically , it is an extension of a probabilistic cellular automata with a very rich phase diagram  @xcite , whose mean - field approximation was described in ref .",
    "a detailed investigation of its behavior will be illustrated elsewhere  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present this probabilistic cellular automata model and present the main results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lyap ] we extend the concept of lyapunov exponents to probabilistic cellular automata and present the results obtained for our model . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we summarize our work and draw some conclusions .",
    "let @xmath4 be the opinion assumed by individual @xmath5 at time @xmath6 . as usual in spin models , only two different opinions , -1 and 1 , are possible .",
    "the system is made up of @xmath7 individuals arranged on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "time is considered discrete ( corresponding , for instance , to election events ) .",
    "the state of the whole system at time @xmath6 is given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the individual opinion is formed according to a local community `` pressure '' and a global influence . in order to avoid a tie ,",
    "the local community is made up of @xmath10 individuals , including the opinion of the individual himself at previous time .",
    "the average opinion of the local community around site ( person ) @xmath5 at time @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a parameter controlling the influence of the local field in the opinion formation process and @xmath1 be the external social pressure .",
    "one could think of @xmath1 as the television influence , and @xmath2 as the educational effects .",
    "the `` field '' @xmath1 pushes toward one opinion or the other , and people educated toward conformist will have @xmath12 , while non - conformists will have @xmath13 .",
    "the hypothesis of alignment with an overwhelming local majority is represented by the parameter @xmath3 , indicating the critical size of local majority . if @xmath14 , then @xmath15 , and if @xmath16 , then @xmath17 .    for simpler numerical implementation and plotting ,",
    "the opinions ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) are replaced by ( @xmath20,@xmath19 ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath21 the sum of opinions in the local community using the new coding .",
    "the `` magnetization '' can by expressed as @xmath22 , and the probability @xmath23 of expressing opinion @xmath19 given @xmath21 neighbors with opinion @xmath19 is :    @xmath24    for @xmath25 the model reduces to an ising spin system .",
    "for all @xmath26 we have two absorbing homogeneous states , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , corresponding to an infinite plaquette coupling in the statistical mechanical sense . with these assumptions",
    ", the model reduces to a one - dimensional , one - component , totalistic cellular automaton with two absorbing states .",
    "the order parameter is the fraction @xmath29 of people sharing opinion @xmath19 . ] .",
    "it is zero or one in the two absorbing states , and assumes other values in the active phase .",
    "the model is symmetric since the two absorbing states have the same importance .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     behavior of @xmath36 for @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 ( long dashed ) , @xmath42 ( solid ) , @xmath43 ( dashed ) and @xmath44 ( dotted ) .",
    "letters correspond to patterns in fig  [ fig : patterns].,width=302 ]    typical patterns for @xmath40 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] . roughly speaking , for ferromagnetic ( @xmath12 ) coupling",
    ", the only stable asymptotic states are the absorbing ones .",
    "the system quickly coalesce into large patches of zeroes and ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns]-d ) , whose borders perform a sort of random motion until they annihilate pairwise . for @xmath13 the stable phase",
    "is represented by an _",
    "active _ state , with a mixture of zeroes and ones . for @xmath45",
    "the automaton become deterministic , of `` chaotic '' type ( for r=3 it is wolfram s rule 150 ) .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] , when @xmath0 is greater than 3 , the quantity @xmath36 is no more a monotonic function of @xmath46 , and a new , _ less disordered _ phase appears inside the active one for small values of @xmath46 .",
    "this phase is characterized by a large number of metastable states , that become truly absorbing only in the limit @xmath47 . for reasons explained in the following",
    ", we shall denote the new phase by the term _ irregular _ , and the remaining portion of the active phase _ disordered_. by further increasing @xmath0 , both transitions become sharper , and the size of the disordered phase shrinks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] . by enlarging the transition region",
    "one sees that for @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h0 ] ) the transitions are composed by two sharp bends , which are not finite - size or time effects . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns]-c , in this range of parameters the probability of observing a local absorbing configurations ( i.e.  patches of zeroes or ones ) is vanishing .",
    "all others local configurations have finite probability of originating zeroes or ones in the next time step .",
    "the observed transitions are essentially equivalent to those of an equilibrium system , that in one dimension and for short - range interactions can not exhibit a true phase transition .",
    "the bends thus become real salient points only in the limit @xmath48 .",
    "the origin of the order - disorder ( ii ) and disorder - irregular ( i ) phase transition is due to the loss of stability of the fixed point @xmath49 given by the mean field approximation .",
    "more detailed considerations can be found in @xcite .",
    "comparisons between numerical ( thin line ) and mean - field ( thick dotted line ) results for @xmath44 and @xmath40 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the estimated critical values are @xmath51 and @xmath52 . , width=302 ]    for @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h0 ] ) the period - doubling phase brings the local configuration into an absorbing state , and the lattice dynamics is therefore driven by interactions among patches which are locally absorbing .",
    "this essentially corresponds to the dynamics of a deterministic cellular automata ( dca ) of _ chaotic _ type , i.e.   a system which is insensitive of infinitesimal perturbations but reacts in an unpredictable way to _",
    "finite _ perturbations .",
    "state variables in cellular automata are discrete , and thus the usual chaoticity analysis classifies them as stable systems .",
    "the occurrence of disordered patterns and their propagation in stable dynamical systems can be classified into two main groups : _ transient chaos _ and _ stable chaos_.    transient chaos is an irregular behavior of finite lifetime characterized by the coexistence in the phase space of stable attractors and chaotic non attracting sets  namely chaotic saddles or repellers  @xcite . after a transient irregular behavior ,",
    "the system generally collapses abruptly onto a non - chaotic attractor .",
    "cellular automata do not display this kind of behavior , which however may be present in systems having a discrete dynamics as a limiting case  @xcite .",
    "stable chaos constitutes a different kind of transient irregular behavior @xcite which can not be ascribed to the presence of chaotic saddles and therefore to divergence of nearby trajectories .",
    "moreover , the lifetime of this transient regime may scale exponentially with the system size ( supertransients  @xcite ) , and the final stable attractor is practically never reached for large enough systems .",
    "one is thus allowed to assume that such transients may be of substantial experimental interest and become the only physically relevant states in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the emergence of this `` chaoticity '' in dca dynamics , is effectively illustrated by the damage spreading analysis  @xcite , which measures the sensitivity to initial conditions and for this reason is considered as the natural extension of the lyapunov technique to discrete systems . in this method , indeed , one monitors the behavior of the distance between two replicas of the system evolving from slightly different initial conditions .",
    "the dynamics is considered unstable and the dca is said chaotic , whenever a small initial difference between replicas spreads through the whole system . on the contrary , if the initial difference eventually freezes or disappears , the dca is considered non chaotic .    due to the limited number of states of the automata however ,",
    "damage spreading does not account for the maximal `` production of uncertainty '' , since the two replicas may synchronize locally just by chance ( self - annihilation of the damage ) .",
    "moreover , there are different definitions of damage spreading for the same rule  @xcite .    to better understand the nature of the active phase , and up to what extent it can be denoted _ chaotic _ , we extend the finite - distance lyapunov exponent definition  @xcite to probabilistic cellular automata .",
    "a similar approach has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite , calculating the lyapunov exponents of a kauffman random boolean network in the annealed approximation .",
    "as shown in this latter paper , this computation gives the value of the ( classic ) lyapunov exponent obtained by the analysis of time - series data using the wolf algorithm .",
    "given a boolean function @xmath53 , we define the boolean derivative @xmath54 , as @xmath55 which represents a measure of sensitivity of a function with respect to its arguments .",
    "the evolution rule of a probabilistic cellular automaton may be thought as a boolean function that depends also by one or more random arguments . in our case @xmath56,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is defined by eq .",
    "and @xmath59 $ ] is the truth function , which gives 1 if the statement is true and 0 otherwise . in this case",
    "the derivative is taken with respect to @xmath60 by keeping @xmath61 constant .    for a cellular automaton rule",
    ", we can thus build the jacobian @xmath62 .",
    "this jacobian depends generally on the point in phase - space ( the configurations ) belonging to a given trajectory . in the case of a probabilistic automaton",
    ", the trajectory also depends on the choice of the random numbers @xmath61 .",
    "contour plot of the maximum lyapunov @xmath63 exponents for different values of neighborhood size @xmath0 and conformist parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the solid line represent the boundary between the @xmath64 phase and the @xmath65 one .",
    ", width=302 ]    finally , the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath63 is computed in the usual way by measuring the expansion rate of a `` tangent '' vector @xmath66 , whose time evolution is given by @xmath67 as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , a component @xmath68 of this tangent vector may be thought as the maximum number of different paths following which any initial ( @xmath69 ) damage may reach the site @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , without self - annihilation . when all components of @xmath70 become zero ( @xmath65 ) , no information about the initial configuration may `` percolate '' to @xmath71 , and the asymptotic configuration is determined only by the random numbers used",
    "this maximum lyapunov exponent is also related to the synchronization properties of automata  @xcite .    a preliminary numerical computation of @xmath63 for our model",
    "is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] . it can be noticed that the boundary @xmath72 of @xmath73 is not monotonic with @xmath0 , reaching a maximum value for @xmath74 . by comparisons with fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] , one can see that the chaotic phase is included in the irregular one .",
    "we have investigated a probabilistic cellular automaton model of an uniform society , with forcing local majority .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is extremely rich , showing a quiescent phase and several , active phases , with different dynamical behaviors .",
    "we have analyzed the properties and boundaries of these phases using direct numerical simulations , mean - field approximations and extending the notion of finite - distance lyapunov exponent to probabilistic cellular automata .",
