    "astrometric and radial - velocity ( rv ) planet detections are , from a mathematical standpoint , extremely similar . in each ,",
    "one models 1-dimensional projections of kepler orbits and attempts to fit kepler parameters . in the limit of circular orbits ,",
    "the planet signature is encoded in the simple form @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the astrometric and velocity semi - amplitudes for the two cases , and where @xmath6 designate the period @xmath7 and phase @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "one then goes on to combine information about the star s mass and ( for astrometry ) its distance , to infer the planet mass @xmath9 ( astrometry ) or @xmath10 ( rv ) , where @xmath11 is the inclination . in the astrometric case ,",
    "there are of course two such equations , one for each direction in the plane of the sky , whose ratio gives @xmath12 , and so permit one to break the @xmath10 degeneracy that plagues the intrinsically 1-dimensional rv measurement .",
    "because the form of equation ( [ eqn : basicform ] ) is essentially identical in the two cases , it is generally assumed that the error properties , i.e. , the relation between the measurement errors and the derived - parameter errors , is also the same .",
    "of course , it is well known that the parameter errors have a different dependence on semimajor axis @xmath13 , system distance @xmath14 , etc .",
    "most notably , with other parameters held fixed , astrometric sensitivity increases linearly with @xmath13 whereas rv sensitivity declines as @xmath15 .",
    "but here i am referring to something else .",
    "the differences just mentioned all impact the final result because they change the characteristic signal - to - noise ratio of the experiment , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of measurements and @xmath18 is the error in each measurement ( assumed for simplicity to be all the same ) . here",
    "i will show that the astrometric and rv measurements have substantially different error properties even when snr is identical .",
    "i will work within the framework of the minimum variance bound ( mvb ) , also frequently called the fisher - matrix approximation . as the same approximation will be applied to both techniques",
    ", this will allow me to highlight the difference between them .",
    "of course , if equation ( [ eqn : basicform ] ) really did fully represent both techniques , there could not be any difference in their error properties .",
    "however , the true functional forms of the source motions are actually @xmath19 for simplicity , i will continue to assume circular orbits , and i will assume for the astrometric case that the orbit is seen edge - on .",
    "in fact , the latter is not much of an approximation since in most cases the great majority of the information about the mass and period comes from the major axis of the apparent astrometric ellipse .",
    "finally , i will assume that the data are taken uniformly in time , at intervals that are frequent compared to the orbital period , and that they all have the same error , @xmath18 .    for a _ single - planet _",
    "i.e. , a system composed of just a star and a planet , in which the star does not suffer any other accelerations , @xmath20 for the rv case , but @xmath21 for the astrometric case . for rv , @xmath22 is the systemic radial velocity of the system . for astrometry",
    ", @xmath23 is the systemic proper motion of the system , while @xmath22 is the zero point of that motion .",
    "the introduction of the nuisances parameters @xmath22 or @xmath24 is what distinguishes the two cases statistically .",
    "the difference appears only for @xmath25 or @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the duration of the experiment .",
    "i have implicitly assumed that @xmath28 , and this is the reason that i ignore parallax , which would be an additional nuisance parameter for astrometry , but not for rv .    in the fisher - matrix approximation ,",
    "the inverse covariance matrix of the parameters , @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 one easily finds that for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are completely uncorrelated from the other parameters , so that @xmath35 that is , @xmath36 , which is the fractional error in astrometric or rv amplitude depends only on snr , and in a very simple way . similarly , @xmath37    however , as @xmath7 approaches @xmath27 , the parameters of primary interest ( mass and period ) become correlated with the nuisance parameters .",
    "to calculate this effect , i employ equations ( [ eqn : bij ] ) and ( [ eqn : fi ] ) , but using the full 7-parameter kepler formalism , not just the three kepler parameters displayed in equations ( [ eqn : basicform ] ) and ( [ eqn : trueform ] ) .",
    "that is , even though the adopted orbits are circular and edge - on , i allow for free fits to the eccentricity and inclination , and so for correlations between these parameters ( as well as the two remaining kepler parameters ) and the parameters of interest ( amplitude and period ) .",
    "the effect of allowing for these covariances is to increase the errors in semi - amplitude and period by modest amounts relative to what would be obtained using equation ( [ eqn : trueform ] ) .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ fig : apm ] show the ratios of the true errors for the amplitude and period , respectively , relative to the naive equations  ( [ eqn : massfrac ] ) and ( [ eqn : periodfrac ] ) , for both the rv ( _ green _ ) and astrometric ( _ red _ ) cases .",
    "in fact , as i will discuss in ",
    "[ sec : phase ] , for @xmath38 , the errors depends on phase as well as period .",
    "figure [ fig : apm ] therefore shows the root - mean - square of the errors , averaged over all phases .",
    "note that the rv amplitude errors follow the naive form until @xmath39 and then deteriorate relatively gracefully .",
    "by contrast , the astrometric errors begin deviating at @xmath40 and then deteriorate much more quickly . for the period errors ,",
    "deterioration begins at @xmath41 for rv and @xmath42 for astrometry , but the overall pattern is qualitatively similar .    the mass estimates for astrometry and rv depend on different combinations of amplitude and period , @xmath43 hence the fractional error in the mass ( or @xmath10 in the case of rv ) is related to the errors in the fit parameters by @xmath44 ^ 2 =   { c_{11}\\over a_1 ^ 2 } + 2n{c_{12}\\over a_1 a_2 } + n^2{c_{22}\\over a_2 ^ 2}. \\label{eqn : masscovar}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath32 , @xmath45 , but for @xmath38 , the period error and the correlations become important .",
    "figure [ fig : apm]c shows the results of calculations that apply equation ( [ eqn : masscovar ] ) .",
    "of course , the star may have more than one companion ( planetary or otherwise ) , and one may imagine arbitrarily complicated configurations . here",
    "i restrict myself to the next level of complication , a second companion that is sufficiently far away that its effect on the star may be treated as uniform acceleration . even if no such acceleration is identified",
    ", one might decide to fit for it on the grounds that there _ may _ be such a companion that has not been recognized .",
    "i now ask how the inclusion of such an additional nuisance parameter affects the precision of the physical parameters for the planet that was previously treated as isolated .",
    "the number of nuisance parameters is incremented by one in each case . referring to equation ( [ eqn : trueform ] ) , for rv , we now have @xmath21 , with @xmath23 being the systemic acceleration , while for astrometry , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the systemic proper - motion acceleration . figures [ fig : apm]a and [ fig : apm]b show the corresponding ratios relative to the naive equations ( [ eqn : massfrac ] ) and ( [ eqn : periodfrac ] ) . in this case",
    ", rv is represented by the _ red curve _ , while astrometry is represented by the _ blue curve_. the fractional mass errors are shown by _",
    "solid curves _ in figure [ fig : apm]c .    in this case , both deteriorate rapidly , but the mass - error deterioration begins at @xmath42 for astrometry and at @xmath40 for rv",
    ". one may anticipate that in other , yet more complicated situations , rv will always perform like the naive equations to higher @xmath48 than astrometry , simply because it has one fewer nuisance parameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : apm ] shows the root - mean - square errors averaged over phase . in fact , as @xmath48 grows and the rms errors deteriorate , the variations with phase also increase .",
    "figure  [ fig : phase ] shows the phase variations of the mass errors for the particular case that the period is exactly equal to the duration of the experiment , @xmath49 .",
    "these large variations imply that figure  [ fig : apm ] can not be used to estimate the errors in any particular case ( except if the rms ratio is close to unity ) .",
    "rather , it should be used as a general guide to the reliability of the experiment .",
    "any individual planet detection must be analyzed based on the actual data and the parameters derived .",
    "the results derived here are primarily of interest in regard to future astrometric missions such as gaia and sim .",
    "the first point is that planets with periods that are even slightly longer than the mission can not be reliably detected unless they are many times more massive than the nominal thresholds of detection . and",
    "second , if one is forced to allow for uniform acceleration , then the same statement applies to @xmath50 .",
    "hence , to preserve the discovery space at the longest accessible periods , it is critically important to identify or rule out distant perturbers by supplementary data , such as longer - term rv observations to look for large , distant planetary or stellar companions , or perhaps ao observations to find stellar companions .",
    "this should be relatively straightforward for sim , with its limited number of high - precision targets , but may be more difficult for gaia , which is a survey instrument ."
