    "in the search for terrestrial planetary systems around other stars , white dwarfs offer a unique astrophysical advantage . owing to high surface gravities and the onset of convection ,",
    "any atmospheric metals sink rapidly as these earth - sized stellar embers cool below 25000k , leaving behind only h or he in the outermost layers of the star @xcite , a physical process corroborated by observation @xcite . those stars with rocky planetary system remnants can become contaminated by the accretion of small , but spectroscopically detectable , amounts of heavy elements .",
    "metal lines in cool white dwarfs are a telltale of external pollution that typically implies either ongoing metal accretion rates @xmath0gs@xmath1 @xcite , or asteroid - sized masses of heavy elements within the convection zone of the star @xcite .    to date , metal - rich dust and gas disks @xcite , very likely produced by the tidal disruption of large asteroids @xcite , have been found closely orbiting more than one dozen cool white dwarfs @xcite and provide a ready explanation for the metal absorption features seen in their atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar material being gradually accreted by the white dwarf can be directly observed in the stellar photosphere to reveal its elemental abundances @xcite . while transit spectroscopy of main - sequence stars offers",

    "this letter reports the detection of circumstellar dust at the white dwarf gd61 , a he - rich star whose atmosphere is highly polluted with o , si and mg , and to a lesser degree by fe and ca . with the exception of mg detected in this work ,",
    "these photospheric heavy elements were identified previously via far - ultraviolet @xcite and optical @xcite spectroscopy , but interpreted as products of convective dredge - up and interstellar accretion .",
    "the analysis here re - interprets these elements as the result of infall from closely orbiting circumstellar debris that was once contained in a sizable planetary body such as a large asteroid .",

    "@xcite , and consistent with closely orbiting debris resulting from the tidal destruction of a planetary body such as a large asteroid .",
    "gd61 was observed using the high - resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ; @xcite ) at the keck i telescope on mauna kea .",
    "spectra covering @xmath39  ( with gaps at @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) were acquired on 2008 february 13 , and the @xmath42 data were reduced and analyzed following @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig2 ] displays a few important sections of the spectrum .",
    "element abundances were derived from comparisons of equivalent widths in the data with those of stellar atmosphere models , with upper limits established from the absence of model - predicted features . the average ca abundance was weighted by feature strength , giving most weight to the well - studied h & k resonance lines . for mg and si",
    ", the abundances for the sets of lines were combined in a direct average .",
    "the uncertainties have been calculated in a manner similar to that described in @xcite , by varying the model temperature and surface gravity by @xmath43k and @xmath44dex , respectively .",
    "prior observations of gd61 with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ were obtained and analyzed in detail by @xcite . in order of decreasing abundance , these data reveal trace amounts of h , o , si , and fe in the he - dominated atmosphere of the white dwarf . modeled stellar parameters found by @xcite",
    "are listed in table [ tbl1 ] and were found to fit the he lines in the hires spectrum of gd61 quite well overall .",
    "furthermore , these parameters are consistent with the ultraviolet through infrared photometric energy distribution of the star shown in figure [ fig1 ] , and were adopted for all purposes in this work , including the determination of metal abundances and upper limits from the hires dataset .",
    "only si is detected in both the _ fuse _ and hires datasets , and the independent analyses agree rather well , as shown in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "also , the upper limit fe abundance determined from the hires spectrum is consistent with its reported _ fuse _ detection . in order to preserve the metal - to - metal ratios found for each spectrum independently ,",
    "all heavy element ratios were tied to the weighted average of the _ fuse _ and hires si abundances .",
    "table [ tbl2 ] lists the hires , _ fuse _ , and adopted heavy element abundances relative to he , while carrying the errors distinct to each dataset .",
    "rather notably , o is the most abundant heavy element in gd61 , whereas only a strict upper limit for c could be determined from the ultraviolet data .",
    "lacking information on its circumstellar environment , @xcite had to invoke convective dredge - up combined with a highly unusual chemical profile of the white dwarf core to account for the extreme o / c @xmath45 found in gd61 .",
    "however , all white dwarfs suspected of harboring dredged - up core material exhibit atmospheric c and effective temperatures near or below 12000k @xcite , including the recently detected class of o - rich white dwarfs @xcite . at 17300k , the depth of the convective envelope in gd61 is only 2.5% of the maximum depth attained in he atmosphere white dwarfs @xcite , which occurs between 12000 and 10000k @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dredge - up can not account for detectable amounts of si , ca , and fe in the atmosphere of a white dwarf , and @xcite concluded that gd61 must have accreted these metals from the interstellar medium .",
    "however , they did not consider that metals are locked up in dust grains within the interstellar medium , and this dust is composed of o - rich silicates @xcite .",
    "such material provides a natural source for the observed o if interstellar silicates were accreted .",
    "the warm dust orbiting metal - rich white dwarfs and mature stars in general is rich in silicate minerals @xcite , and hence a large deposition of si and o should result from the accretion of this debris , in excellent qualitative agreement with the polluted atmosphere of gd61 .",
    "accretion from the closely orbiting dust disk must be ongoing due to viscous dissipation ; primarily gas drag at the inner disk edge where dust grains rapidly sublimate @xcite .",
    "material found orbiting within 20 stellar radii demonstrates that the white dwarf is currently accreting from this reservoir and provides a natural explanation for all the photospheric heavy elements , including o.",

    "these elements reside in the @xmath75 g stellar convection zone , where they are thoroughly mixed and have sinking timescales on the order of @xmath76yr @xcite .",
    "table [ tbl2 ] lists the current ( early phase ) abundances and masses of each heavy element detected in the star , as well as upper limits established from the hires and _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "based on these values , and because metals continually sink below the photosphere , the destroyed planetary body had a _ minimum _",
    "mass of @xmath77 g , roughly equivalent to an asteroid 110 km in diameter .",
    "if the disk age is less than around 10@xmath78yr ( @xmath79 ) , then insufficient time has passed for any metal to substantially diffuse below the photosphere .",
    "observable signatures of the element ratios and the total accreted mass of the disrupted asteroid are preserved in the star during this early phase of accretion . on the other hand ,",
    "if the disk age approaches or exceeds several @xmath80 , a steady state balance between accretion and diffusion is achieved for each heavy element @xcite . in either case , the abundance ratios and minimum element masses in the minor planet can be derived analytically , without knowing the exact age of the disk , and are listed in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "both the early phase and steady state scenarios predict that the total mass of observed heavy elements in gd61 is dominated by o. if all the mg , si , ca , and fe were originally contained in mgo , sio@xmath81 , cao , and feo , as in chondrites and the rocky material of the inner solar system , the nominal _ fuse _ and hires abundances indicate a significant o excess . table [ tbl3 ] explores the fraction of o contained in these metal oxides , together with upper limit and chondritic al delivered as al@xmath81o@xmath82 . even in the case where al is present at its upper limit abundance as determined by hires",
    ", there is a nominal excess mass of o by 22% or 44% in the steady state or early phases , respectively .",
    "however , at the minimum values of o / mg and o / si permitted by the errors , the o can be accounted for completely by dry mineral oxides , and thus an excess can not be confirmed with confidence using the present data .",
    "the potential for excess o in gd61 is of interest because the most natural explanation would be that extra o was originally bound in water ice representing a significant fraction of the total mass of the minor planet ; 25% to 35% in the steady state .",
    "it is possible for water to survive the post - main sequence evolution of the star , if sufficiently buried within its parent body @xcite . upon shattering during a close approach with a white dwarf , any water ice ( and volatiles )",
    "would rapidly sublimate but eventually fall onto the star ",
    "the feeble luminosity of white dwarfs is insufficient to remove even light gases by radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "if the system is still in an early phase of accretion , the potential for water is enhanced , as the implied o abundance of the accreted material is then at its highest . given that disks at white dwarfs appear to be long - lived  and in this way potentially analogous to planetary rings in the solar system  with lifetimes possibly exceeding @xmath83yr @xcite , the chance of catching the star in the early phase is small .",
    "regardless , the primary source of uncertainty for a water - rich accretion event at gd61 is the abundance errors on o , mg , and si .",
    "gd61 is polluted by material that is deficient in fe relative to both mg and si .",
    "chondritic and solar ratios among these elements are near unity ; fe / mg @xmath84 , fe / si @xmath85 @xcite . these same ratios in gd61 are 0.08 , 0.13 in the early phase , and 0.18 , 0.23 in the steady state , respectively . in either case ,",
    "the accreted material was depleted in fe relative to the material of the inner solar system .",
    "if the remnant planetary system at gd61 formed at roughly chondritic element ratios , then some process must have depleted fe from the parent body that now exists as a circumstellar ring of debris .",
    "exactly such an occurrence is the favored hypothesis for the origin of the moon . near the end of terrestrial planet formation , a mars - sized body impacted the earth , ejecting the mantle of the impactor while the cores of the two bodies liquified and fused @xcite .",
    "if the event happened sufficiently late that both bodies were largely differentiated , the ejected mantle would be relatively fe - poor , giving rise to the observed deficiency in the moon .",
    "it is unknown if extrasolar terrestrial bodies form at chondritic compositions or if significant variations exist .",
    "studying destroyed rocky planetary bodies at white dwarfs will help shed light on this important and interesting question .",
    "it is conceivable that the minor ( or major ) planet that gave rise to the metals in gd61 was formed with a distinctly non - solar fe abundance .",

    "the present uncertainties in the o / mg and o / si ratios in gd61 permit an interpretation where the accretion of water is not required to account for its o - rich atmosphere . in order to reduce these errors ,",
    "a spectrum containing all the table [ tbl2 ] detected elements is needed , whereby metal abundances can be tied to o ( rather than he ) and a confident assessment of its oxide contribution can be made .",
    "if the excess o can be confirmed with better data , the accretion of a water - rich asteroid is the most natural explanation for the circumstellar debris detected by _",
    "spitzer _ and the pattern of elements in the disk - polluted star . if all the trace h in gd61 was delivered by a single asteroid that has polluted the star for many diffusion timescales ( metals",

    "if such a minor planet were 25% to 35% water by mass as inferred from the steady state analysis and nominal o abundance , then its total mass would be 1.4 to @xmath88 g and approaching that of vesta , the second most massive asteroid in the solar system .",
    "such a large mass of orbiting material is permitted by the optically thick disk model shown in figure [ fig1 ] @xcite , while the steady state scenario implies a comparable mass has already been accreted by the star .",

    "a total age of 0.6gyr is inferred from its main - sequence lifetime plus cooling age @xcite .",
    "thus , the debris orbiting gd61 is material associated with a rocky planetary system formed about a relatively young , intermediate - mass star .",
    "recently , significant amounts of water have potentially been identified in the asteroid belt of the solar system , via main belt comet activity @xcite and surface water on themis @xcite .",
    "these discoveries have important implications for the delivery of water to a dry earth , a task that appears most readily accomplished by primordial asteroids ",
    "planetary embryos analogous to ceres  in the outer main belt @xcite .",
    "ceres itself is thought to harbor significant water ice in its interior ; its density and dynamical modeling suggest a fraction of 25% water by mass @xcite .",
    "the white dwarf gd61 is surrounded by a ring of dust , and the totality of its atmospheric pollution can be understood as the tidal destruction of a parent body similar in mass to vesta .",
    "if confirmed , the potential o excess would suggest a water content analogous to ceres .",
    "these two largest solar system asteroids are ( just ) massive enough to be differentiated , and the metals in gd61 suggest its circumstellar debris may have originated in a similarly massive , rocky exoplanetary body .",
