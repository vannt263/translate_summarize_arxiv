    "to the best of our knowledge , the concept of the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian appeared first in feshbach s papers @xcite in connection with the general theory of resonance nuclear reactions @xcite and , independently , in livic s study of open systems @xcite .",
    "a typical atomic nucleus forms near an excitation energy @xmath6 above the threshold of nucleon emission a rich set of long - lived compound states with a very dense energy spectrum .",
    "for relatively small excitation energies , these states manifest themselves as narrow isolated resonances in collisions of nucleons and target nuclei .",
    "the sharp energy dependence of the corresponding cross sections near a given resonance is described by the universal breit - wigner formula .",
    "any smoother variations can be ignored in the domain of an isolated resonance . at higher @xmath6 ,",
    "the resonance states begin to overlap and strongly interfere .",
    "nevertheless , one can still neglect the smooth energy dependence within a group of close interfering resonances . in this approximation ,",
    "the propagation of the unstable system created on the intermediate stage of the collision is characterized by the resolvent of an energy - independent non - hermitian matrix @xcite .",
    "the latter describes in the time picture the irreversible evolution of the excited intermediate state and can therefore be interpreted as the effective hamiltonian @xmath1 whose anti - hermitian part , originating from on - shell self - energy contributions , is responsible for decays into open channels .",
    "the complex eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian determine the energies and widths of the resonances .",
    "the method of the effective hamiltonian proved to be a success for describing many important resonance phenomena , especially in the context of chaotic scattering @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that , similar to the breit - wigner formula , the notion of the effective hamiltonian is _ local _ in energy although the general approaches @xcite work in much wider energy intervals where smooth variations become important and should already be taken into account . for the very concept of the effective hamiltonian to be consistent",
    ", the scales of resonant and smooth variations must be appreciably different .",
    "otherwise the resonance behavior of scattering amplitudes will be distorted or even completely destroyed .",
    "the smooth dependence influences the background phases as well as the parameters of the resonances situated in different energy domains .",
    "such effects can not be described by simply enlarging the dimension of the matrix of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "instead , a large energy - dependent matrix @xmath7 emerges whose simple interpretation as a time - shift operator is no longer valid .",
    "there is , generally , no one - to - one correspondence between the complex energies of resonance states on the one hand and the @xmath6-dependent eigenvalues of this large matrix on the other .    the current intensive studies , theoretical as well as experimental , of chaotic scattering of a particle by an open two - dimensional cavity ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) renewed interest in the hamiltonian approach to the resonance scattering theory and , in particular , to the concept and properties of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "although the scattering processes considered are purely potential , the theory is formulated in close analogy with the formalism developed in @xcite for nuclear collisions .",
    "the configuration space is divided into two parts , internal and external .",
    "the feshbach projection technique is employed to express the scattering matrix in the specific form that explicitly reveals the sharp resonant energy dependence while all smoother variations show up only indirectly via changes of the matrix elements .",
    "related is the problem of electromagnetic field quantization in open optical cavities @xcite .",
    "while the probability amplitudes of the physical processes are fixed unambiguously , the projection procedure exploited is not unique .",
    "there exists a rather wide freedom in choosing the surface of separation as well as the boundary conditions ( bcs ) on this surface .",
    "therefore , the amplitudes of interest are expressed in terms of quantities that depend on the details of the formalism .",
    "the independence of the final results of the calculations is not , as a rule , directly seen .",
    "therefore , a certain caution is necessary to avoid incorrect assertions .",
    "an unexpected dependence on the ( auxiliary ) boundary condition at the cavity - lead interface was found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "moreover , poor agreement with numerically calculated exact poles of the @xmath8 matrix was revealed for poles distant from the real axis .",
    "these points , partly attributed by the authors to numerical limitations , require further clarification .",
    "additional physical arguments should sometimes be involved to reasonably restrict the freedom .",
    "it is important to recognize that the density of levels in billiard - like cavities is much lower than that of the many - body nuclear systems .",
    "actually , strong overlap and interference of different resonance states are not , as a rule , possible in the single two - dimensional cavities ordinarily considered @xcite .",
    "the simple breit - wigner approximation is usually sufficient in this case for any individual resonance ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "noticeable interference can occur only in the rare event of accidental near degeneracy of resonances .",
    "experimental observation of such an interference of few resonances in an open microwave cavity has recently been reported in @xcite .",
    "stronger overlap and a non trivial effective hamiltonian matrix can , however , appear when open chains of a number of similar potential wells connected to each other are considered .",
    "the energy spectrum has a band structure in this case with much denser spectrum within a given band . a schematic model of such a kind",
    "was considered in @xcite .",
    "a similar example was also investigated in @xcite in the framework of graph theory @xcite .",
    "some general aspects of scattering in periodic structures have also been considered in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the notion of the effective hamiltonian in potential scattering .",
    "the questions we are concerned with do not depend on the regular or irregular character of the motion .",
    "thus , we restrict ourselves to the simplest case of the single - channel @xmath9-wave scattering .",
    "the extension to higher partial waves is straightforward .",

    "iii ) , _ depends _ on the bc and the radius @xmath12 of separation in the configuration space .",
    "different bcs define different representations of the internal and external parts of the ( unique ) scattering wave function .",
    "the role of the fictitious direct reflection at the separation point @xmath12 is also discussed .    in sec .  iv the exactly solvable open kronig - penney model is considered as an example of potential scattering with interfering resonances .",
    "closed expressions are found for both scattering @xmath13 and staying - wave @xmath14 functions as well as wigner s function @xmath15 .",
    "their analytical properties in the complex @xmath16 and energy planes are analyzed in detail .",
    "hereafter we compare these exact results with those obtained in the framework of the projection formalism of the previous sections .",
    "we analyze two typical choices of the bcs for the internal motion : the cases of neumann and dirichlet bcs . in the second case",
    ", the internal problem corresponds to a closed counterpart of the system under consideration that allows one to follow the changes of the motion due to the interference of resonances when the openness grows .",
    "the latter is in line with numerous applications considered in the literature .",
    "non - hermitian effective hamiltonians for a fixed band of resonance states are built up in both cases .",
    "we summarize our main findings in the concluding sec .",
    "the radial motion in the @xmath9-wave scattering is described by the schrdinger equation ( we use the units @xmath17 throughout the paper ) @xmath18 with the boundary condition @xmath19 at the origin .",
    "we use below the specific method which , basically , goes back to bloch s paper @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath49 .",
    "the interplay of the internal and external motions due to the off - diagonal elements @xmath35 , ( [ n]c ) , distorts the outer waves @xmath22 . from the upper row in eq .",

    "for such an excitation , we can neglect the potential @xmath81 whereupon the solution of the internal problem reduces simply to @xmath82 .",
    "the contribution @xmath83 to be dropped appears due to the factor @xmath84 which arises in the numerator after the double differentiation has been done .",
    "it is easy to see , that just the contribution of this kind mainly caused numerical problems in @xcite . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the sum converges , although slowly , to the finite limit ( [ lim ] ) because of oscillations @xcite .",
    "it would be a mistake to rely upon the spectral representations in ( [ r ] ) , and interpret the eigenvalues @xmath86 as energies of resonance states and the phases @xmath87 or @xmath88 as smooth phases of the background scattering .",

    "let the potential vanish identically everywhere , @xmath111 , so that the @xmath8 function @xmath112 . nevertheless , neither the operator @xmath0 nor the function @xmath113 are trivial in themselves .",

    "( [ seceq ] ) looks as @xmath124 and , therefore , has no roots in any finite domain of this plane .",
    "this implies , in turn , that eq .",
    "( [ kp ] ) has no non - trivial solutions .",
    "in fact , the function ( [ tils ] ) is simply equal to @xmath125 in this case and compensates exactly the phase shift due to the fictitious reflection at the separation point @xmath12 .",
    "the remark above is of quite a general nature .",
    "the radius of separation can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we suggest only that @xmath12 is larger than the finite radius of the potential .",
    "the actual wave function satisfies at this point the conditions @xmath126 of course , none of these quantities is known before the problem has been solved .",
    "any boundary condition used above generates a complete basis in the hilbert space , in which the actual wave functions can be expanded .",
    "all such bases are formally equivalent . but",
    "this does not mean that all of them are equally adequate from the physical point of view .",
    "in particular , the more the basis eigenvectors and their derivatives differ at the point @xmath12 from the real values ( [ actbc ] ) the more slowly the corresponding expansion converges near this point .",
    "a forced bc creates a false reflection at this point , which is described by the factor @xmath127 , whose phase should be fully compensated by the similar part of the total phase of the function @xmath128 .",
    "both factors separately depend on @xmath12 although the complete function @xmath13 does not . the main role in this compensation",
    "is played by the matrix elements @xmath129 with large @xmath130 when the influence of the potential @xmath131 becomes negligible , and we return to the situation described in the previous paragraph .    however , the choice of the separation radius and bc influences the positions of the poles ( as well as the residues ) of the function @xmath11 and , consequently , the explicit form of the matrix @xmath132 .",
    "this influence is stronger the less adequate the choice made of bc and @xmath12 . in general , the parameters of the @xmath11 function can carry rather poor information about the actual complex poles .",
    "for this reason , diagonalization of a truncated matrix @xmath132 ( which is necessary in any numerical computation ) can lead in the case of a poor choice to strong disagreement with the characteristics of the actual poles of the function @xmath8 .",
    "the explicit dependence of the matrix elements @xmath132 on the wave number @xmath16 causes additional problems ( see next section ) . to extract the physically relevant effective hamiltonian from the formal operator @xmath0 , additional physical considerations must be engaged .",
    "for example , one may expect from the physical point of view that the most relevant choice of the separation point @xmath12 would be a distance matching an outer potential barrier which is strong enough to make immediate reflection at this point quite probable .    to explore in more detail the questions briefly discussed above",
    ", we will apply in the next section the formal technique sketched here to the problem of scattering by a finite periodic set of @xmath4 barriers , which can be solved exactly .",

    "the distance @xmath135 is measured in units of the size of the well formed by two neighboring barriers .",

    "all other states are trapped in the interior region and share small portions @xmath442 ^ 2 $ ] of the collective displacement and width in accordance with the group velocity @xcite .",
    "the solution just described has formally very much in common with the schematic model of the so - called nuclear dipole giant resonance developed in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the relevance of the concept of the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian in finite - range potential scattering .",
    "single - channel @xmath9-wave resonance scattering is considered as an example .",
    "the scattering function @xmath13 is meromorphic in this case , i.e. , has only isolated poles in the complex plane of the wave numbers .",
    "the number of poles is , generally , infinite but only a finite part of them can be interpreted as resonances .",
    "we first presented ( secs .",
    "ii and iii ) a consistent self - adjoint formulation of the scattering problem , which is based on separation of the configuration space into internal and external segments . in this way",
    ", the @xmath13 function is represented in terms of a non - hermitian energy - dependent operator @xmath443 .",
    "there exists a wide freedom in choosing the radius @xmath12 of separation as well as the boundary conditions at this point .",
    "different choices yield different explicit forms of this operator together with the @xmath13 and @xmath15 functions .",
    "this can , in particular , come out strongly if one truncates the matrix @xmath0 to calculate numerically the positions of the poles of @xmath8 function in the complex @xmath16 plane .",
    "nevertheless , the true complex poles of the @xmath8 function and this function itself depend , as we explicitly demonstrate , neither on the bc nor on the radius @xmath12 .",
    "although all choices are formally allowed , this does not mean that they are equally adequate from the physical point of view .",
    "for instance , a fictitious immediate reflection takes place at the ( arbitrarily chosen ) point of separation @xmath12 .",
    "the artificial separation of the phase of this reflection results , in turn , in the appearance of an infinite number of remote poles of the function @xmath15 , which describe the smooth contribution from the interior region @xmath444 .",
    "the phase of the immediate reflection must be compensated by the contributions of such poles for the radius @xmath12 to disappear finally from the scattering amplitude .",
    "this can cause unjustified complications in intermediate stages of calculations .",
    "we argue that the harm is minimized if the separation radius matches an outer potential barrier when it is strong enough to make immediate reflection at this point quite probable .",
    "the notion of the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian first introduced in the theory of resonance nuclear reactions emerges when a group of very close resonance states strongly overlap and interfere .",
    "we stress that , in contrast to the nuclear reactions , in the cases of the potential resonance scattering usually discussed in the literature the density of the energy spectrum is too low and the ordinary breit - wigner approximation of isolated resonances usually suffices .",
    "the complex energy of the @xmath334th resonance which dominates in the scattering amplitudes near the scattering energy @xmath445 .",
    "there is no room for an effective hamiltonian in this case or , more strictly , it is embodied by the @xmath446 `` matrix '' @xmath447 .",
    "we emphasize that the energy dependent operator @xmath443 should not be confused with the effective hamiltonian .",
    "energy dependent eigenvalues of this operator are not , generally , in one - to - one correspondence with the complex energies of the actual resonance states",
    ".    overlap and interference of the resonances can become possible in the cases when the energy spectrum has a band structure . as an example of this kind we investigate a periodically disposed chain of a finite number @xmath2 of radial @xmath4 barriers .",
    "all @xmath8 , @xmath234 and @xmath11 functions are found in closed forms in terms of an @xmath3 @xmath16-dependent matrix propagator .",
    "this allows us to study in detail all analytical properties in the complex @xmath16 plane and to verify the correspondence with the projection formalism used .",
    "there exist a finite number of separated bands of close resonances . within the @xmath334th band which lie near the scattering energy @xmath448 one can neglect all smooth variations with @xmath16 . in this approximation ,",
    "the mentioned propagator proved to coincide with the resolvent of the @xmath3 block @xmath449 of the matrix @xmath450 _ taken at the fixed value _",
    "just this matrix plays the role of the effective hamiltonian of the system in the energy interval within the band .",
    "different choices of bcs yield different patterns of the resonance interference . in particular , the spectrum of the poles of the @xmath11 function is exactly reproduced in the framework of the projection technique with the bc ( [ cnint ] ) of neumann type fixed at the position @xmath196 of the outer barrier .",
    "the corresponding energy levels depend on the penetrability constant @xmath387 of the outer barrier .",
    "shifts of the levels due to the coupling to the continuum are included in this case from the very beginning .",
    "utilization of the dirichlet bc for the intrinsic motion gives another but yet equivalent formulation of the scattering problem considered .",
    "the internal problem in this case fixes a closed counterpart of the open system under consideration .",
    "this enables us to investigate the change of the regime of the internal motion of the system as its openness grows .",
    "the interaction via the continuum shifts the original @xmath387-independent levels of the internal motion along both real and imaginary axes .",
    "a transition is explicitly demonstrated from the bunch of @xmath2 similar narrow resonances to the formation of a relatively broad resonance strongly shifted with respect to the band , which exists in the outer well .",
    "the other resonances turn out to be trapped in the inner part of the system .",
    "this is quite similar to the results of earlier investigations which rely upon the notion of the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian of an open system .",
