    "the experimental success of the @xmath0 standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak forces can be considered as the triumph of the gauge symmetry principle to describe particle interactions .",
    "as we now briefly summarize , there are many different facts which have to be taken into account when searching for a deeper underlying theory , and these are :      the major success of the sm is that it accounts for essentially all present accelerator results . in particular :    * the most accurately known quantity in particle physics is the magnetic moment of the electron , with its ` anomalous ' part being @xmath1 , i.e. the normalized difference in the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath2 with respect to the classical dirac value @xmath3 ( where the magnetic moment @xmath4 is related to the particle spin @xmath5 through @xmath6 ) .",
    "the experimental and theoretical values are respectively @xcite @xmath7 + the theoretical expression results from the computation of the loop corrections within the sm up to order @xmath8 , including diagrams such as those depicted in figure  1 .",
    "the one loop photon correction is the well known schwinger term .",
    "its prediction was actually one of the first major successes of qed , proving that radiative corrections could be made meaningful through renormalization and were indeed measurable .",
    "higher order contributions include terms such as that involving the photon self energy in diagram ( 1.c ) and the photon ",
    "photon scattering appearing in diagram ( 1.d ) .",
    "these two are actually the major sources of uncertainties for the magnetic moments of heavier leptons ( @xmath4 or @xmath9 ) , but for the electron the theoretical error is actually dominated by the uncertainty in the direct measurement of @xmath10 using the quantum hall effect .",
    "indeed , one may use the theoretical expression for @xmath11 ( as a fourth order polynomial in @xmath10 ) to infer a ` theoretically based ' value for the electromagnetic coupling , which has a smaller error than the one obtained from direct measurements , and is @xmath12 .",
    "this of course is the value at low energies , and running it to the scale of the @xmath13 boson , where for instance lep measurements are done , one gets in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath14 ) scheme @xmath15 where @xmath16 encodes the effects of the radiative corrections .",
    "+    * the weak interactions are based on the spontaneous breaking @xmath17 ( with associated coupling constants @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively ) induced by the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of the higgs doublet field @xmath21  gev .",
    "assuming that the left handed fermions belong to su(2 ) doublets while the right handed chiralities to su(2 ) singlets ensures that the charge current couplings of the @xmath22 boson violate parity maximally , and this gives rise to the well established @xmath23 theory . at low energies , @xmath22-boson mediated processes have an effective coupling with strength given by the fermi constant , @xmath24 , and the measured muon lifetime leads to the value @xmath25  gev@xmath26 . regarding the neutral currents ,",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath13 bosons are obtained rotating by an angle @xmath28 the neutral su(2 ) gauge boson @xmath29 and the @xmath30 boson @xmath31 , i.e. and @xmath32 . ]",
    "@xmath33 the photon is the gauge boson associated to the unbroken @xmath34 ( and hence remains massless ) provided that @xmath35 and its coupling to fermions is vectorial , having strength @xmath36 and being proportional to the fermion charge @xmath37 .",
    "regarding the fermion couplings to the @xmath13 boson , they can be written as ( @xmath38 , with the vectorial part being @xmath39 and the axial vector piece being @xmath40 .",
    "the resonant production of @xmath13 bosons at lepi allowed to test these couplings and to accurately measure the @xmath13 boson mass from the observed line - shape , resulting in @xmath41  gev .",
    "one can also obtain directly the masses of the gauge bosons from the spontaneously broken electroweak lagrangian and one obtains the relation @xmath42 .",
    "clearly this relation and eq .",
    "( [ tgw ] ) can not both hold at the loop level , since the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ tgw ] ) run and are hence scale dependent .",
    "this leads to different definitions for the weak mixing angle , with the on - shell value being @xmath43 while the ( scale dependent ) @xmath14 one being @xmath44 with fits to electroweak observables leading to @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath14 definition of the mixing angle is the most appropriate one for the study of the running of gauge couplings , and in particular to confront unification predictions . combining the large amount of electroweak observables , including lepi z resonance cross sections , widths and asymmetries , tevatron and lepii w - boson mass measurements , and also neutrino scattering processes",
    ", one can test the effects of radiative corrections , which are sensitive to the virtual effects of the top quark and higgs boson . from these one obtains favored ranges for the top and higgs masses , which are @xmath46  gev and @xmath47  gev @xcite , in remarkable agreement with the top mass measured at the tevatron , @xmath48  gev , and suggesting the presence of a light higgs boson .",
    "hence , one can say that also the electroweak sector has been tested at the loop level . * the strong interactions",
    "are described by quantum chromo dynamics , i.e. by the unbroken non - abelian gauge theory su(3 ) . due to the gluon s self interactions it has the property of being asymptotically free , while at low energies",
    "the coupling constant becomes large and the theory should then account for the confinement of quarks into colorless hadrons .",
    "the running of the strong coupling has been tested extracting @xmath49 from experiments performed at different energies , such as the measured @xmath9 lepton widths , deep inelastic scattering , upsilon decays and @xmath50 colliders at different center of mass energies and up to @xmath51  gev .",
    "in particular , one has @xmath52 .",
    "* besides the gauge sector , a crucial ingredient of the sm is the family structure .",
    "the first generation of fermions consists of @xmath53 and this pattern is replicated two more times to lead to the three fermion families .",
    "this number of three is nicely consistent with the number of massless neutrinos coupling to the z - boson inferred from the invisible z width , @xmath54 , and also with the possibility of having cp violation in the quark sector through a non - trivial phase in the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa matrix @xmath55 .",
    "the ckm phase can account for the cp violating effects observed in the kaon system ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) or b system ( time dependent asymmetries in @xmath58 ) .",
    "+ the two quark states contained in the doublet @xmath59 are directly coupled among them through a w boson , and hence constitute the so - called flavor eigenstates .",
    "the mass eigenstate quarks are instead in general a mixture of flavor eigenstates belonging to different families . adopting for convenience the up type ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) flavor eigenstates to coincide with the corresponding mass eigenstates , the down type mass eigenstates ( @xmath62 ) )",
    "are just related to the flavor eigenstates through the ckm matrix , i.e. @xmath63 the unitarity of this matrix , which is ultimately due to the family structure of the model , ensures that the couplings of the z - boson to the down type mass eigenstates is also flavor diagonal , since they turn out to be proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "this is the basis of the glashow illiopoulos and maiani ( gim ) mechanism @xcite , which forbids tree level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and supresses the loop mediated ones , which are non - zero only due to the mass differences between different quarks .",
    "this naturally accounts for the smallness of e.g. the @xmath65 decay @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 ) or the @xmath68 neutral kaon mass difference ( @xmath69 ) , as illustrated in figure  [ gim ] .",
    "the value of @xmath70 actually provided the first indication of the correct mass for the charm quark @xcite , so that as in the previously mentioned example of the top mass , it is important to keep in mind that in these two cases virtual processes were sensitive to the effects of particles prior to their direct production at accelerators .",
    "one should then not be too skeptical when looking for virtual effects as a way to discover new particles predicted in extensions of the sm ( e.g. supersymmetric or gut ones ) . +    and contributions to the @xmath68 neutral kaon mass difference . ]",
    "+ due to the large hierarchy @xmath71 , in the flavor changing processes involving the @xmath72 quark , such as @xmath73 , the gim suppression is not very effective , leading to sizeable decay rates .",
    "one has indeed @xmath74 and the reduced suppression in this process makes it also an interesting probe for new physics .",
    "together with the many good things of the sm , there are several bad aspects where it fails to provide an adequate solution .",
    "these are :    * there is by now quite solid evidence supporting the existence of non - zero neutrino masses , coming from the explanation of the atmospheric and solar neutrino problems in terms of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the sm with just left handed neutrinos and a higgs doublet is unable to provide a non - zero neutrino mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the masslessness of the neutrinos in the sm is not related to any deep symmetry principle ( unlike the masslessness of the photon which is linked to gauge invariance ) , and hence it is quite common that extensions of the sm give rise to massive neutrinos .",
    "the simplest way to get massive neutrinos would be to introduce the right - handed neutrino states @xmath75 , and obtain a dirac mass term by means of a yukawa coupling @xmath76 .",
    "however , for the resulting masses to be sufficiently small ( below the ev range ) the yukawa coupling would have to be quite small ( @xmath77 ) , and this does nt seem very natural . all other attempts to give masses to the neutrinos require to extend the sm in more radical ways . *",
    "the sm suffers from the so - called strong cp problem , which is the fact that a lorentz invariant term in the sm lagrangian of the form @xmath78 is consistent with the gauge symmetries of the model and there is hence no reason to omit it ( where @xmath79 is the dual of the gluon field strength @xmath80 ) .",
    "this term is however cp violating and induces a contribution to the neutron electric dipole moment @xmath81e  cm .",
    "the experimental upper bounds on @xmath82 require then that @xmath83 , and the smallness of this parameter has no natural explanation within the sm .",
    "one possibility is to extend the higgs sector and introduce an axial global u(1 ) symmetry , the so - called peccei quinn symmetry @xcite , which gets broken spontaneously leading to the appearance of a pseudo - goldstone boson , the axion .",
    "the anomaly in the @xmath84 leads to the axion coupling to @xmath85 , and the same dynamics of the theory has the effect of producing a cancellation in the total contribution to @xmath82 . *",
    "an important theoretical difficulty of the sm is the hierarchy problem , related to the fact that loop corrections to the scalar ( higgs ) masses are quadratically divergent , and hence in a regularized theory with an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath86 one gets contributions at one loop @xmath87 , with the different contributions ( see figure  [ natural ] ) being proportional to @xmath88 ( the higgs quartic self - coupling ) , @xmath89 ( the squared gauge coupling ) or @xmath90 ( the squared yukawa coupling , with a minus sign due to the fermionic nature of the loop ) .",
    "if one thinks of the cutoff as the scale where a more fundamental ( and less divergent ) theory enters to play a role , it would be hard to understand how things conspire to cancel the large loop correction ( if @xmath91 or @xmath92 ) , leaving a higgs mass at the tev scale .",
    "since this would require an accurate fine - tuning , the situation is usually refered to as the naturalness or fine - tuning problem . the simplest solution for this is to appeal to supersymmetry entering into the game at a relatively low scale ( @xmath93 ) and enforcing the cancellation between the dangerous quadratic divergences arising from bosonic and fermionic loops .",
    "+    * the sm provides no explanation for the origin of the baryon asymmetry , i.e. the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe .",
    "even if there are baryogenesis scenarios exploiting the non perturbative sm baryon number violation , in order for them to be successful new sources of cp violation and extended higgs sectors are generally required . *",
    "the sm has no good candidate for the dark matter which is inferred to contribute sizeably to the overall matter in the universe .",
    "the favored cosmological model nowadays suggests indeed @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and neither a cold dark matter particle nor an explanation for the origin of a cosmological constant @xmath86 of the required size can be found within the sm .",
    "cosmological theories of primordial inflation also require to search for their causes beyond the sm . *",
    "an even more serious drawback is that the sm makes no attempt to include a consistent quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the search for a good theory to describe particle interactions has also an esthetical component , and in physics beauty is generally related to simplicity and to the fact that important things should not happen by chance , but should instead result from solid underlying reasons .",
    "some of the ugly things in the sm are :    * the model has many unrelated parameters .",
    "these include the three coupling constants @xmath96 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the yukawa couplings , or equivalently three charged lepton masses , 6 quark masses , three ckm mixing angles and one cp violating phase . in the higgs sector",
    "there is the higgs quartic coupling and the higgs vev ( or equivalently @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) .",
    "there is also the qcd parameter @xmath99 .",
    "this makes a total of 19 independent parameters .",
    "this number is further increased if we take into account the neutrino masses and leptonic mixings .",
    "clearly a theory relating the gauge couplings ( unification ) or explaining the pattern of fermion mixings would be most welcome .",
    "* the gauge group @xmath0 was just put in by hand to explain observations , but there is no deep principle behind that choice . * assigning left - handed chiralities to su(2 ) doublets and right - handed ones to singlets is again arbitrary . left right symmetric models",
    "are believed to be more esthetic . *",
    "the number of generations @xmath100 is also unexplained . *",
    "the quantization of electric charge , i.e. the fact that @xmath101 , is unexplained . *",
    "the cancellation of gauge anomalies in the sm happens just by chance .",
    "let us now further comment into the anomaly issue .",
    "anomalies occur when a classical symmetry of the lagrangian is violated by quantum effects . a traditional example being the dilatation symmetry of a massless ( i.e. scale free ) theory , which gets broken at the quantum level due to the need to introduce the renormalization scale .",
    "this leads to a non - vanishing trace of the energy momentum tensor , which constitutes the so - called trace anomaly .",
    "another example are the chiral symmetries , i.e. a symmetry under transformations distinguishing between left and right fermion chiralities , @xmath102 for a massless theory this is a good symmetry , and hence the associated noether current @xmath103 is conserved .",
    "however , computing the one loop contribution arising from the triangle diagrams involving one axial vector and two vector couplings ( and contracting this with the momentum incoming in the axial vector vertex , so as to get the fourier version of the divergence of the current ) , one gets @xmath104 with @xmath105 the field strength of the field coupling to the vector - like vertex .",
    "for the non - abelian case the resulting anomaly is proportional ( as can be seen from figure  [ dabc ] ) to the symmetric structure constants @xmath106/2 $ ] , where @xmath107 are the generators in the representation of the fermions running in the loop .",
    "when the chiral symmetry in question is a global one , anomalies pose no problems , and may even be a blessing .",
    "this is the case for instance in massless qcd , where taking the limit @xmath108 the theory acquires an @xmath109 global symmetry , corresponding to separate unitary rotations of the left and right quark fields @xmath110 .",
    "this symmetry can be decomposed as @xmath111 . within qcd ,",
    "the vectorial parts remain good symmetries , and are reflected in the baryon multiplet degeneracies and in the baryon number conservation respectively , while @xmath112 is spontaneously broken by the qcd chiral condensate , what is reflected in the appearance of goldstone bosons which are just the meson octet .",
    "this chiral symmetry is anomalous and the anomaly is responsible for instance for the dominant @xmath113 decay ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the @xmath115 symmetry is also anomalous , and this anomaly ( combined with the non - trivial structure of the qcd vacuum ) is responsible for giving a sufficiently large mass to the @xmath116 meson .",
    "when considering the electroweak interactions , since both @xmath117 and @xmath30 are chiral gauge groups , i.e. have different couplings to left and right fermions , also the global vectorial symmetries of baryon and lepton number become anomalous , with @xmath118 , \\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the number of flavors while @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the corresponding field strengths .",
    "this anomaly implies that when topology changes in the gauge fields occur , baryon and lepton numbers will change by an amount @xmath122 , where the chern simons number @xmath123 characterizes the amount of ` winding ' of the gauge fields .",
    "these transitions are however very suppressed at low energies / temperatures , since they are mediated by instantons , but become however very efficient at high temperatures , where they take place through ` sphaleron ' excitations , and this has profound implications for baryogenesis theories .",
    "although global anomalies are welcome , when an anomaly affects a gauge symmetry this can be a disaster , since the gauge symmetry principle is at the basis of the formulation of the theory and is essential for its renormalizability .",
    "hence , if the gauge symmetry ceases to be valid at the loop level one will certainly be in trouble . due to the chiral anomaly , this will in general be the case for a chiral gauge theory , such as the one present in the electroweak model , so that the renormalizability of the sm is threatened .",
    "however , it turns out that when one adds the contributions to the anomaly coming from the leptons and from the @xmath124 colors of quarks running in the triangle diagram , one has luckily a fortuitous cancellation , since @xmath125 for instance , the @xmath126 contribution is proportional to ( using @xmath127 , @xmath128 and tr@xmath129 ) @xmath130={\\delta_{ab}\\over 2}\\sum_i q_i\\propto [ q_e+3(q_d+q_u)]=0.\\ ] ] it is clear then that the sm with quarks or leptons alone would be anomalous , and to get a consistent electroweak theory we need to have both of them simultaneously . a theory in which anomalies are absent independently of the choice of matter representation ( such as @xmath131 guts ) , would not have this item in the list of ugly things .",
    "many of the major advances in physics have resulted from the unified description of aspects which were before believed to be unrelated .",
    "this is also an important guide in the search of the underlying theory behind the sm , trying to remedy its pitfalls without loosing its successes .",
    "a schematic history of these unifications is illustrated in table  1 , and we will discuss hereafter some aspects of unification and supersymmetry ( but not deal however with other also fundamental ideas such as extra dimensions or strings ) .",

    "the idea in grand unified theories ( guts ) is to embed the sm group @xmath0 in a larger group , with the aim of relating the different gauge couplings and also hoping that the mass spectrum will become simpler , since the quarks and leptons become different aspects of the same gut ` particle ' .",
    "the most famous examples of unified groups are    * the pati ",
    "salam model @xcite was the first gut theory proposed ( 1972 ) .",
    "it was based on the @xmath133 symmetry , with the leptons being some kind of fourth quark flavor and each family consisting of the representations @xmath134 putting quarks and leptons in the same @xmath135 multiplets lead to proton decay processes , and the left - right symmetry required the introduction of right handed neutrinos in each generation .",
    "although each group factor has an associated gauge coupling , relations among them can be imposed invoking discrete symmetries . *",
    "the smallest ( i.e. @xmath136 ) simple gauge group containing the sm is @xmath137 , and it was studied by georgi and glashow in 1974 @xcite .",
    "each generation is contained in two @xmath137 irreducible representations , which are rather than the right handed fields @xmath138 , and they clearly describe the same degrees of freedom , since @xmath139 . ] @xmath140 * the orthogonal group @xmath131 is the next choice .",
    "it has @xmath141 and can contain the previously mentioned gut groups .",
    "the fermions of each generation are contained in just one irreducible representation , the @xmath142 , which can be decomposed under @xmath137 as @xmath143 , with the singlet state being the right handed neutrino . +",
    "another attractive aspect of so(10 ) is that orthogonal groups are automatically anomaly free , since their symmetric structure constants @xmath144 vanish .",
    "this is not the case in su(5 ) , where one still needs the fortuitous cancellation between the non - vanishing anomalies coming from the @xmath145 and the @xmath146 , which just happen to be opposite .",
    "* other larger groups which have been intensively studied are : the exceptional group @xmath147 ( with fermions in the @xmath148 , which under @xmath131 decomposes as @xmath149 , so that many exotic states appear in each generation ) ; the string inspired groups @xmath150 ( with @xmath147 being contained in one of the @xmath151 factors ) and @xmath152 .",
    "large symmetry breaking chains are required to go from these large groups down to the sm , and many new heavy particles are left around when doing so ( heavy higgses , new fermions , new gauge bosons such as @xmath153 or @xmath154 ones ) , and these are the object of many dedicated searches at accelerators .      in the sm the three gauge couplings are different and unrelated , i.e. @xmath155 . moreover , the actual value of @xmath19 is related to the arbitrary normalization of the hypercharge generator .",
    "indeed , consider the covariant derivative in the electroweak model , which is @xmath156 the gauge fields are clearly normalized through their kinetic terms , while the @xmath157 generators are normalized through the non - linear condition @xmath158 and this fixes the normalization of the coupling @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath30 coupling @xmath19 is arbitrarily fixed by adopting the hypercharge normalization from the relation @xmath159 . in an unified gauge group where all generators are similarly normalized",
    ", the hypercharge generator will turn out to have a different normalization than in the sm , and this modifies the expected relation between the gut coupling @xmath160 and @xmath19 .",
    "take for instance the case of @xmath137 , where in the fundamental representation the 24 generators , normalized through the relation ( [ trtatb ] ) , can be conveniently written in block form using the @xmath161 gellman matrices @xmath162 and @xmath157 pauli matrices @xmath163 , as @xmath164 @xmath165 we see that @xmath166 is proportional to the hypercharge generator @xmath167 , but is now properly normalized .",
    "the covariant derivative of the unified group is obtained as @xmath168 . from this",

    "notice that the photon should be contained among the gut gauge bosons , and indeed the charge generator is just given by @xmath173 . since the generators are traceless , this implies that tr@xmath174 .",
    "considering for instance the fundamental @xmath145 representation , this implies that @xmath175 , explaining the charge quantization relation just from the fact that quarks and leptons are inside the same gut multiplets .      to obtain the running of the gauge couplings in the sm",
    "it is necessary to consider the loop corrections to the vertex and wave functions of the gauge bosons ( depicted in figure  [ vertex ] ) , or alternatively one may consider the gauge boson coupling to fermions and the fermion wave function renormalization .",
    "the result of these two approaches is of course the same , as expressed in a slavnov taylor identity reflecting the constraints imposed by the gauge symmetry .",

    "the result is plotted in figure  [ smrge ] .",
    "we see that the negative value of @xmath199 makes the strong coupling to become weaker at high energies , i.e. qcd becomes asymptotically free .",

    "we see that although the three couplings are quite different at low energies , they have the tendency to unify at a scale @xmath202@xmath203  gev .",
    "this is certainly encouraging and may be pointing to the existence of an underlying gut symmetry at large scales . however ,",
    "within the sm the convergence of the gauge couplings at one scale is not perfect ( and this is not solved by including two loop contributions nor threshold effects ) , so that something more will be required to get an accurate unification of the couplings at a unique scale .",
    "another important issue that guts can address is to explain some of the observed patterns of fermion masses .",
    "let us consider for instance the case of su(5 ) in some detail .",
    "the breaking of su(5 ) down to the sm is performed by the vev of an adjoint @xmath204 higgs representation , so as to preserve the rank of the group .",
    "one has then @xmath205 .",
    "since the sm fermions can acquire mass only through the bilinears @xmath206 it is clear that one can not make a singlet by contracting these fermion bilinears with the @xmath204 .",
    "hence , sm fermions do not acquire masses in the su(5 ) breaking stage ( what is fortunate of course , since they would be otherwise too heavy ) . to give masses to both @xmath145 and @xmath146 representations with just one higgs multiplet , one has then to use either the @xmath207 or the @xmath208 representations .",
    "the minimal su(5 ) model uses just one @xmath207 of higgses @xmath209 to give fermions a mass in the process of electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath210 .",
    "this higgs representation consists of a color triplet state @xmath211 and the usual higgs doublet @xmath212 , i.e. @xmath213 . the yukawa couplings can be written as @xmath214 where @xmath215 are the fermions in the @xmath146 and @xmath216 those in @xmath145 , while @xmath217 are family indices .",
    "when @xmath207 acquires a vev breaking the electroweak symmetry , i.e. @xmath218 , one gets masses for the fermions , and those of the down quarks and leptons satisfy @xmath219 this relation would imply in particular the equality @xmath220 , which again has to be checked at the gut scale rather than at low energies . to take into account the running of fermion masses one has to evaluate the diagram in figure  [ mrun ] , which gets contributions from color and hypercharge gauge bosons in the loop ( since @xmath117 bosons can not provide the required chirality flip ) . from these one gets @xmath221        this gives at low energies ( @xmath222 ) the prediction @xmath223 , which is in rough agreement with the measured values ( we have here neglected the effects of yukawa couplings ) .",
    "this seems to be then another success of the gut idea , but when looking however to the first two generations , the same relations would imply @xmath224 and @xmath225 , which are however badly violated , since experimentally @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "one proposed solution to fix this is to include also a @xmath208 higgs representation to generate the fermion masses @xcite .",
    "this one has the property of introducing a clebsch gordan factor of 3 for the lepton mass term with respect to that of the down quarks , so that the prediction arising from the @xmath208 induced mass term alone would be @xmath228 at the gut scale .",
    "running this then down to low energies would lead to @xmath229 , as seems to be the case for the second generation .",
    "hence it would seem desirable to exploit the coupling to the @xmath207 to generate the third generation masses , while that to the @xmath208 to generate the second generation ones .",
    "furthermore , with appropriate yukawas ( with ` texture ' zeroes imposed by discrete symmetries ) one may fix the masses of the three generations . for instance , taking @xmath230 one gets , after taking into account the above mentioned clebsch , that @xmath231 this gives @xmath232 , which is good at the gut scale . for @xmath233 one",
    "has also @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "when running down to low energies one obtains the satisfactory results @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "of course the ` textured ' yukawas in eq .",
    "( [ textures ] ) were put in by hand , but the success of the predictions may be giving a hint on the kind of symmetries required to generate them .      in the sm",
    "there is no way to write renormalizable terms in the lagrangian consistent with the gauge symmetries but violating baryon number @xmath31 .",
    "hence , one has the fact that @xmath31 is an accidental symmetry ( it was not imposed by any deep fundamental reason ) of the sm lagrangian , and is only violated by the non - perturbative effects related to the anomaly mentioned before . as a consequence ,",
    "the proton turns out to be stable in the sm , since it is the lightest particle with non - zero @xmath31 .",
    "when guts are considered , we have seen that quarks and leptons reside together in large gut multiplets .",
    "this means that there will be gauge bosons connecting them , and hence violating @xmath31 and @xmath239 .",
    "for instance , of the 24 gauge bosons in the adjoint of @xmath137 there are , besides the 12 ones belonging to the sm , additional color triplet and weak doublets vector fields @xmath240 ( with @xmath241 the color index ) , which together with their antiparticles make the twelve remaining gauge bosons .",
    "they have electric charges @xmath242 and @xmath243 , and couple to the fermions through @xmath244 +    y^\\alpha_\\mu\\left[-\\bar d^c_\\alpha \\gamma^\\mu \\nu-\\bar u_\\alpha \\gamma^\\mu e^c+\\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\bar u^{c\\gamma}\\gamma^\\mu d^\\beta\\right]\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    hence , we see that @xmath245 couples as a ` leptoquark ' ( @xmath246 ) and as a ` diquark ' ( @xmath247 ) , clearly violating @xmath31 and @xmath239 , although always preserving @xmath248 .",
    "the same happens with the couplings of @xmath249 ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "combining these couplings one can construct the proton decay diagrams shown in figure  [ pdecay ] , which lead to @xmath251 .",
    "there are similarly diagrams leading to @xmath252 , although no @xmath253 is allowed by @xmath254 conservation .",
    "when contracting the heavy gauge boson propagator one gets an effective dimension six operator @xmath255 which is the one responsible for the p - decay . to compute the decay rate is somewhat delicate , since qcd corrections with gluons exchanged between the external quark lines are sizeable ( overall factor @xmath256 ) , and there are also significant uncertainties coming from the hadronic matrix elements , which have to be estimated from hadronic bag models or qcd sum rules . as a result ,",
    "one gets typical estimates for the proton lifetime @xmath257 although this lifetime is huge , it is measurable by looking to large quantities of protons ( 1  kton of water has some @xmath258 protons ) .",
    "actually the search for proton decay to test gut predictions was the original purpose of the large underground detectors imb and kamiokande .",
    "however , these searches proved to be in vain , and the present bound set by superkamiokande is @xmath259  yr , clearly excluding the simplest version of su(5 ) gut .",
    "we have seen that in su(5 ) the sm higgs doublet belongs to a @xmath207 in which also a triplet is present .",
    "this colored triplet also mediates proton decay through the diagram in figure  [ tripletpd ] .",
    "although the diagram is suppressed by yukawa couplings as compared to the gauge boson mediated ones , it would anyhow lead to extremely rapid proton decay unless the triplet states are sufficiently heavy , typically @xmath260  gev . making the triplet state",
    "so heavy , while at the same time keeping the sm doublet higgs sufficiently light ( @xmath261 ) constitutes the so - called doublet - triplet splitting problem , which is one of the challenges for the gut theoreticians . writing the most general scalar potential with the higgses present in minimal su(5 ) , i.e. with @xmath207 and @xmath204 , gives rise to mass terms for both @xmath212 and @xmath211 of the order of the gut scale .",
    "it is possible however to fine - tune the couplings in the potential so that @xmath262 at tree level , but this relation is generally not stable under radiative corrections .",
    "one possible solution , the `` missing partner '' mechanism , is to couple the @xmath207 to a multiplet containing triplet states but no doublets ( such as the @xmath263 in su(5 ) ) , and hence through this coupling , which also involves the @xmath264 , only the triplet acquires a ( large ) mass , with the doublet remaining light . another possibility is to start with a scalar potential with a large global symmetry ( larger than the gut gauge one ) , and such that when the symmetry is broken the doublet higgs boson remains as a goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken global symmetry @xcite , being then naturally light at tree level without the need of fine - tuning the couplings .",
    "yet another possibility ( and there are many more ) which has received attention recently involves the gut breaking by orbifold compactification of extra dimensions @xcite .          lacking any observation of proton decay , nucleon decay experimenters turned then to study just the background in their detectors , which consists of the atmospheric neutrinos produced by the cosmic rays hitting the top of the atmosphere .",
    "these lead to the greatest success of those experiments through the observed deficit in the ratio of @xmath266 fluxes . in particular",
    ", the zenith angle dependence of this ratio measured by the superkamiokande experiment lead to a very clean signal supporting neutrino oscillations ( such that muon neutrinos oscillate into tau neutrinos in their way from the top of the atmosphere up to the detectors , and at multi - gev energies can do that efficiently when coming from below but do nt have enough time to oscillate when coming from above ) . the implied neutrino mass difference @xmath267  ev@xmath268 constitutes indeed the main evidence in favor of physics beyond the sm that we have at present .",
    "the favored mechanism to generate naturally small neutrino masses is the so - called see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "this requires the existence of right handed neutrinos , which being sm singlets can naturally acquire a large mass in some stage of gut breaking . through the combined action of a dirac mass term and the singlet majorana mass term , with @xmath269 one gets the light mass eigenstates with masses ( here we are ignoring the family structure ) @xmath270 so that the lightness of the neutrinos is just due to the heaviness of the right handed states .    the necessary appearance of right handed neutrinos in guts such as so(10 ) is then most welcome , and the see - saw mechanism naturally fits within those models ( and in general in left - right gut models also ) .",
    "one difficulty however with so(10 ) is that to give a mass to @xmath75 through a yukawa coupling involving the fermion bilinear @xmath271 requires the introduction of a large higgs multiplet , the @xmath272 , since by decomposing the so(10 ) multiplets above into their su(5 ) content , it can be checked that only the @xmath272 contains the singlet state corresponding to the bilinear right handed neutrino combination .",
    "such large representations are however not found for instance when obtaining these gut theories from the field theory limit of a superstring theory .",
    "one possibility to give mass to the right - handed neutrino in so(10 ) without introducing a @xmath272 is to do it radiatively with two vacuum insertions of a scalar @xmath142 effectively acting as a @xmath273 , or more generally just using non - renormalisable couplings .",
    "very soon after the observation of cp violation in the kaon system , sakharov realized that it was possible to generate dynamically the baryon asymmetry through microphysical processes taking place in the early universe .",
    "besides the cp ( and c ) violation , which account for the asymmetry between particles and antiparticles , he found that it was necessary to have baryon number violating interactions ( so as to have @xmath274 at the end starting from an initial state with @xmath275 ) and to be out of equilibrium , so that these same interactions do not erase the generated baryon asymmetry . at the time",
    "there were no theories predicting @xmath31-violating interactions , so that when gut models were proposed to unify the gauge interactions , the prediction that they should lead to @xmath31-violating couplings was very welcome by cosmologists .",
    "since this @xmath31-violation is linked to very heavy particles ( the triplet higgses @xmath211 or the @xmath276 gauge bosons for the su(5 ) case ) , the departure from equilibrium could take place just after these particles become non - relativistic in the very hot universe .",
    "the annihilation and decay rates at this stage may not be fast enough to keep the densities at their equilibrium values in the rapidly cooling universe .",
    "the traditional scenario for baryogenesis was for instance to have the heavy su(5 ) higgs triplets decaying out of equilibrium and through @xmath31 and @xmath277 violating decay channels .",
    "@xmath277 violation implied e.g. @xmath278 , and this can occur once loop effects are considered .",
    "however , when in the eighties it was realized that sphaleron mediated @xmath31 violation in the sm was unsuppressed at temperatures @xmath279  gev @xcite , it was clear that this could have the effect of erasing any asymmetry produced previously at the gut stage .",
    "electroweak anomalous processes change both @xmath31 and @xmath239 , but leaving intact @xmath254 .",
    "hence , the way out was to have a gut theory generating initially a non - zero @xmath254 , but this was not the case in the simplest su(5 ) model , which preserves @xmath254",
    ". the other possibility would be to have baryogenesis at ( or below ) the electroweak scale , when sphalerons are no more active .",
    "an interesting proposal is the so - called leptogenesis @xcite , in which the heavy right - handed neutrinos of the see - saw model decay at early times violating lepton number ( with @xmath277 violation resulting in @xmath280 ) .",
    "the lepton asymmetry so produced is later partially transformed into a baryon asymmetry by the sphaleron processes .",
    "this is at present the most natural way of explaining the observed excess of matter over antimatter , since it just requires the see - saw mechanism and to be not particularly unlucky with the choice of model parameters .",
    "in general one says ( following thooft ) that a small parameter in a theory is natural when setting it to zero increases the symmetry of the problem , so that this very same symmetry is the responsible for the smallness of the parameter .",
    "for instance , when applied to particle masses one has that the masslessness of a vector field can be related to the gauge invariance of the theory ( as in the case of the photon ) , while the vanishing of a dirac fermion mass is associated to a chiral symmetry ( and the vanishing of a neutrino majorana mass may be associated to a lepton number symmetry ) .",
    "however , for a scalar field in general no symmetry is gained when setting the mass to zero , except in the very particular case in which the boson is the goldstone boson of a global symmetry .",
    "this implies that even if we set by hand the tree level scalar mass to zero , there is no symmetry protecting it from acquiring large ( quadratically divergent ) corrections at the loop level .",
    "these quadratic divergences make the low energy model with fundamental scalars very sensitive to the ultraviolet structure of the theory , and the small scalar masses are then unnatural",
    ". the solution of this dilemma can be either to abandon the concept of fundamental scalars , as in technicolor models , or to search for a theory where the offending quadratic divergences miraculously cancel .",
    "since fermion loops have opposite sign as bosonic loops , a theory associating to each fermion a bosonic partner , and relating their couplings so as to ensure the cancellation of the quadratically divergent loop corrections associated to them , would be able to do the miracle .",
    "this is what is called supersymmetry , which is a symmetry relating bosons with fermions , and in so doing allows in some sense for chiral symmetry to protect also bosonic masses .",
    "an important point is that in order that the quadratically ` divergent ' loop corrections to the sm higgs boson mass do not exceed the electroweak scale ( and hence the expected value of the higgs boson mass ) , i.e. @xmath281  gev)@xmath268 , the cutoff signaling the energy at which supersymmetry should enter to play a role should be @xmath282  gev@xmath283tev .",
    "hence , the solution of the naturalness problem requires that supersymmetry be present at the weak scale , and not much above .",
    "what supersymmetry does is to pair together fermionic and bosonic fields , and mix them up through the supersymmetric transformations , which can schematically be written as @xmath284 on the other hand two supersymmetric transformations can produce a translation since @xmath285 and hence supersymmetry is intimately related to poincar invariance .",
    "there is indeed a theorem ( due to haag , lopuszaski and sohnius ) stating that the most general symmetry of the @xmath286 matrix is just susy@xmath287poincar@xmath287internal symmetries .",
    "moreover , the fact that supersymmetric transformations can generate translations indicates that making supersymmetry a gauge symmetry ( so that the transformation parameters depend on the space - time point ) should lead to invariance under general coordinate transformations and hence automatically include general relativity .",
    "local supersymmetry ( supergravity ) may then be the road to incorporate gravity into the sm .",
    "since susy transforms fermions into bosons and vice - versa , it requires the existence of fermionic generators @xmath288 , and the above mentioned relation between two susy transformations and a translation results from the susy algebra relation @xmath289 ( with the dot over the index just indicating that it refers to the conjugate of the generator , and @xmath290 ) . a useful concept to write down supersymmetric lagrangians",
    "is that of superspace , introduced by salam and strathdee @xcite .",
    "the superspace includes a fermionic ` coordinate ' @xmath291 which is somehow conjugate to the supersymmetric generator @xmath288 , in the same sense that the usual coordinates @xmath292 are conjugate variables to @xmath293 .",
    "the supersymmetric particle multiplets are then described by superfields defined in the superspace @xmath294 .",
    "the basic multiplets of a supersymmetric theory are :    * the chiral supermultiplet @xmath295 contains a complex scalar @xmath296 , a weyl fermion @xmath297 and an auxiliary scalar @xmath183 ( this last is not propagating since its equation of motion is just algebraic , involving no derivatives , and hence it can be eliminated in favor of the other two propagating fields ) . under an infinitesimal global supersymmetric transformation with parameter @xmath298",
    "one has , as anticipated in eq .",
    "( [ susy ] ) , that @xmath299 and @xmath300 . on the other hand ,",
    "the transformation of the auxiliary field is a total derivative , @xmath301 . *",
    "the real vector multiplet @xmath302 is used to describe gauge fields @xmath303 , and has the associated fermionic partners @xmath304 known as gauginos , which will then be in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the superfield associated to them has also an auxiliary component , the @xmath305 scalar field , which also transforms into a total derivative under an infinitesimal susy transformation . *",
    "the graviton supermultiplet involves the spin two graviton @xmath80 paired to its superpartner , the spin @xmath306 gravitino .",
    "the trick to write down a supersymmetric lagrangian is to exploit the fact that auxiliary @xmath183 terms of chiral multiplets and @xmath307 terms of vector multiplets transform under susy as total derivatives , and are hence good lagrangian densities .",
    "for instance , one can construct a vector superfield from the following combination of the matter chiral superfields @xmath209 and gauge boson vector superfield @xmath302 , @xmath308\\phi_j.\\ ] ] it can be seen that the @xmath307 term ( auxiliary part ) of this superfield , when written in terms of component fields , includes the usual fermion covariant derivative involving the coupling to the gauge bosons , and is hence the appropriate supersymmetric generalization of the gauge invariant fermion kinetic term .",
    "this lagrangian density also includes new terms such as a fermion - sfermion - gaugino coupling ( with the same strength as the previous one as required by supersymmetry ) .",
    "furthermore , it also includes a quartic scalar coupling @xmath309 , where @xmath310 the strength of this quartic scalar coupling is @xmath89 , as required in order that the quadratic divergences in the sfermion self energies coming from the scalar loop associated to this quartic coupling ( summed to the loop involving the gauge bosons ) cancels with the one coming from the fermion - gaugino loop .",
    "the gauge kinetic terms result from the @xmath183 component of the chiral field obtained from the square of the so - called field - strength chiral field , @xmath311 .",
    "finally , the yukawa couplings result from the @xmath183 term of the superpotential @xmath22 , which is a generic cubic ( so as to be renormalizable ) polynomial in the chiral fields , i.e. @xmath312 in order for @xmath22 to be a chiral superfield , it is necessary that it be an holomorphic function of the chiral superfields @xmath209 , not involving the conjugate fields , and this has important phenomenological implications .",
    "for instance , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) two higgs doublets of opposite hypercharge are required to give masses to up - type and down - type quarks .",
    "this is different than what happens in the sm , where one can freely use the conjugate higgs doublet @xmath313 ( which has opposite hypercharge as @xmath212 ) together with @xmath212 for this purpose , but this is not derivable from a superpotential in a supersymmetric framework .",
    "another reason justifying the need for two higgs doublets is that the higgsino fermionic partners contribute to triangle anomalies , and hence two higgsinos with opposite charges are required to cancel them .    besides giving rise to the yukawa couplings @xmath314",
    ", the superpotential also generates a contribution to the scalar potential depending on @xmath315 .",
    "the complete scalar potential is then @xmath316 again the quadratic divergences of the scalar fermion masses associated to the quartic couplings present in @xmath317 , which are proportional to @xmath318 , cancel with those from the ordinary fermion loops induced by the yukawa couplings @xmath88 .      following the procedure described in the previous section one can then write down a supersymmetric lagrangian involving the standard model fields and their superpartners ( the scalar fermions : sleptons , sneutrinos and squarks ; the gauge fermions : gluinos , winos and binos ; the higgs fermions or higgsinos ) .",
    "clearly an immediate drawback of this would be the appearance of all these states with the same charges and masses as the sm ones but different spin , which are not observed in nature .",
    "this implies that supersymmetry has to be broken , so as to lift the degeneracy in mass inside supermultiplets and make the superpartners sufficiently heavy and beyond present experimental bounds .",
    "however , to retain the good properties of susy , this breaking has to be ` soft ' , i.e. without reintroducing quadratic divergences @xcite .",
    "this means that only some kind of susy violating terms in the lagrangian are allowed , such as bilinear or trilinear scalar couplings ( but not quartic ones ) and gaugino masses ( but not fermion yukawa couplings without their associated @xmath317 terms in the potential ) .",
    "the susy soft breaking lagrangian can then be written as @xmath319 where @xmath320 are gaugino masses , while @xmath321 contains the cubic terms in the superpotential , but with the superfields replaced by their scalar components .",
    "similarly , the quadratic term is @xmath322 .",
    "we have not specified the family structure of the different couplings , but once this one is taken into account , it is found that the most general softly broken supersymmetric lagrangian contains more than one hundred new unspecified parameters , clearly introducing a lot of arbitrariness in the model building .",
    "moreover , generic parameters can induce large fcnc effects and violate bounds on @xmath323 , on @xmath324 or @xmath325 , they can lead to large @xmath277 violating electric dipole moments for the neutron or the electron , they can affect @xmath326 or @xmath327 , etc .. in particular , the absence of a generalized gim mechanism to suppress fcnc can be understood from the fact that the fermion - fermion - neutral gauge boson coupling remains diagonal after a unitary rotation of the fermion fields , and the sfermion - sfermion - gauge boson also after a unitary rotation of the sfermion fields , but however the fermion - sfermion - gaugino vertex will not be diagonal in the flavor indices after going to the mass eigenstate basis .",
    "the way to break spontaneously supersymmetry without breaking lorentz invariance is to induce a non - vanishing vev for the auxiliary component of a superfield , i.e. either @xmath328 ( @xmath183 breaking ) or @xmath329 ( @xmath307 breaking ) . in this case",
    "the ground state energy will be non - vanishing ( see eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) ) , what is the signal of global supersymmetry breaking .    in global supersymmetry",
    "breaking there is an important constraint on the resulting mass spectrum , which is known as the tree - level supertrace formula , i.e. @xmath330 for instance , considering just a chiral multiplet with a scalar component @xmath331 , the typical spectrum after supersymmetry breaking will be to have the scalar and pseudoscalar components splitted with respect to the fermionic particle in such a way that @xmath332 , i.e. @xmath333 ( the two in the fermionic contribution to the supertrace comes from the two d.o.f .",
    "of a weyl fermion ) .",
    "this clearly can not be implemented in the observable sector of the supersymmetric sm , since it would imply for instance the existence of scalar fermions lighter than the corresponding fermions ( or with negative squared masses ) .",
    "hence , the usual strategy is to break supersymmetry in a hidden sector not directly coupled to the sm fields , and communicate it to the observable sector by gravitational effects ( gravity mediation ) , at the loop level by means of gauge interactions ( gauge mediation ) or for instance exploiting the superconformal anomaly ( anomaly mediation ) .",
    "a cartoon of this general framework is shown in figure  [ itacu.fig ] , which was drawn after a week of rain during the meeting at the itacurua island : the hidden sector is represented by the sky above the clouds , which was totally disconnected from the observable sector .",
    "the thick layer of clouds represent the messenger fields , which are in contact with both sectors and once in a while let some photons go through , allowing the breaking of susy ( the sunshine ) to be transmitted into the observable sector , giving rise to the tenuous light that we could see .",
    "the simplest way to suppress fcnc effects is by having a mechanism of supersymmetry breaking mediation giving rise to universal scalar masses @xmath334 , so that in first approximation the mass eigenstates can be freely rotated . in gravity mediation scenarios ,",
    "this is usually attributed to the universal character of gravitational interactions , that should then generate a common soft mass for all scalar fermions ( also generation independent @xmath296 and @xmath31 soft terms are predicted ) . in gauge mediation scenarios ,",
    "the scalar masses arise at two - loops and turn out to be proportional to the gauge coupling constant ( @xmath335 ) , so that for instance squarks are degenerate among themselves as a result of the blindness of gauge interactions to the family indices .",
    "it has to be noticed however that the universal conditions will hold at the messenger scale ( i.e. at the planck scale for gravity mediation , or at a smaller scale @xmath336  tev for gauge mediation ) , but these masses run for decreasing scales and in so doing induce non - universalities in the mass spectrum .",
    "one then generally predicts anyway the presence of non - zero fcnc effects at low energies , which in gravity mediation schemes are sometimes even at the verge of contradicting experimental bounds .",
    "regarding the gaugino masses , one often assumes for simplicity that there is a unification relation , so that they become all equal at the gut scale ( @xmath337 ) in gravity mediation scenarios , while in gauge mediation ones they arise at one loop and are hence proportional to the corresponding gauge couplings .",
    "we see then that the new parameters of a supersymmetric model can be significantly restricted in specific models . for instance , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with gravity mediation one has just the five parameters @xmath338 and @xmath4 .",
    "a lot of work has been devoted to try to understand the origin of soft terms and to relate the low energy predictions with the possible mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking and mediation , which are the biggest unknowns for supersymmetry model builders .",
    "as we already mentioned , the supersymmetric sm requires the existence of at least two complex higgs doublets with opposite hypercharges @xmath339 this represents 8 d.o.f . , and when the electroweak symmetry gets broken 3 will be eaten by the massive gauge bosons @xmath340 and @xmath13 , leaving one physical charged higgs @xmath341 and three neutral ones ( one pseudoscalar @xmath296 and two scalars , @xmath342 and @xmath212 ) .    the neutral higgs potential will have the following contributions :    * the soft mass terms : @xmath343 * the bilinear soft term : @xmath344 * the @xmath317 terms latexmath:[\\[\\sum_i|f_i|^2\\supset \\left| { \\partial w^{(2)}\\over \\partial h^0_1}\\right|^2 + \\left| { \\partial w^{(2)}\\over \\partial h^0_2}\\right|^2=\\mu^2\\left (    * the @xmath307 terms",

    "the origin is unstable ( and hence the electroweak symmetry is broken ) as long as @xmath352 . at the gut scale",
    "these two conditions are incompatible under the assumption of universality ,",
    "i.e. if @xmath353 , but a quite remarkable property of the mssm is that in the running to low energies , the effects of the large top yukawa coupling pushes down the parameter @xmath354 , which can become negative leading to what is known as the radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "actually this desireable feature provided the first theoretical hint for the need to have a large top mass @xcite , at a time when most phenomenologist believed that the top mass had to be at the few tens of gev level .",
    "the minimization of the higgs potential leads to a vacuum state with @xmath355 with @xmath356 and in order to reproduce the correct electroweak scale one needs to satisfy @xmath357 equation ( [ sbeta ] ) is usually employed to trade the parameter @xmath31 by @xmath358 , while the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) is usually employed to express @xmath359 in terms of the remaining susy parameters ( leaving sign(@xmath4 ) undetermined ) .",
    "hence , after imposing the electroweak symmetry breaking constraints the additional parameters present in the gravity mediated mssm , assuming universality and unification , are @xmath360    the mass spectrum in the higgs sector is directly obtained by expanding the scalar potential around its minimum , and in so doing one finds that the lightest higgs boson mass satisfies @xmath361 . this tree - level relation ( which is essentially excluded by present lep bounds ) is sizeably affected by one - loop corrections to the scalar potential arising from the large top yukawa coupling .",
    "these lead to a contribution @xmath362 , which can bring the higgs mass above present bounds , but anyhow a generic prediction of the mssm is that the lightest higgs should be lighter than @xmath363  gev .",
    "hence , the experimental search for a higgs boson in this mass range is a very important test for supersymmetry , since failing to find it would exclude the most natural models of weak scale supersymmetry .",
    "another important aspect of the radiative corrections to the higgs potential is that they reduce its overall scale - dependence , since as we mentioned before the tree level parameters @xmath364 where running significantly ( some even changing sign ) as the weak scale was approached , and hence the higgs spectrum and couplings obtained from the tree level potential would have a strong scale dependence , but this is cured by the radiative corrections .",
    "the higgs boson searches at lep have focused mainly on the higgs - strahlung process ( @xmath365 ) , from which essentially all the kinematically allowed range @xmath366  gev has been excluded ( for @xmath367 , since otherwise the @xmath368 coupling is suppressed ) . for large tan@xmath369",
    "the preferred discovery channel is @xmath370 , i.e. the light higgs production in association with the pseudoscalar @xmath296 , and this has excluded the range @xmath371  gev .      to obtain the sparticle spectrum one has to run all soft breaking parameters from high energies ( assuming some proper boundary conditions , probably motivated by the absence of fcnc , simplicity and predictability ) down to the weak scale .",
    "a plausible spectrum arising from this exercise for gravity mediated scenarios is depicted in figure  [ spectrum ] .",

    "colored particles get splitted from uncolored ones due to the running associated to strong interactions , and in this way gluinos are typically much heavier than charginos or neutralinos , and squarks are much heavier than sleptons .",
    "third generation squarks are lighter than those of the first two generations due to the effects of the yukawa couplings .        since this doubling of degrees of freedom associated to the superpartners is expected to appear below the tev scale , upcoming colliders ( tevatron run ii , lhc , @xmath50 linear colliders ) are ideal to search for these particles , which indeed constitute one of their main targets .",
    "one of the most appealing hints in favor of supersymmetry at the weak scale is related to the effects that it has on the running of the gauge couplings . in a supersymmetric scenario ,",
    "the experimentally observed gauge couplings do indeed unify at a unique scale , and this one is large enough to be consistent with proton decay constraints ( see figure  [ susyrge ] ) .",
    "this can be seen from the change in the @xmath369 functions arising from the additional contributions produced by loops involving gauginos and sfermions , which for instance make su(3 ) somewhat less asymptotically free ( @xmath372 instead of the non - susy value of @xmath373 ) , and make the su(2 ) beta function positive ( @xmath374 ) , while for @xmath30 one has @xmath375 , as can be easily checked using eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) .",
    "these changes delay the unification of the couplings up to @xmath376  gev , and work provided the threshold scale @xmath377 above which the supersymmetric spectrum appears is light enough , @xmath378 .",
    "tev.,width=396 ]      we saw that in non - supersymmetric guts proton decay was due to four fermion operators of the form @xmath379 which resulted from the contraction of the propagator of the very heavy triplet higgs or gauge bosons .",
    "being these operators of dimension @xmath380 , they were suppressed by two powers of the gut scale ( i.e. @xmath381 ) .",
    "these lead to @xmath382yr@xmath383gev@xmath384 , which was in contradiction with observations for the non - supersymmetric gut scale of @xmath385  gev . in susy ,",
    "the gut scale becomes @xmath386  gev , and hence there is no conflict with proton decay arising from @xmath380 operators . in the supersymmetric case",
    "there are however new operators , involving two bosons ( squarks or sleptons ) and two fermions , which can induce proton decay , and since these are @xmath387 , they are suppressed by only one power of the gut scale ( i.e. by the contraction of one heavy fermionic propagator , such as the one from higgsino triplet exchange ) .",
    "hence , @xmath387 operators turn out to be the dangerous ones .",
    "since initial and final states involve ordinary quark and leptons , the @xmath387 operators have to be ` dressed ' with light susy partners , as is shown in figure  [ susypdec ] .",
    "this typically results in the proton decay rate being proportional to @xmath388 , and hence it is quite sensitive to the supersymmetric spectrum ( increasing for heavier gluinos ! ) .",
    "another important fact is that writing the operators in terms of superfields , which obey bose statistics , one can realise the need to antisymmetrize them with respect to the family indices . for instance",
    ", the operator @xmath389 is acceptable since it is antisymmetric in both color ( @xmath390 ) and flavor ( @xmath391 ) indices .",
    "this implies that the dominant proton decay channel in supersymmetric models is not into pions ( involving first generation quarks ) but into kaons .",
    "typical predictions for the lifetime of this channel are @xmath392 the superkamiokande bound of @xmath393  yrs then excludes part of the supersymmetric parameter space , disfavoring in particular heavy gluinos for large @xmath394 , with the bounds depending on the assumed scale for the scalar masses @xmath395 .",
    "operators.,width=396 ]      one important difficulty that has to be faced when trying to write down a supersymmetric version of the standard model is that there are yukawa - like couplings which are consistent with gauge and super symmetries but violate baryon or lepton number .",
    "the allowed trilinear couplings are @xmath396 hence , unlike what happens in the sm , in its supersymmetric version @xmath31 and @xmath239 are not automatic symmetries of the lagrangian .",
    "if the above mentioned couplings are allowed , they can give rise to extremely fast proton decay , mediated by the exchange of squarks or sleptons with weak scale masses , so that very strong constraints result on the product of some pairs of couplings ( typically @xmath397 ! ) . to make these couplings",
    "so small is unnatural , so that the simplest solution is to eliminate them directly by invoking a symmetry , the so - called r - parity .",
    "r - parity distinguishes between standard model particles , which are r - even ( e.g. @xmath398 and @xmath399 under r parity ) , and their superpartners , which are r - odd ( e.g. @xmath400 or @xmath401 ) .",
    "hence , imposing r symmetry the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ rparity ] ) are forbidden , while those of the standard yukawa couplings involving the higgs doublet are allowed .",
    "the discrete r - parity symmetry need not necessarily be imposed by hand , and may be the left over , after susy breaking , of a continuous r symmetry ( i.e. a symmetry of the susy lagrangian which also transforms the grassman variables @xmath402 ) or it may be related to an underlying gauge symmetry .",
    "for instance , in so(10 ) models the allowed yukawa couplings involve the @xmath403 , and this does not include the @xmath404 violating couplings ( that would be in the @xmath405 , which is not so(10 ) invariant ) .",
    "the conservation of r - parity has some very important phenomenological implications :      + regarding the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , the supersymmetric contribution arises from the diagrams in figure  [ susyamu ] . since these are flavor and cp conserving processes they are hard to avoid , and they are of a similar size as the electroweak contributions .",
    "the recent brookhaven results on @xmath417 where the first to be sensitive at the level of the electroweak corrections , and the 2.6 standard deviation discrepancy with respect to the sm expectations they reported then clearly attracted a lot of attention from the supersymmetric community .",
    "the magnetic moment has associated with it a flip in the chirality of the fermion , and hence this is why the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , although measured more accurately , is not a good place to look for supersymmetry ( @xmath418 ) .",
    "the left - right transition in @xmath419 can take place also through the higgsino vertex ( proportional to @xmath420 ) or through a l ",
    "r smuon mass insertion in the scalar propagator ( proportional to @xmath421 ) .",
    "hence the susy contribution is relevant for large tan@xmath369 , with typical predictions being @xmath422 .",
    "the reported results ( after correcting with the new theoretical estimates @xcite ) , @xmath423 , then suggest that tan@xmath369 should be large and that the supersymmetric mass scale @xmath395 should be below a few hundred gev , with two superpartners ( one of them being charged ) being then at the reach of future collider experiments .",
    "the supersymmetric explanation of @xmath424 also preferres positive values of @xmath4 , and this goes in the same direction as @xmath73 results , and as we saw is also good news for future experiments looking for supersymmetric dark matter . + in conclusion , the sm has been extremely successful in accounting for existing experimental data , and has been subject to several precision tests . with the energy frontier",
    "being pushed above the electroweak scale by upcoming experiments , and rare processes becoming tested with high sensitivity , we are entering the stage in which the search for new physics is becoming the main experimental goal in particle physics .",
    "certainly some revolution in our understanding of the underlying laws of nature will come out from this .",
    "the present ` light ' notes on the basic aspects of some of the major attempts to extend the sm have the aim to just motivate the ( experimental and theoretical ) students to undertake the study of this very broad subject , about which many books and specialized review articles have been written . here below are listed a few of them which can be useful for this purpose , and in them also a comprehensive list of references to the original works can be found :    * p. langacker , `` grand unified theories and proton decay '' , phys . rept . *",
