    "globular cluster ( gc ) systems are common in disk and elliptical galaxies and in the past decade significant observational progress has been made in understanding them .",
    "these globular clusters are frequently used to help understand the formation and evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "however , the observational properties of globular clusters are not fully understood .",
    "a case in point is the half - light radius ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "several models show that the the half - light radius of a cluster should remain fairly constant during its lifetime @xcite so it is often used to compare the structures of globular clusters of different ages .",
    "several observational studies , however , show that metal - poor ( blue ) globular clusters have half - light radii that are systematically larger ( by @xmath2 ) than their metal - rich ( red ) counterparts @xcite .    it is not clear what the origin of this discrepancy is nor is it certain that it truly represents a difference in the sizes of the clusters as measured by their half - mass radii ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that the observed enhancement in the size of the blue clusters could be due to a projection effect .",
    "they note both that blue and red globular clusters follow different radial distributions and that in the milky way there is a relationship between cluster size and galactocentric distance @xcite .",
    "they argue that if such a relationship exists in all galaxies , the differing radial distributions of red and blue clusters could account for the observed difference in sizes .",
    "a detailed survey by @xcite , however , showed that the ratio of @xmath1 between blue and red clusters does not depend on galactocentric distance , as would be predicted by the @xcite model .",
    "furthermore , @xcite give no reason why a galactocentric distance - globular cluster size trend should exist in other galaxies .",
    "@xcite explained the difference as a result of differing stellar evolution processes in metal - poor and metal - rich stellar populations .",
    "metal poor stars lose less mass and have longer main - sequence lifetimes than metal - rich stars . assuming that the difference between red and blue stellar populations is metallicity , this leads to differing luminosity functions in blue and red gcs . using multi - mass michie - king models with fixed half - mass radii and a stellar population with an age of 13 gyrs ,",
    "@xcite was able to re - produce the observed @xmath1 enhancement in blue globular clusters . however , these models are not dynamical simulations of globular cluster evolution and the results are valid only if @xmath3 is the same in red and blue globular clusters .    by contrast @xcite",
    "used direct @xmath4-body simulations to investigate the differences in dynamical evolution between blue and red open clusters .",
    "they also assumed that the colour of a cluster reflects its metallicity and argued that , because metal - poor stars lose mass more slowly than metal - rich stars , blue clusters will lose less mass to stellar evolution over their lifetimes than will red clusters .",
    "this reduces the gravitational potential of red clusters , causing them to expand and become larger than blue clusters .",
    "however , scattering interactions between the more massive metal - poor stars will be more energetic than those between less massive metal - rich stars and the blue clusters will experience stronger two - body heating .",
    "this will cause them to expand relative to the red clusters once the initial phase of rapid mass - loss is concluded .",
    "if the effect of two - body heating is stronger , blue clusters will be physically larger than red clusters .",
    "@xcite showed that the half - mass radii of their simulated blue clusters were indeed @xmath2 larger after several initial half - mass relaxation times ( @xmath5 ) than the half - mass radii of their simulated red clusters .",
    "they also found little difference between the ratio of @xmath3 and @xmath1 between blue and red clusters .",
    "therefore they conclude that the enhancement in @xmath1 in blue globular clusters is due to an actual size enhancement and has a dynamical origin .",
    "the @xcite models , however , contain 10 - 100 times fewer stars than are present in globular clusters and consequently relax and dissolve when they are only a few hundred myr old , far younger than the 10 - 13 gyr age of many globular cluster systems .",
    "the relationship between stellar evolution timescales and dynamical timescales is also quite different in these simulations than in gcs .    in this paper",
    "i re - visit the problem of size differences between blue and red globular clusters by analyzing a set of monte carlo star cluster models .",
    "these are self - consistent dynamical simulations that contain a similar number of stars to globular clusters , include parametrized stellar evolution and primordial binaries .",
    "i will investigate whether my blue globular clusters are larger than the red ones , as was reported by @xcite .",
    "if they are , i will determine if @xmath1 is enhanced to the same degree as @xmath3 and if the processes reported by @xcite have an significant effect .",
    "i will also be able to determine weather or not @xmath1 is a good observational proxy for @xmath3 .",

    "the primary advantage to this method over direct @xmath4-body is speed ; the monte carlo code scales with @xmath16 , where @xmath4 is the number of stars in the system , as opposed to @xmath17 for direct @xmath4-body codes .",

    ", however , the monte carlo method treats the cluster as an ensemble of particles and can provide the same star - by - star information as a direct @xmath4-body simulation .",

    "half - mass and half - light radii are clearly larger in blue clusters.[fig : hl - hm-13],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the simulations come in two metallicities , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . throughout the paper",
    "i will refer to the @xmath29 clusters as the `` red '' clusters and the @xmath30 clusters as the `` blue '' clusters .",
    "one significant difference between the red and blue simulations is the treatment of black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "metal - poor stars lose less mass to line - driven winds than do metal - rich stars and experience more matter fallback after supernovae @xcite .",
    "this produces both more and more massive bhs in the blue clusters .",
    "bhs also receive natal kicks drawn from a maxwellian distribution with a peak at 190 km / s @xcite , significantly higher than the escape velocity of a gc .",
    "this kick is then reduced according to the amount of fallback on to the bh during the supernova @xcite . because the amount of fallback is larger in the blue clusters ,",
    "the bhs in these clusters receive a larger kick reduction and are less likely to escape .",
    "the combination of the larger bh masses and higher bh retention rates leads to significant differences in the bh populations of blue and red clusters .     as a function of time for all three different initial concentrations.[fig : rhmtime],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the combination of initial concentration and metallicity give 6 different sets of initial conditions , each of which is then independently realized 10 times to constrain the stochasticity inherent in collisional stellar dynamics .",
    "all values in this paper are an average over all ten realizations unless specifically noted otherwise .",
    "this yields a set of 60 simulations .",

    "@xmath1 is calculated by projecting the luminosity of all stars into annular rings and summing the total luminosity in each ring radially outwards until finding the radius containing half the total luminosity .",
    "the ratio of the value of @xmath3 in blue over the value of @xmath3 in red clusters will hear after be referred to as @xmath33 while the ratio of the value of @xmath1 in blue over the value of @xmath1 in red cluster will be referred to as @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear that both @xmath3 and @xmath1 are enhanced in blue clusters . after 13 gyr",
    "the value of @xmath3 is @xmath2 greater in blue clusters , in rough agreement with the value found after @xmath0 250 myr by @xcite .",
    "by contrast the value of @xmath1 is some @xmath0 40 - 50% greater , a larger enhancement than observed in real clusters .",
    "the difference in @xmath33 and @xmath34 indicates that the enhancement of @xmath1 in blue gcs is not simply the result of a difference in size . that @xmath34 is larger in my simulations than in the observations suggests that my simulations over - predict the difference between blue and red gcs .    .",
    "the top panel gives the number of single bhs while the bottom panel gives the number of bh - bh binaries.[fig : bhpop75],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the time evolution of @xmath33 , shown in figure  [ fig : rhmtime ] , is rather similar to the behaviour found by @xcite ",
    "@xmath3 starts off smaller in the blue clusters but then grows rapidly so the blue clusters become larger than the red ones within an initial relaxation time .",
    "@xcite suggest that this pattern reflects stronger two - body relaxation between the more massive stars in the blue clusters .",
    "both clusters experience strong initial mass - loss due to the rapid evolution of massive stars and because this effect is stronger in the red clusters they initially expand faster .",
    "however , the more energetic two - body interactions between the massive stars in the blue clusters generate more dynamical heat and cause them to expand faster than the red clusters once the initial phase of rapid mass - loss is complete .",
    "thus after the first few hundred myrs the blue clusters become larger than the red ones .     and",
    "@xmath3 between blue and red clusters with @xmath35.[fig : rv75],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    @xcite do not determine whether the dominant source of the two - body heating in the blue clusters is the interactions between a large number of stars , all of which are only slightly more massive than the stars in the red clusters , or if a small population of very massive stars is responsible for the effect .",
    "a comparison of the time evolution of @xmath36 in figure  [ fig : rhmtime ] for different initial concentrations provides a clue . for the lowest density ( dynamically youngest ) clusters the value of @xmath33 slowly grows to @xmath37 and then remains constant whereas in the densest ( dynamically oldest ) cluster @xmath33 grows rapidly but then begins to decline",
    "this indicates that the densest blue clusters start to re - contract compared to the red clusters because the population of stars responsible for the expansion has been lost .",
    "such behaviour suggests a small population of massive objects that can pump a large amount of kinetic energy into the blue clusters through interactions but are also scattered out of the cluster and depleted .",
    "but for clusters where all bhs have been removed by giving them 1000 km / s natal kicks.[fig : rhmtimenobh],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    bhs are excellent candidates for this population : after the first few 100 myrs they are significantly more massive than the average mass in the cluster ; they are expected to mass - segregate to the core , become spitzer - unstable @xcite , and interact strongly ; they are also few in number so they can be rapidly depleted by interactions .",
    "@xcite presented simulations that show a population of bhs can lead to a significant growth in core radius compared to simulations without bhs .",
    "figure  8 of the same paper suggests the same may be true for @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , @xcite propose that the bhs mass - segregate to the centres of the clusters where they strongly interact and form bh - bh binaries .",
    "@xcite show that this also occurs in my simulations .",
    "these binaries scatter single bhs from the cluster centre to its outer regions . from there",
    "these bhs sink back to the centre of the cluster due to dynamical friction .",
    "this process does @xmath38 work on the cluster per bh where @xmath39 is the mass of the bh and @xmath40 is the gravitational potential of the cluster .",
    "this work dynamically heats the cluster and causes it to expand .    .",
    "the top panel gives the cumulative mass - loss due to stellar evolution and escapers , the middle the cumulative number of escapers and the bottom the total mass as a function of time.[fig : m - mloss],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : models ] , there can be major differences between the bh populations in my red and blue simulations .",
    "i show the population of bhs in the @xmath41 simulations in figure  [ fig : bhpop ] .",
    "i choose to analyze this set of simulations because there are the least extreme set of initial conditions and should be the most generally representative .",
    "figure  [ fig : bhpop ] confirms that the blue clusters indeed have a larger population of bhs and that these bhs are significantly more massive than those in the red clusters .",
    "the blue clusters also produce slightly larger numbers of bh - bh binaries slightly earlier than the red clusters but the difference is not nearly as great .",
    "this is in line with the model of @xcite where the bh - bh binaries do not interact directly with the rest of the cluster but only with other bhs .",
    "it is these scattered single bhs that are responsible for the dynamical heating of the luminous stellar population .",
    "although the red clusters have not insubstantial bh - bh binary populations compared to the blue clusters , they do not have a sufficient number of sufficiently massive single bhs to heat the rest of the cluster and cause it to expand .",
    "the bh hypothesis also explains the evolution of the most concentrated clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : bhpop75 ] shows that the both bhs and bh - bh binaries are rapidly depleted in the @xmath35 clusters .",
    "consequently these clusters loses this source of dynamical heat .",
    "the monte carlo models remain in virial equilibrium to within a fraction of a per cent by construction so this loss of heat must be compensated for by a change in the structure of the cluster .",
    "the virial radius , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total mass of the cluster , @xmath44 the velocity dispersion and @xmath45 the kinetic energy , is a good measure of this change .",
    "figure  [ fig : rv75 ] shows that the ratio of @xmath46 between the blue and red clusters increases while there are many bhs and bh - bh binaries and then decreases when these objects are depleted . indeed the drop in the ratio of @xmath46 and a sharp drop in the number of bh - bh binaries both occur at @xmath47 gyr .",
    "the ratio of @xmath46 also tracks the evolution of @xmath33 very closely .",
    "this strongly supports the case that heating by bhs is responsible for the size differences between these clusters .    .",
    "the total energy of each star is given in units of the core kinetic energy of the cluster .",
    "the low - energy peak is primarily ejections due to two - body relaxation while the high - energy peak is ejections due to interactions with binaries.[fig : eesc],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to confirm that the difference in @xmath3 between my blue and red clusters is a result of the different bh populations i have run a set of simulations without bhs . for each set of initial conditions listed in table  [ tab : simparams ]",
    "i have performed an additional five simulations , identical up to and including the random seed , but where all bhs are given a kick of 1000 km / s upon formation .",
    "this instantaneously removes all black holes while allowing the cluster to continue its evolution .",
    "values of @xmath36 for the clusters without bhs are given in figure  [ fig : rhmtimenobh ] and can be compared to the results for clusters with bhs given in figure  [ fig : rhmtime ] .",
    "the results are dramatic  the enhancement in @xmath48 of blue clusters completely disappears ! indeed the trend observed in figure  [ fig : rhmtime ] is reversed : the blue clusters are slightly larger at early times  probably due to the fact that bhs are more numerous and massive in these clusters , resulting in more mass loss when they are ejected  and slightly smaller at late times .",
    "the effect in figure  [ fig : rhmtimenobh ] is only @xmath49 , much smaller than the @xmath2 differences observed in figure  [ fig : rhmtime ] .",
    "because the only difference between these two sets of simulations is the bh population , this proves that the enhancement in @xmath3 observed in my first set of blue clusters is due to the dynamical activity of bhs .",
    "but for clusters without bhs.[fig : m - mloss - nobh],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one effect i observe in my simulations with bhs that was not extensively discussed by @xcite is a difference in the total escape rate of stars from the blue and red clusters ( @xcite examine only the escape rate of bhs ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : m - mloss ] i show that the blue clusters lose more stars , both by number and by mass , to escape than do the red clusters .",
    "by contrast the red clusters lose slightly more mass to stellar evolution than do the blue clusters .",
    "the difference in mass lost to escapers is larger and the blue clusters lose more mass overall than do the red clusters . figure  [ fig : resc ] shows that the majority of these additional escapers come from the central regions of the cluster , which suggests they are stars that have gained additional energy through interactions with the bh sub - system .",
    "this additional mass - loss from the cluster centre will cause the inner lagrangian radii to expand compared to the overall radius of the cluster and enhance the expansion of @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : eesc ] gives the total energy of each escaping star ( @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the kinetic energy of the star and @xmath52 is its mass ) as a function of the position of its last interaction before escaping from the cluster .",
    "most of the additional escapers in the inner region do not have particularly high energies .",
    "therefore they are unlikely to have been ejected in an interaction with a binary .",
    "rather they have gained their energy due to strong two - body relaxation in the inner regions of the cluster .",
    "this is fully consistent with the results of @xcite who found that the bh - bh binaries do not interact with other cluster stars directly but only with the single bhs .",
    "it is two - body heating from these single bhs that produce the expansion of the cluster and the higher escape rate .     between blue and red clusters for all initial concentrations with and without bhs .",
    "the top panel gives the values for clusters with bhs while the bottom panel gives the values for clusters without bhs.[fig : rhltime],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in figure  [ fig : m - mloss - nobh ] i compare the mass - loss and escaper rates in blue and red clusters without bhs .",
    "the difference in total number of escapers almost completely disappears .",
    "there is still a difference between the mass lost due to escapers but the majority of this occurs early and can be attributed to the instantaneous ejection of bhs from the clusters . because the blue clusters form more bhs and these bhs are more massive , it follows that the blue clusters will lose more mass when they are ejected .",
    "this may also explain the slightly larger values of @xmath3 in blue clusters without bhs at early times .",
    "this difference has little effect on the total mass of the clusters and , unlike the case with bhs , the blue and red clusters have approximately the same mass at 13 gyrs of age .",
    ".[fig : fraclum],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure  [ fig : hl - hm-13 ] shows that the value of @xmath34 is larger both than @xmath33 and than the value that is observed in real gcs .",
    "therefore it is clear from these simulations that @xmath34 is not necessarily a good predictor of @xmath33 . to understand the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath33 i compare the time evolution of @xmath34 in clusters with and without bh in figure  [ fig : rhltime ] .",
    "the half - light radii are clearly larger in blue clusters for all sets of initial conditions , regardless of whether @xmath3 is larger or not .",
    "the enhancement in @xmath1 in the clusters without bhs is smaller but is actually in much better agreement with the observed enhancement of @xmath2 , at least for the two most initially concentrated clusters .",
    "the difference between @xmath3 in the blue and red clusters with bhs contributes to the difference in @xmath1 but clearly there are other processes at work .",
    ".[fig : mseg],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in figure  [ fig : fraclum ] i compare the fraction of the total luminosity in the most massive 10% of stars for the blue and red clusters while in figure  [ fig : mseg ] i compare the mass - segregation in these clusters using the average masses within selected lagrangian radii .",
    "the red clusters have a steeper luminosity function with a significantly larger proportion of their luminosity concentrated in their most massive stars . the average stellar mass is higher for the inner lagrangian radii in both blue and red clusters so both sets of clusters are mass - segregated . for a given lagrangian radius ,",
    "however , the average mass is similar in both the blue and the red clusters . taking figures  [ fig : fraclum ] and figure  [ fig : mseg ] together , this means that the red clusters will have a larger fraction of their luminosity located within their innermost lagrangian radii than will the blue clusters and thus they will have a smaller value of @xmath1 compared to @xmath3 .",
    "consequently the value of @xmath34 will be larger than the value of @xmath33 .",
    "this explains why @xmath53 in clusters of the same size according to @xmath3 .",
    "the effect will be further enhanced if the blue clusters are also larger than the red clusters and explains the greater value of @xmath34 in clusters with bhs .",
    "however it is not necessary for a cluster with a larger value of @xmath1 to have a larger value of @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests an additional corollary : @xmath1 can not be used to measure the relative sizes of gcs , at least not in a straightforward way .",
    "my simulations show that blue gcs can be larger than red gcs but only if they have a substantial population of bhs .",
    "blue and red clusters without bhs will be roughly the same size but the red clusters will still have smaller values of @xmath1 due to their steeper luminosity functions .",
    "i find that the enhancement in @xmath1 for blue clusters with bhs is significantly larger than that observed value . in the clusters without bhs",
    "the enhancement in @xmath1 roughly matches the observations , at least for the clusters with the highest initial concentrations .",
    "this finding supports the results of @xcite  that the difference in half - light radii between blue and red gcs is the result of different luminosity functions in clusters with similar sizes  rather than the results of @xcite .",
    "it may also indicate that there is little difference between the bh population in blue and red gcs .",
    "this will have consequences for understanding effect of metallicity on the late - time evolution and supernovae of massive stars .",
    "the simulations of @xcite used the initial mass function of @xcite , which has a high - mass slope of @xmath54 , and used a maximum mass of @xmath55 m@xmath25 ( glebbeek , private communication ) .",
    "such a mass function will yield few bhs so a question remains as to why my simulations with bhs behave in a qualitatively similar way to those of @xcite while the ones without bhs do not .",
    "i speculate that the similarity is a result of the differing relationship between the stellar evolution and the relaxation timescales . in my simulations",
    "@xmath5 is significantly longer than the evolution timescale for massive stars , even in the most concentrated clusters .",
    "thus by the time relaxation becomes important for the structure of the cluster the only remaining population of stars significantly more massive than average are the bhs .",
    "by contrast the relaxation timescales of the simulations of @xcite are @xmath010 - 50 myr , shorter than the evolution timescales of moderately massive stars .",
    "therefore these stars remain when two - body relaxation starts to drive cluster evolution .",
    "furthermore , the short relaxation time will allow these stars to mass - segregate before they lose a significant amount of their mass to winds and nuclear burning .",
    "interactions between these stars will be able to act as a heat source in a similar way to the bh sub - system in my simulations .",
    "i hypothesize that small clusters , with relaxation times shorter than the evolution timescale for massive stars , have a variety of objects massive enough to drive cluster expansion through two - body heating while in gcs , where the relaxation timescale is much longer than the stellar evolution timescale , bhs are the only remaining objects massive enough to produce this effect .",
    "to @xmath3 for all simulated gcs .",
    "thin lines are red gcs while thick lines are blue gcs .",
    "the top panel gives the values for gcs with bhs while the bottom panel gives values for gcs without bhs.[fig : rhlrhm],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is also apparent that the value of @xmath34 is not the same as that of @xmath33 and thus it can not be used as a direct estimate of the relative sizes of gcs .",
    "indeed a comparison of figures  [ fig : rhmtimenobh ] and  [ fig : rhltime ] shows that a cluster can have a smaller value of @xmath3 than another cluster but still have a larger value of @xmath1 . in figure  [ fig : rhlrhm ]",
    "i show the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath3 for all of my cluster models .",
    "the ratio varies considerably both with time and with the initial conditions used .",
    "the ratio does seem to attain a fairly stable value for each individual cluster , indicating that @xmath1 is not completely independent of @xmath3 . since this value always lies somewhere between 0.35 and 0.7 it is , in principle , possible to use @xmath1 to estimate the value of @xmath3 to within a factor of @xmath56 .",
    "it is not possible , however , to use @xmath34 to estimate the relative size of two clusters unless ( at minimum ) their metallicities , initial concentrations , and ages are known .",
    "i have analyzed a suite of monte carlo globular cluster simulations to determine the origin of the difference in half - light radii between blue and red gcs .",
    "i find that , provided they are mass - segregated , the value of @xmath1 is larger in blue than in red gcs simply due to differences in the luminosity function between metal - poor and metal rich stellar populations .",
    "depending on the initial conditions this effect is sufficient to explain the observed differences between @xmath1 in blue and red gcs .",
    "i find that it is also possible for blue clusters to be physically larger than red clusters as measured by their half - mass radii .",
    "however this only occurs if there are significant differences in the number and properties of bhs between metal - poor and metal - rich stellar populations . a difference in @xmath3",
    "can certainly enhance the difference in @xmath1 but it is not a necessary condition for such a difference to exist .",
    "furthermore , the enhancement in @xmath1 in blue gcs when a there is significant difference in the bh population is larger than observed .",
    "this leads me to conclude that blue and red gcs probably do not have significant differences in their bh populations but further simulations and more careful comparisons with observations will be necessary to confirm this .",
    "further simulations are also necessary to determine if it is number or mass that determines whether bhs can cause a gc to expand .",
    "finally , i find that @xmath34 does not directly predict @xmath33 so differences in @xmath1 can not be used to infer differences in size between clusters of different metallicities .",
