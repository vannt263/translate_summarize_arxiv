    "in qcd or the massive schwinger model in @xmath3 vacuum @xcite , it is well known that the scalar operator condense while the pseudoscalar does not ; @xmath4 where the second equation follows from parity symmetry . however ,",
    "if we have a non - zero @xmath5 term , which violates parity symmetry , both of them have non - zero expectation values ; @xmath6 which indicates that @xmath7 meson should have a long - range correlation as @xmath8    we would like to present our numerical results of the 2-flavor massive schwinger model with a @xmath1 term .",
    "we investigate @xmath9 condensates and the @xmath0 meson correlators in each topological sector .",
    "it is also found that they are non - trivially related each other to reproduce the @xmath5 dependence .",
    "we find that their behavior is well understood by the intuitive picture based on the clustering decomposition and the statistical mechanics .",
    "in particular , our study shows that the accurate contributions from higher topological sectors are essential in order to assure parity symmetry , which never allows the long - range correlation of the @xmath0 meson correlators .",
    "moreover , it is also shown that the origin of the fluctuations of disconnected diagram is from pseudoscalar condensates in each topological sector .",
    "our strategy to calculate the @xmath5 vacuum effects is to separate the integral of the gauge fields into topological sectors ; @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes a coupling constant and @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the expectation value and the partition function in a fixed topological sector respectively .",
    "the expectation values with a fixed topological charge ; @xmath12 are evaluated by generating link variables with the following gauge action @xcite ; @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes a plaquette and @xmath16 is a fixed constant .",
    "this action impose the lscher s bound @xcite on the gauge fields , which realize an exact topological charge on the lattice , that is never changed in each step of the the hybrid monte carlo updation .",
    "@xmath17 normalized by that of zero topological sector can be evaluated by decomposing it into three parts ; @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the classical minimum of the gauge action with topological charge @xmath20 , @xmath21 denotes the moduli integral , and @xmath22 , all of which are numerically calculable @xcite .",
    "we choose the domain - wall fermion action with pauli - villars regulators for sea quarks .",
    "the link variables are updated by the hybrid monte carlo algorithm .",
    "the parameters are chosen as @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "we take @xmath25 and @xmath26 lattice where @xmath27 denotes the size of the extra dimension of domain - wall fermions .",
    "50 molecular dynamics steps with a step size @xmath28 are performed in one trajectory .",
    "configurations are updated every 10 trajectories . for each topological sector",
    ", around 500 trajectories are taken for the thermalization staring from the initial configuration which is the classical instanton solution with topological charge @xmath20 .",
    "we generate 300 configurations in @xmath29 sectors for the measurements and from 1000 to 10000 for the reweighting factors at various @xmath30 , where @xmath31 at @xmath32 and @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "the topological charge dependence of pseudoscalar condensates is derived by the anomaly equation ; @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the volume of the torus . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : condaxq ] , our data show a good agreement with this equation .",
    "then the @xmath0 meson correlators should have long - range correlations . from the clustering decomposition , this can be expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 means the expectation value with the topological charge @xmath39 in the region @xmath40 which denote the half of the large box , where the pseudoscalar operators reside , respectively and @xmath41 denotes the probability of the distribution where @xmath39 instantons appear in the box @xmath42 and @xmath43 appear in the box @xmath44 .    in @xmath45 case , one obtains @xmath46 where we assume @xmath47 and use the anti - symmetry;@xmath48 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : condaxq ] . on the other hand , at large @xmath20 ,",
    "assuming the distribution @xmath41 to be gaussian around @xmath49 , the correlation can be evaluated as follows , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a numerical constant . as seen in fig  [ fig : longq ] , it is surprising that these very simple arguments describe the data quite well .",
    "@xmath5 dependence of the @xmath0 correlators are evaluated by substituting the data into eq.([eq : exp ] ) .",
    "[ fig : etaproptheta ] shows the result .",
    "it is obvious that there are long - range correlations at @xmath1 while @xmath3 case is consistent with zero , which suggests our reweighting method works well at small @xmath5 .",
    "we study @xmath20 and @xmath5 dependence of the pseudoscalar condensates and the @xmath0 meson correlators . we find",
    "that pseudoscalar does condense in each topological sector ; @xmath52 and there exists a long - range correlation of @xmath0 meson ; @xmath53 which are well understood by the clustering properties .",
    "it is also found that each contribution from different topological sectors plays very important role to produce non - trivial @xmath5 dependence of these observables . in particular , the cancellation the long - range correlation of @xmath0 meson requires accurate measurements of higher topological sectors .",
    "it is also obvious that the fluctuation of the disconnected diagrams originates from these pseudoscalar condensates .",
