    "<S> this scaling of polymers ( [ 1 ] ) is perfectly described by the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) on a _ regular _ @xmath0-dimensional lattice @xcite and the fractal dimension of a polymer chain readily follows : @xmath8 . for space dimensions @xmath0 above the upper critical dimension @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> the scaling exponent becomes trivial : @xmath10 , whereas for @xmath11 the non - trivial dependence on @xmath0 is described e.g. by the phenomenological flory formula @xcite @xmath12 . </S>",

    "<S> such a situation might be experimentally realized studying a polymer solution in a porous medium , but is of its own interest as well  the asymptotic scaling behavior is a more subtle matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> numerous mc simulations @xcite and exact enumeration studies @xcite , which last since early 80-ies @xcite , lead to the conclusion that there are the following regimes for the scaling of a saw on a disordered lattice : ( i ) weak disorder , when the concentration @xmath15 of bonds allowed for the random walker is higher than the percolation concentration @xmath16 and ( ii ) strong disorder , directly at @xmath17 . by further diluting the lattice to @xmath18 no macroscopically connected cluster , `` percolation cluster '' , remains and the lattice becomes disconnected . in regime ( i ) the scaling law ( [ 1 ] ) is valid with the same exponent @xmath19 for the diluted lattice independent of @xmath15 , whereas in case ( ii ) the scaling law ( [ 1 ] ) holds with a new exponent @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> a hint to the physical understanding of these phenomena is given by the fact that weak disorder does not change the dimension of a lattice visited by a random walker , whereas the percolation cluster itself is a fractal with fractal dimension dependent on @xmath0 : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are familiar percolation exponents @xcite . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath7 must change along with the dimension @xmath24 of the ( fractal ) lattice on which the walk resides . </S>",
    "<S> a modified flory formula @xcite for the exponent of a saw on the percolation cluster @xmath25 along with results of similar theoretical studies @xcite gives numbers in an astonishing agreement with the data observed ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . since @xmath26 for percolation @xcite , the exponent @xmath27 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the flory - like theories @xcite offer good approximations for @xmath28 in a wide range of @xmath0 , even more astonishing is the fact that up to now there do not exist any satisfactory theoretical estimates for @xmath28 based on a more refined theory , which takes into account non - markovian properties of the saw , a task which was completed for regular lattices already in mid-70-ies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> existing real - space rg studies @xcite give satisfactory estimates for @xmath29 , whereas the field - theoretical approaches aimed to describe the situation at higher dimensions lead to contradictory conclusions . in particular , the field theory developed in ref . </S>",

    "<S> however the numerical estimates obtained from this result are in poor agreement with numbers observed by other means , leading in particular to the surprising estimate @xmath31 in @xmath32 ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . in turn , a subsequent study @xcite even questioned the renormalizability of this field theory and suggested another theory with @xmath9 which is obviously disproved by computer simulations and exact enumerations at dimensions @xmath33 @xcite .    .

[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there is another important reason , why the scaling of a saw on a percolation cluster calls for further theoretical study . as it became clear now , higher - order correlations of a fractal object at another fractal lead to multifractality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently studied examples of multifractal phenomena are found in such different fields as diffusion in the vicinity of an absorbing polymer @xcite , random resistor networks @xcite , quantum gravity @xcite . a saw on a percolation cluster is a good candidate to possess multifractal behavior . indeed </S>",
    "<S> such behavior is found in computer simulations @xcite , moreover it naturally emerges in the rg scheme , as we will explain below .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a diluted lattice with sites @xmath35 in terms of variables @xmath36 that indicate whether a given bond between the sites @xmath35 and @xmath37 is present or not . to describe the critical properties of saws on this lattice following the idea of de gennes @xcite we introduce @xmath38-component spin variables @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and evaluate the theory for @xmath41 </S>",

    "<S> this is achieved @xcite via a stratonovich - hubbard transformation to tensor fields @xmath48 with components @xmath49 conjugated to the product @xmath50 of @xmath51 components of the replicated spin with @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the effective hamiltonian up to order @xmath53 @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the fourier transform of @xmath56 , the inner product reads : @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a symbolic notation for a product of three @xmath59 fields . only those cubic terms @xmath53 are allowed for which all pairs @xmath60 appear exactly twice . </S>",
    "<S> a second condition on the diagrammatic contributions to perturbation theory can be derived from the de gennes limit @xmath41 , namely , if any index @xmath61 appears only on the internal propagator of a diagram , then its contribution vanishes .    </S>",
    "<S> we note the unusual dependence of  masses \" @xmath62 on @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this is reminiscent of the fact that in the @xmath41 limit the theory ( [ 2 ] ) becomes multicritical @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has impact on the renormalization of the theory ( [ 3 ] ) as we will show in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> we choose to calculate the critical properties of the theory by analyzing its vertex functions , in particular @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 where the latter includes an insertion of the @xmath66 operator . </S>",

    "<S> these integrals are evaluated then in dimensional regularization in dimension @xmath70 and minimal subtraction @xcite using a laurent - expansion in @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> usually the renormalization of the vertex functions is defined in terms of @xmath72-factors in such a way that the products @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 are free of @xmath71-poles . </S>",
    "<S> however , the insertion of the @xmath66-operator together with the @xmath51-dependence of the masses @xmath62 leads to the following renormalization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the vertex function @xmath69 even when evaluated at zero mass remains @xmath51-dependent : @xmath76 and it can not be renormalized by one multiplicative @xmath72-factor . </S>",
    "<S> the essential feature of this expansion is that each term shows a different scaling behavior . </S>",
    "<S> in this way the multicriticality recognized already by derrida @xcite and meir and harris @xcite manifests itself in our present formalism and leads to a _ spectrum of exponents_. instead of a single @xmath72-factor @xmath77 a whole family of factors @xmath78 is necessary to renormalize each @xmath79 in ( [ 4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to define rg - functions @xmath80 that describes the rg - flow of the coupling with respect to the rescaling parameter @xmath81 and @xmath82 which define the anomalous dimensions of the corresponding operators . at the stable fixed point @xmath83 with @xmath84 the family of correlation exponents </S>",

    "<S> ( iv ) performing the summation over the replica indices the contributions to the different @xmath79 are generated by rearranging the expansion in @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> one finds the multiplicative renormalization for @xmath79 for appropriate linear combinations of the different orders of @xmath51 .    following this procedure we obtain @xmath2 expansions for @xmath95 . substituting them together with the known result @xcite @xmath96 into ( [ 6 ] ) we arrive at the following spectrum of correlation exponents : @xmath97 by ( [ 7 ] ) we recover the familiar @xmath71-expansion for the percolation exponent @xmath23 @xcite and in ( [ 8 ] ) we extend the first order result for @xmath34 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical interpretation and properties of the remaining exponents @xmath88 of the family is the subject of a separate study @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> exponents for the shortest and longest saw on percolation cluster @xcite are shown by dotted lines.,width=264 ]    a rather peculiar finding is that results of the phenomenological flory - like formulae evaluated using the fractal characteristics of the percolation cluster are numerically very close to our result in the same region of dimensions . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath53 theory as applied to the present problem inevitably has the upper critical dimension @xmath26 . </S>",
