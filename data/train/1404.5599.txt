    "central to the formation of multicellular organisms is the ability of cells with identical genetic material to acquire distinct cell fates according to their position in a developing tissue @xcite .",
    "while many mechanistic details remain unsolved , there is a wide consensus that cells acquire knowledge about their location by measuring local concentrations of various form - generating molecules , called `` morphogens '' @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "these morphogens are transcription factor proteins that control the activity of other genes , themselves coding for transcription factors , resulting in a regulatory network whose successive layers produce ever more refined spatial patterns of gene expression @xcite .",
    "the systematic variation in the concentrations of these morphogens with position defines a chemical coordinate system , used by cells to determine their location @xcite .",
    "morphogens are thus said to contain `` positional information '' , which is processed by the genetic network , ultimately giving rise to cell fate assignments that are very reproducible across the embryos of the same species @xcite .",
    "the concept of positional information has been widely used as a qualitative descriptor and has had an enormous success in shaping our current understanding of spatial patterning in developing organisms @xcite .",
    "mathematically , however , positional information has not been rigorously defined .",
    "specific morphological features during early development have been studied in great detail and shown to occur reproducibly across wild - type embryos @xcite , while perturbations to the morphogen system resulted in systematic shifts of these same features @xcite .",
    "this established a causal  but not quantitative  link between the positional information encoded in the morphogens and the resulting body plan .",
    "building on previous as well as on new results , we provide the missing quantitative link by proposing a mathematical formalism for positional information .    specifically , we set out to achieve the following goals : first , we define positional information and positional error formally within the context of shannon s information theory @xcite ; second , we identify features of developmental gene expression that increase or decrease the information ; and third , we establish the inference tools necessary to measure positional information in real datasets .",
    "we focus on conceptual and data analysis details , with the explicit aim of presenting our framework such that it can be applied to different developmental systems . in two related papers ,",
    "we have presented the experimental details , limitations , and interpretation when applying the proposed framework to the early _ drosophila _ embryo @xcite .    in _ drosophila _ , the entire body plan of the future adult organism is established by a hierarchical network of interacting genes during the first three hours of embryonic development @xcite .",
    "the hierarchy is composed of three layers : long - range protein gradients that span the entire long axis of the egg @xcite , gap genes expressed in broad bands @xcite , and pair - rule genes that are expressed in a regular seven - striped pattern .",
    "these genes typically encode transcription factors , hence allowing the layers to interact .",
    "positional information is provided to the system solely via the first layer , which is established from maternally supplied and highly - localized mrna that act as protein sources for the maternal gradients @xcite .",
    "the network then uses these inputs to generate distinct rows of nuclei that express the downstream genes in unique and distinguishable combinations in a process that takes two to three hours to complete @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that such precision can be achieved in such a short amount of time using only a few handfuls of genes .",
    "gene expression is subject to intrinsic fluctuations , which trace back to the randomness associated with regulatory interactions between molecules present at low absolute copy numbers @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is random variability not only within , but also between , embryos , for instance in the strength of the morphogen sources @xcite .",
    "these biophysical limitations ",
    "in the number of signaling molecules , the time available for morphogen readout , and the reproducibility of initial and environmental conditions ",
    "place severe constraints on the ability of the developmental system to generate reproducible gene expression patterns @xcite .",
    "traditionally , precision and reproducibility have been thought of as the ability to generate spatially sharp boundaries between broad bands of gene expression , where each gene would be either `` on '' or `` off '' in each of the expression domains .",
    "this view , which starts with the assumption that there are only two biologically meaningful levels of expression , has been challenged recently by showing that the morphogen _ bicoid _ transmits 1.5 bits of information to the gap gene _",
    "; this would suffice for three ( instead of two ) distinguishable levels of _ hunchback _ response @xcite .",
    "moreover , a total of , e.g. , four gap genes , each of which can provide at most one bit ( `` on '' or `` off '' ) of information , is insufficient to uniquely specify even in principle the fates of more than @xmath0 nuclei , while the number of nuclei along the relevant segment of long axis of the _ drosophila _ embryo is closer to @xmath1 @xcite . taken together , these considerations indicate that gap genes could be more than just `` binary switches , '' encoding a single bit of positional information each in their expression domains . to address these conflicting interpretations rigorously , we need to be able to make _ quantitative _ statements about the positional information of spatial gene expression profiles without presupposing which features of the profile ( e.g. sharpness of the boundary , size of the domains , position - dependent variability , etc ) encode the information .    here",
    "we make the case that the relevant measure for positional information is the _ mutual information _",
    "@xmath2a central information - theoretic quantity defined by shannon in the 1940s  between expression profiles of the gap genes and position in the embryo .",
    "briefly , for a given level of gene expression noise within an embryo and a given level of gene profile variability across embryos in a population , the quantity @xmath2 represents the binary logarithm of the number of rows along the embryo axis that have distinguishable gene expression levels . in other words , @xmath3 is an upper bound to the possible number of distinct equiprobable cellular identities .",
    "we show how positional information puts mathematical limits to the ability with which cells in the developing _ drosophila _ embryo can infer their position if they respond to gap gene concentrations ( and thus the morphogen gradient ) alone .",
    "this allows us to quantitatively decide whether the picture of sharp `` on''/``off '' domains of gene expression is sufficient , and to ask how variability across embryos impedes the ability of the patterning system to transmit positional information . in order to apply this information - theoretic approach to real data , we solve a number of technical challenges related to the limitations of the current experimental setups .",
    "we report on these innovations in detail in order to prepare our approach for a straightforward generalization to other developmental systems .",
    "in this section we establish the information - theoretic framework for positional information carried by spatial patterns of gene expression . to develop an intuition , we start with a one - dimensional toy example of a single gene , which will be generalized later to a many - gene system . we present scenarios where positional information is stored in different qualitative features of gene expression patterns . to capture that intuition mathematically , we give a precise definition of positional information for one and for multiple genes .",
    "finally , we show how a quantitative formulation of positional information is related to `` decoding , '' i.e. the ability of the nuclei to infer their position in the embryo .",
    "let us consider the simplest possible example where the expression of a single gene @xmath4 varies with position @xmath5 along the axis of a one - dimensional embryo .",
    "we choose units of length such that @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to the anterior and posterior poles of the embryo , respectively .",
    "suppose we are able to quantitatively measure the profile of such a gene along the anterior - posterior axis in @xmath8 embryos , labeled with an index @xmath9 .",
    "such measurements of the light intensity profile of fluorescently labelled antibodies against a particular gene product yield @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the quantitative readout in embryo @xmath12 of the gene expression level . from a collection of embryos  after suitable data processing steps described later  we can then extract two statistics : the position - dependent `` mean profile , '' capturing the prototypical gene expression pattern , and the position - dependent variance across embryos , which measures the degree of embryo - to - embryo variability or the reproducibility of the mean profile .",
    "we can transform the measurements @xmath4 into profiles @xmath13 with rescaled units , such that the mean profile @xmath14 is normalized to 1 at the maximum and to 0 at the minimum along @xmath5 .",
    "after these steps , our description of the system consists of the mean profile , @xmath14 , and the variance in the profile , @xmath15 .    how much can a nucleus learn about its position if it expresses a gene at level @xmath16 ?",
    "we will compare three idealized cases , where we pick the shape of @xmath14 by hand and assume , for the start , that the variance is constant , @xmath17 . the first case is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ infovsprecision]a , where a step - like profile in @xmath18 splits the embryo into two domains of gene expression : an anterior `` on '' domain , where @xmath19 for @xmath20 , and an `` off '' domain in the posterior , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "this arrangement has an extremely precise , indeed infinitely sharp , boundary at @xmath23 ; if we think that the precision of the boundary is the biologically relevant feature in this system , this arrangement would correspond to an ideal patterning gene . but how much information can nuclei extract from such a profile ? if @xmath23 were @xmath24 , the boundary would reproducibly split the embryo into two equal domains : based on reading out the expression of @xmath16 , the nucleus could decide whether it is in the anterior or posterior , a binary choice that is equally likely prior to reading out @xmath16 .",
    "as we will see , the positional information needed ( and provided by such a sharp profile ! ) to make a clear two - way choice between two a priori equally likely possibilities equals 1 bit .",
    "can a profile of a different shape do better ?",
    "figure  [ infovsprecision]b shows a somewhat more realistic sigmoidal shape that has a steep , but not infinitely sharp , transition region . if the variance is small enough , @xmath25 , this profile can be more informative about the position .",
    "nuclei far at the anterior still have @xmath26 ( full induction or the `` on '' state ) , while nuclei at the posterior still have @xmath27 ( the `` off '' state ) .",
    "but the graded response in the middle defines new expression levels in @xmath16 that are significantly different from both @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "a nucleus with @xmath30 will thus `` know '' that it is neither in the anterior nor in the posterior",
    ". this system will therefore be able to provide more positional information than the sharp boundary which is limited by 1 bit .",
    "clearly , this conclusion is valid only insofar as the variance @xmath31 is low enough ; if it gets too big , the intermediate levels of expression in the transition region can no longer be distinguished and we are back to the 1 bit case .",
    "the extreme contrast to the infinitely sharp gradient is the linear gradient , depicted in fig .",
    "[ infovsprecision]c .",
    "wolpert already proposed that linear gradients might be efficient in encoding positional information @xcite , and indeed we can extend the argument for the sigmoidal case to convince ourselves that if @xmath31 is not a function of position , the linear gradient is the best choice .",
    "consider starting at the anterior and moving towards the posterior : as soon as we move far enough in @xmath5 that the change in @xmath14 is above @xmath32 , we have created one more distinguishable level of expression in @xmath16 , and thus a group of nuclei that , by measuring @xmath16 , can differentiate themselves from their anteriorly - positioned neighbors .",
    "finally , this reasoning gives us a hint about how to generalize to the case where the variance @xmath31 depends on position , @xmath5 .",
    "what is important is to count , as @xmath5 covers the range from anterior to posterior , how much @xmath14 changes _ in units of the local variability , @xmath33_it will turn out that this is directly related to the mutual information between @xmath16 and position .    thus a sharp and reproducible boundary can correspond to a profile that does not encode a lot of positional information , and a linear profile where the boundary is not even well - defined can encode a high amount of positional information . ultimately , whether or not there are intermediate distinguishable levels of gene expression depends on the variability in the profile .",
    "therefore , any measure of positional information _ must _ be a function of both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "does the ability of the nuclei to infer their position automatically improve if they can simultaneously read out the expression levels of more than one gene ?",
    "figure  [ shapesandcorr]a shows the case where two genes , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , do not provide any more information than each one of them provides separately , because they are completely redundant .",
    "redundant does not mean equal  indeed , in fig .",
    "[ shapesandcorr]a the profiles are different at every @xmath5but they are perfectly correlated ( or dependent ) : knowing the expression level of @xmath34 one knows exactly the level of @xmath35 , so @xmath35 can not provide any additional new information about the position . in general , redundancy can help compensate for detrimental effects of noise when noise is significant , but this is not the case in the toy example at hand .",
    "the situation is completely different if the two profiles are shifted relative to each other by , say , 25% embryo length .",
    "note that none of the individual profile properties have changed ; both are still infinitely sharp with two states of gene expression , and half of the nuclei express in each state .",
    "however , the two genes now partition the embryo into 4 different segments : the anterior - most domain which is combinatorially encoded by the gene expression pattern @xmath36 , the second domain with @xmath37 , the third domain with @xmath38 and the last domain with @xmath39 . upon reading out @xmath34 and @xmath35 , a nucleus",
    ", a priori located in any of the four domains , can unambiguously decide on a single one out of the four possibilities .",
    "this is equivalent to making 2 binary decisions and , as we will later show , to 2 bits of positional information .",
    "finally , the most subtle case is depicted in fig .",
    "[ shapesandcorr]c . here",
    ", the mean profiles have exactly the same shapes as in fig .",
    "[ shapesandcorr]b . what is different , however , is the correlation structure of the fluctuations . in certain areas of the embryo the two genes",
    "are strongly positively correlated , while in the others they are strongly negatively correlated . if these areas are overlaid appropriately on top of the domains defined by the mean expression patterns , an additional increase in positional information is possible . in the admittedly contrived but pedagogical example of fig .",
    "[ shapesandcorr]c , the mean profiles and the correlations together define 8 distinguishable domains of expression , combinatorially encoded by 2 genes .",
    "nuclei , having simultaneous access to the concentrations of the two genes , can compute which of the eight domains they reside in , although it might not be easy to implement such a computation in molecular hardware .",
    "picking one of 8 choices corresponds to making 3 binary decisions , and thus to 3 bits of positional information .",
    "note that in this case , each gene considered in isolation still carries 1 bit as before , so that the system of two genes carries more information than the sum of its parts  such a scheme is called synergistic encoding .    in sum , we have shown that the mean shapes of the profiles , as well as their variances _ and _ correlations , can carry positional information . extrapolating to 3 or more genes , we see that the number of pairwise correlations increases and in addition higher - order correlation terms start appearing .",
    "formally , positional information could be encoded in all of these features , but would become progressively harder to extract using plausible biological mechanisms .",
    "nevertheless , a principled and assumption - free measure should combine all statistical structure into a single number , a scalar quantity measured in bits , that can `` count '' the number of distinguishable expression states ( and thus positions ) , as illustrated in the examples above .      determining the number of `` distinguishable states '' of gene expression is more complicated in real data sets than in our toy models",
    ": the mean profiles have complex shapes and their ( co)variability depends on position . in the ideal case",
    "we can measure joint expression patterns of @xmath40 genes @xmath41 ( for example @xmath42 for four gap genes in _ drosophila _ ) in a large set of embryos .",
    "in such a scenario the position dependence of the expression levels can be fully described with a conditional probability distribution @xmath43 . concretely , for every position @xmath5 in the embryo we construct an @xmath40-dimensional histogram of expression levels across all recorded embryos , which ( when normalized ) yields the desired @xmath43 .",
    "this distribution contains all the information about how expression levels vary across embryos in a position - dependent fashion .",
    "for instance , @xmath44 are the mean profile of gene @xmath45 , the variance across embryos of gene @xmath45 , and the covariance between genes @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . in principle",
    ", the conditional distribution contains also all higher - order moments that we can extract by integrating over appropriate sets of variables .",
    "realistically , we are often limited in our ability to collect enough samples to construct @xmath43 by histogram counts , especially when considering several genes simultaneously ; the number of samples needed grows exponentially with the number of genes .",
    "however , estimating the mean profiles on the left - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ mp]-[covp ] ) can often be achieved from data directly . a reasonable first step",
    "( but one that has to be independently verified ) is to assume that the joint distribution @xmath43 of @xmath40 expression levels @xmath47 at a given position @xmath5 is gaussian , which can be constructed using the measured mean values and covariances :    @xmath48_{ij}(g_j-\\bar{g}_j(x))\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we emphasize that this gaussian approximation is not required to theoretically define positional information , but that it will turn out to be practical when working with experimental data ; in the cases of one or two genes it is often possible to proceed without making this approximation , which provides a convenient check for its validity .    while the conditional distribution , @xmath43 , captures the behavior of gene expression levels _ at a given @xmath5 _ , establishing how much information , in total , the expression levels carry about position requires us to know also how frequently each combination of gene expression levels , @xmath47 , is used across all positions . recall , for instance , that our arguments related to the information encoded in patterns of fig .  [ shapesandcorr ] rested on counting how often a pair of genes will be found in expression states 00 , 01 , 10 , and 11 across all @xmath5 .",
    "this global structure is encoded in the total distribution of expression levels , which can be obtained by averaging the conditional distribution over all positions : @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes averaging over @xmath5 .",
    "note that we can think of eq .",
    "( [ pg ] ) as a special case of averaging with a position - dependent weight , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is chosen to be uniform .",
    "as we shall see , in the case of _ drosophila _ anterior - posterior ( ap ) patterning , @xmath52 will be the distribution of possible nuclear locations along the ap axis , which indeed is very close to uniform .",
    "when formulated in the language of probabilities , the relationship between the position @xmath5 and the gene expression levels can be seen as a statistical dependency . if we knew this dependency were linear , we could measure it using , e.g. , a linear correlation analysis between @xmath5 and @xmath47 .",
    "shannon has shown that there is an alternative measure of total statistical dependence ( not just of its linear component ) , called the _ mutual information _ , which is a functional of the probability distributions @xmath52 and @xmath43 , and is defined by @xmath53 this positive quantity , measured in bits , tells us how much one can know about the gene expression pattern if one knows the position , @xmath5 .",
    "it is not hard to convince oneself that the mutual information is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "this is very attractive : we do the experiments by sampling the distribution of expression levels given position , while the nuclei in a developing embryo implicitly solve the inverse problem  knowing a set of gene expression levels , they need to infer their position",
    ". a fundamental result of information theory states that both problems are quantified by the same symmetric quantity , the information @xmath55 .",

    "[ infodecoding ] . in the case of a single gene @xmath16 , the `` total entropy '' @xmath60 $ ] , represented on the left , measures the range of gene expression available across the whole embryo .",
    "this total entropy , or dynamic range , can be written as the sum of two contributions .",
    "one part is due to the systematic modulation of @xmath16 with position @xmath5 , and this is the useful part ( the `` signal '' ) , or the mutual information @xmath55 .",
    "the other contribution is the variability in @xmath16 that remains even at constant position @xmath5 ; this represents pure `` noise '' that carries no information about position , and is formally measured by the average entropy of the conditional distribution ( the noise entropy ) , @xmath61\\rangle_x$ ] .",
    "positional information carried by @xmath16 is thus the difference between the total and noise entropies , as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ mi2 ] ) .",
    "mutual information is theoretically well founded , and is always non - negative , being 0 if and only if there is no statistical dependence of any kind between the position and the gene expression level .",
    "conversely , if there are @xmath2 bits of mutual information between the position and the expression level , there are @xmath62 distinguishable gene expression patterns that can be generated by moving along the anterior - posterior ( ap ) axis , from the head at @xmath6 to the tail at @xmath7 .",
    "this is precisely the property we require from any suitable measure of positional information .",
    "we therefore suggest that , mathematically , positional information should be defined as the mutual information between expression level and position , @xmath55 .",

    "these constraints are universal : regardless of how complex the mechanistic details of the cells readout of the gene concentrations levels are , the expression level variability prevents the cells from decreasing the positional error below @xmath102 .",
    "the concept of positional error easily generalizes to the case of multiple genes , and is diagnostic about how positional information is distributed along the ap axis .      in this section",
    ", we survey some technical details related to the application of the formalism of positional information and positional error to real data sets . estimating information theoretic quantities from finite data is , generally , a very difficult problem that has received considerable theoretical attention ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the way we approach this problem productively is to combine general theory and algorithms for information estimation with problem - specific approximations .",
    "we use the four major gap genes in early _ drosophila _ embryos as a test case .",
    "first , we briefly recapitulate our experimental and data processing methods ( for details , see ref  @xcite ) .",
    "next , we present the statistical techniques necessary to consistently merge data from separate pairwise gap gene immunostaining experiments into a single dataset .",

    "_ drosophila _ embryos were fixed and simultaneously immunostained for the four major gap gene [ _ hunchback _ ( _ hb _ ) , _ krppel _ ( _ kr _ ) , _ knirps _ ( _ kn _ ) and _ giant _ ( _ gt _ ) ] proteins , using fluorescent antibodies with minimal spectral overlap , as described in ref  @xcite . in this paper , we analyze a total of four datasets ( a , b , c and d ) . datasets a ",
    "c have been processed simultaneously , but imaged in different sessions .",
    "dataset d has been processed and imaged independently from the other datasets .",
    "hence these datasets are well suited to assess the dependence of our measurements and calculations on the experimental processing .",
    "dataset a has been used previously in refs  @xcite .",
    "fluorescence intensities were measured using automated laser scanning confocal microscopy , processing hundreds of embryos in one imaging session .",
    "cross - sectional images of multi - color labeled embryos were taken with an imaging focus at the midsagittal plane , the center plane of the embryo with the largest circumference .",
    "intensity profiles of individual embryos were extracted along the outer edge of the embryos using custom software routines ( matlab , mathworks , natick , ma ) as described @xcite .",
    "the results in the following sections are presented using exclusively dorsal intensity profiles , and we report their projection onto the anteroposterior ( ap ) axis in units normalized by the total length @xmath96 of the embryo , yielding a fractional coordinate between 0 ( anterior ) and 1 ( posterior ) . the dorsal edge was chosen for its smaller curvature , thus limiting geometric distortion of the profiles when projecting the intensity onto the ap axis .",
    "the ap axis was uniformly divided into 1000 bins , and the average profile intensity in each bin is reported .",
    "this procedure results in a raw data matrix that lists , for each embryo and for each of the four gap genes , one intensity value for each of the 1000 equally spaced spatial positions along the ap axis .    for any successful information - theoretic analysis",
    ", the dominant source of observed variability in the dataset must be due to the biological system and not due to the measurement process , requiring tight control over the experimental setup .",
    "gap gene expression levels critically depend on the developmental stage and on the imaging orientation of the embryo .",
    "since multiple embryos need to be pooled together to assess embryo - to - embryo fluctuations , precise control of these two factors is necessary in order to maximally reduce systematic variability that can be attributed to measurement noise .",
    "therefore we applied strict selection criteria on developmental timing and orientation angle ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis to a time window of @xmath107 , 38@xmath108 into nuclear cycle 14 . during this time interval",
    "the mean gap gene expression levels peak and overall temporal changes are minimal .",
    "a carful analysis of residual variabilities due to measurement error ( i.e. , age determination , orientation , imaging , antibody non - specificity , spectral cross - talk , and focal plane determination ) reveals that the estimated fraction of observed variance in the gap gene profiles due to systematic and experimental error is below 20% of the total variance in the pool of profiles , i.e. , more than 80% of the variance is due to the true biological variability in the gap gene system @xcite .",
    "the fact that the overwhelming fraction of the total variability in our data sets is due to natural fluctuations is a prerequisite for the proposed information - theoretic analysis to yield biological insights .",
    "before the profiles can be compared or aggregated across embryos , they may need to be normalized .",
    "careful experimental design and imaging can make normalization steps essentially superfluous @xcite , but such control may not always be possible .",
    "in general , different antibodies could have different overall specificities and spectral efficiency , and there could be small embryo - to - embryo variations in the overall fluorescence background and staining penetration , even if all the embryos are prepared and imaged concurrently . to deal with these artifacts ,",
    "we introduce three possible types of normalizations , which we call y alignment , x alignment , and t alignment . in y alignment , the recorded intensity of immunostaining for each profile of a given gap gene , @xmath10 recorded from embryo @xmath12 ( @xmath9 ) , is assumed to be linearly related to the ( unknown ) true concentration profile @xmath109 by an additive constant @xmath110 and an overall scale factor @xmath111 ( to account for the background and staining efficiency variations from embryo to embryo , respectively ) , so that @xmath112 .",

    "the parameters @xmath116 are chosen to minimize the @xmath117 and thus maximize alignment , and since the cost function is quadratic , this optimization has a closed form solution @xcite .",
    "additionally , one can perform the x alignment , where _ all _ gap gene profiles from a given embryo can be translated along the ap axis by the same amount ; this introduces one more parameter @xmath118 per embryo ( _ not _ per expression profile ) , which can be again determined using @xmath113 minimization , similar to the above . for @xmath119 , which needs to be carried out numerically .",
    "] there are two candidate sources of variability that can be compensated for by x alignments : ( i ) our error in the exact determination of the ap axis , i.e. , in the exact end - points of the embryo , due to image processing ; ( ii ) real biological variability that would result in all the nuclei within the embryo being rigidly displaced by a small amount along the long axis of the embryo relative to the egg boundary .",
    "as we will see in discussion , the second option has an interesting biological interpretation in terms of correlated positional errors that nuclei might make while reading out positional information .",
    "lastly , the t alignment attempts to compensate for the fraction of observed variability that is due to the systematic change in gene profiles with embryo age even within the chosen 10 minute time bracket .",
    "we can use our knowledge of how the mean profiles evolve with time and de - trend the entire dataset in a given time window by this evolution of the mean profile .",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in ref  @xcite to carry out this alignment .    in sum , each of the three alignments",
    ", x , y and t , subtracts from the total variance the components which are likely to have an experimental origin and do nt represent properly either the intrinsic noise within an embryo or natural variability between the embryos ; since the total variance will be lower after alignment , successive alignment procedures should lead to increases in positional information . strictly speaking , the lower bound on positional information",
    "would be obtained by estimating it using raw data , without any alignment , thus ascribing _ all _ variability in the recorded profiles to the true biological variability in the system , but unless the control over experimental variability is excellent , this lower bound might be far below the true value .",
    "for instance , if embryos can not be stained and imaged in a single session , it would be very hard to guarantee that there are no embryo - to - embryo variabilities in the antibody staining and imaging background .",
    "for that reason , we view the y alignment as the minimal procedure that should be performed unless staining and imaging variability is shown to be negligible in dedicated control experiments .",
    "the choice of performing alignments beyond y depends on system - specific knowledge about the plausible sources of experimental vs biological variability . for these reasons ,",
    "most of the results in the paper are based on the minimal alignment procedure ( y ) , thus yielding conservative information estimates , but we also explore how these estimates would increase for single genes and the quadruplet in case of the other alignments .    once the desired alignment procedure has been carried out , we can define the mean expression across the embryos , @xmath73 for every gap gene @xmath120 , and choose the units for the profiles such that the minimum value of each mean profile across the ap axis is 0 , and the maximal value is 1 . this is the final , aligned and normalized , set of profiles on which we carry out all subsequent analyses , and from which we compute the covariance matrix @xmath121 of eq  ( [ covp ] ) .",

    "measuring positional information from a finite number @xmath8 of embryos is challenging due to estimation biases .",
    "good estimators are thus often more complicated than the naive approach , which consists of estimating the relevant distributions by counting and using the formula , e.g. eq  ( [ mi1 ] ) , for mutual information directly .",
    "nevertheless , the naive approach can be used as a basis for an unbiased information estimator following the so - called _ direct method _ @xcite .    the easiest way to obtain a naive estimate for @xmath126 is to convert the range of continuous values for @xmath45 and @xmath5 into discrete bins of size @xmath127 . on this discrete domain",

    "a potential disadvantage is the amount of data required , which grows exponentially in the number of gap genes . in practice ,",
    "our current data sets suffice for the direct estimation of positional information carried simultaneously by one or at most two gap genes .    to extend this method tractably to more than two genes",

    "the second term ( `` noise entropy '' ) is therefore easily computable from eq  ( [ fga ] ) , for a discretized version of the distribution , @xmath149 , using the ( co-)variance estimate of gene expression levels alone . the first term ( `` total entropy '' ) can be estimated as above by the direct method , i.e. by histogramming @xmath150 for various sample sizes @xmath133 and bin sizes @xmath134 , and extrapolating @xmath151 and @xmath142 .",
    "this combined procedure , where we evaluate one term in the gaussian approximation and the other one directly , has two important properties .",

    "second , by making the gaussian approximation for the second term , we are always _ overestimating _ the noise entropy and thus _ underestimating _ the total positional information , because the gaussian distribution is the maximum entropy distribution with a given mean and variance ( other , non - gaussian distributions with the same mean and variance can only have smaller entropies ) .",
    "therefore , in a scenario where the first term in eq .",
    "( [ fga ] ) is estimated directly , while the second term is computed analytically from the gaussian ansatz , we always obtain a lower bound on the true positional information .",
    "we call this bound ( which is tight if the conditional distributions really are gaussian ) the _ first gaussian approximation _ ( fga ) .    for three or more gap genes",
    "the amount of data can be insufficient to reliably apply either the direct estimate or fga , and one needs to resort to yet another approximation , called the _",

    "we also assume that @xmath152 is gaussian , but we make another assumption in that @xmath153 , obtained by integrating over these gaussian conditional distributions , is a good approximation to the true @xmath153 .",
    "the total distribution we use for the estimation is therefore a gaussian mixture : @xmath154 for each position , the noise entropy in eq .",

    "in contrast , estimating the covariance matrix , @xmath121 , would require simultaneously labeling all @xmath40 gap genes in each embryo using fluorescent probes of different colors .",
    "while simultaneous stainings of two genes are not unusual , it is not easy to scale the method up to more genes while maintaining a precise and quantitative readout .",
    "this is not a concern for the datasets analyzed in this paper , in which all gap genes were simultaneously recorded , but can be a concern when applying our method more generally .",
    "therefore we present an estimation technique for inferring a consistent @xmath156 covariance matrix based on a collection of embryos stained for different pairs of genes .    estimating a joint covariance matrix from pairwise staining experiments is a non - trivial problem for two reasons .",

    "second , true covariance matrices are positive definite , i.e. @xmath157 , a property that is not guaranteed by naively filling in different terms of the matrix by computing them across sets of embryos collected in different experiments .",
    "this is a consequence of small sampling errors that can strongly influence the determinant of the matrix .",
    "we therefore need a principled way to find a single best and valid covariance matrix from multiple partial observations , a problem that has had considerable history in statistics and finance ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "partitioning of the domain into @xmath221 boxes , the relative difference between the mc estimate of the information and the evaluation over an uniform grid is @xmath222 ; this excellent match is shown in fig  [ f10]c . to get the final sga estimate of positional information that the two genes jointly carry about position , extrapolation to infinite data size",
    "is performed in fig  [ f10]d .",
    "figure  [ f11 ] shows the mc estimate of the positional information carried by the quadruplet of gap genes , and its dependence on the parameter @xmath207 ( the number of mc samples per box per position ) and the refinement of the adaptive partition .",
    "when @xmath207 is too small ( e.g. , @xmath220 ) we obtain a biased estimate of the information , presumably because the evaluation of the distribution over boxes is poor , leading to suboptimal recursive partitioning .",
    "when @xmath207 is increased to @xmath223 , the estimates for different @xmath207 start converging as the number of adaptive boxes is increased , and the final estimates ( after extrapolation to an infinitely fine partition ) for different @xmath207 agree to within a few percent .      in this section",
    "we apply the information estimation methods developed above to measure the information content in 1 ) individual gap genes , 2 ) pairs of gap genes , and 3 ) the full set of four gap genes .",
    "the latter we will refer to as the _ gene quadruplet_. to make our analyses consistent and comparable with previous work @xcite , we focus only on dorsal gene expression profiles in the central 1090% segment of the embryos in the 3848 min time class , using the minimal ( y ) data alignment .",
    "we comment on the above - mentioned alternative alignment methods below .",
    "information carried by single genes is reported in table  [ infotable ] .",
    "the values are estimated using the direct method which agrees closely with the alternative estimation methods ( fga , sga ; cf .",
    "[ f7 ] ) . measured across four independent experiments ,",
    "the information values are consistent to within the estimated error bars , indicating that not only embryo - to - embryo experimental variability can be brought under control as described in ref  @xcite , but also that experiment - to - experiment variability is small .",
    ".[infotable ] * information ( in bits ) carried by single genes .",
    "* for each dataset , we report the direct estimate of positional information for the 10 - 90% egg length segment , after y alignment .",
    "error bars are the estimation errors .",
    "the last row contains the ( mean @xmath224 std ) over datasets . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     single genes carry substantially more than 1 bit of positional information , sometimes even exceeding 2 bits .",
    "thus each gap gene alone provides more information about position than what would be conveyed by the hypothesized `` decision threshold '' that separates the embryo into `` on '' and `` off '' expression domains . but",
    "this information is redundantly encoded : the sum of individual positional informations for single genes is always greater than the jointly encoded information ( fig .",
    "[ f13 ] ) , although redundancy at the pairwise level is relatively small ( @xmath225 ) .",
    "such a low degree of redundancy is expected because gap genes are often expressed in complementary regions of the embryo in non - trivial combinations and will thus mostly convey new information about position . unlike in our toy examples in the introduction , real gene expression levels are continuous and noisy , and some degree of redundancy might be useful in mitigating the effects of noise , as has been shown for other biological information processing systems @xcite .",
    "overall , with the addition of the second gene positional information increases well above the 0.5 bits that would be expected theoretically for fully redundant gene profiles .",
    "the increase is also larger than the theoretical maximum for non - redundant ( but non - interacting ) genes , where the increase for the second gap gene would be limited to 1 bit @xcite .",
    "the ability to generate non - monotonic profiles of gene expression ( e.g.  bumps ) is therefore crucial for high information transmissions achieved in the _ drosophila _ gap gene network @xcite .",
    "how much information about position is carried by the four gap genes together ?",
    "figure  [ f16 ] shows the estimation of positional information using mc integration for all four datasets .",
    "the average positional information across four datasets is @xmath226 bits , and this value is highly consistent across the datasets .",
    "notably , the information content in the quadruplet displays a high degree of redundancy : the sum of single - gene positional information values is substantially larger than the information carried by the quadruplet , with the fractional redundancy @xmath227 being @xmath228 .",
    "possible implications of such a redundant representation are addressed in the discussion .    to assess the importance of correlations in the expression profiles and their contribution to the total information , we start with the covariance matrices @xmath121 of the dataset a , which we artificially diagonalize by setting the off - diagonal elements to zero at every @xmath5 .",
    "this manipulation destroys the correlations between the genes , making them conditionally independent ( mechanistically , off - diagonal elements in the covariance matrix could arise as a signature in gene expression noise of the gap gene cross interactions ) .",
    "with these matrices in hand we performed the information estimation using monte carlo integration , analogous to the analysis in fig  [ f16 ] .",
    "surprisingly , we find a minimal increase in information from @xmath229 bits to @xmath230 bits when the correlations are removed .",
    "this indicates that gap gene cross interactions , which are hypothesized to be important for shaping the mean expression profiles by generating bump - like ( as opposed to step - like ) spatial patterns , play a minor role in reshaping the gene expression variability , at least insofar as that influences the total positional information .",
    "we also evaluated the importance of the alignment procedure for estimating total information .",
    "again we use dataset a to recompute the mc information estimates with yt , xy , and xyt alignments , and compare these with the y alignment procedure used in fig  [ f16 ] .",
    "the positional information encoded by the quadruplet is @xmath231 ( for yt ) , @xmath232 ( for xy ) , and @xmath233 ( for xyt ) , respectively .",
    "this shows that the temporal ( t ) alignment does not change the information much , probably because our stringent initial selection cutoff on the depth of the membrane furrow canal has picked out the profiles that are sufficiently localized in time around their stable shapes .",
    "in contrast , x alignment emerges as important , generating an extra half bit of positional information .",
    "this suggests that either our determination of the ap axis used to assign a coordinate to every gene expression has a random embryo - to - embryo error ( which is unlikely given the visual inspection of microscopy images and extracted ap axes ) , or that the gap gene expression pattern is intrinsically variable in that it shifts rigidly from embryo to embryo relative to the egg boundary .",
    "this would imply that correlated readout errors that the nuclei might make are less harmful than uncorrelated errors .",
    "if two neighboring nuclei are positioned both towards the left or both towards the right of the `` true '' pattern with some positional error @xmath102 , this is very different from _ each _ of the nuclei randomly perturbing its position with noise of magnitude @xmath102 : in the first case , the rank order of the nuclear identities is preserved , while in the second case it need nt be , possibly leading to a spatial mixing of the cell fates detrimental to the development process .",
    "positional information is a single aggregate , or global , measure that quantifies the performance of the patterning system , but we can also ask about such performance position - by - position . a local measure based on estimation theory",
    "@xcite is the _ positional error _ , which can be computed from the fisher information of eq  ( [ fisher ] ) .",
    "positional error is the smallest error by which the position can be determined from a local measurement of a set of noisy gene expression levels that is consistent with bayes optimal decision making . as a result , this quantity represents a bound on the precision of any cellular readout as well , and is therefore directly comparable to the measured precision of various positional markers .",
    "we start by looking at a single gene @xmath16 , for which we compute the positional error ( for equally spaced positions along the ap axis ) using eq  ( [ sigmax1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f12 ] illustrates this procedure geometrically for the case of _ hb _ and _ kr_. the positional error at a given @xmath5 can be visualized as follows .",
    "find the mean value of the expression profile at the desired @xmath5 , @xmath14 , and center on it a thin rectangle whose height is equal to the noise in gene expression , @xmath33 at that point .",
    "increase the width of the rectangle and stop when the gap gene profile , @xmath14 , intersects the rectangle in its corners , at which point the width of the rectangle will be roughly @xmath74 ( insets to fig  [ f12]a and c ) . alternatively , this can be seen as propagating the variability in gene expression ( vertical error bar ) to an equivalent error in position ( horizontal error bar ) through the slope of the profile , @xmath234 .",
    "the positional error is plotted as a function of @xmath5 in fig  [ f12]b and c for _ hb _ and _ kr _ , respectively .",
    "an important advantage of using positional error as a local measure of precision in patterning is that it can be naturally generalized to quantify the precision of local position readout using more than one morphogen gradient . in fig",
    "[ f12]e and f we analyze the positional error given the joint readout of the @xmath218 pair .",
    "the results illustrate that the optimal positional decoding performed with several genes ( e.g. , @xmath235 ) at a given @xmath5 does not correspond to the positional error carried by the most informative gene at that position ; the combined error can be smaller than the individual errors due to the noise averaging by the @xmath40 readouts , as well as due to the correlation structure in the variability of the @xmath40 profiles . for 2 genes ,",
    "@xmath102 can be interpreted geometrically as the ap distance between the positions of the intersection points of @xmath14 and a cylinder whose base is the ellipsoid in the @xmath218 plane such that @xmath236_{ij}(g_j(x)-\\bar{g}_j)\\le1/4 $ ] .",
    "figure [ f12 ] shows that by reading out single gap genes the nuclei can already achieve positional errors of less than 1.5% egg length in specific regions of the embryo , yet fail to do so in other regions .",
    "in fact , positional error is seen to be smaller in the regions of high profile slope , where the variations in gene expression are reliably translated into variations in position .",
    "conversely , the error formally diverges at the peaks and troughs of the profiles where small variations in gene expression can not efficiently map to changes in position .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that , when noise is small enough , the positional information is encoded in the parts of the embryo where the morphogens have a large slope , rather than in domains where their expression level is roughly constant .",
    "were the noise much higher , this conclusion would not hold  in that regime one could distinguish solely between , e.g. , a domain of minimal and a domain of maximal expression , and the positional information would correspond better to the intuitive picture of gap genes that define `` on '' and `` off '' domains .    by considering pairs of genes , as in fig  [ f12]e , f , the positional error can be made small across an increasing fraction of the ap axis . finally , using the gap gene quadruplet simultaneously",
    ", the positional error can reach an average value of @xmath237 , while never exceeding a few percent , as shown for all four datasets in fig  [ f14 ] .",
    "this shows that the gap genes establish a convenient `` chemical coordinate system , '' in which it is in principle possible to position any feature along the entire length of the ap axis with roughly one percent precision ; the uniform coverage of the ap axis is a sign of efficient encoding of positional information @xcite . in this regime of operation , the consequences of gene expression variability are truly small and we expect that the approximation to the positional information using positional error , given by eq  ( [ infox ] ) , could hold .    to systematically check if the gene quadruplet system really is within the small noise limit where expressions of eqs  ( [ sigmax1],[poserr],[infox ] ) should hold , we perform the analysis summarized in fig  [ f15 ] .",
    "we systematically scale the measured gene variability in dataset a up or down by a factor @xmath238 to generate synthetic datasets , and compare the positional information computed directly using mc integration on these synthetic data with the approximation of eq  ( [ infox ] ) , computed using the positional error . across the range of @xmath238",
    "( extending from @xmath239 times the observed noise , to @xmath240 times the observed noise ) , the difference between both estimates of positional information is less than 3% . for small @xmath238 ,",
    "the information for the synthetic data ( which is gaussian by construction ) should be equal to the information derived from positional error computed using the full expression for the fisher information given by eq  ( [ fullfi ] ) .",
    "in fact , fig  [ f15 ] shows that simple approximations to the fisher information leading to eqs  ( [ sigmax1],[poserr ] ) are sufficient for a very good match .",
    "even when the noise is increased for @xmath241 , the approximation remains surprisingly good .",
    "the agreement between the monte carlo estimate of positional information with its approximation based on positional error , observed in a controlled setting of fig  [ f15 ] , is reflected in the analogous comparison on the real data highlighted in fig  [ f16 ] . here",
    "the monte carlo estimate is by about 0.1 bits larger than the estimate from positional error , corresponding to a relative difference of roughly @xmath242 , and formally still within the error bars of both estimates .",
    "both analyses suggest that the gap gene quadruplet truly is in the small noise regime ( note that this might not be true for single genes or gene pairs ) , and that tractable approximations to positional information are therefore available .",
    "to generate a differentiated body plan during the development of a multicellular organism , cells with identical genetic material need to reproducibly acquire distinct cell fates depending on their position in the embryo .",
    "the mechanisms of establishment and acquisition of such `` positional information '' have been widely studied , but the concept of positional information itself has , surprisingly , eluded formal definition . here",
    "we have provided a mathematical framework for positional information and positional error based on information theory .",
    "these are principled measures for quantifying how much knowledge cells can gain about their absolute location in the embryo  and thus how precisely they can commit to correct cell fates  by locally reading out noisy gene expression profiles of ( possibly multiple ) morphogen gradients . from this broad perspective , our framework is a mathematical realization of the classic ideas put forth by wolpert almost fifty years ago @xcite .    to illustrate such an approach",
    ", we applied the framework of mutual information to the system of the four major gap genes ( knirps , krppel , giant , and hunchback ) that carry information about the nuclear positions of the central @xmath243 of the major axis of the _ drosophila _ embryo , a short report of which has been published recently @xcite .",
    "our goal here was to provide a detailed account of the corresponding mathematical developments with a focus on the technical aspects of the analyses , which we extended to facilitate wider applicability to other patterning systems .",
    "lastly , we are reporting on previously unpublished datasets ( b , c , d ) in the gap gene system that demonstrate consistency of our estimates across independently performed experiments .",
    "an information - theoretic formulation of positional information has a number of very attractive features .",
    "first , it is mechanism independent .",
    "many plausible mechanisms exist for the establishment of spatial gene expression patterns , involving the processes of gene regulation , signaling , diffusion , controlled degradation etc .",
    "however , the only quantities that matters for positional information are the shapes and co - variabilities of the expression profiles .",
    "this is particularly intriguing as the mechanisms _ establishing _ the gene expression patterns should naturally involve spatial coupling . for example , gene products diffuse across several nuclear distances in the early fly embryo @xcite .",
    "the spatial aspect of the problem would seemingly suggest that our definition of positional information which considers gene expression locally  separately at each spatial location @xmath5is somehow insufficient or incomplete .",
    "however , irrespective of the type of non - local spatial coupling , what ultimately matters for positional information is the final pattern at the local scale , where nuclei make decisions , which is consistent with wolpert s original idea .",
    "conceptually we have provided a clear distinction between the mechanistic processes that generate expression profiles and the positional information that these profiles carry , and we hope that this separation will positively contribute to subsequent discussions in the field .",
    "the second feature is that our definition of positional information is a priori free of assumptions of what specific geometric features of the expression profiles  boundaries , domains , slopes , etc.``carry '' or encode the information .",
    "much prior work has focused on the sharpness of an expression boundary as a proxy for positional information @xcite .",
    "it is unclear , however , how to generalize this approach to systems with more than one expression boundary , and , even more profoundly , we show that the boundary sharpness is _ not _ the feature that actually maximizes positional information .",
    "in contrast , information - theoretic framework makes it clear in what particular way profile shapes and their ( co-)variabilities need to be combined into an appropriate measure of positional information . this measure , as well as the associated positional error , easily generalize to patterning systems with an arbitrary number of gene gradients .",
    "lastly , the third feature is that positional information inherits all the attractive features of mutual information .",
    "the numerical value of mutual information can be interpreted in terms of the number of distinguishable states , or , in the developmental context , as the number of distinguishable positions and cell fates .",
    "mutual information is reparametrization invariant , that is , its value does not depend on what units , or what scale , e.g. , log vs linear , the expression levels are measured on . to estimate the information ,",
    "carefully worked out estimation procedures exist and can be adapted to the developmental context .",
    "lastly , as additional experimental variability can only decrease the information , the computed values will always be conservative lower bound estimates of the true information ; that is , as we learn about the experimental sources of variability ( and remove them , either by designing better experiments or improving data processing / normalization ) , we should be getting increasing estimates for positional information that approach the true , biologically relevant , value .",
    "methodologically , we have hopefully provided enough detail to make this framework applicable to different systems and experimental setups . in particular , we have shown how data can be aligned and normalized if necessary , how different partial stainings can be merged into a consistent dataset , and how analysis methods , including inference from data , numerical computation , and information estimation , should be performed on real experimental data .",
    "importantly , we have proposed how information can be estimated in the small noise regime ( which is likely applicable in different systems ) , and how the consistency of these estimates can be validated .",
    "a major shortcoming of the proposed analysis framework is in assuming that positional information is represented in steady - state expression patterns in a particular time window . in the gap gene system ,",
    "the expression patterns are dynamic on the time scale of nuclear cycles . while they appear most stable in the nuclear cycle 14 and in the particular time class we chose for our analysis , whether or not that constitutes a true steady state",
    "has been debated @xcite .",
    "there exist other systems , e.g. , the segmentation clock in vertebrate somite formation , which are intrinsically dynamic . while it is possible that positional information in all of these systems is encoded in the expression levels in particular time windows , it is ( at least in principle ) also possible that the positional information is encoded in full gene expression _ trajectories _ ,",
    "i.e. , temporal sequences of gene expression levels . extending the information - theoretic approach presented here to include",
    "the temporal aspect is an important future research direction .",
    "the application of our methods to the _ drosophila _ gap gene system has generated several results beyond those reported in ref  @xcite which we would like to highlight .",
    "first , the results are extremely consistent across 4 different datasets , with fractional std in information estimates of below 5% .",
    "this scatter is comparable to the estimation errors on single datasets , indicating the extremely high biological reproducibility in the observed system , as well as very stringent control over the experiment and data analysis .",
    "second , the analysis of positional error shows that positional information is encoded in the parts of the expression profile that have high slopes ( spatial derivatives ) , further weakening the interpretation of gap genes as providing sharp boundaries between expression domains .",
    "third , we find that at the level of gene quadruplet , the information is represented very redundantly . while beyond the scope of this paper",
    ", this suggests a very attractive interpretation where this redundancy could be used for robustness to different external perturbations , by allowing a measure of `` error correction '' in the down stream layer @xcite .",
    "for example , particular gap gene readout mechanisms could respond by choosing correct cell fate assignments not only to wild - type gap gene expression patterns , but also to certain other patterns generated by genetic or environmental perturbations .",
    "finally , the difference between information estimates with and without x alignment implies that a noticeable fraction of biological variability across the embryos consists of rigid shifts of the full gap gene expression pattern along the ap axis .",
    "this could suggest that the biological system cares less about the absolute position of each nucleus in the embryo , and more about their relative positions ( i.e. , order along the ap axis ) .",
    "in other words , certain types of correlated positional errors ",
    "where all nuclei collectively shift left or right  would be less harmful than others , because the in one scenario the ordering of the cell fates would be preserved , while in the other it would be randomly reshuffled .",
    "this is a topic of our future research .",
    "a major shortcoming of the current experiments is their restriction to extracting expression profiles from below the dorsal embryo surface .",
    "the resulting analyses  including this one  therefore confound the expression levels of neighboring nuclei with the levels in the interstitial cytoplasmic space , while biologically meaningful levels are only the nuclear ones . ideally a data set would contain expression levels on a nucleus - by - nucleus basis @xcite , possibly encompassing all nuclei in 3d reconstructed embryos @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that all our analysis methods presented here can be easily extended and applied to data sets containing discrete nuclear expression levels .",
    "the emphasis here and in the associated experimental paper @xcite was on a careful assessment of systematic measurement errors and on achieving a throughput of @xmath244 embryos per data set , necessary for computing the covariance across genes and embryos .",
    "the current experimental setups were feasible for these goals , but this would have to be reassessed for nuclear and 3d data sets .",
