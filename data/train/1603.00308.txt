    "the standard model extension ( sme ) is a framework that incorporates lorentz- and cpt - violating effects into the standard model @xcite . of particular interest is the pure gauge sector , where lorentz violation can be introduced , either while preserving cpt or violating it .",
    "covariant quantization is extremely useful in performing quantum - field - theoretic calculations as the formulas retain explicit covariance throughout the computational procedure . in a previous work",
    "we discussed how this can be implemented for the cpt - preserving case @xcite , where it turned out that a consistent quantization requires the introduction of a mass regulator . in this work",
    "we extend the techniques developed in that work to the cpt - violating case , which is implemented using a chern - simons - like term parametrized by a fixed background vector @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this term has received intensive attention in the literature as it can arise as a radiative correction from the fermion sector in the presence of an axial vector term @xcite .",
    "while quantization of maxwell - chern - simons theory has been addressed before in the literature @xcite , attention was restricted to the ( massless ) case of purely spacelike @xmath0 in axial gauge .",
    "a situation of physical interest is that of vacuum cherenkov radiation . this has been studied before , but for the case of spacelike @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , there has been recent work on the case of purely timelike @xmath0 , in the context of classical maxwell - chern - simons theory @xcite . as an application of the formalism developed in this work",
    "we will calculate the cherenkov radiation rate in field theory at tree level .",
    "an argument could be made that these cpt - violating effects in the photon sector are irrelevant , because they are bounded observationally to minute levels @xcite .",
    "we take the point of view that it is important as a matter of principle to establish whether these effects impede a rigorous quantization , and if not , in what way the standard procedures have to be modified . also , while cpt - violating effects are strongly bounded in the photon sector , this is not at all the case in the gluon sector .",
    "( of course we are dealing here with the non - abelian case , but nevertheless the photon case , if not directly applicable , may offer important lessons there as well . )    as referred to above , a central element of our construction is the introduction of a nonzero photon mass . as it turns out , the ultra - tight observational bound on @xmath0 is actually many orders of magnitude below the bound on the photon mass , making it actually natural to allow for a nonzero value . in the case of timelike @xmath0 , it is not possible to take the massless limit in a consistent way . for spacelike values ,",
    "the massless limit is possible .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case the introduction of a photon mass is a useful way to regulate infrared divergences that occur in loop diagrams , also in the context of lorentz - violating effects @xcite .",
    "we note that the introduction of a photon mass in the context of the sme has been studied in the presence of both cpt - preserving and cpt - violating terms at the level of the equations of motion and the propagator @xcite .    in section  [ eigenvectors ]",
    ", we analyze the equations of motions in momentum space , and show that for the case of timelike @xmath0 the introduction of a nonzero mass parameter avoids a region of momentum space with imaginary energies .",
    "we set up a covariant basis of polarization vectors that solve the momentum space equations of motions , and satisfy a modified orthogonality condition . in section  [ orthogonality ] , an orthogonality relation is derived for the eigenvectors , that is used to define a consistent normalization . the field operator is then quantized in terms of creation and annihilation operators in section  [ quantization ] . in section  [ vacuum - cerenkov ]",
    ", we work out the rate of cherenkov radiation at tree level for the case of purely timelike @xmath0",
    ". finally we present our conclusions .",
    "cpt violation in the photon sector of the minimal sme is given by the lagrangian @xmath1 where @xmath0 is an arbitrary fixed background vector . as is well known @xcite , for timelike @xmath0 the dispersion relation following from ( [ l - massless ] )",
    "has a tachyonic character : there is no covariant separation between positive and negative energy states and there are ( low ) momenta for which there are no corresponding real solutions for the energy , signaling an unstable theory that does not permit a consistent quantization .    as was noted first in @xcite , a way around this problem",
    "is to introduce a small mass term for the photon through the stckelberg mechanism .",
    "the photon lagrangian becomes @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a gauge parameter .",
    "the equation of motion following from ( [ lagrangian - a ] ) is @xmath4 e^{(\\lambda)}_\\beta(\\vec p)=0 \\label{eom}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 are the eigenvectors , which we will take to be a function of the spacelike three momentum . the full dispersion relation can be written @xmath6",
    "\\label{dispersion - relation}\\ ] ] we see that there is an unphysical , gauge - dependent mode satisfying the dispersion relation @xmath7 and a physical mode with the conventional dispersion relation which we will denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "they can be constructed from @xmath10 and @xmath0 subspace . for @xmath11 , it is straightforward to check that @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are normalization constants .",
    "we see that @xmath8 is always timelike , while @xmath9 is generally spacelike .    the two remaining , physical modes ( denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) which satisfy the perturbed dispersion relation are spacelike and generally exhibit birefringent behavior .    in this work",
    "we will assume that @xmath0 is timelike .",
    "we can then always choose an observer frame in which @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the perturbed energies become @xmath19 where we defined the momentum - dependent quantities @xmath20 we see from ( [ timelike ] ) that problems arise when @xmath21 are similar in magnitude . in fact",
    ", it can be easily seen that @xmath22 are always non - negative provided @xmath23 . from now on",
    ", we will assume this to be the case .",
    "an explicit expression for the modes @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 are normalization constants .",
    "note that this expression is indeterminate when @xmath27 , in which case an alternative expression can be easily found .",
    "it is interesting to compare the current experimental bounds on these parameters .",
    "the mass of the photon can be bounded through examination of large - scale magnetic fields which would be have a perturbed structure if the photon had a significant mass .",
    "the particle data group quotes @xmath28 it may be possible to improve on this bound by nine orders of magnitude or so by verifying certain properties of galactic magnetic fields , but this result is still many orders of magnitude from the best bounds on @xmath29 @xmath30 from cosmological searches for birefringence @xcite .",
    "this implies that if one wants to construct a phenomenologically viable model for photons with cpt - violation , it is possible to assume a nonzero mass that would be entirely consistent with experimental observations .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ timelike ] ) that one of the perturbed dispersion relations implies spacelike four - momenta , while the other involves superluminal propagation , for sufficiently large values of @xmath31 .",
    "this fact is well known in the literature @xcite .",

    "the purely timelike case was considered very recently on the level of the classical equations of motion @xcite , with the conclusion that the radiation rate is exactly zero .",

    "we find @xmath74 using ( [ spin - sum1 ] ) , ( [ qqee ] ) , ( [ minus - norm ] ) , as well as the orthogonality relation @xmath75",
    "it then follows @xmath76 using this result in ( [ radiation - rate1 ] ) and introducing spherical coordinates @xmath77 one finds @xmath78 where @xmath79 the limits @xmath80 in the integral over @xmath81 arise because the integral over @xmath70 in the second identity of ( [ radiation - rate2 ] ) requires that the delta - function representing energy conservation be satisfied for some value of @xmath70 .",
    "note also that the square root in the second term of ( [ p_max - min ] ) imposes that its argument be non - negative .",

    "it is interesting that the ( quadratic and linear ) dependences on @xmath94 in these regimes have analogues in the case of spacelike @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "our work begins with the introduction of a nonzero mass which insures well - defined real energies , and , as we have shown , results in an observable physical effect : the rate of cherenkov radiation for purely timelike @xmath0 is nonzero .",
    "the literature includes attempts to treat the case of a massless photon and the associated difficulties involving imaginary energies @xcite . in particular , the predictions involving the rate of cherenkov radiation differ from the nonzero mass case .",
