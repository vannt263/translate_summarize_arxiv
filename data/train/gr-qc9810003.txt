    "consider einstein s non - covariant first - order action@xcite , the 4-integral of a `` bulk '' lagrangian which is quadratic in the christoffel symbols and thus often called the `` @xmath12 action . ''",
    "starting with the einstein action , one applies standard techniques associated with noether s theorem in order to derive , among other things , an energy definition in general relativity : namely , the 2-integral of an einstein superpotential over some generic 2-surface @xmath13 in spacetime @xmath14 .",
    "the einstein energy is well known to be ambiguously defined because it depends on the choice of background coordinates .",
    "nevertheless , one may use the einstein construction to define sensible notions of total gravitational energy . indeed , consider the scenario of asymptotic flatness , say , towards future null infinity @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", @xmath13 tends to a round , infinite - radius , 2-sphere cut of @xmath15 , and the ( now suitably unique ) choice of asymptotically cartesian coordinates ensures that the einstein energy agrees with the accepted trautman - bondi - sachs ( tbs ) notion of total energy.@xcite however , were we to offer the einstein definition as the energy contained within some _ quasilocal _ ( that is , finite ) 2-surface @xmath13 , we would still be confronted with the task of choosing a physically meaningful set of background coordinates",
    ". the only natural choice would be coordinates which are partially adapted to the embedding of @xmath16 .",
    "however , such a choice wrecks the agreement between the einstein and tbs energies as @xmath13 tends towards @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , choosing such @xmath13-adapted coordinates , one finds that the einstein energy blows up in the said limit .",
    "similar statements can be made regarding other approaches for defining energy , which trade coordinate ( that is , holonomic - frame ) ambiguity for ambiguity of a different stripe , e.  g.  tetrad ( or rigid ) frame , spin frame , or auxiliary vector ( or spinor ) fields .",
    "the traditional party line regarding these issues is the following : _ there is no over - arching rule , applicable for all quasilocal 2-surfaces , for selecting a ( suitably unique ) background frame _ ; whence gravitational quasilocal energy is not well - defined .",
    "to what extent does the stubborn presence of frame ambiguity in the quasilocal context point to a gap in our understanding of gravitational energy ? to address this question and sharpen our thoughts on these issues , let us consider a covariant version of the einstein construction .    employing a straightforward field - theoretic generalization of the hamilton - jacobi ( hj ) method@xcite",
    ", one may derive from a covariant action functional an expression for canonical quasilocal energy ( qle ) in general relativity.@xcite we call this definition of qle _ canonical _ , because , owing to its intimate connection with hj theory , this qle is also the on - shell value of the gravitational hamiltonian for the choice of unit lapse function and vanishing shift vector at the system boundary.@xcite we also note that the canonical qle is the thermodynamic internal energy in a thermodynamical description of a ( relativistic ) self - gravitating system.@xcite the analysis that leads to the canonical qle runs along a somewhat different line than the one followed in a noether - type analysis , but it also leads to a concept of energy which is not unique .",
    "indeed , _ as is always the case with energy _ , the canonical qle is defined only up to the choice of a zero - point .",
    "the zero - point ambiguity may be traced to a freedom present in the action principle .",
    "namely , one may always add to the action any functional of the fixed boundary data without affecting the variational principle .",
    "as with the situation above , if the goal is to obtain agreement with the accepted notions of gravitational energy at spacelike or null infinity , then there is a suitably unique choice of energy zero - point@xcite , whereas at the quasilocal level there seems to be no preferred choice .- adapted coordinates for the einstein definition .",
    "like before , such a choice , leading to an infinite energy , wrecks the agreement between the canonical quasilocal and tbs energies in the large - sphere null limit . ]",
    "while at first sight this seems no better or worse than the situation encountered above , notice that now the ambiguity in the energy has a physical interpretation , and , moreover , is a field - theoretic generalization of the standard ambiguity present in the hj definition of energy in ordinary mechanics .",
    "we may now restate the emphasized portion of the party line above as follows : _ there is no over - arching rule , applicable for all quasilocal 2-surfaces , for selecting a ( suitably unique ) zero - point . _ taking this statement at face value , we claim that it is the physicist s job to select an appropriate energy zero - point , guided by the principle that the selection should be appropriate for the physics of the problem at hand .",
    "we would like to point out that this is a common enough state of affairs in general relativity , a many - faceted theory known for its wealth of possible boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , by way of analogy consider the search for solutions of the einstein field equations . in practice , relativists certainly do not attempt to find _ the _ general solution , rather they attempt to find solutions given some additional physical input ( boundary conditions , symmetries , etc . ) . in practice",
    ", the same such additional input is needed to associate a meaningful qle with a particular quasilocal 2-surface .    bearing these points in mind , we recall the form of the canonical qle : @xmath17 where we adopt geometrical units ( in which both newton s constant and the speed of light are set to unity ) , @xmath13 is a closed 2-surface , @xmath18 is the proper area element on @xmath13 , and @xmath19 is the mean curvature of @xmath13 as embedded in a spanning 3-surface @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to realize that this @xmath0 , while obtained as a proper surface integral over @xmath13 , is the energy of the gravitational and matter fields which live on @xmath5 , that is to say , @xmath0 is a functional of the initial data of @xmath5 .",
    "this concept of energy is rooted in the @xmath20 view of spacetime geometry , and for a fixed @xmath13 it is slightly sensitive to the choice of spanning @xmath5 .",
    "[ more precisely , @xmath0 depends on the equivalence class of spanning 3-surfaces determined by a unit timelike vector on ( and pointing orthogonal to ) @xmath13 . ]",
    "this sensitivity is quite analogous to the observer dependence of energy in special relativity , and _ a priori _ we expect its presence.@xcite in general , the term @xmath21 represents an arbitrary ( local ) function of the intrinsic metric @xmath22 of @xmath13 and corresponds to the freedom to assign the qle zero - point . notice that this freedom corresponds to a proper surface integral of what is effectively a free function of two variables .",
    "this freedom , stemming from the field - theoretic character of gravity , is rather more subtle than the freedom in simple mechanics of simply adding a constant to the energy . for our analysis here",
    "we only consider two energy zero - points , one determined by _",
    "lightcone reference _ and the other by _",
    "euclidean reference_. we make these concepts precise below .    in this paper",
    "we examine the canonical qle in the standard `` small - sphere limit , '' first considered by horowitz and schmidt in their classic examination of hawking s quasilocal mass . by the term _ small sphere _",
    "we mean a cut @xmath1 , level in an affine radius @xmath2 , of the lightcone @xmath3 belonging to a generic spacetime point @xmath4 . as a power series in @xmath2",
    ", we compute the energy @xmath0 of the gravitational and matter fields on a spacelike hypersurface @xmath5 spanning @xmath1 .",
    "much of our analysis concerns conceptual and technical issues associated with assigning the zero - point of the energy , and , therefore , particularly elucidates the points raised in the first two paragraphs above . for the small - sphere limit , we argue that the correct zero - point is obtained via the aforementioned lightcone reference , which stems from a certain isometric embedding of @xmath1 into a genuine lightcone of minkowski spacetime and amounts to fixing @xmath23\\!{}^{-1}\\right\\ } \\label{lcmeancurvature}\\ ] ] in the above qle definition . here",
    "@xmath24 is the laplacian operator and @xmath25 is twice the gaussian curvature of @xmath1 ; therefore , as advertised , this choice for @xmath26 depends solely on the intrinsic geometry of @xmath1 .",
    "notice that , due to the presence of the square root in this expression , one expects this choice for @xmath26 to be valid only for ( topologically spherical ) 2-surfaces possessing everywhere positive gaussian curvature ( as is the case both for the small spheres we study here ) . choosing the proper surface integral of this choice for @xmath27 as the energy zero - point , we find the following results for small spheres : in the presence of matter @xmath28|_{p }              + { \\rm o}(r^{4 } ) \\label{result_one}\\ ] ] and in vacuo @xmath29|_{p }              + { \\rm o}(r^{6 } ) { \\ , } \\label{result_two}\\ ] ] here , @xmath8 is a unit , future - pointing , timelike vector in the tangent space at @xmath4 ( which defines the choice of affine radius ) ; @xmath9 is the matter stress - energy - momentum tensor ; @xmath10 is the bel - robinson gravitational super stress - energy - momentum tensor ; ] where @xmath30 is the weyl tensor , @xmath31 is the left - dual of the weyl tensor , and @xmath32 is the self - dual @xmath33 [ anti - self - dual @xmath34 part of the weyl tensor .",
    "further curvature conventions are discussed in the appendix . ] and @xmath11 denotes `` restriction to @xmath4 . ''",
    "it is interesting to note that , when integrated , the bel - robinson `` energy '' in ( [ result_two ] ) has been proven to be very useful already in the sense of a mathematical `` energy '' in the study of existence of solutions of hyperbolic equations in einsteinian gravity.@xcite it is noteworthy that it shows up also in the physical limit given in ( [ result_two ] ) .",
    "although the full physical significance of the physical limit is not known to us , we think that these mathematical and physical properties go beyond mere coincidences .",
    "for both the vacuum and non - vacuum cases , hawking s quasilocal mass expression agrees with the canonical qle results ( [ result_one ] ) and ( [ result_two ] ) up to and including the first non - trivial order in the affine radius .",
    "we find this result rather striking in light of the fact that the hawking mass has no apparent connection with the gravitational action or hamiltonian .",
    "we show that the non - vacuum result ( [ result_one ] ) has the expected form based on the results of newtonian potential theory .",
    "compare the small - sphere limit considered here with the large - sphere limit when @xmath1 tends to a cut of @xmath15 , in which case we know that the choice of euclidean reference yields agreement between @xmath0 and the tbs energy.@xcite in both limiting cases , the 2-surface @xmath1 of interest is a cut , level in an affine radius @xmath2 , of an outgoing congruence of null geodesics",
    ". there is , however , a crucial distinction to be made . in the small - sphere case",
    ", @xmath1 arises as the cut of a genuine lightcone , while in the large - sphere case this is generally not true .",
    "we find it remarkable that this distinction can be mirrored in the choice of zero - points .",
    "to grasp this point , consider first the euclidean reference for either limit .",
    "this reference involves an _",
    "embedding of @xmath1 into a flat euclidean 3-space @xmath35 .",
    "now , in both limiting scenarios @xmath1 is , in general , slightly distorted from perfect roundness .",
    "therefore , with @xmath35 viewed in turn as an inertial slice of minkowski space @xmath36 , the enveloped @xmath37 can not be the cut of a genuine lightcone of @xmath36 .",
    "( technically , in this case the outward null congruence associated with @xmath1 is not shear - free , but the lightcones of @xmath36 are shear - free . ) therefore , in the general large - sphere scenario , neither the @xmath1 embedding into the physical spacetime @xmath14 nor its embedding into the reference spacetime @xmath36 corresponds to a lightcone embedding [ that is , in neither case is @xmath1 the cut of a lightcone ] .",
    "of course , for the small - sphere limit we may employ either the euclidean reference or the lightcone reference . of these two choices , the lightcone employs flat _ spacetime _ to put the reference space on an equal footing with the small sphere construction in the physical spacetime . to define the lightcone reference",
    ", we first isometrically embed @xmath1 into the lightcone @xmath38 of a point @xmath39 , and then select a certain 3-surface @xmath40 spanning @xmath1 [ so that @xmath41",
    ". the details of this construction , eventually leading to the expression ( [ lcmeancurvature ] ) , are found in subsection 2.a .",
    "now , having defined the lightcone reference ( tailored to the small sphere limit ) and found the resulting closed - form expression ( [ lcmeancurvature ] ) , we may now invert the question , asking whether or not a lightcone - reference @xmath26 defines a qle ( [ brownyorkqle ] ) possessing a correct large - sphere limit towards @xmath15 .",
    "we discuss this issue in appendix a.    the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 1",
    "we lay the foundations for our examination of the small - sphere limit .",
    "we describe the geometry of the limit in subsection 1.a , fix some general conventions in subsection 1.b , and make some general observations concerning the embedding of a @xmath42-surface in minkowski spacetime in subsection 1.c .",
    "no choice of energy zero - point is made in section 1 , although the results of subsection 1.c are used in the subsequent sections to construct zero - points . in section 2",
    "we study the small - sphere limit , subject to the choice of lightcone reference , and derive the results ( [ result_one ] ) and ( [ result_two ] ) . in section 3",

    "appendix a contains discussions of the small - sphere limit subject to the choice of euclidean reference , and the large - sphere limit towards @xmath15 subject to the choice of lightcone reference .",
    "throughout our analysis , we use the newman - penrose ( np ) formalism@xcite , with which we assume the reader is familiar . in appendix",
