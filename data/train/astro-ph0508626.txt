    "since the discovery of psr b1913 + 16 , the hulse & taylor binary pulsar in 1974 @xcite , seven more double neutron stars ( dns ) have been found .",
    "of all these , five systems are considered  close \" ( or  coalescing \" ) : psrs b1913 + 16 , b1534 + 12  @xcite , b2127 + 11c  @xcite , j17562251  @xcite , j07373039a  @xcite .",
    "three are  wide \" ( will not coalesce in a hubble time ) : psrs j1518 + 4904  @xcite , j18111736  @xcite , j1829 + 2456  @xcite .",
    "a more recently discovered binary pulsar j1906 + 0746  @xcite is another possible close dns , although its nature as such is not yet confirmed .",
    "binaries are characterized as either close or wide depending on their evolutionary timescales .",
    "a dns goes through an inspiral phase and eventually merges because energy is taken away from its orbit in the form of gravitational radiation .",
    "if the time between the birth of the primordial binary and the merger of the resulting dns is less than a hubble time , we consider it to be `` coalescing '' ( close ) , and wide if not .",
    "coalescing dns are of interest to ligo and other ground - based interferometers because dns mergers are primary targets for gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "the relativistic nature of such inspiraling dns make them objects of extreme interest for astrophysics and relativity studies .    of the coalescing dns ,",
    "psr  b212711c is a system with an eccentricity of @xmath2 , located in the globular cluster m15 @xcite .",
    "star formation in the globular cluster stopped long before the birth of the recycled pulsar .",
    "this particular binary was almost certainly created as the result of cluster dymaics .",
    "our calculations in the present paper do not account for dns formation in clusters , and therefore we will not include psr  b212711c in our analysis . although psr  j1906 + 0746 is not yet a confirmed dns , we include it in our analysis as such .",
    ".observed dns binaries [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : lambda ]      the full set of calculated likelihood values for various models are shown in table  [ table : lambda ] .",
    "we note that @xmath3 values are _ not _ normalized , so their absolute values have little meaning .",
    "however it is their comparative values that allow us to address the questions of interest to us : given the observed sample of measured dns eccentricities , ( i ) are the birth or present populations more likely ?",
    "( ii ) which of the ten binary evolution models considered here more likely ?",
    "( iii ) are `` standard '' kick magnitudes or small or zero kicks more likely ? to address each of these questions we examine the likelihood ( or _ odds _ ) ratios for the models relevant in each case and compare these ratios to unity .      to quantitatively compare our results for the present and birth distributions we present the model odds ratios @xmath4 as a function of the binary evolution models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oddspres ] ) .",
    "it is evident that for the majority of the models , the ratios exceed unity often by factors of more than 2 or as high as 20 .",
    "we note that for wide dns the ratio values `` hover '' within a factor of 2 from unity indicating that there is little or insignificant evolution from birth to present for these wide dns binaries ( as already noted in  3.2 ) .",
    "we conclude that the models for coalescing dns provide clear evidence that orbital evolution due to gravitational radiation is important .",
    "when allowed to evolve , the roughly uniform eccentricity distribution at birth shifts to favor lower eccentricities at present .",
    "four of the five coalescing dns inhabit the lower eccentricity part of the distributions , so the shift towards lower eccentricities usually raises the likelihood of present model distributions over those at dns birth .",
    "this is in full agreement with the conclusions reached by @xcite based on a different analysis and arguments . on the other hand the lack of strong bias in favor of the present distributions from the wide dns models",
    "is understood , given their long orbital evolution timescales .",
    "two exceptions to high odds ratios in the coalescing systems appear for models e1 and l2 ( these , respectively , assume very low common - envelope efficiency and large specific angular momentum carried by mass lost from the binary in non - conservative mass transfer phases ) . for model e1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eprescoal ] ) , the eccentricity distribution already favors low @xmath5 at birth , such that when allowed to evolve , much of the dns population possesses @xmath6 , a region where there are no observed dns .",
    "we also see that the probability of seeing dns at @xmath7 actually decreases , contributing to lowering the `` present '' likelihood . in model l2 ,",
    "the odds ratio close to unity is an indication of little evolution with time for the dns formed under l2 assumptions combined with a negligible change in the pdf in the range @xmath7 .",
    "guided by our conclusion that the present distributions are more likely , given the measurements , we compare the present likelihoods of the various binary evolution models to that of the standard model a ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : oddsm ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the majority of the models the ratios are well within a factor of 2 from unity .",
    "there is only one exception and this is model l2 with the assumed high specific angular momentum of mass lost in non - conservative mass transfer : its odds ratios for the coalescing population compared to model a is lower than 0.25 .",
    "we conclude that , given the current size of the sample of measured dns eccentricities , it is not possible to distinguish between binary evolution models ; the great majority of the ones considered here appear quantitatively consistent with the eccentricity measurements , with the sole exception of l2 .",
    "last we examine whether the origin of the low eccentricities is related to unexpectedly low or zero kicks imparted to ns at birth . in table",
    "[ table : lambda ] we list the likelihood values for all ten models and for models with zero or low kick - magnitude distributions at present . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oddszero ] shows the model odds ratios for the zero kicks vs. the arzoumanian kick distribution .    in the case of wide dns",
    "the ratios for most of the models are within or very close to a factor of 2 from unity , with the exception of two models ( g1 and g3 ) .",
    "this could tentatively be used as an argument in favor of the hypothesis of very small ns kicks .",
    "however , it is most interesting to examine the case of coalescing binaries : the likelihood values are _ exactly equal to zero _ , for eight models with zero kicks , for all ten models with kicks drawn from a @xmath8kms@xmath1 maxwellian , and for four models with kicks drawn from a @xmath9kms@xmath1 maxwellian . as a result",
    "all these models are rendered _",
    "highly unlikely_. the reason for these values being identically zero can be traced back to the properties of the hulse - taylor binary psr  b1913 + 16 : it has an eccentricity of 0.617 and all the models above have distributions such that the probability for @xmath10 is identically zero ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ecoal ] ) .",
    "therefore , these models can not allow for the existence of psr  b1913 + 16 , and consequently their likelihood becomes equal to zero .",
    "based on the results for coalescing dns , we conclude that models with vanishingly or moderately small kicks ( @xmath0kms@xmath1 ) are inconsistent with the current observed sample if our assumptions about the masses of exploding stars are correct .",
    "we address the question of the origin of the low eccentricities measured for observed dns binaries ( close and wide ) that has attracted considerable attention in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "we use dns population models and associated predictions for eccentricity distributions along with a bayesian statistical analysis and quantitative comparison with the observed sample . assuming that all model dns binaries can be detected as binary pulsars , we conclude that for the case of close ( coalescing ) dns binaries , models with vanishingly or moderately small kicks ( @xmath0kms@xmath1 ) are inconsistent with the current observed sample ( and specifically the hulse - taylor binary pulsar ) .",
    "we also examine the influence of orbital evolution due to gravitational radiation from the time of dns birth to the present .",
    "we conclude that model distributions of dns eccentricities _ at present _ are significantly more likely , given the observed sample .",
    "our conclusion holds for the great majority of the models examined , unless the birth properties are such that there is very little orbital evolution from birth to the present .",
    "these results are in agreement with the conclusions obtained by @xcite previously based on different methods of analysis .    here",
    ", we focus on just the distributions of eccentricities derived from simulations , since we are just interested in the origin of the low values , and not to explicitly constrain binary evolution model assumptions . in forthcoming papers",
    "we will consider the much broader questions of which binary models are most consistent with the complete set of observed dns properties , such as orbital separations , masses , pulsar ages , in addition to eccentricities .",
    "nevertheless we note that at a qualitative level , the range of orbital separations predicted by the _ startrack _",
    "models for the dns population is @xmath11r@xmath12 for the majority of coalescing dns , in good agreement with the measured values ; distributions of such dns orbital properties from startrack have been published in the past @xcite .",
    "as also noted by @xcite , some fraction of the systems that have high eccentricities at birth actually end up merging very soon after ( the rest of the high - eccentricity systems , evolve to lower eccentricities without necessarily merging completely by the present ) .",
    "as seen it is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmr ] , high eccentricity systems at birth ( @xmath13 ) tend to favor shorter merger times , more so than lower - e dns .",
    "highly eccentric dns have accelerated orbital decay due to strong gravitational wave emission at periastron and due to their early mergers are not likely to be represented in the observed sample ( as is the case for our galaxy ) .",
    "the importance of such short - lived systems has also been pointed out in the past @xcite .",
    "current estimates of galactic dns merger rates ( of interest to ground - based gravitational - wave interferometers like ligo ) are based on the dns observed sample and do not account for this selection effect against high - eccentricity dns with short merger times ( see @xcite and references therein ) . consequently these rate estimates could underestimate the true merger rate by possibly a significant factor .",
    "this issue has in fact pointed out in the past in a somewhat different context ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . to assess the magnitude of this upward correction factor that should in principle be applied to such rate estimates",
    ", we calculate the fraction of dns with merger times ( at birth ) shorter than 1myr and 10myr .",
    "we find that in most models these fractions are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ; for a couple of our extreme models ( c and e1 ) the fractions are @xmath16% for a cut of 10myr .",
    "we conclude that although orbital evolution due to gravitational radiation affects the eccentricity distribution of the observed sample , the associated upwards correction factor to merger rate estimates is rather small ( typically 10 - 40% ) .",
    "this factor is well within the current uncertainties of the dns merger rate estimates for the galaxy .",
