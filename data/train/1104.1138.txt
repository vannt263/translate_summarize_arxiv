    "equilibrium systems with rough free energy landscapes , such as spin glasses , configurational glasses and proteins , are difficult to simulate using conventional monte carlo methods because the simulation tends to be trapped in metastable states and fails to explore the full configuration space .",
    "a number of techniques have been proposed to overcome this problem .",
    "some of these techniques involve simulating an extended state space that includes many temperatures  @xcite .",
    "multicanonical simulations , umbrella sampling , the wang landau method , simulated tempering and parallel tempering all fall into this class .",
    "parallel tempering  @xcite , also known as replica exchange monte carlo , is perhaps the most widely used of these methods because it is simple to program and performs well in many settings .",
    "it is the standard method for simulating spin glasses  @xcite and is used for protein folding  @xcite and lattice gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "parallel tempering and the other members of its class are all markov chain monte carlo methods . in markov",
    "chain monte carlo , the target distribution is approached via repeated application of an elementary process that typically satisfies detailed balance with respect to the target distribution . in the case of parallel tempering ,",
    "the target distribution is a joint distribution whose marginals are equilibrium distributions for a set of temperatures . in sequential monte carlo , by contrast , the target distribution is the last member of a sequence of distributions , each of which is visited once .",
    "the initial distribution is easy to equilibrate and a resampling step transforms one distribution to the next in the sequence .",
    "population annealing  @xcite is a sequential monte carlo algorithm in which the sequence of distributions are equilibrium distributions of decreasing temperature .    in this paper",
    "we will describe both parallel tempering and population annealing and compare their efficiency and convergence properties in the context of a simple , tractable free energy landscape comprised of two wells separated by a high barrier .",
    "although this free energy landscape is highly simplified compared to the landscapes of more realistic models , we believe that it captures some of the essential features of rough free energy landscapes and that the lessons learned from this analysis will be useful in understanding and improving the performance of both parallel tempering and population annealing in realistic settings . in ref .",
    "@xcite we analyzed the performance of parallel tempering for this landscape .",
    "although they are based on quite different strategies , parallel tempering ( pt ) and population annealing ( pa ) share a number of common features .",
    "both are methods that build on a conventional markov chain monte carlo procedure whose stationary distribution is a fixed temperature equilibrium ensemble , such as the metropolis algorithm or glauber dynamics .",
    "we refer to this procedure as the _ equilibrating subroutine_. at sufficiently high temperature the equilibrating subroutine converges rapidly to the equilibrium ensemble .",
    "both pt and pa take advantage of this rapid equilibration at high temperature to accelerate the convergence to equilibrium at lower temperatures .",
    "both pt and pa attempt to transform equilibrium high temperature configurations into equilibrium low temperature configurations through a sequence of temperature steps such that the system remains close to equilibrium . in pt",
    "there is a single replica of the system at each temperature in the sequence , and replicas are allowed to move between temperatures via replica exchange .",
    "these replica exchange moves are carried out with acceptance probabilities that satisfy detailed balance so that the entire set of replicas tends toward equilibrium at their respective temperatures .",
    "population annealing is closely related to simulated annealing  @xcite . in",
    "simulated annealing a single realization of the system is cooled from high to low temperature following an _ annealing schedule_. after each temperature step the system is out of equilibrium and the equilibrating subroutine is used to move it back toward equilibrium .",
    "however , at low temperatures , the equilibrating subroutine is unable to facilitate transitions between different minima of the free energy landscape , and simulated annealing falls out of equilibrium if the weights associated with the free energy minima vary with temperature , as is typically the case .",
    "thus simulated annealing can not be used to sample equilibrium ensembles , and its primary use is to find ground states .",
    "population annealing solves this problem by simultaneously cooling a population of replicas of the system through a sequence of temperatures .",
    "each temperature step is associated with a resampling of the population so that some replicas are copied and other replicas are destroyed in such a way that the replicas are correctly weighted in the colder ensemble . in this way , at least for large populations , the population remains close to equilibrium as the system is cooled .",
    "the resampling step in population annealing is similar to methods used in diffusion monte carlo  @xcite and the  go with the winner \" strategy  @xcite .",
    "sequential monte carlo methods  @xcite , of which population annealing is an example , are not well known in statistical physics but have been widely applied in statistics and finance .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to bring this general method to the attention of computational statistical physicists .",
    "we argue that pa may have an important role to play in simulations of systems with rough free energy landscapes and has some advantages over parallel tempering , especially in situations where a moderately accurate result is required quickly and parallel computing resources are available .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe population annealing in sec .",

    "section [ sec : disc ] concludes the paper with a discussion .",
    "the population annealing algorithm operates on a population of @xmath0 replicas of the system . for disordered spin systems , each replica has the same set of couplings .",
    "the algorithm consists of cooling the population of replicas through an annealing schedule from a high temperature , where equilibrium states are easily sampled , to a low target temperature , where the equilibrating subroutine can not by itself feasibly equilibrate the system .",
    "the annealing schedule is defined by a set of @xmath1 inverse temperatures , @xmath2 the highest temperature , @xmath3 , is chosen to be a temperature for which it is easy to equilibrate the system .",
    "it is often convenient to choose @xmath4 as this facilitates the calculation of the absolute free energy of the system at each temperature in the annealing schedule .    in each temperature",
    "step the population is resampled and the equilibrating subroutine is applied to every replica at the new temperature .",

    "thus , the expected number of copies of replica @xmath7 that appear in the resampled population at @xmath6 is @xmath10}{{q}({\\beta},{\\beta^\\prime})},\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the normalization given by @xmath12}{r } .\\ ] ]    the new population of replicas is generated by resampling the original population such that the expected number of copies of replica @xmath7 is @xmath13 .",
    "the actual number of copies @xmath14 of each replica in the new population is given by the multinomial distribution @xmath15 $ ] for @xmath0 trials .",
    "in this implementation the population size is fixed .",
    "other valid resampling methods are available .",
    "for example , the number of copies of replica @xmath7 can be chosen as a poisson random variable with mean proportional to @xmath16 , in which case the population size fluctuates  @xcite .    for large @xmath0 and small @xmath17 ,",
    "the resampled distribution is close to an equilibrium ensemble at the new temperature , @xmath6 .",
    "however , the regions of the equilibrium distribution for @xmath6 that differ significantly from the equilibrium distribution for @xmath5 are not well sampled , leading to biases in the population at @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , due to resampling , the replicas are no longer independent . to mitigate both of these problem ,",
    "the equilibrating subroutine is now applied .",
    "finally , observables are measured by averaging over the population .",
    "the entire algorithm consists of @xmath18 steps : in step @xmath19 the temperature is lowered from @xmath20 to @xmath21 via resampling followed by the application of the equilibrating subroutine and data collection at temperature @xmath21 .",
    "population annealing permits one to estimate free energy differences .",
    "if the annealing schedule begins at infinite temperature corresponding to @xmath22 , then it yields an estimate of the absolute free energy @xmath23 at every temperature in the annealing schedule .",
    "the following calculation shows that the normalization factor @xmath24 is an estimator of the ratio of the partition functions at the two temperatures : @xmath25 the summation over @xmath26 is a sum over the microstates of the system while the sum over @xmath27 is a sum over the population of replicas in pa .",

    "the equilibrating subroutine operates on each replica at its respective temperature .",

    "[ eq : repbb ] .",
    "diffusion of replicas in temperature space allows round trips from low to high temperature and back .",
    "the benefit of these roundtrips is that free energy barriers are crossed in a time that grows as a power of the barrier height  @xcite rather than exponentially with respect to the barrier height as is the case for most single temperature dynamics .",
    "optimization schemes for pt depend in part on adjusting parameters to maximize the rate of making roundtrips  @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe a simple free energy landscape with two minima such as occurs , for example , in the low temperature phase of the ising model or @xmath45 field theories .",

    "we have seen that both parallel tempering and population annealing are able to solve the problem of sampling equilibrium states of systems having several minima in the free energy landscape separated by high barriers .",
    "parallel tempering is a markov chain monte carlo method and thus converges to equilibrium exponentially in the number of sweeps , whereas population annealing converges inversely in the population size .",
    "their relative efficiencies are described qualitatively by the parable of the tortoise and the hare . for a given amount of computational work ,",
    "the hare ( population annealing ) is initially closer to equilibrium but ultimately the tortoise ( parallel tempering ) catches up and gets ahead .",
    "the problem of high barriers between different free energy minima is only one of the difficulties encountered in simulating systems with rough free energy landscapes .",
    "a second , generic problem is that the relevant free energy minima may have small basins of attraction so that when the system is annealed starting from high temperature , it is very unlikely that the relevant low temperature states will be found .",
    "small basins of attraction occur for first order transitions and for np - hard combinatorial optimization problems and are almost certainly a feature of the low temperature phase of spin glasses .",
    "in this situation a very large number of sweeps of parallel tempering or a very large population size in population annealing are required simply to find the relevant states .",
    "parallel tempering is widely used in several areas of computational physics while population annealing is not well known .",
    "one of the conclusions of this paper is that population annealing is an attractive alternative to parallel tempering for studies where moderately accurate answers are required quickly .",
    "this is especially the case if massively parallel computing resources are available since population annealing is well suited to parallelization ."
