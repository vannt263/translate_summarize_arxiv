    "photonic lattices , i.e. , effective periodic potentials created by the interference of counter - propagating laser beams in quasi - linear modes , provide for a powerful tool for the study of nonlinear dynamics in other , nonlinear , modes in the same media .",
    "a well - known example is a photonic lattice in a photorefractive medium , where the beams launched in the ordinary polarization are nearly linear , while the bias electric field applied to the crystal makes the orthogonal extraordinary polarization strongly nonlinear .",
    "this technique has made it possible to predict @xcite and create @xcite various one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) lattice solitons , including localized vortices @xcite , in the extraordinary polarization , supported by a harmonic photonic lattice in the ordinary one .",
    "another physically significant example is provided by solitons in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , that were predicted in the presence of optical lattices ( ols ) created by laser beams illuminating the condensate ( while the mean - field dynamics of the bec wave function is nonlinear due to effects of collisions between atoms , the medium is completely linear for the optical beams ) . in particular , 2d @xcite-@xcite and 3d @xcite ols were shown to stabilize solitons in becs with attractive interactions between atoms @xcite-@xcite ( without the lattice , the corresponding soliton solutions exist too , but they are unstable against the spatiotemporal collapse @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that low - dimensional ols , i.e. , 1d and 2d lattice in the 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite  case , respectively , can also stabilize fully localized multi - dimensional solitons , giving them the freedom to move in the unrestricted directions and thus collide @xcite .",
    "a related result is the demonstration of the stability of 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite solitons in the models with a cylindrical ol , that can be induced by a diffraction - free bessel beam ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if inter - atomic interactions in the bec are repulsive ( which is the most common case @xcite ) , solitons can not exist in the free space , but they can be created and supported , in the form of _ gap solitons _ , by the periodic ol potential @xcite .",
    "the 1d gap solitons have been recently observed in the @xmath0rb condensate @xcite . besides the fundamental solitons of the gap type , stable vortical solitons",
    "have also been predicted in the 2d self - repulsive becs trapped in the square ol @xcite .",
    "another mechanism which is was theoretically shown to be an effective tool for the stabilization of 2d solitons in becs ( but not of their 3d counterparts ) is periodic temporal modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient , which is possible through the _ ac feshbach resonance_. in this case , external magnetic field alters the scattering length ( sl )  of the atomic collisions , and the application of the ac field can periodically change the sign of the interaction .",
    "this mechanism is the basis of the so - called feshbach - resonance - management ( frm ) technique @xcite ( which may be regarded as an implementation of a general concept of the _ nonlinearity management _ ) . a possibility to employ the frm for the stabilization of 2d solitons  in principle , without any trapping field  has been recently demonstrated @xcite ( in fact , this mechanism follows the pattern of the one proposed earlier for the stabilization of cylindrical optical solitons in a layered medium with the periodically alternating sign of the kerr coefficient @xcite ) .",
    "it is also relevant to mention that , while the 1d ol , unlike its 2d and 3d counterparts , can not stabilize 3d solitons @xcite , and the frm technique per se does not make it possible either , a combination of the frm and _ one - dimensional _ ol readily stabilizes single- and multi - peaked solitons in the 3d space @xcite .",
    "thus , two distinct kinds of solitons are possible in becs , under stationary conditions : ordinary ones in the case of self - attraction , and gap solitons in the case of repulsion .",
    "the ol is necessary for the existence of the gap solitons in any dimension , and for the stability of the ordinary ones , except for the 1d case , where ordinary solitons are stable without the lattice ( only in this case ordinary solitons have been already observed in the experiment @xcite ) .",
    "solitons of the two kinds differ not only by their existence and stability conditions , but also in the shape : ordinary solitons normally have a single - peak structure without zeros , while the gap solitons feature oscillatory tails with many zero - crossings .",
    "the possibility of the application of the above - mentioned frm technique suggests to consider a ",
    "mixed \" situation , when the sign of the nonlinearity periodically changes between the attraction and repulsion . in the case of the high - frequency  management \"",
    ", the application of the averaging method makes this situation tantamount to that in an effective static model @xcite .",
    "however , in the quasi - adiabatic ( low - frequency ) case , one may expect time - periodic alternation between solitons of the two types .",
    "such _ alternate solitons _ , which were not considered before , is the subject of the present work . in particular ,",
    "an issue is whether they are able to survive periodic passage of the zero - sl point , as no soliton can exist in the static model without nonlinearity . in this work ,",
    "we chiefly focus on the 2d case , which is the most interesting one ; however , the 1d model is considered too  in particular , with the objective to compare conclusions concerning the stability of alternate solitons in the different dimensions , and the necessary conditions ( _ threshold _ ) for their existence .",
    "besides that , we also consider a more specific issue that was not studied before , viz .",
    ", a possibility to apply the well - known technique of the variational approximation ( va ) @xcite to stationary gap solitons in ols .",
    "nevertheless , the main results reported in this work are based on direct numerical simulations , as the va technique for the alternate solitons in the time - modulated system is too cumbersome .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we formulate the model , including the consideration of its linear spectrum , and present results generated by the va for static 2d gap solitons on the square lattice .",
    "the most essential results for the 2d alternate solitons are reported in section 3 , and respective results for the 1d model are given in section 4 .",
    "the paper is concluded by section 5 .",
    "some technical details of the va are presented in the appendix .",
    "in the mean - field approximation , the evolution of the bec  single - atom wave function @xmath1 in the presence of the 2d square - shaped ol and a tight trap in the transverse ( third ) direction obeys an effective two - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation .",

    "the band structure of the 2d linear equation ( [ operator ] ) constructed this way was already investigated in detail ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "an issue of interest is to find a stable soliton periodically alternating , in the case of the low - frequency modulation , between shapes of both types . in both 2d and 1d cases ,",
    "we have found such _ alternate solitons _ , and identified their stability regions in the @xmath94 plane . as might be expected ,",
    "the stability regions are limited to relatively low frequencies and sufficiently strong ol .",
    "a threshold necessary for the formation of the alternate solitons can be found in the 2d model , and also in its 1d counterpart ( with the zero mean value of the sl ) ; the latter result is especially interesting , as the 1d static models have no threshold .",
    "dynamical regimes of three types were identified : stable , unstable , and semi - stable , the latter one implying that the initial soliton sheds off a conspicuous part of its norm before relaxing into a stable regime . in the 1d case ,",
    "stable antisymmetric alternate solitons were additionally found , while stable vortical solitons were not generated by simulations of the 2d model with the zero average sl .    we have also considered a possibility to apply the variational approximation ( va ) to the description of stationary gap solitons in the 2d model with a constant positive sl ( self - repulsion ) .",
    "we have concluded that the gaussian ansatz very accurately predicts the solitons in the first finite bandgap , and predicts them with a fair accuracy in the second gap . in higher gaps ,",
    "the va actually produces a border between tightly and loosely bound solitons .",
    "we also tried to apply a more sophisticated version of the va , based on the ansatz combining the gaussian and cosines , with the objective to describe the shape of loosely bound 2d gap solitons with oscillatory tails .",
    "it was found that the modified ansatz can correctly describe three central peaks in the soliton s shape .",
