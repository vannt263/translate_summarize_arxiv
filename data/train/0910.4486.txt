    "<S> we present here the first - principles dynamical cpa ( coherent potential approximation ) combined with the tight - binding lmto lda+u method towards quantitative calculations of the electronic structure and magnetism at finite temperatures in transition metals and compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the theory takes into account the single - site dynamical charge and spin fluctuations using the functional integral technique as well as an effective medium . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results for fe , co , and ni show that the theory explains quantitatively the high - temperature properties such as the effective bohr magneton numbers and the excitation spectra in the paramagnetic state , and describes the curie temperatures semiquantitatively .    </S>",
