    "prototype examples of dispersion interactions mediated by the quantum electromagnetic field are the casimir - polder force on a static atom close to a surface @xcite , and the quantum frictional force experienced by the same atom as soon as it starts moving above the surface @xcite . from a theoretical standpoint",
    ", one must often rely on approximations to model such interactions and predict the outcome of a specific experimental setup .",
    "one of these is the markov approximation , which is also one of the most ubiquitous and successful approximations used in quantum optics , and has provided reliable predictions for numerous experimental setups . in casimir physics ,",
    "the markov approximation is often employed to solve the coupled dynamics of the atom and surface interactions mediated by electromagnetic quantum fluctuations .",
    "the key assumption underlying this approximation is that the system s memory can be ignored , i.e. , the future of its dynamics is only related to the immediate present .",
    "more specifically , the logic behind this approximation finds its justification in the fact that sub - systems often exhibit very different correlation times , so that on average the fastest dynamics blurs the evolution of the slower sub - system , effectively erasing its memory @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we argue that the markov approximation fails to provide reliable predictions for non - equilibrium fluctuation - induced interactions .",
    "surprisingly , depending on the targeted level of accuracy , it can already lead to incorrect results for systems in equilibrium .",
    "its failure becomes , however , more relevant as soon as non - equilibrium systems are being considered .",
    "although in some circumstances non - markovian effects are already known to strongly affect the dynamics of quantum systems ( e.g. non - exponential decay of excited quantum states for atoms in photonic crystals @xcite ) , their impact on fluctuation - induced phenomena has not been explored .",
    "moreover , the role and relevance of non - markovian effects in conjunction with non - equilibrium physics , has yet to be thoroughly investigated .",
    "our discussion focuses on the prototypical system consisting of a single atom ( or , in general , a microscopic system with internal degrees of freedom ) interacting with a planar surface ( see figs .",
    "[ cp ] and [ friction ] ) .",
    "besides the large interest of modern experiments in such setups @xcite , e.g. , in thermal radiation and hybrid atom - chip systems , they lend themselves to advanced but still not too complex theoretical treatments .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ static ] we review the theory of equilibrium atom - surface interactions and derive the expression for the casimir - polder force .",
    "the purpose of this part is twofold : on the one hand , it allows for an exposition of the formalism and the basic concepts which will be used in the non - equilibrium case . on the other hand ,",
    "our approach allows for considerations beyond standard perturbative techniques @xcite and the usual lifshitz theory of equilibrium phenomena @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show that long - time tails in the two - time dipole correlation ( and its corresponding low - frequency behavior ) arising from non - markovian effects become relevant as soon as one goes beyond second - order perturbation theory ( see fig .",
    "[ powerspectrumcomp ] ) .",
    "since casimir interactions are a broad - band frequency phenomenon , a precise description of the behavior at low frequencies is fundamental for the evaluation of the interaction .",
    "our final result will formally take into account the general response of the atomic system , and the standard lifshitz formula is obtained as a special case in the linear approximation .",
    "section [ dynamical ] focuses on quantum friction . like ordinary friction",
    ", quantum friction describes a force acting on an object moving near another one ( see fig . [ friction ] ) . unlike the classical case ,",
    "however , quantum friction is mediated by the interaction with the quantum electromagnetic field at zero temperature .",
    "we argue that , as in the static case , non - markovian effects affecting the low - frequency behavior of the dipole correlator are crucial for the correct evaluation of this drag force ( see eq . below ) .",
    "in fact , these effects are responsible for the velocity - dependence of the frictional force .",
    "as we shall demonstrate in this work , it is precisely this sensitivity of quantum friction to the markov approximation that explains the vast zoology of very different results found in the literature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ 2ndorderparagraph ] we discuss quantum friction within lowest - order perturbation theory , and analyze the impact of intrinsic or induced dissipation on the drag force .",
    "let us start by considering the familiar casimir - polder interaction between an atom located at position @xmath0 above a semi - infinite planar medium ( see fig .",
    "[ cp ] ) . within the open quantum system framework",
    ", the resulting dissipation can be thought of as stemming from the interaction of the matter s degrees of freedom with a dissipative bath @xcite . in our description ,",
    "the atom is represented by the dipole operator @xmath1 . for symmetry reasons ,",
    "the force acting on the atom has only a single component along the direction normal to the planar interface ( which we denote as the @xmath2-direction ) . at any given time @xmath3",
    ", it is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electric field operator , @xmath6 is the position of the atom , and the expectation value is taken over the initial state of the system .",
    "this expression for the atom - surface force can be derived from the lorentz force on the atom .",
    "it is important to stress that the time dependence of the operators in eq . is the full time evolution dictated by the total system and , therefore , it includes the effect of the interactions between the different subsystems ( atom , field , and matter ) .        using the maxwell equations , the electric field operator can be written as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 with @xmath9 being some initial time . here",
    ", @xmath10 is the positive - frequency part ( related to the annihilation operators ) of the electromagnetic field in the absence of the atom but in the presence of the dissipative medium , and @xmath11 is the green tensor of the half - space associated with the surface . to derive equation we used the kramers - kronig relations for the green tensor ( see appendix [ maxwellg ] ) .",
    "hereafter we adopt the subscripts `` @xmath12 '' and `` @xmath13 '' to , respectively , indicate the imaginary and the real part of a quantity ( component - wise for tensorial objects ) .",
    "because the dipole and the field ( positive- and negative - frequency parts separately ) operators commute at equal times , by normal ordering we can write @xmath14 the final result can not depend on the ordering we choose , as long as this ordering is consistently used throughout the entire derivation .",
    "however , as will appear in the following , this specific choice of ordering is convenient for our calculations .",
    "physically it has the implication of attributing the force exclusively to the radiation reaction in the atom dynamics @xcite , while the contribution of the vacuum field related to the operator @xmath15 seemingly disappears .",
    "however , this does not mean that the quantum properties @xmath15 are irrelevant : in this approach they are  hidden \" in the expression for the time - dependent dipole operator and they will explicitly appear again when we consider , for example , dipole correlation functions .",
    "for other choices , such as symmetric ordering @xcite , both the dipole and the field itself contribute to the force and the term containing @xmath15 must consistently be kept throughout the calculation .    to evaluate the force ,",
    "let us assume an initially factorized state @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the atom s initial density matrix and @xmath18 represents the state of the coupled field / matter system .",
    "both subsystems are assumed to be initially in their respective ground states , which implies that @xmath19=0 $ ] for all times ( here , the symbol `` @xmath20 '' traces over the quantum states ) .",
    "this means that the contribution coming from the vacuum state of field plus medium subsystem drops out of the calculation .",
    "note that , although both subsystems are initially in their respective ground states , in general , the state @xmath21 _ is not _ the ground state of the composite system @xcite . during the course of the time - evolution ,",
    "the atom subsystem becomes entangled with the field / matter subsystem , undergoing the well - known  dressing \" process @xcite .    using the decomposition in eq . and the symmetry properties of the green tensor , @xmath22 , we can rewrite the atom - surface force as @xmath23\\bigg ) , \\label{source1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where `` @xmath24 '' traces ove tensor indices and we have set @xmath25 .",
    "the tensor @xmath26 is the ( non - symmetrically ordered ) two - time dipole correlator , @xmath27 which plays a key role in what follows .",
    "the coupled equations of motion for the atom and field / matter can be solved ( e.g. numerically or using the born - markov approximation @xcite ) to obtain the dynamic evolution of the two - time dipole correlator and the time - dependent atom - surface force .    a natural question that arises",
    "is whether non - markovian effects are relevant in the dynamics of the dipole correlator and , consequently , in the force @xmath28 . in order to address this question",
    ", we will consider the limit of large times in which the entire system of atom plus field / matter equilibrates and evolves to a stationary state . in this case , the correlator depends only on the time difference @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 represents the stationary density matrix of the full system . in this limit",
    "the atom - surface force reaches the constant value @xmath32 , which should coincide with the expression of the well - known casimir - polder interaction @xcite . in order to evaluate eq.([source1 ] ) for large times , it is convenient to introduce the dipole power spectrum tensor @xmath33 , which is defined in terms of the correlator as @xmath34 as @xmath35 , the power spectrum is hermitian @xmath36 and its real part @xmath37 is a symmetric matrix , while its imaginary part @xmath38 is anti - symmetric . using these properties ,",

    "at large times one can invoke equilibrium considerations to determine the stationary density matrix .",
    "we will assume that the full system thermally equilibrates at an inverse temperature @xmath42 , and that the stationary state is given by a gibbs state @xmath43 where @xmath44 describes the hamiltonian of the full system @xcite , including the couplings between all sub - systems .",
    "in these circumstances , we can appeal to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite .",
    "this theorem of equilibrium thermodynamics establishes a connection between the power spectrum and the linear response of the system to a small external perturbation .",
    "in particular , we will consider the case of zero temperature ( @xmath45 ) , for which the gibbs state is the highly entangled ground state of the full system . in this case , for a non - symmetrized correlator , the fdt takes the form @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the heaviside function , and @xmath48/ ( 2{\\mathrm{i } } ) = \\underline{\\alpha}_{i}^{\\rm s}(\\omega)-{\\mathrm{i}}\\underline{\\alpha}_{r}^{\\rm as}(\\omega)$ ] ( the superscripts `` @xmath49 '' and `` @xmath50 '' indicate the symmetric and the anti - symmetric part of the tensor ) .",
    "further , @xmath51 represents the atom s complex susceptibility ( polarizability ) tensor , i.e. the fourier transform of kubo s formula in the case of linear response , i.e. , @xmath52\\hat{\\rho}(\\infty ) \\ } .\\ ] ] as any susceptibility ( including the green tensor ) , @xmath51 is analytic in the upper part of the complex @xmath53-plane and satisfies the crossing relation @xmath54 .",
    "it follows that the real ( imaginary ) part of the polarizability is an even ( odd ) function of frequency . using these properties in combination with the fdt and the kramers - kronig relations",

    ", we have explicitly indicated the position dependence of the atom s polarizability to stress that the dressing is depending on the system s geometry .",
    "although it is redundant because of the properties of the green tensor , we have also used the superscript `` @xmath49 '' to emphasize that only the symmetric part of the polarizability is relevant for the final result .    as a final remark of this subsection ,",
    "we want to emphasize that , despite certain formal similarities , eq",
    ". differs from standard formulas found in the literature for the atom - surface interaction . indeed ,",
    "eq . contains the exact atomic polarizability , while standard expressions are special cases of this formula , e.g. the lifshitz formula for linear systems @xcite , and perturbative expansions in the atom - field coupling strength @xcite . for further details ,",
    "see appendix [ genericcp ] .      in quantum optics ,",
    "one of the most widely used tools to evaluate two - time correlators is the quantum regression theorem ( qrt ) @xcite .",
    "often considered as the quantum extension of onsager s regression conjecture @xcite , the qrt finds its justification within the framework of master equations . using the born approximation ( which entails the factorization of the density matrix at any time , i.e. , no back - action of the system onto the environment ) , it is possible to show that the regression of fluctuations is identical to the decay of a one - time average @xcite .",
    "in other words , the qrt shows that the equations of motion for the correlations are the same of those for the mean values . very often ,",
    "however , these equations of motion can only be solved by using the markov approximation ( no memory effects ) , thus requiring the validity of the born - markov approximation for applying the qrt .",
    "although the qrt provides expressions for correlators that are more explicit than those in the fdt , the approximations on which it relies limit its validity to the limit of weak atom - field coupling and to a narrow range of frequencies close to a resonance @xcite .    to show how this affects the casimir - polder interaction , we now evaluate the two - time dipole correlation tensor introduced at the beginning of this section using the qrt approach",
    "let us model the atom as a multi - level system , and consider the operators @xmath58 that describe the transition from the atomic level @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "we write the dipole operator as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 denotes the ( real ) dipole vector and @xmath63 is a dimensionless operator describing the quantum dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom . for this operator",
    "we have @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are the matrix elements corresponding to the transition described by @xmath66 .",
