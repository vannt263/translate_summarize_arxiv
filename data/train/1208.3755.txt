    "within condensed matter physics , spintronics has in itself become a strong field for considerable research , owing to not only its potential applications in electronic technologies but also the many fundamental questions that are raised on the physics of electron spin .",
    "@xcite particularly , the spin - orbit interaction recently has strongly attracted the attentions of theoreticians and experimenters since it opens up the possibility of manipulating electron ( or hole ) spin in non - magnetic materials by electrical means .",
    "@xcite since the theoretical prediction of the spin - hall effect , the application of spintronics has seen considerable advancement .",
    "it was shown that the mott - type skew scattering by impurities would result in separation of opposite spin states via the spin - orbit interaction to the impurity atom .",
    "@xcite this is the extrinsic spin - hall effect .",
    "nevertheless , it has been found that in p - type @xcite ( luttinger model ) and n - type @xcite ( rashba model ) semiconductors , the spin - polarized current ( electron or hole ) can be generated by the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction in non - magnetic structure in the absence of impurity scattering , which is called the intrinsic spin - hall effect ( ishc ) .",
    "the calculation of spin - hall conductivity ( shc ) plays a crucial role in studying the spin - hall effect as it can be in comparison with experimental result .",
    "the extrinsic spin - hall effect was experimentally discovered in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) n - type gaas by optical means via spin accumulation at the edges of a sample  @xcite and in two - dimensional ( 2d ) n - type algaas / gaas .",

    "@xcite however , the sign of the theoretical shc is opposite to the experimental value , and it needs to be further clarified .",
    "@xcite in 2d p - type algaas / gaas  @xcite , the experimental value of shc [ @xmath12 also agrees with the theoretical value [ @xmath13 in order of magnitude .",

    "n - type ingan / gan , the strain - dependent intrinsic spin - hall effect detected by optical means is explained in terms of shc in which the strain effect is included .",
    "@xcite in 3d metal pt wire , the large ishc measured electrically throughout the inverse spin - hall effect at room temperature is @xmath14 .  @xcite it was theoretically explained in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the huge berry curvature  @xcite near the fermi level at the l and x symmetry point in the pt brillouin zone ; the obtained theoretical value of ishc is @xmath15 in the absence of impurity scattering .",
    "most recently , a large spin - hall signal is observed at room temperature in fept / au multi - terminal devices .",
    "@xcite    importantly , both the direction of the applied electric field and the strength of the spin - orbit interactions alters the values of the ishc . for the former case , a typical example is the rashba - dresselhaus system .",
    "@xcite when an electric field is applied along the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 $ ] ) ( or @xmath18 @xmath19 $ ] ) direction , we obtain @xmath20 , and these values are equal to the universal constant @xmath8",

    "( [ detbeta ] ) ] is expressed as the effective coupling of the z - component of spin @xmath4 , and orbital angular momentum @xmath5 .",
    "the decoupling of spin and orbital motion associated with the band - overlapping phenomenon results in the vanishing and sign change of the ishc .",
    "furthermore , by analytically calculating the ishc , we find that the unsymmetrical result of the ishc ( @xmath26 ) is governed by the asymmetric response function @xmath7 [ see eq . ( [ deltabeta ] ) ] , which is the difference in band - splitting in two directions : those of the applied electric field and the spin - hall current .",
    "we find that the direction of the applied electric field alters the magnitude of the asymmetric response function .",
    "consequently , we show that there exists a specific direction of applied electric field such that the asymmetric response function reaches a maximum value . in this case , we show that the ishc also reaches a maximum value in the range @xmath8 to @xmath9 , where @xmath9 is the upper bound value of the ishc . the unsymmetrical result and the maximum asymmetric response function of the ishc can also be deduced from the behavior of the berry curvature at the nearly degenerate area .",

    "<S> we analytically calculate the intrinsic spin - hall conductivity ( ishc ) ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) in a clean , two - dimensional system with generic k - linear spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients of the product of the momentum and spin components form a spin - orbit matrix @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the determinant of the spin - orbit matrix @xmath3 describes the effective coupling of the spin @xmath4 and orbital motion @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the decoupling of spin and orbital motion results in a sign change of the ishc and the band - overlapping phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the ishc is in general unsymmetrical ( @xmath6 ) , and it is governed by the asymmetric response function @xmath7 , which is the difference in band - splitting along two directions : those of the applied electric field and the spin - hall current . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained non - vanishing asymmetric response function also implies that the ishc can be larger than @xmath8 , but has an upper bound value of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we will that the unsymmetrical properties of the ishc can also be deduced from the manifestation of the berry curvature at the nearly degenerate area . on the other hand , by investigating the equilibrium spin current , we find that @xmath3 determines the field strength of the su(2 ) non - abelian gauge field . </S>"
