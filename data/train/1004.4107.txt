    "during the last decade a new field on the border between condensed matter physics and atomic physics has emerged .",
    "modern semi - conductor techniques allow fabrication of electron quantum confinement devices , called quantum dots , containing only a small and controllable number of electrons .",
    "the experimental techniques are so refined that one electron at a time can be injected into the dot in a fully controllable way .",
    "this procedure has shown many similarities between quantum dots and atoms , for example the existence of shell structure . to emphasize these similarities quantum dots",
    "are often called artificial atoms .",
    "the interest in quantum dots is mainly motivated by the fact that their properties are tunable through electrostatic gates and external electric and magnetic fields , making these _ designer atoms _ promising candidates for nanotechnological applications .",
    "an additional aspect is that quantum dots provide a new type of targets for many - body methods .",
    "in contrast to atoms they are essentially two - dimensional and their physical size is several orders of magnitude larger than that of atoms , leading e.g. to a much greater sensitivity to magnetic fields .",
    "another difference compared to atoms is the strength of the overall confinement potential relative to that of the electron - electron interaction , which here varies over a much wider range .",
    "the full many - body problem of quantum dots is truly complex .",
    "a dot is formed when a two - dimensional electron gas in an heterostructure layer interface is confined also in the @xmath0plane .",
    "the , for this purpose applied gate voltage , results in a potential well , the form of which is not known .",
    "a quantitative account of this trapping potential is one of the quantum dot many - body problems .",
    "self - consistent solutions of the combined hartree and poisson equations by kumar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the early nineties indicated that for small particle numbers this confining potential is parabolic in shape at least to a first approximation . since then a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential have been the standard choice for studies concentrating on the second many - body problem of quantum dots ; that of the description of the interaction among the confined electrons .",
    "the efforts to give a realistic description of the full physical situation , see e.g.  @xcite have , however , underlined that it is important to realize the limits of this choice . to start with the pure parabolic potential",
    "seems to be considerably less adequate when the number of electrons is approaching twenty .",
    "the potential strength is further not independent of the number of electrons put into the dot , an effect which is sometimes approximately accounted for by decreasing the strength with the inverse square root of the number of electrons  @xcite .",
    "finally , the assumption that the confining potential is truly two - dimensional is certainly an approximation and it will to some extent exaggerate the coulomb repulsion between the electrons . in ref .",
    "@xcite the deviation from the pure two - dimensional situation is shown to effectively take the form of an extra potential term scaling with the fourth power of the distance to the center and which can be both positive and negative .",
    "although the deviation is quite small it is found that predictions concerning the so called third shell can be affected by it .",
    "there is thus a number of uncertainties in the description of quantum dots . on the one hand",
    "there is the degree to which real dots deviate from two - dimensionality and pure parabolic confinement . on the other hand",
    "there is the uncertainty in the account of electron correlation among the confined electrons .",
    "the possible interplay among these uncertainties is also an open question . in a situation like this",
    "it is often an advantage to study one problem at a time , since it is then possible to have control over the approximations made and quantify their effects .",
    "we concentrate here on the problem of dot - electron correlation . for this",
    "we employ a model dot ; truly two - dimensional , with perfect circular symmetry and with a well defined strength of the confining potential .",
    "this choice is sufficient when the aim is to test the effects of the approximations introduced through the approximative treatment of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "especially the experimental study by tarucha et .",
    "@xcite has worked as a catalyst for a vast number of theoretical studies of quantum dots . a review of the theoretical efforts until a few years ago has been given by reimann and manninen  @xcite . a large number of calculations has been done within the framework of density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite and reference therein , but also hartree  fock ( hf )  @xcite , quantum monte carlo methods  @xcite and configuration interaction ( ci )  @xcite studies have been performed .",
    "the dft  studies have been very successful .",
    "the method obviously accounts for a substantial part of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "still , the situation is not completely satisfactory since there is no possibility to systematically improve the calculations or to estimate the size of neglected effects . for just a few electrons the ci - approach can produce virtually exact results , provided of course that the basis set describes the physical space well enough .",
    "the size of the full ci problem grows , however , very fast with the number of electrons and to the best of our knowledge the largest number of electrons in a quantum dot studied with ci is six .",
    "it would be an advantage to also have access to a many - body method which introduces only well defined approximations and which allows a quantitative estimate of neglected contributions .",
    "the long tradition of accurate calculations in atomic physics has shown that many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) has these properties .",
    "it is an in principle exact method , applicable to any number of electrons , and the introduced approximations are precisely defined . with mbpt",
    "it is possible to start from a good , or even reasonable , description of the artificial atom and then refine this starting point in a controlled way .",
    "we are only aware of one study on quantum dots that have been done with mbpt , the one by sloggett and sushkov@xcite .",
    "they did second ",
    "order correlation calculations on circular and elliptical dots in an environment free of external fields .    in the present study",
    "we use second  order perturbation theory to calculate energy spectra for quantum dots with and without external magnetic fields .",
    "we consider this second  order treatment as a first step towards the calculation of correlation to high orders through iterative procedures , an approach commonly used for atoms  @xcite .",
    "the method is described in section  [ sec : method ] . in section  [ sec : validity ] we compare our calculations with experimental results@xcite , dft ",
    "calculations  @xcite and ci  calculations , our own as well as those of reimann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and discuss the strength and limits of the mbpt approach .",
    "we have mainly used the hartree - fock description as starting point for the perturbation expansion , but we also show examples with a few alternative starting points , among them dft . to obtain a complete and finite basis set , well suited to carry out the perturbation expansion , we use so called b - splines , see e.g. ref .  @xcite .",
    "the use of b - splines in atomic physics was pioneered by johnson and sapirstein  @xcite twenty years ago and later it has been the method of choice in a large number of studies as reviewed e.g. in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we compare our correlated results to our own hf  calculations , thereby highlighting the importance of correlation both when the quantum dot is influenced by an external magnetic field and when it is not .",
    "we present addition energy spectra for the first twelve electrons .",
    "the interesting third shell ( electron seven to twelve ) is discussed in section  [ sec : result ] . here",
    "we investigate several different filling sequences and show that correlation effects in many cases can change the order of which the shells are filled .",
    "we note also that the energy of the first excited state can be very close to the ground state , in some case less than 0.1 mev , which raises the question if it is always the ground state which is filled when an additional electron is injected in the dot since more than one state may lie in the transport window controlled by the source drain voltage  @xcite .",
    "the essential point in perturbation theory is to divide the full hamiltonian @xmath1 into a first approximation , @xmath2 , and a correction , @xmath3 .",
    "the first approximation should be easily obtainable , in practice it is more or less always chosen to be an effective one - particle hamiltonian , and it should describe the system well enough to ensure fast and steady convergence of the perturbation expansion .",
    "the partition is written as @xmath4 here we have chosen to mainly use the hartree - fock hamiltonian as @xmath2 but we have also investigated the possibility to use a few other starting points .    a first approximation to the energy is obtained from the expectation value of @xmath1 , calculated with a wave function in the form of a slater determinant formed from eigenstates to @xmath5 .",
    "the result is then subsequently refined through the perturbation expansion .",
    "below we describe the calculations step by step .      for a single particle confined in a circular quantum dot",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath6 where b is an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the dot .",
    "the effective electron mass is denoted with @xmath7 and the effective g - factor with @xmath8 . throughout this work we use @xmath9 and @xmath10 , corresponding to bulk values in gaas .",
    "the single particle wave functions separate in polar coordinates as @xmath11 with coefficients @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 b  splines are piecewise polynomials of a chosen order @xmath14 , defined on a so called knot sequence and they form a complete set in the space defined by the knot sequence and the polynomial order  @xcite . here",
    "we have typically used @xmath15 points in the knot sequence , distributed linearly in the inner region and then exponentially further out .",
    "the last knot , defining the box to which we limit our problem is around 400 nm .",
    "the polynomial order is six and combined with the knot sequence this yield @xmath16 radial basis functions , @xmath17 , for each combination @xmath18 .",
    "the lower energy basis functions are physical states , while the higher ones are determined mainly by the box .",
    "the unphysical higher energy states are , however , still essential for the completeness of the basis set .",

    "( [ matrix_eq ] ) is a generalized eigenvalue problem that can be solved with standard numerical routines .",
    "the integrals in ( [ matrix_eq ] ) are calculated with gaussian quadrature and since b - splines are piecewise polynomials this implies that essentially no numerical error is produced in the integration .",
    "the next step is to allow for several electrons in the dot and then to account for the electron - electron interaction , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the relative dielectric constant which in the following calculations is taken to be @xmath24 corresponding to the bulk value in gaas . for future convenience",

    "al@xcite , the inverse radial distance can be expanded in cylindrical coordinates @xmath29 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 assuming a 2d confinement we set @xmath32 in ( [ chi_eq ] ) .",

    "this is how the degree of the legendre  function in the radial part of ( [ ee_interaction_big_eq ] ) is chosen .",
    "it is also clear from ( [ ee_interaction_big_eq ] ) that the electron  electron matrix element ( [ ee - interaction_eq ] ) equals zero if state @xmath37 and @xmath38 or state @xmath39 and @xmath27 have different spin directions .",
    "if the wave function is restricted to be in the form of a single slater determinant , the hartree - fock approximation can be shown to yield the lowest energy . in this approximation",
    "each electron is governed by the confining potential and an average _ hartree - fock potential _ formed by the other electrons . to account for the latter the hamiltonian matrix @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ matrix_eq ] ) is modified by the addition of a term : @xmath41 the sum here runs over all occupied orbitals , @xmath37 , defined by quantum numbers @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",

    "the hereby obtained solution is often labeled the unrestricted hartree - fock approximation since no extra constraints are imposed on @xmath45 .    one property of the unrestricted hartree  fock approximation deserves special attention .",
    "consider the effects of the hartree - fock potential on an electron in orbital @xmath39 , @xmath46 where the last term in eq .",
    "( [ hforbital ] ) , the exchange term , is non - zero only if orbital @xmath37 and @xmath39 have the same spin . for configurations where",
    "not all electron spins are paired electrons with the same quantum numbers @xmath42 and @xmath43 , but with different spin directions , will experience different potentials .",
    "this is in accordance with the physical situation , but has also an undesired consequence ; the total spin , @xmath47 , does not commute with the hartree - fock hamiltonian .",
    "this means that the state vector constructed as a single slater determinant of hartree ",
    "fock orbitals will not generally be a spin eigenstate .",
    "however , the full hamiltonian , eq .  [ eq : perturb ] , still commutes with @xmath48 and during the perturbation expansion the spin will eventually be restored , provided of course that the perturbation expansion converges . since , in contrast to the energy , the total spin of a state is usually known , the expectation value of the total spin , @xmath49 , can be used as a measure of how converged the perturbation expansion is .",

    "we have in addition to hf investigated three alternative starting points .",
    "if there are important cancellations between the full exchange ( included in hartree - fock ) and correlation ( not included in hartree - fock ) an alternative starting point might converge faster , or even provide convergence in regions where it can not be achieved with hartree - fock .",
    "first of all we start with the simplest possible starting point ; the pure one  electron wave functions . in this case the basis set consists of the solutions to the pure 2d harmonic oscillator in the chosen box and we treat the whole electron  electron interaction as the perturbation .",
