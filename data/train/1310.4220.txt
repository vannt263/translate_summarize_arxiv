    "although much progress has been made in recent years , entanglement remains one of the most mysterious phenomena in the quantum world , and the interplay between entanglement and locality is the engine behind many quantum protocols . in the paradigm of local bipartite quantum state discrimination , two parties ( alice and bob ) each control a quantum system , which we represent as finite - dimensional spaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "their joint system @xmath3 has been prepared in a pure state from the set @xmath4 ; the two component systems are then separated .",
    "alice and bob know @xmath5 and they would like to determine the value of @xmath6 . since they are physically separate , their possible measurement protocols are restricted to those using only local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "the study of the power and limitations of locc has potential applications in cryptography , communication , and data hiding @xcite and is also of inherent interest as a tool to understand entanglement .",
    "the class of bipartite locc measurements can be further broken down based on how the classical communication is used .",
    "local product measures are those in which alice and bob separately perform measurements and only communicate after the fact to compare and interpret their results . in one - way locc",
    ", bob may adapt his measurement based on classical information received from alice but no information is allowed to move in the other direction .",
    "finally , full two - way locc allows alice and bob to communicate classically as much as they like and to iteratively adapt their measurements as they go .",
    "these distinctions are depicted schematically in figure [ locc subsets ] .",
    "[ locc subsets ]       in this paper , we will be exclusively concerned with families of orthogonal maximally entangled states .",
    "orthogonal states could be perfectly distinguished if both parties were in the same place , while sets of states with maximal entanglement have the property that neither party can unilaterally extract any information about the identity of @xmath7 ; both parties must make measurements in order to learn anything at all .",
    "we will be primarily concerned with the question of _ perfect _ local state discrimination : when is it possible for alice and bob to determine the identity of @xmath7 100% of the time ?",
    "it is known that any two orthogonal maximally entangled states may be perfectly distinguished with one - way locc ( since any two pure states can be distinguished this way @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that any three mutually orthogonal maximally entangled @xmath8 states can be distinguished with local operators and classical communications , and fan @xcite showed that any three generalized pauli states in dimension @xmath0 can be perfectly distinguished if @xmath0 is a prime number greater than two . since then it has been an open question whether _ any _ three mutually orthogonal maximally entangled states in high dimensions can be distinguished perfectly with locc .    in this work",
    "we give examples of three maximally entangled non - qubit states which can not be perfectly distinguished with one - way locc .",
    "these examples _ can _ be distinguished using full two - way locc .",
    "these are obviously the smallest sets of states with this property and may be the first known sets of entangled pure states for which two - way locc is necessary and sufficient .    we also show that any three orthogonal maximally entangled states may be distinguished with positive partial transpose measurements ( ppt ) and can be distinguished with one - way locc _ with high probability_. the question of distinguishing any three maximally entangled states using full locc measurements remains open , but these results show that the answer lies in the space between ppt and one - way locc measures and that this space is small .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ triples ] , we present a summary of the results which pertain to local discrimination of a generic triple of orthogonal maximally entangled states . in section [ counterexamples ] , we discuss the necessary conditions for one - way locc discrimination and construct two different families of examples for which one - way locc is insufficient .",
    "we also point out that it _ is _ possible to distinguish these families using locc with two rounds of communication . in section [ pptsection ]",
    "we prove our ppt bound , while section [ onewayconstruction ] proves an upper bound on the minimum error in one - way locc .",
    "section [ morestates ] extends these results to larger sets of states which are distinguishable with ppt but not one - way locc .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of the question which is conspicuously not answered here  whether there exist triples of orthogonal maximally entangled states which can not be locally distinguished .",
    "there is also an appendix , in which we present two - way protocols to distinguish the example sets from each other .",
    "in the interest of studying locality and entanglement , we would very much like to understand which sets of bipartite states can and can not be distinguished using locc . however , the class of locc measurements is notoriously messy to describe mathematically , so we approach the problem using the standard nested set of measurement classes : [ hierarchy ] lo locc-1 locc sep ppt all here , locc represents the full class of measurements which can implemented with locc .",
    "the subsets of locc are local product measures ( lo ) and one - way locc ( locc-1 ) , which have already been discussed .",
    "the supersets of locc are described in terms of mathematical formalism , not operationally .",
    "a measurement @xmath9 is separable ( sep ) if each @xmath10 can be decomposed as @xmath11 across the @xmath12 split , with @xmath13 for each @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is a positive partial transpose ( ppt ) measurement if , for each @xmath10 , the operator @xmath16 is positive semidefinite , where @xmath17 is the transpose operation .",
    "this is described more in section [ pptsection ] .",
    "the inclusions in ( [ hierarchy ] ) are strict , and for each separation we can find sets of states which demonstrate this separation .",
    "table [ tableresults ] summarizes the state of knowledge about small sets of maximally entangled states , highlighting one or two citations for each . in the table , @xmath18 is the number of states and @xmath0 is the dimension ; and the question is : given a set of @xmath18 orthogonal maximally entangled states in @xmath19 $ ] , are you able to distinguish them perfectly ?",

    "note that the standard results for three pauli states , for three maximally entangled states in @xmath34 $ ] , and for two qubit maximally entangled states are generally stated in terms of one - way locc .",
    "here we simply point out they can actually be accomplished with a product measurement .",
    "the proof of fan s result @xcite given in @xcite shows that alice can measure in a basis of eigenstates for a generalized pauli matrix .",
    "bob will always measure in the same basis as alice and does not need to know her outcome to do so .",
    "they can then separately send their results to a third party who will identify the state they started with , as indicated in figure [ locc subsets ] .",
    "( in the special case that three matrices generate a cyclic group , the product measurement in @xcite may also be used . )",
    "similarly , the measurement constructed in @xcite to distinguish maximally entangled states in @xmath34 $ ] is actually a product measurement , although not explicitly stated .",
    "finally , we point out that even the standard result for two pure states becomes a product measurement when both states are qubit maximally entangled states .    as is apparent from the table",
    ", we do not yet know whether all triples of orthogonal maximally entangled states can be distinguished with locc .",
    "the focus of the current work is to explore this question .",
    "the first result is a negative one :    [ locc1 ] there exist triples of mutually orthogonal maximally entangled states in @xmath35 which can not be distinguished with one - way locc .",
    "in fact , there exist triples of mutually orthogonal maximally entangled states in @xmath36 which can not be distinguished with one - way locc in any dimension @xmath0 for which @xmath0 is even or @xmath37 .",
    "these examples are significant , as there are not many known sets which highlight the difference between one - way locc and full locc .",
    "the nonlocality without entanglement states of bennett _",
    "et al._@xcite are a basis of nine pure product states in @xmath34 $ ] which can not be distinguished with locc  they exemplify the difference between separable measurements and locc . in addition , a subset of seven of these nine states can be distinguished with full locc but not one - way locc .",
    "this is the most famous example of pure states which have this property .",
    "in fact , few others have been found .",
    "et al._@xcite gave examples of sets of four and five generalized pauli states which can not be distinguished with one - way locc ; but it remains an open question whether they can be distinguished with locc at all .",
    "et al._@xcite showed that one can distinguish a pure maximally entangled states from the maximally noisy mixed state more successfully with two - way locc than with one - way ; but the two states are not perfectly distinguishable in either case .",
    "thus , the examples in section [ counterexamples ] are interesting in their own right , to understand the difference between these two paradigms .",
    "while locc-1 is a strict subset of all possible locc measurements , the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) measurements form a strict superset . and in this case , we get an affirmative result :    [ ppt ] any three orthogonal maximally entangled states in @xmath38 , @xmath30 , can be perfectly distinguished with a ppt measurement .",
    "when @xmath39 , this theorem follows from the locc result in @xcite . for larger values of @xmath0 , it is a corollary to a more general result , theorem [ ppttheorem ] , which is stated and proved in section [ pptsection ] .    taken together , theorems [ locc1 ] and [ ppt ] show that there is a gap between locc-1 and ppt when it comes to triples of maximally entangled states . since the set of locc measurements is strictly between these two sets , we would like to understand how big is the gap between them .",
    "the following result says that this gap is not very big .",
    "[ locc1 bound ] any three orthogonal maximally entangled states in @xmath38 can be distinguished with one - way locc with error probability at most @xmath40 .",
    "the question of whether any three orthogonal maximally entangled states can be distinguished using locc measures has proved challenging , as the answer lies in the small space between locc-1 and ppt .",
    "the significance of the current work is to show that there is in fact a gap between these two sets with respect to this problem ; this will hopefully point the way to answering the general locc question .    in the remainder of the paper , we prove our results and explore our examples in greater detail .",
    "in this , section we present our families of examples . the first family is defined in @xmath19 $ ] when @xmath0 is even ; the second family when @xmath41 .",

    "a one - way locc measurement is of the form @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 for each value of @xmath18 .",

    "it is hoped that specific constructions of such sets of states will establish ( a ) whether these states are distinguishable with two - way locc and ( b ) whether these sets are not simply supersets of each other ; that is , can we find such sets for which any @xmath214 of them _ are _ distinguishable with one - way locc . while this has not been done in general",

    "@xmath0 , there exists sets of four maximally entangled states such that any three of them can be distinguished with one - way locc but the entire set can not be .",
    "we use the construction above with @xmath215 and use the specific example from @xcite of a set of four lattice states which are not distinguishable even with ppt measurements .",
    "the rest of the proposition follows from the following lemma , which is proved in the appendix .    [ lattice ]",
    "any set of three qubit lattice states in @xmath216 $ ] can be distinguished with one - way locc .",
    "this means that the set of four indistinguishable lattice states in @xmath216 $ ] is minimal , since any three can be distinguished with one - way locc .",
    "we have addressed the question of whether there exist triples of orthogonal maximally entangled states in @xmath19 $ ] which can not be distinguished using local operations and classical communications ; and in the process have given the smallest possible examples of sets of states which are distinguishable with two - way locc but not one - way .",
    "the region between these two paradigms remains elusive , and very few examples have been given of sets such as these .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown that _ any _ set of three orthogonal maximally entangled states can be distinguished perfectly with a positive partial transpose measurement and with high probability using one - way locc .",
    "the answer to the question of locc distinguishability is located in the small space between these results , somewhere in the murky area between locc-1 and ppt .",
    "the open question of the existence of triples which can not be distinguished with locc is interesting for its own sake but also to push our understanding of the line between locc and not .",
    "* acknowledgement : * the author is grateful to saint mary s college for granting a sabbatical , during which much of this work was completed .",
    "given the difficulty in giving a mathematical characterization of the full set of locc measurements , the most effective way to show that a set of states is distinguishable with locc is to explicitly build a protocol to distinguish them .",
    "below , we show how we can distinguish the examples described in section [ counterexamples ] .",
    "we show that the examples given in section [ counterexampleseven ] may be distinguished perfectly with a two - way locc protocol .",
    "we use the tensor product structure of this example to use one - way locc to eliminate one of the three states ; that is , we use one - way locc to transform @xmath218 into @xmath219 for @xmath220 .",
    "we can then use a second round of locc to distinguish the remaining two options .",
    "the protocol is as follows :    \\(1 ) we will initially assume that the origin is in the convex hull of the points @xmath221 in the complex plane .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that the imaginary parts of @xmath222 and @xmath223 are either all positive or all negative .",
    "suppose this is the case",
    ". then we can define [ pvector ] p_0 & = & ( ) p_1 = ( ) p_2 = ( ) with @xmath224 .",
    "it is easily checked that under our assumption , @xmath225 is orthogonal to the vector @xmath226 .",
    "\\(2 ) alice performs the measurement @xmath227 which acts only on her first qubit system , defined by a_0,0 & = & ( i_m - 0 0 ) _ 2 + a_j , k & = & a_j , k a_j , k _ 2 j>0 + & & a_j , k = ( 0 + ( -1)^k j ) if alice receives the outcome @xmath228 , then the first system is in the same entangled state @xmath229 regardless of the value of @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath230 , we can use this state to teleport half of the bell state from alice to bob , and bob can distinguish the three bell states once they are completely on his side . in this case , only one direction of locc is needed .",
    "however , suppose alice receives the outcome @xmath231 for @xmath232 .",
    "then bob s first qubit system is in the state @xmath233 for @xmath234 , which lies in the two - dimensional span of @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",

    "i ( -1)^k(p_0 + p_1 + p_2 ) = 0by our construction of the vector @xmath225 in ( [ pvector ] ) .",
    "this means that _",
    "i b_j , k , i b_j , k , i = 0 0 + j j so , @xmath237 is a complete measurement on this two - dimensional space ; and for each @xmath6 , @xmath238 .",
    "so , no matter the outcome , one of the possibilities for @xmath6 has been eliminated .",
    "\\(3 ) now , alice and bob can dispose of their @xmath239 system and focus on their qubit system , where they share one of two possible bell states , unchanged by the previous measurements .",
    "these two bell states can be perfectly distinguished with locc .",
    "note that bob s measurement depends on some information from alice and also that alice s measurement depends on information from bob .",
    "this is the heart of a two - way locc protocol .",
    "\\(4 ) we now return to our initial assumption , that the origin was in the convex hull of @xmath221 . without this assumption ,",
    "the nonnegative vector @xmath240 is not orthogonal to @xmath241 .    to fix this",
    ", we perform a rotation on each of alice and bob s systems .",
    "this is the only step in which the @xmath76 systems interact with the qubit ones . for each @xmath242 , we define a block diagonal unitary matrix : w_j =    _ j & + & i_m-1 _ 2    that is , all the diagonal blocks are the identity except the first .",
    "this is essentially a control-@xmath243 of a @xmath188-dimensional system on a two - dimensional system : if the large system is in state @xmath235 , @xmath243 is applied to the small system .",
    "we note that for any phase @xmath244 , @xmath245 .",
    "so , as an initializing first step , alice and bob perform the product rotation @xmath246 , which affects the states as \\",
    "{ t_1 _ 2 , t_x , t_z } \\ { t_1 _ 2 , t _",
    "x , t_ z } with @xmath247 .",
    "we choose the unique value of @xmath248 such that the imaginary parts of @xmath249 and @xmath250 are either all positive or all negative .",
    "after this step , the origin is in the convex hull of @xmath251 and we can run the rest of our protocol .",
    "we can see then that the three states @xmath252 may be perfectly distinguished with two - way locc , even though it is not possible with one - way .",
    "we now show that the examples in section [ type ii locc ] can also be distinguished with two - way locc . unlike the previous protocol ,",
    "this is not a method of elimination : all three possibilities remain until the last step .",
    "the protocol is as follows .",
    "first , alice measures using @xmath253 with a_k = 0 0 + 1 1 + k+2 k+2 all outcomes are equivalent , so without loss of generality we will assume that @xmath254 . and for simplicity , we will focus on the base case , @xmath255 ; the general case is identical except that all threes are replaced with @xmath256 .",
    "the outcome @xmath257 maps the matrix @xmath66 to @xmath258 , leaving our three matrices as    & + & 0 0    x & + & 1 0    z & + & 2 0    we claim that at this point , only one more measurement by each party is necessary . according to proposition [ onewaylocc ] , this is equivalent to the existence of a partial isometry @xmath259 such that for each @xmath47 , @xmath260 has every diagonal element equal to zero .",
    "we construct such a @xmath62 below , with some motivation .",
    "let @xmath261 be a row of @xmath62 , partitioned with @xmath262 and @xmath263 as before .",
    "the orthogonality conditions imply that [ twoway5orthogonality ] u^*xu + 3 0 vv^ * 1 = 0 + u^*zu + 3 0 vv^ * 2 = 0 + u^*zxu + 3 2 vv^ * 1 = 0 we write @xmath264 and mimic the argument in section [ type ii locc ] , noting that ( [ twoway5orthogonality ] ) implies that \\",
    "{ v_1 , v_2 , i v_1 } for general @xmath73 and @xmath77 , this implies that two of these numbers must be zero .",
    "hence , @xmath265 for some @xmath266 .",
    "this also implies that @xmath267 for two values of @xmath6 .",
    "as an example , suppose that @xmath268 .",

    "this leads us to the following set of 4 ( non - normalized ) vectors :    u_i + v_i    \\ {     + 0 + 1 + 0 + -    ,    - + 0 + 1 + 0 + -    ,    0 +   + 1 + 0 +    ,    0 + - + 1 + 0 +    } each of these vectors has the desired properties .",

    "rescaling gives us a complete measurement with 15 outcomes which bob can perform based on the outcome of alice s measurement .",
    "( if bob did nt know the outcome of alice s measurement , he could nt properly coordinate the values of @xmath271 and @xmath278 , hence the necessitity of two - way communication . )",
    "the corresponding partial isometry has four columns for each of the pauli matrices plus a set of three columns for the identity , yielding the @xmath279 matrix @xmath280 :    & - & 0 & 0 & & - & & - & & - & & -&0&0&0 + 0 & 0 & & - & & - & - & & -i & i & i & -i & 0&0&0 + 1&1&1&1&1&1&1&1&0&0&0&0&&0&0 + 0&0&0&0&- & - & & & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 0 + - & - & & & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & - i & - i & i & i & 0 & 0 &    it is straightforward to check that @xmath281 and that when @xmath47 , the diagonal entries of @xmath282 are all zero .",
