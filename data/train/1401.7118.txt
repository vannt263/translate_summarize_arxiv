    "most of the studies of photon trajectories in the kn and kn(a)ds spacetimes have focused in the investigation of the allowed parameter space and/or the analysis of selected orbits , see for instance @xcite and @xcite,@xcite without actually integrating the null geodesic equations . for the case of charged particle orbits in the kn spacetime , we refer the reader to the works of @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore the purpose of this paper , to calculate for the _ first time , _ the exact solutions of the null geodesics in kn and kn(a)ds spacetimes and produce closed form solutions for relativistic observables such as : the deflection angle and frame dragging effect that light rays experience in the curved spacetime geometry of kn and kn(a)ds spacetimes .",
    "furthermore , we treat analytically for the first time the more involved problem in which we consider the electrically charged , rotating ( kn ) black hole as a gravitational lens , i.e. a kn black hole along with a static source of light and a static observer both located far away but otherwise at arbitrary positions in space .    in addition",
    ", our contribution generalises in a _ non - trivial _ way our previous analytic results for the geodesy of kerr and kerr-(anti ) de sitter black holes ( uncharged rotating black holes ) @xcite,@xcite , which constitute a special case of the more general kn and kn(a)ds black holes and thus a comparison of the relativistic observables can be made .",
    "as we shall see in the main body of the paper , the electric charge of the black hole influences the geometry of spacetime and the corresponding relativistic observables such as the deflection angle and the frame dragging effect of light in a significant way which in principle is measurable .",
    "it is pleasing that the theory produced in this work is a complete theory for the propagation of light signals in the field of rotating charged black holes : _ all _ of its fundamental parameters enter the analytic solutions on an equal footing .",
    "the resulting theory should also be of interest for the galactic centre studies given the strong experimental evidence we have from the observation of stellar orbits ( in particular from the orbits of @xmath22stars in the central arcsecond of the milky way ) and flares that the sagittarius a * region harbours  a supermassive rotating black hole with mass of 4 million solar masses @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it will help in measuring the fundamental properties of the black hole such as its mass , spin and electric charge , the cosmological parameters as well as in measuring novel relativistic effects such as the gravitational bending of light , and the corresponding lense - thirring effect at the _ strong field regime _ of general relativity .",
    "although it is not the purpose of this paper to discuss how a net electric charge is accumulated inside the horizon of the black hole , we briefly mention recent attempts which address the issue of the formation of charged black holes .",
    "indeed , we note at this point , that the authors in @xcite , have studied the effect of electric charge in compact stars assuming that the charge distribution is proportional to the mass density .",
    "they found solutions with a large positive net electric charge . from the local effect of the forces experienced on a single charged particle",
    ", they concluded that each individual charged particle is quickly ejected from the star .",
    "this is in turn produces  a huge force imbalance ,  in which the gravitational force overwhelms the repulsive coulomb and fluid pressure forces .",
    "in such a scenario the star collapses to form a charged black hole before all the charge leaves the system @xcite .",
    "a mechanism for generating charge asymmetry that may be linked to the formation of a charged black hole has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "for some phenomenological investigations of the electric charges of some astronomical bodies in reissner - nordstrm spacetimesand of toroidal configurations in reissner - nordstrm-(anti)-de sitter black hole and naked singularity spacetimes see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the material of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sppolarkn ] , we investigate the propagation of a light signal on the sphere and in particular we derive the exact solution of polar spherical null geodesics in kerr - newman spacetime .",
    "the solution is expressed in terms of the weierstra  elliptic function .",
    "the amount of frame dragging for such a photon orbit is four times the real period of the weierstra  function which is expressed in terms of gau s hypergeometric function , see eqn.([gvkfdknp ] ) .",
    "we subsequently apply our exact solutions for computing the amount of frame dragging that a polar null spherical geodesic experiences in the gravitational field of the sgra * galactic black hole assuming that the latter is a kerr - newman black hole , for various sets of values for the spin and electric charge of the singularity . in section [ nusplambda ] , we derive the exact solution for the lense - thirring effect for a spherical polar null orbit in kn - spacetime in the presence of the cosmological constant @xmath23 our solution is expressed in terms of appell s hypergeometric function of two - variables @xmath24 , see eqn @xmath25 in section [ snpnullkn ] , we compute in closed analytic form the amount of lense - thirring precession that a spherical non - polar orbit ( i.e. with impact parameter @xmath26 undergoes in kerr - newman spacetime , in terms of appell s hypergeometric function @xcite and gau s ordinary hypergeometric function , see our eqn .",
    "we also apply our exact formula @xmath28 for the calculation of frame dragging for spherical non - polar orbits in the gravitational field of a charged rotating ( kn ) black hole for various sets of values of the physical parameters .",
    "subsequently , in section [ knadsnpspher ] we derive the generalization of formula @xmath28 in the case where the cosmological constant is present .",

    "our exact solution for the deflection angle , involves lauricella s hypergeometric function of three variables , eqns.@xmath34 .    using a uniformization of the correspondence between the coefficients of the quartic radial polynomial - that is involved in the calculation of the gravitational light deflection - and its roots we provide a closed form compact analytic solution for the four roots in terms of weierstra  elliptic function @xmath35 and its derivative @xmath36 subsequently",
    ", we apply thoroughly , our analytic solution for the deflection angle @xmath37 for the calculation of the gravitational bending of light of an equatorial ray in the spacetime geometry of a kn black hole .",
    "the deflection angle of an equatorial light ray in knds spacetime is calculated in section [ defllambda ] .",
    "we then solve the more involved problem of treating a kerr - newman black hole as a gravitational lens , i.e. a kn black hole along with a static source of light and a static observer both located far away but otherwise at arbitrary positions in space .",
    "again , for this model we give the analytic solutions of the lens equations in terms of appell and lauricella hypergeometric functions and the weierstra  modular form , see eqns.@xmath38 . from constraints following from the condition that a photon escapes to infinity , an equation is derived which describes the boundary of the shadow of the electromagnetic rotating black hole on the observer s image plane , see equations ( [ iskiosfortismenisbh ] ) .",
    "some examples of solutions of the lens equations , for particular values of the physical parameters are worked out and exhibited along with the boundary of the shadow of the kn black hole on the observer s image plane .",
    "we use section [ symperasma ] for our conclusions .    in appendix a , we present the theory in which the roots of the particular quartic radial polynomial involved in the calculations of the photonic trajectories in the kn spacetime , are elegantly expressed in terms of the weirstra@xmath39 modular form @xmath35 and its derivative @xmath40 . in the appendix [ speriastronkn ] of section [ lightdefknimpor ] ,",
    "we derive the closed form analytic solution for the relativistic periastron advance of a non - circular equatorial timelike geodesic in the kn spacetime in terms of appell s hypergeometric function of two - variables @xmath41 and gau@xmath39 s hypergeometric function @xmath42 , eqn.([relativiperiastronprec ] ) .",
