    "in the nonrelativistic constituent quark model for mesons and baryons the quarks are bound by confining potentials . despite their limitations and concerns about their validity",
    ", these potential models describe the properties of the various mesons and baryons surprisingly well ( see , for example , silvestre - brac @xcite and the two excellent review articles by lucha et al .",
    "@xcite and richard @xcite on the matter ) .",
    "once the potential model approach is adopted , the three - quark problem can be solved using various approaches . among them",
    ", the hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) method is quite successful in applications as it is well suited to describe radial and orbital excitations @xcite . within the framework of the hh method",
    ", the hypercentral approximation ( hca ) has been used in the past @xcite to study the spectrum of the baryon .",
    "there are various reasons for adopting the hca to study the three quark system : i ) the two - body potential acting between quarks is quite soft and therefore in the hh expansion of the interaction only the first term gives a significant contribution to the binding energy .",
    "this of course means that the two - body correlations are not as strong as compared to the nuclear correlations ; ii ) it is quite simple and thus one avoids the complicated three - body calculations via , for example , the faddeev equations @xcite , and iii ) the results obtained from it are accurate and the spectra are well reproduced .",
    "another method , in the framework of the hh method , is the integrodifferential equation approach ( idea ) @xcite which includes higher terms of the hh expansion in an average manner .",
    "the idea method takes two - body correlations into account exactly , reproduces the spectrum of the nucleon quite well , and provides wave functions reliably @xcite which is crucial in studying photoexcitation processes .",
    "these processes are manifested as resonances and can be excited through electromagnetic transitions giving rise to large enhancements in the total absorption cross section @xcite .",
    "the photoexcitation of the nucleon resonances has been studied in the past by various groups @xcite .",
    "the results obtained by them are rather unsatisfactory when compared to the experimental data .",
    "the inclusion of retardation effects and relativistic corrections does not improve the situation much @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the absorption of a single photon by a nucleon which then undergoes a transition from the ground state to an excited one .",
    "the photoabsorption cross section is calculated using various quark - quark potentials and by using the hca and idea methods .    in sec .",
    "2 we describe our formalism . in sec .",
    "3 we give details on how the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition amplitudes are calculated while in sec .",
    "4 we present our results and discussions .",
    "the photoexcitation process is described by the transition amplitude @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the initial ground state wave function of the nucleon , @xmath4 is the wave function of the final excited state , and @xmath5 the perturbative electromagnetic hamiltonian . in what follows",
    "we shall discuss these ingredients in some detail .",
    "the fully antisymmetric total wave function for a three - quark system can be expressed as a product of configuration space , flavor , spin , and color functions .",

    "( [ protong ] ) , while the final wave function for the delta is @xmath34      the perturbative hamiltonian for the electric dipole e1 transition , in the case of three quarks of equal mass m , is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the momentum of quark @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes a polarization direction of the incident photon . for @xmath39 and @xmath40 quarks , the charge operator has the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the third component of the isospin of the @xmath37-th quark with @xmath43 using commutation relations to express the momenta in terms of the three - quark hamiltonian @xcite we may rewrite ( [ he11 ] ) in a siegert form @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the coordinate of @xmath37-th quark conjugate to the momentum @xmath46 . in jacobi",
    "coordinates we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the difference between the final and initial binding energies and the operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given by @xmath51 thus , instead of expressing the hamiltonian in terms of the individual particle charge and coordinates , the more appropriate jacobi coordinates and operators @xmath52 and @xmath50 which act on quasi - particles @xcite are used .",
    "the magnetic dipole @xmath53 causes the transition @xmath54 , in which the proton , after absorbing a photon ( @xmath55 ) , is excited to the delta ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the corresponding perturbative hamiltonian is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the magnetic moment operator of the @xmath37-th quark .",
    "since @xmath59 does not contain any orbital operators , in this transition the spin must change instead .",
    "noting that @xmath60 and by letting the charge operators @xmath52 and @xmath50 act on the three - quark isospin states we finally obtain for the transition matrix elements @xmath61 the integrals in ( [ me11 ] ) were evaluated using euler angles @xmath62 as external and @xmath63 as internal coordinates . here",
    "the @xmath64 axis is chosen to coincide with @xmath65 and @xmath66 is lying in the @xmath67 plane .",
    "thus only a five dimensional integration has to be done numerically since both @xmath68 and the two components of @xmath69 are invariant with respect to a rotation about the z - axis and thus do _ not _    depend on @xmath70 . after averaging over the direction of @xmath71 and polarization direction",
    "one obtains the following expression for the absolute square of the transition matrix elements @xmath72 therefore , the following integrals are required @xmath73 the corresponding integrated photoabsorption cross section for a single excited electric dipole state , in the long wavelength limit @xcite , is @xmath74 for the @xmath1 transition amplitude we have    @xmath75    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are given by eqs .",
    "( [ protong ] ) and ( [ fwp ] ) respectively .    the process @xmath76",
    "( @xmath77 ) can take place either via the magnetic dipole ( @xmath1 ) or the electric quadrupole ( @xmath78 ) transition . in the quark model the latter transition is forbidden @xcite because it is proportional to the charge operator which can not cause transitions between quark spin @xmath79 and @xmath80 states , and hence the matrix element vanishes by orthogonality of the quark spin wave functions .",
    "the @xmath1 transition involves the quark magnetic moments  hence the spin operator  and this can lead to transitions @xmath31 @xcite . the transition matrix element can be written as @xmath81 using the the flavor , spin , and configuration space wave functions and averaging over the two photon polarization directions we finally obtain    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the overlap integral given by @xmath84 like in the electric transitions , the photoabsorption cross section for a single excited magnetic dipole state is @xmath85",
    "the quark - quark potential can be written as a sum of the central and the spin - spin parts @xmath86 where @xmath87 contains , as usual , the confinement and the coulombic parts while @xmath88 is of the general form @xmath89 the spin - dependent interaction , suggested by the perturbative one - gluon exchange mechanism , is important in describing the splitting of the meson masses and the experimental mass difference @xmath90 .",
    "it contains the function @xmath91 which is singular as @xmath92 and therefore the corresponding wave equation has no physically acceptable solutions and one expects a collapse in both the quark - quark and in baryon systems . to avoid this a cut - off or a smearing function is introduced to reduce the singularity and to make the calculations tractable .",
    "since the resulting spin - spin potential is strongly attractive and short - ranged , it can generate significant short  range correlations which have stronger effects on the ground state than on the excited @xmath93 states .",
    "the strong correlations at short distances in the @xmath33 partial wave are not expected to play a major role in photoexcitation processes as the excited states are shifted to the outer region and thus in the overlap integral short - range contributions are rather unimportant",
    ". therefore any influence of the spin - spin force will come from the modification of the mass differences and of the corresponding wave functions . in this work we performed calculations with the @xmath87 term alone as well as with both terms",
    "for the calculations with the @xmath87 part only , we employed the martin @xcite , the cornell @xcite , and the lichtenberg @xcite potentials . for the calculations",
    "in which both terms are included we used the ono - schberl potential @xcite and two of the recently published potentials by silvestre - brac @xcite , namely , the ap1 and ap2 versions which have the general form @xmath94 with @xmath95 the parameters for ap1 are given by @xmath96 while those of ap2 are given by @xmath97 we remind here the reader that the quark - quark potential @xmath98 is related to the quark - antiquark potential @xmath99 by lipkin s rule @xcite , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "the results obtained for the ground state and the first orbitally excited state of the nucleon with spin - independent potentials and by using the idea and hca methods are given in table i. both methods are in very good agreement with each other and the transition energy @xmath101 , shown in table ii , is reasonably well reproduced .",
    "this transition energy and the corresponding wave functions were used to calculate the integrated photoabsorption cross section @xmath102 due to the e1 transition , from the ground state to the n(1520 ) resonance .",
    "our results are given in table ii together with experimental values and those of other methods .",
    "it is seen that for both the idea and the hca the cross sections are in good to very good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the results obtained by other methods for the transition energy are generally very low as compared to the experimental ones except those obtained via the isgur - karl ( i.k . )",
    "model @xcite , which , nevertheless , can not reproduce the experimental photoabsorption cross section @xmath102 well .",
    "this mainly implies that the corresponding wave functions are not adequate to describe the photoabsorption cross section for the e1 transition .",
    "the latter is also true for the wave functions employed by brizzolara and giannini in their thorough investigations on the nucleon photoabsorption @xcite based on the nonrelativistic quark model of isgur and karl and the bag model .",
    "they explicitly demonstrated that the results are rather strongly dependent on the hyperfine mixing and on the dimensions of the system and thus on the h.o parameter used .",
    "the discrepancy with the experimental results still persists even when other contributions such as charge plus current densities with and without retardation effects are incorporated into the h.o model .",
    "three - body force components of the quark interaction ( in the 3q model ) , and relativistic corrections in the framework of the bag model do not improve matters to a significant degree either .",
    "apart , of course , from the inadequacy of the wave functions these discrepancies probably stem also from some other fundamental absorption mechanism , such as the coupling to mesons and/or @xmath103 pairs @xcite .    the results for the nucleon masses obtained by using spin - dependent potentials are given in table iii .",
    "the corresponding transition energy @xmath101 together with the cross sections are presented in table iv .",
    "it is seen that both ap1 and ap2 potentials of silvestre - brac give excellent results for the photoabsorption cross section @xmath102 .",
    "this came as a surprise since the transition energies are not as good as one would like them to be .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that in the confining potential the excited state lies at a higher energy as compared to the experimental value and thus the wave function for @xmath16 is more spread out in space and therefore the overlap integral somehow compensates for the excess transition energy .",
    "our results obtained with the ono - schberl potential are in fair agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the delta masses are given in table v while the transition energy @xmath104 is shown in table vi ; it is well reproduced but the results for the corresponding integrated photoabsorption cross section of the @xmath105(1232 ) resonance are only in fair agreement with the experimental values .",
    "the same is true for the i.k model .",
    "this discrepancy can be connected to the strong dependence on the quark masses that enter the cross section via the magnetic moments .",
    "finally the energy and cross  section results obtained via the idea and hca methods are quite similar .",
    "this comes as no major surprise as the quark - quark potentials are soft and thus two - body correlations do not play a significant role .",
    "this means that the corresponding wave functions are fairly similar and the small differences between them do not strongly influence the overlap integral and thus the cross sections . in the case where a spin - spin force was used the short  range correlations",
    "are not manifested in the overlap integral either due to the shifting of the @xmath106 wave function to the outer region .",
    "in conclusion the nonrelativistic potential model reproduced the experimental data for the e1 transitions quite successfully .",
    "there is a weak potential dependence and in the case of the spin - independent potentials the best results are obtained with the lichtenberg potential . in the case of the spin - dependent potentials both ap1 and ap2 give excellent results for the e1 photoabsorption cross sections . in the m1 transitions where there is a strong dependence on the quark",
    "masses the ono - schberl potential gives better results than the ap1 and ap2 potentials .",
