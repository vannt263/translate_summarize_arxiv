    "the higgs boson was hypothesised  @xcite in the year 1964 and since then experimental searches for this elusive boson have been performed in different collider experiments worldwide . finally , after around 50 years of its theoretical proposition , a higgs boson is discovered by both the atlas and cms experiments of lhc at cern , geneva ; the announcement of which was made on july 4 , 2012  @xcite .",
    "with accumulation of more data throughout the year 2012 , the properties of this newly observed boson was measured more accurately .",
    "the spin and parity properties and couplings of higgs boson with fermions and bosons , the so - called @xmath15 and @xmath16 , have been measured in different decay channels  @xcite of higgs boson .",
    "though most of the measurements are consistent with sm predictions within uncertainties , there is still some room for new physics beyond the sm , given the amount of uncertainties are still quite large in some cases .",
    "in the framework of the sm , the interaction between the higgs boson and the sm fermions , written in the mass eigenstate basis is @xmath17 where @xmath18 s are the left handed fermion ( lepton or quark ) doublet and @xmath19 s denote the right handed fermion singlet . @xmath20",
    "represent the yukawa couplings in the mass basis and are diagonal in the paradigm of sm .",
    "in such a scenario , lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) higgs decays are prohibited .",
    "however , such lfv decays can be incorporated in many beyond the sm ( bsm ) scenarios .",
    "for example , models with additional higgs or other scalar fields  @xcite , higgs portals  @xcite , flavor symmetric models broken at the electroweak scale  @xcite and horizontal gauge symmetries   @xcite can explain such exotic decays of the higgs boson .",
    "on the other hand , prototypical supersymmetric models with  @xcite and without r - parity violation  @xcite are rather unlikely to explain such signals . however , in the context of this work , we will consider a model independent approach and will remain completely agnostic about different models which can give rise to lfv higgs decays , more precisely @xmath21 channel . from the perspective of effective field theory ( eft ) , one can write down higher dimensional operators ( @xmath22 ) suppressed by a new physics scale @xmath23 .",
    "these operators would get generated by integrating out the ` _ non - standard _ '",
    "heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "all of these operators would certainly leave a fingerprint in the low energy theory .",
    "as discussed in ref  @xcite a dimension 6 operator of the form @xmath24 can indeed generate a non - diagonal yukawa matrix @xmath20 in the mass eigenstate basis of the fermions , which leads to lfv decays of the higgs boson .    on the experimental frontier ,",
    "the first direct search for lepton flavor violating decays of a higgs boson to a muon - tau pair has been performed by the cms collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the search has been conducted in two channels @xmath0 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 represents hadronic and electronic decays of @xmath28 respectively .",
    "a slight excess of signal events with a significance of 2.4@xmath7 is observed , which corresponds to a local p - value of 0.010 which is at least as large as that observed in data , @xmath29 : p - value = prob @xmath30 .",
    "p - value measures how likely it is to get a certain experimental result as a matter of chance rather than due to a real effect . ] .",
    "a constraint on @xmath31% at 95% confidence level is set and the best fit branching fraction is @xmath32% , as obtained by cms .",
    "this limit on the branching ratio can be subsequently translated to constrain the yukawa coupling @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the atlas collaboration also looked into lfv decay modes of the higgs boson with 8 tev centre - of - mass energy and with 20.3 fb@xmath3 data .",
    "the limit on the branching fraction @xmath34 is set at 1.85%  @xcite .",
    "recently , a search for the sm higgs boson produced in association with a top - quark pair ( @xmath35 ) is performed by the cms collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the search have been performed in different final state combinations , such as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and same - sign @xmath41 .",
    "the observed values of signal strength modifier @xmath42 multiplies the expected sm higgs boson cross - section in such a way that @xmath43 , so @xmath44 and the corresponding errors have been reported .",
    "while the observed @xmath42 in most of these @xmath35 channels are more or less consistent with the sm predictions within the error bars , the measurement in the same - sign di - lepton channel shows an excess of events .",
    "the observed signal strength in same - sign @xmath41 channel is @xmath45 . within this category",
    ", the same - sign di - muon subsample has the largest signal strength , with @xmath46 compared with @xmath47 for the same - sign di - electron channel and @xmath48 for the same - sign electron - muon channel .",
    "it is important to note that for this fit , the higgs boson production rate other than @xmath5 are considered to be the same to the sm expectations .",
    "we shall discuss later the implications when this condition is relaxed .",
    "these two excesses , reported by cms collaboration , may seem uncorrelated but one has to keep in mind that both the observations are related to the newly discovered bosonic state , whose characteristics are yet to be understood completely .",
    "if the @xmath21 decay takes place , then it can show up as excesses in different final states in @xmath35 search .",
    "the two excesses seen in data can be the two different faces of the same coin and it may contain hints for bsm physics . in this work , we will try to find whether these two excesses are related or not .",
    "to check if the excess in @xmath35 same - sign di - muon final state comes from the lfv decays of higgs boson , we have performed a truth - level analysis where we have tried to use a similar event selection criteria as used by cms @xmath35 analysis , whenever possible with an equivalent luminosity of 20 fb@xmath3 , which more or less corresponds to the data set recorded by the cms experiment in 2012 .",
    "we have generated @xmath35 events for center - of - mass energy 8 tev using pythia 6 event generator  @xcite for two situations , one is when all sm decays of higgs boson are allowed and another is when higgs boson can decay only to a @xmath8 pair .",
    "mass of the higgs boson and the top quark are taken as 125.6 gev and 173 gev respectively .",
    "the cross - section of @xmath35 process is considered to be 127 fb  @xcite . following the cms analysis , we have selected the events requiring the presence of exactly two muons ( and no electron ) with same sign of charge and at least four hadronic jets , one of them is required to be a b - quark jet , in the final state .",
    "clustering of jets are done using the built - in pythia module pycell which in turn employs a cone algorithm and incorporates convenient smearing of the momenta . in pycell",
    "we granted for an angular coverage of @xmath49 for the hadron calorimeter with a cell segmentation resembling a generic lhc detector , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , a jet cone of radius @xmath51 has been employed for finding jets .",
    "both the muons should have transverse momentum ( @xmath52 ) greater than 20 gev .",
    "muons and jets should pass the pseudorapidity requirement of @xmath53 .",
    "the scalar sum of the @xmath52 of the two leptons and the missing transverse energy ( @xmath54 ) is required to be above 100 gev .",
    "the cuts mentioned above are the event selection cuts from the cms @xmath35 analysis , where they have found the following result after applying these cuts : the number of events expected from sm @xmath35 signal is 3.1@xmath550.4 and from sm background is 27.7@xmath554.7 ; so the total number of events expected from sm in same - sign dimuon channel is 30.8@xmath555.1 . in this analysis ,",
    "cms has observed 41 events , which is an excess of 10.2 ( 5.1 ) events calculated from the central value ( upper edge of error bar ) of expected number of events .",
    "given that there is an excess of events over the sm expectation , the question is if the lfv decay of higgs boson can explain this excess of events or not .",
    "one has to keep in mind that we have calculated the excess very naively w.r.t the central value and upper edge of the 1@xmath7 error bar and the data is roughly consistent with @xmath56 error - bar .",
    "thus , the exact number of extra events observed in data should not be seen too sacredly .",
    "rather the take - away message from this observation is that there is some upward fluctuation in data , the amount of which is not easy as well as meaningful to quantify without doing a sophisticated multivariate analysis , which have been performed by cms as the next step after the cut - based event selection . in our analysis",
    "we did not apply any multivariate technique , we have used the event selection cuts from the cms analysis .",
    "5 pt    .expected number of events after the selection cuts in same - sign dimuon final state at 8 tev for the @xmath35 production mode for different decay channels of higgs boson . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     at 13 tev",
    "the cross - section of @xmath35 production mode is taken to be 503 fb  @xcite .",
    "we plot the distribution of @xmath52 of trailing muons in same - sign di - muon final state as shown in figure [ fig_pt_13 ] .",
    "the @xmath52 distribution coming from the lfv decay of higgs boson is harder than other sm processes .",
    "so we have applied harder @xmath52 cuts on the muons , compared to the 8 tev analysis , in order to distinguish between signal and background more efficiently .",
    "we require that the leading and trailing muons should pass @xmath57 gev and @xmath58 cuts respectively . apart from this change , all other aspects of the analysis are same as before . for 13 tev ,",
    "the number of events that we have obtained from the lfv decay of higgs boson for the branching ratio of 2% , and number of events obtained from @xmath59 , @xmath60 channels , along with dominant sm background @xmath61 are reported in table [ table : br ] .",
    "just by applying harder @xmath52 cuts , we are not able to kill the background events substantially . for a better discrimination between signal and background",
    ", one should conduct a multivariate analysis which is expected to perform better than a cut - based analysis .",
    "cms has observed an excess of events in @xmath35 production mode in same - sign di - muon final state .",
    "another excess of events in @xmath21 lfv decay channel is also reported by cms .",
    "we have shown that it may be possible that these two excesses are correlated and the effect of lfv decay of higgs boson has shown up in the @xmath35 search of cms .",
    "the branching ratio of lfv decays of higgs boson are not too much constrained from indirect searches performed so far . keeping that in mind we have explored a substantially large range of branching ratio to see how much excess can come from this kind of decays of higgs boson . however , from the direct search of lfv decay , cms has given an upper bound on the branching ratio br(@xmath21 ) which is 1.51% at 95% confidence level .",
    "this bound is obtained by assuming the sm - like cross - section for all the production mechanisms of higgs boson .",
    "this assumption when relaxed and if the production cross - sections are lower than the sm cross - sections ( which is still allowed from the most recent measurements of cms collaboration ) , the upper bound on branching ratio will be pushed further in the upward direction .",
    "we have checked that the branching ratio of @xmath6 can be relaxed upto 3% if one assumes the production cross - section through gluon fusion mode is at is lowest value as reported by cms .",
    "such a branching is still not enough to explain the excess in the same sign dimuon channel but can notably bring down the excess of events within 2@xmath7 value of the sm expectation .",
    "however , the 8 tev data is not sufficient to clear all the doubts as it is limited by statistics . in the next run of lhc at 13 tev",
    ", we can expect more precise measurements of cross - sections and branching ratios of different processes and will provide a more transparent picture .",
    "it is also important to note that if such lfv decays of the higgs boson are indeed present then in addition to the same sign di - muon channel , an excess of similar size would also show up in the same sign electron - muon final state .",
    "although , the simulation results are well within experimental uncertainties , however , more data is required to shed light in this matter .",
    "we also note that the atlas collaboration have already searched for lepton flavour violating higgs decays to @xmath42-@xmath62 final state in their 8 tev analysis and did not found any excess  @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , it is important to re - examine this issue in the light of 13 tev run of the lhc .",
