    "<S> the combination of the unique properties of graphene with spin polarization and magnetism for the design of new spintronic concepts and devices has been hampered by the small coulomb interaction and the tiny spin - orbit coupling of carbon in pristine graphene . </S>",
    "<S> such device concepts would take advantage of the control of the spin degree of freedom utilizing the widely available electric fields in electronics or of topological transport mechanisms such as the conjectured quantum anomalous hall effect . here </S>",
    "<S> we show , using first - principles methods , that @xmath0 transition - metal ( tm ) adatoms deposited on graphene display remarkable magnetic properties . all considered </S>",
    "<S> tm adatoms possess significant spin moments with colossal magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies as large as 50 mev per tm atom . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal that the magneto - electric response of deposited tm atoms is extremely strong and in some cases offers even the possibility to switch the spontaneous magnetization direction by a moderate external electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that an electrically tunable quantum anomalous hall effect can be observed in this type of hybrid materials </S>",
    "<S> .    spin - orbit interaction , which couples the spin degree of freedom of electrons to their orbital motion in the lattice , leads to many prominent physical phenomena , such as the antisymmetric exchange interaction  @xcite , the colossal magnetic anisotropy  @xcite , or the anomalous hall effect  @xcite in conventional ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> it is also the key interaction in the newly - found quantum topological phase in topological insulators , where the quantum spin hall effect was observed experimentally  @xcite , and the quantum anomalous hall effect ( qahe ) was predicted to exist  @xcite . since the orbital motion can be manipulated with external electric fields , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) opens a route to dissipationless transport and to electrical control of magnetic properties  @xcite , playing a crucial role in future spintronics applications .    owing to its strong spin - orbit coupling , heavy @xmath1 and @xmath0 tms display fascinating physical properties for desirable spintronic applications , especially when combined with non - vanishing magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> however , magnetism of @xmath0 tms proved difficult to achieve due to their more delocalized valence @xmath2 wavefunctions and the smaller intra - atomic exchange integrals compared to @xmath3 tms such as fe , co , or ni . </S>",
    "<S> low - dimensional structures , such as monolayers  @xcite , atomic wires  @xcite , and clusters  @xcite , were proposed to facilitate the stability of @xmath0 magnetism by reducing the @xmath2-@xmath2 hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , when deposited on substrates of noble or late transition metals , such as cu , ag , au , and pt , interdiffusion at interfaces is inevitable , and strong hybridization between the @xmath2 states of the substrate and of the adatoms is also destructive for @xmath0 magnetism . from this point of view , using @xmath4 substrates is more promising . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath1 ferromagnetism was first observed in a ru monolayer deposited on the graphite ( 0001 ) surface  @xcite , which is close in its chemical and physical properties to graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> since the day graphene was isolated and produced as a two - dimensional material  @xcite , it abruptly altered the research direction of material science  @xcite with the aim of exploring its fascinating transport properties . in a sense </S>",
    "<S> , graphene serves as a prototype of topological insulators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the berry phase of @xmath5 of electronic states in graphene induces a half - integer quantum hall effect  @xcite , while the existence of the quantum spin hall effect was first suggested for pure graphene when soc is taken into account  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one common feature for those transport properties is the non - trivial topological origin , resulting in dissipationless charge or spin current carried by edge states with conductivity quantized in units of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , from the application point of view , a large external magnetic field is required to obtain the quantum hall effect , and the spin - degeneracy in the quantum spin hall effect makes it hard to manipulate the spin degree of freedom by controlling external fields . </S>",
    "<S> to avoid such constraints while keeping the benefit of topologically protected quantized topological transport , the long - sought qahe is a perfect solution . </S>",
    "<S> the essence of the qahe lies in the quantization of the transverse charge conductivity in a material with intrinsic non - vanishing magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the magnetization in ferromagnets can be much easier handled experimentally than large magnetic fields makes the qahe extremely attractive for applications in spintronics and quantum information . however , at present the qahe is merely a generic theoretical concept for magnetically doped topological insulators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , qiao _ et al . _  suggested that the qahe could also occur at comparatively low temperatures in graphene decorated with fe adatoms  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here , we demonstrate based on first - principles theory that @xmath0 tms deposited on graphene are strongly magnetic , provide colossal magneto - crystalline anisotropy energies and exhibit topologically non - trivial band gaps due to very strong spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> a generic representative of this hybrid class of materials has a magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy of 10@xmath730  mev per tm and a quantum anomalous hall gap in its electronic spectrum with the size of 20@xmath780 mev . in connection with a large magneto - electric response of the deposited adatoms , </S>",
    "<S> we predict that within this class of systems an electrically tunable qahe at room temperature could be achieved experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed first - principles calculations of @xmath0 tm ( hf , ta , w , re , os , ir , and pt ) adatoms on graphene in 2@xmath82 , 3@xmath83 , and 4@xmath84 supercell geometries corresponding to the deposition density of 4.7 , 2.1 and 1.2  atoms / nm@xmath9 , respectively ( see the method part for details ) . throughout this work </S>",
    "<S> the tm atoms are placed at the hollow sites of graphene . according to previous theoretical studies  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it is the most favorable absorption site with the exceptions of pt  @xcite and ir  @xcite , for which the bridge site is more preferable . among all systems </S>",
    "<S> studied we selected one prototype system , w on graphene , that we discuss in more detail . in the 4@xmath84 geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the optimized distance between w adatoms on the hollow site and the c plane is about 1.74   , and the hollow site is about 0.14 ev ( 0.41 ev ) per tm atom lower in energy than the bridge ( top ) site , in agreement with previous observations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> applying an electric field , the relaxed positions change by at most 0.01  bohr radii , and the hollow site remains the preferred adsorption site .    </S>",
    "<S> turning now to magnetism , and looking first at tm atoms adsorbed in the 4@xmath84 supercell , we find that most of the @xmath0 tm atoms ( except for pt ) are magnetic with sizable magnetic moments ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) ranging between 0.5 and 2@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the large magnetization energy calculated , defined as the total energy difference between the nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic state , reaching  e.g.  for ta and w values as high as 0.56  ev and 0.34  ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the magnetic moments across the series of the rather isolated tm atoms do not follow hund s first rule , i.e.  the magnetic moments do not increase in steps of 1@xmath10 from hf to re , reaching a maximum at the center of the tm series and decreasing again from re to pt . on the contrary we find the minimal spin moment for re . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the role of the hybridization of the tm @xmath2-orbitals with graphene . increasing the deposition density studying a 3@xmath83 supercell , the results remain basically unaltered , indicating that the @xmath2-@xmath2 hybridization between neighboring adatoms is week and that the physics is determined by the local tm - graphene bonding . </S>",
    "<S> this changes in the case of the 2@xmath82 geometry , when the adatoms are in close vicinity to each other and the magnetism survives only for ta , w , re , and ir atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> unique to the @xmath0 tms is the property that the soc and the intra - atomic exchange are of the same magnitude . from this </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate a significant influence of soc on the electronic properties , leading to strong anisotropies of the calculated quantities upon changing the direction of magnetization @xmath11 relative to the graphene plane . </S>",
    "<S> the most impressive manifestation of soc in the tm - graphene hybrid materials are the colossal values of the magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) , defined as the total - energy difference between the magnetic states with spin moments aligned in the plane and out of the graphene plane . </S>",
    "<S> the mae presents one of the most fundamental quantities of any magnetic system as its sign defines the easy magnetization axis and its magnitude gives an estimate on the stability of the magnetization with respect to temperature fluctuations @xmath7 a key issue for magnetic storage materials . </S>",
    "<S> a large mae makes the magnetization very stable but also difficult to manipulate .    </S>",
    "<S> the values of the mae obtained in 3@xmath83 and 4@xmath84 geometry , presented in fig .  1b , </S>",
    "<S> lie in the range of 10 to 50  mev per tm . </S>",
    "<S> these are orders of magnitude larger than the values for @xmath3 tms , irrespective of whether they are arranged in bulk , thin films or multilayers . </S>",
    "<S> similar colossal mae magnitude has been reported for the free - standing @xmath1 and @xmath0 tm chains  @xcite as well as dimers of tms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic for the colossal mae  @xcite is the significant contribution from the variation of magnetic moments and corresponding magnetization energies when changing the direction of @xmath11 , a contribution that is absent for conventional @xmath3 magnets . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for 4@xmath84 w on graphene , this variation of the spin moment reaches as much as 0.1@xmath10 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) . by looking at the mae values as the function of the band filling and deposition density in fig .  2b , we find that , in contrast to the spin moments , the mae exhbits a much more irregular behavior as a function of the band filling and depends much more sensitively on the adatom density . e.g.  for w the mae changes sign depending on the density of adatoms , and has a small value in the 4@xmath84 geometry . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation provides a possibility to manipulate the magnetization direction with weak external perturbations , which can be particularly important for transport applications as we demonstrate below .    in search for ability to manipulate the magnetic properties of adatoms by external fields , </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 the dependence of the spin moments and the mae of w adatoms in 4@xmath84 geometry on the strength of the electric field @xmath12 , applied perpendicularly to the graphene layer ( along the @xmath13-axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the spin moment of w displays a strong dependence on the field strength , especially when the magnetization points out of plane . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , this response can be characterized by a magnetoelectric coefficient @xmath14 , which relates the change in the spin moment to the strength of the @xmath12-field in the zero - field situation : @xmath15(w ) @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the vacuum magnetic permeability constant . </S>",
    "<S> for 4@xmath84 w on graphene and an out - of - plane magnetization , @xmath18 amounts to about @xmath19  g@xmath20cm@xmath9/v , which is one order of magnitude larger than that in fe thin films  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for an in - plane magnetization , the magnetoelectric coefficient @xmath22 is only @xmath23  g@xmath20cm@xmath9/v , i.e.   one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath18 , which underlines the strong anisotropy of this quantity . </S>",
    "<S> we observe similarly large variations of the magnetoelectric coupling strength in other considered @xmath0 tms . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of orbital moment with varying @xmath12-field is negligible for all systems .     </S>",
    "<S> adatoms on graphene . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) magnetic moments due to electron spin , @xmath24 , calculated without soc and ( b ) the mae of @xmath0 tm adatoms on graphene in 2@xmath82 , 3@xmath83 and 4@xmath84 superlattice geometry . </S>",
    "<S> positive ( negative ) values of mae imply an out - of - plane ( in - plane ) easy axis of the spin moments , i.e.  perpendicular to ( in ) the graphene plane.,width=317 ]     w on graphene on the strength of an external electric field . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) the spin moment of w adatoms @xmath24 ( in @xmath10 ) as a function of the strength of an external electric field @xmath12 , perpendicular to graphene surface , for the out - of - plane and in - plane magnetization , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> negative values of @xmath12 correspond to the electric field in @xmath25-direction ,  i.e.  the direction from graphene towards the adatoms . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) dependence of the mae on the strength of an external electric field @xmath12 , sign convention of mae is consistent to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . inset displays the difference of spin densities @xmath26 for the system without electric field and the case with a negative electric field of 0.13 v / .,width=317 ]        striking is the effect of the electric field on the magnetization direction ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) . at zero field ( @xmath27 ) </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization is in - plane . applying a negative field of magnitude of 0.05@xmath70.4  v /  , values typical in graphene field effect transistor structures  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the sign of the mae is changed . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the equilibrium direction of the magnetization can be switched from in - plane ( @xmath28 , for @xmath27 ) to out - of - plane ( @xmath29 for @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> supposing that the @xmath12-field is completely screened in our system by forming a screening charge @xmath31 , the variation of the mae with respect to @xmath31 , @xmath32 , reaches as much as 28 mev / e for negative electric fields , which is more than three times larger than that on the surface of copt slabs  @xcite , and one order of magnitude larger than that of fe slabs  @xcite . with a moderate out - of - plane electric field of @xmath330.13  v /   switching of the magnetization can be also achieved in 4@xmath84 hf , and the mae can be significantly altered in 4@xmath84 os on graphene ( by @xmath34 10  mev ) and 4@xmath84 ir on graphene ( by @xmath34 20  mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes @xmath0 tm adatoms on graphene as a class of magnetic hybrid materials with high susceptibility of magnetic properties to the electric field , thus making the electrical control of magnetism in these systems possible .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason for such a strong magnetoelectric response of @xmath0 tms on graphene can be exemplified for the case of w in 4@xmath84 geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the local w @xmath35- and @xmath2-decomposed density of electron states without soc , grouped into @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 contributions , is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a . </S>",
    "<S> as we can see , the w spin moment of about 1.6@xmath10 originates from two occupied spin - up and two unoccupied spin - down @xmath39-states , while the exchange - split @xmath40- and @xmath41-states are situated above and below @xmath42 , respectively , and almost do not contribute . upon </S>",
    "<S> including soc ( e.g.  for out - of - plane spins ) a strong hybridization between the @xmath43 , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 states of both spin occurs around @xmath42 ( see also fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) , which results in a formation of hybrid bands of mixed spin and orbital character , while the @xmath44 band remains mainly non - bonding ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) . </S>",
    "<S> when an electric field is applied along the @xmath13-axis , the states which experience most influence of the corresponding potential change are the @xmath44-states , directed perpendicularly to the graphene plane . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding modification of the band structures due to the electric fields can be seen in fig .  3c , where the @xmath44 band is shifted downwards ( upwards ) by negative ( positive ) applied @xmath12 fields , while the hybrid bands of mixed character remain almost unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the redistribution of the electrons in the @xmath44-states , its hybridization with the hybrid band below the fermi level and hence the variation of the magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> this can be visualized by the plot of the spin density difference @xmath45 for the case with @xmath12 = 0 and @xmath12 = @xmath70.13  v /   ( inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that , upon applying an electric field , a certain amount of spin density is transferred from the @xmath39 state of @xmath46 character to the @xmath40 states . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the difference in the hybridization with the graphene states , seen from the width of the corresponding peaks in the density of states , the @xmath39 and @xmath40 states have different localization inside the w atoms thus leading to a change in the spin moment .    </S>",
    "<S> at last we turn to the prediction of a stable qahe , a manifestation of the quantization of the transverse anomalous hall conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> it is motivated by the observation that for 4@xmath84 w on graphene with an out - of - plane magnetization , @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands of opposite spin cross ( see circles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) and hybridize under the presence of soc , forming a global band gap across the brillouin zone ( bz ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , 4@xmath84 w becomes an insulator upon a spin - orbit driven metal - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the anomalous hall conductivity of this system , given by @xmath47 , with @xmath48 as the chern number of all occupied bands that can be obtained as a @xmath49-space integral @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrand , @xmath51 , is the so - called berry curvature of all states below the fermi level : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the spinor bloch wavefunction of band @xmath54 with corresponding eigen energy @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the @xmath57th cartesian component of the velocity operator . the berry curvature in reciprocal space , presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3d , displays a comparatively complex pattern , with positive contributions concentrated along the bz boundary , and large negative dips at certain isolated @xmath49-points away from the high - symmetry points . </S>",
    "<S> such non - trivial distribution of the berry curvature , which plays a role of an effective magnetic field in the @xmath49-space , is typical for complex transition - metal compounds  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculated anomalous hall conductivity as a function of the electron filling expressed as energy @xmath58 relative to the fermi level is presented in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c for an out - of - plane magnetization , @xmath59 , and zero @xmath12-field . </S>",
    "<S> we indeed find that the chern number of all occupied states acquires an integer value of @xmath602 . </S>",
    "<S> according to the physics of the quantum hall effect , this will result in two dissipationless and topologically protected edge states on each side of a finite graphene ribbon with w adatoms . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , another 32  mev large qahe gap with the @xmath61 can be observed at the energy of @xmath70.27  ev below @xmath42 , originating from the soc - mediated hybridization between the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands of the same spin - up character , see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b and 3d . </S>",
    "<S> such a peculiar situation suggests that the topological properties of the qahe state in 4@xmath84 w on graphene can be controlled by tuning the position of @xmath42  e.g.  via  deposition on an appropriate substrate .    </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , at equilibrium the magnetization direction of 4@xmath84 w lies in - plane , rendering @xmath62 owing to the antisymmetric nature of the anomalous hall conductivity with respect to the magnetization direction . from our previous observations it follows , however , that the direction of @xmath11 can be conveniently switched to out - of - plane by applying a moderate electric field without any significant modification of the the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the gaps remain intact ( cf  fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) , its size unchanged , and the value of the anomalous hall conductivity remains quantized at both energies .    </S>",
    "<S> such non - trivial topological qahe states occur also for all other @xmath0 adatoms ( except pt ) on graphene in 4@xmath84 geometry , and several of them in 2@xmath82 geometry , with the qahe gaps of comparable magnitude , although positioned away from the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> for example , graphene with re deposited in 4@xmath84 geometry exhibits three @xmath63 qahe gaps at @xmath71 , @xmath70.15 and @xmath600.67  ev , with the corresponding gap size of 38 , 63 and 98  mev , respectively . also , </S>",
    "<S> 4@xmath84 ir and os on graphene show two qahe gaps ( @xmath63 for ir and @xmath64 for os ) at 0.24 and 0.47  ev for ir , and @xmath70.38 and 0.15  ev for os , with corresponding gap size in between 11 and 80  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that several qahe gaps with different chern numbers at different energies can occur in the same material makes these systems a rich playground for topological transport studies . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic of such systems is the leading role of the @xmath0 orbitals and strong soc of heavy adatoms in determining the topological properties : as we can see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b , the creation of the qahe gaps can occur at the points in the brillouin zone away from high - symmetry points due to hybridization of bands with a strong tm character , which are significantly altered by the tms soc . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the cases considered previously  @xcite , in which the role of the magnetic adatoms is rather to insert a rashba spin - orbit or exchange fields on the dirac states at the fermi energy and high - symmetry points in the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , however , the strong soc of @xmath0 tms leads to an increase of the qahe gap by an order of magnitude , when compared to all qahe systems suggested before , guaranteeing a strong topological protection against defects , structural disorder or thermal fluctuations , and thus opening a route to qahe at room temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we predict that graphene decorated with @xmath0 transition - metals is a hybrid material displaying remarkable magnetic and transport properties , which may be utilized experimentally for the purposes of topological transport applications at reasonable temperatures and conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that heavy transition - metals deposited on graphene display very stable magnetism due to colossal magneto - crystalline anisotropies with exciting possibilities in engineering a robust quantum anomalous hall effect with a large band gap stems from the strong spin - orbit interaction of these elements . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme sensitivity of these hybrid systems to an electric field that we predicted is likely to be enhanced when graphene is deposited on a ferroelectric substrate . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath0-graphene hybrid materials provide a unique functionality in tailoring the required magnetic and topological properties , not likely to be achieved in conventional magnetic materials based on @xmath3 transition - metals . considering the breadth of this material class including other possible heavy adatoms , such as the @xmath1 tms or @xmath65-elements </S>",
    "<S> , we anticipate that room temperature qahe may become possible in these systems and we encourage intense experimental research on these materials . </S>"
