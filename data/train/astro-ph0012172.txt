    "as ground  based interferometric gravitational  wave observatories approach the end of their construction phase , there is increased interest in predictions for the detection of cosmic sources of gravitational waves .",
    "the late stages of the inspiral of compact object binaries are considered to be one of the most prominent sources of gravitational radiation in the frequency band relevant to ligo , virgo , and geo  600 ( @xmath1hz ) .",
    "inspiral detection rates depend on the strength of the gravitational  wave signal , the instrument sensitivity and detection efficiency , and on the inspiral event rate out to the maximum distances of reach .",
    "estimates of galactic coalescence rates have been obtained in two ways : ( 1 ) based on theoretical calculations of binary compact object formation using population synthesis techniques ( e.g. , portegies  zwart & yungelson 1998 ; bethe & brown 1998 ; fryer , woosley , & hartmann 1999 ; belczynski & bulik 1999 ) .",
    "the predicted rates span a wide range of values ( covering at least 3 orders of magnitude ) , primarily because of uncertainties in the evolutionary sequences ( e.g. , supernova kicks , black hole formation , etc . ) , which strongly affect the absolute normalization of the population synthesis results ( for a recent review , see kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "( 2 ) for the case of double neutron star systems ( ns  ns ) , empirical estimates based on the observed sample of recycled binary pulsars are possible ( e.g. , narayan , piran , & shemi 1991 ; phinney 1991 ; curran & lorimer 1995 ; arzoumanian et al .",
    "1998 ; kalogera et al .",
    "such estimates have proven a lot more accurate , although uncertainties of about 2 orders of magnitude persist ( kalogera et al .",
    "2000 ) , because of the small number of observed ns ",
    "ns binaries .",
    "in this paper we report on a newly discovered formation path , which produces ns  ns binaries that _ do not _ contain a recycled pulsar .",
    "although the absolute formation rate of such binaries is subject to the known population synthesis uncertainties , the identification of the path alone and the _ relative _ formation rate imply important upward revisions for the rates estimates based on the current observed sample . in ",
    "2 we describe our model calculations and in  3 we analyze our results for the new ns  ns formation path .",
    "we discuss possible observational tests and implications for gravitational  wave detection in  4 .",
    "we study ns  ns binaries formed through a multitude of evolutionary sequences that are not predefined , but instead are realized in monte carlo population synthesis calculations . in what follows",
    ", we give a brief description of our population synthesis code .",
    "more details about the treatment of various evolutionary processes are presented in belczynski , kalogera , & bulik ( 2000 ) .    to describe the evolution of single or non  interacting binary stars ( hydrogen and helium  rich ) from the zero age main sequence ( zams ) to carbon ",
    "oxygen ( co ) core formation , we employ the analytical formulae of hurley , pols , & tout ( 2000 ) , whose results are in good agreement with earlier stellar models ( e.g. , schaller et al .  1992 ) . to calculate masses of compact objects formed at core  collapse events ,",
    "we have adopted a prescription based on the relation between co core masses and final feni core masses ( woosley 1986 ) .",
    "our progenitor  remnant mass relation is in agreement with the results of fryer & kalogera ( 2000 ) based on hydrodynamical calculations of core collapse of massive stars .    concerning the evolution of interacting binaries , we model the changes of mass and orbital parameters ( separation and eccentricity ) taking into account mass and angular momentum transfer between the stars or loss from the system during roche  lobe overflow , tidal circularization , rejuvenation of stars due to mass accretion , wind mass loss from massive and/or evolved stars , dynamically unstable mass transfer episodes leading to common  envelope ( ce ) evolution and spiral  in of the stars",
    ". we extend the usual treatment of ce evolution based on energy considerations ( webbink 1984 ) to include cases where both stars have reached the giant branch and have convective envelopes ( hydrogen or low  mass helium stars ) . as suggested by brown ( 1995 ) for hydrogen  rich stars , we expect the two cores to spiral  in until a merger occurs or the combined stellar envelopes are ejected",
    ". we also account for the _ possibility _ that compact objects accrete mass during ce phases ( following brown 1995 ) . at ns formation , we model the effects of asymmetric supernovae ( sn ) on binaries , i.e. , mass loss and natal kicks , for both circular and eccentric orbits ( e.g. , kalogera 1996 ; portegies  zwart & verbunt 1996 ) .",
    "we assume that kicks are isotropic with a given magnitude distribution .    in the synthesis calculations ,",
    "we evolve a population of primordial binaries and single stars through a large number of evolutionary stages , until _ coalescing _ ns  ns are formed ( merger times @xmath2gyr ) .",
    "the total number of binaries ( typically a few million ) in each simulation is determined by the requirement that the statistical ( poisson ) fractional errors ( @xmath3 ) of the final ns ",
    "ns population are lower than 10% .",
    "the formation rates are calibrated using the latest type ii sn empirical rates and normalized to our galaxy ( cappellaro , evans , & turatto 1999 ) .    in our standard model ,",
    "the properties of primordial binaries follow certain assumed distributions : for primary masses ( @xmath4m@xmath5 ) , @xmath6 ; for mass ratios ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 ; for orbital separations ( from a minimum , so both zams stars fit within their roche lobes , up to @xmath9r@xmath5 ) , @xmath10 ; for eccentricities , @xmath11 . each of the models is also characterized by a set of assumptions , which , for our standard model , are : ( 1 ) _ kick velocities .",
    "_ we use a weighted sum of two maxwellian distributions with @xmath12kms@xmath13 ( 80% ) and @xmath14kms@xmath13 ( 20% ) ( cordes & chernoff 1997 ) ; ( 2 ) _ maximum ns mass .",

    "we assume that star formation has been continuous in the disk of our galaxy for the last 10gyr ( e.g. , gilmore 2001 ) .",

    "we describe in detail the formation of a typical ns ",
    "ns binary through this new channel .",
    "the evolution begins with two phases of roche  lobe overflow .",
    "the first , from the primary to the secondary , involves non  conservative but dynamically stable mass transfer ( stage ii ) and ends when the hydrogen envelope is consumed .",
    "the second , from the initial secondary to the helium core of the initial primary , involves dynamically unstable mass transfer , i.e. , ce evolution ( stage iv ) .",
    "the post  ce binary consists of two bare helium stars of relatively low masses .",
    "as they evolve through core and shell helium burning , the two stars acquire `` giant  like '' structures , with developed co cores and convective envelopes ( e.g. , habets 1987 ) .",
    "their radial expansion eventually brings them into contact and the system evolves through a double ce phase ( stage vi ; similar to brown ( 1995 ) for hydrogen  rich stars ) . during this double ce phase ,",
    "the combined helium envelopes are ejected at the expense of orbital energy .",
    "the tight , post  ce system consists of two co cores , which eventually end their lives as type ic supernovae .",
    "the survival probability after the two supernovae is quite high , given the tight orbit before the explosions .",
    "the end product in this example is a close ns ",
    "ns with a merger time of @xmath32myr ( typical merger times are found in the range @xmath33yr ) .",
    "the unique qualitative characteristic of this ns ",
    "ns formation path is that both ns have avoided recycling .",
    "the ns progenitors have lost both their hydrogen and helium envelopes prior to the two supernovae , so no accretion from winds or roche  lobe overflow is possible after ns formation .",
    "consequently , these systems are detectable as radio pulsars only for a time ( @xmath34yr ) much shorter than recycled ns  ns pulsar lifetimes ( @xmath35yr in the observed sample ) .",
    "such short lifetimes are of course consistent with the number of ns ",
    "ns binaries detected so far and the absence of any _ non  recycled _ pulsars among them .    given the uncertain absolute normalization of population synthesis models , we focus primarily on the formation rate of non  recycled ns ",
    "ns binaries _ relative _ to that of recycled pulsars , formed through other , qualitatively different evolutionary paths . based on this comparison , for each of our models ,",
    "we derive a correction factor for empirical estimates of the galactic ns ",
    "ns coalescence rate .",
    "since these estimates are derived based on the observed sample , they can account only for ns ",
    "ns systems with recycled pulsars , and they must be increased to include any non  recycled systems formed .    in table 2",
    "we present the formation rates of non  recycled ns ",
    "ns binaries and the total ns ",
    "ns population with merger times shorter than 10gyr , along with the upwards correction factor for the galactic empirical rate estimates .",
    "this factor is to be equal to : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the rate of all coalescing ns ",
    "ns binaries , and @xmath38 is the rate of coalescing non  recycled ns ",
    "the correction factor implies an increase , of the rate estimates of coalescing ns ",
    "ns systems , assuming the rate is based only on the recycled ns  ns population ( @xmath39 ) . in our calculations",
    "we classify as non  recycled only those ns ",
    "ns binaries which are formed through a double helium ce phase and have no chance of ns accretion and recycling .",
    "other ns  ns systems formed through channels that do not involve a double helium ce phase may have been recycled , but we can not be certain , considering our limited understanding of the recycling process . we therefore classify them as recycled pulsars . due to this conservative assumption , we probably overestimate the rate of recycled ns - ns , relative to the rate of non - recycled ns ",
    "ns and , as it is evident from equation ( 1 ) , underestimate the correction factor that should multiply the rates derived from the observed galactic sample of recycled ns  ns . in table 2",
    "we show results only for models where the derived factor differs from our standard model by more than 25% .",
    "we find that these factors are typically @xmath40 but can be even higher ( 10 or more ) for some models .",
    "we note that we have extensively investigated the statistical accuracy of our results , their dependence on the total number of binaries modeled , and any correlations between the errors of the individual formation rates .",

    "ns with recycled and young pulsars can form at comparable rates and why this new formation path was not identified by previous studies .",
    "the formation of non  recycled systems depends crucially on the phase of double ce evolution of the two helium stars ( stage vi ) .",
    "this phase is very similar to the double ce phase of hydrogen  rich stars , suggested by brown ( 1995 ) to circumvent the problems of the `` standard '' ns ",
    "ns channel ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) with ns hyper",
    " critical accretion in ce phases .",
    "they both require that the stars in the primordial binary have very similar masses ( within about 7% ) , and that at the onset of the phase both envelopes are convective , i.e. , both stars have developed a `` giant  like '' structure .",
    "it turns out that the relative recycled ns ",
    "ns formation efficiency through brown s path is almost negligible ( @xmath43% of the total coalescing ns ",
    "ns population ) : most of the possible ns  ns progenitors",
    "either ( i ) get disrupted in the supernovae , or ( ii ) merge because our models account for helium  star evolution , or ( iii ) experience a double helium ce phase , as described above , and barring a merger , they form non  recycled ns  ns binaries ( this variation of the new formation path represents @xmath44% of all non  recycled ns ",
    "ns formed in model a ) .",
    "instead , we find that the majority of ns ",
    "ns with recycled pulsars form through the `` standard '' channel ( or variations of it ) . in comparison ,",
    "the newly identified path is favored , despite the mass constraints on the progenitors , because it produces very tight pre ",
    "sn binaries that are hard to disrupt .",
    "as already mentioned , the realization of the newly identified path through a double helium ce phase depends on the final stages of a helium star evolution .",
    "it has long been known that low mass helium stars , after core helium exhaustion , expand significantly and develop a `` giant - like '' structure with a clearly defined core and a convective envelope ( delgado , & thomas 1981 ; habets 1987 ; avila - reese 1993 ; woosley , langer , & weaver 1995 ; hurley et al .",
    "we further examined in detail models of evolved helium stars ( woosley 1997 , private communication ) and found that helium stars below 4.0m@xmath5 have deep convective envelopes and that slightly more massive helium stars ( @xmath45 44.5m@xmath5 ) still form convective envelopes although shallower . evolved stars with convective envelopes , overfilling roche lobes in binary systems , transfer mass on a dynamical time scale , and as a consequence ce evolution ensues .",
    "the development of ce phases was proposed first in the context of cataclysmic variable formation ( paczynski 1976 ) and is now supported by detailed hydrodynamical calculations in a variety of binary configurations ( e.g. rasio & livio 1996 ; taam & sandquist 2000 and references therein ) . at present no hydro calculations exist for the case of two evolved stars . based on our basic understanding of ce development , it seems reasonable to expect that , if two stars with convective envelopes are involved in a mass transfer episode , a double core spiral - in can occur leading to double ce ejection ( brown 1995 ) .",
    "based on these earlier calculations , we adopt a maximum helium  star mass for ce evolution ( double or single ) of 4.5m@xmath5 .",
    "the formation rates of both types of ns ",
    "ns binaries are somewhat sensitive to this value , because they depend on whether helium stars evolve through ce phases ( single and double , for recycled and non - recycled systems , respectively ) . reducing the maximum mass to 4m@xmath5 actually increases the rate correction factor , although by less than 20% , as it reduces the recycled ns",
    " ns rate by a factor larger than the non  recycled rate .",
    "the most important model parameters can be inferred from table 2 . in the `` standard '' ns ",
    "ns formation channel ( or variations of it ) ce evolution for ns is invoked . since we do allow for ns hyper ",
    "critical accretion in ce phases , the ns ",
    "ns formation efficiency through this channel strongly depends on the assumed maximum ns mass .",
    "for example , in model d2 where @xmath46m@xmath5 ( motivated by soft ns equations of state ) , the `` standard '' channel _ always _ leads to bh  ns instead of ns ",
    "ns formation . at the other extreme",
    ", model c ( no hyper  critical accretion allowed ) favors the `` standard '' channel and decreases the correction factor ( albeit only slightly , by @xmath47% , because of the large @xmath48 in model a ) .",
    "as shown in table 2 , a reduction of the ce efficiency leads to an overall reduction in the total ns ",
    "ns rate , as expected . in general",
    ", sn kicks comparable to the pre  sn orbital velocities favor the formation of coalescing ns ",
    "ns ( fryer & kalogera 1997 ) by reducing orbital separations .",
    "however , this is not needed for non  recycled systems , since their pre  sn separations are already very tight .",
    "consequently , the zero kicks model ( b1 ) strongly disfavors ns  ns formation through the `` standard '' channel ( reduced by 80% ) . on the other hand , in the absence of kicks",
    "non  recycled systems are favored , because none of them are disrupted after the explosions ( typical mass loss is too low ) .",
    "these combined effects lead to a high value of the rate correction factor ( 10 ) . as the kick magnitude increases , the rates for the two ns ",
    "ns groups approach a balance ( correction factor of @xmath49 ) . for a kick distribution with a fraction of low",
    " magnitude kicks larger than in a maxwellian ( `` paczynski '' kicks , @xmath50^{-1}$ ] ; see portegies ",
    "zwart & yungelson 1998 ) , the advantages and disadvantages for each channel are balanced , so the correction factor is equal to that in model a ( within the statistical accuracy @xmath51% ) . for all other models we examined ( table 1 ) that are not listed in table 2 ,",
    "the change in the correction factor was found to be smaller than 25% from model a.    we note that the identification of the formation path for non  recycled ns ",
    "ns binaries stems entirely from accounting for the evolution of helium stars and for the possibility of double ce phases , both of which have typically been ignored in previous calculations ( with the exception of fryer et al .  1999 , although formation paths for non  recycled ns ",
    "ns were not discussed ) .",
    "we have identified a new possible evolutionary path leading to the formation of close ns ",
    "ns binaries , with the unique characteristic that both ns have avoided recycling by accretion .",
    "the realization of this path is related to the evolution of helium  rich stars , and particularly to the radial expansion and development of convective envelopes ( on the giant branch ) of low  mass ( @xmath52m@xmath5 ) helium stars .",
    "we find that a significant fraction of coalescing ns ",
    "ns form through this new channel , for a very wide range of model parameters . in some cases , the non  recycled ns ",
    "ns systems strongly dominate the total close ns ",
    "ns population ( tables 1 , 2 ) .    since both ns are non  recycled , their pulsar lifetimes are too short ( by @xmath0 ) , and hence their detection probability is negligible relative to recycled ns ",
    "however , intermediate progenitors of these systems may provide evidence in support of the evolutionary sequence .",
    "examples are close binaries with two low  mass helium stars or a helium star with an o , b companion .",
    "although there are selection effects against their detection too ( e.g. , short lifetimes , high  mass helium stars are brighter , broad spectral lines due to winds , high luminosity contrast between binary members , etc . ) , it has been estimated that so far only about 1% of binary helium stars have been detected ( vrancken et al.1991 ) .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that the observed sample will increase in future years as observational techniques improve .",
    "it is worth noting that theoretical calculations indicate that explosions of low ",
    "mass helium stars formed in binaries reproduce the light curves of type ib supernovae ( shigeyama et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the results of our population modeling show that , if one accounts for the formation of non  recycled ns ",
    "ns binaries , the total number of coalescing ns - ns systems could be higher by factors of at least 50% , and up to 10 or even higher .",
    "such an increase has important implications for prospects of gravitational wave detection by ground  based interferometers . using the results of kalogera et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on the empirical ns ",
    "ns coalescence rate , we find that their _ most optimistic _ prediction for the ligo i detection rate could be raised to at least 1 event per 23 years , and their _ most pessimistic _ ligo ii detection rate could be raised to 34 events per year or even higher .",
    "our results also have important implications for gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) , if they are associated with ns  ns coalescence .",
    "we find that the typical merger times of the non  recycled ns ",
    "ns are considerably shorter than those of recycled binaries , whereas their center  of  mass velocities are higher .",
    "the balance of these two competing effects could alter the current consensus for the location of grb progenitors relative to their host galaxies ( e.g. , belczynski , bulik , & rudak 2000 ; bloom , kulkarni , & djorgovski 2000 ; fryer et al .",
