    "despite decades of continuing effort , the nature of the progenitor systems of type ia supernovae ( sne ) remains unknown .",
    "the most widely accepted theoretical scenarios involve the thermonuclear explosion of a c+o white dwarf ( wd ) destabilized by accretion of material from a binary companion , either another wd ( double degenerate systems , dds ) or a normal star ( single degenerate systems , sds ) .",
    "observations of supernova rates in distant galaxies suggest at least two different ways to produce type ia sne @xcite : a ` prompt ' channel associated with young stellar populations and a ` delayed ' channel associated with old stellar populations . at present , it is not clear what relationship , if any , these channels have with the theoretical scenarios , or even if the proposed scenarios can yield type ia sne at the observed rate @xcite .",
    "most attempts to constrain the fundamental properties of the progenitors have been unsuccessful , including direct identification in optical pre - explosion images @xcite , searches for h stripped from the binary companion in sn spectra @xcite , and searches for prompt emission from circumstellar interaction @xcite .",
    "very recently , the possible identification of the progenitor in a pre - explosion x - ray image of sn 2007on by @xcite has been questioned by post - explosion images @xcite .",
    "campaigns to look for the surviving companion star to the exploded wd in the nearby tycho supernova remnant ( snr ) , known to be of type ia origin , have also produced controversial results @xcite .",
    "this lack of clues to the identity of the progenitors in the observations of type ia sne is sometimes referred to as ` stellar amnesia ' .",
    "one of the most important constraints on the age and nature of the progenitor systems is their metallicity @xmath3 . during stellar evolution , the c , n , and o that act as catalysts for the cno cycle pile up into @xmath4n , which is converted to @xmath5ne in the hydrostatic he burning phase through the reactions @xmath4n(@xmath0,@xmath6)@xmath7f(@xmath8,@xmath9)@xmath7o(@xmath0,@xmath6)@xmath5ne .",
    "the @xmath8 decay of @xmath7f increases the neutron excess of the wd material , defined as @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the atomic number and @xmath12 is the mass number ) , resulting in a linear scaling of @xmath13 with metallicity : @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this can have an observable impact on type ia supernova spectra @xcite , but the predicted effects are hard to detect in practice ( in one case , sn 2005bl , a progenitor of subsolar metallicity has been suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this _",
    "letter _ , we describe a new direct method to measure the metallicity of type ia sn progenitors using mn and cr lines from shocked ejecta in the x - ray spectra of snrs .",
    "nuclear burning in type ia sne happens in different regimes depending on the peak temperature reached by the wd material . from higher to lower temperatures , the regimes are : nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , incomplete si burning , incomplete o burning and incomplete c - ne burning @xcite . during the explosion itself , electron captures are too slow to change the original value of @xmath13 except in the innermost @xmath16 of ejecta , where nuclear burning happens at higher densities , leading to neutron - rich nse @xcite . outside this region",
    ", an imbalance between free neutrons and protons does not affect the production of the most abundant species , with the possible exception of @xmath17ni at supersolar metallicities @xcite . however , some trace nuclei with unequal numbers of protons and neutrons are very efficient at storing the neutron excess .",
    "the most abundant among these nuclei is @xmath18mn , which is produced during incomplete si burning as @xmath18co .",
    "when normalized to another product of incomplete si burning whose nucleosynthesis is insensitive to the neutron excess ( cr is the ideal choice ) , the yield of mn becomes an excellent tracer of the progenitor metallicity .    ) in wds with main sequence progenitor masses of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ( see   [ sub : simmering ] ) .",
    "the horizontal solid and dotted lines represent the estimated @xmath15 ratio in the tycho snr from the _ suzaku _",
    "observations ( @xmath21 , shaded in gray ) , which corresponds to @xmath1 ( see   [ sec : zoftycho ] ) . [ fig-1 ] ]    this diagnostic can be quantified with type ia sn explosion models .",
    "we have used the model grid from @xcite , complemented with other models calculated with the code described in @xcite .",
    "physical inputs and initial conditions are as in @xcite , except in the cases noted below .",
    "we consider examples of several explosion mechanisms : deflagrations , delayed detonations , and pulsating delayed detonations .",
    "for the present work , we have recalculated the nucleosynthesis of four delayed detonation models ( ddta , ddtc , ddte , and ddtf ) at different metallicities by altering the value of @xmath22 in the pre - explosion wd from the canonical @xmath23 ( corresponding to @xmath24 ) .",
    "we have also calculated one deflagration model starting from a central density twice as large as the other models , and one delayed detonation model with the c to o mass ratio @xmath25 in the wd instead of the usual 1 . in spite of these fundamental differences in explosion mechanisms and initial conditions , we find a very tight correlation between the mn to cr mass ratio outside the neutron - rich nse region in the sn ejecta , @xmath15 , and the progenitor metallicity @xmath3 ( see figure [ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "a power - law fit yields the following relation ( with a correlation coefficient @xmath26 ) :    @xmath27    removal of the inner @xmath28 of neutron - rich nse material from this relation is justified because ( 1 ) there is observational evidence that this material does not mix outwards during the explosion @xcite or its aftermath @xcite ; and ( 2 ) the dynamical ages of most ejecta - dominated type ia snrs are too small for the reverse shock to have reached so deep into the ejecta . for illustration ,",
    "we have plotted in figure [ fig-1 ] the core collapse sn models from @xcite , which also show some correlation between @xmath15 and @xmath3 , albeit with a much larger spread and a much shallower slope .      in order for eq .",
    "[ eq-1 ] to hold , the value of @xmath13 set by the progenitor metallicity must remain unchanged between the formation of the wd and the sn explosion .",
    "this should be true for dd progenitors if the final merger and runaway happen on dynamical timescales . in slowly accreting wds",
    ", @xmath13 can be modified through electron captures during the so - called ` simmering ' phase of non - explosive c burning that takes place in the @xmath29 yr prior to the explosion @xcite . the impact of this additional neutronization on the @xmath15 ratio will depend on the extent of the convective region over which the neutronized material is mixed ( @xmath30 ) , and its overlap with the portion of the wd that will undergo incomplete si burning where mn and cr are synthesized .     during the simmering phase ( left axis , black plots ) and its overlap with the si rich region of ejecta ( right axis , colored plots ) as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the black plots represent quadratic interpolations for different @xmath31 : @xmath19 ( dashed ) , @xmath32 ( dotted ) , and @xmath20 ( solid ) , with the symbols indicating the values from @xcite ( for @xmath33 at @xmath34 , we have taken the average between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "the colored plots represent the overlap ( in @xmath37 ) between @xmath30 and the si - rich region of ejecta , for very subluminous ( @xmath38 , red ) , mildly subluminous ( @xmath39 , orange ) , and normal , but faint ( @xmath40 , blue ) type ia sne . [ fig-2 ] ]    some previous studies @xcite have found large values for @xmath30 by assuming an homogeneous chemical composition for the wd , effectively applying the schwarzschild criterion for convection .",
    "we will adopt the hypothesis that the convective region is limited by the ledoux criterion to the c - depleted core of the wd created during hydrostatic he - shell burning , @xmath41 @xcite . in the absence of a self - consistent picture for convection inside wds",
    ", this must remain an open issue ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) , but we believe that our hypothesis is reasonable given the existence of other processes that can reduce the extent of @xmath30 and limit the mixing of neutronized material .",
    "these include the presence of urca shells @xcite and the long thermal diffusion time scale for buoyant bubbles larger than @xmath42 m @xcite , which prevents them from mixing completely with their surroundings during convection .     line .",
    "the k@xmath0 lines of cr and mn are detected at @xmath43 and @xmath44 confidence levels , with fluxes of @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively @xcite .",
    "[ fig-3 ] ]    according to @xcite , si - rich ejecta in type ia sne lie between lagrangian mass coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the light curve width parameter ( defined as the decline in blue magnitude 15 days after maximum ) , which acts as a proxy for sn brightness . in this context , the extent of the overlap between @xmath30 and the si - rich ejecta depends on the main sequence mass @xmath31 and initial metallicity of the wd progenitor ( which determine @xmath41 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sn brightness ( see figure [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "this overlap is only significant for subluminous ( @xmath50 ) type ia sne originated by progenitors with either large @xmath31 or low @xmath3 , or both .",
    "@xcite find an upper limit for the increase of @xmath13 during the simmering phase of @xmath51 , which is comparable to the value of @xmath13 in solar material .",
    "the impact of simmering on the @xmath15 ratio can then be estimated by mixing material with @xmath52 ( appropriate for the value of @xmath53 derived by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) into the incomplete si burning region , in a proportion equivalent to the extent of the overlap shown in figure [ fig-2 ] .",
    "the green and orange plots in figure [ fig-1 ] are two examples of such ` simmering - modified ' models for very subluminous",
    "( @xmath54 ) type ia sne , illustrating our conclusion that c simmering will only modify the @xmath15 ratio in the sn ejecta for very subluminous sne , and then only in cases where @xmath31 is large , or @xmath3 is low , or both .",
    "the work in this _",
    "letter _ is motivated by the recent _ suzaku _  detection of mn and cr in the x - ray spectrum of the tycho sn reported by @xcite ( see figure [ fig-3 ] ) .",
    "this observational result opens the possibility of studying the @xmath15 ratio in type ia sn ejecta , which can not be done using optical sn spectra due to the 2.7 yr half - life of @xmath18fe in the decay chain @xmath18co@xmath55fe@xmath55mn .",
    "since mn and cr are synthesized together in the explosion and have very similar electronic structures , it is possible to estimate their mass ratio from the line flux ratio : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the ratio of atomic masses , @xmath58 is the line flux ratio , and @xmath59 is the ratio of specific emissivities per ion",
    ".     emissivity ratio as a function of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the dotted box encompasses the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 found in the si - rich ejecta of six young type ia snrs by @xcite : @xmath62 ; @xmath63 .",
    "the striped area corresponds to the region of parameter space appropriate for the tycho snr , @xmath64 ; @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig-4 ] ]    public data bases for x - ray astronomy do not usually include lines from trace elements like mn and cr , but the value of @xmath59 can be estimated by interpolation along the atomic number sequence from elements with available data @xcite .",
    "we have used the atomdb data base @xcite to retrieve k@xmath0 line emissivities for si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni ( @xmath66 ) as a function of ionization timescale @xmath60 and electron temperature @xmath61 , the two variables that control the line emission of a plasma in nonequilibrium ionization .",
    "then we performed a spline interpolation to obtain @xmath59 , which we plot in figure [ fig-4 ] , together with the region of the @xmath67 parameter space that is populated by young type ia snrs ( see the appendix in * ? ? ?",
    "the uncertainty in the value of @xmath59 comes from the variation within this region and the error introduced by the interpolation itself , which we have estimated by comparing the true and interpolated values for the @xmath68 ratio . for the larger region of the @xmath67 plane",
    "plotted in figure [ fig-4 ] , we find @xmath69 ( @xmath70 for the smaller region appropriate for tycho ) .",
    "from the _ suzaku _  observation , @xmath71 , which gives @xmath72 .",
    "this mass ratio translates into a metallicity of @xmath73 for the progenitor of the tycho snr ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the large error bar in this result is dominated by the statistical uncertainties in the x - ray fluxes from the faint mn and cr lines , and it will be reduced in an upcoming , approved deeper _ suzaku_observation . at present , we find a strong indication for a supersolar metallicity ( @xmath74 with the solar value from @xcite ; @xmath2 with the newer value from @xcite ) .",
    "our results are compatible with a solar metallicity , but subsolar values can be discarded with confidence . given this measurement and the fact that tycho s sn was probably either normal or slightly overluminous @xcite",
    ", we do not have to concern ourselves with the impact of neutronization during c simmering in this particular case .",
    "the tycho snr is @xmath75 above the galactic plane at a galactocentric radius of @xmath76 ( assuming a distance of @xmath77 , * ? ? ?",
    "a supersolar metallicity is higher than average for this location , but well within the spread of measured @xmath78}$ ] values @xcite .",
    "this combination of galactrocentric radius and metallicity suggests a young progenitor age ( a few gyr or less ) , which would make tycho a candidate for the ` prompt ' channel of type ia sne , but the scatter in the age - metallicity relations and the uncertainties in our measurement are too large to be more specific on this point .    in this _",
    ", we have proposed a new method to measure the metallicity of type ia sn progenitors using mn and cr lines in the x - ray spectra of their snrs .",
    "we have applied it to the tycho snr and obtained a strong indication that its progenitor had a solar or supersolar metallicity .",
    "the main strength of our method is its simplicity : it is based on well - known nuclear physics and observable parameters that are easy to measure .",
    "detection of mn and cr lines in other young type ia snrs in the galaxy should be possible with _ suzaku _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "a few additional snrs in the magellanic clouds might be reached with deep exposures , bringing the total of potential targets to perhaps a dozen .",
    "this number would increase significantly with the inclusion of snrs in nearby galaxies like m31 and m33 , which may be accessible to next generation x - ray observatories like _ constellation - x _ and _ xeus_. even with a small sample of objects , we should be able to use this method to verify and complement the indirect metallicity studies of extragalactic type ia sne @xcite and test claims about the metallicity dependence of the type ia sn rate @xcite .",
    "measurements or upper limits below a certain threshold ( @xmath79 ) would also provide interesting constraints on the extent of the convective region in accreting wds .",
    "we conclude by noting that mn and cr lines have already been detected by _",
    "asca _ in the galactic snr w49b @xcite .",
    "the measured line flux ratio also suggests a solar or supersolar progenitor metallicity , but both the age and the sn type of w49b are controversial @xcite .",
