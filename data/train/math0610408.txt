    "since the discovery of quasicrystals some 20 years ago , mathematicians and physicists have gained a reasonable understanding of aperiodically ordered systems , in particular of those obtained from the projection method .",
    "such sets are called cut and project sets , or model sets @xcite",
    ". these are delone sets of finite local complexity with respect to translations , which also means that any finite patch occurs in finitely many orientations only .",
    "much less is known about aperiodically ordered systems with local patches occurring in infinitely many orientations , such as the pinwheel tiling of the plane or its three - dimensional counterpart , see @xcite and references therein . arguably , these are closer to amorphous systems , but still perfectly ordered . to our knowledge , no mathematically satisfactory frame for the analysis of radially symmetric systems and the comparison of their spectral properties has been developed so far .",
    "it is the aim of this contribution to show first steps in this direction , by combining results and methods from discrete geometry with the more recent approach of mathematical diffraction theory .",
    "our guiding examples are the square lattice and the pinwheel tiling of the plane .",
    "the diffraction of the square lattice is well understood , and it is not difficult to get some insight into its powder diffraction .",
    "the latter emerges from the presence of many grains in random mutual orientations , and thus requires a setting with circular symmetry .",
    "circular symmetry is also a fundamental property of the pinwheel tiling , resp .",
    "its compact hull .",
    "this tiling has recently been reinvestigated from the autocorrelation and diffraction point of view @xcite .",
    "however , hardly any explicit calculation exists in the literature , the reason being the enigmatic nature of the substitution generated pinwheel tiling .",
    "new insight is gained by means of an alternative construction on the basis of a substitution rule with two distinct prototiles .",
    "this gives access to quantities such as frequencies ( hence also to the frequency module ) , distance sets and the ring structure of the diffraction measure .    in section  [ sec : rpsf ] , we derive a radial analogue of poisson s summation formula for tempered distributions , which is needed in the following analysis . in the last section",
    ", we outline the general structure by presenting a number of results .",
    "they are clearly distinguished according to their present status into theorems ( with proofs or references ) , claims ( with a sketch of the idea and a reference to future work ) and observations ( based on numerical or preliminary evidence ) . since our alternative substitution will no doubt enable other developments as well , we hope that further progress is stimulated by the results presented in this paper .",
    "a rotation through @xmath0 about the origin is denoted by @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is the closed ball of radius @xmath3 centred in @xmath4 .",
    "whenever we speak of an _ absolute frequency _ ( e.g. , of a point set ) ,",
    "we mean the average number per unit volume , whereas _ relative frequency _ of a subset of objects is used with respect to the entire number of objects .",
    "the absolute frequency of the points in a point set @xmath5 ( if it exists ) is also called the _ density _ of @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath6 .",

    "if @xmath9 is a locally finite point set , the corresponding _ dirac comb _ @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the normalised point ( or dirac ) measure in @xmath4 , is a well - defined measure .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "whenever we use fourier transform for measures below , we are working in the framework of tempered distributions @xcite .",
    "the diffraction pattern of an ideal crystal , supported on a point lattice @xmath14 , can be obtained by the poisson summation formula ( psf ) for lattice measures or dirac combs @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 for all @xmath17 is the dual lattice .",
    "the distribution - valued ( or measure - valued ) version follows from the classical psf , compare @xcite , via applying it to a ( compactly supported ) schwartz function .",
    "it is often used to derive the diffraction measure @xmath18 of a lattice periodic measure @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 a finite measure ) .",
    "one obtains the autocorrelation measure @xmath21 where @xmath22 with complex conjugation @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the diffraction measure @xmath25 see @xcite for details .",
    "our interest is to extend this approach to situations with circular ( or spherical ) symmetry .",
    "let us first consider the square lattice @xmath26 , and recall that its circular shells have radii precisely in the set @xmath27 this is the set of non - negative numbers whose squares are integers that contain primes @xmath28 only to even powers .",
    "moreover , on a shell of radius @xmath29 , one finds finitely many lattice points , their number being given by @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the number of ideals of norm @xmath32 in @xmath33 $ ] , the ring of gaussian integers .",
    "this is a multiplicative arithmetic function , thus specified completely by its values at prime powers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they are given by @xmath34 as @xmath26 is self - dual as a lattice , with @xmath35 , the psf simplifies to @xmath36 .",

    "by weyl s lemma @xcite , the sequence @xmath38 is uniformly distributed in @xmath39 .",
    "consider the sequence @xmath40 of measures defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the rotation through @xmath43 . if @xmath44 , the sequence @xmath45 is uniformly distributed on @xmath46 , again by weyl s lemma .",
    "observe that all lattices @xmath47 share the same set of possible shell radii , namely @xmath48 of .",

    "4.4 ) and references given there for details .",
    "however , in view of the rather delicate convergence properties , a direct verification via the psf seems a simpler approach .    observe that one can alternatively reduce the problem to one dimension and employ a hankel transform , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "this requires a separate treatment of the transformed measure at the origin in @xmath68-space . as this looks slightly artificial from the point of view of diffraction , we stick to ordinary fourier transform .    the version for a general lattice @xmath14 reads as follows , where , in analogy to @xmath56 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the number of points of @xmath71 and @xmath72 on centred shells @xmath46 of radius @xmath3 .    [ radpsf ]",

    "the intensity distribution in powder diffraction emerges from a collection of grains in random and mutually uncorrelated orientations .",
    "its precise theoretical description is difficult , compare @xcite and references therein .    here",
    ", we look into a rather simplistic approach that nevertheless captures the essence of the diffraction image . for simplicity , and for comparison with related pinwheel patterns , we explain this for the square lattice @xmath26 . instead of working with grains of finite size",
    ", we consider the superposition of entire lattices , with appropriate weights .",
    "moreover , we make the restriction that there is a common rotation centre for all lattices , which we choose to be the origin . as a first step ,",
    "let us take a look at @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a generic rotation ( by which we mean that it is _ not _ an element of the group of coincidence rotations @xmath92 , see @xcite for more on this concept ) .    [ diff2gitter ] let @xmath93 be a generic rotation , so that @xmath94",
    ". then , the autocorrelation of @xmath95 is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the lebesgue measure in @xmath98 .",
    "the diffraction measure of @xmath99 is @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 for all  @xmath103 .",
    "the first two terms in are the autocorrelations of @xmath104 and of @xmath105 .",
    "the third term originates from the cross - correlation between them , where we used the identity @xmath106 with the limit being taken in the vague topology .",
    "this identity can be derived as follows .",
    "it is easy to see that each square in the square lattice is hit by @xmath107 exactly once , if @xmath4 is arbitrary but fixed and @xmath108 runs through @xmath109 .",
    "( the exception is @xmath110 , but we can neglect it since it plays no role in the limit . )",
    "thus each square in @xmath26 is hit with the same frequency in the limit . since @xmath61 is a generic rotation , the sequence @xmath111",
    "is uniformly distributed in the fundamental domain @xmath112 of @xmath26 , if @xmath4 is arbitrary but fixed and @xmath108 runs through @xmath113 .",
    "this is a consequence of the uniform distribution of @xmath114 in @xmath39 if @xmath0 is irrational .",
    "thus , the points in the sum above are uniformly distributed in @xmath98 in the limit , and the series converges in the vague topology to the lebesgue measure .",
    "now , equation follows immediately from @xmath115 and the psf .    for completeness ,",
    "let us briefly comment on the situation that @xmath116 . in this case",
    ", @xmath117 is a sublattice of @xmath26 of finite index , which is @xmath118 .",
    "it is possible to show that @xmath119 has diffraction @xmath120 the difference to the diffraction formula in lemma  [ diff2gitter ] is concentrated on @xmath121 , and hence plays no role in our further discussion when @xmath122 , which happens under multiple coincidence intersections @xcite .",
    "we may thus disregard coincidence rotations for our present purposes .",
    "let us continue by considering multiple intersections . if all rotations are generic ( in the sense that the lattices @xmath123 and @xmath124 are distinct apart from the origin ) and satisfy a uniform distribution property , we obtain the following result .",

    "this implies @xmath138 where @xmath101 and @xmath139 otherwise .",
    "consequently , one finds @xmath140 by theorem  [ radpsf ] in connection with weyl s lemma and the self - duality of @xmath26 , the term in the brackets converges to @xmath141 as @xmath142 .",
    "this simple argument shows that , after discarding the central intensity and multiplying the remainder by @xmath143 , one is left with a circular diffraction pattern in the spirit of the radial psf in theorem  [ radpsf ] . disregarding the central intensity",
    ", the shelling numbers @xmath56 reflect the total intensity , integrated over the rings of radius @xmath3 , in this idealized approach to powder diffraction .",
    "consequently , in a measurement that displays the intensity along a given direction , the resulting radial dependence is given by @xmath144 , compare figure  [ sqexact ] .",
    "the numerical approximation in figure  [ sqnum ] , included for later comparison , shows a strong oscillatory behaviour , as a result of summing bessel functions .",
    "note that this approximation disregards positivity in favour of including circular symmetry .",
    "the comparison gives a good impression on the overshooting that originates from this approach .",

    "_ global _ substitution that works on the specific @xmath174 defined above , compare @xcite for a discussion of the general substitution concept .",
    "the two tilings , @xmath171 and @xmath179 , are mutually locally derivable ( mld ) in the sense of @xcite .",
    "essentially , this means that one is obtained from the other by local replacement rules and vice versa .",
    "these rules are evident from figure  [ fig : subst ] .    as @xmath171 and @xmath179",
    "are mld , the global substitution @xmath20 also induces a _ local _ substitution in the sense of @xcite , where two ( oriented ) copies of the domino have to be distinguished . loosely speaking ,",
    "this follows from the observation that the local surrounding of any domino in @xmath179 or one of the other elements in the hull defined by @xmath179 determines the type of the domino , and hence how to apply the substitution to it .",
    "we equip @xmath173 with control points at @xmath180 , and @xmath174 with control points at @xmath181 .",

    "this specific discrete point set is a delone set , denoted by @xmath182 in the sequel .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath182 is mld with both @xmath171 and @xmath179 , even though one direction of the replacement rule is less obvious than the one linking @xmath171 and @xmath179 .",
    "observe that the relative and absolute frequencies of triangles @xmath148 in the pinwheel tiling are both equal to @xmath145 .",
    "for the relative frequencies , this is clear since there is only one prototile .",
    "the absolute frequency then follows from the fact that this prototile has area @xmath145 .",
    "every triangle of @xmath171 carries exactly one control point , so @xmath183 too . for the kite domino tiling , standard perron - frobenius theory yields the relative frequencies of kite ( resp .",
    "domino ) as @xmath184 ( resp .",
    "@xmath185 ) .",
    "thus , the absolute frequency of a kite ( resp .",
    "domino ) is @xmath186 ( resp .",
    "@xmath187 ) . the substitution matrix can be extracted from figure  [ fig : subst ] .",
    "discrete structures that are mld lead to dynamical systems that are topologically conjugate @xcite . therefore , we formulate the hull on the basis of the delone sets of the control points .",

    "this result is derived from the absolute frequencies of the vertex stars in the pinwheel tiling , see figure  [ fig : vertstars ] .",
    "these , in turn , can be derived from the frequencies of kites and darts in the kite domino tiling .",
    "details will be given in @xcite .",
    "we proceed by considering the fourier transform in relation to the distance set @xmath217 .",
    "since the fourier transform is continuous on the space @xmath57 of tempered distributions , becomes @xmath239 where the sum is to be understood in the distribution sense . by bochner",
    "s theorem , @xmath193 is again a positive and positive definite measure , and the equation can be understood as a vague limit as well .",
    "let us apply theorem  [ radpsf ] to the pinwheel pattern @xmath182 .",
    "according to claim  [ distsupset ] , the distances in @xmath217 arise from lattices of the form @xmath240 with @xmath241 .",
    "the corresponding dual lattices , which are relevant for the diffraction analysis , are @xmath242 , which have distance sets @xmath243 .",
    "since @xmath26 contains a lattice congruent to @xmath244 , it follows that @xmath245 for all @xmath218 , and that @xmath48 contains all distances that seem relevant from this point of view . at this stage",
    ", we have not found a compelling argument to exclude the possibility that certain subsets of @xmath182 contribute relevant distances in a coherent fashion , and thus  by unique ergodicity  further rings @xmath246 ( with @xmath247 ) to @xmath200 .",
    "however , on the basis of theorem  [ radpsf ] , it is at least plausible that the set @xmath204 is closely related with @xmath48 , or even equal to it . in this case",
    ", @xmath193 would show rings @xmath248 for @xmath29 only . according to claim [ allvalues ] , all distances have positive frequencies , so that this assumption would lead to @xmath249 with @xmath101 and @xmath250 for all @xmath29 .",
    "let us continue our discussion on the basis of this hypothesis .",
    "if observation  [ conj2 ] holds , then , for each @xmath251 , only finitely many distances of type @xmath220 are missing , each one contributing an absolutely continuous part to @xmath200 .",
    "since @xmath200 exists as a translation bounded measure , and since @xmath252 is already covered by the results above , every additional contribution has to contribute to @xmath253 .",
    "this motivates the conjecture that @xmath254 .",
    "observation  [ mainconj ] is also supported by numerical computations of @xmath200 .",
    "a naive numerical analysis of a large finite portion of @xmath182 would yield no relevant result due to the nature of the pinwheel pattern .",
    "in particular , the number of orientations grows only logarithmically with the radius , while the number of tiles grows quadratically .",
    "the results above allow a more meaningful computation .",
    "in particular , by employing the @xmath255-symmetry , the problem becomes one - dimensional , and by , the fourier transform is expressed explicitly as a sum of weighted bessel functions . as before , this approach disregards positivity of the intensity function , and the result displayed in figure  [ pin5 ] shows strong oscillations with significant overshooting , similar in kind to the ones observed in figure  [ sqnum ] .",
    "no smoothing of any kind was used .",
    "a comparison of the two diffraction images ( figures [ sqnum ] versus [ pin5 ] ) also supports our claim about the possible radii of pinwheel diffraction rings .",
    "one noticeable difference is the higher peak at @xmath256 , which is due to the pairs of points in @xmath182 with distance @xmath257 .",
    "the existence of positive shoulders in figure  [ pin5 ] ( such as that to the left of the first peak at @xmath258 , a blow - up of which is shown in figure  [ zoom6 ] ) is another significant difference to figure  [ sqnum ] , and is one of the reasons why we expect a non - vanishing radially continuous contribution , hence giving an absolutely continuous component to @xmath200 .",
