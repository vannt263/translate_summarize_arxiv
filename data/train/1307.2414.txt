    "recently the bes collaboration@xcite has claimed that a new resonance is observed in the invariance mass spectrum of @xmath13 by studying the process @xmath14 at @xmath15 gev , which is referred as @xmath0 with its mass and width being @xmath16 gev and @xmath17 mev respectively .",
    "the belle@xcite and cleo@xcite also reported the same new structure .",
    "since the resonance is charged it can not be a charmonium , but its mass and decay modes imply that it has a hidden charm - anticharm structure , therefore it must be an exotic state .",
    "in fact , before this discovery , two bottomonium - like charged resonances @xmath18 and @xmath19 were observed by belle@xcite and confirmed by babar @xcite . because they can not be bottomonia",
    ", a reasonable postulate is that they are exotic states with constituents of @xmath20 , e.g. they may be molecular states or tetraquarks etc .",
    "observation of similar charged meson @xmath0 indicates that at the charm energy range there exist similar exotic states .",
    "it intrigues enormous interests of theorists @xcite . for @xmath0",
    "some authors suggest it to be a molecular state@xcite , whereas some others think it as tetraquark or a mixture of the two states@xcite . which one is the true configuration ?",
    "the answer can only be obtained from experimental measurements .",
    "namely different structures would result in different decay rates for various channels .",
    "therefore , by assuming a special structure , we predict its decay rates for those possible modes , then the theoretical predictions will be tested by further more accurate measurements and their consistency with data would tell us if the postulation about the hadron structure is reasonable . in this paper",
    "we will study the strong decays of @xmath0 which is assumed to be a molecular state with the quantum number @xmath21 .",
    "assuming @xmath0 to have constituents of @xmath22 , we investigate the decays @xmath23 and @xmath24 under this assignment .    comparing with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath0 has the same light degrees of freedom , so that one may expect another resonance to exist around @xmath25 mev @xcite and it could be of the molecular structure of @xmath8 . with that assignment",
    "we calculate the decay rates of @xmath26 via the aforementioned decay modes for @xmath0 as well as @xmath8 because this channel is open at the energy 4030 mev within the same theoretical framework .    in this work",
    ", we will extend the light front quark model ( lfqm ) which was thoroughly studied in literature @xcite to investigate the decays of a molecular state .",
    "initially the authors@xcite constructed the light front quark model ( lfqm ) which is used to study processes where only mesons are involved .",
    "later cheng et .",
    "al . extended the framework to explore the decays of pentaquark@xcite .",
    "along the line we have extended the model to calculate the decay rates of baryons @xcite . with the lfqm ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are reasonably consistent with data , it implies that the applications of lfqm to various situations at charm and bottom energy regions are comparatively successful .",
    "this success inspires us to extend the light front model to study decays of molecular states .    in this approach",
    "the constituents are two mesons instead of a quark and an antiquark in the light front frame . in the covariant case",
    "the constituents are not on - shell .",
    "the effective interactions between the two concerned constituent mesons are that often adopted when one studies the effects of final state interactions@xcite .",
    "namely , by studying such processes , one can extract the effective coupling constants from the data .",
    "since for the molecular states the constituents and interactions are different from the case for quarks , we need to modify the lfqm and then apply the new version to study the exotic hadrons .",
    "in this paper we will deduce the form factors for the two - body decays of a molecular state of @xmath21 , and use them to estimate the decay widths of @xmath27 and @xmath28 by assuming @xmath0 to be a molecular state of @xmath24 , then we calculate the rates of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in our calculation , we keep the @xmath31 condition i.e. @xmath32 where one of the final mesons ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) is off - shell , thus the obtained form factors are space - like , i.e. unphysical .",
    "then an analytical extension from the space - like region to the time - like region is applied . letting the meson be on - shell one can get the physical form factor and calculate the corresponding decay widths .",
    "the numerical results will offer us information about the structure of @xmath0 and the possible @xmath26 .",
    "after the introduction we derive the form factor for transitions @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath35 and @xmath30 in section ii . then we numerically evaluate the relevant form factors and decay widths in sec .",
    "iii , where all input parameters are presented .",
    "at last we discuss the implications of the numerical results possibilities , then finally , we draw our conclusion even though it is not very definite so far .",
    "some details about the adopted approach are collected in the appendix .",
