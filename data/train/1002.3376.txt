    "one of the strongest predictions from our present cosmological paradigm , cold dark matter ( cdm ) , refers to the universal density profile shared by dark matter haloes on all mass scales ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 , 1997 ; hereinafter nfw ) . these authors suggested a simple formula to describe the spherically averaged profile of dark matter haloes @xmath3",

    "despite this consensus , there have been conflicting claims about the slope of the inner halo profile , @xmath5 .",
    "for example , diemand et al . ( 2004 , 2005 ) claims a central slope of @xmath6 , whereas other authors argued in favour of steeper , @xmath7 , cusps ( moore et al .",

    "this result may suggest that the slope of the inner halo profile may not strictly be `` universal '' ( see also gao et al .",
    "2008 ) , which might potentially explain the discrepancy found in the literature about the value of @xmath8 .",
    "the existence of cores or cusps in the centre of cdm haloes has important observational consequences for the discovery and interpretation of possible signals of dark matter annihilation in gamma - ray surveys ( stoehr et al .",
    "2003 ; diemand et al .",
    "2007 ; kuhlen et al . 2008 ; springel et al .",
    "2008b ) , since the strength of the signal goes with the square of the dark matter density .",
    "interestingly , the presence of cusps in dark matter haloes has been challenged by measurements of the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbs ) .",
    "observations of lsbs , which are supposed to be embedded in a dark matter - dominated potential , seem to favour constant - density cores , @xmath9 , for most observed systems ( e.g. flores & primack 1994 ; salucci & burkert 2000 ; swaters et al .",

    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) are another example of dark matter - dominated galaxies where significant constraints on @xmath8 can potentially be derived from the kinematics of their stellar constituents .",
    "two types of analysis can be found in the literature : the first solves the jeans equations to estimate the mass enclosed within the stellar radius .",
    "unfortunately , in pressure supported systems mass and orbital anisotropy are degenerate , making any deductions of the inner mass profile being cored or cuspy in general model - dependent ( koch et al .",

    "2007 , evans et al . 2009 ; walker et al . 2009 ) . a second analysis which aims at breaking the above degeneracy appeals to full multi - component distribution - function models , which fit the intrinsic and projected moments from hundreds of discrete radial velocities .",
    "investigations using this technique seem to favour the presence of cores in the dark matter haloes of dsphs ( wilkinson et al . 2002 ; gilmore et al .",
    "2007 ) .    the apparent difficulties of cdm to reproduce observations on small scales using pure - dark matter simulations has not deterred a rich body of work from postulating alternative explanations within the present paradigm .",
    "several authors have argued that baryons may play a fundamental role in sculpting the inner profiles of dark matter haloes , even in galaxies that at present are heavily dark matter - dominated .",
    "for example , mass outflows driven by supernova explosions may under plausible assumptions remove dark matter cusps ( e.g. navarro , vincent & frenk 1996 ; read & gilmore 2005 ; governato et al . 2010 ) .",
    "also , massive clusters that sink into the inner - most regions of dark matter haloes via dynamical friction will exchange momentum with central particles , ejecting them from the cusp and creating a core in the process ( goerdt et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "it is however debatable whether these processes are relevant on dsph scales , given that only a couple of mw dwarfs ( sagittarius and fornax ) hold a bound cluster population , and that the large majority of dwarfs with suitable kinematics show mass - to - light ratios @xmath10 .",
    "clues to these questions may be gathered from examining the overall properties of the satellite galaxy _ population _ , rather than from individual systems .",

    "pericentric passages are easily recognizable as the times when sudden drops in bound mass occur . between pericentric passages",
    "the bound mass fraction remains nearly constant , suggesting , as indicated above , that tidal forces act in an impulsive regime and have little influence on the main body of the satellite at times other than pericentre .    as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : rtrp ] , in the absence of a disc component in the host galaxy ( left panel ) the difference in mass loss that results from varying the slope of the inner density profile of our satellite models is in general small , and mostly arises at the latest stages of the orbital evolution .",
    "an exception can be gleaned from the most - eccentric modes plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ( @xmath100 ) , which show that after the first pericentric interaction the bound mass fraction of satellites with prominent cusps ( _ filled circles _ ) is a factor 23 lower than that of the cored models ( _ open squares _ ) .",
    "however , this situation reverses as the number of pericentric passages increases , which means that , when cored haloes begin to disrupt , they do so more rapidly than cuspy haloes .    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] shows that the presence of a disc component in the host introduces remarkable differences between the mass evolution of cored and cuspy satellites . whereas the rate at which satellites with prominent cusps , @xmath7 , lose mass",

    "indeed , dark matter haloes with @xmath101 show an extreme resilience to tides in all models explored here . as fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] shows , the first pericentric passage results in a significant decrease of the bound mass fraction .",
    "however , the mass loss rate progressively slows down as the number of consecutive pericentric passages increases , and the bound mass tends to converge to a finite value .",
    "this result implies that _ dwarf galaxies embedded in haloes with strong cusps , @xmath101 , can not be fully disrupted by the tidal field of the host galaxy _ , as expected from the analytical arguments given in ",
    "[ sec : tidstr ] , that would result in the total disruption of the remnant due to the positive binding energy of the nfw in that region .",
    "however , in [ sec : dens_evol ] we show that tidal stripping does _ not _ truncate the density profile of dark matter haloes ( see also pearrubia et al . 2008b , 2009 ) ] .",
    "this has interesting consequences for the properties of the satellite galaxy population , an issue to which we return below .",
    "the tidal mass stripping of dark matter haloes proceeds gradually from the outside in ( e.g. stoehr et al .",
    "2002 ; kazantzidis et al . 2004 ; kampakoglou & benson 2007 ; pearrubia et al .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyz ] , where we plot , at consecutive apocentres of the orbit , the position of the satellite particles in the satellite frame .",
    "this clearly shows how a halo is gradually stripped from the outside in , following an `` onion - peel '' process in which mass loss affects predominantly the outer , low - density regions of the satellite galaxy .    by colour - coding the particles according to the value of the projected surface density at their location we can appreciate fundamental differences in the evolution of dark matter haloes depending on whether they are cuspy ( left panel ) or cored ( right panel ) , even if both satellite models have lost the same fraction of their original mass , 97% , after three pericentric passages .",
    "the first interesting difference is that the spatial sizes of the cuspy satellite models suffer a dramatic decrease as a result of mass loss . yet",
    "the bound remnants show densities that have been barely altered by the action of tides .",
    "the response of cored satellite models to tidal mass loss is practically the opposite . in these systems",
    "the change in size if much less pronounced , and the density drops more strongly than in the cuspy models at all radii , an issue that we explore in more detail in the following section .",
    "[ fig : rhoevol ] shows the evolution of the density profile of cored ( @xmath66 , _ open circles _ ) and cuspy ( @xmath67 , _ filled circles _ ) satellite models for the most extreme orbit ( @xmath100 ) probed in our series .",
    "the systems are shown at three consecutive orbital apocentres , when the satellites have had some time to find dynamical equilibrium after being perturbed by the host tidal field at pericentre .",
    "the dotted / dashed lines are the same in each panel and show the initial density profiles for ease of reference .",
    "a few interesting points can be gleaned from this figure .",
    "one is that it is possible to identify two distinct regions on the basis of the shape of the density profile : an inner region where the profile varies smoothly with radius , and an outer region where an `` excess '' of material is present with respect to a naive extrapolation of the inner profile .",
    "several authors ( e.g oh , lin & aarseth 1995 ; mayer et al .",
    "2002 ; johnston et al . 2002 ) have shown that this type of `` breaks '' in the density profile are transient features that arise from the presence of unbound particles in the outskirts of the system as they escape from the satellite .",
    "more recently , pearrubia et al . (",
    "2009 ) have shown that the position of the `` break '' , @xmath102 , marks the radius at which the local crossing time exceeds the time elapsed since pericentre , @xmath103 , so that @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the mean velocity dispersion of the satellite .",
    "particles inside the break radius are thus within the region where enough time has elapsed for equilibrium to be reached .",
    "a second interesting point of note is that the evolution of the density profile is remarkably sensitive to the shape of the inner profile .",
    "tides acting on cuspy haloes tend to induce strong drops of density in the outer regions , as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : xyz ] , whilst keeping the shape of the inner profile barely altered , even after the satellite has been stripped of 97% of its initial mass .",
    "the bottom - right panel shows that , for a similar mass loss , tides tend to lower the central density of cored haloes more severely than in the case of haloes with a centrally - concentrated profile .",
    "the evolution of the satellite s circular velocity curve has a different amplitude depending on the slope of the inner halo profile .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoevol ] , in which we mark the position where the circular velocity reaches its peak,@xmath106 , at consecutive orbital apocentres .",

    "( 2008b ) , the evolution of the structural parameters of nfw haloes as they are tidally stripped does solely depend on the _ total amount of mass lost _ , and not on the details of _ how _ the mass is stripped .",

    "different symbols correspond to different orbits and are shown at consecutive orbital apocentres when the main body of the satellite galaxy is close to dynamical equilibrium .",
    "open and filled symbols denote models in which a disc component has been embedded in the parent galaxy .",
    "this figure illustrates a few interesting differences in the evolution of satellite galaxies depending on how distended the halo profile is in the inner - most regions .",
    "the first is that , at a given mass loss fraction , the peak velocity declines more significantly as we decrease the value of @xmath8 .",

    "this is in marked contrast with cuspy haloes , which may shrink into oblivion if tidal stripping carries on indefinitely .",
    "irrespective of pericentre , number of completed orbits , host potential , or slope of the inner density profile , the evolution of the structural parameters depends solely on how much the satellite mass has varied .",

    "thus , a natural result of the inside - out growth of galaxies is a strong correlation between the accretion time of satellites and their location within the host .",

    "this result suggests that the properties of the surviving satellite galaxy population at @xmath24 will show some scatter between different merger trees , and that that scatter will be more evident for satellites that were accreted at early , @xmath135 , epochs .",

    "this redshift roughly corresponds to the epoch at which the universe was completely re - ionized ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2002 ) , and thus we refer to these galaxies as _ re - ionization fossils_. it is typically believed that such systems went through a short phase of star formation before they crossed the virial radius of the parent galaxy and lost their primordial gaseous component through ram pressure stripping , a process captured by the n - body simulations of mayer et al .",

    "[ fig : radmass ] shows that the disc component strongly depletes the inner regions of the host galaxy from satellites . due to their small apocentres ,",
    "re - ionization fossils count among the satellites most prone to undergo full tidal disruption in @xmath66 models . as a result ,",
    "the number of surviving re - ionization fossils is close to negligible if the inner profile of dark matter haloes is cored .",
    "although cuspy satellite models also shed large fractions of their mass to tides , a bound remnant always survives the shredding process ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) . in these models",
    "the main effect of the disc component is to lower the present mass ( and luminosity ) of these systems .",
    "a second point of interest is that the satellite galaxies that have have been acted on by tides extend all the way out to the host virial radius .",
    "this is because in cdm most satellites move on highly eccentric orbits ( e.g. benson 2005 ) .",
    "thus , a significant number of galaxies with relatively large apocentres are likely to reach the inner - most regions of the host and experience severe stripping during a hubble time , as shown in fig .",

    "as anticipated above , the cumulative number of cuspy satellites barely depends on disc mass , again illustrating the fact that cusps can not be completely destroyed by tides .",
    "cored satellites , in contrast , can be fully disrupted by tides , which translates into a progressive decrease of the total number of satellites as more massive discs are assumed .",
    "this is particularly obvious for the satellites accreted prior to re - ionization ( i.e. @xmath140 ) . adopting a fiducial disc mass @xmath65 and a cored halo profile , we expect of the order 23 fossils of re - ionization in a mw - like galaxy",
    "this number nearly quadruples in halo models with @xmath67 and is barely dependent on disc mass .",
    "a result that may have important observational consequences for the detection of dark matter annihilation signals in gamma - ray surveys refers to the large abundance of satellite galaxies at small galactocentric radii .",
    "cuspy models predict the presence of the order of @xmath141 satellites within 10 kpc from the host centre with masses that range between @xmath142@xmath143 , a number that barely depends on the disc mass .",

    "our models show that the satellite mass is expected to drop at distances @xmath145 kpc if haloes have a cuspy profile .",
    "this is in a marked contrast with cored models , where the effect is the opposite . here",
    "the negative mass gradient arises simply from the depletion of satellites with small orbital apocentres .",
    "satellites that at @xmath24 are located at distances comparable to the disc size happen to be observed by chance near pericentre .",

    "however , this requires theoretical models to be able to predict properties of the _ stellar populations _ hosted by dark matter subhaloes and to make comparisons that involve observable quantities , such as galaxy luminosities and surface brightnesses . in practice , this is difficult because , in spite of strong theoretical efforts ( e.g. macci et al .",

    "although not shown here , we have also explicitely confirmed that this mismatch do not arise from biases between the satellite masses and their galactocentric distance or their time of accretion .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the deviations around the mean are relatively small taking into accout the large range of bound masses encompassed by our satellite models , and provide a good representation of the scatter shown by the observational data in models where the disc component represents a small mass fraction of the host halo .",
    "this result naturally accounts for the appearance of a `` universal mass profile '' for dwarf galaxies ( walker et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the second interesting point concerns the impact of the disc component on the masses of satellite galaxies .",

    "satellite galaxies may lose a fraction of their original mass to tides if their orbits bring them into the inner regions of the parent galaxy . a simple way to estimate",
    "the bound mass fraction of a satellite galaxy is to define the tidal radius as the distance from the satellite centre at which the force due to the satellite s self - gravity and that from the external tidal force balance . for satellites moving on circular orbits , one can estimate that radius as ( king 1962 ) @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the angular frequency of the orbit and @xmath204 is the potential of the host halo . in calculating @xmath205",

    "this means that @xmath8 as well as @xmath13 can be assumed to stay nearly constant throughout the dynamical evolution of our subhalo models .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the structural parameters of a subhalo as it is stripped can be accurately described by _ tidal tracks _",
    ", i.e. mono - parametric functions that only depend on the fraction of mass lost to tides ( see fig .  [ fig : vmrm ] ) .",
    "we can use the above information to describe the changes induced by tidal mass stripping on the density profiles of individual dark matter subhaloes as a function of their bound mass fraction .",
    "this is done in a fairly simple way : ( i ) for @xmath212 the indices of eq .  [ [ eq : rho ] ] are modified as @xmath213 .",

    "[ fig : rhoevol ] , whereas dotted lines show the profiles derived from the above recipes .",
    "except for the excess of mass visible at large radii in some cored models , which corresponds to unbound material on its way to escape from the subhalo , our semi - analytic algorithm successfully matches the evolved density profiles , even those of subhaloes that have lost a large fraction of their initial mass .",
    "this code will permit us to explore in a very efficient way aspects of galaxy formation that would otherwise require an extensive use of supercomputers , such as accounting for cosmic variance to make theoretical predictions , or the effects that varying the host galaxy disc - to - halo mass ratio would induce on the surviving satellite galaxy population .",
