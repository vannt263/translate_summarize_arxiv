    "a major obstable on the way towards a working quantum computer is decoherence : the interaction of the qubits with their environment reduces the indispensable quantum coherence of the quantum states .",
    "several strategies are pursued to beat decoherence .",
    "an active strategy is quantum error correction , which requires a redundant encoding of a logical qubit by several physical qubits  @xcite .",
    "standard error correction protocols presuppose that all physical qubits couple individually to uncorrelated baths .",
    "a passive strategy is the use of decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs )  @xcite .",
    "there , one logical qubit is encoded by several physical qubits in such a way that the logical qubit states do not couple to the environment .",
    "ideal dfss occur when physical qubits couple via a collective coordinate to a common bath .    for solid - state qubits ,",
    "the coupling to substrate phonons often is a relevant source of decoherence , in particular for charge qubits in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "whether these qubits experience correlated or uncorrelated noise depends on their distance in relation to the coherence length of the phonons , the sound velocity , the cutoff frequency and also on the dimensionality of the substrate . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this dependence has been worked out by studying pure dephasing of a two - qubit state with an initial entanglement that is decoherence - free if both qubits couple to the environment at the same position @xcite .",
    "if the qubits are spatially separated , however , this behavior changes : the entanglement decays until the transit time of a sound wave from one qubit to the other is reached .",
    "however , if the qubits are embedded in a quasi - one - dimensional environment , the noise at the two positions eventually becomes sufficiently correlated to bring decoherence to a standstill . in this way",
    ", a decoherence - poor subspace can emerge .",
    "similar results can be found for the decoherence of entangled states of a regularly spaced qubit array @xcite .",
    "this work is motivated by two questions : first , do imperfections in the regular alignment of the qubits involve additional decoherence , or , put differently , how do irregularities in the spatial extension of a qubit register influence the collective decoherence properties ? and second , is the entanglement of a qubit pair affected by its indirect interaction with a third qubit via the environment ?",
    "sketch of three qubits ( green boxes ) in a linear arrangement at positions @xmath0 , @xmath1 , with the distances @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "they interact via a coupling to the bosonic field ( red line ) . ]        as sketched in fig .",
    "[ figcouplingtostring ] , we consider a linear arrangement of three qubits at positions @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , i.e.  the nearest - neighbor separations @xmath7 and @xmath8 . to elaborate on the impact of spatially correlated noise we assume the qubit array to be embedded in a channel - like structure , as may be realized in carbon nanotubes or in linear ion traps .",
    "thus , we treat the bosonic environment as effectively one - dimensional .",
    "the total hamiltonian modelling this situation reads @xmath9 , where @xmath10 describes three qubits with energy splittings @xmath11 with @xmath12 being a pauli matrix for qubit @xmath1 .",
    "note that there is no direct interaction between the qubits . the bosonic field described by @xmath13 consists of modes @xmath14 with energies @xmath15 and the respective annihilation and creation operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we assume a linear dispersion relation @xmath18 with sound velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the transit time of a field distortion between the qubits @xmath20 and @xmath21 is then @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "qubit @xmath20 couples linearly via the operator @xmath24 to the field , so that the coupling hamiltonian reads @xmath25 with @xmath26 the bosonic field operator at the respective qubit position @xmath0 .",
    "we assume the microscopic coupling constants @xmath27 to be real - valued , isotropic , and identical for all qubits , i.e.  @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "they determine the spectral properties of the bath and show up in the spectral density @xmath30 . here",
    "we consider an ohmic spectral density @xcite @xmath31 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath32 denotes the overall coupling strength and @xmath33 the cutoff frequency of the bath spectrum .",

    "we assume that at time @xmath39 , the qubits can be prepared in a well - defined initial state , uncorrelated with the thermal bath .",
    "this constitutes an initial condition of the feynman - vernon type , where the total initial density matrix @xmath40 is a direct product of a qubit and bath density operator , @xmath41 the canonical ensemble of the bosons at temperature @xmath42 is denoted by @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the partition function .",
    "we are interested in the reduced density matrix of the qubits @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the trace over the bath variables .",
    "in order to exemplify the impact of a spatial qubit separation on decoherence , we consider as the initial state the three - qubit entangled @xmath47 state @xmath48 i.e.  @xmath49 , with the computational basis @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "our motivation to focus on the initial state is twofold : first , @xmath47 states play an important role in several protocols for quantum information processing @xcite , so that the entanglement dynamics after their preparation is relevant in itself .",
    "second , the @xmath47 state is special since it stays robust under collective dephasing , i.e.  for vanishing qubit separations ( @xmath53 ) @xcite .",
    "pure phase noise will also be assumed in the following , in which case the coupling operators in eq .",
    "become @xmath54 . as a consequence ,",
    "the interaction - picture qubit operators remain time - independent , @xmath55 .",
    "the exact time evolution of the reduced density operator can then be obtained , e.g.  by a direct solution of the liouville - von neumann equation @xcite .",
    "amazingly , the exact result can even be obtained with an _ approximative _ time - local master equation approach already in second order of the qubit - field coupling @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the density matrix elements in the basis @xmath50 at time @xmath56 are proportional to their initial values .",
    "thus , all density matrix elements that are initially zero remain zero , so that for the state @xmath57 , the dissipative quantum dynamics is restricted to the states @xmath58 density matrix elements are nonvanishing",
    ". initially they are all equal , i.e.  @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    "they evolve as @xmath61\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where the real part @xmath62 of the exponent accounts for the time - dependent amplitude damping of the matrix element ; indirect interactions among qubits via the environment give rise to a time - dependent frequency shift and the concomitant phase @xmath63 with @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath65 is a static frequency renormalization @xmath66 for qubit @xmath67 and @xmath68 describes its onset ; cf .  ref .",
    "henceforth we work in the interaction picture with respect to the renormalized energies . with the scaled temperature @xmath69 and",

    "this implies that neither the qubits nor the total system will reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless decoherence does occur since relative phases between eigenstates will be randomized so that off - diagonal density matrix elements decay .",

    "@xmath88 , when the field has also enabled communication between the two outer qubits @xmath89 and @xmath90 , decoherence even comes to a standstill ! note that other initial states may lead to complete dephasing @xcite .",
    "the fidelity saturates to a finite value @xmath91 which is larger the lower the temperature . for a fixed temperature , the stable fidelity increases",
    "if the middle qubit is displaced away from the central position and is maximal for @xmath92 , i.e.  if qubit @xmath93 becomes co - located with qubit 1 or 3 .",
    "the fidelity gain as a function of the asymmetry @xmath94 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsaturatedfidelityvardist ] .",
    "the explanation of this behavior of @xmath77 follows from eq .  .",
    "the individual coherences @xmath95 decay approximately exponentially and with the same decay rate  @xcite , but stop decaying at different times @xmath96 . hence for the fidelity it pays off to displace the middle qubit , thereby stopping the decay of @xmath97 at an earlier time @xmath98 at the expense of stopping the decay of @xmath99 only at time @xmath100 .    for the extreme cases @xmath101 and @xmath102 ,",
    "the fidelity decreases monotonously with temperature , but for @xmath103 an optimal temperature exists for which the fidelity gain is maximal .",
    "this behavior is related to the fact that for all temperatures @xmath104 when @xmath101 , and @xmath105 when @xmath102 . only in the general asymmetric configuration",
    "do all three coherences stop decaying at different times .",
    "the initial @xmath47 state is special in the sense that it exhibits bipartite entanglement between any qubit pair . but",
    "does the middle qubit affect the entanglement decay of the outer ones in any way ?",
    "the reduced density matrix of qubits @xmath89 and @xmath90 is @xmath106 it depends on time only through the coherence @xmath107 and thus , according to eq .  , only on the transit time @xmath108 between the outer qubits .",
    "the entanglement of the outer qubits is therefore _",
    "independent _ of the displacement @xmath78 of the middle qubit !",

    "surprisingly , the only effect of the presence of the middle qubit is a rescaling of the concurrence of the outer two by a factor @xmath110 .",
    "we have studied the pure dephasing of three spatially separated qubits in an ohmic environment .",
    "dephasing can be incomplete when starting in a @xmath47 state , not only for symmetrically spaced qubits . for fixed separation of the outer two qubits , the final fidelity is even larger the more `` clustered '' the qubits are .",
