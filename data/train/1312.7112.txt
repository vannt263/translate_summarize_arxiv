    "[ intro ]    two interacting ultra - relativistic flows of matter in general relativity can be successfully described by two interacting thin null shells . at the quantitative level , for spherically - symmetric spacetimes",
    ", this interaction is described by the so - called dray - thooft - redmount ( dtr ) relation @xcite .",
    "this expression relates geometries before and after interaction .    on the other hand , there are situations where one or both shells should be considered as time - like ones .",
    "this requires an extension of the dtr relation .",
    "such an extension for mixed systems of thin time - like and null shells was considered in @xcite . in this case however , the parameter space is enlarged and complications arise .",
    "the new relation will include shells velocities and additional geometrical parameters .",
    "therefore , to see the physics behind the extended dtr , we should consider examples .",
    "one particular example , where the original dtr relation was successfully exploited is the mass inflation phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the mass inflation is a violent increase of the mass parameter near the future cauchy horizon of a charged black hole .",
    "initially , such a model was constructed by israel and poisson in @xcite .",
    "the key component of the model is an ingoing null shell propagating infinitesimally close to the future cauchy horizon .",
    "another null shell crosses the horizon and triggers the mass inflation .",
    "the ingoing shell s energy blows up for the observers crossing the shell .",
    "thus such a shell can represent blue - shifted radiation near the horizon",
    ". then the mass parameter tends to infinity in the region between the shells after their interaction . in this way ,",
    "an effect similar to the mass inflation is obtained .",
    "one can consider a generalisation of the israel - poisson model where the null shell crossing the cauchy horizon is replaced by a collapsing time - like shell . in this case , time - like shell represents an ensemble of infalling observers .",
    "then using the extended dtr , it is possible to explore the question about the fate of observers crossing the future cauchy horizon of the charged black hole when backreaction is taken into account .",
    "we point out that similar problem was considered in @xcite using perturbative analysis near the future cauchy horizon .",
    "the authors of @xcite conclude that observers can experience finite tidal effects near the cauchy horizon .    in our model ,",
    "observers `` burn down '' on the cauchy horizon - the time - like shell effectively turns into a null shell after crossing with the null shell propagated along the cauchy horizon .",
    "moreover , the mass inflation phenomenon is still present in the model .",
    "another extension considered in the paper takes the original israel - poisson model as its essential part . in this case",
    "the timelike shell enters the region behind the cauchy horizon where the mass inflation already takes place",
    ". we will be interested in the geometry of the region between timelike an ingoing null shells .",
    "it appears that apart from the mass inflation scenario in this region there is a choice of parameters which leads to the rn geometry with finite mass .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec:0 ] contains some previously known technical results . in particular , definitions of @xmath0- ,",
    "@xmath1-regions are presented , since they are extensively used throughout the paper .",
    "next , the theory of thin shells is elucidated . finally in the section",
    ", the extended dray - thooft - redmount relation is obtained . in section [ sec:1 ] two extensions of the israel - poisson model",
    "are constructed and studied .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] contains summary and conclusions .",
    "any spherically symmetric spacetime @xmath2 can be considered as a collection of the so - called @xmath1- and @xmath0-regions separated by apparent horizons .",
    "since notions of the @xmath1- and @xmath0-regions will be extensively used throughout the paper , let us recall their definitions ( * ? ? ?",
    "spherically symmetric space - time metric can be written in the form @xmath3 and can be locally described by only two functions @xcite .",
    "the first one is the radius @xmath4 which is defined in such a way that the area of the sphere equals @xmath5 .",
    "the second one is the square of the vector normal to the surfaces of constant radius @xmath6 .",
    "we say that a given point @xmath7 belongs to a @xmath0-region if the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 world line is timelike ( @xmath11 ) in the neighbourhood of that point .",
    "if this world line is spacelike ( @xmath12 ) , we say that the given point belongs to a @xmath1-region .",
    "let us fix the remained gauge freedom in by a transformation to coordinates @xmath13 where @xmath14 has diagonal form .",
    "then it is evident that in the @xmath0-region we can not have @xmath15 .",
    "so the sign of partial derivative of the radius is an invariant .",
    "thus , we have either @xmath16 which is called the @xmath17-region , or @xmath18 , called the @xmath19-region .    similarly , for a @xmath1-region we can never have @xmath20 .",
    "thus , there may be regions of inevitable expansion with @xmath21 , and regions of inevitable contraction with @xmath22 .",
    "the former are called @xmath23-regions , while the latter - @xmath24-regions .    the null surfaces @xmath25 of constant radius with @xmath26 define either an apparent horizon ( a marginally trapped surface ) or a anti - trapped surface .",
    "@xmath25 serve as boundaries between @xmath0- and @xmath1-regions .    in many cases",
    ", however , @xmath0- and @xmath1-regions can be recognised more easily when is written in double null coordinates @xcite @xmath27 metric is future oriented in the standard way so that @xmath28 are both increasing towards the future .",

    "the general mathematical theory of thin shells was introduced in @xcite .",
    "thin shells are @xmath49-singular objects , since a non - zero amount of energy is confined in vanishing volume . in other words , while the metric coefficients are continuous across a shell s hypersurface , their derivatives undergo a jump .",
    "this jump is governed by the so - called israel equations . in the case of time - like hypersurface",
    "the israel equations connect the surface energy - momentum tensor @xmath50 of the shell to the jump in the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath51 describing embedding of the shell s hypersurface into the geometry on the corresponding side of the shell .",

    "then the ( electro)vacuum spacetime with the null shell is a special case of the vaidya metric where the mass function is proportional to a step function .",

    "the mass function is @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the total mass of the shell .",

    "let us make some cautionary remarks",
    ". in the above construction , an initial value problem for a system of several crossing shell is not well defined @xcite .",
    "this happens since we do not define physics near the interaction point .",
    "the extended dtr can not solve the problem .",
    "then , for example , the above procedure is equally well defined whether or not the number of shells is conserved during the interaction . even more , equations of state for shells can be changed during the interaction . in the next section , to avoid these ambiguities , we will assume that the shells interaction is purely gravitational .",
    "now , having all necessary tools at our disposal , we can study how crossing shells may be applied to modelling of matter interactions near cauchy horizons of charged black holes .",
    "we start with the well - known israel - poisson model and then try to extend it .",
    "two crossing null shells were used by israel and poisson as the simplest model to explain the mass inflation phenomenon @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the mass inflation is a violent increase of the mass parameter near the future cauchy horizon of charged and rotating black holes . the interior model of rn black hole in @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "14.4.3 ) ) contains two cross - flowing streams of radially moving null dust .",
    "the ingoing flow models the infalling backscattered radiation which was initially emitted from the surface of a collapsing body .",
    "the outgoing flow represents the outgoing part of backscattered radiation . in the simplest case ,",
    "these streams can be described by two crossing uncharged light - like shells .",
