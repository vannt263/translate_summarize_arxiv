    "determining the chemical composition of galaxies is of fundamental importance for tracing back the history of evolution of galaxies .",
    "in particular , the lmr has been widely studied in the local universe .",
    "metallicities are tightly related with the luminosities of galaxies in such a way , that brighter systems have higher abundances ( lamareille et al .",
    "furthermore , recent studies have also suggested that this relation extends to intermediate redshifts but displaced towards lower metallicities and higher luminosities ( kobulnicky et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "when studying galaxy evolution , stellar mass is a better parameter than luminosity .",
    "however , because of the difficulties in obtaining stellar masses , most studies have used luminosity as a surrogate .",
    "recently , though , tremonti et al . (",
    "2004 ) have estimated the relation between metallicity and stellar mass in the local universe .",
    "the authors found a strong correlation extended over 2 dex in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity .    in this work ,",
    "we study the evolution of the mmr and the lmr by employing numerical chemo - dynamical simulations which allow to describe the non - lineal growth of structure simultaneously with the enrichment of the interstellar medium in a cosmological framework .",
    "we have run numerical simulations by using the chemical gadget-2 of scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . a @xmath0cdm cosmological model ( @xmath4=0.3 , @xmath0=0.7 , @xmath5=0.04 and @xmath6=100 @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 with @xmath7=0.7 ) was assumed , according to which galaxies formed by the hierarchical aggregation of substructures .",
    "we have analysed two realizations of the power spectrum in a 10 mpc @xmath9 side box , initially resolved with @xmath10 ( s160 ) and @xmath11 ( s80 ) particles , corresponding to mass resolutions of @xmath12 m@xmath13 and @xmath14 m@xmath13 for the gas phase and @xmath15 m@xmath13 and @xmath16 m@xmath13 for dark matter respectively .",
    "a salpeter initial mass function has been assumed with upper and lower limits of 40 m@xmath17 and 0.1 m@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the chemical model includes metal - dependent radiative cooling , star formation and chemical enrichment by supernovae ii and ia ( scannapieco et al . 2005 ) .",
    "galactic objects were identified by applying an identification algorithm that combines the friends - of - friends technique and the contrast density criterium of white , efstathiou & frenk ( 1993 ) .",
    "dynamical and chemical properties were estimated at the optical radius calculated accordingly to the standard definition as the radius which contains the 83% of the baryonic mass of the system ( tissera et al .",
    "colours and magnitudes of galactic systems were calculated by resorting to population synthesis models ( see de rossi et al .",
    "2006 in preparation ) .",
    "our simulations predict a linear correlation between oxygen abundance and luminosity which is in good agreement with the observational results .",
    "we have also found an evolution in the lmr in such a way that the slope increases and the zero point decreases with redshift consistently with the findings of kobulnicky & kewley ( 2004 ) , among others .",
    "in particular , we decided to work with the i - band because it is less affected by extinction and can be more directly related with the underlying mass distributions .",
    "our results indicate that at a given chemical abundance , galactic systems are @xmath18 3 dex brighter at @xmath19 compared to @xmath20 , with the larger evolution at fainter magnitudes .",
    "futhermore , we have encountered a mean evolution in the chemical abundances of galactic systems of @xmath18 1.6 dex for brighter magnitudes and @xmath18 2.5 dex for faint ones , from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "we have also analysed the mmr for simulated galactic systems , obtaining similar trends to those found by tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) but with a displacement of -0.25 dex in the zero point .",
    "this last difference may be explained taking into account that the sdss explored only the central regions of galaxies which could lead to an overestimation of their metal content .",
    "galactic abundances derived from simulations tend to increase with stellar mass which is also consistent with the observed behaviour .",
    "however , we obtained an excess of metals in the lower mass end which could be due to the absence of supernovae energy feedback in our model .",
    "we have determined a characteristic stellar mass at @xmath21 m@xmath13 where a change in the curvature of the mmr occurs .",
    "this characteristic mass , which corresponds to an oxygen abundance of @xmath18 8.7 dex , has been obtained by estimating where the residuals of the linear fits depart systematically from zero .",
    "it is important to note that this mass is similar to the characteristic mass derived from the sdss by tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and gallazzi et al.(2005 ) .",
    "in addition , we have found that the mmr exhibits the same general patterns from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , but with a displacement towards higher abundances as redshift decreases .",
    "the characteristic stellar mass @xmath22 remains almost unchanged with time and only its corresponding chemical abundance evolves by 0.05 dex in the same redshift range .",
    "the major departure from the local mmr occurs for smaller systems which increase their chemical content by @xmath18 0.10 dex . on the other hand ,",
    "massive systems show less evolution with variations of @xmath18 0.05 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .    we have also studied the metallicity - optical velocity relation ( mvr ) finding a well defined correlation from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "however , a higher level of evolution has been found in the mvr when compared to the mmr .",
    "fast rotators show an enrichment of @xmath18 0.18 dex from @xmath19 to @xmath20 while at lower metallicities the variations are of @xmath18 0.28 dex .",
    "this significant evolution of the mvr is a consequence of the increase of the mean density of the universe at high redshift , so that at a fix stellar mass , systems need to concentrate more in order to fullfill the contrast density criterium and , hence , galaxies reach higher velocities .",
    "the larger evolution showed by the simulated mvr , when compared with the mmr , shows that the second is more fundamental in the sense that it is not strongly dependent on the cosmic epoch ( see tissera , de rossi & scannapieco 2005 for details ) .    by analysing the merger trees of systems at @xmath20 , we have encountered that the features of the mmr can be traced back in time taking into account the mergers and interaction history of galaxies within the hierarchical aggregation picture .",
    "more massive systems transform most of their gas into stars at high redshifts and experience important mergers . at lower redshifts",
    ", these galactic objects are saturated of stars , so that , while their stellar mass largely increases in a merger event , their metallicity remains basically unchanged .",
    "on the other hand , less massive systems form their stars in a more passive way or by rich - gas mergers leading to a more tight correlation between metallicity and stellar mass .",
    "we have estimated the mmr , the lmr and the mvr correlations finding similars trends to those detected in observations .",
    "these relations evolve with redshift with the major changes driven by less massive systems in consistency with the downsizing scenario .",
