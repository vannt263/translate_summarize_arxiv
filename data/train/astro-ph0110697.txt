    "important advances have been made in recent years on the modeling of the first stars and galaxies forming out of pristine matter  so called population iii ( pop iii ) objects  in the early universe ( see e.g.  the proceedings of weiss  2000 and umemura & susa 2001 ) . among the questions addressed ( see also the reviews of loeb & barkana 2001 and barkana & loeb 2001 ) are the star formation process and the initial mass function ( imf ) of the first stars ( tegmark  1997 , abel  1998 , 2000 , bromm  1999 , nakamura & umemura 1999 , 2001 , omukai & palla 2001 ) , their effect of energy injection and supernovae ( sn ) ( maclow & ferrara 1999 , ciardi  2000 ) , their role on cosmic reionisation ( haiman & loeb 1997 , gnedin & ostriker 1997 , tumlinson & shull 2000 , cojazzi  2000 , ciardi  2001 ) , metal enrichment of the igm and other signatures of early chemical evolution ( ferrara  2000 , abia  2001 ) , and dust formation ( todini & ferrara 2000 ) .",
    "extensive sets of recent stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations for zero metallicity stars covering a wide range of stellar masses have also become available recently ( marigo  2000 , feijo 1999 , desjacques 2000 , woosley & weaver 1995 , heger  2000 , 2001 , umeda  2000 ) .",
    "tumlinson & shull ( 2000 , hereafter ts00 ) have recently pointed out the exceptionally strong he@xmath0 ionising flux of massive ( @xmath8 40 ) pop iii stars , which must be a natural consequence of their compactness , i.e.  high effective temperatures , and non - lte effects in their atmospheres increasing the flux in the ionising continua . as a consequence strong he  ii  recombination lines such as he  ii @xmath41640  or he  ii @xmath44686  are expected ; together with agn a rather unique feature of metal - free stellar populations , as discussed by ts00 and tumlinson  ( 2001 , hereafter tgs01 ) . instead of assuming a `` standard '' population i like salpeter imf and `` normal '' stellar masses up to 100  as ts00 , bromm  ( 2001 ) have considered stars with masses larger than 300 , which may form according to some recent hydrodynamical models ( abel  1998 , bromm  1999 , nakamura & umemura 2001 )",
    ". an even stronger ionising flux and stronger h and he  ii  emission lines was found .    some strong simplifying assumptions are , however , made in the calculations of ts00 , tgs01 , and bromm  ( 2001 ) .",
    "* all stars are assumed to be on the zero age main sequence , i.e.  stellar evolution proceeding generally to cooler temperatures is neglected .",
    "* bromm  ( 2001 ) take the hardness of the stellar spectrum of the hottest ( 1000 ) star as representative for all stars with masses down to 300 .",
    "this leads in particular to an overestimate of the he  ii recombination line luminosities .",
    "* none of the studies include nebular continuous emission , which can not be neglected for metal - poor objects with such strong ionising fluxes .",
    "this process increases significantly the total continuum flux at wavelengths redward of lyman-@xmath3 and leads in turn to reduced emission line equivalent widths . *",
    "a single , fixed , imf is considered only by ts00 and tgs01 . in view of the uncertainties on this quantity",
    "it appears useful to explore a wider range of imfs .",
    "the models presented here relax all the above assumptions and allow the exploration of a wide parameter space in terms of stellar tracks ( including also alternate tracks with strong mass loss ) , imf , and star formation history ( instantaneous bursts or constant star formation rate ( sfr ) ) .",
    "for this aim we provide in particular the main results in tabulated form and as fit formulae .",
    "first we examine the influence of several poorly constrained physical processes ( mass loss , non coherent electron scattering etc . ) on the predicted stellar fluxes of pop iii stars using non - lte atmosphere models .",
    "combined with metal - free stellar tracks these predictions are then introduced to our evolutionary synthesis code ( schaerer & vacca 1998 ) updated to calculate the nebular properties ( h and he emission lines and nebular continuum ) for metal - free gas . in this manner",
    "we examine the properties of both individual pop iii stars and integrated stellar populations .",
    "calculations of the relative photon to metal production of stellar populations ( e.g.  madau & shull 1996 ) have proven useful for a variety of studies ranging from estimates of the stellar contribution to the uv background radiation ( madau & shull 1996 ) , over studies of metals in the igm , to sn rates in the early universe and their detectability ( miralda - escud & rees 1997 ) . to improve on such calculations based on solar metallicity models",
    "we also calculate the heavy element production from metal - poor and metal - free populations including contributions from type ii sn and possible pair creation sn from very massive stars ( cf .",
    "ober  1983 , heger 2000 ) .",
    "it is the hope that our models should in particular help to examine more precisely the properties of the first luminous objects in the universe in preparation of their first direct observation ( cf .",
    "tgs01 , oh  2001a , schaerer & pell 2001 , pell & schaerer 2001 ) .    the paper is structured as follows : the main model ingredients are summarised in sect .",
    "[ s_models ] . in sect .",
    "[ s_single ] we discuss the properties of individual pop iii stars .",
    "the properties of integrated stellar populations , their spectra , photon fluxes , metal production etc .  are presented in sect .",
    "[ s_pops ] .",
    "our main results are summarised in sect .",
    "[ s_summary ] .",
    "as well known ( e.g.  mihalas 1978 ) strong departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) occur in the atmospheres of hot stars . in addition , for the most massive stars it is of interest to examine the possible effect of mass loss on their emergent spectra .",
    "albeit presumably small , mass loss  due to radiation pressure or pulsational instabilities ( kudritzki 2000 , baraffe  2000 )  potentially affects the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , especially in the ionising continua , as known for pop i stars ( gabler 1989 , schaerer & de koter 1997 ) . for stars with negligible ionising fluxes ,",
    "the remainder of the sed of interest here ( rest - frame uv and optical ) is well described by plane parallel lte atmospheres .",
    "to account for these cases we use the following model atmospheres :    * for stars with  @xmath9 20000 k we constructed an extensive grid of pure h and he plane parallel model atmospheres using the non - lte code _ tlusty _ code of hubeny & lanz ( 1995 ) .",
    "as far as it is possible to construct hydrostatic structures , we calculated a model grid with various @xmath10 values ( typically @xmath11 ) to cover the domain corresponding to the evolutionary tracks ( see below ) .",
    "the primordial he abundance of izotov & thuan ( 1998 , mass fraction @xmath12 ) was adopted .",
    "the influence of the exact h / he abundance on the spectra is small . * to explore the possible importance of mass loss on the ionising spectra of massive pop iii stars , we use the _ cmfgen _ code of hillier & miller ( 1998 ) , which calculates the radiation transfer in the co - moving frame and solves for non - lte equilibrium in radiative equilibrium .",
    "the input atmospheric structure including photosphere and wind is calculated with the _ isa - wind _ code of de koter  ( 1996 ) .",
    "models were calculated for stellar parameters corresponding to the zero age main sequence ( zams ) of 25 , 60 , and 500  stars ( parameters given in sect .",
    "[ s_ave ] ) and an evolved 60  model at 52 kk , and wind parameters @xmath13 2000 km s@xmath14 and @xmath15 10@xmath16 to 10@xmath17  yr@xmath14 ( 10@xmath18 to 10@xmath19 for the 500  model ) .",
    "the same h / he abundances as above are adopted .",
    "+ for stars with strong mass loss ( as also explored below ) we have used the pure helium wolf - rayet ( wr ) atmosphere models of schmutz  ( 1992 ) .",
    "the two parameters , core temperature and wind density , required to couple these models to the stellar evolution models are calculated as in schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) . * the plane parallel lte models of kurucz ( 1991 ) with a very metal - poor composition ( [ fe / h ] @xmath20 ) are adopted for stars with  @xmath21 20000 k. the models with such a low metal content are equivalent to pure h and he lte models ( cojazzi  2000 , chavez  2001 ) .      to explore two extreme evolutionary scenarios for massive stars we have constructed two different sets of zero metallicity stellar evolution tracks : _",
    "1 ) _ no mass loss , _ 2 ) _ strong mass loss ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_hrd ] ) .    for tracks with no or negligible mass loss ( 1 ) we use recent tracks from 1 to 500  calculated with the geneva stellar evolution code ( feijo 1999 , desjacques 2000 ) .",
    "these tracks , including only the core h - burning phase and assuming small mass loss , have been compared with the tracks of marigo  ( 2001 ) up to 100  and additional models up to 500  by marigo ( 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "good agreement is found regarding the zero age main sequences ( zams ) , h - burning lifetimes , and the overall appearance of the tracks .",
    "the differences due to mass loss in the geneva models are minor for the purpose of the present work .",
    "furthermore , as the he - burning lifetime is @xmath22 10 % of the main sequence phase and is spent at cooler temperatures ( cf .",
    "marigo   2001 ) , neglecting this phase has no consequences for our predictions .",
    "this has also been verified by comparisons of integrated stellar populations adopting alternatively the isochrones provided by marigo  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the `` strong mass loss '' set ( 2 ) consists of a combination of the following stellar tracks for the mass range from 80 to 1000 .",
    "tracks of klapp ( 1983 ) for initial masses of 1000 and 500  computed with values of @xmath23 and 100 respectively for the mass loss parameter values yield a qualitatively similar behaviour as the el eid  ( 1983 ) models . ] . for 300 , 220 , 200 , 150 , 100 , and 80",
    "we adopt the tracks of el eid  ( 1983 ) .",
    "the remaining models ( 1 to 60 ) are from the `` no mass loss '' set .",
    "the main difference between the `` strong '' and `` no mass loss '' sets is the rapid _ blueward _ evolution of the stars in the former case , due to strong increase of the he abundance on the surface of these stars leading to a hot wr - like phase ( see fig .  [ fig_hrd ] ) .",
    "while the use of updated input physics ( e.g.  nuclear reaction rates ) could lead to somewhat different results if recomputed with more modern codes , the predicted tracks depend essentially only on the adopted mass loss ( see also chiosi & maeder 1986 ) , and remain thus completely valid .    in figure [ fig_hrd ]",
    "the two set of tracks are compared to the low metallicity ( @xmath24 , dotted lines ) models of lejeune & schaerer ( 2000 ) and the position of a solar metallicity zams ( schaller  1992 ) .",
    "this illustrates the well known fact that  due to the lack of cno elements  the zams of massive pop iii stars is much hotter that their solar or low metallicity counterparts ( cf .",
    "ezer & cameron 1971 , el eid  1983 , tumlison & shull 2000 ) .",
    "in particular this implies that at @xmath25 stars with @xmath8 5  have unusually high temperatures and in turn non - negligible ionising fluxes ( cf .",
    "[ s_single ] ) corresponding to normal o - type stars (  @xmath7 30 kk ) .      to calculate the properties of integrated zero metallicity stellar populations",
    "we have included the stellar atmosphere models and evolutionary tracks in the evolutionary synthesis code of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) .",
    "the following changes have been made to adapt the calculations to metal - free populations .",
    "the potentially strongest h and he recombination lines in the rest - frame uv from lyman-@xmath3  longward to h@xmath3  in the optical spectrum are calculated , namely lyman-@xmath3 , he  ii @xmath41640 , he  ii  @xmath43203 , he  i  @xmath44026 , he  i @xmath44471 , he  ii @xmath44686 , h@xmath26 , he  i  @xmath45016 , he  i  @xmath45876 , and h@xmath3 0.4 , he  i  with @xmath27 0.4 , plus h@xmath26   and h@xmath3 . ] .",
    "we assume case b recombination for an electron temperature of @xmath28 k appropriate of metal - free gas and a low electron density ( @xmath29 @xmath30 ) .",
    "the emissivities and recombination coefficients of storey & hummer ( 1995 ) are used in general . for he",
    "i @xmath44471  we take the data from osterbrock ( 1989 ) for @xmath31 k. lyman-@xmath3  emission is computed assuming a fraction of 0.68 of photons converted to lyman-@xmath3  ( spitzer 1978 ) . for these assumptions the line luminosities ( in units of erg s@xmath14 ) are thus expressed as @xmath32 = c_l \\,\\ , ( 1 - f_{\\rm esc } ) \\,\\",

    "sect.[s_pops ] ) , and @xmath36 is the ionising photon flux ( in units of s@xmath14 ) corresponding to the appropriate recombination line .",
    "the line emissivities depend only relatively weakly on the assumed conditions . adopting , e.g.  a temperature of @xmath37 k leads to an increase of the he  ii  line luminosities by @xmath2 10  30 % , whereas changes of @xmath22 10 % are found for the h lines ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",

    "the relative contribution of the he@xmath61 and the he@xmath0 regions is to first order easily calculated from the relative size of the respective stroemgren spheres and is given by @xmath62 .",
    "as expected , the resulting contribution from the he@xmath0 region is small , even in the case of the hardest spectra considered here .",
    "however , as shown later , the total nebular continuous emission is not negligible for population iii objects even in the rest - uv range .      the question of the masses and mass distribution of metal - free stars has been studied since the 1960 s ( see the volume of weiss  2000 for recent results ) .",
    "while the outcome from various hydrodynamical models and other studies still differ , there seems to be an overall consensus that stars with unusually large masses ( up to @xmath2 10@xmath63 ) may form , possibly even preferentially ( e.g.  abel  1998 , bromm   1999 , 2001 , nakamura & umemura 2001 ) .",
    "uehara  ( 1996 ) and nakamura & umemura ( 1999 , 2001 ) also find that the formation of stars with masses down to @xmath2 1  is not excluded ( cf .",
    "also abel  2001 ) .",
    "the differences may be of various origins ( adopted numerical scheme and resolution , treatment of radiation transfer and optically thick regions etc . ) .",
    "in view of our ignorance on this issue we adopt a variety of different upper and lower mass limits of the imf assumed to be a powerlaw , with the aim of assessing their impact on the properties of integrated stellar populations .",
    "the main cases modeled here are summarised below in table [ tab_models ] . except",
    "if mentioned otherwise , the imf slope is taken as the salpeter value ( @xmath64 2.35 ) between the lower and upper mass cut - off values  and  respectively .",
    "the consideration of stars even more massive than 1000  ( or no mass loss models with @xmath1 500 ) is limited by the availability of evolutionary tracks for such objects .",

    "the underlying changes of all quantities on which @xmath5 depends are listed in table [ tab_sfr ] .",
    "the increase of @xmath5 from  to 1/50 100  as for models a and zs reduces q(h ) @xmath42  by 16 % . ]",
    "indicates already a substantially larger photon to heavy element production which must have occurred in the early universe .",
    "in passing we note that our value of @xmath144 ( or 0.5 % neglecting stellar mass loss and snibc ) is larger than the value of 0.2 % given by madau & shull ( 1996 ) , which , given the quoted assumptions appears to be erroneous .",
    "this can be easily seen by noting the good agreement between our photon production calculation and other calculations in the literature ( e.g.  the h@xmath3 sfr calibration of kennicutt 1998 , glazebrook  1999 ) .",
    "in addition one can easily estimate the metal production from noting that @xmath145 , with typically @xmath146 ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) and integrating over the imf , which confirms our calculations .",
    "finally the predicted ejecta of carbon , oxygen , and silicon show some interesting variations with the imf . from the `` standard '' imf ( a ) to an imf producing exclusively very massive stars ( model c ) , the oxygen / carbon ratio ( o / c ) @xmath2 0.8 ( o / c)@xmath147 increases by a factor @xmath2 4 , while increases from si / c @xmath2 1.8 ( si / c)@xmath147 by a factor of @xmath2 10 !",
    "it is interesting to compare these values with current measurements of abundance ratios in the lyman-@xmath3 forest , which indicate an overabundance of si / c @xmath2 2  3 ( si / c)@xmath147 ( songaila & cowie , 1996 , giroux & shull 1997 ) , but possibly up to @xmath2 10 times solar , depending on the adopted ionising uv background radiation field ( savaglio  1997 , giroux & shull 1997 ) .",
    "if the ejecta from pop iii objects are responsible for the bulk of metals in the lyman-@xmath3 forest , it would appear that imfs strongly favouring massive stars seem to be excluded by studies finding a modest si / c overabundance .",
    "the use of more detailed chemical evolution models including also intermediate mass stars ( cf .",
    "abia  2001 ) and additional studies on abundances in the ly@xmath3 forest should hopefully provide stronger constraints on early nucleosynthesis and the imf of pop iii stars .",
    "the main aim of present study was to construct realistic models for massive population iii stars and stellar populations to study their spectral properties , including their dependence on age , star formation history , and most importantly on the imf , which remains very uncertain for such objects .",
    "we have calculated extensive sets of non - lte model atmospheres appropriate for metal - free stars with the _ tlusty _ code ( hubeny & lanz 1995 ) for plane parallel atmospheres .",
    "the comparison with non - lte models including stellar winds , constructed with the comoving frame code _",
    "cmfgen _ of hillier & miller ( 1998 ) , shows that even in the presence of some putative ( weak ) mass loss , the ionising spectra of pop iii stars differ negligibly from those of plane parallel models , in stark contrast with pop i stars ( gabler  1989 , schaerer & de koter 1997 ) . as already discussed by tumlinson & shull ( 2000 ) , the main salient property of pop iii stars is their increased ionising flux , especially in the he@xmath0 continuum ( @xmath1 54 ev ) .",
    "the model atmospheres have been introduced together with recent metal free stellar evolution tracks from the geneva and padova groups ( feijo 1999 , desjacques 2000 , marigo  2000 ) and older pop iii tracks assuming strong mass loss ( klapp 1983 , el eid  1983 ) in the evolutionary synthesis code of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) to study the temporal evolution of individual pop iii stars and stellar populations .      * due to their redward evolution off the zero age main sequence ( zams ) the spectral hardness measured by the he@xmath0/h ionising flux is decreased by a factor @xmath2 2 when averaged over their lifetime .",
    "if such stars would suffer strong mass loss , their spectral appearance could , however , remain similar to that of their zams position . *",
    "the ionising photon fluxes of h , he@xmath137 , he@xmath0 , and the flux in the lyman - werner band dissociating h@xmath83 have been tabulated and detailed fit formulae are given for stars from 5 to 1000 .",
    "these can in particular be used to calculate with arbitrary imfs the properties of zams populations or cases of constant sfr . for comparison the same quantities",
    "are also given for solar metallicity and 1/50 .",
    "the integrated spectral properties including line emission from h , he  i , he  ii   recombination lines ( treated e.g.  by ts00 , bromm  2001 ) and nebular continuous emission  neglected in all earlier studies  have been calculated for instantaneous bursts and constant formation rates .",
    "various assumptions on the mass cut - offs of the imf including a `` standard '' imf from 1 to 100  or imfs forming exclusively very massive stars have been considered ( see table [ tab_models ] ) .",
    "* for young bursts and the case of a constant sfr , nebular continuous emission dominates the spectrum or is at least important to properly predict it redward of lyman-@xmath3 if the escape fraction @xmath34 of ionising photons out of the observed region is small or negligible . in consequence predicted emission line equivalent widths are considerably smaller than found in earlier studies , whereas the detection of the continuum is eased .",
    "maximum equivalent widths of w(ly@xmath3 ) @xmath2 1700 and w(he  ii @xmath41640 ) @xmath2 120   are predicted for a salpeter imf with  @xmath2 500  1000 .",
    "nebular line and continuous emission strongly affect the broad band photometric properties of pop iii objects and ( see schaerer & pell 2001 , pell & schaerer 2001 ) . detailed treatment models including geometrical effects , radiation transfer etc .",
    "e.g.  ciardi  2001 ) will be useful to constrain @xmath34 more precisely .",
    "* due to the redward stellar evolution and short lifetimes of the most massive stars , the hardness of the ionising spectrum decreased rapidly , leading to the disappearance of the characteristic he  ii  recombination lines after @xmath2 3 myr in instantaneous bursts . *",
    "he  ii @xmath41640 , h@xmath3  ( and other ) line luminosities usable as indicators of the star formation rate are given for the case of a constant sfr ( table [ tab_sfr ] ) ) . for obvious reasons",
    "such indicators depend strongly on the imf . *",

    "@xmath119 100  the increased photon production and the reduced metal yields of pop iii stars lead to an increase of @xmath5 by a factor of 5 to 18 when compared to low ( 1/50 ) or solar metallicity . in the presence of very massive stars ( @xmath148 130  260 ) leading to pair creation sn , somewhat lower values of @xmath6",
    "1.6 to 2.2 % are obtained . in any case",

    "have been calculated . the o / c abundance and",
    "even more so si / c increase to highly supersolar values if very massive stars leading to pair creation sn form . how far measurements of such abundance ratios , e.g.  in the lyman-@xmath3 forest , can be used to constrain the imf of the first stellar objects ,",
    "remains currently unclear , as also discussed by abia  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the present model set should also be useful to explore the feasibility of future direct observations of pop iii `` galaxies '' and to optimise search strategies for such objects .",
    "we have started undertaking such studies ( schaerer & pell 2001 , pell & schaerer 2001 ) .",
    "tumlinson  ( 2001 ) speculate that some emission line objects found in deep lyman-@xmath3 surveys could actually be he  ii @xmath41640emitters such as the metal - free galaxies discussed here .",
    "recently oh  ( 2001a ) have estimated the number of pop iii sources and mini quasars emitting strong he  ii  lines . although still speculative , their calculations predict sufficient sources for successful detections with deep , large field observations foreseeable with the next generation space telescope or future instruments on ground - based 10 m class telescopes .",
    "pilot studies now also start to address the question of dust formation and obscuration in the early universe ( todini & ferrara 2001 ) , which remain a concern for observations . in any case",

    "<S> we present realistic models for massive population iii stars and stellar populations based on non - lte model atmospheres , recent stellar evolution tracks and up - to - date evolutionary synthesis models , with the aim to study their spectral properties , including their dependence on age , star formation history , and imf .    </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of plane parallel non - lte model atmospheres and comoving frame calculations shows that even in the presence of some putative weak mass loss , the ionising spectra of metal - free populations differ little or negligibly from those obtained using plane parallel non - lte models . as already discussed by tumlinson & shull ( 2000 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the main salient property of pop iii stars is their increased ionising flux , especially in the he@xmath0 continuum ( @xmath1 54 ev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the main result obtained for _ individual pop iii stars _ is the following : due to their redward evolution off the zero age main sequence ( zams ) the spectral hardness measured by the he@xmath0/h ionising flux is decreased by a factor @xmath2 2 when averaged over their lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> if such stars would suffer strong mass loss , their spectral appearance could , however , remain similar to that of their zams position .    </S>",
    "<S> the main results regarding _ integrated stellar populations _ are :    * for young bursts and the case of a constant sfr , nebular continuous emission  neglected in previous studies  dominates the spectrum redward of lyman-@xmath3 if the escape fraction of ionising photons out of the considered region is small or negligible . in consequence </S>",
    "<S> predicted emission line equivalent widths are considerably smaller than found in earlier studies , whereas the detection of the continuum is eased . </S>",
    "<S> nebular line and continuous emission strongly affect the broad band photometric properties of pop iii objects . </S>",
    "<S> * due to the redward stellar evolution and short lifetimes of the most massive stars , the hardness of the ionising spectrum decreases rapidly , leading to the disappearance of the characteristic he  ii  recombination lines after @xmath2 3 myr in instantaneous bursts . * </S>",
    "<S> he  ii @xmath41640 , h@xmath3  ( and other ) line luminosities usable as indicators of the star formation rate are given for the case of a constant sfr . </S>",
    "<S> for obvious reasons such indicators depend strongly on the imf . * due to an increased photon production and reduced metal yields , the relative efficiency of ionising photon energy to heavy element rest mass production , @xmath5 , of metal - poor and metal - free populations is increased by factors of @xmath2 4 to 18 with respect to solar metallicity and for `` standard '' imfs . * </S>",
    "<S> the lowest values of @xmath6 1.6  2.2 % are obtained for imfs exclusively populated with high mass stars (  @xmath7 50 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if correct , the yields dominated by pair creation snae then predict large overabundances of o / c and si / c compared to solar abundance ratios .    </S>",
    "<S> detailed results are given in tabular form and as fit formulae for easy implementation in other calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted spectra will be used to study the detectability of pop iii galaxies and to derive optimal search strategies for such objects . </S>"
