    "in this paper we expand on the results of a recent letter @xcite in which a model was proposed for slow crack propagation via void formation ahead of the crack due to plastic yields . here ` slow ' means propagation velocity considerably smaller than the rayleigh wave speed .",
    "the model was motivated by some quantitative studies of fracture surfaces , which reveal self - affine rough cracks with two scaling regimes : at small length scales ( smaller than a typical cross - over length @xmath3 ) the roughness exponent is @xmath4 , whereas at scales larger than @xmath3 the roughness exponent is @xmath1 .",
    "the second scaling regime is seen to have an upper cut - off @xmath5 known as the correlation length .",
    "such measurements were reported first for ductile materials ( like metals ) where @xmath3 is of the order of 1 @xmath0 m @xcite , and more recently for brittle materials like glass , but with a much smaller value of @xmath3 , of about 1 nm @xcite .",
    "similar experiments conducted on 2-dimensional samples reported rough cracks with large - scale exponents @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath4 is characteristic of uncorrelated random surfaces , but higher exponents indicate the existence of positive correlations @xcite ; naturally , the experimental discovery of such correlated  anomalous \" exponents attracted considerable interest with repeated attempts to derive them theoretically @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite presented a quantitative model for self - affine fracture surfaces based on elasticity theory supplemented with considerations of plastic deformations .",
    "focussing on infinite 2-dimensional materials , ref .",
    "@xcite followed the qualitative picture presented recently in @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ yield ] . in this picture",
    "there exists a  process zone \" in front of the crack tip in which plastic yield is accompanied by the evolution of damage cavities .",
    "a crucial aspect of this picture is the existence of a typical scale , @xmath3 , which is roughly the distance between the crack tip and the first void , at the time of the nucleation of the latter .",
    "the voids are nucleated under the influence of the stress field @xmath7 adjacent to the tip , but not _ at _ the tip , due to the existence of the plastic zone that cuts off the purely linear - elastic ( unphysical ) crack - tip singularities .",
    "the crack grows by coalescing the voids with the tip , creating a new stress field which induces the nucleation of new voids . in the picture of @xcite the scale @xmath3",
    "is also identified with the typical size of the voids at coalescence .",
    "a consequence of this picture is that the roughening exponent @xmath4 corresponds to the surface structure of individual voids , whereas the large - scale anomalous exponent has to do with the correlation between the positions of different voids that coalesce to constitute the evolving crack .",
    "@xcite provided first a theory for the scale @xmath3 and second , demonstrated that the positions of consecutive voids are positively correlated . in this paper",
    "we amplify on these results .    in sect .",
    "[ onevoid ] we discuss again the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , expand the theoretical presentation , and test the robustness of the roughening exponent that this model predicts . since the roughening exponent found",
    "is larger than 0.5 , this indicates the existence of positive correlations between crack increments . to illuminate these long range correlation",
    "we demonstrate in sect .",
    "[ long range ] that the analytic structure of the theory dictates the existence of power - law correlations between height fluctuations in the crack and the value of the mode ii stress intensity factor @xmath8 at the tip . in sect .",
    "[ twovoids ] we construct a model with two voids ahead of the crack . after setting up the problem ,",
    "we describe in some detail the mathematical apparatus that employs conformal maps from the annulus to the doubly connected region of a crack with a void which allows the computation of the stress field around such a configuration . in sect .",
    "[ twovoidsres ] we present results of the two - void model , and discuss the relevance of the results to the growth and roughening of cracks .",
    "the conclusion is that since the details of plastic deformations are not well understood the physics of crack growth is better described by the one - void model than the two - void model ; the stress field computed for a crack with one void ahead is physically acceptable as long as elasticity theory is relevant , but when the first void appears due to plastic events a correct determination of the stress field should include a better handling of the plastic zone .",
    "this must await future improvement of our understanding of plastic dynamics .",
    "a simple model for @xmath3 can be developed by assuming the process zone to be properly described by the huber - von mises plasticity theory @xcite .",
    "this theory focuses on the deviatoric stress @xmath9 and on its invariants .",
    "the second invariant , @xmath10 , corresponds to the distortional energy .",
    "the material yields as the distortional energy exceeds a material - dependent threshold @xmath11 .",
    "the fact that we treat this threshold as a constant , independent of the state of deformation and its history , implies that we specialize for `` perfect '' plasticity . in 2-dimensions",
    "this yield condition reads @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 are the principal stresses given by @xmath14    in the purely linear - elastic solution the crack - tip region is where high stresses are concentrated ( in fact diverging near a sharp tip ) .",
    "perfect plasticity implies on the one hand that the tip is blunted , and on the other hand that inside the plastic zone the huber - von mises criterion ( [ mises ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the outer boundary of the plastic zone will be called below the  yield curve \" , and in polar coordinates around the crack tip will be denoted @xmath15 .    whatever is the actual shape of the blunted tip its boundary can not support normal components of the stress . together with eq .",
    "( [ mises ] ) this implies that on the crack interface @xmath16 on the other hand , the linear - elastic solution , which is still valid outside the plastic zone , imposes the outer boundary conditions on the yield curve .",
    "below we will compute the outer stress field _ exactly _ for an arbitrarily shaped crack using the recently developed method of iterated conformal mappings @xcite . for the present argument we will take the outer stress field to conform with the universal linear - elastic stress field for mode i symmetry , @xmath17 for a crack of length @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the tensile load at infinity , the stress intensity factor @xmath20 is expected to scale like @xmath21 . using this field",
    "we can find the yield curve @xmath15 .",
    "typical yield curves for straight and curved cracks are shown in the insets of figs .",
    "[ straightsteps ] and [ pdf ] .",
    "the typical scale @xmath3 follows from the physics of the nucleation process .",
    "it is physically plausible that void formation is more susceptible to the growth of hydrostatic tension than to distortional stresses .",
    "we assume that void nucleation occurs where the hydrostatic tension @xmath22 , @xmath23tr@xmath24 , exceeds some threshold value @xmath25 .",
    "the hydrostatic tension increases when we go away from the tip and reaches a maximum near the yield curve . to see this note that on the crack surface @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "( [ ps ] ) ) . on the yield curve",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ uf ] ) and the huber - von mises criterion together to solve the angular dependence of the hydrostatic tension in units of @xmath27 .",
    "it attains a maximal value of @xmath28 and is considerably higher than @xmath29 for a wide range of angles .",
    "on the other hand the linear - elastic solution ( [ uf ] ) implies a monotonically decreasing @xmath22 outside the yield curve .",
    "we thus expect @xmath22 to _ attain its maximum value near the yield curve_. this conclusion is fully supported by finite elements method calculations , cf .",
    "finally , since the nucleation occurs when @xmath22 exceeds a threshold @xmath25 , this threshold is between the limit values found above , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "the void will thus appear at a typical distance @xmath3 , see fig .",
    "[ profile ] .",
    "an immediate consequence of the above discussion is that @xmath3 is related to the crack length via : @xmath31    note that @xmath3 is not a newly found length scale ; it is the well known scale of the plastic zone @xcite .",
    "its identification with the cross - over length between two scaling behaviors of the crack roughening is however new .",
    "this stems from the proposition that positive correlations appear only between the positions of nucleated voids . below",
    "@xmath3 one enters the regime of plastic processes whose theory is far from being settled .",
    "we should also comment that it is possible that positive correlations appear even below the scale of the plastic zone since experiments indicate that several voids nucleate within the plastic zone @xcite .",
    "we should therefore consider the estimate in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) as an upper bound on @xmath3 . finally , the fact that the plastic zone size scales with @xmath20 as proposed in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) results from the assumption of perfect plasticity , i.e. that @xmath27 is independent of the state of deformation and its history .",
    "this is _ not _ true for real materials ; usually @xmath27 is not sharply defined ; it can increase with plastic deformations @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , known as ",
    "work - hardening \" or  strain - hardening \" , might introduce other dependencies on @xmath20 and include other length scales that are related to the plastic deformations .",
    "we do not take such issues into account in this simple model .",
    "naturally , the precise location of the nucleating void will experience a high degree of stochasticity due to material inhomogeneities . since we do not know from first principles the probability distribution for void formation , we consider in our model below two possible distribution functions .",
    "in all cases nucleation can not occur if @xmath32 . for @xmath33",
    "the void occurs with probability + @xmath34 - 1 \\ . \\label{pexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the exponential case we considered two different values of @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ straightsteps ] we show three such pdf s as they appear for a perfectly straight crack .",
    "we note that these distributions are symmetric about the forward direction .",
    "nevertheless they have sufficient width to allow deviations from forward growth .",
    "these deviations will be responsible later for the roughening of the crack . for comparison examine also the pdf s for a general crack which are shown in fig .",
    "[ pdf ] . there",
    "the symmetry is lost : correlation to previous steps create a preference for the upward direction .",
    "this source of positive correlations is discussed below in greater detail .",
    "each growth step in our model is composed of two events .",
    "firstly the material yields near the crack tip , creating a plastic zone with a void growing somewhere at the zone boundary . secondly the crack tip and the void coalesce .",
    "we note that there is a separation of time scales between these two events .",
    "the first is slow enough to be governed by a quasi - static stress field .",
    "the second event occurs on a shorter time scale .",
    "it is clear that we forsake in the one - void model any detailed description of the geometry on scales smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "any relevant scaling exponent that will be found in this model will refer to roughening on length scales larger than @xmath3 . in experiments",
    "it appears that several voids may nucleate before the coalescence occurs , and in the next section we will explore models with two voids ahead of the crack . in the one - void model , the physical process in which the crack coalesces with the multiple voids ahead of it is substituted by a single void coalescence with the crack .    in spite of the simplification in dealing with only one void per step",
    ", it was demonstrated in @xcite that the one - void model induces positive correlations between consecutive void nucleations , leading eventually to an anomalous roughness exponent larger than 0.5 .",
    "clearly , even this simple model requires strong tools to compute the stress field around an arbitrarily shaped crack , to determine at each stage of growth the location of the yield curve and nucleating randomly the next void according to the probability distributions discussed above . in a recent work we have developed precisely the necessary tool in the form of the method of iterated conformal mappings @xcite .    in the method of iterated conformal mappings",
    "one starts with a crack for which the conformal map from the exterior of the unit circle to the exterior of the crack is known .",
    "( below we start with a long crack , in the form of a mathematical branch - cut of length 10000 , and @xmath3 is of o(10 ) ) .",
    "we can then grow the crack by little steps in desired directions , computing at all times the conformal map from the exterior of the unit circle to the exterior of the resulting crack .",
    "having the conformal map makes the _ exact _ calculation of the stress field ( for arbitrary loads at infinity ) straightforward in principle and highly affordable in practice .",
    "the details of the method and its machine implementations are described in full detail in @xcite . in the next section we present the theory in great detail for the two - void model , and avoid the repetition here .",
    "we should just stress that the method naturally grows cracks with tips of finite curvature , and each step adds on a small addition to the tip , also of a finite size that is controlled in the algorithm .",
    "having the stress field around the crack we can readily find the yield curve and the physical region in its vicinity where a void can be nucleated . choosing with any one of the probability distributions described above",
    ", we use this site as a pointer that directs the crack tip .",
    "we then use the method of iterated conformal mappings to make a growth step to coalesce the tip with the void .",
    "naturally the step sizes are of the order of @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "[ stepsize ] we present the actual step sizes as computed with the pdf ( [ plin ] ) , as a function of the crack length .",
    "the linearity ( in the mean ) in @xmath18 is obvious .",
    "note that the fluctuations about the mean are strongly dependent on the pdf , and could in principle be used to experimentally deduce the ` correct ' pdf by reverse engineering .",
    "we reiterate that this model forsakes the details of the void structure and all the length scales below @xmath3 . since we are making _ linear _ steps below @xmath3 , we anticipate having an artificial scaling exponent @xmath36 for scales smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "this is clearly acceptable as long as we are mainly interested in the scaling properties on scales larger than @xmath3 .    in fig .",
    "[ crack ] we present two typical cracks that were grown using this method .",
    "both cracks were initiated from a straight crack of length 10000 .",
    "the upper crack was grown using the broader exponential pdf of fig .",
    "[ pdf ] curve ( b ) .",
    "the lower crack was grown with the narrower pdf of fig .",
    "[ pdf ] curve ( a ) . clearly , the upper crack exhibits stronger height fluctuations , as can be expected from the wider pdf and the choice of parameters . for the lower crack forward growth is much more preferred . in the upper crack",
    "the positive correlations between successive void nucleation and coalescence events can be seen even with the naked eye .",
    "this is precisely the property that we were after . a neat way to see",
    "this tendency is in the pdf s as they are computed on the yields crack for a typical , rather than straight , crack . in fig .",
    "[ pdf ] we show these pdf s for the crack whose yield curve is shown in the upper panel . we see that now the symmetry of the pdf s is lost , and positive values of @xmath37 are preferred .",
    "this is the source of positive correlations that eventually give rise to the anomalous roughening exponent .",
    "this is born out by the measurements of the scaling exponent that we discuss next .",
    "a quantitative measurement of the positive correlations is the roughening exponent , that we compute as follows .",
    "measuring the height fluctuations @xmath38 in the graph of the crack , one defines @xmath39 according to @xmath40 for self - affine graphs the scaling exponent @xmath41 is defined via the scaling relation @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ h(r ) ] we present a typical log - log plot of @xmath39 vs. @xmath43 , in this case for the two cracks in fig .",
    "[ crack ] with power - law fits of @xmath44 and 0.68 respectively .",
    "indeed as anticipated from the visual observation of fig .",
    "[ crack ] the exponent is higher than 0.5 .",
    "it turned out that all the cracks grown by our algorithm gave rise to scaling plots in which a scaling range with @xmath45 is clearly seen .",
    "when the pdf allowed for a sizeable standard deviation , the cracks gave a very nice scaling plot with at least two decades of clear anomalous scaling .",
    "when the standard deviation was small , the scaling range was more meager , as seen in fig .",
    "[ h(r ) ] .",
    "it is interesting to stress that the anomalous scaling exponent appears insensitive to the pdf used ( although the extent of the scaling range clearly depended on the pdf ) .",
    "we note that our measured scaling exponents are very close to the exponents observed in 2-dimensional experiments .",
    "( of course we can not expect a 2-dimensional theory to agree with 3-dimensional experiments - the scaling exponents are , as always , dimension - dependent ) . in addition the value of @xmath3 does not effect the scaling properties of a crack , i.e. it does nt seem to matter how long the step is , so long as a wide distribution of angles is allowed .    growing directly at the tip of the crack results in a very strong preference for the forward direction , meaning that a step up will most likely be followed by a step down , and vice versa , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the physics of the plastic zone results in creating a finite distance away from the tip to realize the next growth step .",
    "another crucial issue is the existence of long range correlations .",
    "since this aspect was not made clear so far , we turn now to a discussion of the origin of power law correlations .",
    "the fact that the cracks generated by our model appear self - affine with hurst exponent @xmath46 implies that the physical mechanism underling the crack growth is a long range positive correlation process .",
    "we can gain intuition about the origin of the long range correlations by employing some known analytic results . consider a long mode i straight crack spanning the interval @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "suppose now that the crack shape is perturbed by a small out of plane fluctuation of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is small .",
    "in the presence of the perturbation the crack attains a small shear component @xmath50 at its tip .",

    "note that due to the fact that the crack is long we could set the lower limit of integration to @xmath54 .",
    "let us consider a positive perturbation @xmath55 that is symmetric around @xmath56 and decays to zero at a typical distance @xmath57 from @xmath56 . since in our configuration @xmath58 for @xmath59 , it is straight forward to show that eq .",
    "( [ perturb ] ) yields @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "note that @xmath8 is _ negative_. in order to understand the effect of the perturbation on the probability distribution function for the next void nucleation in our model , we recall that this probability is determined by the hydrostatic tension @xmath23tr@xmath24 . in the case of a pure tensile stress , @xmath62",
    ", @xmath22 is symmetric around @xmath63 and the probabilities of nucleating a void at positive or negative angles are the same . in the presence of a small negative shear component , @xmath64 , this picture changes .",
    "the maximal hydrostatic tension is obtained at @xmath65 since to first order in @xmath51 the mode i stress intensity factor @xmath66 is unchanged @xcite , we obtain that the peak of the distribution is shifted from zero to @xmath67 this relation shows that as a result of a positive perturbation in the crack shape at a distance @xmath43 behind its tip the probability to nucleate a void at a positive angle relative to the forward direction is _ higher _ than the probability to nucleate a void at a negative angle . moreover , this positive correlation is long ranged , decaying as @xmath68 .",
    "the presence of long range correlations is reassuring , since they are a must for the existence of a roughening exponent larger than 0.5 .",
    "note however that the above result does not determine in any direct way the numerical value of the roughening exponent itself .",
    "the actual exponent results from the cumulative effect of many height fluctuations , and at present we do not have an analytic theory predicting the numerical value of this exponent .",
    "contrary to self similar fractal growth patterns , where the fractal dimension @xmath69 can be computed from the knowledge of the first laurent coefficient of the conformal map @xcite , in self affine graphs it is not obvious how to extract the roughening exponent from the properties of the conformal map . at present",
    "we are bound to the laborious process of actually growing the crack and measuring the exponent .",
    "needless to say this is theoretically unsatisfactory , and new ideas on this issue should be very welcome .",
    "in this section we address the physical process of nucleation of a second void in front of the crack tip . to improve upon the one - void model we need to develop techniques to compute the exact stress field around a crack with one void ahead ( or a crack with two voids ahead , etc . ) .",
    "clearly , methods based on conformal maps from singly connected regions ( i.e. the unit circle ) can not suffice for this purpose . since conformal map techniques from doubly or multiply connected regions are far less familiar , and since the computation of stress field around doubly connected regions is interesting by itself , we present the necessary techniques in some detail .",

    "we review the basis of the relevance of conformal maps to the solution of the bi - laplace equation .",

    "this case is solvable analytically using bipolar coordinates @xcite , and therefore provides a unique testing ground for the precision of our method in a limiting case .    in this section",

    "such calculations exist in the literature ; one general method is known as the schwarz alternating method . in this method one",
    "solves the simply connected problems successively and superimposes them in such a way that the boundary conditions are satisfied when the procedure has converged ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we will assess our method by comparing with an analytical solution for two equally sized circular holes using bipolar coordinates @xcite .",
    "our method is quite genearal , allowing us to solve for the stress field in any doubly connected region by explicitly solving the elastic equations in a doubly connected geometry .",
    "the advantages of our method are that it allows freedom in choosing the shapes of the boundaries and it allows calculation of the stress field near highly singular shapes such as long cracks .",
    "the method can be implemented to very high precision as will be shown below .",

    "to proceed we represent @xmath82 and @xmath95 in laurent expansion form .",
    "note that @xmath82 and @xmath95 have a poles inside both the boundaries and therefore do not have a laurent expansion around infinity which is valid everywhere in the complex plane .",

    "[ sketch ] .",
    "a well known fact is that simply connected domains can be conformally mapped to any other simply connected domains ( relying on the riemann mapping theorem ) .",
    "however , when dealing with doubly connected domains there is an invariant quantity , called the modulus ( sometimes recasted as the extremal distance ) , which is preserved under conformal mappings . as a result only doubly - connected domains with the same modulus can be connected via a conformal map . for an annulus",
    "the conformal modulus is just the ratio of the inner radius and the outer radius , so that for the @xmath104 annulus , the modulus is simply @xmath105 .",
    "for that reason the specific annulus which is taken as the domain to be mapped onto the required crack+void domain can not be just any annulus , but has to be chosen correctly .",
    "suppose that we have such a conformal map @xmath106 ( examples are presented in the following subsections ) that maps the @xmath107-annulus domain onto the required physical @xmath99-plane with a crack and a void in front of it .",

    "( [ uphichi ] ) , knowing the solution to the bi - laplace equation in the annulus does not immediately provide the solution as the bi - laplace equation in the physical domain through a simple application of the conformal map , since in contrast to the laplace equation , the bi - laplace equation is not conformally invariant .",
    "nevertheless , the conformal mapping method can be extended to non - laplacian problems and provides a clear simplification of the problem since the boundary conditions are much easier to impose on a circular boundary than on the physical boundary .",
    "we begin by writing our unknown functions @xmath109 and @xmath95 in terms of the conformal map @xmath110 now , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are just analytical functions in the annulus , apart from a simple pole located at a point which is mapped to infinity in the @xmath99-plane , cf . fig .
