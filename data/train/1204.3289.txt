    "it is believed that the black hole ( bh ) accretion disc is an effective model for explaining the high energy radiation in astrophysics .",
    "the standard accretion disc ( ssd ) model was proposed by @xcite , in which the disc is geometrically thin and optically thick .",
    "the ssd is widely used in modeling the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of agn .",
    "the general relativistic ssd model has been investigated in detail by novikov & throne ( 1973 , hereafter nt73 ) , and page & throne ( 1974 , hereafter pt74 ) . in this ssd model , it has been assumed that there is no stress at disc s inner edge , i.e. the so - called `` no - torque inner boundary condition '' .",
    "however , the `` no - torque inner boundary condition '' was questioned by @xcite on the basis that magnetic fields are the likely agent of the torque in the discs @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that magnetic fields connecting the disc to the plunging region can exert stresses on the inner edge of an accretion disc around a black hole , and they recomputed the relativistic corrections to the thin - disc dynamics equations when these stresses take the form of a time - steady torque on the inner edge of the disc . @xcite also noted that , within the confines of a highly - idealized model of inflow dynamics , this torque can considerably enhance the amount of energy released in the disc .",
    "apart from ssd , advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) is another important model of the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "it is believed that black hole x - ray binaries present various spectral states , most notably the low / hard state , high / soft state and intermediate state .",
    "the ssd has been very successful in describing the high /soft states of galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) , but their low / hard state characterized by power - law  type spectra was problematic to the ssd .",
    "the adaf model is quite successful in reproducing the hard spectra of gbhcs , as well as those of low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) , however it also has a several problems .",
    "thus we can not expect to interpret the various components of spectra based on one accretion mode .",
    "the power - law spectra of gbhcs is generally explained by comptonization of softer photons by hot electrons from a magnetic corona on an accretion disc .",
    "@xcite proposed a high - temperature corona model analogous to solar corona , and the effects on the disc when part of the dissipation occurs in the corona were first discussed by @xcite . in the accretion disc - corona scenario ,",
    "an optically thin hot thermal corona is located above the surface of disc .",
    "a fraction of soft photons , which are from the cold disc , are compton up - scattered to x - ray photon by hot electrons . in this model the corona can explain the power - law x - ray spectra very well , and reprocessing of the coronal x - rays by the cold disc gives rise to the observed emission lines naturally .",
    "the iron @xmath3 fluorescence line provides us a diagnostic of the geometry of the accretion flow and the property of the space - time around the bh .",
    "recent work on the disc - corona model can be found in , e.g. @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the famous `` @xmath4-prescription '' to deal with viscosity , but the physical process leading to viscosity and turbulence in the disc remain unclear . the magnetic rotation instability ( mri ) of weak magnetic fields in accretion discs is thought to play an important role in the evolution and dynamics of astrophysical accretion discs .",
    "@xcite argued that this instability should have a rapid growth rate of the order of the orbital frequency @xmath5 , resulting in a greatly - enhanced effective viscosity that is able to transport angular momentum outward .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic fields generated in the ssd are strongly buoyant , and a fraction of the magnetic energy is transported vertically to heat the corona above the disc .",
    "the multi - wavelength observations of nearby llagns have revealed that the seds of llagns and of gbhcs in the low / hard state possess many similarities , e.g. flat , compact radio cores with high brightness temperatures , and a hard x - ray power - law with high a energy cut - off .",
    "@xcite pointed out that there should be a common accretion mode for these low luminosity black holes , and proposed a new model for low - luminosity black holes , in which a ssd at low accretion rates dissipates a large fraction of its gravitational energy in a magnetic corona .    motivated by the these results ,",
    "in this paper we shall investigate a disc - corona model , in which a geometrically thin , optically thick disc surrounds a rotating kerr bh , a magnetic field connecting the plunging region and the disc exerts a non - zero torque at the inner boundary of the disc , and the corona is assumed to be heated by the reconnection of the magnetic fields generated by buoyancy instability in the disc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the model in section 2 , where in a magnetic torque is exerted on the inner edge of the accretion disc . in section 3",
    "the global solutions of this disc - corona system are obtained , and the effects of different parameters on the fraction of accretion power dissipated into the corona are discussed . in section 4",
    "we simulate the emerged spectra by using a monte carlo method .",
    "finally , in section 5 , is the brief discussion . throughout this paper the geometric units",
    "@xmath6 are used .",
    "in our accretion disc - corona system , a geometrically thin and optically thick disc is sandwiched by a magnetic corona , and part of the gravitational energy of the accreted matter is released in the hot corona .",
    "the general relativistic model for a steady , axisymmetric , and thin keplerian disc around a kerr black hole has been described in detail by nt73 and pt74 . in their model",
    ", it has been assumed that there is no stress at disc s inner edge .",
    "the equation of angular momentum conservation is given as follows    @xmath7_{,r } = 4\\pi e^{\\nu + \\psi + \\mu } q l^ + , \\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the accretion rate of the disc,@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the metric coefficients , @xmath12 is integrated shear stress , @xmath13 is the specific angular momentum of a particle in the disc .",
    "the total gravitational power dissipated in unit surface area of the disc - corona system @xmath14 is given by    @xmath15    where the function of radius @xmath16 is defined by pt74 . in the case of `` no - torque",
    "inner boundary condition '' , the boundary condition on @xmath16at the radius @xmath17 of marginally stable orbit is @xmath18 .",
    "if it is taken into account that magnetic stresses exert a torque on the inner edge of the accretion disc , the appropriate boundary condition at @xmath17 is expressed as @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the additional radiative efficiency , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is general relativistic correction factor defined by pt74 .    using this boundary condition",
    "we have the new function @xmath16 of radius , that is    @xmath23 \\end{array } .\\ ] ]    @xmath24 and @xmath13 are the specific energy and the specific angular momentum of a particle in the disc , respectively , and they read    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27 is the dimensionless radial coordinate , and @xmath28 is the dimensionless black hole spin parameter .    the power dissipated in the corona ( i.e. the magnetic poynting flux in the vertical direction from the thin disc ) is    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the magnetic pressure in the disc , and @xmath31 is the velocity of magnetic flux transported vertically in the disc .",
    "here we assume the velocity @xmath31 of magnetic flux tubes is proportional to their internal alfven velocity , i.e. @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is related to the efficiency of buoyant transport of magnetic structure in the vertical direction inside the disc , which is of the order of unity for extremely evacuated tubes @xcite .",
    "now we give the equations of the disc structure as follows .",
    "the equation of vertical pressure balance in the vertically - averaged form is @xcite    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the height of the accretion disc , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are pressure and density of the disc respectively .",
    "@xmath38,@xmath39 , @xmath22,@xmath40 , @xmath41 are general relativistic correction factors defined as follows :    @xmath42    the equation of energy conservation is ( see eq.(5.6.13 ) in nt73 )    @xmath43    and @xmath12 is integrated shear stress defined as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the interior viscous stress in the disc .",
    "the equation of state for gas on the disc is    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the total pressure ( gas pressure plus radiation pressure ) at disc mid - plane , @xmath48 is the radiative constant .",
    "@xmath49 is the rest mass of proton , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the density of rest mass and the temperature in the disc , respectively .    in the ssd model",
    "the interior viscous stress @xmath45 is usually assumed to be proportional to the pressure , i.e. @xmath52    since the process of generating magnetic fields in the accretion disc is still unclear , we adopted different magnetic pressures as :    @xmath53    and as @xmath54 is a constant of the order of unity , we adopt @xmath55 in our calculations .    in the disc - corona scenario ,",
    "the soft photons from the disc are scattered by the electrons in the corona to x - ray bands .",
    "about half of the scattered photons are intercepted by the disc .",
    "it is a rough approximation because light bending effects ought to be taken into account at the vicinity of bh .",
    "the reflection albedo @xmath56 is relatively low @xmath57 , and most of the incident photons from the corona are re - radiated as black body radiation @xcite .",
    "thus the energy transport equation for the disc is    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the rosseland mean of total opacity which can be expressed as    @xmath60    and @xmath61 is adopted in the calculations .",
    "solving equations ( 2),(7)-(16 ) numerically , the power dissipated in the corona @xmath62 and the structure of the disc can be derived as function of @xmath63 .",
    "the ratio of the power dissipated in the corona to the total for such disc - corona system is given as    @xmath64    the concerned kerr metric coefficients are given by @xcite @xmath65",

    "in fact , the magnetic fields connecting the plunging region to the disc can exert stresses on the inner edge of the disc and transfer energy from the plunging region to the disc - coronae system .",

    "it is found that the fraction of the power dissipated into the corona in the total for such disc - corona system increases with the increasing the dimensionless black hole spin parameter @xmath0 , but is insensitive on the parameter @xmath20 for @xmath2 .",
    "we simulate the emerged spectra from the disc - corona system for the different parameters using the monte - carlo method .",
    "it is found that the spectral profile changes obviously with varying the height of the corona and the accretion rate of the disc .",
    "the reasonable geometry of the corona is important for simulating the emerged spectra using the monte - carlo method .",
    "we adopt a slab corona in this paper .",
    "however the geometry of the corona is still matter of debate , e.g. @xcite proposed a patchy corona that made of a number of separate active regions .",
    "furthermore , the observed correlation between the photon index and the reflection strength @xcite has demonstrated the need for further geometrical / dynamical parameters , such as the relativistic bulk motion velocity of the coronal material @xcite .",
    "our model needs to be improved in other aspects .",
    "for example , the gravitational effects on the trajectories of photons need to be taken into account , the cooling of synchrotron radiation should be considered and the ray - tracing should be used in our calculations .",
    "the magnetic pressure @xmath174 plays an important role in our model .",
    "in fact we can get the magnetic energy density from the coronal power @xmath175 as the coronal geometry is assumed .",
    "then the small - scale magnetic field @xmath176 in the corona can be derived from the magnetic energy density .    on the other hand , models and simulations of jet production @xciteshow that it is the poloidal component of the large - scale magnetic field which mainly drives the production of powerful jets .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed for acceleration and collimation of jets , which can be divided into two main regimes , the poynting flux regime and the hydromagnetic regime .",
    "both regimes are related to a poloidal magnetic field threading the disc or bh , from which energy and angular momentum are extracted . in the poynting flux regime ,",
    "energy is extracted in poynting flux ( i.e. purely electromagnetic energy ) , but in the form of magnetically driven material winds in the latter regime .",
    "furthermore , some authors have agreed that jet formation should involve an accretion disc threaded by a large - scale magnetic field @xcite .    though the origin of large - scale magnetic field is still under controversy",
    ", some previous works @xcite have proposed that the large - scale field can be produced from the small - scale field created by dynamo processes .",
    "the length scale of the fields created by dynamo processes is of the order of the disc thickness @xmath35 , and the poloidal component of the magnetic field is given approximately by @xmath177 if the field is created in the thin accretion discs ( @xmath178 , the large - scale field is very weak . for the adaf cases , the disc thickness @xmath179 and",
    "the poloidal component of the magnetic field shall be stronger . in our disc - corona scenario ,",
    "the energetically dominant corona are the ideal sites for launching the powerful jets / outflows @xcite .",
    "the large - scale magnetic fields created by dynamo processes in the corona are significantly stronger than the thin disc due to the corona being much thicker than the cold , thin disc .",
    "so the corona can power a stronger jet than the thin disc .",
    "we shall discuss the acceleration of jet in the poynting flux regime and the hydromagnetic regime in future work .",
