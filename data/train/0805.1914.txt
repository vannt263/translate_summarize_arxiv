    "these exceptional data constrained the precursor of sn 1993j to be a k supergiant of initial mass around 14m@xmath3 , but with a he core of only 3 - 6m@xmath3 at the time of the explosion ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we present spectroscopy and photometry of the he - rich supernova ( sn ) 2008ax . </S>",

    "<S> sn 2008ax displays the ordinary spectral evolution of a type iib supernova . </S>",
    "<S> a stringent pre - discovery limit constrains the time of the shock breakout of sn 2008ax to within only a few hours . </S>",
    "<S> its light curve , which peaks in the b band about 20 days after the explosion , strongly resembles that of other he - rich core - collapse supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the observed evolution of sn 2008ax is consistent with the explosion of a young wolf - rayet ( of wnl type ) star , which had retained a thin , low - mass shell of its original h envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the overall characteristics of sn 2008ax are reminiscent of those of sn 1993j , except for a likely smaller h mass . </S>",
    "<S> this may account for the findings that the progenitor of sn 2008ax was a wnl star and not a k supergiant as in the case of sn 1993j , that a prominent early - time peak is missing in the light curve of sn 2008ax , and that h@xmath0 is observed at higher velocities in sn 2008ax than in sn 1993j .    </S>",
