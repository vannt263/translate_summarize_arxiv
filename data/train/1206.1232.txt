    "flows associated to vector fields were one of the principle origins of the study of ergodic theory and dynamical systems and are indeed of foremost importance . frequently they are not at all simple to analyse .",
    "certain deceptively simple systems of differential equations and the associated flows still prove extremely difficult to understand . in the past",
    "many questions concerning flows were intractable with the technology available and much progress was made by first reducing to a discrete dynamical systems by considering poincar sections and encoding the flow as a suspension over the discrete - time dynamical system .    in the study of the statistical properties of discrete - time dynamical systems",
    "a major technological success of the last thirty years was the development of ideas to apply functional analysis directly to the system .",
    "this was developed by a long list of people but particularly by the pioneering work of lasota - yorke @xcite and subsequent development by keller ( see @xcite and references within for a more complete history ) . in this approach",
    "one typically considers a linear operator called the `` transfer operator '' acting on a certain well chosen banach space and then deduces information concerning the statistical properties from information concerning the spectrum of the operator .",
    "when liverani studied the rate of mixing of contact anosov flows @xcite he showed that the family ( parametrized by time ) of transfer operators associated to a flow can be viewed as a strongly - continuous one - parameter semigroup acting on a well chosen banach space .",
    "this had the benefit of allowing one to study the flow directly without first encoding to a suspension flow and again apply the breakthrough work of dolgophyat @xcite on the oscillatory cancelation mechanism .",
    "this seemed like a point of view which had great potential and indeed these ideas have since been proven useful .",
    "in particular they have helped deduce behaviour of the invariant measure of an anosov flow under perturbations @xcite , to study the rate of mixing for piecewise cone - hyperbolic contact flows @xcite and to study dynamical zeta functions , again for contact anosov flows @xcite .",
    "we remark that although studying the flow by considering the associated one - parameter semigroup of operators seems promising it is not the only possibility and tsujii has demonstrated @xcite that , certainly in the case of smooth expanding maps of the circle and contact anosov flows , it is possible to study directly the transfer operator associated to the time - one map of the flow .",
    "many statistical properties of many diverse classes of flows remain as open questions , for example rates of mixing for the sinai billiard flow and the lorenz flow . these are both flows which are simple to define but whose statistical properties remain elusive ( the corresponding questions for the poincar return maps associated to these flows are relatively well understood ) . from a technological point of view",
    "several issues must be better understood if we wish to extend our techniques to more general classes of flows , in particular understanding how to deal with discontinuities .",
    "a weight of evidence suggests that `` good statistical properties '' like exponential decay of correlation and continuous , or even differential , dependence of the invariant measure under perturbations , are the consequence of the smoothness of the system .",
    "the aim here is to use as much as possible the available smoothness of the system to deduce statistical properties in the situations where there is a limited degree of smoothness . in particular",
    "this is why we avoid the approach of reducing to a suspension flow which artificially reduces the smoothness of the system .",
    "we believe there are many benefits to streamlining and optimising the current technology to facilitate its use in more difficult settings .",
    "as mentioned above , there is now a very precise understanding of @xmath0 anosov flows and extremely precise spectral results , however , from a physical point of view such boundary - less smooth systems seem unrealistic . here",
    "we wish to consider the more realistic systems which only satisfy significantly weaker regularity assumptions . as such",
    "we study a relatively simple model , although much subtle and complex behaviour is visible and the results are indeed new .",
    "we study semiflows associated to @xmath1 vector fields on two - dimensional branched manifolds ( branched surfaces ) , possibly with boundary . despite the smoothness of the flow discontinuities",
    "are introduced because the flow is supported on a manifold with boundary .",
    "the existence of branches allows the semiflows to be non - invertible , i.e. they really are semiflows and not flows .",
    "we suppose these semiflows are uniformly expanding in a sense made precise below .",
    "we develop the theory of the one - parameter semigroup of transfer operators associated with these semiflows and we make several improvements and observations from a technical point of view .",
    "we achieve a spectral decomposition of the ( operator - valued ) laplace transform of the transfer operator .",
    "we show that the issue of the strong continuity of the semigroup can be easily avoided .",
    "furthermore we demonstrate an approach which means that it should be possible to study also perturbations of the flow on the same banach space , even in the case of flows with discontinuities , and so studying the behaviour of the statistical properties under the perturbation is made possible .",
    "we remark that the operator - theory framework presented in the following section is essentially independent of the present application to expanding flows on branched manifolds and should be applicable , with the appropriate choice of dynamically relevant banach space , to many other settings .",
    "we suppose that @xmath2 is a 2-dimensional @xmath1 branched manifold , possibly with boundary and with finite branches .",
    "definitions and notation concerning branched manifolds and their differential structure are given in section  [ sec : branchedmanifolds ] .",
    "in summary a branched manifold possesses a differential structure in much the same way as a riemannian manifold , in particular tangent space @xmath3 is uniquely defined at each point @xmath4 and there is an inner product @xmath5 for the tangent space which allows us to discuss orthogonality and consequently a norm @xmath6 .",
    "we suppose that we are given a vector field @xmath7 which is @xmath1 and such that the associated semiflow @xmath8 is globally defined . by _ semiflow _ we mean , as usual , that @xmath9 which we write as @xmath10 and which satisfies @xmath11 and @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "we also require that @xmath14 is uniformly expanding as made precise in the following .",
    "to characterise hyperbolicity for systems which are either not invertible or have discontinuities it is not possible to use the notion of an invariant and hyperbolic splitting of tangent space .",
    "one possibility would be to use the notion of conefields .",
    "however we opt for yet another alternative which is most suitable for this particular setting .",
    "we suppose there exists an orientatable @xmath1 foliation of @xmath2 which we denote @xmath15 such that the following three properties hold .    1",
    ".   the leaves of @xmath15 are all one - dimensional curves with end points contained in @xmath16 and of length greater than @xmath17 for some constant @xmath18 , 2 .",
    "the leaves of @xmath15 are uniformly transversal to the flow direction ,    and , letting @xmath19 denote the unit vector field tangent to the foliation @xmath15 , we suppose that there exists constants @xmath20 , @xmath21 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath22 for all @xmath23 , @xmath4 and @xmath24 .",
    "note well that the foliation @xmath15 will not be invariant under the action of the flow , except in extremely special ( non - mixing ) cases .",
    "the foliation in merely more - or - less in the expanding direction of the flow . also note that the assumption of the existence of the flow and of it being uniformly expanding in the above sense puts significant restrictions on the branched manifold .",
    "for example the flow lines at the boundary must be tangent to the boundary .",
    "many branched manifolds can not support such flows .    from this point",
    "onwards we assume always that the semiflow @xmath25 is a uniformly expanding semiflow on a two dimensional branched manifold as described above .",
    "the branched manifold @xmath2 is a measure space when equipped with the borel @xmath26-algebra .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the space of complex measures on @xmath2 .",
    "this is the dual of @xmath28 , the banach space of continuous complex - valued functions with support contained within some open subset of @xmath2 , equipped with the supremum norm @xmath29 . for",

    "the space @xmath32 is a banach space .",

    ". we will refer to the elements of this space as measures and omit explicit mention that they are complex measures . for later use",
    "let @xmath35 ( as opposed to @xmath28 ) denote the space of all continuous complex - valued functions on @xmath2 .",
