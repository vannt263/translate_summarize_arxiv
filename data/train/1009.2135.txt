    "a feynman diagram for the penner model is a double - edge graph of t hooft @xcite , which we call a _ ribbon graph _ following kontsevich @xcite .",
    "the reason that ribbon graphs appear in the calculation of the euler characteristic of the moduli space lies in the isomorphism of topological orbifolds @xmath7 due to harer @xcite , mumford @xcite , and strebel @xcite . here",

    "we refer to @xcite for the precise meaning of the equality .",
    "although the matrix integral ( [ eq : matrix ] ) gives an effective tool to calculate the euler characteristic @xmath22 it does not tell us anything about more refined information of the orbifold cell structure of @xmath14 .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath23 , we choose @xmath2 variables @xmath24 , and define the function @xmath25 an edge @xmath26 of a ribbon graph @xmath12 bounds two faces , say @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these two faces may be actually the same .",
    "now we define the _ poincar polynomial _ of @xmath14 in the @xmath15-variables by @xmath29 which is a polynomial in @xmath30 but actually a symmetric rational function in @xmath31 .",

    "reduction of the quantity @xmath45 by one has appeared in many recent works on moduli theory of curves , gromov - witten theory and related topics .",
    "this includes the operation of cutting off a pair of pants from a bordered surface as in @xcite , the hurwitz move or the cut - and - join equation of hurwitz numbers @xcite , the edge removal operation on @xmath14 of @xcite , and many generalizations including @xcite .    by the definition of @xmath35 and the fact that @xmath46 , the poincar polynomial recovers the euler characteristic of the moduli space @xmath0 as the special value @xmath47",
    "the poincar polynomial becomes particularly simple when @xmath48 .",
    "we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 an immediate generalization of the above formula is the diagonal value @xmath51 because of this formula our terminology of calling @xmath35 the `` poincar polynomial '' is justified .",

    "it requires the deep theory of mirzakhani @xcite to relate the leading terms @xmath56 and the intersection numbers because of the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath61 .",
    "the contribution of theorem  [ thm : appl ] is to identify the origin of the virasoro constraint condition as the edge - removal operation of ribbon graphs of @xcite , and to clarify the relation between the combinatorics of counting problems and the geometry of intersection numbers . for the moduli space of vector bundles on curves , harder and narasimhan used deligne s solution of the weil conjecture to obtain the poincar polynomial .",
    "although what we are dealing with in this article is much simpler than the situation of @xcite , we find that again a counting problem plays a key role in calculating the poincar polynomial . here",
    "the critical differences are that we use lattice point counting rather than moduli theory over the finite field @xmath62 , and that through ( [ eq : ftop ] ) the counting problem also leads to the intersection numbers of the _ compactified _ moduli space @xmath61 .",

    "this recursion proves the dvv formula of @xcite when restricted to the leading terms , and also proves the @xmath63-conjecture ( the theorem of @xcite ) when restricted to the lowest degree homogeneous terms . in a surprising similarity",
    ", we show that the laurent polynomial @xmath52 is the laplace transform of the number of grothendieck s _ dessins denfants _ @xcite .",
    "one can ask : _ why does the laplace transform appear in this context ? _ a short answer is that the laplace transform here is in fact the _ mirror map _ that transforms the a - model side of topological string theory to the b - model side .",
