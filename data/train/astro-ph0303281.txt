    "_ missing mass _ or dark matter in the universe has been well recognized as one of the central problems both in observational cosmology and in astro - particle physics for more than 20 years .",
    "nevertheless the nature of dark matter is hardly understood yet . _ missing baryons _",
    ", on the other hand , do not seem to have attracted much attention until very recently despite the fact that baryons are clearly the best understood component in the universe .",
    "@xcite are one of the first who explicitly pointed out the importance of studying the missing baryons , or _",
    "the cosmic baryon budget_. subsequent numerical simulations ( e.g. , ) indeed suggest that approximately 30 to 50 percent of total baryons at @xmath3 take the form of the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) with @xmath4 which has evaded any direct detection so far",
    ". unfortunately whim does not exhibit strong observational signature , and its detection has been proposed only either through the ovi absorption features in the qso spectra @xcite or the possible contribution to the cosmic x - ray background in the soft band @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported the first detection of the whim at low redshifts ( @xmath5 ) through the ovi absorption lines in the spectra of a bright qso h1821 + 643 observed by _ fuse _ satellite , and they found that the absorbers are collisionally ionized with the metallicity @xmath6 and have the number density @xmath7 . using _",
    "observatory , @xcite and @xcite also detected the absorption lines of ovii , oviii and neix at @xmath8 in the spectrum of pks 2155 - 304 .",
    "their spectral analyses indicate that the number density and temperature of the absorber are @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 k , respectively , with the coherent size being @xmath12 mpc .",
    "this may be interpreted as whim in the nearby filamentary structures .",
    "@xcite observed the high redshift ( @xmath13 ) ovi absorption line systems in several qso spectra .",
    "those are also interpreted as whim at high redshifts ; the strong spatial clustering of the absorbers implies that they may indeed trace the large - scale structure in the universe .    in those attempts to detect whim through the absorption line systems , the observations are quite limited to particular lines - of - sight toward qsos .",
    "the unbiased exploration of whim , however , requires a systematic survey - type observation , which motivates us to consider a possibility to identify emission line features of whim , in particular , those of ovii ( 561ev:1s@xmath141s2s ) , ovii ( 568ev:1s@xmath141s2p ) , ovii ( 574ev:1s@xmath141s2p ) , ovii ( 665ev:1s@xmath141s3p ) and oviii ( 653ev:1s2p ) .",
    "the major obstacle against this attempt is the galactic emission ; our galaxy harbors a significant amount of interstellar gas with similar temperature with whim , and the galactic emission is typically two orders of magnitude stronger than the expected whim emission @xcite .",
    "for instance , recently @xcite claimed the detection of ovii emission lines in the outskirts of galaxy clusters with _ xmm ",
    "newton_. unfortunately because of the limited energy resolution ( @xmath15 ev ) of the mission , it is not easy to distinguish the whim and the galactic components in a convincing manner .",
    "this indicates the importance of the energy resolution of a detector for a reliable identification of whim .",
    "in fact , we show below that with an energy resolution of @xmath16ev which is achievable in near future , one can distinguish the redshifted emission lines of ovii and oviii from other prominent galactic lines .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows ; section 2 summarizes the outline of our cosmological simulations and the model for metallicity evolution .",
    "section 3 discusses the major noise sources and requirements for the instrument for the successful detection of oxygen emission lines .",
    "we present the predicted mock spectra assuming fiducial parameters for our proposed mission in section 4 , and consider consider the detectability of the whim in section 5 .",
    "finally section 6 is devoted to implications and discussion of the present paper .",
    "we use the simulation data of @xcite , which are briefly described here .",
    "the simulation code is a hybrid of particle  particle  particle  mesh ( pppm ) poisson solver and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "we employ @xmath17 dark matter particles and the same number of gas particles within the periodic simulation cube of @xmath18 per side .",
    "we adopt a spatially - flat @xmath19cdm universe with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the density parameter , @xmath26 is the baryon density parameter , @xmath27 is the dimensionless cosmological constant , @xmath28 is the rms density fluctuation top - hat smoothed over a scale of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "thus the mass of each dark matter and gas particle is @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the initial condition is generated at redshift @xmath33 and is evolved up to the present .",
    "the ideal gas equation of state with an adiabatic index @xmath34 is adopted , and the effect of radiative cooling is incorporated using the cooling rate of @xcite adopting a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath35 we also implement the cold gas decoupling technique for the phenomenological treatment of the multi - phase nature of baryons ; we decouple radiatively cooled gas particles from the remaining gas particles and regard the former as stellar components in galaxies , which provides an approximate prescription of galaxy formation .",
    "the effects of energy feedback from supernovae and the uv background heating are ignored in our simulation .",
    "all the cosmological observations are carried out over the past lightcone . in the present study , this is particularly important because we do not know _ a priori _ the redshifts of the corresponding whim along the line - of - sight . in order to properly model a realistic observation surveying a @xmath36 region ,",
    "we create the lightcone data as schematically illustrated in figure  [ fig : lightcone ] ; we first stack eleven simulation cubes at different redshifts sampled from @xmath3 to @xmath37 .",
    "the size of the survey area corresponds to the simulation boxsize at @xmath37 ; @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the angular diameter distance toward a redshift @xmath40 .",
    "specifically we use data at @xmath3 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ( due to the limited number of outputs , we sometimes have to use data at the same redshift twice ) . in order to avoid the artificial coherent structure along the line of sight",
    ", we randomly choose a position in the cube and periodize the particle positions , and also randomly exchange the @xmath47- , @xmath48- and @xmath40-axes in constructing the light - cone output .",
    "since the resolution of our cosmological simulations is insufficient to trace the metallicity evolution , we have to adopt an ad - hoc model for the chemical evolution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "oxygens that we are interested in here are mainly produced via type ii supernovae in galaxies , and are generally believed to be ejected into intergalactic space via the supernova - driven galactic wind and/or other dynamical processes like mergers and tidal interaction of two galaxies ( e.g. , ) . for definiteness , we consider the following four possibilities in order to bracket the plausible range of observational and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "model i : : :    the metallicity is set to be @xmath49    independently of redshifts and the densities of the igm .",
    "model ii : : :    the metallicity is assumed to be spatially uniform but increase in    proportion to the cosmic time @xmath50 :    @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the    age of the universe .",
    "model iii : : :    the metallicity is assumed to be correlated with the local igm density    @xmath53 relative to the mean baryon    density of the universe @xmath54 . to be    specific , we adopt    @xmath55    from our fit to the metallicity ",
    "density relation at @xmath3    of the galactic wind driven metal ejection model of @xcite .",
    "model iv : : :    we assume the similar gas density dependence of the metallicity as    model iii but use the fit to the radiation pressure ejection model of    @xcite where the stellar light exerts radiation pressure on the    interstellar dust grains and expels them into the hosting galactic    halos and the ambient igm .",
    "actually , we find that the results of    @xcite in this model have the density dependence of the metal    distribution similar to that of model iii except for the overall    normalization :    @xmath56    note that @xcite concluded that only the radiation pressure ejection    model ( model iv ) reproduces the typical metallicity in intracluster    medium , while the observed metallicity of lyman-@xmath57    clouds at @xmath58 may be accounted for by both    models iii and iv .",
    "in this section , we discuss the contaminating sources in detecting the emission lines of whim and the requirements for the detector and the telescope to evade such contaminations .",
    "the major contaminating sources are the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) and the emission lines of hot gas which resides in the galactic halo . according to @xcite ,",
    "nvii ( 500ev ) and cvi ( 368ev ) are the other prominent lines in the galactic emission below oxygen line energies .",
    "the oviii line of whim at @xmath59 that we consider here is free from the confusion with the above two lines , and thus we focus on the energy range between 500ev and 700ev .",
    "thus the detection threshold in this energy range is basically determined by the intensity of the cxb .",
    "@xcite suggested that the absolute intensity of the cxb below 1 kev has a systematic error of 2030 % in comparison with the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ measurements . strictly speaking ,",
    "however , the soft component of the `` cxb '' is supposed to be dominated by the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "@xcite found that the _ asca _ gis diffuse background spectrum after removing the point source contributions consists of a hard power - law component and a soft component .",
    "more importantly they found that the intensity of the soft component varies significantly from field to field ( its @xmath60 fractional variation amounts to @xmath61% of the average cxb intensity ) , and indeed becomes stronger toward the galactic center ; the spatial distribution is well fitted with a finite disk model with a radius of @xmath62 , and a scale height of @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the distance to the galactic center .",
    "this implies that the soft component ( below 1 kev ) is dominated by the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "they estimated the average flux of 6@xmath65 erg @xmath66s@xmath67sr@xmath67 between 0.5 and 0.7 kev by averaging 91 fields , corresponding to the flux density of @xmath68 erg @xmath66s@xmath67sr@xmath67kev@xmath67 .",
    "the primary requirement for the detector of the whim emissions is its high energy resolution to distinguish the oxygen lines of whim at an intermediate redshift from their galactic counterparts .",
    "the observational features of the galactic emission lines are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "they observed @xmath69 sr sky centered at @xmath70 with a resolution of 9 ev , and found the line intensities of @xmath71 photons @xmath66s@xmath67sr@xmath67 ( @xmath72 erg @xmath66s@xmath67 sr@xmath67 ) for the ovii triplet and of @xmath73 photons @xmath66s@xmath67sr@xmath67 ( @xmath74 erg @xmath66s@xmath67 sr@xmath67 ) for the 653 ev oviii line . with a better energy resolution ( @xmath756 ev ) ,",
    "the lines of @xmath76 can be separated from the galactic components .",
    "in addition , the separation of ovii triplets may lead to the estimation of the temperature of whim from their line ratios .",
    "another important requirement is the high efficiency of the throughput of the telescope .",
    "since the emission lines of whim are generally weak , we need large @xmath77 for their successful detection , where @xmath78 is the effective area and @xmath79 is the total field - of - view of detectors . to realize a large mirror with @xmath80 100@xmath81deg@xmath82",
    ", we are currently pursuing the possibility of 4-stage x - ray telescopes ( furuzawa et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "in contrast to the standard 2-stage x - ray mirrors , 4-stage telescopes will be able to achieve a shorter focal length and a wider field - of - view .",
    "the short focal length makes it possible to construct a smaller detector with the same field - of - view .",
    "this is essential for the x - ray micro - calorimeters to simultaneously achieve a small heat capacitance and a good energy resolution .",
    "we simulated a nested 4-stage telescope with a diameter of 60 cm and a focal length of 70 cm by a ray - tracing program , and found that the throughput at 0.7 kev is @xmath83 @xmath81deg@xmath82 with @xmath84 being the overall efficiency of the detector ( furuzawa et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "consider a detector with the effective area @xmath78 , the field - of - view @xmath85 , and the energy resolution @xmath86 at the line energy @xmath87 .",
    "then the signal - to - noise ratio of emission lines is written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the flux of emission lines averaged over the given size of pixels on the detector , and @xmath90 is the exposure time .",
    "the denominator in the above expression indicates the noise level contributed from the cxb and the poisson noise of emission from whim in terms of the corresponding number of photons .",
    "figure  [ fig : limit ] shows the signal - to - noise ratio of oviii 653 ev emission lines for various values of @xmath91 as a function of a flux of the lines , where we adopt @xmath92ev as a nominal energy resolution of our fiducial detector .",
    "this indicates that in the case of @xmath93 cm@xmath14 deg@xmath14 sec and @xmath95 cm@xmath14 deg@xmath14 sec , one can detect emission lines with fluxes greater than @xmath96 erg @xmath66 sec@xmath67 sr@xmath67 and @xmath97 erg @xmath66 sec@xmath67 sr@xmath67 with sufficient ( @xmath98 ) statistical significance , respectively .",
    "actually , the emission from hot intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in galaxy clusters can be also an important contaminating source .",
    "for the central regions of galaxy clusters , the emission from icm is predominant , and thus the identification of ovii and oviii lines becomes difficult at directions toward such regions .",
    "therefore , the detection limit inferred from equation  ( [ eq : detection_limit ] ) may be interpreted as a lower limit .",
    "this contamination , however , is important only in central regions of galaxy clusters . actually , as we will see below",
    ", the emission lines above the detection threshold inferred from equation  ( [ eq : detection_limit ] ) generally produce detectable spectral signatures .    considering the transmission of the entrance window and the quantum efficiency of the detector",
    ", a realistic value of @xmath84 may be @xmath99 0.5 . in what follows , therefore , we assume the detector throughput of @xmath100 , and the spectroscopic energy resolution of @xmath101 .",
    "the field - of - view @xmath85 may be chosen somewhere in a range of @xmath102 to @xmath103 , and is filled with a detector array of @xmath104 pixels .",
    "this specification is compared with the on - going / planned x - ray missions in table  [ tab : detector ] , where the expected sensitivities for the emission lines of current and proposed x - ray satellite missions are summarized .",
    "the first two are the current working missions ; _ chandra _ @xcite has a good spatial resolution of @xmath105 ( fwhm ) and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite has a large effective area of 1200 @xmath81 . while _",
    "chandra _ has the transmission grating spectrometers hetg and letg , and _ xmm - newton _ has the reflection grating spectrometer , rgs , the energy resolution of those grating instruments for diffuse emission lines is worse than those of x - ray ccds .",
    "table  [ tab : detector ] lists the sensitivities of x - ray ccd detectors , acis - s3 for _ chandra _ and epic - pn for _ xmm - newton_. astro - e ii ( http://www.astro.isas.ac.jp/astroe ) is a japan - usa mission which will be launched in 2005",
    ". the xrs detector will be the first x - ray micro - calorimeter in orbit and have an energy resolution of 6 ev .",
    "due to the small effective area and the field - of - view , however , the sensitivity of the xrs is worse than that of xis consisting of four x - ray ccds .",
    "the _ constellation - x _ ( http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov ) is a us mission of high throughput consisting of four space - crafts .",
    "the flux limit is estimated on the basis of the current design of sxt and tes ( transition - edge sensor ) calorimeters with 2 ev energy resolution .",
    "the _ xeus _ ( http://astro.estec.esa.nl/xeus/ ) will have a huge x - ray mirror of 6 m@xmath82 and tes calorimeters .",
    "since those missions are all designed as x - ray observatories for general purposes , both a large effective area and a good spatial resolution are preferred and the field - of - view has to be necessarily smaller . on the other hand , the nested 4-stage telescope that we propose here is feasible even with a small satellite , and still the sensitivity for the diffuse x - ray line emission exceeds those of the larger missions . in this sense",
    ", it has important and complementary advantages over other current / future x - ray missions .",
    "we divide the entire lightcone data , which we describe in section 2 , into @xmath106 square grids on the celestial plane and 128 grids equally spaced along the redshift direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcone ] ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath107 cells in total . for the @xmath108-th cell ,",
    "we compute the surface brightness @xmath109 due to the emission lines of ovii and oviii as @xmath110 @xmath111 where the summation is over the gas particles ( labelled @xmath112 ) within the @xmath108-th cell . in the above expression",

    ", we assume the collisional ionization equilibrium in computing @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "strictly speaking , however , this assumption may not be completely valid in most regions of the whim . adopting the typical whim parameters ( @xmath124 @xmath10 and @xmath125k ) , for instance",
    ", the recombination timescale of hii @xmath126 yr significantly exceeds that of of the collisional ionization ( @xmath127 yr ) .",
    "nevertheless we adopt the collisional ionization equilibrium for simplicity as in the case of all the previous simulation studies of the absorption lines due to the whim .",
    "we plan to discuss the non - equilibrium effect elsewhere .",
    "figure  [ fig : emissivity ] shows the emissivities of ovii and oviii lines as a function of gas temperature , where we set the metallicity as @xmath128 , from the table in the spex ver 1.10 ( http://www.rhea.sron.nl/divisions/hea/spex ) .",
    "the intensity of ovii emission lines , a triplet of 574 ev , 581 ev and 588 ev , is peaked around at @xmath129 k , and the oviii 653 ev line becomes dominant at @xmath130 k.    figure  [ fig : oviii_map ] shows the total intensity maps of ovii and oviii emission lines of whim ( _ left panels _ ) and the bolometric x - ray emission ( _ right panels _ ) integrated over the redshift range of @xmath131 ( _ upper panels _ ) , @xmath132 ( _ middle panels _ ) , @xmath133 ( _ lower panels _ ) .",

    "on the other hand , at @xmath146 k and @xmath143 k , oviii line at @xmath147 ev and many fexvii lines at @xmath148 ev emerge .    using the template spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : template ] ) and the proposed detector specification , we construct mock emission spectra of whim over the lightcone data as follows .",
    "first we compute the total photon numbers on each @xmath149 grid due to the three components ; the whim emission spectra according to equation  ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) , the cxb contribution adopting @xmath150=6@xmath65 erg @xmath66s@xmath67sr@xmath67 between 0.5 and 0.7 kev and a photon index @xmath151=6 @xcite , and the galactic emission lines of oxygen and nitrogen as observed by @xcite . in practice , we compute the numbers of photon per each spectroscopic bin assuming a given exposure time",
    ". then we assign the additional photon number fluctuations per each bin according to the corresponding poisson statistics .",
    "the energy spectrum of photons is convolved with the response function of a detector which we approximate by a gaussian with a fwhm of 2ev .",

    "[ fig : oviii_map ] . strong lines in the upper panel correspond to the galactic emission lines of nvii at 498 ev , ovii at 561ev , 568 ev , 574 ev , and 665 ev , and oviii at 653 ev .",
    "clearly the separation of the galactic component from the whim emission lines is the most essential . in order to mimic the realistic separation procedure",
    ", we construct an independent realization of spectra which consists purely of the cxb and galactic emission lines but using the different sets of random numbers in adding the poisson fluctuations in each bin .",
    "then the latter spectra are subtracted from the mock spectra ( whim + cxb and galactic emissions ) , which yields a residual mock spectrum purely for the whim ( _ dots with poisson error bars in lower panel _ ) . for comparison",
    ", we plot the noiseless whim spectrum from simulation in solid line .",
    "the emission lines with labels in the lower panel indicate oviii and ovii triplet lines whose surface brightness exceeds our nominal limiting flux ( see the top - right panel of figure  [ fig : wide_los ] ) .",
    "the oviii emission lines from the whim at @xmath153 can be indeed observed as the residual prominent emission lines between @xmath154 ev , though they are also contaminated by other emission lines .",
    "thus this plot indicates that the emission lines exceeding the residual photon number @xmath155 counts / bin are detectable with a three - day exposure .    in reality ,",
    "the continuum spectra from cxb , galactic diffuse , and whim would be hard to be separated . as indicated in the above idealistic example , however , the continuum level of the whim emission is just within the fluctuation of the cxb and the galactic emission .",
    "thus the uncertainty of the continuum level does not affect the identification of the emission lines using the proper line fitting procedure .",
    "the absorption due to the interstellar medium of the galaxy is another possible source for systematic errors in detecting the whim emission . at a photon energy of @xmath156kev ,",
    "the dominant absorption is due to the galactic oxygen as well as other metals .",
    "the oxygen abundance is usually assumed to be in proportion to the galactic neutral hydrogen .",
    "so one can use the observed column density of neutral hydrogen @xmath157 in inferring the degree of the absorption .",
    "figure 1 of @xcite indicates that the absorption cross section around @xmath156kev is @xmath158cm@xmath14 for 1 solar metallicity .",
    "so the regions of the sky with @xmath159 @xmath66 and @xmath160 @xmath66 decrease the soft x - ray intensity around @xmath156kev by 20% and 7% , respectively .",
    "in other words , if we preferentially select survey fields with @xmath161 @xmath66 , the absorption is less than 10% . therefore even taking account of the uncertainty of the metal abundance and @xmath162",
    ", we expect that the absorption effect may be corrected within a few percent accuracy .",
    "we illustrate results corresponding to two different types of observational strategies .",
    "one is a relatively shallow blank survey which attempts to detect the whim over the large fields in an unbiased manner .",
    "the other is a deeper survey which observes the pre - selected areas , for instance , the regions surrounding x - ray luminous clusters to search for the connecting filamentary whim from the clusters .",
    "the detector that we have roughly in mind here has an array of @xmath104 pixels over the total field - of - view of @xmath163 deg@xmath14 , which has a better angular resolution than that of our simulation grids ( @xmath164 arcmin ) .",
    "the higher angular resolution is in any case useful in removing the point sources , etc . in reality , however , a reasonably low detection threshold , i.e. , @xmath165 cm@xmath14 deg@xmath14 sec discussed in the previous subsection , can be achieved only by merging many pixels at the expense of the angular resolution depending on the adopted value of @xmath90 . here",
    ", we assume that the total field - of - view is @xmath166 deg@xmath14 which corresponds to @xmath167 simulated grids .    with those in mind ,",
    "we perform two simulated observations according to the above two strategies , respectively .",
    "the first adopts @xmath152 sec and combines the @xmath167 simulated grids",
    ". then the spatially resolved region corresponds to the the field - of - view of 0.88 deg@xmath14 , and @xmath168 cm@xmath14 deg@xmath14 sec .",
    "the second adopts @xmath169 sec and combines @xmath170 grids .",

    "[ fig : oviii_map ] ) , which are not visible in the x - ray thermal bremsstrahlung emission ( see right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : oviii_map ] ) .",
    "the spectra along the region b exhibit a strong oviii emission line at @xmath181 ev , which originates from the intra - cluster medium of the x - ray cluster at @xmath179 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oviii_map ] ) .",
    "the ovii triplet emission lines around @xmath182 ev are also ascribed to the same cluster .",
    "the region a sweeps the outer region of the cluster which is expected to contain less dense ( @xmath183 ) but hotter ( @xmath184 kev ) igm .",
    "in fact we do see a relatively mild oviii emission line at the cluster redshift .",
    "finally in the region c we detect a strong oviii emission line at @xmath185 ev and ovii triplet lines at @xmath186 ev from a cluster at @xmath187 as well as weaker emission lines at @xmath188 ev from the galaxy groups at @xmath189 .",
    "turn to next the simulated deeper survey .",
    "figure  [ fig : deep_los ] is the same as figure  [ fig : wide_los ] but for the three regions d , e , and f. the detection limit for those plots is @xmath190 erg s@xmath67 @xmath66 sr@xmath67 for @xmath176 in the case of @xmath191 cm@xmath14 deg@xmath14 sec .",
    "the region d shows an emission line due to a substructure of a cluster at @xmath192 , and all the three regions exhibit the presence of galaxy groups at @xmath193 .",
    "the spectra in the regions d and e show the emission lines from the galaxy cluster and its substructure at @xmath192 .",
    "we note that the emission line in the region d corresponding to the @xmath192 structure is stronger than the counterpart in the region e , although the temperature of the region d at @xmath192 is @xmath194 k and in fact lower than that of the region e ( @xmath195 k ) .",
    "this is because the emissivity of oviii decreases as the temperature exceeds @xmath196 k , and clearly demonstrates that the oxygen lines are more sensitive to the presence of the whim than that of the higher temperature gas associated with intra - cluster gas .",
    "the comparison of figures  [ fig : wide_los ] and [ fig : deep_los ] with figure  [ fig : oviii_map ] indeed reveals that the whim that evades the detection in the x - ray is indeed detectable in its emission features in both shallow and deep surveys that we simulate here .",
    "so far we show the results only for the metallicity model i. in order to show the dependence on the assumption of metallicity , figure  [ fig : spec_metallicity ] compares the spectra of the region d for the four metallicity models described in the last section .",
    "since the emission lines in this region come from the whim at low redshifts , the metallicity evolution hardly changes their intensities . on the other hand ,",
    "the model assumption on the density dependence significantly changes the result . among the four models that we consider ,",
    "model iv predicts the strongest emission lines , especially of oviii at @xmath197 ev and ovii triplet at @xmath198 ev , while the other three models predict very similar emission intensities .",
    "this is because model iv assumes the metallicity larger than @xmath199 for high density gas particles with @xmath200 , which mainly reside in the intra - cluster medium .",
    "the emission lines from mildly dense regions including the oviii line in @xmath201 ev , on the other hand , are not sensitive to the metallicity model .    figure  [ fig : scatter1 ] plots the distribution of temperatures and densities for all the 0.098 deg@xmath14 regions over the entire survey of @xmath202 .",
    "the different symbols indicate the range of surface brightness of emission lines for oviii 653ev ( _ left panels _ ) and ovii 561ev ( _ right panels _ ) .",
    "top to bottom panels correspond to the four different metallicity models .",
    "note that the temperature and density of each region are estimated by smoothing over the fixed _ angular _ scale ( 0.098 deg@xmath14 ) , and therefore the corresponding physical smoothing lengths @xmath203 are different depending on the redshift of each region ; @xmath204mpc , @xmath205mpc and @xmath206mpc at @xmath207 , 0.2 and 0.3 , respectively",
    ". therefore , the actual density is @xmath208 times higher than the smoothed density .",
    "the oviii emission lines from regions with @xmath209 erg s@xmath67 @xmath66 sr@xmath67 , for instance , probe the baryonic matter with @xmath210 k and overdensity of @xmath211 almost independently of the metallicity models . the ovii 561ev emission lines , on the other hand , are sensitive to the whim with @xmath212k and @xmath213 , relatively higher temperature and higher density regions than those probed by oviii . in the temperature range of @xmath214",
    "k , the emissivity of oviii is higher than that of ovii .",
    "thus one expects that when the ovii triplet emission lines are detected , the corresponding oviii emission line should also show up at the same redshift .",
    "then one may estimate of the whim temperature using the line intensity ratios between oviii and ovii as long as the whim is well approximated as a single temperature structure .",
    "in reality , the whim over each smoothed region may be in a multi - temperature phase , and in this case the temperature estimation becomes more complicated since the ovii emissivities have their peaks around @xmath215 k while the oviii emissivity is larger than those of ovii lines at @xmath216 k. finally because of the rapid decrease of the emissivity of ovii and oviii below 10@xmath217 k , it is unlikely that one may detect whim with @xmath218 k through the oxygen emission lines .",
    "in this paper , we have examined in detail the detectability of whim through oviii and ovii emission lines using a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of intergalactic medium . assuming a detector which has a large throughput @xmath219 cm@xmath14 deg@xmath14 and a high energy resolution @xmath220 ev , we have presented simulated spectra of whim in the collisional ionization equilibrium at soft x - ray band @xmath221 ev .",
    "since the metallicity distribution in intergalactic space is quite uncertain , we adopted four simple and phenomenological models .",
    "in all the models we found that within the exposure time of @xmath222 sec our proposed detector can reliably identify oviii emission lines of whim with @xmath0 k and @xmath223 , and ovii emission lines of whim with @xmath214 k and @xmath224 . the whim in these temperature and density ranges can not be detected with the current x - ray observations except for the oxygen absorption features toward bright qsos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let us remark three important issues related to the detectability of the whim .",
    "while they are beyond the scope of the present paper , we are currently working on those , and hope to report the results elsewhere in due course .    1 .",
    "our analysis has assumed that the whim is in the collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "strictly speaking , however , this assumption may not be justified in most regions of the whim , since the recombination time - scale is longer than the age of the universe .",
    "for example , in the region with @xmath225 @xmath10 and @xmath125k , the recombination time - scale of hii is @xmath226 yr , while the time - scale of the collisional ionization is much shorter @xmath127 yr .",
    "thus , whim is thought to be in over - ionized state , and emission lines can be produced by recombination and subsequent cascades in contrast to the collisional ionization equilibrium state .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear if the non - equilibrium effect increases or decreases our present estimate of the oxygen line emission without accurate numerical calculation",
    ". therefore , we plan to perform a proper treatment of the non - equilibrium ionization evolution to determine the line intensities of ovii and oviii .",
    "furthermore @xcite pointed out that the resonant line scattering of the cxb photons by oviii and ovii ions can exceed the thermal emission in the relatively low - density whim with @xmath227 and @xmath228 k. since the thermal emission lines that we computed mostly come from the higher density and higher temperature regions ( @xmath229 and @xmath230 k ) , the effect of the resonant line scattering may not be dominant .",
    "nevertheless it should tend to increase the overall detectability of whim .",
    "the ability of an unambiguous identification of ovii and oviii lines in the observed spectra is an important issue that we have to address .",
    "if both oviii and ovii lines at the same redshift are detected simultaneously , the identification is relatively easy .",
    "if one detects oviii lines but no corresponding ovii counterparts , one has to worry about the possibility for other contaminating lines such as fe xvii lines and oviii ly-@xmath231 line .",
    "if we have very hot ( @xmath232k ) at redshift @xmath233 , fe xvii lines show up at @xmath234ev and contaminate oviii lines at low redshift . actually , figures  [ fig : wide_los ] and [ fig : deep_los ] show emission lines of fexvii in our simulated spectra for some regions , which are significant contaminations against the proper identification of whim emission line systems .",
    "another important issue is how to estimate the temperature and density of the whim from the oviii and ovii lines .",
    "these are crucial in discussing the cosmological implications of the whim signature from the given survey area .",
    "finally we would like to emphasize that a dedicated x - ray survey mission with the capabilities assumed in the present simulation is now under serious consideration .",
    "the size and mass of the satellite will be as small as ( 1.5 m)@xmath235 and less than 300 kg .",
    "the scientific payloads will incorporate several advanced technologies that have been developed for the past and future japanese x - ray astronomy missions .",
    "the basic structure of the x - ray telescope is a thin - foil multi - mirror type already used for asca and astro  e ii .",
    "the major innovation in the design optimized for the dedicated whim survey is the use of 4 reflection telescope , i.e. , x - rays are reflected by 4 conical - shape mirrors .",
    "this technique achieves a substantial reduction of the focal length down to 6070 cm , by a factor of @xmath236 relative to that of the 2 reflection type .",
    "thus the extremely compact satellite becomes possible .",
    "a preliminary study shows that our requirement , @xmath237 cm@xmath14deg@xmath14 , can be achieved in the energy band 0.50.7 kev with the mirror outer diameter of 36 cm .",
    "the focal plane instrument will be an array of tes micro - calorimeters , cooled by mechanical coolers and adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators .",
    "the energy resolution is 2 ev and the sensitive area of the detector is about 1.5 cm @xmath238 cm consisting of even up to 1024 pixels .",
    "such a detector can cover @xmath239 field if the focal length is less than 86 cm .",
    "the current status of the detector development will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we expect that within 23 yrs the required techniques for the survey of whim will be quite feasible , and hope that the small satellite will be launched before 2010 .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for several constructive comments .",
    "we also thank k.masai and s.sasaki for helpful discussions .",
