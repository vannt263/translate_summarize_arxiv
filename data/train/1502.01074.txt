    "consensus algorithms have been recognized as an important step in a variety of decentralized and distributed algorithms , such as the rendezvous problem , distributed convex optimization or distributed sensing .",
    "we pose and solve in this paper what we term the _ weighted consensus _",
    "problem over a directed graph . specifically , given a set of positive weights assigned to the agents",
    ", we say that the agents reach a weighted consensus if they converge to the weighted average of their initial conditions  a formal definition to be given shortly .",
    "as is commonly done , we assume that the information flow in the system is described by a directed graph . our goal is to determine which weighted averages can be computed for a given information flow .",
    "furthermore , we describe how the agents can communicate over the graph to _ design _ the dynamical system whose evolution reaches the desired weighted consensus . computing a weighted average rather than",
    "a simple average is a natural one when the agents in the system are not all on equal footing .",
    "for example , think of a rendezvous problem where the rendezvous position depends on the initial positions of only a small group of agents ; of distributed sensing , where the weighting can be proportional to the accuracy of the sensing device , or of opinion dynamics , where participants may have different levels of influence on the decision process .",
    "because of their broad relevance , a fair amount is already known about consensus algorithms .",
    "indeed , questions concerning sufficient and/or necessary conditions for agents to reach consensus ( @xcite ) , questions concerning time delay ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) , consensus with quantized measurements ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) , consensus with time varying network topologies ( @xcite ) , and questions about convergence rate ( @xcite ) , robustness ( @xcite,@xcite ) in the presence of an adversary have all been treated to some degree .    broadly speaking , the problem we address in this paper is one of _ feasibility of an objective given decentralization constraints_. similar questions , but involving controllability of linear systems  @xcite , stability of linear systems  @xcite and formation control  @xcite have also been investigated . while the general problem of feasibility of an objective under decentralization constraints is far from being completely understood , we shall see that a fairly complete characterization can be obtained in the present case , in the cases of both discrete- and continuous - time dynamics .",
    "however , still open questions remain , such as : how to handle negative weights ? how to handle time - varying information flow graphs ? how to make sure that no - agent can  game the system \" and increase or decrease its assigned weight ?",
    "we next describe the model precisely .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath0 agents @xmath1 evolving in @xmath2 , and that the underlying network topology is specified by a directed graph ( or simply _ digraph _ ) @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the set of vertices and @xmath5 the set of edges .",
    "we let @xmath6 be a subset of @xmath7 comprised of the outgoing neighbors of vertex @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 and we assume in this paper that each agent @xmath10 can only observe its outgoing neighbors .",
    "the equations of motion for the @xmath0 agents @xmath11 are then given by @xmath12 with each @xmath13 a non - negative real number , which we call the interaction weight .",
    "the objective of the system is characterized by positive real numbers @xmath14 .",
    "we define the _ objective function _ @xmath15 as : @xmath16    the feasibility question we ask is the following : given a digraph @xmath17 , and a weight vector @xmath18 in @xmath19 , does there exist a set of non - negative interaction weights @xmath20 such that for any initial condition @xmath21 in @xmath2 , all agents will converge to the same point in @xmath2 specified by the objective map , i.e. , @xmath22 for all @xmath23 . in other words",
    ", we require that all the agents not only reach consensus , but also converge to a specific point which is a weighted sum of the initial positions of the agents . in the following section",
    ", we will convert this problem to one of asking whether there exists a sparse , infinitesimal stochastic matrix @xmath24 with a fixed zero pattern ( specified by the digraph ) such that @xmath24 has a simple zero eigenvalue with the vector @xmath25 being the corresponding left eigenvector .    in the paper",
    ", we will provide a complete answer to the question of weighted consensus within model  .",
    "in particular , we will characterize not only the set of objective maps which are feasible by choices of interaction weights , but also the set of interaction weights for a feasible objective map .",
    "note that the problem of evaluating averages in a _ distributed _ manner has also been handled using discrete - time dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ defthm ]",
    ", we introduce some definitions and state the main results of the paper .",
    "precisely , the main theorem characterizes the set of objective maps that can be realized over a given network topology .",
    "section iii is devoted to the proof of the main theorem . in section",
    "vi , we present a decentralized algorithm for finding a set of interaction weights associated with a feasible objective map .",
    "in particular , we relate the set of interaction weights to solutions of graph balancing .",
    "we provide conclusions in the last section .",
    "the paper ends with an appendix .",
    "in this section , we introduce the main definitions used in this work , formulate the weighted consensus problem in precise terms , and state the main result of the paper .",
    "we consider in this paper only _ simple _ directed graphs , that is directed graphs with no self loops , and with at most one edge between each ordered pair of vertices .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 a directed graph where @xmath7 is the vertex set and @xmath5 the edge set .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 an edge of @xmath27 , with @xmath8 and @xmath28 the start - vertex and the end - vertex of the edge , respectively .",
    "a vertex @xmath29 is said to be a * root * of @xmath27 if for all @xmath30 , there is a path from @xmath8 to @xmath29 .",
    "we say that @xmath27 is * rooted * if it contains a root .",
    "graphs with only one vertex are by convention rooted .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the set of all roots of @xmath27 .",
    "the digraph @xmath27 is _ strongly connected _ if , for any ordered pair of vertices @xmath32 , there is a path from @xmath8 to @xmath28 . in this case , all vertices of @xmath27 are roots , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "it is well known that if the digraph @xmath27 associated with system   is rooted , then all agents converge to the same state for all initial conditions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , if for any initial condition , all agents of system   converge to the same state , then the underlying digraph must be rooted .",
    "hence , we only consider rooted digraphs as the underlying digraphs of system  . for a subset @xmath34 , we call @xmath35 a subgraph of @xmath27 _ induced _ by @xmath36 if @xmath37 and @xmath38 contains any edge of @xmath5 whose",
    "start - vertex and end - vertex are in @xmath36 .",
    "we have the following definition :    [ def : relsub ] let @xmath3 be a rooted digraph , and @xmath36 be a subset of @xmath7 .",
    "we say @xmath36 is * relevant to @xmath27 * ( or simply * relevant * ) if it satisfies the two conditions :    1 .",
    "the set @xmath36 is contained in the root set @xmath39 ; 2 .   the subgraph @xmath35 induced by @xmath36 is strongly connected .",
    "for @xmath27 a digraph with @xmath0 vertices , we can always let @xmath40 .",
    "we denote by @xmath41 $ ] the @xmath42-simplex contained in @xmath19 with vertices the standard basis vectors @xmath43 . for @xmath34",
    ", we define similarly @xmath44 $ ] as the convex hull of @xmath45 : @xmath46 : = \\left\\ { \\sum_{i \\in v ' } \\alpha_i e_i \\mid \\alpha_i \\geq 0 , \\sum_{i \\in v ' } \\alpha_i = 1 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] we use the notation @xmath47 to denote the _ interior _ of @xmath44 $ ] : @xmath48 if @xmath36 is comprised of only one vertex , say vertex @xmath8 , we then set @xmath44=\\operatorname{sp}(v ' )   = \\ { e_i\\}$ ] .",
    "we introduce a similar notation to denote a convex cone .",
    "let @xmath49 , for @xmath50 , be vectors in @xmath51 ; we denote the convex cone spanned by @xmath49 by @xmath52 : =   \\left\\ { \\sum_{i=1}^l \\alpha_i c_i \\mid \\alpha_i \\geq 0 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] we denote its interior by @xmath53    we say a matrix @xmath24 is an * infinitesimal stochastic matrix ( ism ) * if its off - diagonal entries are non - negative , and its rows sum to zero .",
    "let @xmath27 be a digraph with @xmath0 vertices .",
    "we let @xmath54 be the set of @xmath0-by-@xmath0 isms with the following properties : @xmath55 if , for @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 if @xmath27 consists of only one vertex , then @xmath58 is a singleton .",
    "let @xmath59 be a vector of all ones in @xmath19 ; then for each matrix @xmath24 in @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 .",
    "so each matrix @xmath24 has at least one zero eigenvalue .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that if @xmath24 is an ism , then the real parts of eigenvalues of @xmath24 are non - positive . in particular ,",
    "if the digraph @xmath27 is rooted and @xmath62 for each @xmath63 , then the matrix @xmath24 has a simple zero eigenvalue .",
    "we start by formulating the targeted consensus problem in view of the facts introduced above .",
    "first , note that we can rewrite   into a matrix form as follows : let @xmath64 be an @xmath0-by-@xmath65 matrix with @xmath66 the @xmath8-th row of @xmath64 . then",
    ", system   is equivalent to @xmath67 with matrix @xmath24 contained in @xmath54 . for the purpose of reaching consensus",
    ", we require that the matrix @xmath24 have a simple zero eigenvalue .",
    "let @xmath68 $ ] be the left eigenvector of @xmath24 corresponding to the zero eigenvalue .",
    "then , for any initial condition @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 if we write @xmath18 , then @xmath71 conversely ,",
    "if the expression above holds for all initial conditions , then the matrix @xmath24 must have @xmath72 as a left eigenvector and zero as a simple eigenvalue .",
    "we thus introduce the following subset of @xmath54 :    let @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "we define the set of * @xmath72-feasible dynamics * @xmath73 as the set of isms satisfying :    1 .",
    "the matrix @xmath24 has a simple zero eigenvalue .",
    "the vector @xmath25 is the left eigenvector of @xmath24 corresponding to the zero eigenvalue , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "so the question we raised in the first section can be restated as follows : for a given digraph @xmath27 and a vector @xmath75 $ ] , is the set @xmath76 empty ?",
    "we answer this question in theorem  [ main ] :    [ main ] let @xmath3 be a rooted digraph , and @xmath77 be the relevant subsets of @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath78 be a subset of @xmath41 $ ] comprised of vectors @xmath25 for which @xmath76 is nonempty . then",
    ", @xmath79    we now consider briefly the case of discrete - time dynamics and show that essentially the same result holds .",

    "in particular , we provide a canonical decomposition of @xmath109 into disjoint subsets .",
    "moreover , we show that the closure of @xmath97 is the closed convex cone of the relaxed @xmath72-feasible dynamics .",

    "we have shown how the set of feasible objective maps @xmath438 can be related to a decomposition of the space of stochastic matrices in propositions  [ 4lem1 ] ,  [ mrg ] , and  [ sc ] .",
    "finally , we also presented a decentralized algorithm for agents in a network to implement a selected set of interaction weights that achieves a feasible objective map .",
    "future work may focus on the case where the interaction weights @xmath13 s are allowed to be negative .",
    "note that in the case when @xmath13 s are non - negative , the vector @xmath25 associated with a feasible objective map has to be in the unit simplex .",
    "thus , if @xmath438 is an objective map with @xmath439 $ ] , and if there is a choice of @xmath13 under which @xmath438 is feasible , then there must exist some @xmath13 which is negative .",
