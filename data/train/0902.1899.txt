    "due to the relative simplicity of the derivation of their thermodynamic properties , classical one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems are frequently employed as a test bed of theory and methods for collective behavior in higher dimensional systems . for instance , the collection of  hard spheres \" on a line , sometimes referred to as the tonks gas  @xcite , has served as an initial step in the study of two- and three - dimensional systems of hard disks / spheres .",

    ", we employ such methods to study a gas of hard needle - shaped objects .",
    "our object is to compare the analytical results with those obtained by ( monte carlo implementation ) of a formalism that relates thermodynamic properties ( specifically the pressure and elasticity coefficient ) of the gas to the probabilities of contact amongst the particles .",
    " hard \" potentials , which are either zero or @xmath0 , help to illuminate the geometrical / entropic features of a thermodynamic system .",
    "since there is no energy scale arising from such potentials , the temperature @xmath1 appears only as a multiplicative factor in the free energy and various other thermodynamic quantities , such as pressure and elastic coefficients .",
    "thus the state of the system becomes independent of @xmath1 , and only depends upon such features as density .",
    "the clarity of the geometrical perspective , combined with the simplicity of numerical simulations , has lead to extensive studies of such systems .",

    "for example , in the nematic phase the molecules have no positional order ( like a liquid ) , while their orientations are aligned to a specific direction . from the early stages research into liquid crystal it was realized that the _ entropic _ part of the free energy related to non - spherical shapes of the molecules , can by itself explain many of the properties of such systems  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , hard potentials were frequently invoked , and even such simplifications as infinitely thin disks  @xcite or rods  @xcite have provided valuable insights regarding liquid crystals . the interplay between the rotational and translational degrees of freedom in molecular solids  @xcite leads to elastic properties that are coupled to orientational order .",

    "typical terms correspond to a variety of possible contacts between particles and numerous components of the separations between them ( see , e.g. , eq . 23 in ref .",
    "since these expressions are obtained after numerous mathematical transformations , it is advisable to subject them to independent tests .",
    "indeed they have been shown to reduce to the known results for isotropic objects , but up to now there had been no comparison with exact results for non - spherical particles . here ,",
