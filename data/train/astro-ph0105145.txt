    "thus one can avoid the problem to find local calibrators with the same metallicities as the globular cluster stars .",
    "in addition , white dwarfs are locally much more abundant than metal - poor subdwarfs , thus enlarging the reference sample .",
    "photometric observations alone , however , are not sufficient to select the appropriate local calibrators : hydrogen - rich da s and helium - rich db s can in principle be distinguished by their photometric properties alone in the temperature range @xmath58k @xcite .",
    "@xcite classified two white dwarfs in ngc6752 as db s by this method and @xcite speculate that the brightest white dwarf in m4 ( v=22.08 ) might be a hot ( 27,000k ) db star .",
    "however , without a spectral classification , those stars could also be high - mass da white dwarfs , possibly a product of merging .    also , the location of the white dwarf cooling sequence is highly sensitive to the white dwarf mass .",
    "@xcite argued that the white dwarf masses in globular clusters are constrained to the narrow range 0.51@xmath59 m@xmath60 0.55 , but some systematic differences between clusters are obvious : at a given metallicity some globular clusters ( e.g.  ngc6752 ) possess very blue horizontal branches whose low - mass extreme hb stars evolve directly to low mass c / o white dwarfs ( bypassing the agb ) and shift the mean white dwarf mass closer to 0.51 .",
    "other clusters show only red hb stars , which will evolve to the agb and form preferably white dwarfs with masses of @xmath160.55 .",
    "in addition , low mass white dwarfs ( m@xmath510.45 ) with a degenerate he core ( instead of the `` normal '' c / o core ) are produced if the red giant branch evolution is terminated by binary interaction before the helium core exceeds the minimum mass for the onset of helium burning .",
    "recently , @xcite found 3 faint uv - bright stars in ngc6397 which they suggest could be helium - core white dwarfs ( supported by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "massive white dwarfs on the other hand may evolve from blue stragglers or result from collisions of white dwarf - binaries with subsequent merging ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . @xcite",
    "discuss the effects of atmospheric composition and mass on the white dwarf distance determination of globular clusters in more detail .",
    "due to the faintness of these stars their study by spectroscopic observations is still in its infancy , but first spectroscopic observations of the white dwarf candidates in ngc  6397 @xcite , ngc  6752 , and m  4 @xcite showed that all of them are hydrogen - rich da white dwarfs .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy at better s / n should allow to derive atmospheric parameters and thereby to verify the distances to these globular clusters .",
    "this section provides a brief summary of the most important points discussed in this paper :    * abundances and rotational velocities of hb stars show a sharp change at temperatures of about 11,000  k to 12,000  k , with the cooler stars displaying the expected cluster abundances and relatively high rotational velocities .",
    "the hotter stars show rather low rotational velocities and abundances best explained by diffusion . *",
    "diffusion , esp .",
    "radiative levitation of heavy elements , can most probably solve the problem of the low gravities found previously for hb stars between @xmath1611,500  k and @xmath1620,500  k. * the faint gap along the blue tail at @xmath61 separates hot hb from extreme hb stars .",
    "the brighter gap at @xmath61 to @xmath16 is probably caused by the onset of radiative levitation in the atmospheres of the hb stars .",
    "non - canonical evolutionary scenarios are probably not necessary to explain these gaps or the results of spectroscopic analyses of hot hb / blue tail stars . * the physical parameters of cool blue hb stars in metal - poor globular clusters agree with canonical evolutionary tracks , but yield canonical masses preferably for the long distance scale . *",
    "hot hb stars in metal - rich globular clusters form a rather inhomogeneous group , that can not be explained by _ one _ evolutionary scenario .",
    "* hot uv bright stars selected by far - uv observations show the theoretically expected distribution of evolutionary stages , contrary to optically selected hot uv bright stars , which are biased towards luminous post - agb stars . the considerable percentage of stars avoiding the thermally pulsing agb might explain the lack of planetary nebulae in globular clusters . * white dwarfs in globular clusters",
    "so far have been verified to be hydrogen - rich da white dwarfs .",
