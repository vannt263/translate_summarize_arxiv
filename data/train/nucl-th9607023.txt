    "in the category of `` exotic '' nuclear structure properties we can include the neutron skin and the neutron halo observed in ground - state configurations of light neutron rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "a rigorous definition of neutron skin and of neutron halo can not be given .",
    "therefore , we will show here an example of both structures to elucidate their features and to show their basic properties .",
    "the effect of neutron skin structure has been recently investigated @xcite and has been shown to be responsible for a low energy excitation mode , decoupled from the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance @xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate on the effects of the neutron halo structure .",
    "in particular , we will show its importance in relation to the low energy electric dipole transition mechanism in @xmath2be .",
    "an example of neutron skin structure is shown in figure [ fig : o_potential ] . there , the result of a mean - field calculation using hartree - fock method @xcite is shown for the two nuclei @xmath9o ( in the upper part ) and @xmath10o ( in the lower part ) .",
    "the calculations were performed using the common skyrme - s3 interaction , but the general features of the result can be deduced with any other kind of effective interaction . in the upper part of the figure , the mean - field potential for protons ( left ) and neutrons ( right ) is shown together with the bound single - particle energy spectrum . in this double - magic nucleus ,",
    "neutrons and protons occupy analogous single - particle orbits located at comparable energies .    in the lower part of the figure ,",
    "the same type of calculation is shown for the very neutron rich @xmath10o ( n=20 ) nucleus , a double - magic nucleus too . in this case",
    "the neutrons occupy single - particle states with energies very different compared to the proton case . moreover , the fermi energies of protons and neutrons are very different here due to the much larger neutron number",
    ". a plot of the densities for these two nuclei would reveal a thick neutron configuration `` covering '' the proton density distribution .",
    "a typical shell model configuration can be seen in the mean - field calculation shown in figure [ fig : o_potential ] . in the case of @xmath10o ,",
    "the _ s _ and _ d _ shells are both occupied and the single - particle ordering of the states is the usual @xmath11 . the last occupied orbit is therefore the @xmath12 orbit .",
    "a different situation is encountered when similar calculations are performed for the neutron rich @xmath2be nucleus .",
    "it is well known @xcite that its ground state is a @xmath13 state with a dominant configuration .",
    "this is in contrast with the normal single - particle ordering , where the @xmath14 orbit is occupied before the @xmath15 orbit .",
    "this peculiar configuration , together with the very low binding energy , 0.505 mev , builds up the neutron halo structure of the @xmath2be ground state .",
    "the mean - field potential for @xmath2be is shown in figure [ fig:11be_potential ] .",
    "the tail component of the corresponding neutron density , extending well outside the nuclear surface ( defined by a root - mean - square radius of @xmath16 fm @xcite ) can be seen in figure [ fig:11be_density ] .    there",
    ", the neutron and proton densities are shown as calculated by the hartree - fock method with a skyrme - m * interaction",
    ". the standard hartree - fock calculation would produce a ground - state with a @xmath14 configuration . to simulate the experimental situation ,",
    "the results shown in the figure are obtained forcing the ground - state to be a @xmath15 state .",
    "also shown in the figure is a neutron density with an added yukawa - tail determined by fixing the binding energy of the ground - state . in this way ,",
    "the resulting neutron density compares well with the experimentally derived density .",
    "it should be noted that the wave function corresponding to the @xmath15 orbit in a woods - saxon potential itself can reproduce the external part of the neutron density .    in the calculations of the capture cross section shown below",
    "we have used this wave function to evaluate the electric dipole matrix elements .",
    "the peculiar structure properties briefly described in the previous section have been shown to exhibit strong influence on nuclear excitation modes @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will show the results of the effect of the neutron halo structure on electric dipole transitions .",
    "these can be investigated , in principle , in both the reaction directions : in the neutron capture as well as in the coulomb dissociation process .",
    "our group has recently investigated the effect of the nuclear wave function component in the external region on the neutron capture process @xcite .",
    "we have calculated several neutron capture cross sections of light nuclei using the direct radiative capture ( drc ) model .",
    "the calculations for @xmath17c@xmath18 and @xmath19o@xmath18 reactions have been compared with recent experimental results from direct measurements @xcite .",
    "the drc reaction mechanism may be responsible for the most part of the capture reaction cross section in the particular condition in which the density of states is low enough to hinder the compound nucleus formation .",
    "furthermore , because the halo structure arises mainly from loosely bound _ s",
    "_ orbits ( see the discussion above ) , electric dipole @xmath20-ray emissions can only be induced by incident _",
    "p_-wave neutrons .",
    "in fact , the drc process is essentially determined by the e1 transition matrix elements @xmath21 in the case of incident _ p_-wave neutrons , these matrix elements are very much sensitive to the tail component of the final capturing state wave function @xmath22 and very little sensitive to the treatment of the incident channel neutron scattering state @xmath23 @xcite . the energy dependence as well as the strength of e1 emission due to incident _ p_-wave neutrons is therefore strongly influenced by the neutron halo structure of the residual nucleus capturing state .",
    "whether this state is the ground or an excited nuclear state makes no difference in this scheme .    as mentioned above",
    ", we can compare the @xmath0be@xmath1be drc cross section with that derived from the experiment in the inverse kinematics : the coulomb dissociation of @xmath2be .",
    "a recent coulomb dissociation experiment has been performed using the radioactive beam line rips at riken @xcite . a schematic view of the process is shown in figure [ fig:11be_diss ] .",
    "note that in the actual experiment , the dissociation from the first excited state at @xmath24 mev ( @xmath25 ) does not take place because all the nuclei of the incident beam are in their ground state .",
    "the electric dipole strength distribution @xmath26 , as measured in the coulomb dissociation experiment , can be related to the neutron capture cross section , @xmath27 , by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the excitation energy and @xmath30 the emitted neutron wave number .",
    "this relation is only valid for the present combination of angular momentum values .",
    "the results of the drc calculation in comparison to the experimental values derived from the coulomb dissociation experiment and converted into the neutron capture channel are shown in figure [ fig:10be_ng ] .",
    "as a first comment to this result , one has to note that the experimental values have to be compared only to the calculation including the @xmath31 transition because , as noted above , the experiment only includes incident @xmath2be nuclei in their ground - state .",
    "the next feature which can be seen in the figure is that the low energy part , where the experimental uncertainty is lowest , is quite well reproduced by the calculation .",
    "this can be interpreted as a confirmation of the halo structure of the ground - state of @xmath2be .",
    "in fact , the matrix elements which enter in the expression for the drc capture given above can be decomposed into a product of three factors @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spectroscopic factor of the bound state , @xmath34 a geometrical factor containing only angular momentum coupling constants and @xmath35 is the radial part of the overlap between the initial and final state . now ,",
    "if the initial state only consists of _ p_-wave neutrons in the continuum , its wave function is simply given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is a spherical bessel function ) .",
    "the drc cross section is proportional to the square of the overlap integral @xmath39 and is , therefore , nothing but a fourier - bessel transformation of the bound state radial wave function @xmath40 .",
    "a measure of the capture cross section ( or of the coulomb dissociation cross section ) is a measure of the wave function in the fourier space .",
    "then , the low energy part of the capture cross section plot corresponds to large values of the radial coordinate which is influenced by the halo configuration .",
    "finally , the fluctuations in the measured values at @xmath41 mev , though still masked by a large experimental uncertainty , may contain information on a @xmath2be excited state .",
    "in fact , the first state above the neutron emission threshold is at @xmath42 mev ( corresponding to @xmath43 mev ) @xcite and has @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "it can be populated by electric quadrupole excitation with the emission of _ d_-wave neutrons .",
    "should the experimental uncertainty be reduced to the level of the low energy part , the structure of this @xmath2be excited state could be deduced .",
    "we have shown that the halo structure of light neutron - rich nuclei can be investigated in the frame of a simple drc model .",
    "we have shown this in the particular case in which the cross section was not obtained in a direct measurement but derived from an experiment in the inverse kinematics .",
    "this technique can be very useful to study `` exotic '' nuclear structure properties .",
    "in addition , it can be utilized to obtain neutron capture cross sections for unstable nuclei where direct measurements are not possible .",
    "this possibility is particularly important for applications in nuclear astrophysics @xcite where neutron capture reaction rates are needed to investigate primordial ( big - bang ) as well as stellar nucleosynthesis .",
