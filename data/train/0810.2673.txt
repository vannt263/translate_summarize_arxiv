    "no substantial progress seems to have been made on this over the last few years .",
    "a standard method to reduce a more sophisticated problem in banach algebra theory to a simpler one is to use quotients .",
    "when dealing with operators between banach algebras , we , of course , need invariant ideals to perform this . in section  [ sec : quotients ] we discuss the interplay between properties of a ( / ) operator and the operator it induces on suitable quotient banach algebras in a fairly general setting and recover recent results for operators preserving the essential spectral radius on @xmath14 in  @xcite .",

    "the relevance of the value at  @xmath54 will be discussed in the next section . when considering the possibility of replacing `` invertibility - preserving '' by `` / '' we must keep in mind that ( a )  _ every _ bounded linear mapping defined on a commutative is / ( since spectral radius and norm coincide in spaces of the form @xmath55 ) ; ( b )  a  finite trace on a is a spectral contraction , hence , already on the @xmath56 matrices there is a unital / onto  @xmath57 which is not a jordan epimorphism . notwithstanding this",

    "the latter carries a natural topology , the jacobson topology , which can be pulled back to @xmath178 , and then to @xmath177 , to turn them into topological spaces in a canonical way . since @xmath16 is a commutative unital , @xmath179 allows several equivalent descriptions of which we choose the one via maximal ideals . for each maximal ideal @xmath180 of @xmath16 , the closed ideal @xmath181",
