    "cp@xmath0 models are a class of models in which the fundamental field is a complex @xmath1-component unit vector ( more precisely , an element of the complex projective manifold cp@xmath0 ) , and which are characterized by a global u(@xmath1 ) symmetry and a local u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "they emerge as effective theories of su(@xmath1 ) quantum antiferromagnets  @xcite and of scalar electrodynamics with a compact u(1 ) gauge group .",
    "the simplest three - dimensional ( 3d ) cp@xmath0 lattice model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where the sum is over the nearest - neighbor sites of a cubic lattice , @xmath6 are @xmath1-component complex vectors satisfying @xmath7 .",
    "the model is ferromagnetic for @xmath8 , antiferromagnetic for @xmath9 .",
    "the cp@xmath10 model can be mapped onto the o(3)-symmetric heisenberg model .",
    "indeed , if one defines o(3 ) spins @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the pauli matrices , one can rewrite the cp@xmath10 hamiltonian as that of the usual 3-vector heisenberg model . as a consequence , the critical properties can be straightforwardly derived by using the wealth of results available for the heisenberg model , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "several aspects of the phase behavior of cp@xmath0 models with @xmath13 remain unclear and worth being further investigated .",
    "the critical behavior of these models can be investigated by constructing an effective landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory .",
    "this approach requires the identification of the order parameter associated with the critical modes . assuming that the critical behavior is essentially driven by gauge - invariant modes , a plausible choice for ferromagnetic ( @xmath8 ) systems is the gauge - invariant site variable  @xcite @xmath14 which is a hermitian and traceless @xmath15 matrix . in the corresponding lgw theory ,",
    "the fundamental field is therefore the most general traceless hermitian matrix @xmath16 , which one can imagine being defined as the average of @xmath17 over a large but finite lattice domain .",
    "the hamiltonian is the most general fourth - order polynomial in @xmath18 consistent with the u(@xmath1 ) symmetry : @xmath19 for @xmath20 one recovers the o(3)-symmetric lgw theory because the cubic term vanishes and the two quartic terms are equivalent @xcite , consistently with the equivalence between the cp@xmath10 and the heisenberg model . because of the presence of the cubic term , on the basis of mean - field arguments , one expects the system to undergo a first - order transition for any @xmath13 , unless the hamiltonian parameters are tuned so that @xmath21 in the effective model .",
    "this prediction is , however , contradicted by recent numerical studies @xcite , which find evidence of continuous transitions in models that are expected to be in the same universality class as that of the 3d cp@xmath3 model . in particular ,",
    "a numerical study of 3d loop models  @xcite provided the estimate @xmath22 for the correlation - length critical exponent .",
    "these results imply the existence of a 3d cp@xmath3 universality class characterized by a u(3 ) global symmetry and u(1 ) gauge invariance , with a corresponding fixed point ( fp ) that can not be determined in perturbation theory at fixed @xmath1 . in order to access this fp , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a double expansion around @xmath20 ( where the cubic term vanishes ) and @xmath23 , arguing that a continuous transition may be possible for values of @xmath1 sufficiently close to @xmath20 . for larger values of @xmath1 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath24 , the numerical analyses  @xcite show evidence of first - order transitions . in the large-@xmath1 limit",
    ", the quantum field theory corresponding to the ferromagnetic cp@xmath0 model gives rise to an effective abelian higgs model and landau - ginzburg ( lg ) theory of superconductivity  @xcite , whose renormalization - group ( rg ) flow presents a stable fp for a sufficiently large number of components .",
    "thus continuous transitions are again possible in cp@xmath0 models at large @xmath1 , sharing the same universal critical behaviors of the lg theory of superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "these results are again in contrast with the conclusions obtained from the lgw theory ( [ hlg ] ) and suggest that , at least for large values of @xmath1 , critical modes are not exclusively associated with the gauge - invariant order parameter @xmath25 , cf .",

    "we investigate the critical behavior of antiferromagnetic cp@xmath0 ( acp@xmath0 ) models , such as those described by the hamiltonian ( [ hcpn ] ) with @xmath26 , on a cubic lattice ( we expect a similar behavior on any bipartite lattice ) . for @xmath20 ,",
    "they undergo a critical transition in the same universality class as that of the ferromagnetic cp@xmath10 model . indeed",

    "however , for @xmath32 the behavior of acp@xmath0 models differs from that of ferromagnetic cp@xmath0 models , as we shall show .    keeping the assumption that the critical modes can be represented by local staggered gauge - invariant variables ,",
    "we show that the lgw hamiltonian describing the behavior of the critical modes in the acp@xmath0 models is the one given in eq .",
    "( [ hlg ] ) , without the cubic term , that is with @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , the staggered nature of the order parameter gives rise to a symmetry @xmath33 , which prevents the presence of odd terms in @xmath18 , such as the cubic term .",
    "this fact greatly simplifies the rg analysis of the theory .",
    "in particular , it allows us to predict that the critical behavior of the acp@xmath3 model belongs to the universality class of the o(8 ) vector model , with a dynamical enlargement of the symmetry at the critical point .",
    "correspondingly , we predict @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the acp@xmath3 model , which differ from those found in refs .",
    "@xcite for the ferromagnetic cp@xmath3 universality class .",
    "to validate this prediction , we perform monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the lattice acp@xmath3 and o(8 ) vector models .",
    "the critical exponents and finite - size scaling ( fss ) functions turn out to be the same in the two models , in agreement with the rg argument . finally , we present a general rg study of the lgw theory ( [ hlg ] ) without cubic term .",
    "we compute high - order field - theoretical ( ft ) perturbative series in two different schemes .",
    "the rg analysis does not provide evidence of the existence of stable fp for @xmath24 .",
    "we mention that a critical - point symmetry enlargement analogous to that of acp@xmath3 models occurs in the antiferromagnetic rp@xmath36 model  @xcite .",
    "these systems are similar to those considered here : their hamiltonian is also given by eq .",
    "( [ hcpn ] ) , but the site variable is a _ real _ unit vector .",
    "in the rp@xmath36 case , an analogous rg argument based on the corresponding lgw theory shows that the model should have a critical behavior in the universality class of the o(5 ) vector model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ lgw ] we construct the lgw theory which is expected to describe the critical modes at continuous transitions of acp@xmath0 models , assuming a staggered gauge - invariant order parameter .",
    "[ acp2 ] is devoted to a numerical study of the acp@xmath3 model .",
    "we show that its continuous transition is in the same universality class as that of the o(8 ) vector model . in sec .",
    "[ hopa ] we study the rg flow relevant for models with more components , i.e. , for @xmath24 , computing and analyzing high - order ft perturbative series for the corresponding lgw theories . finally in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] we summarize our main results and draw some conclusions .",
    "some details are reported in the appendices .",
    "we now derive the lgw theory for the critical modes at the transition in acp@xmath0 models , which is completely specified by the symmetry of the model , the nature of the order parameter , and the symmetry - breaking pattern . in the case at hand ,",
    "the model has a global u(@xmath1 ) symmetry and a local u(1 ) gauge invariance .",
    "we assume that the critical modes are effectively represented by local gauge - invariant variables , such as ( [ qdef ] ) . in the case of antiferromagnetic interactions ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "the minimum of the hamiltonian ( [ hcpn ] ) is locally realized by taking @xmath37 for any pair of nearest - neighbor sites .    in order to construct the lgw hamiltonian",
    ", we should identify the order parameter of the transition . at variance with the ferromagnetic case , in the acp@xmath0 model we should take into account the explicit breaking of translational invariance in the low - temperature phase . to clarify the issue ,",
    "let us consider the antiferromagnetic o(@xmath38 ) vector model with hamiltonian @xmath39 . in this case",
    "the order parameter is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the parity of the site @xmath28 defined by @xmath42 . under translations of one site",
    ", we find @xmath43 , hence this parameter allows us to probe the breaking of translational invariance . in the acp@xmath0 model",
    "the natural field variable is the combination @xmath44 , which is invariant under the local u(1 ) gauge transformations of the model .",
    "hence , we define the order parameter @xmath45 it is immediate to verify that @xmath46 is hermitian and traceless [ this follows from the presence of @xmath41 ] , that it changes sign under translations of one site which exchange the two sublattices , and that it coincides with the o(3 ) order parameter for @xmath48 .",
    "then , as usual , in order to construct the lgw model , we replace @xmath46 with a local variable @xmath49 as fundamental variable ( essentially , one may imagine that @xmath49 is defined as @xmath46 , but now the summation extends only over a large , but finite , cubic sublattice ) . then , we write down the most general fourth - order polynomial that is invariant under u(@xmath1 ) transformations and under the @xmath50 transformation @xmath51 , a consequence of the translation invariance of the original theory .",
    "we obtain @xmath52 the original u(@xmath1 ) symmetry corresponds to the symmetry @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath49 is a hermitean traceless matrix as the variable @xmath18 introduced in the ferromagnetic case .",
    "however , because of the presence of the symmetry @xmath55 , which is a specific feature of the antiferromagnetic model , the lgw hamiltonian ( [ ahlg ] ) does not present a cubic term , which instead appears in the @xmath56 hamiltonian ( [ hlg ] ) corresponding to the ferromagnetic case .",
    "note that the model is not only characterized by the symmetry group , but also by the nature of the order parameter .",
    "there are indeed other models with u(@xmath1 ) symmetry ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for an example ) , which , however , have a different order parameter and different symmetry - breaking patterns , leading to different universality classes .    the stability domain of @xmath57 can be determined by studying the asymptotic behavior of the potential @xmath58 this analysis can be easily performed by noting that @xmath59 only depends on the @xmath1 real eigenvalues @xmath60 of the hermitian matrix @xmath49 , which satisfy the condition @xmath61 .",
    "we find that the theory is stable if @xmath62 and if @xmath63 where @xmath64 physical systems corresponding to the effective theory ( [ ahlg ] ) with @xmath65 that do not satisfy these constraints are expected to undergo a first - order phase transition .",
    "the analysis of the minima of the potential @xmath59 for @xmath66 gives us information on the symmetry - breaking patterns .",
    "for @xmath67 , the absolute minimum of @xmath59 is realized by configurations with @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 indicates the @xmath71 identity matrix .",
    "this gives rise to the symmetry - breaking pattern @xmath72 on the other hand , for @xmath73 and even @xmath1 the minumum is realized by @xmath74 implying the symmetry - breaking pattern @xmath75 for @xmath73 and odd values of @xmath1 , we have instead @xmath76 @xmath77 , so that @xmath78 note that for @xmath2 , the symmetry breaking patterns ( [ vnpat ] ) and ( [ vppat2 ] ) are equivalent , hence the sign of @xmath79 does not play any role .",
    "an important remark is in order .",
    "the derivation of the lgw hamiltonian ( [ ahlg ] ) is based on the assumption that the order parameter is the staggered and traceless hermitian matrix ( [ biab ] ) .",
    "this assumption can be checked for @xmath80 . as we show in app .",
    "[ appmin ] , the minimum - energy configurations of hamiltonian ( [ hcpn ] ) for @xmath26 have a very simple structure .",
    "modulo a global u(3 ) transformation , one can take @xmath81 on one sublattice , and @xmath82 on the other one .",
    "hence , a zero - temperature configuration corresponds to @xmath83 therefore , @xmath46 is nonvanishing in the low - temperature phase and represents the correct order parameter .",
    "the symmetry - breaking pattern is therefore that given in eq .",
    "( [ vnpat ] ) or , equivalently , eq .  ( [ vppat2 ] ) .    for @xmath24",
    ", we have not been able to identify ordered zero - temperature configurations that are translation invariant at least on one sublattice , hence , we have not been able to check that @xmath46 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ biab ] ) , is nonvanishing in the low - temperature phase , hence that it can be taken as the order parameter . in the following , we make the working hypothesis that this is the case , determining what this assumption implies for the nature of the transitions in the acp@xmath0 models .    for @xmath2 the lgw theory ( [ ahlg ] ) simplifies .",
    "indeed , one can easily prove that @xmath84 for any @xmath85 traceless hermitean matrix .",
    "then , let us define an 8-component real vector field @xmath86 as follows : @xmath87 where @xmath88 . in terms of the field",
    "@xmath86 we have @xmath89 the , we can rewrite @xmath57 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 , proving that the model is equivalent to the o(8 ) vector theory .",
    "since the o(8 ) vector theory has a stable wilson - fisher fp , the above correspondence allows us to predict that the critical behavior of the acp@xmath3 model must share the same universal features as the 3d o(8 ) vector model .",
    "note that the enlargement of the symmetry to o(8 ) is a feature of the lgw theory ( [ ahlg ] ) , i.e. , of the expansion up to fourth powers of @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , one can easily check that the sixth - order terms allowed by the u(3 ) symmetry , such as @xmath92 , do not share the o(8 ) symmetry . since these terms are rg irrelevant at the o(8 ) fp , the contribution of the terms breaking the o(8 ) symmetry is suppressed at the critical point . in this sense",
    "we have a dynamic enlargement of the symmetry to o(8 ) at the critical point .",
    "of course , the fact that only one quartic term is independent for @xmath2 holds also for the hamiltonian ( [ hlg ] ) corresponding to the ferromagnetic cp@xmath3 model .",
    "thus , it has an o(8 ) fp , which is unstable due to the presence of the cubic term .",
    "this cubic term gives rise to a spin-3 perturbation of the o(8 ) model  @xcite .",
    "its rg dimension @xmath93 can be estimated using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the crossover exponent @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath95 . the crossover exponent @xmath94 at the o(8 ) fp was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , obtaining @xmath96 in the fixed - dimension massive - zero - momentum scheme , and @xmath97 in the @xmath98 expansion . since @xmath99",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ mco8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath100 . as @xmath101 , the o(8 )",
    "fp is unstable in the presence of the cubic term , and , therefore , the o(8 ) fp can not be the stable fp in the case of ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "this is confirmed by the results of refs .",
    "the critical exponents , for instance @xmath22 , significantly differ from those of the o(8 ) universality class .",
    "it is worth mentioning that an analogous enlargement of the symmetry at the critical point is also observed  @xcite in the antiferromagnetic rp@xmath36 model .",
    "the hamiltonian of rp@xmath0 models is analogous to that of cp@xmath0 models it is given by eq .",
    "( [ hcpn ] ) , with real @xmath1-component spins @xmath102 replacing the complex vectors @xmath6 .",

    "( [ ahlg ] ) , with @xmath49 replaced by @xmath103 @xcite . for @xmath2 , the two quartic terms are proportional , and one obtains the @xmath56 theory of the o(5 ) vector model ( again high - order terms break the o(5 ) symmetry , but since they are irrelevant , the o(5 ) symmetry breaking is suppressed in the critical limit ) .",
    "the numerical results of refs .",
    "@xcite for the antiferromagnetic rp@xmath3 model confirm this prediction .    to identify the nature of a critical transition for @xmath24 ,",
    "if it exists , we must determine the fixed points of the rg flow of the lgw theory ( [ ahlg ] ) .",
    "the absence of a stable fp implies the absence of continuous transitions .",
    "such an analysis is quite complex , due to the presence of two quartic terms .",
    "we will perform it in sec .",
    "we now check the predictions of the previous section for the critical behavior of the 3d acp@xmath3 model , confirming that it undergoes a continuous transition in the o(8 ) universality class .      in order to study the critical behavior of the acp@xmath3 lattice model ( [ hcpn ] ) with @xmath104 , we perform monte carlo simulations of cubic systems of linear size @xmath105 with periodic boundary conditions . because of the antiferromagnetic nature of the model we take @xmath105 even . we use a standard metropolis algorithm , hence we are only able to obtain reliable results up to @xmath106 . we use a simple updating algorithm .",
