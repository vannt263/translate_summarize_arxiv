    "theoretical analysis of hadron dynamics in main part relies upon the renormalization group ( rg ) method .",
    "meantime , the construction of exact solutions to the rg equations is still far from being feasible .",
    "usually , in order to describe the strong interaction processes in asymptotical ultraviolet ( uv ) region , one applies the rg method together with perturbative calculations . in this case , the outcoming approximate solutions to the rg equations are used for quantitative analysis of experimental data . however , such solutions have unphysical singularities in the infrared ( ir ) domain , that contradicts the basic principles of local quantum field theory  ( qft ) .    an effective way to overcome such difficulties consists in invoking into consideration the analyticity requirement , which follows from the general principles of local  qft .",
    "this prescription became the underlying idea of the so - called analytic approach to qft , which was first formulated in late 1950s  @xcite . lately",
    "this approach has been extended to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite , and applied to the `` analytization '' of perturbative series for the qcd observables  @xcite .",
    "the term `` analytization '' means the restoring of the correct analytic properties in the @xmath1 variable of a quantity under consideration by making use of the integral representation @xmath2 with the spectral function defined by the initial ( perturbative ) expression for a quantity in hand : @xmath3.\\ ] ]",
    "first of all , let us consider the renormalization group equation for the strong running coupling : @xmath4}{d\\,\\ln\\mu^2 } = \\beta\\bigl(g(\\mu)\\bigr).\\ ] ] in the framework of perturbative approach the @xmath0  function on the right - hand side of this equation can be represented as a power series @xmath5\\!+\\ !",

    "it is well - known that the solution to this equation has unphysical singularities at any loop level .",
    "thus , the strong running coupling gains unphysical singularities due to perturbative approximation of the renormalization group @xmath0  function  ( [ betapertser ] ) .",
    "however , the fundamental principles of local qft require the invariant charge @xmath14 to have a definite analytic properties in the @xmath1 variable .",
    "namely , there must be the only cut along the negative is used , so that positive @xmath1 corresponds to a spacelike momentum transfer . ]",
    "semiaxis of real  @xmath1  @xcite .    in the framework of developed model  @xcite the analyticity requirement",
    "is imposed on the @xmath0  function perturbative expansion for restoring its correct analytic properties .",
    "this leads to the following rg equation for the analytic invariant charge : @xmath15}{d\\,\\ln \\mu^2 } =   - \\left\\{\\sum_{j=0}^{\\ell-1 } b_{j}\\bigl[{\\widetilde{\\alpha}{^{(\\ell)}_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize",

    "so , at the @xmath11-loop level the solution to the rg equation  ( [ anrgeq ] ) takes the form  @xcite : @xmath17,\\ ] ] with @xmath18 \\ln ( 1\\!+\\!\\sigma / z)$ ] , and @xmath19^{j+1 } \\right .",

    "the analytic invariant charge  ( [ aichighloop ] ) possesses a number of appealing features .",
    "first of all , it has no unphysical singularities at any loop level .",
    "then , the developed model contains no adjustable parameters , i.e. , similarly to perturbative approach , remains the basic characterizing parameter of the theory .",
    "the aic also incorporates uv asymptotic freedom with ir enhancement in a single expression , that plays an essential role in applications of developed model .    ) at different loop levels , @xmath22.,width=226 ]     function corresponding to the aic  ( [ aichighloop ] ) at different loop levels .",
    "the one - loop perturbative result is shown as the dot - dashed curve.,width=224 ]    figure  [ fig : aic ] shows the running coupling @xmath23 at different loop levels .",
    "in particular , it is follows from this figure that aic  ( [ aichighloop ] ) possesses a good higher loop stability .",
    "the study of the relevant @xmath0  function at the higher loop levels also enables one to elucidate the asymptotic behavior of the aic .",
    "so , the @xmath0  function in hand @xmath24 was proved to have the universal asymptotics at any loop level  @xcite .",
    "namely , it coincides with the perturbative result @xmath25 at small values of running coupling and tends to the minus unity at large  @xmath26 ( see figure  [ fig : betahl ] ) . in turn",
    ", this trait of the @xmath0  function implies that the aic  ( [ aichighloop ] ) itself possesses the universal asymptotics both in the ultraviolet @xmath27 $ ] and infrared @xmath28 $ ] regions at any loop level .",
    "the detailed analysis of the properties of analytic running coupling can be found in refs .",
    "for the consistent description of some strong interaction processes one has to employ the running coupling in the timelike region . by making use of the prescription elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite the continuation of aic to the timelike domain has recently been performed @xmath29 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) . here",
    "the running coupling in the spacelike region is denoted by @xmath30 and in the timelike region by  @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth noting also that the obtained result  ( [ aictl ] ) confirms the hypothesis due to schwinger concerning proportionality between the @xmath0 function and relevant spectral density ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    ) and timelike  ( [ aictl ] ) regions.,width=226 ]    the plots of the one - loop analytic invariant charge in the spacelike and timelike domains are shown in figure  [ fig : aicst ] . in the ultraviolet limit",
    "these functions have identical behavior determined by the asymptotic freedom . however , there is asymmetry between them in the intermediate- and low - energy regions .",
    "the relative difference between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is about several percents at the scale of the @xmath34  boson mass , and increases when approaching the infrared domain .",
    "apparently , this circumstance must be taken into account when one handles the experimental data .",
    "a decisive test of the self - consistency of any model for the strong interaction is its applicability to description of diverse qcd processes .",
    "( solid curve ) and the quenched lattice data ( @xmath35 ) ; @xmath36mev , @xmath37 .",
    "the dashed curve denotes the relevant perturbative result.,width=226 ]    it was shown @xcite that the analytic running coupling  ( [ aiconeloop ] ) explicitly leads to the confining static quark ",
    "antiquark potential @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a reference scale , and @xmath40 denotes the euler s constant . at the same time",
    ", this potential has the standard behavior , determined by the asymptotic freedom , at small distances .",
    "the potential derived is found to be in a good agreement with the relevant lattice simulation data  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : vr ] ) .",
    "the obtained one - loop estimation of the scale parameter @xmath41mev for @xmath37 active quarks corresponds to the value @xmath42mev in the region of three active quarks ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it was found  @xcite that there are symmetries , which relate the analytic invariant charge and the corresponding @xmath0  function in the uv and ir domains .",
    "one might anticipate that they could also be revealed in some intrinsically nonperturbative strong interaction processes .",
    "it is worth mentioning here the recently discovered symmetry related to the size distribution of instantons  @xmath43 .",
    "namely , the lattice simulation data  @xcite for the quantity @xmath44 , where @xmath45^{2 n_c } \\exp\\!\\left[- \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\alpha(\\rho)}\\right],\\ ] ] have been observed to satisfy the conformal inversion symmetry @xmath46  @xcite . in turn , this relation imposes a certain constraint onto the properties of the qcd running coupling @xmath47 at small and large distances . proceeding from this ,",
    "the analytic invariant charge  ( [ aiconeloop ] ) has recently been rediscovered and proved  @xcite to reproduce explicitly the conformal inversion symmetry of @xmath48 .",
    "the aic has also been applied to description of the gluon condensate ( @xmath49mev ) , inclusive @xmath50  lepton decay ( @xmath51mev ) , and @xmath52  annihilation into hadrons ( @xmath53mev ) .",
    "thus , the applications of the model developed to description of diverse strong interaction processes ultimately lead to congruous estimation of the parameter  @xmath54 .",
    "namely , at the one - loop level with three active quarks @xmath55mev .",
    "apparently , this testifies that the aic substantially incorporates , in a consistent way , both perturbative and intrinsically nonperturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "we have shown that the proposed way of involving the analyticity requirement into the rg  method leads to qualitatively new features of the strong running coupling .",
